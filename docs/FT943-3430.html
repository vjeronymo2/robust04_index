			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / The limits of tax and spend: If Sweden's Social Democrats win Sunday's elections, they will struggle to maintain current welfare spending Mona Sahlin, the popular young party secretary of Sweden's Social Democrats, had a disarmingly frank message for her audience of first-time voters and teachers in a school hall in Stockholm last week. 'If you are a Social Democrat,' she declared, 'you think it is terrific to pay taxes. For me, taxes are the finest expression of what politics is about.' She was answered by a burst of spontaneous applause. Out of place as it might sound in almost any other western nation, Ms Sahlin's statement appears to capture the popular mood in Sweden as the country prepares for a general election next Sunday. Three years after the youthful Mr Carl Bildt came to power at the head of a centre-right coalition declaring the 'Swedish model' to be dead, the appetite for radical reform of the country's famously generous state welfare system has waned. Instead, the Social Democrats - natural party of government in Sweden for most of this century - seem poised to return, promising to defend the welfare state and to raise taxes if necessary to pay for it. Opinion polls show a swing to the left. Most predict Mr Ingvar Carlsson's Social Democrats will lead the next government, either as a minority administration or in alliance with one or more smaller parties of the centre or left. Not surprisingly, the financial markets and Swedish business leaders are worried. This week, the chiefs of Volvo, Ericsson, Stora and ABB's Swedish division - the country's four biggest exporters - joined forces to warn that investment in Sweden was under threat if a new government raised taxes. What preoccupies the financial markets is the size of Sweden's budget deficit - now running at 11 per cent of annual gross domestic product - and its spiralling public sector debt, equivalent to almost 100 per cent of GDP. The fear is that a left-leaning government will be unwilling or unable to force through the tough fiscal policies required to reduce the deficit and bring the debt under control. Such worries have already pushed up interest rates sharply in recent months to levels well above those of Sweden's main European competitors. This in turn has begun to cramp the economic recovery that began late last year: the official forecast for gross national product growth in 1995 has recently been reduced from 3 per cent to about 2 per cent. 'A vicious circle has arisen where interest rates rise further and the domestic economy is hit by a double-dip,' wrote Nordbanken's economists in a report this month warning of further market convulsions if the new government did not quickly get to grips with the deficit. The scale of the problem is enormous - underscored by the fact that after three years of government under a prime minister committed to radical economic reform, the economy is now more dominated by the state than it was when Mr Bildt's four-party coalition took over. Small wonder that many observers question whether a Social Democrat-led government will be able to summon the political will to tackle Sweden's deep structural problems in the public sector. Public expenditure now eats up by far the highest proportion of gross domestic product of any country in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). It has risen to 73 per cent in 1993 from 60 per cent in 1990, compared to an OECD European average of around 50 per cent. Tax revenues as a proportion of GDP are second only to Denmark's at just under 50 per cent. Social benefits account for some 40 per cent of disposable income. More than 30 per cent of the workforce is employed in the public sector, a share some 50 per cent above the level of other smaller European countries. These figures defy the impression promoted by Mr Bildt's government that Sweden has forsaken the egalitarian, statist path relentlessly pursued by the Social Democrats during most of the 53 years they held power between 1932 and 1991. In some respects, however, the figures do Mr Bildt an injustice. One reason for the ballooning budget deficit was the recession he inherited from the previous Social Democrat-led government - Sweden's longest and deepest slump since the 1930s. Unemployment has shot up from less than five per cent of the workforce to around 14 per cent, including those on government-financed training schemes. This has cost the state the equivalent of more than half the budget deficit of SKr180bn (Pounds 15.4bn) in the last budget year. The government was also forced to pledge some Skr90bn in direct aid and guarantees to rescue the banks from a loan-loss crisis that engulfed them in 1992. What is more, Mr Bildt can claim some notable achievements in his bid to redress the structural imbalance in the economy between the public and private sectors. A privatisation programme has raised more than SKr20bn. Deregulation has increased competition in telecommunications and broadcasting - Sweden's telecoms and broadcasting markets are among the most competitive in the world - and is on its way in the energy sector. Capital gains taxes have been reduced and taxes on dividends scrapped. Industry, enjoying an export boom spurred by devaluation and productivity gains, has been unanimous in praising the government for creating a favourable business climate. Even the welfare system has undergone some reforms. A reduction in sickness benefits, for example, has helped slash absenteeism rates - once as high as 25 per cent. The basic rate of unemployment benefit has been brought down from 90 per cent to 80 per cent of previous salary. Perhaps most importantly of all, the Bildt government has negotiated terms for Sweden's entry to the European Union which, if approved in a referendum in November, will shift the country irrevocably away from its traditional isolationist stance and reinforce the pressure on any government in Stockholm to keep the public finances in order. Nor is the Social Democratic party immune to change. It is easy to forget now that during his time in office up to 1991, Mr Ingvar Carlsson, the party leader, presided over a number of significant reforms which stemmed from the realisation that 'the Swedish model' was becoming unsustainable. It was the Social Democrats who instigated financial and currency deregulation, who introduced a landmark reform of the income tax system in 1990, began to introduce contracting out of public services and who, in a radical change of party policy, lodged Sweden's application to join the EU. Ms Sahlin, widely regarded as a likely successor to Mr Carlsson, says the economic crisis that exploded at the turn of the decade awoke the party from 'a fairy tale where we were sleeping without realising what was really going on'. She adds: 'We have tried to stop pretending that everything we had can be kept. We are trying to see what is the essence of the Swedish model, to see which parts we can keep. We will cut down what you get from benefits in order to sustain the schools, the welfare and the child care systems.' An example of the path Sweden might follow lies in Denmark, which was confronted with a similar crisis in the early 1980s. In 1982, a new government dominated by the Conservative party of Mr Poul Schluter and the right-wing Liberals of Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen embraced a tough fiscal and monetary programme which eventually brought the public finances into balance. But that coalition was in power for an uninterrupted 10 years. State spending is still above 60 per cent of Denmark's GDP - and the welfare state is still at the centre of political controversy, with Denmark facing its own election three days after Sweden's. The Danish achievement now looks beyond the grasp of Mr Bildt, whose Moderate party, with a support base of no more than 22 per cent of the Swedish electorate, is the only mainstream Swedish party fully committed to radical structural change. Ms Birgitta Swedenborg, deputy director of the Swedish Centre for Business and Policy Studies, says the reforms enacted by the Bildt government have been limited in part because the Liberal and Centre party coalition partners never shared the enthusiasm for a radical change of direction shown by the Moderates. 'The realisation that the Swedish model didn't work never did run very deep in Sweden,' she says. 'People are still accustomed to thinking that the Swedish model is something other countries seek to emulate. They don't realise that the Swedish model is something most countries are warned against these days.' The Social Democrats readily accept that current levels of public expenditure are unsustainable. Mr Goran Persson, the shadow finance minister, is regarded as a tough pragmatist who is determined to cut the budget deficit. He has proposed a package of tax increases and spending cuts which would narrow the budget gap by SKr61bn over four years, and stop the public debt growing by 1998. He has also said that if this does not prove sufficient he will come back for more. At the same time, the Social Democrats want to stimulate growth to reduce unemployment. They are promising investment incentives and even corporate tax cuts. Ms Sahlin, a former labour minister, talks of the need for flexibility and reform in a labour market still marked by low wage differentials and rigidities in hire-and-fire rules. What the Social Democrats have been careful not to do is set a target for reducing the public sector. Their approach is essentially defensive, seeking to preserve as much of the old system as possible. This commitment is extremely attractive in a country where up to two-thirds of the electorate depends on the public sector for the bulk of personal income - either through direct employment or welfare benefits. The regiment of state-dependent families forms a formidable constituency against radical reform of the system. 'People have seen some changes over the past three years and they didn't like them very much,' says Mr Olle Westberg, editor of Expressen, the country's biggest-selling newspaper and until last year chief aide to Mrs Anne Wibble, the current finance minister. 'What we are seeing now is a kind of nostalgia - a longing for what we had before. This is the problem for the Social Democratic election campaign. They warn of hard times still to come, but they somehow transmit the feeling that it is possible to go back to where we were before.' The Social Democrats' proposals on the budget deficit were cautiously welcomed in the financial markets and helped stem the recent rise in interest rates. But their plan falls well short of the spending cuts proposed by Mr Bildt's government, and the emphasis on tax rises has brought strong criticism from industry that the package was likely to deter investment rather than encourage it. Behind criticism of proposals made by Mr Persson, the shadow finance minister, lies a lingering fear that the Social Democrats, faced with a choice between deep cuts in the welfare system and printing money to finance its preservation, will choose the inflationary route as they did consistently in the 1980s. There is, however, an important difference with the past. Assuming that voters approve EU membership in their November referendum - and the Social Democratic party leadership will campaign strongly for a Yes vote - the government in Stockholm will no longer have the freedom to inflate its way out of trouble. It will find itself obliged to meet the demanding criteria for budgetary and economic convergence set by the Maastricht treaty. In its report on the Swedish economy early this year, the OECD warned that at some stage Swedes would have to choose either to shift emphatically away from universal welfare provision to a more selective system, or dramatically reduce the generosity of provisions. 'The current situation is one where changes of the system are urgently needed. Given that the limits to sound financing of welfare expenditure have already been surpassed, the country simply cannot continue as if nothing has happened,' the OECD said. 'It must be made clear that there is no way without sacrifice to stem the rising tide of unemployment and budget deficits and to improve allocative efficiency.' Mr Bildt's government has made a start in tough circumstances. It is doubtful, however, that a new government after Sunday will have much of a mandate to continue the task. And the economic and political circumstances are, if anything, getting more difficult.</p>

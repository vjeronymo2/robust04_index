			<p><P> February 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RETURN OF THE CELLULOID RHINESTONE AND OLD PASTE  </P> <P> Vintage jewelry is having its moment -- again. Ask Joan Collins, Diana Ross,  Cher, Farrah Fawcett. All of them are clients of Connie Parente, a jewelry  collector who lately has supplied the stars, and anybody else who likes the  aging baubles, from her Ali Baba-like studio in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Madonna, who was covered with Parente's trinkets for her "Material Girl" music  video, picked up another stash for a new video in the works.  </P> <P> Consequently, Parente has made a living out of a childhood passion. Growing up  in St. Louis she played with costume jewelry from the '20s and '30s that her  mother's friends passed on to her. At the local department store she made a  beeline to the estate jewelry counter.  </P> <P> "I always loved old stuff," she says, "the voluptuous, romantic pieces. Finally  I couldn't stand it; it drove me crazy. I just wanted jewelry."  </P> <P> In 1969 when she moved to Los Angeles, a career was born. To make a living and  do what she loved, she began going to flea markets and swap meets where she  would buy, and later resell.  </P> <P> She collected rhinestone bracelets from the '20s made from the same celluloid  as movie film. Later the material was declared illegal because of its  flammability. Now, celluloid rhinestones are very rare. She bought Bakelite  plastic jewelry from the '30s and '40s, now prized by collectors.  </P> <P> The serious collector buys with an eye toward design, color and craftsmanship,  Parente says.  </P> <P> The hottest name these days is Miriam Haskell, whose '40s pearls and  baroque-style jewelry has skyrocketed in price in the last year and a half,  Parente explains.  </P> <P> Parente's first rule of flea market shopping for jewelry is this: be sure  stones are securely set and clasps work. Repair jobs can cost more than the  original purchase.  </P></p>

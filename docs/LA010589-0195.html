			<p><P> January 5, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GUYS AND GALLLEYS: GRANDMA'S NO-FUSS FUDGE RECIPE CREATED A RUCKUS WHEN TIME  CAME TO COOK  </P> <P> We're going to start the new year off by cleaning up the old-year mess we  created -- judging from the letters and phone calls -- in many Orange County  kitchens.  </P> <P> The Grandma's No-Fuss Cashew Fudge recipe we carried several weeks ago turned  out to be star-crossed indeed. First, we inadvertently omitted a key direction  (to melt the butter and chocolate by pouring boiling syrup over it), something  we corrected two days later.  </P> <P> Then we began receiving calls from readers who seemed most rankled at the line  in the article that said anyone who "could boil water or plug in a mixer,"  including a 10-year-old of our acquaintance, could make the fudge with ease. It  seems they could not.  </P> <P> "I can boil water and I can use an electric mixer," fumed June Drury, "but what  a mess I got into trying to make Granny's fudge!"  </P> <P> Toba V. Wheeler of Irvine agreed. "As I was stirring and stirring and stirring,  . . . I wondered how on earth a 10-year-old could possibly have the strength  and stamina to perform the chore -- I was exhausted before I even put the pan  on the stove."  </P> <P> She wound up with "a bowlful of granulated sugar globs and hard sugar lumps and  these, too, started flying out of the (mixer) bowl and all over the counter,  walls, floor, hands and blouse."  </P> <P> "That was the final straw and I gave up," she said.  </P> <P> We were, if possible, more perplexed than they. It is, after all, an old family  recipe -- tested and proved through several generations of use.  </P> <P> But both Wheeler and Drury hit on the problem in their respective letters.  </P> <P> "I have made tons of fudge, but . . . I thought this (recipe) was special since  it called for condensed milk, instead of evaporated milk," Drury said.  </P> <P> Wrote Wheeler: " . . . There is no way 4 1/2 cups of sugar could dissolve in 12  ounces of condensed milk."  </P> <P> That, indeed, was the wrinkle. The ingredients should have read evaporated  milk, not condensed. So we are reprinting the corrected recipe this week, with  apologies to those who wrote or called and also those who didn't. And to those  whose smoke alarms were activated by neighbors laboring over Grandma's no-fuss  fudge.  </P> <P> We also managed to ruffle a few other feathers during the holidays by not  telling readers where they could purchase a key ingredient -- plums and tapioca  -- in the sugarplum cake recipe published the week before Christmas. The  answer: in the junior baby foods section of any supermarket.  </P> <P> Other than these two omissions, Guys &amp; Galleys enjoyed an interesting and  positive year.  </P> <P> The guys who shared their recipes during 1988 -- and the recipes themselves --  mirrored the county's remarkable social, economic and ethnic diversity.  </P> <P> The contributors ranged from an unemployed construction worker to a master of  high finance. Scattered in between were several attorneys, a punk rock  musician, a publicist, a couple of retirees, a bartender, a psychologist, a  comedian and a doctor, among others.  </P> <P> Their recipes also ran the gamut, from French and Italian to German and  Oriental, from Mexican to Spanish (there's a big difference), from Mideastern  to Midwestern.  </P> <P> We nibbled on buffalo wings with a bartender in San Juan Capistrano and sampled  barbecued fish aboard an advertising executive's yacht in Newport Harbor. We  also strolled with an author-musician-therapist through his herb garden in  Corona del Mar and slurped clam chowder brewed on the beach by a band of  lifeguards in Laguna Beach.  </P> <P> We thank them all for sharing their recipes and for taking the time to prepare  the dishes for our photographers.  </P> <P> Now it's time to rustle up some cooks for the new year. If you are a guy who  likes to cook -- or know one -- drop us a line at Guys &amp; Galleys, Orange  County Life, The Times, 1365 Sunflower Ave., Costa Mesa, Calif. 92626.  </P> <P> THE CORRECTED GRANDMA'S NO-FUSS CASHEW FUDGE  </P> <P> Ingredients  </P> <P> 4 1/2 cups sugar  </P> <P> 1 twelve-ounce can evaporated milk  </P> <P> 12 one-ounce squares bittersweet chocolate  </P> <P> 1/2 pound butter  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon vanilla, brandy or rum  </P> <P> 1/2 pound cashew pieces  </P> <P> Preparation  </P> <P> In a large heavy saucepan, mix sugar and evaporated milk. Sprinkle on 1/2  teaspoon salt. Mix again and slowly bring mixture to bubbling boil. Immediately  reduce heat and simmer for 14 minutes, stirring frequently. While sugar-milk  mixture is cooking, break chocolate pieces in half, place in large mixing bowl  and add butter in chunks. Sprinkle on remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. Remove  sugar-milk mixture from heat and pour over butter and chocolate. Blend with  electric mixer on low. Increase speed of mixer to high and beat for 10 minutes.  Add vanilla, rum or brandy and nuts. Mix with spoon and spread in buttered  pans. Chill several hours.  </P></p>

"Frankly speaking, an early breakthrough on the issue is  unlikely, " Deputy Foreign Minister Koichiro Matsuura, a chief  negotiator in the Japan-U.S. trade framework talks, said in a  speech sponsored by the Japan National Press Club.    Terming solution of the issue "very difficult," Matsuura  proposed holding informal sessions between the two countries.    Bilateral negotiations on a governmental basis are limited  following the collapse of the framework talks during the  Japan-U.S. summit earlier this month, he said.    As part of efforts to mend the soured economic relations  with  Washington, Matsuura cited the need for Japan to cut its global  current-account surplus "significantly" within four to five  years, in line with the Japan-U.S. accord last July.    As a first step, Tokyo should achieve its economic target  for  fiscal 1994 of cutting the ratio of the global current-account  surplus against gross domestic product to 2.8 percent from about  3.1 percent estimated for the current year, he said.    Achieving that figure would lead to a reduction in Japan's  trade surplus with the U.S., which accounted for more than half  of its global surplus of nearly 120 billion dollars in calendar  1993, Matsuura said.    He said the state of the U.S. trade balance with Japan is  like "a thermometer gauging U.S. harshness against Tokyo."    Matsuura called for U.S. efforts to reduce its budget  deficit, expand savings and increase industrial competitiveness,  in line with its commitments shown in the July 1993 meeting  between then Japanese Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and U.S.  President Bill Clinton.    Matsuura criticized the U.S. for threatening to scrap a  global trade accord proposal on electronic components.    Washington recently unveiled a plan to retract a 60 percent  to 70 percent cut in tariffs on electronic parts as agreed under  the Uruguay Round of multilateral talks sponsored by the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).    The U.S. said it will opt for the step because Japan has  rejected a U.S. call for removal of wood product tariffs in  Japan. Tokyo agreed in the Uruguay Round to halve the tariffs.    The latest U.S. action is "unconvincing" in terms of the  procedure of the global trade talks, Matsuura said.    The concluded Uruguay Round allowed for additional offers by  GATT member countries before February 15 only when such offers  are regarded as steps leading to further market opening,  Matsuura said.    On the overall Japan-U.S. relations, Matsuura said the two  countries should do their utmost to prevent the current economic  friction from impinging on other aspects like political problems.    It would reflect a "relationship of grown-ups" if the matter  is handled at an economic level and prevented from worsening the  overall relations of the two countries, he said.</p>

			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Global link set up to issue information AN electronic World Press Centre designed to link organisations issuing information with journalists all over the world has been created with venture-capital backing. The London-based computer centre, which is already operational, has the support of organisations such as the World Bank and Unesco. Governments, international agencies, businesses and pressure groups will send their press information electronically to the London centre, and it can be read electronically anywhere by journalists. Unlike normal day-to-day storage, information in the World Press Centre is organised in a series of electronic pigeonholes. Journalists interested in climactic change, international trade or health, for instance, can simply dip into the relevant pigeonhole to see whether there have been any releases on their subject. Press releases can be made available instantly all over the world to journalists, normally at local telephone call rates. There will be also be multi-language versions. Former journalist Mr Peter Thompson, founder of the centre and who trained as an economist, has been working on the system for eight years. He believes he is well on the way to beating the 'chicken and egg' problem - information providers using the system only when they are confident that newspapers and broadcasters are also using it. Lord Grenfell, chief of external affairs at the European office of the World Bank, said: 'Our feeling is that we now have a system into which we can feed a great deal of information of interest to the end users and indeed we are now feeding in such material on a regular basis.' Mr Rod Fenwick, a senior marketing executive at Atex, the supplier of computerised newsroom systems, said the company is investigating the possibility of adding the World Press Centre software to its systems as added value. In the developed world the operation will be a profit-making venture but the developing world will be charged at cost. Subscriptions will be about Pounds 10 per week for each individual using the centre.</p>

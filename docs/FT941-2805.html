			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / International Capital Markets: Wharf wins race for S&amp;P debt rating Wharf (Holdings) has become the first big Hong Kong conglomerate to receive a publicly-declared long-term debt rating. Standard and Poor's rating agency has awarded it an implied senior rating of A, writes Louise Lucas. This is the maximum possible, as it matches that assigned to the HK government. Wharf clinched it ahead of Swire Pacific, the conglomerate which is also seeking a debt rating. It will facilitate any plans by Wharf to tap international debt markets.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Government and opposition representatives have  agreed on eight initial amendments to the Constitution,  including reducing the size of the Senate, Chumphon  Sinlapa-acha, chairman of the House special committee on  constitutional amendments, said yesterday.    However, it was still not clear last night whether the  opposition as a whole would support the agreement.    Speaking after a meeting called by Parliament President  Marut  Bunnak, Chumphon said agreement had been reached in principle on  all 25 proposals put forward by his committee.    They agreed that priority should be given to eight  amendments:    -- To reduce the voting age from 20 to 18.    -- To vary the number of MPs in line with the increase in  population.    -- To reduce the minimum number of candidates a political  party must field in general elections to one-fourth of the total  number of House of Representatives seats.    -- To give House committees more power.    -- The leader of the largest opposition party be  automatically named opposition leader.    -- To allow immediate consideration by the House of  motions put forward as a matter of urgency.    -- To establish an administration court.    -- To reduce the number of senators to one-third of MPs.    "I am pleased that changes to the Constitution will be  made,"  Chumphon said.    Chat Phatthana Party Secretary-General Prachuap Chaiyasan  said it was possible to amend the eight points, but he could not  give a guarantee. Yesterday's meeting had made progress, but  whether the changes would be passed depended on a compromise.    Prachuap also asked the government to call a special House  session to deliberate the amendments. Solidarity Party deputy  leader Khanin Bunsuwan said changes to the charter were likely  as a result of the meeting.    Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said earlier yesterday he was  confident of changes to the Constitution, but not all the 25  points.    "I think that the points which are agreed to (by the  government and the opposition) could be changed. But it is  difficult to amend all 25 points because of different opinions,"  he said.    The opposition parties on Tuesday resolved that all 25  proposals should be included in a single bill. The government  would prefer to initially amend six points. Each side has  accused the other of insincerity in pushing for a more  democratic constitution.    Chuan claimed that the suggestion to consider all amendments  as a single bill had not been agreed to by all opposition  members. He said all parties should cooperate on the amendments.    Chuan said separate bills would make the changes easier. If  a bill failed to pass through the parliament, legislators could  propose another bill, he said.    It would not hurt the government or the opposition if a  particular amendment did not materialize. Both camps want  changes for a better constitution.    Deputy Prime Minister Bunchu Rotchanasathian said it would  be  impossible to get agreement on making all 25 changes in one  bill. His Phalang Tham Party had resolved to amend about five  points of the charter, he said.    He said failure to amend the Constitution would affect  Parliament's image, just the government's. Opposition Prachakon  Thai leader Samak Suntharawet said the 25 points should be  considered as separate bills.</p>

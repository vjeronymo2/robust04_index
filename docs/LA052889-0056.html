			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE MAJESTY OF THE ROCKIES;  </P> <P> JASPER NATIONAL PARK CONTAINS SOME OF THE MOST EYE-CATCHING SCENERY IN NORTH  AMERICA. AN UNSPOILED WILDERNESS OF JAGGED MOUNTAINS, LAKES AND RIVER,  GLACIERS, WATERFALLS AND HUGE ICE FIELDS GREET THE VISITOR.  </P> <P> Those grand old resorts, Banff and Lake Louise, may be the best-known jewels in  Alberta's Rocky Mountain crown, but the wonders are no less spectacular in  adjacent Jasper National Park.  </P> <P> Arriving in Edmonton by jet,the province in spring or early summer resembles a  giant tapestry in various shades of green. From jagged snow-capped peaks to the  west, icy rivers twist and cascade into mirror lakes. Fertile valleys give way  to cattle ranches and wheat fields that stretch for miles across the prairie.  </P> <P> Snuggled up against the Continental Divide, Jasper National Park, named after  oldtime trapper and company clerk Jasper Hawes, was founded in 1907 and covers  roughly 4,200 square miles of some of North America's most eye-catching  scenery.  </P> <P> Here, about a four- to five-hour drive west of Edmonton, Canadians and visitors  alike can -- depending upon the season -- hike, fish, camp, climb, raft, ride,  ski or simply gaze in awe at the beauty around them.  </P> <P> "The last wild elk, bighorn sheep, mountain goats, grizzly and black bears will  live in these national parks," naturalist and writer Ben Gould once said. "In  the near future, the only wilderness left in the world will be protected in  such parks.  </P> <P> "People will learn to enjoy not having roads up the canyons, not seeing  buildings of any kind. Visitors who experience the grandeur, the pungent  aromas, the silence, the refreshment of having a mountain virtually to  themselves, become wilderness activists."  </P> <P> There is no better introduction to the majesty of the Canadian Rockies than by  taking the aerial tramway up The Whistlers Mountain. The 20-minute ascent in  the gondola delivers passengers to a restaurant at the upper terminal, where  breakfast, lunch and dinner are served on three glass-enclosed terraces.  </P> <P> From there, at 6,700 feet, visitors can climb the alpine hiking trail to the  summit for an eagle's-eye view of 12,929-foot Mt. Robson, the highest peak in  the Canadian Rockies, the Athabasca Valley and the Columbia Icefield. Also  visible from the windswept ridges are spectacular Maligne Canyon and the  turquoise waters of Maligne Lake, the second-largest glacial lake in the world.  </P> <P> Dropping back down below the timberline, take the Icefield Parkway, which links  Jasper to Lake Louise, for a close-up view of the glaciers. Sights not to be  missed include the Athabasca Glacier and the Sunwapta and Athabasca falls.  </P> <P> At the Athabasca Falls, river-rafting guide Mike Szkorupa and his colleagues,  passionate environmentalists all, take visitors on foaming, roller-coaster  rides in inflatable boats.  </P> <P> Seven to a boat, participants in rubber suits and life jackets are given a  brief orientation from their helmsman/guide, then find themselves paddling  through the rapids or coasting in quiet pools for three hours before pulling up  on a beach for a lunch break.  </P> <P> For some, the most exhilarating wilderness experience is an afternoon hike up  to Athabasca Glacier, one of dozens of glaciers making up the Columbia  Icefield, which, at 150 square miles, represents the largest accumulation of  ice and snow south of the Arctic Circle.  </P> <P> Although Athabasca Glacier can be viewed from the comfort of a snow coach, on a  fine day the gradual climb with mountain guide Peter Lemieux is much the best  way to go.  </P> <P> The Columbia Icefield is a true "continental divide." Its meltwaters feed  streams and rivers that pour into the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic  to the east and the Pacific to the southwest.  </P> <P> An information center houses a scale model of the entire ice fields area, and  the audiovisual display, too, is worth a look-in.  </P> <P> In all, Jasper National Park is crisscrossed with more than 625 miles of  backcountry trails, each one of them offering something new around the next  bend.  </P> <P> The town of Jasper itself lies in a broad valley where the Athabasca and Miette  rivers meet. Less hectic than Banff, even in the high season, it did not really  begin to develop until the railway reached town in 1911.  </P> <P> Souvenir and crafts shops line the main street but, not surprisingly, it is the  countryside and not the town that visitors come to Jasper to see.  </P> <P> Those who want to prolong their enjoyment of the Rockies can leave Jasper on  the 8 p.m. train and enjoy the mountains from their table in the diner. In  summer, en route to Vancouver, a late-setting sun affords hours of pleasurable  travel while the scenery rolls by.  </P> <P> Still lakes reflect evergreens and peaks aglow in orange light. The track  follows the swift Fraser River with its islands of dense fir and spruce, its  beaver dams, moose drinking at the water's edge, caribou and elk grazing in the  meadows and solitary Indians spearing salmon, their nets drying on rock  outcroppings.  </P> <P> At one place, a waterfall is cantilevered across the tracks.  </P> <P> Compartment windows are wide and clean, but if you want a bigger picture find a  seat in the dome car, where the conductor might even have a tale or two to tell  about the passing country.  </P> <P> Canadian passenger trains can be sidetracked for a freight. Being late is only  a bonus for true train buffs. Later at night, passengers can watch the  constellations swing into different positions as the train winds through  Yellowhead Pass and across scores of high bridges. The 18-hour trip costs $128  Canadian.  </P> <P> The colorful 190-page "Scenic Rail Guide to Western Canada" by Bill Coo is a  perfect companion, providing maps, history and local lore. Coo, a lifelong  railroader, includes locations of the Hudson's Bay Company trading posts, a  description of the blind mice that live in one five-mile tunnel, stories of the  monumental struggles to lay these tracks (camels and mules were used to climb  "the hill of despair," where the last spike was driven), plus facts on  pioneers, wildlife and side trips with the Canadian National and Canadian  Pacific system.  </P> <P> The paperback can be obtained for $10 plus $2 for postage and handling by  contacting VIA Collector's Corner, P.O. Box 1418, Postal Station B, Downsview,  Ontario, M3H 5W3.  </P> <P>  -- -- --  </P> <P> Jasper can be reached by air from Los Angeles by flying either to Edmonton or  Calgary.

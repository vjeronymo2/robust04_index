			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> EL CAMINO AND TAFT SQUARE OFF  </P> <P> El Camino College football Coach John Featherstone calls Saturday's matchup  between the Warriors and Taft the community college game of the week.  </P> <P> The Warriors (1-0) are the state's top-ranked team, according to the Junior  College Athletic Bureau.  </P> <P> Taft is rated third.  </P> <P> In 1987, both teams went to the Pony Bowl undefeated, and El Camino walked away  with 24-7 victory and a national championship. El Camino hasn't forgotten that  game, which many believed the Warriors didn't stand a chance of winning.  </P> <P> "Taft is always very strong on both sides of the ball," Featherstone said.  "They always have a fast, physical defense and an absolute machine on offense.  This will be the test for us."  </P> <P> The Warriors' offense, which features a lot of running, looked impressive in  last week's opener against Ventura. But Featherstone said things will be  different Saturday.  </P> <P> "Without a question, Taft will be the toughest defense we will face this  season," he said. "We'll really know where we're at in terms of our running  game after Saturday."  </P> <P> The Cougars haven't played this season, so Featherstone is basing his  prediction on Taft's strength and consistency throughout the years. Last year  the Cougars went undefeated (9-0-1) and beat Bakersfield in the Shrine Potato  Bowl.  </P> <P> Game time is 7 p.m. at El Camino's Murdock Stadium.  </P> <P> Harbor College will open its season against visiting Victor Valley on Saturday  at 7:30 p.m.  </P> <P> Victor Valley lost to Porterville, 14-10, in its opener last week.  </P> <P> The Seahawks and the Rams are unranked and looking to improve last year's  dismal records. Under first-year Coach Don Weems, Harbor finished last in the  Northern Division of the Western State Conference with a 2-7 record, 3-7  overall. Victor Valley (0-8, 1-9) finished last in the nine-member Foothill  Conference.  </P> <P> L.A. Southwest is off and plays Harbor on Sept. 22.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Relayed by Warsaw TV Polonia Network] </F>   [Excerpts] The Sejm debate on the government draft budget  has revealed that both in the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] and in  the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] there are groups of deputies  critical of actions being taken by Waldemar Pawlak's cabinet.  If the commissions do not propose increased expenditure on  agriculture and social welfare, 30 to 40 coalition deputies are  prepared to vote against the budget. The coalition has,  however, such a majority in the parliament that even a loss of a  double this number of votes cannot undermine the government.    [Correspondent] The most dissatisfied are some National  Trade  Union Alliance [OPZZ] deputies, whose leader in the SLD  parliamentary floor group is Stanislaw Wisniewski. Deputy  Wisniewski is of the opinion that, if during work on the budget  it is not possible to increase funding for social welfare,  active combatting of unemployment, and restructuring of the most  threatened regions, the OPZZ should vote against the budget.  [passage omitted]    In the PSL, a group of about 20 deputies from the  [organization of] agricultural circles is the most critical of  the draft budget. The board [of the organization] instructed its  parliamentarians to vote against the government if the funding  for agriculture is not increased from 2 billion to 6 billion  zlotys. Some PSL activists are of the opinion that the SLD  coalition members want to discriminate against agriculture.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jean-Francois Jacquier: "SNECMA: Three </F> Challenges To Meet by 1997"--first paragraph is L'USINE NOUVELLE  introduction]    [Text] New markets, new alliances, and shortened  production cycles. The French engine builder believes the only  way to pull out of the recession is to break with the past...    "We're not going to see another `miracle' like the CFM-56.  Our competitors will not allow it." Financial problems, battles  for technology, collapsing markets: Yves Bonnet, general manager  of SNECMA [National Company for Aircraft Engine Design and  Construction], knows the company can count on very little  outside support in its struggle for economic recovery.    In a sector likely to see increasing concentration, SNECMA  has no choice. If it wants to defend its position, its markets,  and its research, it must get back into the black as soon as  possible.  <H5>  New Markets </H5>   Once a supplier of products for exclusively military use,  SNECMA has succeeded over the last 5 years in becoming the third  largest company in its field, thanks to a cooperative alliance  forged 20 years ago with global leader General Electric [GE]  (United States). The market-penetration achieved by the CFM-56  family of jet engines under a 50-50 partnership with GE lifted  it to the ranks of a world-class engine builder. With 6,500  units in service for close to 200 clients, the CFM-56 is the  world's best-selling jet engine.    Alas! It has had to pay a price for this success. When the  full force of the recession in the air transport market hit,  SNECMA was too much a one-product company. CFM-56 deliveries  dropped from 900 in 1991 to 500 in 1993, resulting in a  30-percent decline in sales volume. In the last 2 years, it has  suffered annual losses of 600 to 700 million [French] francs  [Fr]. The group suddenly realized it was overly dependent on GE.  If business generated by the partnership with the Cincinnati  engine builder were to decline further, 75 percent of its  activity would be threatened.    Thus the company had to take action. Especially since its  president, Gerard Renon, does not expect an overall recovery in  the sector before 1997. "Even then," he says, "only companies  that have developed new products will survive." So SNECMA  decided to gamble: It would expand its product offerings in a  bid to secure new market outlets. This meant branching out to  the civilian sector, of course, but also broadening its military  base. Formerly it supplied warplane engines only to Dassault,  but now it is prepared to equip foreign aircraft too, though the  latter are not really competitors to any great extent. It has  recently proposed building a new version of the M-88, the  Rafale's engine, to power the Swedes' Grippen. Discussions are  also under way with South Korea on provision of a modified M-88  to power a single-engine trainer.    In the civilian market, a number of needs have been  identified. First, at the low end, for regional aircraft with  fewer than 100 seats, demand for which is going to accelerate in  Europe and Asia. Looking ahead to the year 2009, replacement of  the oldest Airbuses (A300 and A310) should open up opportunities  for engines with thrust in the range of 40-50,000 pounds. Over  the longer term, finally, a successor to the CFM-56 will need to  be developed.  <H5>  New Alliances </H5>   The problem is, with development costs for a new engine  starting at a minimum of Fr1 billion, SNECMA may not be in a  position to follow through. It now spends close to Fr4 billion  per year--about 31 percent of total sales revenue--on research  and industrial development. It is no longer able to sustain that  spending level, which is substantially greater than the  percentages spent by rivals (15 to 20 percent). Both its  adversaries (Rolls-Royce, Pratt &amp; Whitney) and its principal  partner (GE) are two to four times as big.    In order to compensate for this handicap, and despite the  fact that "cooperation with GE remains indispensable," the  French firm has entered into a number of alliances with new  partners. With Rolls-Royce, SNECMA is working to acquire  technology for the warplanes of the 21st century. Also in the  military domain, it has just signed a preliminary agreement with  Russia's Mikoyan for manufacture under license of the Larzac, an  engine developed in association with Turbomeca. Another accord  has just been concluded with Germany's MTU and Italy's Fiat Avio  for research on an engine for the FLA, the future European  tactical transport aircraft.    In the field of low-power civilian engines, those targeted  at  the regional aircraft market, SNECMA has signed letters of  intent to cooperate not only with GE but also with MTU [Motor  and Turbine Union, Inc.] and Pratt &amp; Whitney. The partnership  would be based on development of a civilian spinoff of the M-88  that may also be of interest to the Japanese for their YSX.  Other discussions are under way with Russia's Perm for a  40,000-pound [i.e., thrust] engine, a market niche where GE is  not a player.  <H5>  Production Cycles </H5>   Obviously, such a policy would have no chance of succeeding  unless SNECMA had some good technological arrows in its quiver.  Even so, it will need to redouble its efforts to improve  productivity. The objective is to reduce both costs (30 percent)  and development time (1 year) for new engines. To meet new  demands, the company's production facilities are going to have  to match the faster pace set by airplane builders. For example,  now that Boeing has decided to shorten production time for its  airplanes from 18 to 14 months by 1996, SNECMA will have to  deliver its engines in 4-1/2 instead of 6 months, if it wants to  remain a player.    That means a complete overhaul of work procedures, including  elimination of excess layers of hierarchy, autonomy for  production units, creation of expertise hubs that bring together  research laboratories, study bureaus, and the manufacturing  side. A breakdown of old structures is under way.    "Aeronautics is no longer a separate industry," proclaims  Jacques Bouhelier, the just-named director for comprehensive  quality control. "In the future, engine-building will evolve  more in the direction of client services," confirms Alain  Habrard, director of development. Airlines will not want to have  to worry about repair or maintenance of their engines. There  will come a time when they want services at flight time. SNECMA  has already begun offering this type of contract, and is  considering a top-to-bottom overhaul of its commercial network.    If it perseveres to the end, the state-owned company's  gamble  will pay off. The most difficult part will be getting back into  the profit column within the next 2 to 3 years. SNECMA may be in  a position then to make a comeback and take in private-sector  shareholders. Solid financial footing, broad international  base--the vision is well fleshed-out. But just bringing in  private investors will not substitute for the planned reforms,  which are essential if the company is to prosper in a highly  competitive market.    [box, p 24]  <H5>  Subsidiaries Adapting </H5>   In 1993, only two of SNECMA's five subsidiaries--SEP, which  builds the Ariane's engines, and Techspace Aero, formerly FN  [National Arms Factory] Engines, in Belgium--posted profits.  Gerard Renon, the group's president, offers this analysis: "In  an environment of such frenzied competition, we can no longer  let them remain simple subcontractors for the parent company."  Their survival depends on their ability to establish themselves  as prime contractors on the international market. An objective  which in most cases means more alliances. Thus Messier-Bugatti  has decided to join forces with Britain's Dowty in the  landing-gear domain. In the field of engine nacelles and thrust  reversers, Hispano-Suiza is entering into collaboration with  Grumman (United States). Sochata's maintenance activities may be  reintegrated into SNECMA itself. [end box]    [box, p 25]  <H5>  Technological Strike Force </H5>   SNECMA's strength depends on the upstream organization of  its research effort, which is based on a network of 80 research  organs, laboratories, and universities both in France (ONERA  [National Office for Aerospace Studies and Research], CNRS  [National Scientific Research Center], CART, etc.) and overseas  (Europe, the United States, Russia). Forced to compensate for  its relatively small size, it gets as much mileage as possible  from computer simulation, which saves time and avoids costly  testing. Starting from scratch after the Liberation [i.e., near  the end of World War II], SNECMA is one of the few engine  builders in the world that has been able to design and build  military aircraft engines without external assistance. The M-88,  developed for Dassault's Rafale, is a distillation of expertise  that will offer performance superior to that of any competitor.  Compared with the J200 destined for the EFA [European Fighter  Aircraft] and Pratt &amp; Whitney's ATF [advanced tactical  fighter]  engine in particular, it will offer higher turbine injection  temperatures and an unprecedented thrust-to-mass ratio on the  order of 10 daN/kg. That presupposes complete mastery of new  materials technologies. Likewise, in the civilian domain, SNECMA  has obtained remarkable blower efficiency and compression rates.  These technological advances have not been purchased at a cost  to reliability. For example, the failure-in-flight rate of the  CFM-56-3 is almost 20 times less than that of rival  Rolls-Royce's V 2500. With some 2,000 engineers on its rolls,  "SNECMA is, from a technical standpoint, up there with the  best--perhaps even better," boasts Jacques Caruel, the group's  technical director.  <H5>  SNECMA Engines </H5>    -  CFM-56: The result of a 50-50  partnership with GE, it has made SNECMA a leader in the civilian  market, with 6,500 units in service.    -  M-88: Developed for  Dassault's Rafale, it is a distillation of the most advanced  technologies. It will be offered for export in various versions.    -  GE-90: With so much experience under its belt, SNECMA is now  moving ahead on the GE-90, the world's largest aircraft engine.  Its new objective: to be prime contractor for a major civilian  program. [end box]</p>

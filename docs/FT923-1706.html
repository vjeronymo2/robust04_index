			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Technology: PC discs sent down the phone Sending printed documents has become effortless, thanks to the widespread availability of facsimile machines. But when it comes to sending material from one personal computer to another, even seasoned PC users often find the task daunting. At the moment, information is transmitted between PCs - either from a remote PC to the office, or across different networks - down an ordinary telephone line using a modem. The problem is that the telephone line, which was designed to transfer voice rather than data, can be an unreliable and slow conduit for sending information from a PC. Now comes the floppy disc transfer machine which will send the entire contents of a 3.5-inch or five-inch floppy disc down the phone line to another disc. In order to transfer the information it is first read by a floppy disc drive. The signals are then compressed so they can be sent down the digital network and decompressed, or expanded, at the other end. Then they are copied on to a disc stored on a receiving machine. Because they involve the transfer of digital signals, floppy disc transfers can only be used where an integrated services digital network (ISDN) is available. In Japan, where 94 per cent of those who use telephones have access to ISDN services, NTT, the former public telecommunications operator, started selling floppy disc transfer machines two years ago. The NTT machines are manufactured by Yamaha. The NTT machines can also be used to copy the contents of discs of different sizes on to each other. NEC, the electronics group, has a similar model. Europe has still some way to go in building up its ISDN infrastructure but in the UK, BT, the telecommunications group, has been making an effort to expand its ISDN network. BT said that it is currently looking at the floppy disc transfer machine on a trial basis. NTT believes that when ISDN is more widely available in Europe, the floppy disc transfer machine will find strong demand. In the US, however, the adoption of different ISDN standards by the Baby Bells makes the system it impossible to use.</p>

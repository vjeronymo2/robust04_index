			<p><P> June 24, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROBERT HILBURN: 'RAINBOW WARRIORS' SMASHES SALES RECORDS IN THE SOVIET UNION  </P> <P> "Rainbow Warriors" was one of the biggest-selling albums of the year even  before it hit the U.S. record shops this week.  </P> <P> That's because the collection -- a two-record compilation featuring previously  released tracks by more than two dozen of today's most prized rock acts -- has  sold 4 million copies in the Soviet Union since it was released there on March  6.  </P> <P> The reason for the phenomenal Soviet sales: "Rainbow Warriors" is a  breakthrough in a country that has been notoriously slow to accept contemporary  rock.  </P> <P> While the collection is still not a total survey of what's happening today in  rock (there's no heavy metal, rap or post-punk), the album does represent the  first time Soviet record stores have carried an album that showcases what might  best be described as "up-to-date rock."  </P> <P> Until now, rock albums -- which have to be released in any quantity through  Melodiya, the government record label -- have either been decade-old  collections by the likes of the Beatles or Moody Blues or the special Paul  McCartney package of '50s rockers.  </P> <P> By contrast, the vinyl and cassette versions of "Rainbow Warriors" offers 27  selections, including such socially conscious works as U2's "Pride (In the Name  of Love)," Peter Gabriel's "Red Rain," Sting's "Love Is the Seventh Wave,"  R.E.M.'s "It's the End of the World As We Know It," Lou Reed's "Last Great  American Whale" and Bruce Hornsby's "Look Out Any Window." In addition, the CD  version contains four additional tracks, including Hothouse Flowers' "Hard  Rain" and Robbie Robertson's "Somewhere Down the Crazy River."  </P> <P> That sales explosion -- another million copies are expected to be sold in the  Soviet Union by Christmas -- is exactly the excitement envisioned by the  album's sponsor, Greenpeace, the international environmental advocacy  organization.  </P> <P> "We always had a lot of rock artists giving donations, but we hadn't actually  approached them for support before," Cornelia Durrant, chairman of Greenpeace  in England and one of the key figures behind the album, said during a recent  interview in London.  </P> <P> "Greenpeace is very keyed to creating our own publicity, so we haven't needed  to use celebrities in the past, but we felt we needed their help this time.  These rock artists are literally worshipped by young people in Russia and we  saw them as our ticket into the country. It was a way to raise funds for the  Greenpeace chapter there and draw attention to our goals."  </P> <P> Besides contributing tracks to the album, various bands -- most notably R.E.M.  on its recent arena tour -- have been allowing Greenpeace volunteers to  distribute informational material at their concerts.  </P> <P> This involvement, in effect, has made Greenpeace the rock community's new  charity of choice, assuming the position held in recent years by Amnesty  International. The latter involvement was climaxed by an unprecedented  five-continent tour featuring Bruce Springsteen, Peter Gabriel and Sting.  </P> <P> Ironically, Durrant said, the rash of rock benefits -- from Live Aid through  the Amnesty tour -- had made Greenpeace wary of turning to the musicians for  support.  </P> <P> "The more people use a particular device or method for promoting issues, the  less effective it becomes over time. People get a bit bored with it. It's like,  'Oh, here come the rock stars again . . . ' and they tune out," she said.  </P> <P> But Ian Flooks, one of England's leading rock agents and the album's executive  producer, said the rock connection was perfect for what the organization wanted  to do in the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> "We wanted to find a way of raising money for Greenpeace outside of any  government influence . . . as many individual donations from as large a number  of people as possible," he said.  </P> <P> "Greenpeace had looked into doing a record a few years ago, but it did not seem  possible. But this time, we found nothing but cooperation on the part of the  Russians. Once we had it approved, we realized there was no reason why we  shouldn't use it in as many countries as possible . . . raising more funds and  raising awareness on a worldwide level. My objective is to make this the first  record ever released in every country in the world."  </P> <P> Sales in most countries aren't expected to match the hot pace of the Soviet  Union figures, but they should be strong -- given the line-up that also  includes such names as Sting, the Grateful Dead, Talking Heads, Simple Minds  and John Cougar Mellencamp. The album was released in the United States by  Geffen Records, and sales are expected to reach the 1 million level.  </P> <P> DRIVIN' N' CRYIN'/LINGERIE -- There's a song ("Honeysuckle Blue") on the new  album by the rock group Drivin' N' Cryin' that is so wonderfully evocative that  it alone was enough reason to check out the Atlanta quartet's appearance  Thursday night at the Lingerie, where it opened for the recently reviewed House  of Freaks. The song is a bittersweet tale of sad regret about lost ideals and  endangered environment that has the fresh breath of a strong, original pop  vision.  </P> <P> But Drivin' N' Cryin' showed little of that distinctive style in the opening  two-thirds of its hour set at the club, serving up instead some undernourished  Led Zeppelin power-rock and some overstated Tom Petty roots-rock.  </P> <P> The colorlessness of the music was underscored when the band, led by  singer-songwriter Kevn Kinney, finally got around to "Honeysuckle Blue" and  followed it with an equally rewarding "Straight to Hell." The latter is a  country-accented story -- reminiscent of the Flying Burrito Brothers in its  sense of naked emotion -- about a young boy being cast aside by his family and  his town.  </P> <P> There is such a gap between these songs and the rest of the band's set that the  band ought to sit down and listen to a tape of the show and see which direction  it wants to follow: the mostly colorless hard rock or the more engaging and  original tone of "Honeysuckle Blue" and "Straight to Hell." If the vote ends up  a tie, count this as an offer to cast the deciding vote.  </P> <P> LIVE ACTION: Elton John will be at the Forum on Aug. 15 and 16. Tickets go on  sale Monday. . . .

			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Stoy Hayward writ over audit STOY HAYWARD, the accountancy firm, has been served with a writ in connection with its audit of Petrocon, the engineering and surveying group now known as Beverley Group. It is being sued in connection with excessive stock and work-in-progress valuations in a subsidiary allegedly not identified by the firm during 1990. The writ was issued at the start of the year and was served in the last few weeks. Mr Paul Hipps, senior partner, said: 'We will contest any claim very vigorously.' Stoy changed its auditor to Solomon Hare for its 1991 audit.</p>

			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Howard ready to retreat over police structure bill Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, is preparing a tactical retreat on one of the most important elements of legislation to overhaul the structure of the police in the hope of defusing opposition in the Lords. Whitehall officials believe that Mr Howard is ready to bow to demands from opponents of the bill that the government drop its proposal that the home secretary appoint the chairman of each police authority. That provision brought a stinging attack last week from a succession of former home secretaries led by Lord Whitelaw, still one of the most influential figures in the Tory establishment. Lord Whitelaw argued that the change would produce a dangerous politicisation of the police. Mr Howard has yet to formalise the government's response, but it is understood that he wants to react quickly rather than allow the issue to drag on. The government's education bill is already stalled in the House of Lords because of strong opposition from - among others - Tory peers. The view in Whitehall is that a decision by Mr Howard to cede the point on the appointment of authority chairman would not undermine the central objective of the legislation - to improve police efficiency. The main elements in meeting that objective are seen instead as the plan to end local authority dominance of police authorities and to give chief constables much greater autonomy in local policing. But it remains uncertain that the tactical retreat now being considered  - and still to be approved by the cabinet - would defuse opposition to other elements of the bill. Lord Taylor, the Lord Chief Justice, last week attacked a separate provision authorising the appointment of new officials to manage the offices of justices' clerks. He said this could threaten the impartiality of magistrates' courts.</p>

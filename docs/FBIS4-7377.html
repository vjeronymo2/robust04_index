			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 27 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today  comes out with an article titled "Our People Proud of Having  Great Leader".    The author of the article says:    Our people have a high national pride and honour as they  have  the great leader in the person of respected Comrade Kim Il-song  peerless in their history of thousands of years.    As they have the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and uphold  his leadership, they become a heroic people who won great  victories in wars against two formidable imperialist enemies and  a proud people who have set an example for the century in  creation and construction.    Their pride in having the great leader has been heightened  as  they are guided by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il today.    As they have respected Supreme Commander General Kim  Chong-il, their pride has reached a lofty height and it serves  as an important ideological and moral source of all their  victories.    Their pride serves as a powerful motive force which enables  our people to courageously advance along the road of socialism  under whatever conditions.    Our people have victoriously advanced the cause of socialism  under the banner of the chuche idea, following the guidance of  the party and the leader. In this course, our people have  become firmly convinced that the road of socialism led by the  great leader and the dear leader is the most correct road and  become proud of building the most advantageous socialism in the  world.    They are successfully building socialism, not wavering under  the complex situation, because of their high pride of having the  great leader.    Their pride also serves as the source of strength which  enables them to demonstrate the dignity and honor of the country  in confrontation with the imperialists.    Today our people are famous as a most proud and dignified  people who resolutely counter any moves of the imperialists and  firmly defend the cause of Korean-style socialism without the  slightest vacillation.    They are countering the imperialists' anti-socialist  campaign  with the conviction that they will win because the great leader  and the dear leader are leading them and with the unshakable  will to build Korean-style socialism better under the guidance  of the party and the leader.</p>

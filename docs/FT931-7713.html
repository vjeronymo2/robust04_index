			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Observer: Gang bust Who are the latest victims of Japan's downturn? Its organised crime gangs, whose decline has been charted with not just typical precision, but apparent orderliness. A survey of police stations around the country shows there are 39,000 gangs, many of them officially registered under the so-called 'anti-gang' law introduced last year. Taken together, they currently have 80,000 employees - 5,000 down on March 1992. What's more, about 132 of the employers have gone out of business. In the meantime, 281 instructions have been issued forbidding gangs to undertake illegal activities such as extortion or preventing their members from quitting. Even so, as the newspaper Yomiuri Shimbum reports in shocked tones, in six cases second warnings had to be given before the gangs took any real notice. Fortunately, many other gangsters gave up like good Japanese citizens, sending the police no fewer than 219 guns. Four in Nara prefecture went further. Such was their depression at their loss of income that they committed suicide.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Caracas, 18 May (DPA) -- In a decision  unprecedented in Venezuela, the Supreme Court decided in a 10 to  four vote today to issue an arrest warrant against former  President Carlos Andres Perez and Alejandro Izaguirre and  Reinaldo Figueredo, ministers during the Perez administration,  on charges of embezzling $17 million from a secret slush fund.    The historic decision, announced by Supreme Court President  Roberto Yepes Boscan, paves the way for a regular trial against  Perez, twice president of Venezuela and former Socialist  International vice president, for embezzlement, presumably  committed at the beginning of his second administration in  February 1989.    In an unexpected move, Perez went to the Supreme Court "to  obey the law" with former Interior Minister Izaguirre. Former  Presidency Secretariat Minister Figueredo is either in the  United States or in the UK, according to his lawyers.    The former president, who is 71, said upon arriving at the  Supreme Court that the order was a "political decision." On 20  May 1993, the Supreme Court separated Perez from the presidency  to begin a "pretrial of merits" for the same case in a judicial  action that is unprecedented in modern Venezuelan history.    The former president was arrested by the Judicial Technical  Police and will be held in El Junquito Jail outside Caracas.  Perez's detention marks another political landmark as he was  elected president on a wave of popularity in 1974 and 1989 and  portrayed himself as a charismatic leader with Third World  connections, heading various international forums for  South-South cooperation.

			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Cable TV group to seek phone licences A GROUP of cable television companies operating throughout the UK is about to apply to the government for a licence to offer personal communications network (PCN) services. Six cable TV investors want to offer mobile services in their areas, the newspaper Communications Week International says. If they are successful, it would be the cable operators' first entry to the mobile communications market, and could lead to increased competition in a mass market for low-cost pocket radio-telephones and related services. The six companies - Comcast, Diamond Cable, General Cable, Nynex, Pacific Telesis and Southwestern Bell - believe their existing networks will enable them to provide mobile services quickly and relatively cheaply. General Cable, a subsidiary of the French water utility Compagnie Generale des Eaux, claims that it could make PCN services available within nine months at competitive prices. The Cable TV Association, which represents the companies, is urging the government to give them the block of radio air space freed last year by the merger of Mercury Personal Communications and Unitel. Existing PCN licence holders Hutchison Telecom, Mercury One-2-One, Vodafone and Cellnet are likely to oppose the granting of the licence, arguing that it is not cost-effective to provide PCNs on a local basis. The Department of Trade and Industry has yet to decide whether to issue new PCN licenses.</p>

Mr.  Maxwell Gaylard said that they had managed to get the two 10-man  delegations from the rival factions within the Royal Lesotho  Defense Force together for a meeting in Maseru. He said he was  optimistic that this was the beginning of a significant  breakthrough, although the Commonwealth still intended to bring  the two sides together for more substantial talks. Troops from  the two factions are still in position in the hills around  Maseru.</p>

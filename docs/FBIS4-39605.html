			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Sergey Zavorotnyy report: "U.S. Hand Has Not Grown Weary </F> of Striking. U.S. Plans for Invasion of Haiti"]    [Text] Buenos Aires -- A specter is haunting Latin  America. The specter of a U.S. military invasion. The head of  the U.S. Administration has dusted it down and set it in train.  Bill Clinton seems to need to show his compatriots and the  world at large that he is a real man and not just an accidental  "occupant" of the White House apartments. How can the United  States claim to rule the world if it cannot cope with the  insolent Haitian dictator General Raul Cedras, who is refusing  under any circumstances to return power to Haiti's legally  elected president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide?    Pentagon specialists have already elaborated a plan for the  occupation of Haiti. It is envisaged that the U.S. Marines  would land first and carry out "surgical" strikes on and  neutralize the Haitian Army. Having performed their mission,  the Americans would leave and their place would be taken by  inter-American forces created on the basis of contingents from  the Latin American armies. Flying the flag of the United  Nations and the OAS, they would be responsible for the main task  of keeping the peace on Haiti and ensuring cooperation between  the president as he returns to the country by foreign force of  arms and the local bureaucracy.    Exiled President Aristide has long advocated the U.S. plan.  Senor Caputo, UN and OAS representative on Haiti, is in favor of  the invasion. But what about the Latin American countries?  Will they agree to pull Washington's chestnuts out of the fire?  At the moment only one country -- Argentina -- has given its  assent. Its President Carlos Menem has long hankered after  exploits in the Caribbean in company with Washington. An  Argentine frigate is already off the coast of Haiti. The other  states in Latin America still remember former U.S. expeditions  to Grenada (1983) and Panama (1989). Following the U.S.  occupation of Grenada little changed there. Poverty and  corruption in the top echelons of power are still the most  striking feature of the incumbent democratic regime. The  Americans promised Panama they would liberate it from the  domination of the international drugs mafia. Some 4,000  civilian lives were sacrificed to these promises. However,  General Noriega has long been in jail yet Panama still remains a  paradise for the drug barons' operations.    But who remembers that today when the occupation of Grenada  boosted Reagan's popularity and the Panama operation turned Bush  into one of the most popular of U.S. presidents? Today others'  laurels are giving Clinton no peace.</p>

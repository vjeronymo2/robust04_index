			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / Publisher shares his wealth at the office Mr Peter Kindersley, founder and chairman of the illustrated books publisher Dorling Kindersley, is a passionate advocate of employee share ownership. Yesterday he put more than Pounds 2.6m of his own money where his mouth is. Mr Kindersley said he would make 950,000 of his shares - 1.5 per cent of the company - available to executives in a private share option incentive scheme. Some 20 executives will benefit from the windfall gift, as long as they remain with Dorling Kindersley until September 30 1996 and March 29 1997. The executives, only three of whom are on the main board, will have an option to buy the shares at 16p - the price at which executives were offered options just before the company came to the market at the end of 1992 - against last night's close of 292p. The largest beneficiary will be entitled to 175,000 shares. If all the options are taken up, Mr Kindersley will receive a total payment of Pounds 152,000 for the shares, more than Pounds 2.6m less than yesterday's market value. He will still have a 40.1 per cent stake, worth Pounds 72m. He denied yesterday that the gesture was remarkable, preferring to emphasise the future benefits he expected to accrue to the company - and to his own reduced stake. 'I hope in time I will not feel this at all,' he said. Mr Kindersley attacked the limitations imposed on option schemes by UK institutional shareholders. 'In the US institutions realise the importance of motivating staff. Here, the reaction is that it is some sort of dilution,' he said. This way, institutions would not suffer and, he believed, eventually his own holding would be enhanced. One executive who will benefit from Mr Kindersley's unorthodox gesture said institutions should be grateful. 'They probably owe Peter a drink for taking this on himself,' he said. The Covent Garden-based company is a pioneer in the multimedia field. It produces illustrated reference books and futuristic multimedia products, which use CD and computer technology to combine text, images and sound. The company's books are conceived from the outset as an integral combination of images and words, with captions wrapped round high quality photographs and graphics, printed on clear white backgrounds. Microsoft, the US computer software group, holds a 20 per cent stake in Dorling Kindersley. Last year, the chief executive of a computer games distributor, Centregold, gave his managing director shares worth Pounds 330,000.</p>

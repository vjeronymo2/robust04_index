			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Party rallies to back Rao in MPs' vote MR P V Narasimha Rao, the Indian prime minister, last night looked likely to survive a parliamentary no-confidence motion today over his government's handling of the Ayodhya mosque crisis. The ruling Congress (I) party and its smaller allies seemed set to rally around the prime minister to defeat a motion proposed by the right-wing Hindu Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), the main opposition party. The BJP organised a rally at which Hindu militants destroyed the mosque in Ayodhya and provoked a nationwide wave of violence. However, despite the public show of loyalty, many Congress party MPs harbour serious doubts about supporting Mr Rao as prime minister. They feel some of the criticisms of the government's role before and after the storming of the mosque on December 6 have hit home. Some believe the party may have to call a general election next year to restore its damaged credibility. With the BJP defiant, India could face a prolonged political fight over Ayodhya. The uncertainty clouds the outlook for Mr Rao's widely praised economic liberalisation programme, which has drawn much of its force from the single-mindedness of his cabinet and its senior advisers. Any hope that the crisis might be settled quickly has evaporated with a government decision to impose central rule on three BJP-ruled states - Rajastan, Madhya Pradesh, and Himachal Pradesh. Mr Rao had earlier won praise for dismissing the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh, which includes Ayodhya. But this week's move has been condemned by commentators as unconstitutional. If he sits tight and tries to ride out the crisis by doing as little as possible, he will alienate hardliners in his own party who want him to go all out in attacking the BJP. Moslems, who have traditionally supported Congress, also want firm action. However, the strong use of government power runs the risk of provoking sympathy for the BJP. Even Indians who have no time for the BJP are very wary of the government imposing central rule - because of the memories it evokes of repressive acts carried out during Mrs Indira Gandhi's period of central government rule in the 'emergency' of the 1970s. The loss of support from newspapers is significant because most of the press has supported economic reform. India's Supreme Court yesterday reinstated an investigation into allegations of corruption over a Dollars 1.3bn (Pounds 855m) artillery deal with the Swedish company Bofors, Reuter adds. It delivered final judgment on a government appeal against a lower court order in September which ended the investigation into the 1986 deal on the grounds that no charges had been brought despite the lengthy probe.</p>

			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / World Trade News: French and German power groups plan joint ventures FRENCH and German electricity companies intend to form joint ventures to build and manage new power stations in east Germany and France. Bayernwerk, one of the German companies, said it would combine with Preussen Elektra (part of the Veba group) and RWE to set up two ventures with state-owned Electricite de France (EdF). No financial details were available, but the German side will have the majority stake in the east German projects and EdF in the French ones. The power plants to be built for and operated by these companies would have a capacity of 2,000MW each. In east Germany, they will probably be conventional plants based on imported coal. Nuclear plants could be built in France, where these are less controversial than in Germany. The German companies had previously wanted to take a 15 per cent stake in EdF in return for a holding of the same size by EdF in Veag, the new east German utility. But France declined to cut its stake in EdF. The new agreement provides a way round this obstacle. Preussen Elektra, RWE, and Bayernwerk, in which the Viag industrial group owns 39 per cent and the state of Bavaria 59 per cent, will acquire 75 per cent of Veag when it is privatised by the Treuhand agency later this year.</p>

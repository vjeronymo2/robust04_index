			<p><P> October 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOYOTA WILL DOUBLE IMPORTS TO JAPAN OF ITS U.S.-BUILT CARS  </P> <P> In an apparent effort to help reduce trade friction between Japan and the  United States, Toyota plans to more than double its imports of U.S.-built cars  and other products into Japan over the next three years, the company said  Monday.  </P> <P> Toyota, Japan's largest auto maker, said that by 1992, its imports of American  products into Japan will total $2.1 billion, up from $1 billion in 1989.  </P> <P> Toyota said it will ship up to 40,000 U.S.-built cars a year from its new  American assembly operations back to Japan by the early 1990s. The cars, to be  produced at Toyota's new Georgetown, Ky., assembly plant, will be Camry compact  models equipped with right-hand drive, which is standard in Japan.  </P> <P> In addition, Toyota said that, beginning next year, it will export 600,000  catalytic converters for use in its Japanese-built cars from its highly  automated factory in Long Beach; by 1992, those exports will rise to 750,000  annually. Also in 1992, the company will begin exporting 100,000 engines a year  to Japan, from a new engine plant in Kentucky.  </P> <P> The actions mark a major change for Toyota, which was initially more reluctant  than other Japanese auto makers to commit to building cars in the United  States. Traditionally, Toyota has produced virtually all of its cars and parts  in Japan, with most of its manufacturing operations concentrated around its  Toyota City headquarters.  </P> <P> Now, however, Toyota officials say the firm is taking a more global outlook.  </P> <P> "We are at the stage now with our overseas operations, particularly in the  U.S., where we can begin to experiment with model sharing, and parts and  component sourcing on a more global level," said Toyota Executive Vice  President Tsutomu Ohshima. "This is our first real step, and we expect there  will be others to follow."  </P> <P> To expand its purchases of American parts, the company said it will spend $144  million on its U.S. research and development activities, tripling the size of  its Ann Arbor, Mich., technical center, and adding a new technical headquarters  in Torrance, near the headquarters of its U.S. sales and marketing operations.  </P> <P> Toyota said one of the main functions of the expanded technical staff will be  to evaluate American parts suppliers and parts, which the firm said its U.S.  operations have not been equipped to do in the past.  </P> <P> Among its first major purchases have been U.S.-built machine tools, according  to a report in an industry trade journal. Toyota has become the first Japanese  auto maker producing cars in this country to buy tooling and equipment for its  new U.S. factory from American machine tool makers, Metalworking News reported  Monday.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Toyota officials have also visited nine U.S. semiconductor makers as  part of an effort to increase the company's use of American computer chips in  its cars. On Monday, the company said it plans a "sevenfold" increase in its  use of American chips by 1992.  </P> <P> Toyota is not the first Japanese company to export U.S.-built cars back to  Japan, however.  </P> <P> Honda currently ships 6,000 Accord Coupes a year from its Marysville, Ohio,  assembly plant to Japan and plans to increase those exports to 50,000 a year by  the early 1990s. A proposed Accord station wagon, which is to be built only in  Marysville -- and not Japan -- beginning in 1991, is also considered a likely  candidate for export back to Japan, company officials say.  </P> <P> The Ford Probe, which is built by Mazda in the company's Flat Rock, Mich.,  assembly plant, is also exported to Japan. Exports of the new Mitsubishi  Eclipse, produced by Diamond-Star Motors, a joint venture between Chrysler and  Mitsubishi in Bloomington, Ill., will begin in December.  </P> <P> In order to avert strict limits on direct Japanese imports into Taiwan, several  Japanese operations here have also begun shipping cars to Taiwan. Toyota  currently exports Camrys from Kentucky and Corolla subcompact models from its  joint venture with General Motors for the Taiwanese market. Toyota said Monday  that it will increase shipments of U.S.-built Camrys to Taiwan from 4,000 a  year to 10,000 annually by 1992.  </P> <P> Toyota also announced several smaller purchases of American products. Most  notably, it said it is buying a second U.S.-made supercomputer for use in its  engineering and design offices in Japan from Minneapolis-based Cray Research.  </P></p>

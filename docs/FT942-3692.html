			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections '94: Voters keep faith in ruling coalition - Luxembourg European elections coincided with national legislative polls in the grand Duchy of Luxembourg. Its 225,000 voters showed their faith in the ruling coalition of Christian Socialist and Socialist parties which has been in power since 1984, by returning them virtually intact. Mr Jacques Santer, the prime minister and leader of the Christian Socialists, lost one seat to take 21 of the total seats of 60. The Socialists lost one seat to win 17. Mr Santer is expected once again to choose the Socialists as partners in government. The main opposition party - the liberal Democratic party - gained one more seat to take a total of 12. For the Strasbourg elections, Mr Santer's party lost one seat to hold only two of Luxembourg's generous allocation of six. This seat passed for the first time to the Greens, whose leader, Mr Jup Weber, burst into tears. The win came as a genuine surprise to the Luxembourgois who had been expecting the Greens to follow trends elsewhere in Europe and lose ground. But Mr Weber appears to have benefited from concerns over the opening of an industrial waste plant on the Belgian border and the extensive construction of motorways across the country.  ------------------------------------------- Population: 0.4m Seats: 6  ------------------------------------------- Results (Turnout 90.0%; 1989, 87.4%)  ------------------------------------------- Party*      Parliament    % vote      Seats               group     '94   '89  '94   '89  ------------------------------------------- CSV            EPP     31.4  34.9    2     3 LSAP           PES     24.8  25.4    2     2 DP             LDR     18.8  20.0    1     1 Greens      Greens     10.9     -    1     -  ------------------------------------------- Source: AFP estimates at 02.00 GMT yesterday  ------------------------------------------- *Abbreviations: CSV = Christian Social People's party; DP = Democratic party; LSAP = Socialist Workers' party  ------------------------------------------- Parliamentary group abbreviations: see bottom front page this section  ------------------------------------------- Electoral system:  ------------------------------------------- Proportional from national lists Compulsory voting:  Yes  -------------------------------------------                    MEPs  ------------------------------------------- LSAP Jacques Poos, Mady Delvaux-Stehres  ------------------------------------------- DP Lydie Wulth Polfer  ------------------------------------------- CSV Jean-Claude Juncker, Jacques Santer  ------------------------------------------- Greens Jup Weber  -------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / FT Law Report: No Mareva for bank collection LEWIS &amp; PEAT (PRODUCE) LTD AND OTHERS v ALMATU PROPERTIES LTD AND OTHERS Court of Appeal (Lord Justice Parker, Lord Justice Stuart-Smith and Lord Justice Beldam): May 7 1992 MONEY IN the hands of a bank, collected by it as agent for another bank in exchange for bills of lading deposited by an exporter under an agreement by which export proceeds are to be credited to his revolving overdraft account, cannot be frozen by Mareva injunction in execution of judgment against him, in that it is not his property but is a payment to the principal bank entitling it to credit it to his account towards reduction of the overdraft. The Court of Appeal so held when dismissing an appeal by the plaintiffs, Lewis &amp; Peat (Produce) Ltd and others, from Mr Justice Gatehouse's decision discharging injunctions restraining the respondent, Midland Bank plc, from dealing with collected monies pending execution of judgment in an action against Almatu Properties Ltd and others. LORD JUSTICE PARKER said that on March 13 1991, Lewis &amp; Peat obtained judgment against three defendants one of whom was a Mr Musa K Suma, for a total of Dollars 1m. They had been making urgent and energetic attempts to execute judgment by a combination of garnishee proceedings against various persons and Mareva injunctions. Those attempts resulted in court orders which included a garnishee order nisi against Midland, and injunctions restraining Midland from dealing with the proceeds of sale of two cargoes of cocoa and coffee beans, after collection of those proceeds by Midland. On June 20 1991, Mr Justice Gatehouse set aside the garnishee proceedings and discharged the injunctions against Midland. He declared Midland was free to deal with the proceeds of sale in accordance with the instructions of its customer, the National Development Bank of Sierra Leone (NDB); and that NDB was free to give such instructions as it might see fit, including instructions to transfer the monies out of the jurisdiction. Lewis &amp; Peat sought to set aside discharge of the injunctions, and the declaration. It was common ground that for the purposes of the appeal Mr Suma and Techprofit and Sumatu, two companies in Sierra Leone owned and controlled by him, were regarded as being in effect Mr Suma. On November 12 1990, NDB granted Sumatu an overdraft facility of 32m Leones (Pounds 43,578) for 12 months. The terms and conditions of the facility were that it should be on the revolving basis and that Sumatu would export all produce through NDB; and that the counter-value of the export proceeds in foreign exchange would be credited to Sumatu's account with NDB. On February 1 1991, Lewis &amp; Peat obtained an injunction against Mr Suma restraining him from exporting or dealing with coffee and cocoa. As a result, NDB wrote to Sumatu on March 15 calling for payment of the account. On April 2, the two cargoes were shipped at Freetown, Sierra Leone. On April 5, Techprofit sent NDB a full set of shipping documents for each cargo with instructions to forward them to the buyer, Tagville Ltd, in exchange for Pounds 77,360 for the cocoa cargo and Pounds 104,369 for the coffee cargo, and on receipt of the export proceeds to credit Sumatu's account with NDB. On the same day, NDB sent the documents to Midland 'for collection of the proceeds from Tagville Ltd'. The documents and covering letters were received by Midland on April 8. But for the intervention of Lewis &amp; Peat, those two routine documentary collections would have proceeded in the ordinary way. Midland would have collected the monies, credited them to NDB's current account and informed NDB. NDB would then, in accordance with instructions, have credited them to Sumatu's account in reduction or extinction of the overdraft. As a result of Lewis &amp; Peat's intervention, operations had been held up. The collections had been made but had been credited to a separate interest-bearing account in NDB's name and frozen there by the orders which were discharged by Mr Justice Gatehouse. They were still frozen pending the present appeal. The issues on the appeal were: (1) whether the sale proceeds were to be regarded in Midland's hands as an asset held on trust for or a debt due to Techprofit, or were simply a debt due to NDB; (2) whether the courts should treat documentary collections like bills of exchange or letters of credit as obligations to which the Mareva jurisdiction had no application, for the reasons given by Lord Justice Kerr in Z v A-Z (1982) QB 558; (3) whether the principle in (2) applied even to injunctions in aid of execution. Mr Page for Lewis &amp; Peat submitted that the answer to question (1) was that the proceeds should be regarded as belonging to, or as a debt due to, Techprofit/Sumatu/Suma, and that the answers to questions (2) and (3) should be 'no'. The House of Lords decision in Mackersy v Ramsay (1843) 9 Cl &amp; F 818,844 presented Mr Page with insuperable difficulty. The facts appeared from Lord Campbell's speech. He said Ramsay &amp; Co, as bankers, were employed by a customer to obtain payment of a bill of exchange drawn on a person in Calcutta, payable to their order. They were to receive payment of it for Mackersy, having a lien on the bill and its proceeds for any balance due to them from him. Payment was to be made to persons to be employed by them, to whom the bill must be endorsed. Mackersy was not to interfere with the proceeds of the bill until he was credited. Ramsay &amp; Co employed as its agent Coutts &amp; Co, which o employed Alexander &amp; Co, which duly received payment from the acceptor and, having given Coutts credit in account, five months later became bankrupt. Lord Campbell said: 'I conceive that these circumstances amount in point of law to a payment to Ramsay &amp; Co, and that they were bound to place the amount to the credit of Mackersy.' The document there to be collected was a bill of exchange whereas the present case was concerned with bills of lading and other shipping documents, but that was not a relevant distinction. The factual situation was the same, save that here two rather than three banks were involved. The documents, having been lodged with NDB for collection, passed out of the control of Techprofit/Sumatu/Suma, and NDB had a lien on them to the extent at least of Sumatu's overdraft. NDB then sent the documents to Midland for collection. As soon as collection was made, it was to be regarded as payment to NDB by Midland. NDB's customer, Sumatu, then became entitled to a credit in the amount of the collection. That credit might or might not result in a debt due to Sumatu by NDB, depending on the state of Sumatu's account and any other arrangements between Sumatu and NDB, but those matters were of no concern to Midland whose obligations were to NDB and no-one else. If in the result a debt did become due to Sumatu, that debt would be situated in Sierra Leone and not in the UK. There was no basis on which it could be successfully contended that the proceeds of the collections were the property in the UK of Techprofit, Sumatu or Suma, or constituted a debt owed to any of them by Midland. In the light of the above, issues (2) and (3) did not strictly arise, but the answer to both questions was 'yes', save in very exceptional circumstances. It was of the first importance that routine banking transactions such as these should not be subject to interference by the Mareva jurisdiction, unless an exceptionally strong case could be made out that for some reason or another the well-settled principles of banking law were inapplicable. The appeal was dismissed. Lord Justice Beldam gave a concurring judgment. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith agreed. For Lewis &amp; Peat: Hugo Page (Clifford Chance). For Midland Bank: Richard Siberry QC and J Smouha (Stephenson Harwood).</p>

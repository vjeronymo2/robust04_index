			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Markets: Clinton's close shave saves face all round - Wall Street his deficit reduction programme squeaked through the House of Representatives on Thursday night - and Wall Street, whatever its own political views on the new administration's economic policies, breathed a sigh of relief. Although the recent troubles that have afflicted Clinton - including the embarrassing episode of the expensive haircut on Air Force One, and the fiasco over the changes at the White House travel office - have mostly been ignored by the financial markets, the suggestion that the president's first Budget might be rejected by Congress genuinely unnerved investors. Again, this was not necessarily a reflection of their enthusiasm for Clinton's economic proposals, but more a pragmatic realisation that a big defeat for the president so early in his term could be devastating politically. Whether they are Democrats or Republicans, the financial markets like their presidents to have a firm grip on economic policy. Concern about the situation at the White House reached the point this week where one leading newspaper questioned whether the country was about to be lumbered with another failed presidency. Thus, the news that Clinton's tax-raising, deficit-reduction plan had passed (but only just) its first big hurdle in Congress reassured investors. Although the vote came too late to affect trading, bond and stock prices had risen on Wednesday and Thursday in anticipation that the House would vote in favour. The bond market, in particular, drew comfort from the late revival in Clinton's fortunes for, only a week earlier, it had seemed a very distinct possibility that the vote would go against him. This worried Treasury investors who felt that the president's proposals, despite their flaws, were - at the very least - the first meaningful attempt by any recent government to tackle the huge federal deficit. If Clinton had been defeated in the House, fixed-income investors believed that they would have faced years of rising deficits and interest rates, too. The stock markets, although less enamoured of the specific policies in the plan - the big tax increases the government proposes to levy on wealthier individuals and most corporations are especially unpopular among equity investors - took their cue from the bond market. The decline in the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond to below 7 per cent buoyed stocks, lifting the Dow Jones Industrial Average to two consecutive record highs: 3,540.16 on Wednesday and 3,554.83 on Thursday. The fact that the Dow promptly turned tail yesterday (by mid-morning it was down about 20 points) did not suggest that the markets suddenly had reversed their position on the president's plan. It just proved that dealers and investors still like to buy on the rumour and sell on the fact. Or, perhaps, the markets simply were preparing for the next battle - the vote in the Senate, which political pundits predict will be a tougher task for the president and his congressional allies. The drama of the vote in the House at least diverted investors' attention away from the still-thorny question of whether the Federal Reserve is preparing to raise interest rates to curb inflation. Several reports this week suggested that the Fed's open market committee, which meets in Washington every six weeks to review monetary policy, voted unanimously at its meeting 10 days ago to shift the emphasis of policy towards a tightening of domestic credit conditions. Although the reports unsettled fixed-income prices at the short end of the Treasury market, they were ignored by investors in stocks and long-term government securities. The reason probably was that if there is a consensus in the financial markets about the economic outlook, it is that growth will remain sluggish and inflation weak for the rest of the year. Yesterday's downward revision in estimates of first-quarter gross domestic product growth - from a previously reported 1.8 per cent to a new estimate of 0.9 per cent - confirmed that the economic recovery has been anything but robust so far this year. There are still plenty of economists who believe that if the Fed does make a move on monetary policy soon, it is more likely to cut interest rates rather than raise them. No less of a name than Henry Kaufman - the former Salomon Brothers' economist who earned fame and fortune in the 1980s successfully predicting the course of interest rates and bond prices, and who now runs his own Wall Street consultancy - forecast this week that the Fed will ease policy this summer to boost the faltering economy.  -------------------------- Monday    3507.78 + 14.96 Tuesday   3516.63 +  8.85 Wednesday 3540.16 + 23.53 Thursday  3554.83 + 14.67 Friday    3527.43 - 27.40  --------------------------</p>

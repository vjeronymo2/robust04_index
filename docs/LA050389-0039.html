			<p><P> May 3, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SPORTS ET CETERA: CHARGERS SIGN SEVEN FREE AGENTS, INCLUDING NEW QUARTERBACK'S  FAVORITE RECEIVER  </P> <P> The Chargers announced the signing of seven free agents Tuesday, including wide  receiver Wayne Walker, who was Billy Joe Tolliver's prime target at Texas Tech  last year. The Chargers selected quarterback Tolliver in the second round of  the April 23 NFL draft.  </P> <P> Walker caught 100 passes for a Texas Tech record 2,007 yards in three years.  </P> <P> Among the other six free agents signed was safety Shawn Hicks, formerly of  Kearny High School and Chico State.  </P> <P> The other five: safety Michael Brooks of North Carolina State, tight end Craig  Davis of Southern University, USC linebacker John Moore, inside linebacker Bob  Sebring of Illinois and defensive end Ed Washington. The Chargers listed no  college for Washington, who played three seasons with the Los Angeles Express  of the defunct USFL.  </P> <P> BASEBALL  </P> <P> Point Loma Nazarene College dropped a Golden State Athletic Conference  doubleheader to visiting California Lutheran, 6-2 and 7-5. Cal Lutheran scored  two runs in the 10th inning to win the nightcap. Cal Lutheran is now 29-15 and  15-7; Point Loma Nazarene dropped to 20-26 and 8-16.  </P> <P> Of the nine runs scored in University of San Diego's 7-2 victory over UCSD,  only one was earned -- and even that came in on a passed ball. USD's Paul  Thornton scored on the fifth-inning passed ball and when batter Andy Roberts  later singled, the run was considered as earned. Roberts finished with three  hits and two RBIs. UCSD's Gene Northway also had three hits.  </P> <P> MEN'S TENNIS  </P> <P> San Diego State lost to Utah, 5-1, in the semifinals of the Western Athletic  Conference tournament in Albuquerque, N.M. Tole Marinkovic was SDSU's lone  winner, defeating Brendan Bowyer, 6-3, 3-6, 7-6, at No. 2 singles. The Aztecs  will play Air Force today for third place.  </P> <P> MEN'S BASKETBALL  </P> <P> Kelvin Means, a sophomore guard for the University of San Diego, has decided to  transfer to to another school to play football. He said he most likely will go  to Fresno State.  </P> <P> Means (6-feet, 170 pounds) was an All-State receiver his senior year at St.  John Bosco High in Bellflower. Bosco went 13-1 that year, the only loss coming  to Crespi High in the Big 5 Conference championship game.  </P> <P> Means will have three years of eligibility in football.  </P> <P> "It was a tough decision out of high school whether to play football or  basketball," Means said. "I chose basketball, but football never left my mind.  If I was going to try it, I had to do it now."  </P> <P> Means chose Fresno State because he was heavily recruited by the university out  of high school.  </P> <P> "When we recruited him, I knew he was more talented as a football player than a  basketball player," said Hank Egan, USD coach. "I was surprised he chose  basketball, but I was also surprised when he came and told me (a month ago) he  wanted to leave."  </P> <P> This season Means started 15 of 28 games and averaged 2.3 points and 1.3  rebounds for the Toreros.  </P></p>

			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / International Company News: TNT debt rating upgraded by S&amp;P Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, yesterday upgraded its senior debt rating for TNT, the Australian transportation group, from B to B+, writes Nikki Tait. S&amp;P, which had indicated such a move was being considered, said that 'as a result of management's financial restructuring, the overall debt burden was now more manageable, with improving discretionary cashflow and liquid balances expected to meet debt maturities'. It made the move after TNT completed a USDollars 100m senior debt offering. TNT, which has been bedevilled by a heavy debt burden and boardroom upheaval last year, has also raised funds by a converting preference share issue and the sale of various 'non-core' assets.</p>

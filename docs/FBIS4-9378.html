			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zoran Petrov: "Are the Detectives `Suffocating' </F> the Interior Ministry?"]    [Text] The fate of the Security College is still  uncertain. Although it has existed for 17 years, the Security  College, according to the Ministry of Internal Affairs,  represents a limit on the admission of college-educated people  into the police, except for detectives, who are narrowly focused  personnel without "horizontal" mobility to other parts of the  state administration. People at the Security College are asking  whether hastily trained lawyers or economists can fight  crime.    The Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia--FYROM] Assembly's meeting three days ago, when the  "Proposal to Adopt a Law on Establishing a Training Center for  Personnel in the Field of Security" came on the agenda, revived  once again the dispute that has existed for almost a year  between the Interior Ministry and representatives of the present  Security College. The basic dilemma, which is also extremely  debatable for a considerable number of parliamentarians (at  least according to their statements at the meeting) is whether  the Security College, which has existed since 1977, should be  abolished, since the most fundamental innovation in the  government's proposal is the elimination of this college and the  establishment of a Center, whose basic task would be to create  personnel for the uniformed portion of the police (the present  police secondary school). The Assembly epilogue of the draft  offered is well-known: By a majority of votes, the deputies  decided that the law would be handled in two phases, with the  government charged with preparing a bill.  <H5>  Invasion of the Police by Unemployed Lawyers </H5>   The Assembly debate revived the dispute begun somewhat less  than a year ago, with the notification by Minister Ljubomir  Frckovski, sent to the Security College, which suspended the  enrollment of students for the upcoming (1993) academic year.  Several months later, on 18 June, Agis Sajnoski, then dean of  the college, convened a news conference at which he called the  Interior Minister's decision to suspend the enrollment of  students an arbitrary action, behind which lay the interests of  a group of professors at the Law College, well deployed in the  government, the University's rector, and the ministers of  internal affairs and education, whose intentions were to wipe  out the education of detectives in order to create room for the  employment of lawyers in the Interior Ministry, which has  recently been done intensively. Interior Minister Ljubomir  Frckovski responded that the reactions by the group of  professors from the Security College were an attempt to attract  public attention by staging "street fights," although in doing  so they did not have the support of a single competent  institution. "On the whole, one can understand their reaction,"  Frckovski said then, "which is due to fear for their own jobs  and the high salaries that professors have."    In the meantime, the Macedonian Government completed the  procedure for preparing a new draft on the transformation of the  present Center (without the college), which was reviewed this  fall by four Assembly commissions, and three days ago at the  Macedonian parliament's meeting. What are the differences  between the two opposing sides, and what are the arguments "for"  and "against" eliminating the Security College, since it is more  than clear that this is actually the most fundamental change in  the government draft that was offered?    The explanation of the Proposal to Adopt a Law on  Establishing a Training Center for Personnel in the Field of  Security, for example, says that for almost 15 years the  Interior Ministry, in its personnel policy, focused on the  admission of "detective" personnel from the Security College,  which exists within the framework of the Center. This kind of  personnel orientation, the explanation then says, represents a  limitation, and restricts the admission of college-educated  people with other professional backgrounds, since these are  narrowly specialized personnel, without "horizontal" mobility  into other parts of the state administration. It then says that  experiences with the quality and adjustment of personnel to work  in the Ministry are in favor of employees with ordinary highly  professional training--lawyers, economists, computer scientists,  sociologists, chemists, and so forth. What still remain  extremely controversial are the way in which this college was  even founded--imposed on the Republic of Macedonia for the needs  of the former SFRY [Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]  internal affairs authorities--the method and selection of  personnel for the needs of a completely different system, which  could by no means be described as democratic. At the same time,  the explanation of the Proposal to Adopt a Law says, several  meetings were held with representatives of the Ministry of  Education, the Ministry of Science, the Cyril and Methodius  University, and the Center, at which there were discussions of  these issues, and in which agreement was reached in principle on  the transformation project, with which only the Security  College's representatives did not agree.  <H5>  Conflict of Conceptual Differences </H5>   In contrast to the position of the government and the  Interior Ministry, the current dean of the Security College, Dr.  Ivanco Stojanov, has a completely different view of things. "Our  college is a member of the Cyril and Methodius University,"  Stojanov said, "and it cannot be abolished without a decision by  the University Council. Accordingly, the position stated in the  explanation of the draft, that meetings were held at the  University and that some sort of agreement on abolishing the  college was reached, does not correspond to the truth. On the  contrary," as Stojanov emphasized, "criminology is a special  science, and differs from the legal, economic, and other  sciences, and consequently a criminal scientist is in a  different profession. The fact is that crime itself is a complex  phenomenon, and only a suitably trained individual can cope with  it, who will be able to cope with the primary  function--preventing, detecting, clarifying, and proving crime.  Can that be done by a hastily trained person, and can he be  equipped by a course several months long to perform these  things?" Stojanov asked.    "I maintain that during the last three years the Interior  Ministry has hired about 1,000 graduate criminal scientists, but  three or four times more lawyers," the dean of the Security  College emphasized. According to him, this has radically  violated the criterion of professionalism or competence, since  it is impossible for people with different professional  qualifications to conduct the police's basic activity. "And as  for the claim that personnel from this college have proven to be  of poor quality and unable to adapt," Stojanov stated  categorically, "let someone tell me where the present chiefs of  the Interior Ministry's regional units came from, the direct of  the Center for Training Security Personnel, and several managers  in the police services and sectors. If they are poor-quality  personnel, then why are they assigned to management positions?"  our interlocutor asked. The main argument for the special status  of the Security College, according to its dean, is its very  curriculum, which consists of 24 subjects, which are not studied  at any other college in the University. Among others, they are:  detective tactics, social pathology, criminal psychology,  special physical education, the basics of security science,  detective techniques, detective methodology, police tactics,  forensic medicine, transportation criminal science, the  criminology of unconstitutional acts, the methodology for  investigating crime, victimology, the statistics of crime,  ecological criminal science, criminological information science,  economic criminal science, and so forth.    From what has been stated above, it can be seen clearly that  there are substantive conceptual differences over the (lack of)  justification for the continued survival of the Security  College. On one hand, the Interior Ministry's position is that  in the spirit of the new times and the role of the police,  narrowly focused and "horizontally" immobile personnel are not  needed, but rather more narrowly specialized individuals from  several scientific areas and disciplines. The college's  position, on the contrary, is that the basic activity of a  detective cannot be conducted by lawyers, economists, or  chemists, since they are trained for other fields. In other  words, a specific problem like crime inevitably requires expert  personnel who would be able to oppose it successfully. Whatever  the case, the Republic of Macedonia's Assembly will have the  last word. The latest news associated with this issue is the  announcement by the Interior Minister that the enrollment of  students at the Security College has been frozen for this year  as well.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] New Delhi, Dec 9--The national environment tribunal  bill, 1992 has been amended, taking away the power of the  Central government to exempt any undertaking or corporation,  owned or controlled by the state or Central governments, from  the liability of damages in case of a mishap in their premises.    This has been done by dropping clause 4 of the original bill  on the recommendation of the department-related parliamentary  standing committee on science &amp; technology, environment and  forests. The report of the committee was presented to the Rajya  Sabha yesterday.    The committee also added a new sub-clause, aimed at  empowering the national environment tribunal to take up claim  cases for compensation suo moto.    The committee has observed that though the title of the bill  conveys an impression that it is very comprehensive and covers  all cases of liability and compensation arising due to  environmental damage or pollution, whatever be its cause, its  scope is actually restricted to cases concerning the protection  of environment and payment of compensation for damage to  persons, property and the environment while handling hazardous  substances.    ``The committee strongly feels that the government may  seriously think of enlarging the scope of the bill by including  cases of compensation for damages which are caused even by such  substances as have not been identified as hazardous by the  ministry of environment and forests...,'' the report says.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Otmar Lahodynsky: "Final Spurt to Agriculture"] </F>   [Text] Brussels -- The European Union [EU] membership  negotiations will be continued on 21 January. Solutions  regarding car component suppliers and the brandy monopoly are in  the offing. Then the final spurt will begin.    Up to four more chapters can be settled in a new round of  negotiations at the level of ambassadors on 21 January. Thus 17  of 29 chapters would be checked off for Austria. Once agreement  is achieved in the areas of competition, free trade in services,  the customs union, and foreign trade, "we will have our hands  free for the political finish," said Austria's EU Ambassador,  Manfred Scheich.    In the next round at ministerial level on 8 February, "the  course must be set for solutions" to the important issues of  transit traffic, second homes, and agriculture, said Scheich.    A solution was found to the problem of Austrian supplies for  the Japanese automobile sector, which are coupled to import  quota. The EU Commission is ready to consider this traditional  agreement between Vienna and Tokyo in the scope of its annual  negotiations with Japan on import quotas for private cars for  the whole of the European Union. In the area of competition,  after the three-year transition period for the tobacco monopoly,  a one-year transition period has now also been agreed upon for  the brandy monopoly which must be abolished in the sales area.    Agriculture is the largest hurdle in the final heated phase  of the membership negotiations, which are to be concluded by  March. Until recently, Vienna did not have a clear position on  the EU proposal that as soon as Austria is a member, it will  have to reduce farm prices, and that at the same time,  compensation will be paid for the farmers through direct income  subsidies. The new "single market model," which is now being  discussed among EU member states, no longer envisages price  adjustments of several years -- as was the case in the past when  new members were admitted -- by "membership compensation  payments" being collected for imports and exports of  agricultural products at the borders.    In Vienna, the option was examined to carry out this system  of price adjustment levies (on imports) and refunds (on exports)  without border checks, which is preferred by farmers'  representatives, by way of using trade statistics at home. This  would mean, however, that during a transition period of several  years, Austria's consumers would have to continue to pay higher  food prices than are paid in the other EU member states.    The European Union wants to see the losses of Austrian  farmers compensated for by direct income subsidies. It is not  yet clear who is supposed to pay.    Meanwhile, EU Council Chairman Theodoros Pangalos has said  he  does not rule out different membership dates for Austria,  Finland, Sweden, and Norway. According to Pangalos, the  European Union, who has also received membership applications  from Cyprus and Malta, will presumably begin negotiations with  Cyprus on 1 January 1995.</p>

The dictionary -- a comprehensive collection of entries of  terms, terminologies, inferences, doctrines, writings,  documents, and meetings on Deng Xiaoping's thought and theory --  is an effective tool for studying, researching, and propagating  his thought and theory.    While primarily reflecting Deng Xiaoping's theory on  building  socialism with Chinese characteristics, the dictionary also  fully covers his previous theoretical contributions.    Entries in the dictionary are classified into major entries  and general entries. The dozen or so major entries contributed  by such authoritative figures as Qian Qichen, Zhang Siqing,  Zheng Wenhan, Gong Yuzhi [7895 5148 0037], Wu Jinglian, and  edited by Chao Feng [1560 1496] separately and briefly introduce  Deng Xiaoping's thought and theory as well as his contributions  in other fields such as philosophy, politics, law, economics,  military affairs, diplomacy, education, science and technology,  literature and art, and party building. In carrying deep  theoretical significance and academic values, the dictionary  reflects the complete system of Deng Xiaoping's thought and  theory.</p>

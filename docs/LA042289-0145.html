			<p><P> April 22, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MCDONNELL DOUGLAS INFORMATION SYSTEMS LOST $9 MILLION IN FIRST QUARTER  </P> <P> Irvine-based McDonnell Douglas Information Systems Co., which has posted losses  for each of the last 5 years, on Friday reported an operating loss of $9  million for the first quarter.  </P> <P> But company officials said they were encouraged because the loss was a sharp  improvement over the whopping $28-million deficit recorded during the same  period in 1988.  </P> <P> Information Systems is a unit of McDonnell Douglas Corp., a St. Louis-based  aerospace and defense giant, and is an amalgam of companies in various  high-technology businesses.  </P> <P> Information Systems has been undergoing a reorganization and cost-cutting drive  in an effort to reduce its losses, said Nissen Davis, a company spokesman.  </P> <P> As part of that restructuring, the company recently sold its Irvine-based  hospital computer business to a unit of American Express Co. The company has  also reduced its worldwide employment from 12,000 in early 1988 to just 9,000  currently.  </P> <P> "We've really tightened our belts and eliminated a lot of costs," Davis said.  "We've concentrated on those areas of the business that are profitable. We  believe the company is well on its way to recovery."  </P> <P> Davis said that excluding costs associated with debt payments on some  businesses acquired several years ago, Information Systems would have reported  a profit for the quarter.

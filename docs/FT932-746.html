			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: International bond funds CURRENCY PLAYS are an important component of international bond investing and fund managers indicate that this is where the main gains in coming months may be. International bond funds deal in securities issued by foreign (and UK) governments and corporations. The opportunity for better performance is, in theory, greater than for onshore funds since they have a choice of bond markets to invest in and are able to use different currencies to their advantage. But with greater opportunity comes greater risk: these funds are regarded as more volatile than onshore bond funds, although less risky than equities. The table shows the 10 largest funds with one year performance figures figures. On that basis, Schroder's Global bond fund, with Pounds 58.3m under management, has been excluded. Yields have dropped slightly but not significantly since we last published the table, on May 22. Nick Henderson, head of fixed interest at Gartmore, expects the return from international bonds to be greater than for cash over the next year against a background of global growth and low inflation. He expects currency gains from an appreciation of the dollar and the yen against sterling and capital gains in continental Europe where interest rates, led by Germany, should continue their fall. The fund's holding is 49 per cent in US dollar-denominated bonds, 16 per cent in Canadian bonds and 12 per cent in yen-denominated bonds. The rest is in France (2 per cent), Italy (3 per cent), Denmark (4 per cent), Spain (7 per cent) and the UK (7 per cent). Although this is a 'total returns' fund, the yield is lower than for most of the other funds, reflecting, according to Henderson, its current weighting to the US market. Perpetual's Global bond fund, managed by George McNeil of Alpha, is also heavily invested in dollar-denominated bonds. The fund is top of the sector in terms of performance over one year and has a healthy yield. The currency breakdown is US dollar (40 per cent), Canadian dollar (10 per cent), gilts (17-18 per cent); the rest is in French, Spanish and Danish bonds, which are all hedged into sterling. 'Over the next nine months the dollar could rise to Dollars 1.80 or Dollars 1.85 against the D-mark. Sterling will perform less well against the dollar but will do well against everything else,' says mcNeill. He is eschewing the Japanese market, which formed part of the portfolio last year, because it now looks overvalued. The fund has a 5.25 per cent initial charge and a 1 per cent annual management fee with a minimum investment of Pounds 1,000. Charges on the Gartmore fund are 3.75 per cent initial, 0.75 management. Minimum lump sum investment is Pounds 1,000.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                    LARGEST 10 INTERNATIONAL BOND FUNDS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Fund                       Size (Pounds m)   Yield**** (%)   Perf* (%)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Mercury Global Bond            246.4             5.26          20.6 Baring Global Bond             167.6             5.40          18.2 Perpetual Global Bond           69.2             6.43          25.1 City Fin Beckman Int            50.1             3.08          18.9 Fidelity Intl Bond              35.0             5.81          19.5 Norwich Intl Bond               27.6             5.10          24.9 Cannon Intl Curr Bond           25.7             5.13          22.9 Gartmore Global Bond            21.2             4.67          20.1 S&amp;P Intl Bond                   20.5             5.51          23.6 Guiness Flight EMU              19.7             8.91           6.8 Sector average                  30.8             5.56          19.3  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Finstat **** As at June 22. *Offer-to-bid with net income reinvested over year to June 1.

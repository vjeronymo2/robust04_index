			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities unruffled by profit-takers PROFIT-TAKERS were that little more forceful in the UK stock market yesterday as the first leg of the trading account came to a close. Some sizeable lines of stock came on offer and the fall of 11.6 on the FT-SE Index would have been around seven points greater had it not been for a strong performance from Glaxo as the shares celebrated approval from the US authorities of Imigran, its migraine treatment. Traders sounded undismayed, however, pointing out that most of the selling came in stocks such as ICI, Hanson and Reuters where investors have significant profits to take. Stock index futures gave a less positive guide but traders continued to roll positions over into the March contract which becomes the market leader at the end of this month. Economic news during the day was relatively positive, with new car sales in the UK higher in November and the latest employment data from the US bearing out the recent indications of improved manufacturing activity. It was also disclosed that the US and the European Community had signed agreements on farm trade. But the UK stock market was preoccupied with its own concerns, paying little attention to the continued firmness in sterling. Government bonds rallied from early falls to close only a shade off. Equities opened firmer, largely reflecting the predicted rally in Hong Kong, but soon turned down as two selling programmes appeared on the trading screens. The market quickly dipped by 14.8 to FT-SE 2,756.2, but this proved the low of the day. Shares hung fire for the rest of the day drawing little inspiration from a slow start on Wall Street where the Dow gained only 4 points in UK hours. The final reading showed the FT-SE Index at 2,759.4 for a net fall of 11.6, making a loss of less than one Footsie point over the week. Interest in second line issues re-appeared yesterday, lifting the FT-SE Mid 250 Index by 6.3 points. Lines of shares offered found a ready reception among marketmakers anxious to attract some stock. Seaq-reported trading volume remained fairly at 676.1m shares compared with 669.5m in the previous session. Thursday's retail business increased to a worth of Pounds 1.49bn, one of the best daily totals since the present advance in the market commenced in mid-September when sterling made its hasty exit from the European exchange rate system. Retail turnover has remained above last year's daily averages, in spite of the apparent slowdown in the stock market this week.</p>

			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Post Office set to expand into travel insurance sales The Post Office is close to a deal with a leading insurer that would enable it to sell travel insurance through many of its 20,000 branches. The deal, expected to be finalised by January, is part of a drive by the Post Office to expand the range of products and services offered through what the government has described as the largest chain of shops in Europe. Three companies are understood to be on the shortlist for the travel insurance deal. The arrangement is likely to be structured to give the Post Office a percentage on every policy or block of policies sold. News of the transaction comes less than two weeks after the government was forced to abandon plans to privatise Royal Mail, the Post Office's letters division, following opposition from some Tory backbenchers. Post Office managers are now keen to exploit new government guidelines on the range of transactions that can be handled through the organisation's retail network, Post Office Counters, and are seeking to branch out into financial services and insurance. According to Mr Bill Cockburn, chief executive, new business generated as a result of the relaxation of the guidelines may eventually account for as much Post Office Counters business as Royal Mail does. In the year to March 1994, Royal Mail accounted for Pounds 221m of the branch network's Pounds 1.09bn turnover. Mr Cockburn added: 'Within a five-to-10-year timescale, we should be thinking about creating a significantly larger raft of new business in the Post Office as a result of the wider powers the government has given us. The thing the post offices are very good at is doing nationwide transactions in very large quantities.' Since May, the organisation has offered bureau de change services, in conjunction with the Bank of Ireland, at some 4,000 Post Office branches. About 1,500 branches were involved in this week's launch of the UK's national lottery. The new guidelines were set out this year in the government's consultative paper on the future of postal services. Previously, the Post Office was allowed to do business only for the public sector and recently privatised utilities. The paper also set out plans to bring 'rapidly to fruition' a Pounds 130m project to automate benefits payments. Fight for more commercial freedom, Page 13</p>

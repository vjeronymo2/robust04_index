			<p>BFN     [Text] During today's session of the National Assembly of  the People's Government [ANPP], Jose Luis Rodriguez, Cuba's  minister of finances and prices, pointed out that there is a  consensus on raising prices on products such as cigarettes and  explained how its implementation would be beneficial. He also  referred to studies on charging for services which have been  designated as nonessential gratuities. He acknowledged that the  most controversial point of discussion has been the tax system.    [Begin Rodriguez recording] Nevertheless, other taxes are  placed on the income of specified citizens who, because of their  job or other reasons, obtain incomes that have another level of  interpretation. Such is the case, to give an example, of the  taxes on self-employed workers who are charged a fixed fee. This  measure has been applied nationwide.    There are other types of taxes that people pay, which have  been discussed. Today, it was reported that the population has  paid those taxes and does not question them as much. We could  mention the tax on vehicle registration, known as the tax on  tags; the tax on documents, which is paid with stamps; the tax  to transfer properties, as in the case of inheritances. In other  words, there is a series of taxes that the population has been  paying and that does not cause so much perplexity among the  people.    I would say that the highest level of concern has been on  income taxes, which have not been supported massively even  though some workers have expressed themselves in favor of this  tax. [end recording]    Jose Luis Rodriguez concluded his intervention today at the  ANPP session by stating that these measures would be incomplete  without the repression of money hoarders.    During a recess of this session, Jose Luis Rodriguez said  that the proposals presented by the Ministry of Finances would  be implemented gradually, depending on ANPP decisions.    [Begin Rodriguez recording] I believe it will be up to the  government to examine, in this group of measures which will  presumably be recommended by the assembly, their appropriateness  according to the timing and the degree to which each one of the  measures is introduced. [end recording]    But according to the criteria of Cuban economists, the  restructuring of domestic finances is not enough to change the  current economic situation. Such was the opinion of Manuel  Millar, vice minister of finances and prices.    [Begin Millar recording] As the workers explained during the  workers parliaments, it is about creating the conditions to  achieve an increase in production, a higher value of the  national currency in order to stimulate more interest and  greater productivity and efficiency by the workers. It is not  only important to produce, but to produce efficiently, at the  lowest cost, trying to do the most with the scant resources we  have, to be able to increase our exportable goods and increase  the supply of goods and services to the population. Our future  success is based on this and the final consequences of all the  plans and measures that are being proposed to the ANPP. [end  recording]    According to specialists, public debate will be vital in  achieving political effectiveness in the application of these  adjustment measures. Those were the words of Dario Machado of  the center of social-political studies.    [Begin Machado recording] It is not only vital, but  inevitable. Because among the traits of our populations's  political culture is the participation in general and national  issues. It has been a practice of many years' standing. I can  mention the debate of the call to the congress, or the debate  for the draft of the Constitution prior to being submitted for  referendum, and many other occasions on which the people have  had the opportunity to participate. [end recording]    Even before the conclusion of the debates, Hortensia Chong,  a  base-level deputy, commented on the transcendental importance of  ANPP decisions.    [Begin Chong recording] Our people expect us to reach the  decisions that will allow us to establish the conditions so that  our country can take off, and we can offer the people better  living conditions within the next few months and years. That is  why I say that this moment is historic. [end recording]    It is significant and distinctive that this parliament began  with the intervention of the secretary general of the Cuban  Workers Federation [CTC], who explained the results of the  public debates, an order that seems logical to observers and  essential to the Cuban people.</p>

They said a 27-man "national dialogue committee" entrusted  with resolving differences between the northern president and  his deputy, a southerner, agreed on the measures in Aden late on  Monday.    The sources said the measures appeared to go some way  towards  appeasing the Aden-based Yemen Socialist Party (YSP) of  Vice-President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, who has stayed away from the  capital Sanaa since July amid fears that the 1990 merger between  North and South Yemen may be threatened.    The accord calls for the withdrawal of troops and military  encampments from major Yemeni cities and the arrest of Yemenis  suspected of involvement in a spate of political killings.    The YSP, which is unified Yemen's second largest party and  ruled the former Marxist South Yemen before the merger, says at  least 150 of its members have been assassinated in the past few  months--the latest was a pro-YSP tribal leader killed on Friday  in Sanaa.    The sources said the accord also meets a key YSP demand for  the central bank to come under the authority of the government  headed by the YSP's Haydar Abu Bakr al-Attas. It has so far  been under President 'Ali Abdallah Salih, a conservative who  ruled North Yemen until the merger. The YSP earlier rejected  reconciliation with Mr. Salih and his General People's Congress  (GPC), impoverished Yemen's largest party, unless steps were  taken to implement its 18 demands.    Southern sources say the YSP would not be satisfied with  promises and wanted to see concrete actions before ending its  boycott of Mr. Salih. It says the two sides had in the past  reached several accords which were never implemented.    The three parties in the ruling coalition--the YSP, GPC and  the Islamist Islah--have been meeting with other Yemeni  politicians in Aden for the past 10 days after holding several  sessions of the commitee in the north.    Each of the three parties has five members. The committee  also includes five opposition representatives and seven of the  country's leading figures such as former presidents.    The sources said that among other points agreed were  government spending cuts, anti-corruption measures and some  decentralisation measures that would reduce the power of the  central government in Sanaa. It was also agreed that a date be  set for local elections after last year's first democratic  general elections. [passage omitted]</p>

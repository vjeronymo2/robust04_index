			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Business and the Environment: Left to regulate without reward British companies are failing to capture the new international markets for environmental technology, says a report* which claims British industry is lagging well behind Germany, the world leader. The report, conducted ahead of one of this spring's leading trade exhibitions for environmental technology, analyses responses from 300 British companies, which make up around a tenth of the industry. The clearest finding is that environmental regulation is the driving force behind the market's growth. More than three-quarters of the respondents said UK legislation was the reason for their customers buying environmental technology, and 61 per cent gave European legislation as the main factor. Ministers have been keen to emphasise that 'greener' can mean 'richer': that some people can make money from environmental regulation even though others will pay more. However, the report suggests that while the costs of regulation are borne by UK companies and consumers, much of the value of the market in environmental technology goes overseas. The OECD and the US Environmental Protection Agency have both suggested that the world market for environmental products and services is currently worth Dollars 200bn (Pounds 135bn). They differ on estimates for its value by the end of the decade: the OECD thinks Dollars 300bn, and the EPA doubles that sum. But forecasters agree that the main growth will come from demand for waste management, air pollution control and water treatment technology. German companies have captured 21 per cent of that world market, the survey estimates. In contrast, the 'nascent' British industry is made up mainly of small companies, it says. * The British Environmental Technology Industry Survey January 1994, Environmental Policy Consultants.

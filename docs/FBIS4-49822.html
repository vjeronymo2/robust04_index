			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Reporter Guo Yuxue (6753 3768 1331): "Mobilize and </F> Concentrate Efforts To Improve Large and Medium-Sized  State-Owned Enterprises"]    [Text] An important task of the current economic work is  how to comply with the requirement for establishing the  socialist market economy system and step up improvement of large  and medium-sized state-owned enterprises to enable them to play  a greater role in deepening reform, developing the economy, and  stabilizing society. With this task in mind, He Zhukang,  secretary of the provincial party committee, conducted  investigation and study in Jilin city from 25 to 29 April.    Comrade He Zhukang heard an overall work report by a leading  comrade of the Jilin city party committee and held discussions  with the responsible persons of 30 large and medium-sized  state-owned enterprises of different types at three forums,  including the Jilin Chemical Fiber Limited Company, Jilin  Ferroalloy Plant, Songyuan Food Industrial Company, and Jilin  city company of chemicals for daily use. Directors (managers)  and party secretaries of these enterprises talked freely about  their methods and experiences to transform mechanisms, improve  management, enhance skills, increase benefits, and strengthen  party building in the new situation of establishing the  socialist market economy system and, based on their specific  conditions, offered views and suggestions on how to overcome the  current difficulties by deepening reform and how to enable  enterprises to extract themselves from the predicament, enhance  their vigor, and improve economic benefits. Comrade He Zhukang  also conducted field investigation at the Jilin Chemical Fiber  Limited Company, Jinuoer Electric Appliance (Group) Company,  Jilin Woolen Mill, and two other plants.    Comrade He Zhukang spoke highly of the great amount of  fruitful work carried out by the Jilin city party committee and  government since the beginning of this year to develop the  economy, safeguard social stability, strengthen party building,  and, in particular, improve large and medium-sized state-owned  enterprises. He fully affirmed the methods and experiences of  some enterprises, which had deepened reform continuously,  stepped up technical transformation, served the needs of the  domestic and world markets, and improved economic benefits  despite the many difficulties they encountered. He pointed out:  Large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises constitute the  core of the socialist public sector of the economy, the pillar  and backbone of the national economy, and the major source of  state revenue. How they are developed is not only an important  economic issue but also an important political and social issue  because it concerns the overall situation of reform,  development, and stability and the socialist orientation of  taking public ownership as the foundation. Whether large and  medium-sized state-owned enterprises can be improved represents  a severe test for our party and government. Party committees  and governments at all levels must take this issue seriously  from this perspective. Judging from the conditions of Jilin city  and the entire province, they have adopted some effective  measures since early this year when the provincial party  committee held a work conference on improvement of large and  medium-sized state-owned enterprises; some enterprises have  begun to invigorate; others are still very difficult, but their  bright prospects have shown; and enterprises which can find no  way out are very few. This shows that not only should we  improve as demanded by the situation, but also we have the  methods to improve. We need to further unify our thinking, be  determined, mobilize and concentrate efforts to perform work in  line with the requirements of the three-year plan of the  provincial party committee and government for improving large  and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, and improve these  enterprises group after group at different times. Not only  should leaders at all levels attach great importance to this  issue, but also all trades and professions and all fields should  achieve a common understanding, regard improvement of large and  medium-sized state-owned enterprises as the most important and  urgent task for the present, and muster some financial resources  and create favorable conditions to invigorate them first even if  this means that some fields have to tighten up their financial  resources for some time. When large and medium-sized  state-owned enterprises are not improved, other fields of work  cannot be promoted. For this reason, all fields should provide  necessary conditions and support to improve large and  medium-sized state-owned enterprises.    Comrade He Zhukang said: The entire industrial sector of  the economy, especially large and medium-sized state-owned  enterprises, is in a very crucial period for development and in  a very important period for change. First, it has become an  irresistible development trend to change the planned economy to  the market economy, and the operating mechanism for the market  economy has begun to enter enterprises and property right  relations and is being gradually standardized. Second, the  consumption pattern in people's life has effected a significant  change because they have stepped from merely having sufficient  food and clothes to a moderately prosperous life. This requires  adjustment of the entire economic structure, especially the  structure of the industrial economy. Third, new worldwide  technological revolution and the rapid development of modern  science and technology have brought about increasingly intense  competition in the world economy. To gain a foothold in the  competition, Jilin should also accelerate its economic  restructuring. Meanwhile, the change in the economic system and  the structural adjustment call for the compliance of all the  spheres of the superstructure and the improvement of people's  quality. Such a change represents a challenge and also a new  opportunity. We should have a full understanding of this, study  and arrange it early, acquire a better and comprehensive  understanding of this important change and crucial period for  development, guide action according to circumstances, and  correctly make decisions. This is an important responsibility of  leading cadres and also a test for them. We should fully  understand the urgency of this issue, greatly mobilize our  efforts, and plunge ourselves heart and soul into reform and  development. We should be aware of the crisis like a boat  sailing against the current which must forge ahead or will be  driven back, display the indomitable spirit, have the ability to  learn and the courage to explore in the practice of reform and  development, conquer difficulties, and enhance ability.    Comrade He Zhukang pointed out: In the period for the  historical change and in the new situation, our understanding  often falls behind practice due to our lack of mental  preparations, and our concepts, work ideas, and work methods are  very incompatible. As far as the endeavor to improve large and  medium-sized state-owned enterprises is concerned, we still need  to further unify thinking and enhance the understanding of some  issues so as to pool more efforts and achieve greater results.    First, in the overall economic pattern of establishing the  socialist market economy system, large and medium-sized  state-owned enterprises will and should continue to play a key  role and improve themselves without wavering. They have no  other choice.    Second, we should enhance confidence. Despite the many  difficulties, we also have many favorable conditions and great  potential for improving large and medium-sized state-owned  enterprises. The key is to enhance confidence and be firm to  carry out work through to the end.    Third, when improving large and medium-sized state-owned  enterprises, we should have new concepts and new ideas instead  of the old methods adopted during the period for the planned  economy. Improving large and medium-sized state-owned  enterprises requires support and necessary assistance from the  government. Relevant government departments should actively  help enterprises unload the heavy historical burden.  Enterprises, however, should understand that in the condition  of the market economy, they should rely on their own efforts and  should march toward the market to invigorate themselves.  Therefore, we should further lift control over enterprises and  grant them all the decision-making power they are entitled to as  stipulated in the "enterprise law," so that they will truly have  the courage to adopt various effective measures to develop  themselves. Meanwhile, state-owned enterprises should also  further emancipate the mind, broaden their field of thinking,  allow the adoption of different ownerships at state-owned  enterprises, and have the ability to bring in funds from abroad  to conduct technical transformation. Regarding this work, we  should have the courage to seek truth from facts and be willing  to allow others to gain benefits. Only when these enterprises  are invigorated can they achieve development.    Fourth, we should not only adopt various measures,  strengthen  management, and accelerate technical transformation and  development of new products to improve large and medium-sized  state-owned enterprises. But we should also pay close attention  to the central link of reform of the property right system. We  should adopt every means to make the best use of the assets  available by selling or leasing them out, reorganizing them, or  transplanting them to others. We should raise funds for  technical transformation and construction through various  channels. When buying new assets, we should make accurate  selection to ensure that they create good benefits, enjoy a good  market, and have bright prospects.    Fifth, we should take both current and long-term work into  consideration, first make current work successful, and, in the  meantime, study the strategy for long-term development. We  should adopt every means possible to guarantee the production of  the enterprises whose products are of good quality and sell well  in the market and muster efforts to support them. We should  strengthen marketing, reduce stockpiles, and adopt various  effective means to reduce deficits and increase profits and  revenues.    Sixth, establishing the social security system is a task  that  brooks no delay. We should actively probe into it with new  ideas.    Seventh, we should trust and rely on the masses. Staff  members and workers are the major participators in reform and  development. We should mobilize them to discuss the major  affairs of enterprises and fully stimulate the enthusiasm of all  fields. We should combine material incentives with spiritual  encouragement and strict demands with concern and love, give  full play to the role of advanced examples as models and leaders  and the role of trade unions, Communist Youth League, women's  federations, and other mass organizations as bridges and  channels, and lead people's enthusiasm to reform and  development. We should show concern for and cherish those with  outstanding achievements in improving large and medium- sized  state-owned enterprises, improve their material benefits, and  commend them so that more such people will emerge.    Comrade He Zhukang urged: In the process of improving large  and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, we should strengthen  and improve party leadership. Party committees at all levels  should take the overall situation in view to correctly handle  the relations between reform, development, and stability, have  the ability to observe and think over issues from a political  view, continuously enhance the sense of respect for party  leadership and the overall situation, coordinate well the  relations between various sectors, and conscientiously implement  the work principles of the party Central Committee and the work  arrangements of the provincial party committee. A very  important point in strengthening party leadership is to further  implement the principle of democratic centralism. All important  issues should be decided after collective discussions of party  committees, and their implementation should be organized  according to the division of work. We should place reform,  development, and stability at the center of party committee's  work. We should carry out the various reform measures in line  with Jilin's actual conditions; often restructure the economy  with new ideas and methods, improve the quality of enterprises,  and maintain sustained, stable, and healthy economic  development; and adhere to the principle of attaching equal  importance to the two tasks and never wavering in either,  strengthen ideological and political work, achieve success in  punishing corruption, advocating honesty, and maintaining public  order, and safeguard social stability. Leaders at all levels  should improve work styles, intensify investigation and study,  maintain close ties with the masses, guard against exaggeration,  and oppose formalism. In view of the new situation, cadres at  all levels should intensify the study of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the  knowledge on the socialist market economy, the knowledge on  modern science and technology, and the knowledge on laws. They  should step up correct and comprehensive analysis of the  situation and think over some major issues on theories and  practice in line with reality to gain more foresight and  initiative in work.    When in Jilin city, Comrade He Zhukang also held a  discussion  on agriculture and rural work with the responsible comrades of  relevant departments of the city party committee and government  and inspected the development of the tertiary industry in the  Tiannan Township of Jiaohe city.    Participating in the investigation and study activities were  Vice Governor Wei Minxue and responsible comrades of the general  office, organization departments, and research office of the  provincial party committee, the provincial commission for  restructuring of the economy, provincial economic and trade  commission, provincial finance department, Jilin Provincial  bureau of the State Taxation Administration, provincial labor  department, provincial industrial and commercial bank, and  provincial trade union council.</p>

			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / Observer: Shin-jinrui get itchy feet The urgent call put through to Yoshi Noguchi as head of a smallish US company's branch in Japan, came from the young Japanese he'd just recruited as sales manager from one of the country's best known groups. Regretfully, the caller announced he wouldn't be taking up the job, adding by way of explanation: 'I'm not married, you see.' 'That probably strikes you as meaningless,' says Noguchi five years later. 'But to a Japanese, it makes perfect sense. If you're ambitious, then as well as the right credentials - approved kindergarten, schools, university and so on - convention requires you to have the right sort of wife. You simply won't be able to attract one unless you work for an organisation with a famous name.' It was impatience with such conventions that finally led Noguchi to divorce himself from his native land and set up in Los Angeles as a headhunter with the Paul Ray International executive-search firm. And he reckons that, while most Japanese still prefer the established customs, a growing number of managerial high-fliers are minded to follow suit. 'They're the new generation, the shin-jinrui who put making their own fortune above serving their company even though it may employ them for life. That traditionally means rising slowly to a senior job in the mainstream, then being put out to grass in a subsidiary until you retire. The conventional term for it is amakudari or 'descending from heaven', but the young set call it iki-goroshi: 'being buried alive'. 'Besides,' Noguchi adds, 'with the recession, they've seen lots of their elders being given, not amakudari but kata-tataki - the pat on the shoulder that means 'Thanks for doing a good job, now clear your desk and go'.'</p>

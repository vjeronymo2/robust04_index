			<p><P> September 19, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DEAL CLEARS WAY FOR LIMITED MIRAMAR LAKE DEVELOPMENT  </P> <P> The San Diego City Council on Tuesday unanimously agreed to settle a Scripps  Ranch developer's lawsuit, saving much of the hillside around Miramar Lake  while opening the way for construction of about 3,360 housing units.  </P> <P> The agreement between the city and the development partnership of McMillin-BCED  brings to a halt a lawsuit the developer filed protesting the City Council's  action last February, when it approved an emergency interim ordinance  restricting construction along the lake's northern shore.  </P> <P> In many ways, the settlement signals the end of the beginning in a long battle  over development of what is called Miramar Ranch North. Many of the land-use  agreements contained in the settlement, ranging from amendments to the area's  community development plan to a specific development agreement with the city,  must be voted on separately. Some of the votes aren't scheduled until April.  </P> <P> Among the main elements in the complex settlement are:  </P> <P> * Turning a proposed industrial park into a 300-unit multifamily residential  project.  </P> <P> * Reducing the number of housing units around the lake by 498 to 590, a  decrease of 54%.  </P> <P> * Increasing the amount of open space in the 1,200-acre development to 255  acres.  </P> <P> * Reducing the number of hillside homes in the lake's "viewshed" from about 400  to approximately 80.  </P> <P> * Moving a proposed alignment of Scripps Ranch Boulevard away from the lake.  </P> <P> * Increasing to six years the construction timetable of the 3,360 housing  units.  </P> <P> In addition, the agreement calls on the developer to consider building a town  center complex and moving a school site.  </P> <P> The agreement also requires the developer to begin building a major roadway in  the area -- Scripps Ranch North Parkway -- as well as provide money to build a  library and other public facilities, including the Mercy Road interchange with  Interstate 15.  </P> <P> In return, the city agreed to the following major points:  </P> <P> * Giving the developer a $24-million credit against future imposition of  citywide impact fees.  </P> <P> * Essentially exempting the developer from regulations in the city's  environmental ordinance, formally known as the Resource Protection Ordinance.  </P> <P> * Giving the developer an exemption from any future growth-control ordinance  approved by the City Council. McMillin-BCED, however, would still be covered by  any growth-control initiatives placed on the ballot by the public.  </P> <P> * If the developer is delayed or made to stop building because of various  decisions by the city as outlined in the agreement, the city would be forced to  reimburse McMillin-BCED millions of dollars.  </P> <P> The agreement also calls for the creation of a $56.5-million fund to pay for  many of the public improvements needed by new growth in Miramar Ranch North.  </P> <P> Various community groups -- such as the Save the Lake Committee -- told the  City Council they supported the many land-use changes contained in the  settlement agreement, though they wanted to read and analyze the agreement  before supporting it 100%.  </P> <P> The agreement itself was only made public Tuesday after it was discussed by the  council in closed session.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Linda Bernhardt, who represents Scripps Ranch and who played a  major role in initiating the settlement, said the agreement was a victory for  the neighborhoods in the area that for several years have fought to be part of  the political process.  </P></p>

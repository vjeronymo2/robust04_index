			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Private bank opens in Tanzania THE first private-sector commercial bank opened yesterday in Tanzania, Leslie Crawford reports from Nairobi. The opening ends nearly three decades of state banking monopoly in this east African nation. Meridien Biao is the first of two commercial banks to set up business in the city of Dar-es-Salaam. Standard Chartered bank will have its official opening next month. The launch of competitive banking forms part of President Hassan Mwinyi's efforts to liberalise the former socialist economy. Mr Mwinyi, who has ruled Tanzania since Mr Julius Nyerere's retirement in 1985, has also introduced central-bank dollar auctions with the aim of eventually liberalising foreign exchange controls.</p>

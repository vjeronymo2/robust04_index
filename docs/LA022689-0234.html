			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'BIG HARRY' RECALLED AS RECREATION'S 'GENTLE GIANT'  </P> <P> Hundreds of Huntington Beach residents gathered under a giant pine tree  Saturday to mourn Harry Montague and remember his work with the city's youth.  </P> <P> Fondly known as "Big Harry," Montague was with the recreation department for 12  years, coaching the essentials of sports and offering a willing ear to those in  need.  </P> <P> "He was a gentle giant," remembered co-worker Suzie Smith of the 6-foot,  5-inch, 240-pound Montague. "He just had a way about him that the kids were  drawn to. They were very comfortable with him."  </P> <P> Montague, an avid bicyclist, was killed last June in a bicycle accident on  Pacific Coast Highway. He was 40.  </P> <P> Although he enjoyed all sports, Montague's true love was basketball. With  dozens of the young athletes he coached looking on Saturday, a towering pine  tree in front of city basketball courts at 21377 Magnolia Ave., along with a  plaque, were dedicated to his memory.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Scholarship Fund Created  </P> <P> And four young athletes -- two young men and two young women -- were awarded  the first Montague scholarships from a fund created after his death by friends  and relatives.  </P> <P> The $10,000 scholarship fund yielded the first four $400 scholarships. Each  winner was a member of the Edison High School varsity basketball team. They  were Laura Radloff, Tiffany Nii, Jason Carey and Bryan Murphy.  </P> <P> Nii called Montague "the nicest man I ever met."  </P> <P> For Carey, Montague was "one of the most influential persons in my life. He got  me started in basketball in the third grade. . . . He was truly a good friend."  </P> <P> "Harry never blew his own horn," said Shirley Carey, Jason's mother. "He may  not have realized the impact he had. We all thought he would be around  forever."  </P> <P> His mother, Evelyn Montague, was pleased with the memorial. She said she was  both gratified and surprised at the outpouring of affection.  </P> <P> "I didn't know him as a community leader," Evelyn Montague said. "I just knew  him as a kidder at home."  </P> <P> Montague grew up in Long Beach and went to Millikan High School and Long Beach  City College. He earned an economics degree at UCLA and a masters degree in  recreation from Cal State Long Beach.  </P> <P> Bob Werth, the city's senior recreation supervisor, said Montague viewed his  position as more than a job and that he had an  "above-and-beyond-the-call-of-duty attitude."  </P> <P> "He saw hundreds of kids each day and he knew almost all of them by name,"  Werth said. "He even knew a little something about each one. He had an  outstanding memory."  </P> <P> "He is being sorely missed. Very few like him come along," Smith said. "He  encouraged the kids that had potential to get into coaching. He gave them a  sense of responsibility. Harry saw in them what others didn't see."  </P></p>

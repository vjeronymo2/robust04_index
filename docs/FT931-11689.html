			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Sellers hurt Glaxo LEADING UK pharmaceuticals group Glaxo was one of the few significant casualties in an otherwise very buoyant London market yesterday, as US investors sold the international drug manufacturer heavily. Analysts, seeking a rationale, focused on an article in a US financial magazine, but the slide in the shares appeared to herald weakness throughout the sector. The US article, officially published yesterday, featured an interview with four senior institutional investors. One highlighted Glaxo and Merck as his key sells, arguing that Glaxo's gross margins are 82 per cent while pre-tax margins are only 35 per cent. Glaxo shares, which had been up 16p at the start of trading on the beneficial effect of a stronger dollar against sterling, turned around to record an equivalent fall to 678p on heavy turnover of 7m. The slide prompted marketmakers to look around for the next victim. Wellcome, 14 ahead at first, closed 25 down at 876p. Demand for RBoS The best individual performance of any FT-SE 100 Index stock came from Royal Bank of Scotland (RBoS), which raced up 21, or 9.1 per cent, to 251p, the highest level for the shares since the early 1980s. The rise compared with a 3.1 per cent increase in the FT-Actuaries banks index and a 1.6 per cent gain in the FT-SE 100. Much of the rise in RBoS was attributed to one of the leading marketmaking firms having to scramble to cover a short position in the stock, triggered by some rather exaggerated expectations of the price RBoS may get for Charterhouse Bank. The latter has been up for sale for many months and there are strong hints that two Continental banks, Germany's BHF and Credit Commercial de France are each about to buy a 45 per cent stake, leaving RBoS with 10 per cent. Banking analysts said Charterhouse would probably fetch a sale price of Pounds 200m, but there were stories circulating in the market yesterday that a much higher figure might be on the cards. LIG weakens Photo-processing to condom manufacturer London International (LIG) fell 22 to 249p as the company warned that profits would be even lower than it had signalled last year. The company took the unusual step of telephoning analysts individually rather than putting out an announcement via the Stock Exchange information service. LIG said laboratory closures in the troubled photo-processing arm were taking longer than previously expected. Most pharmaceuticals specialists chopped their figures for this year and next. Smith New Court was at the low end, coming down by Pounds 4m to Pounds 33m for this year and by the same amount to Pounds 43m for 1994. Arjo Wiggins firm Troubled paper maker Arjo Wiggins Appleton saw a reversal of fortunes as the company broker upgraded its recommendation. The shares rose to their highest level since plummeting in September when Arjo chopped its interim dividend. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew moved its recommendation from a corporate hold, which many would see as a sell recommendation in view of the firm's relationship with the company, to a long term buy. UBS believes the signs of recovery in the US - where Arjo generates 75 per cent of its profits - and the recent management changes augur well for the company. However, the broker sounds a note of caution on prospects for high quality coated paper manufacture in continental Europe. The shares rose 10 to 173p with 4.7m traded, showing signs of a chart break-out. Kwik Save adrift Discount food retailer Kwik Save retreated as a number of factors combined to build negative sentiment against the stock. Prominent among these were reports that the private German discount food group Aldi is actively searching for fresh superstore sites in the south-east. Kwik Save closed 8 adrift at 801p. There were also whispers that Asda would use the proceeds of its Pounds 347m rights issue last week to fund expansion of its Dales discount chain, again threatening Kwik Save's market domination. Asda shed  1/2 to 63 1/2 p xd in turnover of 27m shares, with a further 19.5m done in the options market. Finally, news that Iceland Frozen Foods is to strengthen its high street position through a joint venture with Littlewoods also weakened sentiment against Kwik Save. However, the move was seen as good news for Iceland Frozen, with analysts predicting that it would enhance earnings by around Pounds 80m by next year. Profit forecasts for this year were increased from around Pounds 61m to Pounds 68m. Banks were in the vanguard of the market's advance, still responding to last week's interest rate cut and the prospect of more to come, and reflecting increasing optimism ahead of the reporting season to be led by Lloyds Bank, 19 up at 559p. National Westminster moved ahead 17 to 459p and Barclays finished 16 higher at 436p. Abbey National advanced 11 1/2 to 380 1/2 p. The biggest turnover in the sector (10m shares) was in Bank of Scotland, which closed 2 1/2 firmer at 132p. The property sector was buoyant as two brokers adopted more positive stances amid speculation of further interest rate cuts. Among those stocks benefiting yesterday, British Land improved 11 to 209p, Land Securities 12 to 486p and MEPC 12 to 364p. The latest slide in sterling triggered a fresh flurry of strong domestic and international buying of oil shares. BP jumped 8 1/2 to 254p - a two-day rise of 16 1/2 - on heavy turnover of 14m shares, with shares held by US investors now thought to account for some 23 per cent of BP issued capital. Shell advanced 15 to 573p on 4.9m traded. Second-line oil stocks raced ahead, led by Clyde, 6 up at 46p, and Goal, 7 firmer at 62p. Premier rose 1 3/4 to 29p on heavy turnover of 8.6m, still supported by bid speculation. Burmah Castrol's big D-Mark exposure saw the shares climb 18 to 698p. Among aerospace and engineering stocks, British Aerospace climbed 21 to 274p in trade of 8.7m shares. The renewed strength led to speculation that the company may deliver a higher than originally forecast dividend for 1992. Vague talk of a possible bid for BAe from GEC, a penny easier at 290p, was also heard in some quarters. Rolls-Royce, a beneficiary of the recently signed Al-Yamamah 2 defence contract, of which BAe is the lead contractor, moved up 6 1/2 to 133p. Broker's recommendations in the US led to strong demand for British Steel and the shares firmed 4 to 77p, with volume climbing to 18m by the close. Sterling's weakness against the D-Mark and dollar helped a number of internationally traded stocks. Hanson moved forward 7 to 257 1/2 p and BAT Industries gained 17 at 978p. Mining group RTZ was lifted 17 to 680p. Auction house Christies International rose 14 to 155p on unusually high turnover of 10m shares as one investor bought a block of 5m shares at a premium 165p a share. Alexon moved ahead 9 to 74p on rumours that a predator was eyeing the retailer. Next, off 1 1/2 at 143 1/2 p, was the mentioned candidate, although most analysts were sceptical. NatWest Securities shifted its stance on Tesco, turning long-term seller of the stock, downgrading and advising clients to switch into J. Sainsbury or Kwik Save. The house blames Tesco's limited earnings growth potential. However, the shares gained 6 at 265p, helped by a Nomura upgrade. Sainsbury closed 5 ahead at 580p. Kingfisher advanced 8 to 557p, aided by a buy note from Kleinwort Benson, which believes the recent weakness in the shares to be overdone. The house also took Guinness off its sell list. The shares finished 7 stronger at 460p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992/93 NEW HIGHS (310). BRITISH FUNDS (21) AMERICANS (17) BANKS (6) Allied Irish, Bk. Ireland, Bk. Scot 9 3/4 pc Pf., Lloyds, Ryl. Bk.

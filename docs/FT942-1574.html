			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / International Company News: P&amp;P sues rival in Bridge Oil bid war Parker &amp; Parsley, the Texas-based oil independent which is bidding for Sydney-based Bridge Oil, has begun legal proceedings against Gantry, the rival suitor for Bridge, in the Dallas district courts. Gantry is the bid vehicle used by Jedi, an investment partnership owned jointly by Enron, the US natural gas company, and the California Public Employees Retirement System, one of the biggest US public pension funds. On Monday, Gantry entered the bidding for Bridge, offering 85 cents a share in cash and valuing the Australian company at ADollars 356.7m (USDollars 274.3m). This topped the P&amp;P offer, increased only minutes previously, of 80 cents at share. P&amp;P said that its suit alleged breaches of the US Securities Exchange Act, under which companies making a tender offer are prohibited from purchasing shares outside that offer, unless a waiver has first been obtained from the US Securities and Exchange Commission. It has sought an order barring Gantry/Jedi from buying shares in Bridge, outside of the tender offer. P&amp;P said it planned to examine data related to Bridge Oil's US subsidiary with the aim of 'fully evaluating options regarding the current offer of 80 cents a share'. P&amp;P claimed Gantry, whose bid has been recommended by the Bridge board, had access to additional, non-public information at Bridge Oil (USA). It has demanded similar access. The ADollars 500m bid by Mr Graeme Hart, a New Zealand businessman, in conjunction with Coles Myer, for Australia's Foodland Associated has been referred to the federal Treasury, 'to examine potential implications for competition policy'. Under the deal, Coles could end up owning the Australian assets of Foodland. This could give Coles a large stake in the West Australian grocery market.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Jan Fuele: "Will There Be a Referendum on the </F> President?"]    [Text] There are indications that, during the preelection  period, the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] will  attempt to organize also a referendum on curtailing the term of  office of the president of the Republic. This cold calculation  is, from the standpoint of the the HZDS, actually  understandable. Relations between the top people in the HZDS and  Michal Kovac are already such that, after the early  parliamentary elections, any kind of effective cooperation could  hardly be expected. Because the HZDS is firmly convinced that it  will win, it wants the president of the Republic to be someone  with whom it can manage to cooperate.    If we ostensibly digress from this topic, we find that the  HZDS has similar relations with almost all political entities.  The only exception is the Slovak National Party [SNS]. However,  this party has only minimal prospects of gaining seats in the  parliament. Then there is also part of the Greens, the small  Farmers' Party, and maybe the KSU [Christian Social Union]. The  HZDS has already had so many conflicts with the others that  calculating on a possible coalition would at the same time  require calculating on amnesia. If the HZDS is now publishing  advertisements in PRAVDA, it does so only in an effort to turn  the opinion of Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] adherents away  from the opinion of the party leadership, which is unequivocally  against a postelection coalition.    The motivation of the current HZDS politics no longer is to  create a new political reality, but only to adjust to existing  reality, which is mostly its own doing. The HZDS, whether it  wants to or not, must go against all, and, at the same time, its  only chance is that those who want to go together against it  will splinter.    This game was joined by even the president of the Republic.  He knows that the coming elections, even if they are not  combined with a referendum on curtailing his term in office,  will determine whether he stays or does not continue in office.  For that reason, as well, it can be expected that Michal Kovac  will become an active participant in the election campaign. For,  whether he admits it to himself or whether somebody else says  it, he cannot de jure dissolve the parliament in a time of  crisis. However, his authority to give a report on the state of  the Slovak Republic de facto was sufficient to call early  elections. So that even in those moments when the president  comports himself in an above-party manner, he can, by leaning  toward certain values that should apply among decent people,  influence in many ways the voters' decisions. Vladimir Meciar,  by attacking the president, robs himself voluntarily of one  psychological advantage--the Slovak voter intuitively leans  toward those who are being wronged. Thus far, it was Meciar who  acted that part; now he is beginning to share it to someone  else's benefit.    No matter how paradoxical it is, the HZDS finds itself in a  worse situation than Michal Kovac. For the HZDS, this is a  matter of going for broke. If it makes an attempt to call a  referendum, there is still time, but this time it will not have  at its disposal administrative offices; after all, signatures  were being collected even there. It would be more difficult to  collect a sufficient number of real signatures, and the only  thing that could help would be to further stir up the political  atmosphere. Besides that, among HZDS followers, there are still  not a few of those, whom even after his conflicts with the  movement still trust the president of the Republic. If in the  elections they had to vote in favor of the HZDS and, at the same  time, with their other vote make a decision on the curtailing of  the president's term in office, they would be in an unenviable  situation. And as a result, the HZDS could find itself in an  unenviable situation as well. The effect created by the  referendum on the president could have negative consequences on  the number of votes gained.    During the past week, we were able to read in PRAVDA that  the  HZDS is advertising for applications to "fill top government  jobs in the administration of the Slovak Republic." Even though  this is a remarkable head-start, signaling future changes (to  speak about purges ahead of time is not proper), maybe the HZDS  in its foresight should advertise for an appropriate president  of the Republic and for politicians willing to work with the  movement. It appears to be the last opportunity to "make"  friends. So far, the HZDS has had more skill in "splintering"  them.</p>

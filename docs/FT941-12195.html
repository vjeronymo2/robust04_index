			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Government to use parlimentary guillotine The government will use the parliamentary guillotine from today to curtail debate on the remaining stages of the finance bill. Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, last night justified this unusual course on the grounds that it had become clear that Labour leaders intended to persist with their procedural 'trench warfare' to obstruct the bill, which implements the Budget. On the first day of the bill's line-by-line committee stage, Labour MPs dominated a six-hour debate on a single clause dealing with the new tax on aircraft passengers. Mr Newton said it was clear that Labour MPs were intent on obstructing a key component of the government's legislative programme. The 417-page bill is the longest taxation measure ever introduced in the Commons. The timetable motion to be debated later today will require consideration of the remaining portion of the committee stage scheduled to be dealt with on the floor of the House to be completed by tonight. The motion will also set a date for completion of the rest of the proceedings due to take place in standing committee, and for the third reading.</p>

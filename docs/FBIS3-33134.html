Government Ministry sources told LOS TIEMPOS on 7 February  that the project to buy land from the peasants was proposed by  the government of President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada during the  latest meeting of the World Bank Consultative Group for Bolivia  late last year.    The sources said: "This option was proposed by the  negotiating commission that went to Washington to the  international community as a start of the Zero Option project."    They said the administration is seriously studying the idea  of buying from the thousands of peasants "their land" used for  growing coca.    The sources added: "The offer of $2,000 for every hectare  cleared of coca made by the previous government to Chapare  peasants, with a bonus of $500 per tract of land cleared of coca  is not an empty proposal."    The sources indicated that the government is willing to pay  up to $2,500 per hectare of coca to each peasant.    They added: "This means a farmer with 5,000 hectares, for  example, will have the possibility of getting approximately  $10,000 per hectare for the land he puts up for sale."  [sentence as published]    President Sanchez de Lozada decided to implement this  project  which was labeled "Zero Option" but the project is subject to  international financing for its implementation in the  medium-term.</p>

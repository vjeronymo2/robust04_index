			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By S.Y. Yue] </F>   [Text] The Legal Department has taken a major move in  anticipation of future Basic Law requirements by appointing two  local candidates as law officers who rank just below the  Attorney-General.    Daniel Fung, at 41 one of the youngest QCs in Hong Kong,  will  become Solicitor-General. Criminal lawyer Peter Nguyen will be  Director of Public Prosecutions.    They will be the first local Chinese to occupy the posts.  The appointments pave the way for a local Attorney-General.    Under the Basic Law, the Attorney-General should be a local  Chinese with no right of abode in any foreign country.    The present incumbent, Jeremy Mathews, and the five law  officers below him are expatriates.    Both Mr Fung and Mr Nguyen have been given three-year  contracts. Mr Fung will assume the post--vacant since the  departure of Bertrand de Speville to become ICAC [Independent  Commission Against Corruption] Commissioner in February last  year--in December and will serve beyond the change of  sovereignty in 1997.    Mr Nguyen, 51, will succeed retiring Director of Public  Prosecutions John Wood in two months and will serve until July  14 1997.    Yesterday, both expressed the wish to stay on to work for  the  future Special Administrative Region (SAR) government.    Mr Fung said he would renounce his British passport, which  he  obtained through studying in Britain.    "It would not be a difficult choice for me to renounce the  British passport and to have a SAR passport," he said.    Mr Nguyen, Chinese by nationality, was born in Vietnam. He  holds a British Dependent Territory Citizen's passport.    Traditionally, the Solicitor-General is regarded as the  shadow attorney-general and the front-runner for the job. But  Mr Fung said yesterday: "Since the post is occupied, there is  no room for me to speculate on that."    Although Mr Fung took donations to students staging a hunger  strike in Tiananmen Square during the pro-democracy movement in  1989, he did not think that would affect his career in the Legal  Department after 1997.    "I personally do not think it would have any effect because  most Hong Kong people supported the democracy movement at that  time." He said he took about $100,000 to students in Beijing in  an individual capacity and had not been a member of any of the  pro-democracy groups.    Joining the Legal Department will mean a drastic cut in  salary for Mr Fung and Mr Nguyen, but both said financial gains  did not rank first in their decision.    The appointment also means a breakthrough in the pace of  localisation in the Legal Department.    The slow pace has attracted much criticism and Governor  Chris  Patten promised in his policy address last year that three of  the top five law officers would be local by 1995.    "The policy of localisation which was implemented some years  back has run into difficulties, but the recent appointment--that  is mine and Mr Nguyen's--is an indication that the logjam has  been broken," Mr Fung said.    With the new appointments, 28.8 percent of the department's  directorate are locals. The overall localisation rate of the  department is 54 percent.</p>

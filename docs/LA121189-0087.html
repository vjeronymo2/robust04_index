			<p><P> December 11, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WINDS RAKE SOUTHLAND BUT MOSTLY SPARE LOS ANGELES  </P> <P> Santa Ana winds whipped through the Southland early this morning, causing havoc  on San Bernardino freeways, flooding some Orange County coastal highway areas  and blowing down power lines, but for the most part sparing metropolitan Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> The cold desert winds, which at times gusted to 80 m.p.h., created dark  swirling dust on some Inland Empire freeways, blinded motorists, flipped trucks  and pushed small cars about like toys, California Highway Patrol officials  said. More than two dozen traffic accidents were reported; however, there were  no reports of serious injuries.  </P> <P> The winds are expected to continue throughout the day and possibly worsen  tonight and early Tuesday, according to weather forecasters. Wind advisories  remain in effect for trailer rigs and other high-profile vehicles on freeways  and major highways from the western edge of the Inland Empire east to Blythe  near the Arizona border.  </P> <P> CHP officials said the winds were among the strongest they have seen this  season and predicted that the travel advisories will remain in effect until at  least Tuesday morning. The 80 m.p.h. gust was reported in the Laguna Peak area  near Point Magu in Ventura County.  </P> <P> The powerful winds made this morning's commute a nightmare for motorists in the  Inland Empire, where portions of three freeways were closed by dangerous dust  clouds that cut visibility.  </P> <P> "The traffic is heavy, the visibility is poor and down to zero in some  stretches," CHP Officer Marty Bell said in San Bernardino. "It's best to just  stay out of the area altogether if possible."  </P> <P> By noon, the CHP reported that 15 trailer rigs had been toppled by the heavy  winds.  </P> <P> One unidentified driver received scrapes and bruises after the wind tipped his  truck rig onto its side. One highway patrol officer reported that the wind blew  out the back window of his patrol car.  </P> <P> A part of California 60 was closed to all traffic due to blowing sand and  sudden gusts, while Interstate 15 was closed from Baseline Road east to the  community of Devore. A section of Interstate 10 near the Ontario Airport in  western San Bernardino County was also closed.  </P> <P> The southbound lanes of Interstate 15 near Devore were closed for several hours  because of the vicious wind gusts funneling through Cajon Pass.  </P> <P> Exacerbating the difficult driving conditions were swirling leaves and small  branches torn from trees. Sand, dust and small rocks also pelted windshields in  some areas and caused a giant brown cloud to form over much of the region by  mid-morning.  </P> <P> Another round of gusty desert winds whipsawed Orange County, ripping signs off  their posts and interrupting power to at least 16,600 homes and businesses.  Several areas of the Pacific Coast Highway were temporarily flooded by  wind-thrown waves coming off the ocean.  </P> <P> The powerful winds prompted the Orange County Fire Department to call a "red  flag alert," an extra high state of readiness to protect against threat of  wind-whipped fire.  </P> <P> The winds blew a steady 23 m.p.h. at John Wayne Airport with occasional gusts  to 35 m.p.h., the National Weather Service reported. They were even higher at  the Marine Corps Air Station in El Toro where gusts as high as 37 m.p.h. were  reported.  </P></p>

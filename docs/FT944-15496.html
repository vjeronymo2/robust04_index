			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / UK Company News: WMI rises 11% in third quarter Weak prices reined in profits growth at Waste Mangement International, the UK quoted arm of WMX Technologies of the US, which yesterday announced an 11 per cent improvement in third quarter pre-tax profits. Mr Nigel Wilson, of WMI, said the group was disappointed following a mixed third quarter performance, in spite of strong sales growth. Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 38.9m to Pounds 43.1m on sales 23 per cent ahead to Pounds 288.8m. Profits for the nine months rose 14 per cent to Pounds 125.4m on sales up 20 per cent to Pounds 831.7m. Revenue growth in the quarter was due in roughly equal measure to acquisitions and underlying volume gains. About 2 percentage points of the sales improvement was down to price increases. Mr Wilson said operating margins had slipped from 16.8 per cent to 16.2 per cent in the quarter. This was partly due to problems in Italy, which is WMI's single largest market with 26 per cent of its total sales. Municipal customers in Italy were renegotiating contracts at prices of between 10 and 20 per cent below existing arrangements. These reductions would have to be recovered through productivity improvements. The company also suffered from a poor performance in the highly competitive French market. Mr Wilson said volume at some group landfills was running at about two thirds of peak levels. WMI said it was pleased with volumes in the UK, and it was beginning to see some signs of the 'significant price increases' being talked about in UK landfill. Mr Wilson said WMI was comfortable about prospects in the UK market, even if Browning-Ferris Industries, the large US waste services group, wins its hostile Pounds 364m bid for Attwoods. Such a major force could bring 'further support for stronger regulation,' which would improve the market, the company said. In the Asia/Pacific region, WMI enjoyed good growth in Hong Kong, a higher margin business which would also benefit in 1995 from the landfill opened last week. WMI has spent Pounds 40m on 35 acquisitions so far this year. Earnings rose by 6 per cent to 7.2p for the quarter. Analysts are forecasting annual profits of about Pounds 175m this year, with significant improvements from European recovery and east Asia feeding through in 1995.</p>

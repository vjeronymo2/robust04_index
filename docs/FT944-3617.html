			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Maurice Saatchi in row over Pounds 5m share option plan Maurice Saatchi's future as chairman of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, the advertising group he founded, hangs in the balance following an explosive row between the company and leading shareholders over a proposed Pounds 5m option package for Mr Saatchi. Shareholders controlling a third of the group's shares, led by Harris Associates of Chicago, were so angry to learn of the so-called 'super option scheme' that last week they put three proposals to the company's board: That Mr Saatchi's option allocation be scaled back radically; That the company consider changing the name of the holding company, so that the 'Saatchi' brand should be used only by the operating subsidiary, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising worldwide; That the company consider whether Mr Saatchi should stand down from the board altogether, to work instead for the operating subsidiary. Last night the company refused to comment on the shareholders' action, although it is understood that its board will, in the next few days, consider the proposals. Shareholders could call an emergency general meeting if Saatchi's board does not follow their wishes. 'The option proposal was the final straw for us,' said one shareholder. 'We do not believe that Mr Saatchi's continued presence on the board is in the company's interest.' The super-option scheme, designed to reward executive directors and other senior executives, was drawn up by the group's remuneration committee, chaired by Sir Peter Walters, formerly chairman of the oil company BP and present chairman of pharmaceutical company SmithKline Beecham. It would give Mr Saatchi a Pounds 5m profit in three years, if the company's share price doubles in that period. Leading shareholders, which have been briefed privately on the scheme by the company, are furious about Mr Saatchi's allocation, because - unlike for any other executive - it is based on his old salary of Pounds 625,000, not his new one of Pounds 200,000. Mr Saatchi's salary was slashed earlier this year, following shareholder pressure, but under the scheme he would be entitled to shares worth eight times his old salary. Another element in the option scheme which angered shareholders was that Mr Saatchi would be able to exercise all his options in three years, whereas the chief executive, Mr Charles Scott, would only be able to exercise half of his entitlement at that time, and would have to wait for five years to realise the entire amount. The protesting shareholders, which collectively control 32 per cent of the shares, are four US investment institutions - Harris, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board, General Electric Pension Trust of the US, and Tiger Fund Management - and M&amp;G of the UK. Saatchi has two main international advertising networks, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising and Bates Worldwide, together with a variety of other marketing companies. Some directors, backed by the dissident shareholders, believe the development of companies such as Bates, which do not have the Saatchi name, is being held back because whenever they win a new client, the success is often described as a 'Saatchi' achievement. 'That annoys Bates's management and it also annoys clients of the Saatchi network,' said a shareholder. Demerging or selling Bates, a strategy favoured by Mr Saatchi, is opposed by many board members because they fear that it does not make financial sense. Mr Saatchi has told colleagues he will fight to preserve his name on the holding company's masthead.</p>

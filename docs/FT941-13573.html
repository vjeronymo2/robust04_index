			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Lonrho hotels stake loses Pounds 180m in value Lonrho will today disclose that the value of its two thirds holding in Metropole Hotels has fallen by around Pounds 180m - almost exactly what Libya paid for its 33 per cent stake in the hotels group less than two years ago. The fall of around Pounds 250m in the overall value of Metropole is likely to add a twist to the complicated relationship between the international trading group and the Libyan Arab Foreign Investment Company, which bought its stake for Pounds 177.5m in March 1992. Mr Tiny Rowland, Lonrho's founder and joint chief executive, believes the relationship with Libya will generate profitable opportunities for the company and should be strengthened. But his fellow joint chief executive, Mr Dieter Bock, is embarrassed by the Libyan connection and feels it hinders his attempts to encourage investment institutions to buy Lonrho shares. Lonrho will also confirm today that four close supporters of Mr Rowland have agreed to resign from the board in return for payments equivalent to two years' salary. Their departure, which requires shareholder approval because the payments exceed contractual requirements, ends Mr Rowland's 30-year domination of the company. In results announced this morning, Lonrho will disclose a fall in the value of its net assets of between Pounds 150m and Pounds 200m, largely attributable to a revaluation of the Metropole, which owns hotels in Brighton, Blackpool, Birmingham and London. Lonrho's profits for the year to September 30 are also thought to have been less than most investment analysts' estimates. Pre-tax profits including disposal gains are likely to be disclosed as more than Pounds 120m, compared with Pounds 114m, but considerably less than the Pounds 150m expected by some. Profits from ongoing businesses are thought to be less than Pounds 80m, below analysts' estimates but well above the previous year's Pounds 39m. The damage to the balance sheet from the Metropole devaluation is expected to be short-lived, since its 45 per cent shareholding in Ashanti Goldfields is believed to have a balance sheet value of less than Pounds 100m. This could be revalued to more than Pounds 400m once Ashanti is floated later this year.</p>

			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Truth of the Matter: Milton] thou shouldst be living at this hour - England hath need of thee, says Nigel Spivey, who especially commends him to David Calcutt MILTON'S Areopagitica is one of those classics of English prose more often quoted than read. 'As good almost kill a man as kill a good book.' It is packed with such proverbs and pieties of independent authorship easily quoted whenever the question of censorship arises. Yet its quotability does it disservice. It ought to have furnished principles of guidance to Sir David Calcutt: but presumably he, like the rest of us, supposed Milton to be defending the freedom of authors, not journalists; since not even their most brazen supporters would claim that any conduit of the gutter press carried 'the precious life-blood of a master spirit'. Re-reading the Areopagitica, I find that it survives remarkably well not only as the classic case for works of art to find free expression, but also a valid argument against most of the measures proposed for curbing the British press. It was written in 1644, as an explicit protest against an Order of Parliament intended to confine all printed matter to government-licensed presses. Many 'scandalous, seditious and libellous' works had been noted by Members of Parliament, 'to the great defamation of religion and government'. The legislation granted powers to the Stationers' Company to search for unlicensed presses and destroy them. Milton's reply to this was cunning in its rhetoric: he permeated his polemic with anti-Papal sentiments, likening the government licensing system to the protocol of stamping a book with an Imprimatur - 'let it be published' - and treating a grave subject with less than Miltonic gravity. He made it appear as if the legislation were so absurd that it caused even him, a committed moralist, to laugh. Behind the rhetoric, however, is a core of good sense which deserves rehearsal. The Areopagitica does not indulge the classic dilemma of liberalism. That is, it accepts the natural company of both good and evil. It does not propose a template of censorship where printed matter may be judged either proper or improper. Regulation is not a relative measure here. Government either controls the press, or it does not. If it chooses to control, then it must be consistent. Milton reminds us of Plato's system of enlightened guardians, who were thorough in their regulation. They licensed not only people's reading matter, but people's clothes, people's music, and even people's sex lives. 'Who shall regulate all the mixed conversation of our youth?' he demands. The Platonic option translates into totalitarianism: that is why newspaper editors have universally tagged the Calcutt deliberations as 'undemocratic.' Milton is not an anarchist. He believes in standards. And he admits that unlicensed printing results in the circulation of trash. But unlike Sir David Calcutt, he is not prepared to countenance legislation against trash: 'I cannot praise a fugitive and cloistered virtue.' From that, one may reasonably suppose that were Milton called to testify today, he would prefer to see his monarchs plagued by paparazzi than place themselves, in carefully chosen poses, before carefully chosen image-makers. Agreed, that preference allows shoddiness, mud-slinging and 'inaccuracies' - all the impurities to which Sir David Calcutt addressed himself - but it also allows for truth to prevail over half-truth, for gold to outweigh dross, and the preservation of justice. The onus upon those who suffer attacks from unlicensed printing is not to produce regulation, but persuasion. The false and the badly-researched will reveal themselves, so long as the powers of selection remain with the reading public, not the nabobs of some statutory council. The Miltonic attitude may seem optimistic. But it was the same conclusion reached by the Williams Report on Obscenity and Film Censorship in 1979, and Milton would be heartened by the most recent figures from the Audit Bureau of Circulations, which detail newspaper sales for June until November last year. Taking into account the influence of the recession, there are clear signs of tabloid decline. Not even an annus horribilis can sustain publications dependent upon perpetual melodrama, it seems. But most heartening to followers of Milton is the 18 per cent fall in sales of the Sunday Sport. The initial success of this paper was immensely depressing to anyone with the slightest moral intelligence: its six-month decline from 366,091 readers from June 1 to 299,477 readers in November shows an appreciable upsurge in discrimination from types one might otherwise have defined as cretins. Acceptable levels of trash. That is what Milton argued for, not only as a price worth paying for the preservation of the free spirit of enquiry, but also as a sort of moral background noise. In his words: 'That which purifies us is trial.' We recognise quality because we know what is bad; and we do not need Sir David Calcutt, or anyone else, to tell us.</p>

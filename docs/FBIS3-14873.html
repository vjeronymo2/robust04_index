			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Mikhail Shchipanov report under the "Our Commentary" </F> rubric: "Moscow Is a Port of Five Presidents"]    [Text] Boris Yeltsin's kind invitation to his colleagues  -- the presidents of the great powers -- to get together  somewhere (in Moscow, for instance) to discuss peace settlement  efforts in the former Yugoslavia has been up in the air so far.  The initiative by Moscow, which was itself customarily invited  to take part in other states' ambitious projects, has drawn a  reserved reaction. One that borders on suspicion. History  knows various sorts of congresses that were summoned by the  great of this world to take stock of the results of wars and  revolutions. Recently, however, such multilateral summits have  taken place mainly under the UN Security Council aegis. But  this time Yeltsin has invited world leaders to transcend the  cozy framework of the United Nations, to say nothing of NATO, in  order to organize a great-power get-together.    For the West, this initiative indeed is reminiscent of a  frightening specter of a reversal in Russian policy, the  renaissance of A. Gromyko's fancy idea that none of the world's  political issues could be resolved without Moscow. In the past  few years, the world seemed to have learned to do without  Moscow, which is why the latter's claims to a role in the  establishment of the world order, if read between lines, have  been recognized as excessive. This is particularly surprising  against the backdrop of behind-the-scenes promises that Russia  will attend political debates of the Group of Seven on a  permanent basis, if not become a full member of the elite world  club. Apparently, it was still important that Russia was  invited to acquire the status of a great power. This time  around it seems as if Russia were inviting them. Dances to  which ladies invite gentlemen are clearly not in vogue in the  West.    How is it that the Americans and their allies are trying to  circumvent Russia's proposal without arousing much fuss? There  are a number of options. First of all, the West would try to  speed up the emerging rapprochement between the Muslims and the  Croats, that is, between participants in the conflict on whom  Russia has only a limited influence. Hence, the idea of a  comprehensive conference that would resolve all the problems  under a package deal will die a natural death. Also possible  are "disappointing" incidents, such as yet another spy scandal,  that bring progress in Russian-American relations to naught.  Finally, the idea of such a conference, if adopted by NATO,  would have forced the North Atlantic bloc drastically to adjust  its previously adopted line of conduct based on strength.  Apparently, this would have deprived the Western alliance of  the freedom of balancing on the verge of a power solution. That  is to say, a solution the specter of which has ensured the  West's complete domination in the Balkans for a number of  months. Measures based on the use of force, such as yesterday's  downing of Serb aircraft, will entirely exclude Russia from the  Balkan concert. On the contrary, a conference would only have  fixed its place in the future system of security guarantees for  the post- Yugoslav countries.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Robert Lamb, outgoing U.S. State Department special  coordinator on Cyprus, has expressed the view that in his report  to the Security Council, the UN secretary general will declare  the confidence-building measures [CBM's] dead, and will  criticize [Turkish Cypriot Leader] Rauf Denktas for this. In an  interview with CyBC [Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation]  correspondent Apostolis Zoubaniotis, Lamb said that he has the  impression that the UN secretary general's report will be very  harsh and that to all appearances, he will terminate this round  of talks on the CBM's. The United States, Lamb added, will not  waste its time if one of the parties is not interested in  negotiating in goodwill.    According to our correspondent, Lamb who would have retired  at the end of May, was asked to remain in his duties for one  more week. Our correspondent also reports that in the next  couple of days the State Department leadership will make known  its position on the developments in the Cyprus issue. According  to a U.S. official, very few expect Denktas to give a positive  answer on the CBM's.</p>

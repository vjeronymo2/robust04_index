			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report on speech by Li Zemin, secretary of the </F> Zhejiang Provincial CPC Committee, on 6 June; place not known:  "Step Up Efforts To Crack Down on Major and Grave Economic  Crimes and Further Deepen the Anticorruption Struggle"]    [Text] Yesterday, upon the closing of a telephone  conference held by the Central Commission on Politics and Law on  making unrelenting efforts to crack down on major and grave  economic crimes, Li Zemin, secretary of the Zhejiang Provincial  CPC Committee, set guidelines for party committees at all levels  in Zhejiang on deepening the anticorruption struggle. He  stressed: We must further unify our understanding, strengthen  leadership, ensure a good job of dealing with major and grave  cases of economic crime, and deepen the anticorruption struggle,  to maintain the province's trend of reform, development, and  stability.    After noting the considerably good results that Zhejiang has  achieved in dealing with major and grave cases of economic crime  since the Second Plenary Meeting of the Central Discipline  Inspection Commission in August, Li Zemin pointed out: We  should not overestimate the results we have achieved -- some  corrupt practices are far from being effectively checked. Work  in investigating major and grave cases occurring in key  departments, especially crimes committed by leading cadres, is  still a weak link -- it still far falls short of the  expectations of the party Central Committee, the State Council,  and the masses.    Li Zemin said: The guidelines laid down by Comrade Ren  Jianxin at the telephone conference concerning stepping up  efforts to crack down on major and grave cases of economic crime  are important guidelines of the party Central Committee on  fighting corruption, especially for cracking down on grave  economic crimes. With the telephone conference as a turning  point and in conjunction with the relevant guidelines laid down  by the provincial CPC Committee and government, party  committees, governments, and public security, procuratorial, and  judicial departments at all levels of the province should  faithfully carry out the guidelines set at the telephone  conference.    First, we should further unify our understanding of the  great  significance of the anticorruption struggle. Deepening the  struggle is an important assurance for carrying out the guiding  principle of "seizing the opportunity to deepen reform, broaden  the scope of opening up, accelerate development, and maintain  social stability," as well as an important effort to strengthen  party building. We should further clear up the various vague  ideas about the struggle currently existing among a small number  of leading cadres, and correct their wrong way of doing things,  in order to bolster their anticorruption resolve and confidence.  It should be made clear that anticorruption efforts are an  important need for the economy to develop smoothly and in a  healthy manner. We should preserve cadres' enthusiasm and  initiative in carrying out reform and economic construction, but  we must never defend or wink at their corrupt and criminal acts.  Leaders at all levels, especially leading comrades of the party  and government, should restudy Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  discussion on tightly gripping with two hands and Comrade Jiang  Zemin's speech at the Third Plenary Meeting of the Central  Discipline Inspection Commission; further unify their  understanding of the great significance of the anticorruption  struggle; and carry out the struggle unequivocally, justly, and  forcefully, in order to further deepen the struggle and to  enable it to endure and yield better results.    Second, priority should be given to investigating and  prosecuting major or serious cases. Vigorous efforts should be  made to investigate such cases in key departments, especially  major criminal cases involving leading cadres. Specialized  organs should follow the mass line by encouraging people to  report on criminal cases. We should conscientiously do a good  job in preliminary investigations for clues to solve cases.  Party committees at various levels should support law- and  discipline-enforcement departments in preliminary investigations  of cases. A case that should be investigated and prosecuted  must be thoroughly investigated and prosecuted no matter who is  involved. We should resolutely resist various personal  connections and interceding for others. Interference in the  handling of a case that constitutes a crime should also be  investigated and prosecuted according to law. We should support  law-enforcement departments in handling cases independently. We  should conscientiously implement the principle of dealing  promptly and severely with serious cases involving economic  crimes. When it is necessary to make a preliminary  investigation of a case, we should do so; when a case should be  put on the record for investigation and prosecution, we should  do so; and when those involved in a case should be given severe  sentences, we should also do so. Under the unified leadership  of party committees, news media and propaganda departments  should effectively report on and publicize typical major or  serious cases in order to strengthen people's confidence in the  struggle against corruption. Conscientiously implementing the  principle of "being firm, prudent, and accurate," we should  strictly distinguish between being guilty and being innocent.    Third, it is necessary to effectively strengthen our  leadership over the anticorruption struggle and the  investigation and prosecution of major or serious cases. The  anticorruption struggle is a task for the whole party. So the  whole party should carry it out, and there should be personnel  responsible for it at every level. We should make unremitting  efforts to do solid work in this regard. We should  conscientiously analyze and check on the anticorruption struggle  according to the central authorities' requirements and the  conditions of our localities or units. We should make further  arrangements for the investigation and prosecution of major or  serious cases, especially cases involving leading cadres. We  should strengthen our supervision and inspection in this respect  and vigorously implement relevant policies and measures. We  should take the initiative in coordinating the investigation and  prosecution of major or serious cases, especially cases  involving leading cadres. All departments concerned should make  concerted efforts in handling such cases. Principal leaders of  party and government organizations at various levels should  concern themselves with the investigation and prosecution of  major or serious cases, support law- and discipline-enforcement  departments in handling cases according to law, help them remove  obstructions, and back them to handle cases impartially. It is  essential to improve law- and discipline-enforcement  departments' equipment for the investigation of cases and to  make sure that they have enough funds to handle cases --  especially enough funds to investigate and prosecute major cases  involving leading cadres.    Present at the telephone conference were Chai Songyue,  deputy  secretary of the provincial party committee and executive vice  governor of the province; Wang Qichao, standing committee member  of the provincial party committee and member of the provincial  discipline inspection commission; Si Daxiao, members of the  standing committee and secretary of the political and legal  commission of the provincial party committee; Ge Shengping,  procurator general of the provincial people's procuratorate; Lu  Zushan, secretary general of the provincial party committee; and  leaders of relevant departments.</p>

			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Arts: The Last Yankee - Theatre Arthur Miller, the American playwright who made his name with such pieces as Death of a Salesman and The Crucible in the late 1940s, early 1950s, is having a remarkable Indian summer. His excellent The Ride Down Mount Morgan had its premiere in London just over a year ago. Now comes the shorter, but equally compelling The Last Yankee which contains one of the most moving scenes I have ever seen in a modern play. More of that in a moment. First a word about the rest of the piece and the Miller style. His speciality is dialogue between fairly ordinary people, Americans who can't get on or cope as well as they would like. The Last Yankee is set in a state mental home, but there is no evidence that anyone is particularly mad - just disturbed and unhappy. There are four characters. (A mysterious fifth presence sleeps through without speaking.) Patricia (Zoe Wanamaker), a Swedish American and mother of seven, is there largely, it seems, because she is depressed by her husband's lack of ambition. A descendant of Alexander Hamilton, he prefers being a carpenter to making money. The husband (Peter Davison) is a visitor not a patient, though he too can come quite close to breakdown. If his profession reminds you of Christ, this is deliberate but not overdone. He is a saint-like figure with a lot to put up with. The pair who turn The Last Yankee into drama, however, are an older couple. John Frick, played with immense authenticity by David Healy, is a building contractor who has sold his business for, one assumes, a large sum of money. He again is a visitor not a patient; his wife, Karen, is there because she does funny things, like getting up and tap-dancing at two o'clock in the morning. In other words, her husband doesn't take enough notice of her. Much of the dialogue is inconsequential. The two men talk about the car-parking facilities and the surprisingly highstandards of the state home compared to a private institution. Miller also throws in odd facts, like the poverty of Swedish Americans when they first arrived in the 19th century, and the incidence of unsuccessful treatment for depression. Talk of money is never far away. The really stunning moment comes towards the end when Karen performs her tap-dance in the full regalia of top hat, tail coat, cane and satin shorts. Very briefly her husband is persuaded to sing 'Swanee' to accompany her. The scene comes unexpectedly and is almost over before the tears have welled up, but you will seldom see anything better on stage. Helen Burns's Karen is squat and not pretty; her humanity is overwhelming. The immaculate direction is by David Thacker. Sponsorship is by Mercury Communications.

And his  shirt, which Yuriy Luzhkov would don at games with a Russian  Government team, would invariably sport the number 9--center  forward. But last year, as a member of the Political Olympus of  Russia team, Luzhkov got the number 11. The country's No. 11  politician in terms of influence--such was the result of a  survey by the VP Service for the Study of Public Opinion and  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA (NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, 6 January 1994).    No. 11 is an outside forward attacking the rival's goal by  surprise, from the wing. There was hardly anyone who expected  that Yuriy Luzhkov, who would invariably take up a position in  the political backfield, would outrun many people. To judge by  this rating, Luzhkov has, in fact, become a part of the  government ring, which will boost or is already boosting his  political career.    In this same NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA rating for 1993 Gavriil  Popov, Yuriy Luzhkov's godfather in politics, came 32d. Yet in  1989, when the first democratically elected chairman of the  Moscow City Soviet, who had a resonance throughout the country,  adopted for the position of chairman of the Executive Committee  Yuriy Luzhkov, the latter was only head of Moscow's  Agro-Industrial Committee. He was a typical apparatchik of the  party-economic mold--a strict and pragmatic leader who was very  familiar with the municipal economy and knew how to make  efficient use of the command-administrative system.    There came to be talk in the governor general's house on  Tverskaya at that time that the Moscow City Soviet had acquired  an old bureaucratic hand. As a connoisseur of the  command-administrative system, Popov was, of course, acting  deliberately in appointing as his chief deputy a person from the  Executive Committee of the times of Grishin and Saykin. He  understood that Moscow could not be run by a democratic assembly  of citizen non-gentry intellectuals. And Popov himself, by  virtue of his stamp of character, had no great desire to busy  himself with potatoes, street-sweeping, and the water main. The  communist Luzhkov set about the job. And an old horse makes a  straight furrow.    In the Moscow of perestroyka times Yuriy Luzhkov in the  office of chairman of the Moscow Agro-Industrial Committee was a  benefactor of the co-operators since he granted permission for  their activity. A good many of them had emerged at that time,  and they rapidly inundated Moscow with fruit and vegetables. But  their demise was swift, like a ripe plum falling from the  branch--Saykin, chairman of the Executive Committee at that  time, strangled the co-operators of all possible stripes with  various sets of instructions. But many businessmen of this wave  of enterprise, who had had a chance to get rich, did not forget  Luzhkov. They are now running finance companies and banks and  constitute the elite of Russian business. Some of them have  become personal friends of Yuriy Luzhkov and his political  capital.  <H5>  From a Business Manager to a Politician </H5>   Three years ago Yuriy Mikhaylovich was saying in various  auditoriums: "I am not a politician, I am a business manager. My  job is to hold the city together." And, by and large, he has  succeeded. Luzhkov became Popov's shadow. Democratic circles  considered him one of them after he in fact opposed the  Gorbachev government in February 1991 (troops had been brought  in to Moscow to guard the Congress of People's Deputies of the  USSR at that time). The leadership of the capital permitted a  protest demonstration, and the Moscow militia protecting the  demonstrators was led by Yuriy Luzhkov personally.    The balance of power in the city gradually shifted to  Luzhkov's corner office on Tverskaya with a view of the Yuriy  Dolgorukoy monument and the Kremlin (Luzhkov still uses this  office, incidentally, although he has in an official sense grown  at least two levels)--the chairman of the Executive Committee  has become a most influential figure. With every passing day  Luzhkov acquired more power. At meetings of the Executive  Committee he would "publicly flay" officials of the city  administration and teach business managers how to operate and  even sack them. There were few who came in for any praise here,  and there were unkind, cutting words for everyone. But there was  no grumbling since Luzhkov's command style was more  comprehensible and kinder to the authorities than the clamorous  sittings of the Moscow City Soviet.    On 12 June 1991 Moscow elected not only the president of  Russia but its first mayor also. Popov and Luzhkov (he acquired  the title of vice mayor) amassed the most votes. The Executive  Committee came to be called city hall, and the Executive  Committee Presidium, the government, and Luzhkov become, in  addition, premier of the Government of Moscow.    Diarchy, which predetermined the similar development of  events at a higher level, set in in the capital (still of the  USSR at that time). But Popov and Luzhkov seized the initiative  immediately--on the eve of the elections even all retirees were  by decision of the former granted the possibility of free travel  on municipal transport. This social trump card in the  Popov-Luzhkov policy became one of the main ones, and  Muscovites' affections remained on the side of city hall through  the termination of the existence of the Moscow City Soviet.    Yuriy Luzhkov was, as before, in the shadow of the democrat  mayor. Luzhkov greatly respected him as a scholar and idolized  him even. When the vice mayor began to talk about economics, it  could be seen that the influence of Popov the economist on  Luzhkov had been enormous. But at the same time it was felt that  a resistance to these ideas was maturing in him, a resistance  born of the "actual economy" with which Luzhkov had to deal  every day--from morning until night.    Popov had it figured right. Luzhkov proved to be a workhorse  capable of tackling business all day long. He did not succumb to  despair, became involved in everything, and could calmly and  knowledgeably argue about the difficulties of the "zero" cycle  in construction, then smoothly switch to the process of the  manufacture of stuffing for sausages, and conclude the  conversation with a discussion of binder-type asphalt. Yuriy  Luzhkov would frame each subject with actual figures, and you  would believe him, although he has never prepared asphalt or dug  a foundation pit.    He would sharply cut short talk about politics. He would  knit  his brows, feeling himself to be not entirely at ease. He would  take pride in the fact that he is a man "of the soil," a  business manager, and he would, as he put it, leave "all the  chattering" to the deputies. But August 1991 threw the  "winter-swimmer" Luzhkov into the cold font of world politics.    On 24 August USSR President Mikhail Gorbachev formed the  provisional Council of Ministers of the USSR-Committee for  Operational Management of the Economy. Under the leadership of  Ivan Silayev, Luzhkov was entrusted with tackling questions of  the agro-industrial complex, trade, foreign economic relations,  and the social sphere. In practice this meant that Yuriy Luzhkov  was to secure from all the republics and krays of the  disintegrating Union supplies of agricultural products for the  "granary of the motherland" and on the strength of talk about an  acceleration of the development of democracy in the USSR obtain  from the West soft loans for purchases of that same food. As in  1987 also, almost the impossible was demanded of Luzhkov:  feeding the people by employing command-socialist methods of  management. What he did was there for all to see: in the store,  on the table.    The enthusiasm with which Yu. Luzhkov embarked on this work  astonished many apparatchiks in the Council of Ministers. It was  thought that he would break his neck. But ministerial office  afforded Luzhkov, who had in the Moscow Agro-Industrial  Committee been accustomed to extricating himself from almost  hopeless situations, merely operating room for his seething  energy.    Luzhkov's name appeared in all major European newspapers  along with those of leading politicians and businessmen.  Following a conversation with Luzhkov and Yavlinskiy, Pierre  Beregovoy, minister of economy, finance, and budget of France at  that time, said that the course of history in the USSR had  accelerated markedly. Following a visit to Warsaw, a most  important barter deal was concluded: Leszek Balcerowicz, deputy  chairman of the Council of Ministers of Poland, did not conceal  his satisfaction at the fact that in exchange for 600,000 tonnes  of potatoes, 50,000 tonnes of apples, and 20,000 tonnes of  onions, his country would receive 1.5 billion cubic meters of  natural gas. Yuriy Luzhkov himself was sober in his evaluation  of what had been done: "Yes, we could have obtained foreign  currency somewhere for this raw material. We are proceeding here  primarily from economic considerations. Poland is our closest  neighbor. Food supplies in terms of transportation costs account  for up to 15 percent and even more of the cost of the products,  but transportation costs are not that great here, and we benefit  from this."    The principle of expediency helped Luzhkov on several other  occasions to accomplish the tasks that had been heaped on him.  Sometimes this principle was dominant in the affairs of the vice  mayor, and decisions that were stillborn issued from his pen at  that time. But simple steps helped Luzhkov in the fall of 1991.    It is possible that Yu. Luzhkov's ability to negotiate with  potential partners was manifested in that same period.  Secretaries from the United States and Canada would come to  Moscow on reconnaissance, promising nothing, but subsequently,  at their direction, representatives of various companies, who  would subsequently take up residence in Moscow, would come to  Luzhkov, as a person capable of getting things done. Luzhkov  knows how to persuade people, and they believe him. Following a  visit to Brussels, to the headquarters of the Common Market, the  vice mayor acknowledged that there had been very difficult  negotiations on supplies of food to the USSR both along  humanitarian assistance lines and along the lines of prompt  credit agreements, "which are to be signed very soon." The  humanitarian assistance reached the country, there were other  supplies also--Luzhkov had not been cheated.    But some of the agreements gradually fell through as a  consequence of the West's reluctance to give money to the USSR,  now Russia. This was one of Luzhkov's first contacts with the  bureaucracy of the West.    He did everything he could and calmly returned to his office  on Tverskaya with a view of the Kremlin and the Yuriy Dolgorukoy  monument: There was no starvation in the country--Luzhkov was  able to persuade and convince even the Union republics that had  already proclaimed their independence to fulfill the agreement  on reciprocal food supplies.    It was in his office on Tverskaya that Luzhkov greeted also  the Belovezha Agreement, which undermined the political part of  the vice mayor's work. Everything had to be started all over  again.  <H5>  Yeltsin Once More </H5>   In 1992 Yuriy Luzhkov, author of the book "72 Hours of  Agony.  August 1991. Beginning and End of the Communist Putsch in  Russia," continued to be politicized, in spite of his desire not  to become involved in politics. He understood sooner than  Yeltsin what was meant by opposition of the authorities when  deputies of the Moscow City Soviet began to say that all evil  resided in the capital's government. Luzhkov made no move to  exacerbate relations. And in this connection also spoke  absolutely specifically--the contradictions were of an objective  nature. They were caused by the imperfection of the legislative  base. As a democratic society based on the rule of law was  built, these contradictions would disappear. That is, if the  Moscow City Soviet got in the way, it would soon disappear. Time  has shown that Luzhkov acted wisely: he entered via his deputies  into rearguard battles with the radical democrats and pulled  over the most clear-headed deputies into the machinery of  government. Luzhkov-Popov proteges were already holding  important city positions at this time: Yevgeniy Savostyanov,  chief of the Moscow department of the Ministry of Security of  the Russian Federation, and Arkadiy Murashev, chief of the  city's Internal Affairs Main Administration. Luzhkov himself, on  the other hand, had begun to fight the Gaydar government.  Primarily the methods of privatization propounded by chief  privatizer Chubays.    Luzhkov disliked the fact that wholesale privatization would  deprive city hall of a large chunk of property. And this, in  Luzhkov's opinion, was wrong: He remained, as before, a  supporter of gradual entry into the market.    In the old prices the property of city hall (and this means  40,000 buildings, transport, hospitals, schools, plants, and so  forth) was valued at R125 billion. Luzhkov, as a true Russian  fellow, has no wish to let anything out of his hands just like  that. And he had by his grasp achieved a great deal--a  wide-ranging social program had been initiated in the city.    On 6 June 1992 Gavriil Popov--Moscow's first democrat  mayor--resigned, and Yeltsin immediately appointed Luzhkov head  of the city. The president of Russia did not have to think long  when signing the edict, for that matter. He remembered how in  1987 Luzhkov had, as directed by B. Yeltsin, first secretary of  the Moscow City Party Committee, taken charge of the  Agro-Industrial Committee and had done a good job.  <H5>  Yuriy Luzhkov as City Planner </H5>   City planning is one of Luzhkov's passions. No, he does not  demolish roadways to build stone monuments. Yuriy Mikhaylovich  erects churches and apartment houses. When, at the end of last  year, the Chapel of the Icon of Our Lady of Kazan was opened in  Red Square, the mayor stood next to the president and was  inordinately proud of his creation. It was on his insistence  that the Government of Moscow began the elaboration of a program  of church revival and reconstruction. It is possible that at the  start of the next millennium people will once again be speaking  of Moscow as the city of "multitudes," and Luzhkov himself will  be inscribed in tablets of stone under the name of Yuriy the  Chapel Builder, although it is not absolutely clear why there  will be so many churches in Moscow in the 21st century.    It is hard to believe in Luzhkov's piety, but on grand  church  holidays he can always be found among the parishioners of the  Yelokhovskiy Cathedral. The mayor has not been spotted in a  synagogue or mosque. But since he ordered the erection of a  synagogue and mosque in Victory Park on Poklonnaya gora  alongside the Christian chapel, Luzhkov may be considered a  postcommunist ecumenist. Luzhkov gave R50,000 of his own, which  he had received from the judgment against the newspaper PRAVDA,  for the building of the chapel in Red Square.    Luzhkov cannot be reproached with a patriarchal approach or  "sour" conservatism. He found his own path to the  chapel--objective reality present in cubic meters of building  materials--and walked it with the secret thought of praying for  forgiveness for nomenklatura sins and of leaving behind fond  memories of himself. What prompts people to take this path is  depicted well by Russian literature of the turn of the 20th  century.    During a church service the appearance of our mayor holding  a  candle makes a dual impression. He is either quailing at the  sight of Byzantine splendor in the adornment of the cathedral,  when the choir hits so high a note that you yourself are  uplifted a little, or Yuriy Mikhaylovich is bored. The  reconciled nature of the atmosphere shrouds and enfeebles, and  this is none too comfortable a state for Luzhkov's active  nature. On the way out from the chapel he is probably thinking  what still needs to be built, restructured, and so forth. He is  aided in such work by a sound knowledge of the historical and  urban-planning distinctiveness of Moscow and his ability to  attract private capital for the reconstruction of buildings in  the center. And he promises, furthermore, that 250,000  Muscovites who are residents of the center will return to their  homes after their reconstruction. This will hardly be possible,  but on a historical scale this fact is immaterial.    The second direction of the activity of the city  planner-mayor "for the ages" is to be the erection of  ultra-modern skyscrapers like the Moscow City international  business center. The first billion has already been invested,  but there is, as before, still a garbage tip in the bend of the  Moscow River. Luzhkov himself has not made it here yet,  evidently.  <H5>  Corruption in Moscow </H5>   Moscow received the news of Luzhkov's appointment as mayor  without any particular joy. There was talk to the effect that  now all documents exposing officials of city hall of theft and  bribery would be destroyed. The principal unmaskers of the mafia  accused Luzhkov of all mortal sins, but then all at once fell  silent since the facts they had presented were not corroborated.  There had been similar assaults on Yuriy Luzhkov in the period  when he stood behind Gavriil Popov. At that time Luzhkov wrote  letters to the papers and appeared on television, proving his  cleanness.    Having become mayor, he started to go to law. And it has to  be acknowledged that no one has been able to prove that Luzhkov  is a thief or bribe-taker--the mayor has not lost a single case.  This has strongly added, if not to the popularity, then to the  respect for Yuriy Mikhaylovich.    A new twist was added to the spiral of the  nonprofessional-democratic "fight against corruption" following  the founding of the notorious MVK (Interdepartmental Commission  for the Fight Against Corruption Under the President of the  Russian Federation). According to confidential information, not  officially reflected anywhere, at the time of the feverish  collection of compromising material on the enemies of Boris  Yeltsin, activists of the MVK dragged out and heaped onto the  president's desk some things concerning Moscow. A person who saw  all this said that the president responded in a somewhat  irritated tone of voice, cutting the conversation short: "Leave  Moscow alone." Or something to that effect.    Looking into this incident in the Kremlin, we may say the  following: Like any important superior, Luzhkov signs many  documents, sometimes hardly familiarizing himself with them  even, trusting his aides. On a purely formal level certain  complaints could, most likely, be brought against Luzhkov, but,  first, there would still have to be proof here, and, second,  Luzhkov, as an experienced bureaucrat, senses danger in his  bones. It is known for certain that when a powerful new  commercial group attempted to blackmail the mayor with the fact  that it could prove its lobbying activity to this firm's  advantage, Luzhkov sent them further down the line,  demonstrating here that the mayor's signature has never been  appended to papers of dubious content. So the young wolves  snapped their teeth on the neck of the experienced industrial ox.  <H5>  The Mayor and the Balalaika </H5>   Yuriy Luzhkov is a man of the world. And his bowtie is an  eloquent indication of this. The mayor attends secular  receptions not from a sense of duty. He likes also to circulate  in the company of stars of the theater of the first and second  magnitudes, likes to hobnob with famous directors and  scriptwriters, and likes to appear on stage. His effervescent  nature cannot pass up the temptation to compose and deliver  pompous toasts and odes. Listening to Yuriy Mikhaylovich at the  Mark Zakharov birthday party, democratic intellectuals yawned  from boredom, but, to judge by everything, they were enveloped  by a sense of pride that the capital's mayor hangs around  museums and makes himself over to them  wholeheartedly--particularly when a specific problem needs to be  resolved. At that same party Yuriy Luzhkov took to the stage  with a balalaika (a gift to the birthday honoree) and began to  read his poem dedicated to Zakharov. At this time a cake was  carried out in back of the mayor and candles were lit in the  expectation that the mayor was on the point of concluding the  ode and kissing the birthday celebrant and that the latter, thus  inspired, would blow out the candles at one go. But Luzhkov,  rapping out his words, went on and on, speaking in rhyme: the  candles had burned out, and new ones had to be stuck in. In the  televised version this episode was by the solicitous hand of the  director reduced to one quatrain, and the result was that  Luzhkov was brief also, like Sobchak, whose speech was  reproduced in full.  <H5>  A Good Deputy Is a Satisfied Deputy </H5>   The deputies of the State Duma of Russia spent almost a week  discussing the question of how they were to live at public  expense, executing the wishes of the people. As you will recall,  the new councilmen did not short-change themselves. The deputies  of the Moscow City Duma were not offended either, but their  benefactor was Yuriy Luzhkov himself. Part of the machinery of  state was assigned to each deputy (and there are 35 of them  altogether), and good apartments are now being sought on the  quiet for the people's elect.    It is for this reason, perhaps, that there have been no rows  in the City Duma and that Moscow's councilmen, wholly dependent  on the mayor, but with no grounds for complaints about lack of  attention to them, are working productively. They voted the  deficit budget with which Luzhkov had presented them and gave  him carte-blanche for its execution. By this simple method Yuriy  Luzhkov restored working order in the law-making body and  secured his rear. And in the building on Petrovka, where the  Duma meets, renovation is under way currently in order that the  deputies might in the future also look into the city's problems  calmly and comfortably and avoid damaging democratic urges.  <H5>  Reforms Luzhkov-Style </H5>   Luzhkov understands the market economy and democratic  transformations somewhat in his own way, although he always  follows the route of purely presidential policy. Not government,  presidential. It is said that it was the mayor of Moscow who  said: Between democracy and the market we choose the market.  Luzhkov has his own economic strategy, therefore: a market  subject to the jurisdiction of the authorities, the payment of  social benefits to those who cannot earn sufficient themselves,  and the extraction from commercial structures of resources  necessary for the city, but also the opening for them of the  opportunity to develop business and, consequently, get rich.    Luzhkov is even more radical than the president on certain  political issues. Last winter, when the rights of the  Russian-speaking population came to be violated in Latvia and  Estonia, the Moscow mayor was the first to declare that, were  this to go on, all agreements between the Government of Moscow  and these countries could be annulled. The Russian Government,  and the president also, took a slap in the face.    The president remained silent when Luzhkov decided to  introduce registration conditions for residence in Moscow last  March. This innovation did not get through the first time--the  Moscow City Soviet, the Supreme Soviet, and the Public  Prosecutor's Office rebelled.    But October 1993 was the mayor's shining hour. The  regulations were put into effect during the state of emergency.  And Moscow was engulfed in a wave of xenophobia. Luzhkov was  victorious, playing the part of defender of Russian people. In  the minds of citizens not burdened by politics, the mayor's  action made a pleasing impression. Luzhkov did not justify  himself and did not repent, in public at least, nor did he  retreat from his position.    Having learned how to maneuver in current political life,  the  mayor has always tried to play his own, even if little, game.  And the presidential-government team could not put the squeeze  on him, afraid of Yeltsin, obviously. For the latter Luzhkov has  been a person capable of performing any work and keeping a firm  hold on Moscow--more than the capital, the political and  "psychological" heart of Russia.    On 23 July of last year the Supreme Soviet of the Russian  Federation Sixth Session authorized the institution of criminal  proceedings against V. Shumeyko. Everyone anticipated a noisy  scandal. It was rumored that, following the Supreme Soviet's  demand for the dismissal of the mayor of Moscow also, Luzhkov  would be sent as ambassador to Canada, out of harm's way. That  same day Luzhkov, wearing a light-gray suit, mounted the  Congress podium and said, rapping out each word: "Just you try.  It was not you who put me there. It is not your job to remove me  either." After this, the popularity of the mayor of the capital  went through the roof.    There has come to be talk as of late in the offices in  Staraya ploshchad about Luzhkov as a candidate for the office of  president. This talk has intensified even more since the victory  of the LDPR at the parliamentary elections. Yuriy Mikhaylovich  himself has not supported this talk, responding that he is  indifferent to such rumors.    He has rejected the struggle for the position of Duma deputy  or member of the Federation Council, which he could not have  lost, realizing that this would be of no interest to him and  unnecessary now also. In addition, Luzhkov knows that there is  nothing as powerful in Russia as the administrative vertical  line. In tsarist, communist, and postcommunist Russia. A  pragmatist with a flexible intellect, he sees for himself as yet  no place other than that of mayor of the capital affording him  the power to influence the domestic policy of all of Russia and  the CIS even, especially since this office and his personal  connections are helping him become a person who is well informed  as to presidential-governmental court intrigues. So Luzhkov has  become a clean politician, although such a definition seems  altogether strange.    The "cleanliness" of Moscow's streets is of no significance  here owing to the smallness of its magnitude. No one notices  this when against the background of the industrial recession the  capital's construction workers have handed over 3 million square  meters of housing, of which 1 million have been given free of  charge--to persons on the waiting list. A political step of  Luzhkov's was a slap at the falling Gaydar by an open letter to  Chernomyrdin. It dealt with preferences for Moscow in the  acquisition of food. The monetarists had prevented this. It is,  generally, all the same to Luzhkov which economic theory is  currently in vogue: He has to feed the capital.    Luzhkov is a person who adapts well to all conditions of  life, for he always tackles very specific assignments and (which  is rarely the case with others) knows how to accomplish them.  <H5>  Moscow Rumors </H5>   The capital's rumors from the highest spheres may be  evaluated by the old words "all calendars lie," but they should  not, undoubtedly, be ignored, for all that, since a computation  of them affords a depth of understanding of the processes at  work in the Kremlin's offices. As the POSTFAKTUM Agency reported  recently, three big-capital entrepreneurial parties will shortly  make their presence known. The constituent congress of one of  them--Party of the Third Estate--is scheduled for 15 February.  The purpose of the newly formed structure is nomination by the  end of this year of Mayor of Moscow Yuriy Luzhkov as candidate  for the office of president.    So all will very soon become clear. But it is perfectly  obvious that in the last week of January Yuriy Luzhkov  consolidated his positions, taking eighth place in the "100  Politicians" popularity poll, and his latest slap at Gaydar hit  home: At a meeting in Orel, Chernomyrdin allocated Luzhkov the  necessary credit for the purchase of food in the capital.  Luzhkov wins again.</p>

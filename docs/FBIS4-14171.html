			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Questions" column by 'Abdallah Nassar] </F>   [Text] Lee Hamilton, chairman of the U.S. Congress' Foreign  Relations Committee, has announced that economic aid to Egypt  will continue for one, two, or perhaps three more years. His  opinion reflects debates going on in several U.S. circles  concerning foreign aid to various countries. Because of  pressure, the volume of foreign aid is being reduced annually,  because U.S. taxpayers believe the aid serves no purpose now  that the Cold War is over.    The United States can choose any policy it wants. Any  attempts to influence it will not work because they care about  the interests of the U.S. citizen. However, why did the  announcement that aid to Egypt will stop in three years at most  coincide with U.S. attempts to block Egyptian exports to U.S.  markets? Egypt is capable of continuing its economic reform  measures without U.S. aid. If we shed some light on this issue,  we find that the United States, its employees, and companies  have greatly benefited from this aid and even shared some of it.    How can we prepare ourselves for the end of this aid? We  can, if we mobilize our enormous capabilities in various areas,  improve our products, encourage Egyptians to invest their money  and work harder, and grant preferential treatment by the state  to Egyptian investors, citizens, and businessmen.    No country in the world can exist without cooperating with  other countries, but this cooperation must be governed by rules  and conditions, so that no party may benefit at the expense of  another and no party may impose arbitrary terms or restrictions,  and this is what we should expect from now on. Aid does not  build a homeland, and Egypt is rich in resources and people.</p>

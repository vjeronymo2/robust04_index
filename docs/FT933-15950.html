			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Fear stalks Assam tea estates - A campaign of kidnapping and extortion GOODRICKE GROUP, a leading Indian tea producer with a majority of UK shareholders, made an unusual entry in last year's balance sheet - a ransom payment of Rs2m (Pounds 42,000) to a militant group for the release of a garden manager in Assam. The other tea companies owning gardens in Assam are also paying regularly to the extremists to buy peace. But unlike Goodricke they are not ready to admit it. That one company had paid Rs20m to the Bodo Security Force - an outlawed organisation representing the Bodo tribal group - to save the life of a kidnapped manager was revealed, much to the discomfiture of the company, by the Assam government. The industry takes the state government's action as a clear message that such deals should be struck to secure the freedom of other kidnapped tea managers. According to industry officials, the tea companies have been compelled to make many secret deals with the BSF and the United Liberation Front of Assam to protect the lives of their managers. They accept that the Assam government is in no position to provide security to 688 tea estates spread over 233,000 hectares (575,000 acres) but are anxious that it should not do anything which might encourage the militants in their violent campaigns. Following the killing of Mr Surrendra Paul, chairman of the Assam Frontier group, in March 1989, the owners and senior officials of tea companies have virtually stopped visiting the gardens, leaving the management to estate officials. The managers of gardens deal directly with the militants. The militants know exactly the quantity of tea produced by each garden and they calculate their financial demands accordingly. Some tea companies refuse to pay money to the militants, but they are willing to undertake development work in the areas around the tea estates. That was the response of Tata Tea, India's largest plantation company, when the BSF asked it to pay Dollars 5m for the release of a manager who had been taken hostage on April 8. But the BSF does not seem to be in a mood to listen. In the last few years, a number of garden managers, unable to cope with the pressures imposed by the militants, have taken premature retirement. And finding replacement is not easy. Industry officials admit that they are finding it increasingly difficult to 'attract talents from outside the state'. So far the production of tea in Assam has not been affected. But if the erosion of management continues, then it will have a telling effect on the industry in the next few years. Moreover, many tea companies are not spending enough for garden development work because of the uneasy situation. Besides being the largest employer in the state, the tea industry makes the biggest contribution to the exchequer. Assam accounts for nearly half India's tea production. Management confidence will be restored to some extent, industry officials believe, if the more vulnerable gardens in Darang, Borpeta and Sunitpur districts where the BSF writ runs are provided with guards equipped with modern arms. It has been tentatively agreed that while the Assam government will raise and train the protection force, the cost of maintaining the force will have to be largely borne by the industry. The government must ensure, however, that the militants do not infiltrate the force. The state government will take a few months to raise the force and post it in the gardens. In the meantime, the industry will expect the state to seek the assistance of the army to flush out the militants in the Bodo dominated areas. Two army operations in 1991 did go a long way towards taming the ULFA militants.</p>

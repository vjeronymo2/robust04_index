			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Leading Article: German face-lift Do not forget to be surprised. Yesterday's figures, showing 2.3 per cent annual growth in west German real gross domestic product in the second quarter of 1994, confirm that the German economic recovery is now well under way. Coupled with other recent data, the news has implications for the likely course of German monetary policy in the months ahead. But the contrast between this spritely performance and the many gloomy predictions at the start of the year holds a further lesson: tired old Germany can still show its European partners a thing or two. Real pan-German GDP growth for 1994 could exceed the government's own revised prediction of 2.5 per cent. Though Bundesbank officials have this week been at pains to leave the door open for further interest rate cuts, the chances of another monetary loosening appear to be shrinking. True, monetary aggregates have been better behaved in recent months, but the prospect of 2 or more per cent real growth in west German GDP this year provides little obvious reason for the bank to side-step its money supply targets once again. That figure can justify, however, a certain amount of self-congratulation. In December, the government was almost alone in hoping for even 1.5 per cent real pan-German growth for 1994: the OECD, for example, expected only  3/4 per cent, with very little of that to come from the west. What went right? Monetarists would see little mystery in recent data: excess money growth is now feeding into demand, just as they would expect. But the economy's ability to rebound so encouragingly owes as much to the stability-oriented policy of the Bundesbank as it does to monetary expansion. The bank's credibility as a guard against inflation has weathered recent knocks better than many supposed: long-term government bond yields are currently the lowest in Europe, at around 7 1/2 per cent. Given consumer price inflation of about 3 per cent, real rates of 4.5 per cent (compared with more than 6 per cent in France) may allow a return to economic form for Germany. There is plenty still to worry about: above all, a high rate of unemployment, so far little affected by this year's growth. But two things are already in place: growth through exports and, as has been true throughout most of the past few years, faster growth than seems likely in France.</p>

			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Suppliers under threat Traditional venture capital suppliers are under threat from some of the UK institutions which invest in them, says a report* from Initiative Europe, a specialist publisher in the industry. Competition is growing from other providers of finance such as banks, insurance companies and other institutions, the UK Venture Industry Review says. 'In the long term, the traditional venture capital suppliers are expendable unless they can prove they really do add value by sourcing and structuring exceptional deals,' says Antonia Millen, managing director of Initiative Europe. Venture capital suppliers must prove they are providing an efficient and cost-effective conduit between the institutions and unquoted companies, she says. The report is billed as a strategic review of the UK's venture capital industry and the structural changes that are likely by the turn of the century. One of the biggest threats is from institutions that are by-passing the venture capital funds and 'investing directly' in the unquoted sector, it says. The latest to move in this direction are Eagle Star and Sun Life which have set up their own operations, following a path trodden by Cinven and Legal &amp; General a decade ago when they developed their own in-house investment teams. There is also an increase in the number of so-called captive operations - venture capital suppliers that predominantly manage funds for their parent organisations. 'Some institutions that used to make investments via funds are increasingly saying we have learnt how to do it by co-investing and we will now do it alone,' says Millen. Often the reason these institutions contributed to funds in the first place was to learn how to invest in unquoted equity. * UK Venture Industry Review. Price Pounds 450, from Initiative Europe.

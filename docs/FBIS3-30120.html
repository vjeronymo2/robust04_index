			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 25 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa will likely launch a political shake-up next week, an  action that could weaken his political leverage and pave the way  for a split in his six-month-old administration.    Political sources said Hosokawa has decided to carry out a  reshuffle of his 21-member cabinet sometime next week, possibly  around Thursday [2 March], despite strong objections from some  of his main coalition partners.    Speaking to a group of reporters at his official residence  Friday, Hosokawa denied that he has already decided on the  timing of the cabinet reorganization.    "I have not yet considered (the timing of a cabinet shake-  up)...It is too early," the prime minister said.    At issue is whether Hosokawa will sack or remove to an  alternative important cabinet post Chief Cabinet Secretary  Masayoshi Takemura, nominally his top aide.    The sources said Hosokawa wants to take such action because  of the recent emergence of differing political ideas with  Takemura, leader of Sakigake (Harbinger), a small partner in the  seven-party coalition.    The early cabinet reshuffle is favored by two other  coalition  parties -- Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), co-headed by the  coalition's main strategist Ichiro Ozawa, and the  Buddhist-backed Komeito [Clean Government Party].    It is opposed by Sakigake, the Social Democratic Party [of  Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ], the largest component in the coalition, and  the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP).    Rivalry between the two blocs intensified this week as  Hosokawa proposed a parliamentary alliance of the ruling parties  to compete with the largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party  (LDP) in the next general election, likely to be called this  fall.    The election for the House of Representatives will feature a  new electoral system with 300 single-seat constituencies and 200  seats chosen by proportional representation.    Hosokawa's new proposal marks a departure from his  previously  stated desire to establish a multiparty system in Japan and  signals his inclination to work for a two-party system.    The two-party system is advocated by Shinseito and Komeito  but is opposed by Sakigake, the SDPJ and the DSP, which favor a  "moderate multiparty system."    The new proposal was apparently made because published media  simulations have shown that the LDP, ousted from power last  August, will dominate the lower chamber unless the ruling  parties act as one and run only one candidate in each  single-seat constituency.    The alliance proposal immediately came under fire from  Takemura, who called it "imperialistic" and "expansionist,"  leaving a deeper crack between him and Hosokawa.    Hosokawa was hit by another shock wave this week in the form  of an announcement that a rising political star and a top labor  leader have basically agreed on the formation of a new liberal  party.    The agreement was reached between Hokkaido Gov. Takahiro  Yokomichi, once dubbed "prince of the socialists," and Akira  Yamagishi, chairman of the eight million-strong Rengo labor  federation.    The accord calls for the unification of the SDPJ, Sakigake  and DSP into a "Democratic Liberal Party."    Yokomichi, elected to the lower house four times since 1969  and the governorship three times since 1983, is poised to return  to the central political stage, probably to head the new party.    Yamagishi said Japan's political parties will be molded into  three forces -- the conservative LDP, a new conservative party  and the new liberal party.    On the economic front, a high-ranking U.S. trade official  will arrive in Tokyo on Friday to resume subcabinet-level  negotiations with Japan on automobile and auto parts trade  between the two countries, informed sources said.    Jeffrey Garten, U.S. undersecretary of commerce for internal  trade, is now on an export promotion mission in Asia.    The auto and auto parts trade is viewed in Washington as the  key focus in the "framework" trade talks between the United  States and Japan.    The coming Tokyo consultations follow ruptured trade talks  in  Washington earlier this month between Hosokawa and U.S.  President Bill Clinton.    Garten is expected to reiterate the U.S. demand to set up  "objective criteria" to gauge the openness of the Japanese  market, which Tokyo strongly opposes, describing it as "managed  trade."    Important economic indicators to be released next week  include housing starts for January, a quarterly business outlook  (tankan) by the Bank of Japan, foreign currency reserves as of  the end of February and governmental fiscal 1994 economic  outlook figures.    On Monday, the Japan Sumo Association will announce the list  of rankings for the spring grand sumo tournament.    On Wednesday, a World Boxing Association (WBA) junior  featherweight title match will be held in Tokyo between champion  Wilfredo Vasquez of Puerto Rico and challenger Yuichi Kasai of  Japan.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by reporter Yang Sung-hyon: "Government's View on </F> the Carter-Kim Talks"]    [Text] The talks between Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter  and North Korean President Kim Il-song seem to have frozen the  developments concerning the North Korean nuclear issue. Whether  a "green light" will be on is not clear yet. Still, signs are  strong that a new situation is about to develop.    The ROK Government thinks the talks between Carter and Kim  Il-song will pave the way for resuming dialogue between the  United States and North Korea. Everyone seems to agree on this.  This is because the government has left open its door to  dialogue with North Korea even though it has tried to have the  UN Security Council pass a resolution on sanctions. An official  concerned said: "We have no reason to say no to the efforts to  resolve the issue through the third round of U.S.-North Korea  talks."    Still, the government is quite negative. An official  concerned said: "We know North Korea better than the United  States does. We must watch North Korea because it may change  its attitude anytime." In this way, he did not slacken his  wariness of North Korea.    The government convened a Unification and Security Policy  Coordination Council meeting, during which no decision was made.  This means the government decided to wait; it will make a  decision upon hearing explanations from Carter, who will return  to Seoul on the morning of 18 June.    The government assumes such an attitude because of its  displeasure with the United States. It seems displeased, first  of all, with the United States' attitude toward special  inspections. The government worries that the United States may  unilaterally seek to back away from the ROK-U.S. agreement to  penetrate "North Korea's nuclear past."    The results of the talks show that holding the third round  of  U.S.-North Korea talks is conditioned on "North Korea's freezing  its nuclear activities at their present level." If North Korea  expresses its position on this issue through diplomatic  channels, the third round of U.S.-North Korea talks will take  place naturally.    ROK Government officials have refrained from commenting on  the talks between Carter and Kim Il-song. This appears to be  intended to express their displeasure. If a policy concerning a  draft UN Security Council resolution on sanctions, which was  released on 16 June, without a justifiable explanation, is  changed, the trustworthiness of such policy will be questioned.  Our government seems displeased because Carter was playing the  role of more than President Clinton's special envoy, even though  the U.S. Government repeatedly insisted he was visiting North  Korea as a private citizen and even though our government  expressed its worry that North Korea might make ill use of him.    The attempt by the United States to change its policy by  taking advantage of Carter's visit to North Korea makes the  ROK-U.S. cooperation system unstable. Foreign Minister Han  Sung-chu and U.S. Secretary of State Christopher had three  telephone conversations on the morning of 17 June and discussed  the details of the talks between Carter and Kim Il-song. This  was a deliberate attempt for the United States to win an  understanding from our government and dispel our government's  worry on the cooperation system.    Anyway, our government's efforts to push for the sanctions  will likely go nowhere with making any gain. However, the  possibility is high that North Korea, as it has done so far,  will start mapping out and implement another strategy.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, April 29, RIA -- At the moment the Russian  state-operated postal service finds itself on the brink of  bankruptcy, says a press release issued by the State Duma of the  Russian Federation.    Despite 15.9 billion roubles in subsidies received from the  budget in 1993, the postal Workers paid 20 billion roubles in  taxes.    The 1994 federal budget allocates no funds at all for the  development and social needs of the postal services.    These facts were cited by Anatoliy Nazeykin, the chairman of  the Communication Workers' Union, at a meeting with State Duma  Chairman Ivan Rybkin on April 29.    Since the service is not profitable, post offices are  closing  down in many regions, with postal workers being dismissed.    Such a situation, in the view of the union leaders, may  affect the interests of the population, disrupting the regular  delivery of pensions and benefits and periodicals.    Rybkin backed the communication workers' request that the  house should consider exempting the state-run postal services  subsidised from the budget from value added tax and a special  tax on services rendered to the population, as well as from  taxes on press distribution and acceptance of international mail.    He also promised to speed up the examination and adoption of  federal laws on communications and on federal postal services.</p>

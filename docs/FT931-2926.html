			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Dutch problems cut Expamet Intl by 40% EXPAMET International, the building products and security group, yesterday announced pre-tax profits down almost 40 per cent from Pounds 7.3m to Pounds 4.4m for the year ended December 1992. The group has been hit by problems at what was its Dutch duct making subsidiary. Last June a profit warning followed the discovery of inflated profit figures at Brema-Air. The group took an extraordinary charge of Pounds 23.5m (Pounds 1.3m) consisting of losses on disposal or closure of businesses and the elimination of Pounds 17.7m of related purchased goodwill. More than Pounds 10m related to the disposal of the Dutch ducting business and APT Controls. The balance relates to three further anticipated disposals. Borrowings at the year end were Pounds 16.4m (Pounds 9.8m). Again, the increase was caused mainly by the Dutch losses but were also boosted about Pounds 3m by currency fluctuations. Borrowings in the middle of 1992 were Pounds 22.9m. Net assets at the year end were Pounds 15.4m (Pounds 21.6m). The tax charge dropped to Pounds 1.2m, compared with Pounds 2m. The figure includes an overseas element of Pounds 202,000 (Pounds 884,000). The final dividend is 1.16p giving a total of 3.25p (10.38p) payable from earnings per share down from 9.06p to 5.08p.</p>

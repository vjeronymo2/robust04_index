			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Xu Donqin (6079 2639 0530): "Providing Sufficient </F> `Grain' for Industrial Development, Anhui Leads Other Provinces  in Confirmed Mineral Resources"]    [Text] After years of arduous struggle, geological workers  have discovered over 90 various categories of minerals -- of  which 64 have their deposit volumes ascertained -- in more than  1,900 areas in Anhui, of which over 540 are found to be workable  and usable. Anhui is leading other provinces in deposit volume  of 36 minerals, including coal, iron, copper, sulfur, alum  stone, cement limestone, and bentonite with a potential value of  700 billion yuan, winning Anhui not only a spot as a leading  province in mineral deposits but also an economic superiority .    The outcome of a recent evaluation on the extent of  guarantee  that Anhui's 37 major mineral resources can provide to the  national economic construction in the year 2010 showed that the  province's 146 confirmed coal bases -- mainly scattered in areas  between Huainan city and Huaibei city -- with a deposit volume  of nearly 25 billion tonnes rank seventh in the nation and tops  other provinces in Eastern China. The close to 3-billion-tonnes  confirmed iron deposits in 92 explored iron-producing areas  representing 40 percent of the eastern China region's total,  ranking first in the region and fifth nationwide. These iron  deposits are mainly dispersed in the Maanshan, Lujiang, and  Huoqiu areas, of which deposits in Maanshan and Lujiang account  for 52.4 percent of the provincial total. It is estimated that  additional potential iron deposits throughout the province may  reach 1.2 billion tonnes. Confirmed copper deposits also rank  fifth in the nation and second in eastern China region, mainly  concentrated along the Chang Jiang River, of which deposits in  Tongling, Wuhu, Guichi, and Anqing alone account for over 83  percent of the provincial total. Additional potential copper  deposits are estimated to be 160 percent more than the existing  known figures.    What is particularly gratifying is that, of all the  confirmed  mineral deposits, 55 categories are concentrated along both  sides of the Chang Jiang River, representing 60-100 percent of  total deposits of the same minerals across the province.  Besides iron, copper, and sulfur, cement limestone is also a  major mineral resource along the Chang Jiang River, with  confirmed deposit volume reaching 3.48 billion tonnes in 72  explored areas throughout the province. Ranking fifth in the  nation and representing about 80 percent of the provincial  total, these cement limestones are primarily scattered along the  Chang Jiang River and in Chaohu Prefecture. Anhui's rich and  diversified mineral deposits have provided an effective resource  guarantee for its economic development.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Nechayev] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 24 TASS--Russian Deputy Foreign Minister  Sergey Lavrov will evidently replace Yuliy Vorontsov as Russian  U.N. chief delegate if the latter is approved as ambassador to  the United States.    A high-ranking official at the Russian Foreign Ministry who  refused to be identified, told ITAR-TASS on Friday that "the  Vorontsov-Lavrov link continues to operate". Lavrov is now in  New York. Talks that Lavrov may replace Vorontsov at his post,  started last year for the first time.    Lavrov's possible appointment will complete a series of  planned reshuffling among Russian leading ambassadors. Russian  First Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoliy Adamishin will evidently  replace Boris Pankin in London while Vorontsov will most likely  go to Washington to occupy the post held by Vladimir Lukin, the  present chairman of lower house Committee on International  Affairs.</p>

			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / International Company News: Housing arm helps lift WestLB profits GROUP operating profits at Westdeutsche Landesbank rose by nearly a quarter last year, the large German public-sector bank reported yesterday. But stripping out the effects of integrating a subsidised housing subsidiary for the first time - and the income from the bank's own account trading activities - 'partial' operating profits were up only slightly over the DM780m (Dollars 487m) made in 1991. The bank pointed put that the rise in total group operating profits, to DM1.16bn last year from DM960m in 1991, was strongly influenced by the integration of Wohnungsbauforderungsanstalt des Landes NRW (WfA), acquired from the government of North-Rhine Westphalia at the beginning of last year. Total operating earnings - which include the contribution from own account trading - would have risen by 10 per cent without the contribution from WfA, WestLB said yesterday. Reflecting the effect of a 17 per cent increase in staff costs, partial operating profits - which exclude own account trading results - rose by 11.8 per cent from DM637.3m to DM719.5m. WestLB said most of this rise was due to WfA. Total assets of the group rose 17 per cent to approximately DM270bn, consolidating WestLB's position as one of Germany's top three or four banks in terms of balance sheet size. The contribution to assets from WfA was DM14bn, the bank said. 'Even if we disregard the special effect of the WfA integration, we were able to stabilise the positive development of our operating result, despite the unfavourable interest rate scenario,' commented Mr Friedel Neuber, chief executive. He said this would be helped through the bank's recent expansion in the state banking sector. WestLB, the state bank for North-Rhine Westphalia, recently took a 37.5 per cent stake in the Mainz-based Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz.</p>

			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHEVARDNADZE CITES OTHER NATO FORCES AS A COMPLICATION  </P> <P> Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze declared Wednesday that French  and British forces stationed in West Germany could complicate President Bush's  proposal for cutting U.S. and Soviet troops in Europe to equal levels.  </P> <P> Shevardnadze's comment, made as he left Paris on his way home to Moscow, fit  with several other Soviet warnings that finishing the conventional arms talks  in Vienna on the accelerated schedule suggested by Bush would prove extremely  difficult.  </P> <P> Shevardnadze, while again welcoming Bush's initiatives in general, described  himself as "pessimistic" on the swift U.S. timetable put forth Monday in  Brussels.  </P> <P> "I wish to point out that British and French forces in West Germany represent  100,000 men, and this disturbs the balance," Shevardnadze added, indicating one  reason for his caution.  </P> <P> Britain and France are part of the 23-nation conventional disarmament talks  under way in Vienna. Their troops in West Germany have been expected to be  included in the talks, as have the troops of Soviet allies in Eastern Europe.  </P></p>

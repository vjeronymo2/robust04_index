			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Andrey Afanasyevich Kokoshin, Russian </F> Federation first deputy minister of defense, by Pavel  Felgengauer, date, place and occasion not specified, under  rubric "Opinions": "Andrey Kokoshin: Russian Army Is Preparing  for Local Wars and Antiterrorist Activity"]    [Text] Andrey Kokoshin is first deputy minister of  defense of the Russian Federation. He was born in 1945 and  completed Moscow Higher Technical School imeni Bauman in 1969.  He has an electronics engineering diploma and is a doctor of  historical sciences, professor, and USSR (Russian) Academy of  Sciences corresponding member. He is the author (or coauthor) of  12 books on problems of international relations, military  strategy, and questions of arms limitation and disarmament. For  a number of years he held the post of deputy director of the  USSR Academy of Sciences USA and Canada Institute and deputy  chairman of the Committee of Soviet Scientists. At the same time  (as is true of many other associates of the USSR Academy of  Sciences), he took part in a number of projects financed by the  Ministry of Defense, particularly in developing the "asymmetric"  Soviet response (familiar from Gorbachev's words) to the U.S.  SDI Program.    In April 1992 Kokoshin was appointed first deputy  minister of defense of Russia simultaneously with General  Grachev (duties of Russian Federation minister of defense were  being performed at that time by President Yeltsin personally).  The "Democratic Russia" movement, influential at that time,  tried hard for (and achieved) the appointment of a civilian  specialist to a leadership position in the Ministry of Defense.  By the way, Andrey Afanasyevich himself has not taken part in  quarrels of recent years and is not directly linked with a  single political movement.    In the Ministry of Defense Kokoshin above all handles  questions of military-technical development and relations with  the military-industrial complex.    [SEGODNYA] As a Ministry of Defense representative, you  took part in organizing the successful operation in the North  Caucasus in December of last year which ended with the freeing  of captured hostages, the helicopter and its crew, arrest of the  terrorists and return of the bulk of the ransom paid to them.  Tell me, was the Army's participation in antiterrorist  operations an improvisation? To what extent was everything  planned in advance?    [Kokoshin] In principle, hostage-taking is a  regular situation for the MVD and other security services, not  for the Armed Forces. And they played the leading role in this  operation, but the Ministry of Defense was immediately drawn  into it inasmuch as the bandits demanded a military helicopter  with crew. As first deputy minister of defense, I was included  in the state commission, which as you know was headed by First  Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets. Minister of Defense General of the  Army Pavel Grachev gave directions for using any necessary Armed  Forces assets to assist MVD entities in conducting this  operation. A three-level crisis management system was  established: 1) an interdepartmental commission at the level of  the first and second persons of the Ministry of Defense, MVD,  FSK [Federal Counterintelligence Service], FAPSI [Federal Agency  for Government Communications and Information], Ministry of  Health and others, which worked for three days in Soskovets'  office; 2) operations staffs in each of the departments  participating in the operation, including a special operations  team on the General Staff and in the Main Commissariat of the  Air Force; 3) and an operations staff in Mineralnyye vody headed  by General Chebotarev from the MVD. Lieutenant General Vladimir  Mikhaylov, 4th Air Army commander, was appointed Chebotarev's  deputy. He was almost constantly in contact with the abductors.  The fliers--pilot Valentin Padalka (squadron commander, Military  Unit 32982) and navigator Vladimir Stepanov (flight  pilot-navigator, Military Unit 32982) were from his army and he  of course felt responsible for them both from a human standpoint  and out of duty. Commander-in-Chief Air Force Colonel General of  Aviation Petr Deynekin was at his post around the clock. The  fliers, from the CinC to the ordinary pilot, demonstrated their  traditional cohesiveness.    [SEGODNYA] How do you assess the level of coordination  of actions of different departments in this operation?    [Kokoshin] The Armed Forces conducted a kind of  forced exercise within the scope of the overall operation. It  must be said that in the final account good coordination of all  branches and combat arms of the Armed Forces, Internal Security  Forces, militia, and security entities managed to be achieved.  General Mikhaylov and the North Caucasus Military District  command functioned excellently. But the main burden of the  operation fell on the shoulders of internal affairs entities.    There were of course also rough spots in coordination and in  work in outlying areas, but our comrades in arms, including  First Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs General Yegorov, a  most experienced person in these matters, assessed the level of  mutual understanding very highly. To a considerable extent this  was a result of the very effective work style of Oleg Soskovets,  head of the interdepartmental commission, and of constant  support on the part of the president and prime minister.    The criminals' very first steps permitted us to determine  with a high degree of probability that they were not planning to  fly to Iran, but still the government contacted Iranian  authorities through Ministry of Foreign Affairs channels, and  they were ready to receive the terrorists in accordance with  requirements of international law.    Several possible landing areas in the North Caucasus were  computed based on the helicopter's capabilities and an analysis  of operational data received in various ways. Up to 49 different  radars were operating in the region to track the helicopter with  the abductors in the concluding phase of the operation. Ground  Troops mobile SAM system radars capable of detecting low-flying  targets were activated as well, but ground radars sometimes lost  the helicopter in folds of mountainous relief difficult for  radar operation. Then the decision was made, probably for the  first time in world practice of such operations, to bring in two  A-50 radar early-warning aircraft (similar to the U.S. E-3A of  the AWACS system). By the way, only two countries in the world,  the United States and Russia, presently possess such means with  high characteristics of their own development and production. By  this time the ground radars, tied into a unified system, also  began to work more effectively.    This system operated intermittently in the initial moment of  radar tracking of the helicopter. The A-50 aircraft were moved  from another region with an entirely different terrain relief,  and the operators initially had a difficult time. Coordination  among all radar monitoring crews was not adjusted right away,  but in the final account a reliable system for monitoring air  space in the region managed to be created through joint efforts  of the Air Force, Air Defense Troops, and the North Caucasus  Military District command, and not once during the last flight  from Mineralnyye vody to Makhachkala did the A-50's, ground  radars and specially scrambled interceptors lose "sight" of the  helicopter with the criminals aboard. And this was done in very  short time periods under standards of the armed forces of any  country. The helicopter repeatedly descended to a height of 50 m  and lower at the criminals' demand. They took extreme risks, and  only the supreme expertise and courage of "Afghan" Lieutenant  Colonel Valentin Padalka and his partner saved everyone from  perishing.    Air defense fighters and the attack aircraft brought in for  the operation had high-intensity illumination flares aboard  which could facilitate a search for the criminals at night.  Necessary aircraft weapons also were ready. By the way,  everything was prepared to the maximum extent to seal off all  possible landing areas by personnel of Internal Security Forces  and the militia, and several Airborne Troops "Spetsnaz" teams  were in full readiness (with helicopters). On the whole, forces  had been assembled which would have established a double cordon.    As a result, not only were the children freed and criminals  arrested, but a large part of the ransom also was returned.    [SEGODNYA] How new is a helicopter hijacking situation  in world practice?    [Kokoshin] According to information received,  including from foreign agencies through the Foreign Intelligence  Service, helicopter hijackings are a relative "innovation" of  terrorists, and so responding actions by law-protection agencies  have not been worked out hardly at all in world practice  compared with experience in the case of aircraft hijackings.    [SEGODNYA] Were any kind of military-technical  innovations used in this operation?    [Kokoshin] We brought in many such innovations.  The A-50's gave a good account of themselves in particular. The  A-50 in itself of course is not a new aircraft, but its  electronic "filling" is constantly being upgraded. Certain  special electronic assets also were used. Many were delivered to  Mineralnyye vody quickly, both from various security services as  well as from the Armed Forces. The General Staff Main  Intelligence Directorate also made its contribution. But much  remained in reserve.    [SEGODNYA] To what extent can the North Caucasus  operations serve as a model for future antiterrorist  operations?    [Kokoshin] The results of this operation are being  generalized now. The government assigned [us] the task jointly  with the MVD and Federal Counterintelligence Service to create  type instructions or a type plan of action in situations of a  similar nature for different regions of the country so it is not  necessary to improvise each time. Unfortunately, the overall  situation in the country is such that interdepartmental  antiterrorist plans backed up by appropriate tactics of combat  operations are extremely necessary today.    [SEGODNYA] There really is a great likelihood of  stepped-up terrorism and of the appearance of new centers of  inter-ethnic conflicts and local wars on the territory of Russia  and near its borders in nearby foreign countries. What weapons  will the Russian Federation Armed Forces need in the new  situation?    [Kokoshin] On 19 January of this year basic  directions and priorities of a long-range program for arming the  Russian Army were approved at a Security Council session.  Low-intensity conflicts and local wars in which far from mass  armies will take part are among the most likely kinds of armed  conflicts. This also was reflected in provisions of Russian  Federation military doctrine. Obviously such an assessment also  goes for the new kind of operations--fighting terrorism. We have  a three-stage program designed up to the year 2005 for the  fighting man's personal gear and equipment and combat  outfitting, which envisages different levels of outfitting from  the motorized rifleman to officers of special reconnaissance  subunits. Units of mobile forces earmarked for immediate or  rapid reaction will be reoutfitted on a priority basis.    Individual operational data display systems are being  developed: Liquid crystal displays built into a helmet, where a  fighting man will precisely see his position and that of the  neighbor and the enemy, i.e., he will receive his own "portion  of the information" on the situation around him. New types of  assault weapons have been developed for "Spetsnaz" troops and  also new kinds of combat clothing. It is very important that the  armament program provide for upgrading the communications and  tactical command and control systems. This means above all  near-real-time transmission of data, communications among  subunits according to the principle of a cellular telephone  network (but with necessary and automatic scrambling of verbal  information being transmitted), and the classic "commander's  communications." We already have systems for precise topographic  tie-in of subunits to the terrain using satellite navigation  systems. True, the individual fighting man cannot be outfitted  with that system for now inasmuch as satellite communications  ground elements have considerable weight-size characteristics  and are very costly. The first individual systems of this nature  evidently may appear only after the year 2000.    In the overall scope of military-technical tasks, the  Ministry of Defense envisages priority development of various  precision weapon systems, from close combat systems to  operational-tactical and strategic systems. There is a program  for tieing reconnaissance, data transmission and communications  systems of various levels and purposes into a unified  information system. The predominant content of the effect  exerted on the enemy in modern warfare has become not  pulverizing his personnel, but throwing command and control and  SIGINT systems into disarray and generally demoralizing troops,  the command element, and state command and control entities. By  virtue of this, EW equipment development programs become even  more important, both for suppressing enemy electronics and  weapons and for protecting our own weapon systems and data  collection and transmission systems. Today supremacy of the air  waves is at the very least equivalent to the factor of air  supremacy in wars of the middle of the century, and in many  cases today EW is no longer a secondary means. A new concept,  the electronic-fire strike, has appeared. Modern EW assets are  capable not only of "blinding" the enemy for a certain time  interval, but also putting some of the most important elements  of his systems completely out of commission.    [SEGODNYA] What are the main directions in development  of strategic nuclear forces?    [Kokoshin] This is the topic of a special  conversation requiring its own place in print and time to cover  all problems caused by the present geopolitical situation. But I  will answer briefly that in deployment of strategic nuclear  deterrence forces we are placing more and more emphasis on  upgrading the battle management system with respect to improving  its reliability, and the same thing goes for the missile attack  warning system.    [SEGODNYA] To what extent are the "Basic Directions"  approved on 19 January supported by budget financing?    [Kokoshin] This is a tough question. Prices on raw  materials, equipment and basic supplies are continuously rising  in the country, transportation costs are increasing, and  expenditures for communications services, for paying the labor  force, and so on are growing. As a result, the cost of  fulfilling any kind of program is almost impossible to plan  precisely. Many economists assumed the situation would stabilize  on reaching the level of world prices, but in many instances now  our copper, aluminum and silicon, for example, are being sold at  a price considerably above the world price. For the second year  the Ministry of Defense has not been financed as befitting a  major state client of "goods and services" making up the basis  of effectiveness and efficiency of any country's foreign and  defense policy. And it is not just a matter of volumes, but also  of the financing mechanism. In 1993 the Ministry of Finance  allocated funds to us 56 times, while in previous years they  would be allocated once every two months and in fully specific  amounts. Therefore, we are forced to plan different scenarios  for fulfilling defense programs in a rather wide range of  pessimistic and optimistic assessments of the development of  Russia's economy.    On the whole, the majority of weapon development and  production programs now are delayed in connection with the  shortage of financing. At the same time, through internal  maneuvering of modest resources we are attempting to move  priority work forward, especially in development of battle  management [and] communications systems, above all at the  tactical level. We also are trying to finance the development of  EW assets on a priority basis. The fact is, one has to pay in  blood for shortcomings in communications and command and control  systems.    It is very difficult to concentrate and maneuver funds today  as never before. It is obvious that science-intensive industries  must be saved first of all, but more often than not this enters  into contradiction with the need to maintain sociopolitical  stability in society, inasmuch as the more sophisticated  production is, the fewer workers there are in it. Ordinary  plants of the former military-industrial complex in which tens  of thousands of engineering-technical personnel and workers are  employed, where the production capacities have not been utilized  for several years in a row now, and where latent unemployment is  growing may remain essentially without budget financing. It  often happens that wages of a considerably larger number of  workers than strictly needed for manufacturing defense products  are paid through a defense order. Accordingly, earnings turn out  to be low.    [SEGODNYA] At a 29 December press conference last year,  Minister of Defense General Grachev stated that "new  mobilization plans must be made up by the end of 1994 (in  connection with changes in the situation) in the Ministry of  Defense system and in other departments." What are the basic  principles of the new mobilization program?    [Kokoshin] Back at the end of 1992 the government  significantly reduced mobilization assignments for many  enterprises at our suggestion. Now a further correction of plans  for mobilization deployment of industry is under way, naturally  in the direction of their reduction.    [SEGODNYA] But perhaps mobilization plans in industry  are not needed at all? In the majority of western countries such  plans either are entirely absent or they are of an extremely  limited nature.    [Kokoshin] What do you mean?! I still can agree  concerning the second part, but with respect to absence, I have  not yet seen a different scheme in any militarily developed  power which could replace the system of planning and  consequently management of mobilization readiness. At this  stage, planning mobilization capacities not only fulfills tasks  of preserving and modernizing Russia's defense potential, but it  also is a component part of national industrial policy. There is  a special line in the defense budget for which the Ministry of  the Economy is responsible, but nowhere have military  departments ever been unconcerned about this line of budget  appropriations. By the way, very modest funds go for this.    Today we are running up against the need for a radical  revision of principles of forming mobilization plans for  industry. A multipolar power structure of a world magnitude has  been forming since the Cold War. For now this process contains a  mass of military-political and geostrategic uncertainties for  Russia and neighboring countries. The adopted military doctrine  reflects realities of today and of the transition period. New  mobilization plans are being formed for this doctrine.    The likelihood of a major war is minimal in this stage, but  this does not mean it must be completely excluded from possible  threats to the security of Russia and its allies.    [SEGODNYA] Then just who specifically decides the  question of the complete and final closing of a particular  defense plant or production?    [Kokoshin] The government makes the decision on  closing a particular military production. The Ministry of  Defense cannot decide such a question independently, but of  course it is an interested party, as is any consumer of products  and services. In fact, everything is decided in the process of  forming and distributing the defense order within the framework  of the allocated budget and in selecting the manufacturer of  products needed by the Ministry of Defense.    Generally this is a complicated, painful problem. For  example, a government decision was made previously that the  defense state order for 1994 and for the subsequent two years  will remain at the 1993 level. But now we have received  instructions to make an additional correction, inasmuch as  keeping the state order at the 1993 level under conditions of a  further drop in the level of the GNP and of industrial  production will signify an increase in the proportion of the  defense order, which the government cannot undertake. You can  imagine what a wave of problems again faces us.    [SEGODNYA] Tell me, has the problem of the debt for the  1993 defense order been resolved?    [Kokoshin] The state debt to the Ministry of  Defense was almost 15 times greater by the end of 1993 compared  with 1992 (in prices comparable with 1992). As a result, a very  serious situation was created in the defense complex, (as in  many other sectors of the economy). It is clear that it is  necessary to change the system of financing defense needs. The  Ministry of Defense made a set of specific proposals to the  government. The main task is to preclude such an abnormal  phenomenon in the future.    Today, I view this problem with somewhat greater optimism  than before. The government is engaged in seeking specific  solutions in earnest, and a special working group has been  formed.    [SEGODNYA] Is your optimism connected with the  resignation of Boris Fedorov?    [Kokoshin] In no way. Why translate everything  into personalities? It is not a matter of the personality of a  particular appointed person (although this also is of  significance), but of following a sensible financial policy. We  must not issue subsidies and credits according to the principle  of "something for everyone" [literally, "a set of earrings for  all sisters"], with more going to the one who is more impudent  or is closer, which, by the way, often was done even with the  tightest monetary practice. We must extricate the productions  vital to the country element by element and not pay off debts to  all in succession, but above all to competitive sectors which  subsequently will be able both to earn a living themselves and  to allow others to earn one. In particular, I am a proponent of  helping the aviation and space industries, although  unquestionably there are many excess capacities there which must  be reoriented. Here we are competitive: Labor productivity in a  number of our rocket industry productions is 30 percent higher  than in the United States, in experts' estimates.    It makes no sense to finance all sorts of sectorial  scientific research through the Ministry of Defense such as  superpowerful lasers, neutral particle accelerators and other  exotic projects about which it is unknown when they will be able  to become weapons. And if we do continue them, then we must do  so from funds being allocated for basic science and exploratory  research or from internal sectorial sources of financing. Today  the Ministry of Defense has money only for a limited number of  real weapons, and that means the entire defense order and all  budget defense financing should be concentrated in the Ministry  of Defense, not scattered to other departments as was the custom  in Soviet times. We now coordinate joint programs with the  Ministry of Science, with the State Committee for the Defense  Industry (I would like it to be done more vigorously), with the  MVD, with the Federal Counterintelligence Service, and with the  Border Guard Troops.    [SEGODNYA] It turns out that the Ministry of Defense is  objectively interested in reducing the overall number of  military enterprises in order to have a concentration of ready  money instead of its present dissipation?    [Kokoshin] We are interested in a radical  structural reorganization of industry and in a sharp increase in  labor productivity. The cost system of military production keeps  dragging us to the bottom. An improvement in economic conditions  of defense enterprises clearly is needed in a large number of  cases. The question of a reduction in social infrastructure of  defense enterprises is an acute one.    [SEGODNYA] What is the destiny of the Russian (Soviet)  stealth aircraft (F-117 analogue)? Insofar as I know, the first  tests of flying prototypes of such aircraft were held back in  the 1980's?    [Kokoshin] Well, within limits of what is  permitted, I will attempt to set forth my own viewpoint as a  scientist with a basic technical engineering education, adjusted  to a certain extent by my present official position. Let us  begin by saying that two basic ways for developing stealth  technology can be traced today: Either make an invisible  aircraft or an invisible winged missile, which is both cheaper  and preferable, although the development of radar acquisition  equipment shows that absolute invisibility is unattainable in  principle. By the way, our newest radars and other electronic  equipment have no problems detecting "invisible" U.S. aircraft,  and at rather long ranges.    It is also unquestionable that certain other countries are  fully capable of adjusting the production of similar detection  equipment or modernizing old equipment within a certain time,  and others can purchase it, let's say, for petrodollars. Mass  creation of "invisible" aircraft will be expensive. At the same  time, it is possible to reduce "visibility" of conventional  aircraft by less costly methods and thereby considerably improve  their combat effectiveness.    [SEGODNYA] In developing the new main F-22 fighter the  Americans undertook to make it more "invisible" through a  degradation of performance characteristics...    [Kokoshin] In the newest military technologies of  a practical nature it is always necessary to sacrifice  something; the question is just what to sacrifice. For us,  performance characteristics traditionally have been the holy of  holies, although maneuverability is not always the dominating  value in modern aircraft construction. The capability of an  aircraft to counter enemy precision weapons and itself employ  such weapons is more important. This is achieved by EW assets.  Such is the possible "asymmetric" answer to the challenge of the  rather promising stealth technology.    There are no "cheap" weapon programs in principle, but we  will have to seek more refined and at the same time more  economical solutions based on the country's capabilities. The  world has countries that are highly developed, medium developed  and poorly developed in the military-technical sense. One's own  set of weapons is needed in case of a conflict, depending on the  enemy's level.</p>

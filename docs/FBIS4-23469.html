			<p>BFN     [Text] In Bengo Province UNITA [National Union for the  Total Independence of Angola] soldiers tried to seize a number  of government positions, paying dearly for their adventure. In  three attacks and in one clash with the FAA [Angolan Armed  Forces] between 13 and 30 May, UNITA abandoned 71 killed on the  ground, and four of its men were captured. The FAA captured 60  AKM's, four PKM's, two 60-mm mortars, one RPG-7, one antitank  missile, 82,000 rounds of ammunition of various caliber, and  other military equipment. Seven UNITA soldiers turned  themselves over to government forces during the same period.  They revealed that right now UNITA intends to recapture the  locations of Ucua and Gombe and to destroy the bridge over the  [name indistinct] river. The FAA has already taken measures to  deal with the situation.</p>

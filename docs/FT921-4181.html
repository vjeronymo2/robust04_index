			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Comment): Limits of the new consensus MR LAMONT has presented a budget that reflects the new policy consensus, but possesses a number of clever touches. He has, in the end, bribed the electorate much less than some hoped and others feared. But the main reason for his frugality, the UK's rapidly deteriorating fiscal position, should give all observers pause. The chancellor has played the ERM game by the book, the result being a deeper recession than foreseen and a worse fiscal position than the pessimists feared. All now depends on the reward for this disinflationary virtue. Without the recovery now forecast by the Treasury, the UK is heading for a serious fiscal crisis. But, alas for Mr Lamont, even if that recovery arrives, its benefits may accrue to the opposition. As recently as November's Autumn Statement, the Treasury forecast growth of non-oil gross domestic product at minus 2 1/4 per cent in 1991, followed by plus 2 1/4 per cent in 1992. These figures have now been reduced to minus 2 1/2 per cent and plus  3/4 per cent, respectively. Thereafter, things are supposed to get better, with growth at 3 per cent in the year to the first half of 1993 and 3 1/2 per cent thereafter. But this is not the first time the Treasury has claimed that things would soon improve. The recession has had one great benefit. Infla-tion has fallen sharply and will continue to do so. By the end of this year retail price inflation is expected to be down to 3 3/4 per cent. By 1996-97, the Treasury foresees the broadest measure of inflation running at Germanic levels of 2 per cent a year. Along with real GDP growth of 3 1/2 per cent per annum, this would seem to be the British equivalent of economic nirvana. Unfortunately, old British problems are likely to experience several reincarnations before then. With the public sector borrowing requirement expected to be Pounds 14bn this year (up from the Pounds 10 1/2 bn forecast in November), the fiscal position is sliding alarmingly. Next year's PSBR of Pounds 28bn - after the proposed net tax reductions of only Pounds 1.5bn - is worse than the city consensus. With privatisation receipts put to one side, the PSBR is forecast to be just under 6 per cent of GDP in 1992-93. In 1993-94 it will be just as bad, with the improvements now forecast for subsequent years depending on a sustained period of above trend economic growth. Even so, the Treasury is no longer forecasting a return to a zero PSBR within the forecasting horizon. Should growth prove to be as constrained by ERM membership as some fear, tax increases are inevitable. That outcome depends on the British consumer, on the one hand, and the German wage bargainer, on the other. The chancellor insisted that recovery is dependent on the behaviour of the private sector. He is right. But the most important private sector is the German and the institution that will channel its response is the Bundesbank. Given the fiscal picture, Mr Lamont could do little but be cautious. Even so, he may not be able to get the interest rate cut he would like. But he has at least devised changes in the fiscal structure that the Labour Party cannot readily attack. Car tax is an anomaly. The chancellor was right to halve it, though still greater increases in excise duty on petrol would have been an appropriately green offset. The chancellor's determination to raise excise duties by at least the rate of inflation - and more for leaded petrol and tobacco - is also commendable. The Business Expansion Scheme was little more than a subsidised property play. Its day was past. And the decision to remove the bias in favour of direct share ownership in PEPs was overdue. Business hoped for help, which the chancellor decided to give in the form of further transitional relief on the Uniform Business Rate. Meanwhile, Advance Corporation Tax remains unmodified, its payers unmollified. But Mr Lam-ont was right to eliminate the male chauvinism of the married couples allowance and wise to avoid the politically correct error of introducing a generalised relief for child care. The centre piece of the budget, however, is the stealing of Labour's political clothes. The new 20p lower rate of income tax is what the Labour party has said it wants, even though it is far from the best way to help the poor. Should the Labour party commit itself to reversing the reduction, it will be damaging many of its own supporters - just what Mr Lamont wants. He presents the new lower rate as an earnest of the intention to move to a new basic rate of 20p, a point on which Labour will disagree. It is here, on the choice between Mr Lamont's carefully targeted tax cut and the Labour Party's proposed expenditure and tax increases that the electoral battle will focus. This is the Budget of a chancellor constrained by the disinflationary consensus. Mr Lamont has given the opposition few clear points of attack, except over the state of economy. Even here the Labour party offers the same policy. If the budget reflects the new consensus, its economic fruit looks likely to remain untasty for some time. This budget does nothing to change that dismal fact.</p>

			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Thorp set to receive go-ahead this week A decision allowing the Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield, Cumbria, to go ahead is expected within 48 hours. Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, and Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister, have been meeting for weeks to decide how to reduce the risk of environmental groups persuading the courts to overturn the decision. Greenpeace, the pressure group which has most vigorously opposed the Pounds 2.8bn plant, has said it will apply immediately for a judicial review. The government is expected to tell British Nuclear Fuels, the plant's owner, that it can begin operating Thorp within weeks. The delay is intended to give time for a legal challenge. Ministers have been under pressure to announce a decision before parliament goes into recess at the end of this week. Pressure on the government will come as politicians from Japan, the UK and US urge the government not to allow the plant to start. Forty-two members of congress and parliament from the three countries have written to Mr John Major, the prime minister, urging the project's cancellation. Their letter was also sent to Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, prime minister of Japan, whose nuclear utilities are Thorp's biggest customers, and to President Bill Clinton of the US, which supplied much of the fuel used in the Japanese nuclear reactors. The letter says: 'The start-up and continued operation of Thorp necessarily will result in a large stockpile of plutonium, contravening the stated policies of Japan and the US.' Members of the US Congress have been urging Mr Clinton for months to step into the Thorp debate. The administration has said it believes that continued production of plutonium is not justified on economic or national security grounds. Thorp is expected to produce about 60 tons of plutonium over the next decade. Among those signing the letter were Senator Dale Bumpers, Congressman Joseph Kennedy and Congressman Pete Stark in the US, Mr Tadatoshi Akiba and Mr Tatsukuni Komori in Japan, and Mr Tony Benn in the UK.</p>

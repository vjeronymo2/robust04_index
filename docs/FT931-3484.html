			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (32): Small screen, but big ideas TOM PETERS has been the most popular (if also most controversial) management guru through these difficult times, and his Recession As Opportunity: Smart Moves for Tough Times (Euromanagement, Pounds 745) is a straight recording of his 1991 lecture on the subject. So why issue it a year later and - more to the point - why review it in 1993? Because business conditions have not changed and because what he had to say then is no less relevant now. This recession is unlike previous recessions, Peters thinks, in that, even after the economy picks up, intense global competition will be here to stay. His recipe for surviving, and even profiting, from this recession is therefore six-fold. First, redouble employee involvement and continuous improvement. Second, inculcate trust through the asymmetrical distribution of pain - that is, job losses, salary cuts or bonus cuts (as and where relevant) must be most severe at the top of the corporation and gradually less severe as one moves down towards ordinary workers. Third, improve and speed up stakeholder involvement. Fourth, keep up the attack on ensuring that you have world-class manufacturing. Fifth, the battleground for the 1990s is speed and the problem is that if you lose this battle you do not have a chance of ever catching up. Lastly, increase your professional development and advertising budget. You can see why Peters is controversial. Even if you disagree with him, however, you cannot deny that he makes you think - which is not something that can be said for all so-called gurus. I continue to carp, however, at straight videoing of lectures. Whether the perorations are given by gurus or by others, the medium militates against the form. If business videos are to be anything more than home-movies, they must accomplish something more than simply record. ***** A pack that tries to accomplish more is Market-led Strategic Change (NPC Associates, Pounds 750). Nigel Piercy can be equally fresh and uncomfortable in what he has to say about how to introduce and drive such change through an organisation; there is at least a presenter with whom there is some interaction, and there are various bits of drop-in footage. Why, then, is the video ineffective as video? Principally because Piercy allowed himself to work with a video-team who did not understand his message sufficiently, or perhaps did not have the clout to put it across effectively. The result is that Piercy's presentation style may be terrific in person, but is less effective on screen. That is not to detract from the importance of what he has to say and, fortunately, the rest of the pack more than makes up for this weakness: it includes his widely-praised book on the subject, the Trainer's Manual is good and the Worksheet Manual (consisting of Diagnostic, Implementation Planning, and Action planning worksheets) is excellent. ***** Incidentally, if you are looking for a guru on a particular subject, the first guide to European professors, Who's Who in European Executive Education has just been been released (IMEC Publishing). The same firm also produce the Official Guide to European MBA Programmes and have the still-unusual practice of issuing their material on computer disks. This makes the location of information wonderfully quick and easy. Up-to-date prices and other details of all these products are available from Prism International, which has a new phone number 0252-28215, as well as a new fax number: 0252-344117.</p>

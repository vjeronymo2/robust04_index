			<p>BFN     [Text] As before India is interested in military-technical  and trade-economic cooperation with Russia which "has  practically turned into an integral element of the Indian  economy's functioning," Russia's Foreign Economic Relations  Minister Oleg Davydov reported in his interview with Interfax.    In the course of the visit of Indian Prime Minister  Narasimha  Rao scheduled for Wednesday the parties are expected to sign  protocols on cooperation in the field of space research and  military-technical assistance. In addition, the parties intend  to undertake certain measures to increase the volume of trade  which dropped to $1 billion in 1993 compared with $1.3 billion  the previous year and $5.5 billion in 1990 - the most successful  year.    In his interview with Interfax a top-ranking official of the  Indian Embassy in Moscow expressed his opinion that lowering of  turnover in the Russian-Indian trade was caused "predominantly  by transport difficulties." In particular, after the collapse  of the USSR, Odessa (the most cargo from India was shipped via  this city) has become part of Ukraine. However, in the near  future goods from India will be delivered via the Novorossiysk  port.    The Foreign Economic Relations Ministry (FERM) experts point  out that India was one of the leading trade partners of the  former USSR, about 2 percent of the country's foreign trade was  with this country. Thanks to the procurements made in India the  USSR was able to import tea (about 70 percent), coffee (60  percent), black pepper (98 percent), jute and goods made of it  (more than 90 percent). In addition, the USSR procured a great  quantity of cotton cloth, medicines, detergents, and perfume.    The Soviet Union predominantly exported raw materials (more  than 65 percent) to India, including oil and oil products,  fertilizers, and non-ferrous metals. The USSR's share in  India's foreign trade was about 9 percent. More than 70 various  industrial facilities were built in India with the assistance of  the USSR.    In 1992-1993 the parties accomplished several measures aimed  at the development of new conditions for Russian-Indian  cooperation. In May 1992 they signed an agreement providing for  settling mutual accounts in hard currency (until that time the  trade was accomplished on clearing basis). The parties have  also introduced barter deals.    In the course of Russian President Boris Yeltsin's visit to  India in 1993 the parties reached several agreements on the  Indian debt. In particular, the debt to the former USSR totaling  about 320 million rupees (about $10 billion) is to be paid off  by payments in rupees which are to be spent for the procurement  of Indian goods. A 45-year postponement in paying off 120  billion rupees ($3.75 billion) with annual payments in equal  installments was granted to India (by 1994 Russia has already  received about $840 million towards India's debt).    More than 60 percent of the Indian military has been armed  thanks to the shipments of Soviet weapons over the last two  decades. In 1993 armaments and military equipment constituted  54 percent of Russian export to India. Nevertheless, according  to Russian experts, Russia has to take serious measures to  preserve and strengthen its positions on India's arms market in  as other arms exporters have become more active in that region  of late.</p>

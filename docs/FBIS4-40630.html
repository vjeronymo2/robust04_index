			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sergey Krayukhin: "Necessary to Do Without </F> Electricity During White Nights"]    [Text] St. Petersburg -- The "Lentransgaz" Production  Association has delivered a tough ultimatum to the "Lenenergo"  Joint-Stock Company -- it is threatening to stop supplying gas  to all St. Petersburg's power stations as of 21 June as a result  of outstanding debts.    The penalty [neustoyka] has reached the immense figure of 60  billion rubles. While cast in the role of debtor, the  "Lenenergo" Joint-Stock Company, for its part, cannot obtain the  money owed to it by its own big customers -- enterprises in the  former "defense sector." For the people of St. Petersburg the  result of this clash between the two giants could be that their  apartments will be lit at the end of June not by electricity,  but by the dim glow of the white nights.</p>

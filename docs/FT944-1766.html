			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Returning expats win tax ruling Expatriates and other non-residents coming to live in Britain will no longer be subject to tax on income from investments made offshore before they arrived in the UK, Barbara Ellis writes. The Court of Appeal ruled on Friday that section 739 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act, a wide-ranging anti-avoidance provision, is limited to people resident in the UK at the time of investing offshore. The Inland Revenue said it believed the potential loss of revenue would be Pounds 18m. The ruling came in a case in which the Revenue had pursued Professor Peter Willoughby for income tax on income accumulating on a Royal Life (Isle of Man) investment bond. Prof Willoughby, who taught law at the University of Hong Kong for some years before 1987, originally invested in the Isle of Man bond while resident in Hong Kong. But he was living in the UK when the original bond matured, and he reinvested in 1989 and 1990 in similar bonds. Prof Willoughby, now resident in Alderney, was supported in the court action by Royal Life. Mr Chris Lintott, solicitor for Prof Willoughby, said the decision overturned previous practice and interpretations of legislation which were virtually unchanged since 1936. The Revenue said it was considering a Lords appeal.</p>

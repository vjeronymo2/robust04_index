			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by "a responsible source at the Defense </F> Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Yemen" to the YEMENI NEWS  AGENCY, Aden]    [Text] Here is little Saddam, or the backward Saddam, as  described by the militant brother and great patriot, 'Ali Salim  al-Bid, chairman of the Presidential Council. Here is little  Saddam or the backward Saddam reappearing to try his luck in  Yemen, and there are similarities between today and yesterday,  when Arab and international states unanimously condemned Iraq's  invasion of Kuwait, and stood as one to force the Iraqi Forces  to withdraw from Kuwaiti territory. After the failure of Saddam  Husayn's scheme in Kuwait, he proceded to burn the oil  refineries and oilfields of fraternal Kuwait, dear to the heart  of every Arab. Today our people stood steadfast in the  Democratic Republic of Yemen with their brave Armed Forces, in  the face of the aggressive invasion of the ruling military  regime in Sanaa, and caused the failure of its attempts to seize  southern Yemen by force. There were unanimous Arab and  international demands for a cease-fire and the aggressor's  withdrawal.    At this very moment, 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih has resorted to an  attempt to destroy the Aden refineries, a vital and important  facility for the entire Yemeni people, both in the south and the  north. How ironic that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's four aircraft,  which carried out the aerial attack on the Aden refineries,  should destroy the fuel tank which supplies fuel to the northern  governorates. Our great air defenses were vigilant regarding  this aggression, and shot down three aircraft, while the fourth  one fled. We shall supply local, Arab, and international public  opinion with more details later. God is great, God is great.</p>

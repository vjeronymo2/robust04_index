			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / International Company News: DSM to hold payout despite fall DSM, the Dutch chemicals group, will pay an unchanged dividend despite a sharp decline in profits caused mainly by shrinking margins in its hydrocarbon and plastics businesses. Net profit after extraordinary items plummeted 40 per cent to Fl 516m (Dollars 275m) in 1991, while operating profit fell to Fl 630m from Fl 1.09bn the year before. The hydrocarbon and polymers division - which in 1990 accounted for Fl 520m, or nearly half, of total operating profit - saw its operating profit shrink to just Fl 68m, of slightly more than 10 per cent of the group total. Two other divisions, resins and energy, posted modest profit declines, while basic chemicals managed to increase operating results by 10 per cent to Fl 267m. Operating profit was also adversely affected by lower oil prices, which produced inventory losses of Fl 100m compared with gains of Fl 100m the year before. Despite the downturn, DSM is to maintain its dividend at Fl 8 per share, the level which has prevailed since the government floated its first tranche of DSM shares on the Amsterdam stock exchange in 1989. However, the company, which is still 32 per cent state-owned, will for the first time give shareholders the option of receiving part of the final Fl 5.35 dividend in shares rather than cash. Mr Ad Timmermans, the group finance director, said DSM's dividend policy was aimed at a stable payout. The high 1991 payout of 54.5 per cent of profits compares with 20.4 per cent in 1989, a record year for profits, and 32.7 per cent in 1990, producing an average dividend rate of 30.6 per cent since privatisation. The company declined to make a full-year forecast but said operating profit in the first quarter of 1992 is expected to equal the average of the lower third and fourth quarters of 1991, implying a year-on-year decline of 58 per cent. It added that DSM's new strategy of concentrating on core activities and decentralising its operations would lead to annual cost savings of Fl 100m to Fl 150m starting in 1993.</p>

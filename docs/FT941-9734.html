			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Food &amp; Drink: So, farewell Coonawarra claret - Jancis Robinson explains a new wine treaty which will have far-reaching effects Considering it produces well below 2 per cent of the world's wine, and is at least 20 hours' flying time from most of the world's vineyards, Australia wields an extraordinary amount of influence. Most obviously, there is a strong Australian element in the training of 'flying winemakers', the swelling band of itinerant oenologists who are shaping winemaking techniques in developing winelands all over the globe. Of more long-term importance, perhaps, are the achievements of Australian viticulturists in the world's vineyards, where they aim to flout the conventional wisdom that quality and quantity are incompatible. But signatures in Brussels and Canberra at the end of last month signalled an important new area of Australian influence, as well as a new era for Australian wine labelling. Five years of intense negotiation have resulted in a two-part, 200-page agreement by which Australia stops using Europe's cherished wine names - champagne, burgundy, chablis, port, claret etc - at home as well as abroad, in exchange for EU recognition of its winemaking techniques, its own analyses, and EU renunciation of the right to use Australian geographical wine names such as Coonawarra and Granite Belt. There was a bit of a hiccup when the Portuguese objected to Port Stephens as an Australian wine region but both negotiating teams are generally thrilled with the detail of this treaty. The turning point came when the Australians agreed to stop using the word champagne (it maybe significant that some champagne houses have investments in Australian wine). The Australians, on the other hand, clearly feel they have stolen a march on other New World wine producers in terms of ease of access of their wines. They have won concessions on the low natural acidity and high mineral content of some of their wines, on their naturally sweet wines which have until now fallen foul of EU law, and on their distinctly un-European habit of blending the produce of different regions. But they are particularly smug about their practices which are embodied in this, the EU's first bilateral wine trade agreement, representing an important step in the international harmonisation of winemaking techniques. It has already been used as a model for agreements with Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary and New Zealand and is likely to provide a framework for negotiations with such equally keen wine exporters as South Africa, Chile, and Argentina. The hardest country to bring into line will be the US, land of Gallo Hearty Burgundy. It may be the world's fifth largest wine producer, but it has nothing like Australia's commitment to exports, which now represent almost a quarter of production worth ADollars 21m (roughly Pounds 10m), expected to increase to ADollars 1bn by the turn of the century. Some current Oz favourites chosen specifically to appeal to European palates: Goundrey Langton Mount Barker Chardonnay. 1993. Pounds 4.99. Asda. Still one of the best bargains around, a relatively cool climate Chardonnay. The Riesling 1991 is equally lively, although delightfully mature, and costs Pounds 5.49 from Vin du Vin of Appledore, Kent (tel: 0233-83727), La Vigneronne of London SW7 (071-589-6113), and Andrew Darwin of Kington, Hereford (04544-230534).

Australian Wine Centre, London WC2 (071-925-0751). Delightfully understated and subtle. Not a trace of lime sherbet. Prelude Chardonnay. 1991. Pounds 6.99. Domaine Direct of London WC1 (071-837-1142) A steal. Leeuwin Estate's second label and a wine that hints broadly at the burgundian style of this top Western Australian Chardonnay at Pounds 12.50. Shaw &amp; Smith Sauvignon Blanc. 1993. Pounds 7.99. Oddbins, Adnams of Southwold, Suffolk (0502-724222) and Winecellars. One of the most convincing Sauvignons I have ever encountered.

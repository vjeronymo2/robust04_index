			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Dixons' short circuit If last year's disappointments at Dixons were suitably varied, this year's crop is depressingly predictable. Silo - the out-of-town US electrical retailer which has proved a dark and dangerous hole in the ground - has swallowed up yet more of the UK businesses' hard earned profits. When Dixons bought Silo in 1987 it claimed that it would not repeat mistakes of other UK retailers venturing into the US. Others had bought companies with weak competitive positions or poor managements, and to boot had run the operations from London. As it turned out, Silo had both a weak market position and poor management, and the lack of control from London until too late has proved a serious blunder. Dixons is having one last throw at revamping Silo, but the trial in three stores has the feel of a token effort. Indeed, the ground is being cleared for closure since the UK and overseas operations have been hived into separate subsidiaries. That will protect Dixons' ability to pay dividends when the Silo write-off strikes. The cash cost of closure will be lower than the monumental paper losses, although it will still cut shareholders' funds to an unacceptably low level  -all the more so since so much of Dixons' capital is in the form of preference shares. As European property development could still subside, a rights issue looks unavoidable if Dixons' directors wish to sleep at night. It is all such a pity since the main UK business is doing well despite pressure on margins from intensifying competition. Dixons must be left hoping that Circuit City does not decide to hand out the same treatment to electrical retailers in Britain.</p>

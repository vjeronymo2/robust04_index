He is determined  to continue them," Interfax was told Thursday by the chairman of  the Central Bank Viktor Geraschenko.    Regarding statements by former Finance Minister Boris  Fedorov, Geraschenko said that they seem to be like a "quarrel  in a communal kitchen." "I have never had to live in a communal  kitchen," he went on, "except for when I was evacuated from  Kazan, and I am accustomed to correlating my actions with those  of people who live and work beside me."    "Even different approaches to the reform must not reduce to  kitchen squabbles," said Geraschenko.    "My attitude to Boris Fedorov has always been normal and I  believe his rhetorical attacks against myself and Aleksandr  Zaveryukha are down to his age and character and I will not be  losing sleep over them."    "Fedorov is not that fine an expert in finances, and his  resignation will not be dramatic for Russia," believes  Geraschenko. "There have never been indispensable workers and  there will not be any in the future," he said.    He confirmed that fact that the reforms were reoriented to  meet social needs and flatly denied Fedorov's statements that  agriculture was a "black hole" through which the agroindustrial  complex was still seeking credits.    Geraschenko believes that it is unwise to rely on food  imports. Any country sustains its agricultural production, even  if it is less expensive to buy food abroad, he believes.    "It is necessary to import food and at the same time  increase  agricultural production in Russia," said the chairman of the  Central Bank of Russia.</p>

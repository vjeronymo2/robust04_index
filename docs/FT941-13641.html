			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Total of Lloyd's agents heavily cut The number of members' agents at Lloyd's of London has fallen by nearly a third over the past 12 months, signalling continued rationalisation among businesses trading on the insurance market. Only 46 members' agents - which handle the affairs of the individual Names whose assets have traditionally supported the market - will trade in 1994 compared with 65 in 1993 according to figures from Indemnity Insurance Services (IIS), an insurance broker and Lloyd's advisory company. Ten years ago more than 250 agencies handled the affairs of Names but the number has fallen sharply following losses of more than Pounds 6bn in the past five years. Lloyd's is pressing agents to transfer many of the their functions - such as holding Names' deposits - to a new central services unit run by the Lloyd's Corporation, which administers and regulates the market. The initiative is part of a move to improve the market's overall efficiency. Members' agents are also under intense legal pressures. Lossmaking Names have alleged that the advice provided by many in the 1980s was poor, and have targeted agents in more than a dozen separate legal actions. Already the financial resources of many agents have been stretched by the cost of contributing some Pounds 50m to a Pounds 900m proposal that Lloyd's has offered lossmakers in an attempt to settle disputes outside the courts. The agents named in the legal actions have net assets (aside from insurance cover) of no more than Pounds 80m according to the document that details the terms of the offer. Legal action became more likely last week when two large groups of lossmaking Names voted against accepting the deal, making it unlikely that Lloyd's will be able to secure its 70 per cent majority - by value of the offer - necessary for the deal to go ahead. A meeting of the Devonshire Names Action group last night overwhelmingly opposed an offer of Pounds 45m compensation, and said legal proceedings would start once the February 14 deadline for accepting the offer had passed. Meanwhile, IIS claims that the number of Lloyd's syndicates will decline in 1994, with 53 of the 228 syndicates active last year either merging or closing. Four new syndicates will start underwriting in 1994. In spite of the decline in numbers, both individual agents and syndicates will be bigger. Lloyd's ability to accept insurance premiums will rise from Pounds 8.7bn in 1993 to at least Pounds 10.5bn in 1994 following the attraction of new corporate capital to the market.</p>

			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Minority group may block banana plan THE EUROPEAN Commission was bracing itself for a potentially embarrassing upset last night, as signs emerged that a minority of European Community member states led by Germany might block the controversial agreement reached last December setting quotas and tariffs on banana imports from Latin America. Germany and Denmark held out against the agreement in December, when it was passed by qualified majority vote. Since then, however, new objections have been raised by the Benelux countries. If all five countries combined, they would have enough strength under the EC's weighted voting system to block the measure. The new regime, which is scheduled to be agreed by the end of this month and to start operating on July 1, fixes a 2m tonnes quota for Latin American so-called 'dollar bananas', at a reduced duty of Ecu100 (Pounds 82) a tonne, and imposes an Ecu850 tariff - about 170 per cent  - on imports above this level. Eight Latin American governments immediately expressed their 'absolute rejection' of December's agreement in principle, and said they would challenge it through the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The EC move is intended to unify the community's disparate banana regime in line with the principles of its single market; protect high-cost 'Euro-banana' producers from former colonies and outlying territories like Spain's Canary Islands and French Martinique; and bring its system of protection into line with the Gatt's Uruguay Round trade reform negotiations, which require tariffs on all farm produce, that subsequently can be reduced. The EC countries hostile to the plan consume the bigger and cheaper Latin American bananas, but had been expected to go along with the plan in the light of these three exigencies. 'We hope the political commitments entered into in December still stand,' said a senior official from the UK, which was then holding the presidency of the EC and so brokered last December's deal. As community farm ministers met yesterday, the odds were nevertheless perceived to be slightly against a blocking minority coalescing. Denmark, as current president of the EC, was expected to stay out of the dispute, since the presidency's primary goal is to conciliate. Mr Rene Steichen, the new farm commissioner, may have some influence in restraining his native Luxembourg, whose agriculture minister he was until January. Germany, moreover, senior commission officials argue, appears to have the impression that the 2m tonnes quota is semi-fixed, whereas the commission's intention is to adjust it on at least a monthly basis in line with demand. Germany, its allies, and the Latin Americans complain, however, that the quota is well below the 2.4m tonnes of dollar fruit the EC imported in 1991, equivalent to two thirds of total consumption. There is further controversy about plans to allocate a third of dollar fruit licences to traditional Eurobanana importers, enabling them thereby to cross-subsidise their own operations. However, Latin American imports surged by a third between 1988 and 1991, in what the commission describes as 'speculative imports' by exporters positioning themselves for the EC single market, which started up last month. Ministers were not expected to vote on the controversy until today.</p>

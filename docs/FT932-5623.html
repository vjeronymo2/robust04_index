			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / China moves to cut forex restrictions CHINA HAS taken an important step towards liberalising its economy by loosening some restrictions on its exchange rate. The move was not announced publicly, but an official of the State Administration of Exchange Control confirmed that restrictions had been eased on the rate at which China's currency, the yuan, trades in officially controlled swap centres where the bulk of foreign exchange transactions are conducted. The result was an effective devaluation of the yuan, which slipped in dealings at the Beijing swap centre to close yesterday at Yuan 10.2 to the dollar, compared with just over Yuan 8 on Monday. The new rate is close to the that available on the active street market, though the administered 'official' rate, used largely for trade transactions under the state plan, remains at Yuan 5.7 to the dollar. The swap market rate has slid by more than 50 per cent against the official rate in the past year. Western officials believe pressure from foreign business and institutions such as the International Monetary Fund pushed the authorities into measures aimed at restoring order to the currency markets. Business had argued that uncertainty over the value of the yuan, accompanied by fears of a continued depreciation, was undermining investor confidence. Joint ventures have complained of difficulties of access to foreign exchange in the swap centres. In spite of these concerns, foreign investment in China has continued to climb steeply. The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation said yesterday that 17,500 projects involving foreign capital had been approved in the first quarter of 1993, up 320 per cent on the same period in 1992. Nearly Dollars 25bn (Pounds 16bn) in foreign investment was committed, and actual investment in the first quarter reached Dollars 3bn, up 167 per cent on last year. Foreign economists saw the currency move as a step towards unifying China's exchange rates. A western official said: 'This is a pretty gutsy move. Let us hope this helps to stabilise the rate and allows the Chinese to move forward on unification.' But a European banker said the authorities faced the danger that fears of continuing depreciation, accompanied by demand created by a surge in imports, would fuel speculative pressure against the yuan. This week's move on currency reform may indicate that the authorities are planning to resort to 'administrative measures' to crack down on the black market. China's central bankers are also letting it be known they intend soon to phase out Foreign Exchange Certificates (FECs) issued to foreigners since the 1980s as a second tier currency. FECs have outlived their usefulness now that China's economy has been further opened. The US treasury in a report to Congress last month strongly urged China to reform its exchange system as a step towards redressing a ballooning trade imbalance. China's trade surplus with the US exceeded Dollars 18bn in 1992. The report also noted that China's re-entry to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade would depend on moves towards unification.</p>

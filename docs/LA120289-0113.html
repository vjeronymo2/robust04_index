			<p><P> December 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> FLORIDA;  </P> <P> SATELLITE HEADING TO ITS FIERY DOOM  </P> <P> NASA's tumbling Solar Max satellite plunged toward a fiery doom over the  Pacific west of Ecuador. NASA officials in Cape Canaveral, Fla., said any  debris that survived this morning's re-entry likely would fall harmlessly in  the Atlantic. The Solar Maximum Mission satellite was launched in 1980 to study  the sun. It was repaired by a shuttle mission in 1984, but its orbit has been  "decaying" -- growing lower -- dooming it to burning up in friction from  Earth's atmosphere.  </P></p>

			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Fresh move to aid worst-hit Names Lloyd's of London is making a fresh attempt to arrange for a charity to help some of the worst-hit members of the insurance market. Mr John Thompson, manager of Lloyd's hardship scheme, said yesterday that negotiations had begun with a national charity over arrangements for helping those who may face difficulties paying nursing home fees. Last year, Charity Commissioners refused to award charitable status to the Lloyd's hardship fund, which helps Names to avert bankruptcy.</p>

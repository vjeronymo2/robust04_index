			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / The Queen's Awards 1994: Invisible exports - Bechtel What is invisible, yet profitable, and exported only to return to the UK? And why on earth should anything which fits this description win a Queen's Award? The answer is people - or rather, their skills. Bechtel Ltd, the UK arm of the San Francisco based corporation, has won the Queen's Award for exports for the second time in three years by selling skills from the UK abroad - otherwise known as 'invisible exports'. 'Because we are a service company it is difficult to show what we export,' Bechtel says.

Between 1990 and 1992 Bechtel recorded substantial and sustained increases in export revenues from projects in the Middle East, Africa and the former Soviet states. For Africa alone, Bechtel's exports during that period increased by 600 per cent. Since 1988, overall export earnings have risen more than 300 per cent.

'We are looking to increase our market share particularly in those countries,' the company says. Bechtel's determination to expand the markets for services such as procurement and project management also has a knock-on effect for Britain's export industry, the company claims. 'We provide opportunities for UK manufacturers to bid for contracts worth many hundreds of millions of pounds,' Bechtel says. 'That is a significant contribution we can make by being successful.'</p>

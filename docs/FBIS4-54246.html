			<p>BFN     [Text] Noumea, May 27 (AFP) -- The second round of  Franco-Fijian military exercises ended Friday in Fiji and New  Caledonia, military sources said here. For the second year in a  row, 35 Fijian soldiers were integrated for 12 days in France's  Pacific marine infantry regiment, based in Noumea, and carried  out various maneuvers. At the same time, a group of French  soldiers from the regiment went to Fiji to take part in similar  exercises. Transportation was carried out by the French, as the  Fijians have no air force.    The French military commander here, General Rene Delhome,  said military cooperation with Fiji would be stepped up in the  future.</p>

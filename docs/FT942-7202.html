			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / International Company News: Bawag spotlight shifts offshore  -How the Austrian bank bolstered its earnings Austrian bankers have marvelled for years at how Bank fur Arbeit und Wirtschaft (Bawag), the country's third largest bank, has been able to achieve high growth and high profitability. The bank, controlled by Austria's trade unions, has nearly doubled its total assets in the past decade to Sch220.3bn (Dollars 19bn), and raised its market share in the savings deposit field from 2 per cent to just over 6 per cent. Over the same period, its operating profits have jumped more than six-fold to Sch1.45bn last year. In the past few weeks, as investigations into offshore investment structures operated secretly for several years by the bank's chief executive and his son have progressed, the explanation for this exceptional performance has become much clearer. The bank has confirmed that up to a third of its profits came from these offshore activities. The full scope and nature of these activities has still not been uncovered. But Mr Walter Flottl, the Bawag chief executive, has admitted that for more than six years he has directed some Sch22.9bn, a 10th of the bank's balance sheet, to offshore companies controlled by his son, Wolfgang, a high-rolling Wall Street trader. In a statement last week, Mr Walter Flottl spoke vaguely of 'direct loans, indirect loans and securities' arranged by Ross Capital Markets, a private Bermuda based company controlled by his son. Bawag has also confirmed that the investments included collateralised bond obligations, while Bankers Trust of New York, which last week withdrew a Dollars 100m credit line to the bank, said it was unhappy with Bawag's dealing with a Bermuda based hedge fund. Mr Flottl, a 70-year-old icon of Austrian banking, angrily rejected accusations that he exposed the bank to unacceptably high risks. 'If we had in fact been involved in such risky activities, we could not have had an unbroken six-year record of profits.' Loans were granted only against excellent collateral, he claims. He also defended the connection with his son. 'We had no branch in New York and for this reason, we used specialised firms which we could trust. Precisely because the son of the chief executive was the director of these firms we were able to build such a business relationship,' Mr Flottl said. The bank's supervisory board and the Austrian government's banking supervisors had been unaware of these operations for most of the past six years, while its auditors, KPMG Austria Wirtschaftsprufungs, appear to have been satisfied with imperfect explanations. He has not answered other, more pointed, questions. If the operations were safe and produced such high returns, why has he closed them down? And why has Bawag been less than forthcoming in dealing with questions from central bank investigators and journalists? (The FT submitted questions early this week in writing, as requested by Bawag, but has not yet received replies.) At a time when banking authorities and investors everywhere are increasingly worried about big banks' investment policies, observers wonder how the conventional control mechanisms could have been circumvented for so long. Austrian bankers have pointed out that the amounts involved were more than double Bawag's own capital. If something had gone wrong, the bank could have been wiped out. When the scale of the Flottl offshore operations became known in April, the Austrian National Bank sent in a four-man team to investigate. The FT has obtained a copy of the team's confidential interim report submitted on May 11. While it confirms that all the bank's capital has been repatriated, the investigators admitted that they were still far from having a complete understanding of what had gone on. 'No final verdict can be given at this point on the question of whether Bawag has any further financial obligations resulting from these credit transactions.' They chased down one loan file where the credit rose from Dollars 45m in 1992 to Dollars 58.8m last year, but on which no written contract existed. Austrian banking supervisors are embarrassed by the whole affair. They admit that it exposes not only failures of the bank's own risk management and internal audit functions but also lacunae in the regulatory apparatus. Only from this year will Austrian banks be required to publish full consolidated accounts. And, as in most countries, there is as yet no regulation of off-balance sheet activities. Mr Erwin Schmidbauer, director of financial markets in the Austrian National Bank, said the central bank first noticed that Bawag was up to something unusual last year by studying Bank for International Settlements (BIS) bank exposure statistics. Mr Schmidbauer also said suspicions would have been aroused much sooner if the Bank of England separated exposures to the Channel Islands from those of the UK as a whole. The Austrian authorities emphasise that Bawag remains a sound and liquid bank. However, investigations into transgressions of banking regulations and Bawag's own internal rules will probably cramp its style for some time. As for Mr Flottl, his contract expires next year, and no one expects it to be renewed.</p>

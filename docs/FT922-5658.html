			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / International Company News: Equitable Life shows improvement EQUITABLE Life Assurance, one of the largest US insurance companies, reported an after-tax loss of Dollars 13m during the first quarter of 1992, compared with a loss of Dollars 14.6m in the same period a year earlier, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The life insurer, currently converting from mutual to shareholder-owned status, added that improvements in its operating performance would depend on the company's ability to improve returns from certain classes of general account investment assets. Surrenders and withdrawals in the first quarter were Dollars 571.4m, down 15.7 per cent on the first three months of 1991. Surrenders in 1991 overall totalled Dollars 2.39bn, up 37 per cent on the previous year. Pre-tax profits from continuing operations during the first quarter totalled Dollars 25.3m, against Dollars 53.3m a year earlier. Equitable said that this reflected decreased results from the individual insurance and annuities segment.</p>

			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Canning falls to Pounds 4.5m after poor final quarter W CANNING, the Birmingham-based speciality chemicals and electronics distribution group, saw profits fall again last year to reach about half of the levels of 1989 and touch the bottom of the recessionary cycle. Pre-tax profits in the year to December 31 were Pounds 4.48m compared with Pounds 5.72m. This translated into earnings per share of 8.2p, down from 12.2p. Although this covered dividend payments - maintained at 7.29p after a final of 4.35p - the costs taken below the line of closing the Spanish electronics business meant that for the second year running Canning had to dip into reserves to give shareholders a return. Mr David Probert, chairman, said that the group had expected increased 1992 profits until a sharp downturn across the business in the final quarter. He described Canning's second half as 'one of the most difficult periods of trading in its long history.' This led to a Pounds 3m reduction in turnover to Pounds 114m. The effect of sterling's devaluation was marked on the balance sheet. Foreign borrowings, which had been matched against foreign assets, increased in sterling terms and gearing rose to 62 per cent, against 57 per cent at the end of 1991. However, gearing is set to decline by 19 percentage points when the group draws in Pounds 4.75m on April 2 from the sale of a French adhesives tapes company. The immediate outlook is more encouraging. There are signs of an upturn in the UK and chemicals demand from south-east Asia is increasing as exports obtain a competitive advantage from sterling's devaluation. But the important French and German markets are sluggish and the demand for electronic components is flat. Canning has been re-positioning its business. Investment this year will be on the chemicals side and there are not expected to be any chemicals disposals, possibly foreshadowing the group's departure from electronics distribution.</p>

			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Schroders Schroders has dropped so many hints of its intention to buy the rest of Wertheim that the actual deal scarcely comes as a surprise. The price it is paying looks reasonable, too, especially after last year's exceptional charge of Dollars 19m for the Ames department lawsuit is factored out of Wertheim's 1994 earnings. But there is a nagging question of what is to be gained by moving to full control when Schroders has already co-operated closely with Wertheim for eight years. Schroders would argue that the acquisition will make group strategic planning more coherent. There will be one organisation instead of two parallel ones. Full ownership of Wertheim will enhance its ability to distribute foreign issues in the US. It will create interesting prospects for corporate finance, for example advising US corporations on acquisitions in the far east. As a result Schroders may eventually succeed in moving Wertheim up several notches in the ranks of US investment banks. Sceptics might see these as nebulous advantages for a total price, including assumption of debt, of over Dollars 150m. The suspicion is that Schroders has simply found the first convenient home for its surplus capital. But in that case it has at least bought something familiar, and Schroders' strategic track record suggests a more substantial motive. As it expands, Wertheim will need extra capital which Schroders is now in a position to provide. If it can move Wertheim into the major league, Schroders will have made a productive investment.</p>

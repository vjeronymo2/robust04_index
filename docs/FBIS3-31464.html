			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Milan Dragovic] </F>   [Text] Zagreb, Feb 17 (AFP) -- NATO and UN officials  meeting here Thursday said they "agreed" on control of heavy  weapons around Sarajevo, in a bid to dispel reported differences  on how to implement NATO's threat to bomb Bosnian Serb weapons  still pointed at the Bosnian capital on Monday.    The meeting involved U.S. General George Joulwan, who is  both  NATO's supreme commander in Europe as well as commander of U.S.  forces in Europe, special UN envoy Yasushi Akashi of Japan,  French General Jean Cot, the commander of UN forces in former  Yugoslavia (UNPROFOR), and British General Charles Ritchie, the  force's chief of staff.    Questioned by journalists afterwards, Akashi said the  alleged  differences have "never existed, except in some media reports."    "I gave to General Joulwan what our conception and  definition  of control is," he said.    Joulwan backed this up, adding: "We are in agreement on the  definition of control."    Their meeting was called to define exactly what the North  Atlantic Treaty Organization and the United Nations consider  acceptable concessions by the Bosnian Serbs on their weapons  besieging the capital.    The meeting came three days ahead of a NATO ultimatum to  Bosnia's warring parties -- primarily the Serbs -- to withdraw  their weapons from around Sarajevo or place them under UN  control by midnight Sunday. Failing this, they will be bombed.    In Brussels Wednesday, NATO and UN officials also moved to  close ranks to dispel reports of differences over the definition  of "control" and to warn there was nothing ambiguous about the  ultimatum issued on February 9.    Joulwan is also to meet U.S. Admiral Jeremy Boorda, the  commander of allied forces for southern Europe (AFSOUTH), NATO  headquarters in Brussels said.    Boorda has been working closely with Cot for months,  traveling to Zagreb three times in the last week.    "All possible plans, mechanisms and scenarios have been  ready  for a while now" for any possible air strikes in Bosnia, a UN  military source told AFP.    The source said any mechanism to ensure no more shelling of  Sarajevo -- and thus avoid air strikes -- was "very complicated,  and even harder to implement since it must be accepted by all  the parties," in a 22-month-old conflict where all attempts at  resolving crises have broken down.    In Sarajevo, UNPROFOR spokesman Bill Aikman said there had  been a "significant number" of Bosnian Serb weapons regrouped in  UN-controlled zones, but said the Serbs appeared to be opting  more for "withdrawal from the area" outside the 20-kilometer  (12-mile) exclusion zone set by NATO.    By Tuesday, Bosnian Serbs had regrouped 36 pieces in two of  their barracks under the guard of unarmed UN military observers  and on Wednesday placed 20 additional heavy weapons under UN  control, but without moving them from their firing sites,  according to a senior UNPROFOR officer.    But he said these weapons had only been registered with the  UN, and not dismantled, in a procedure which observers said was  not exactly in line with UNPROFOR statements last Wednesday  specifying they must be put under armed UN guard.    UN spokesmen on the ground however expressed optimism,  including Peter MacFarlane in Sarajevo who said Thursday the  "process continues and at this stage those involved are  satisfied."    In Sarajevo, UNPROFOR commander for Bosnia General Sir  Michael Rose on Thursday also told the press "both parties  continue to cooperate in fulfilling the conditions of the  agreement."    He said the "essence" of UNPROFOR control over weapons was  "that if either party wishes to get their weapons back, force  will be used against them."    In The Hague, an official spokesman said the Dutch, U.S. and  British defense ministers would meet Sunday in Italy -- where  NATO warplanes are based -- at the request of U.S. Defense  Secretary William Perry to discuss Bosnia.</p>

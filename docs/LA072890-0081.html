			<p><P> July 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AUTOMATIC ROLLBACKS MAY NOT CUT SPENDING;  </P> <P> BUDGET: INDEPENDENT ANALYSTS BELIEVE IT WOULD BE EASY FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO  CIRCUMVENT THE TRIGGER MECHANISM.  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian's proposal for automatic cuts when the state is in  danger of running a deficit is likely to be approved by the Legislature but may  not achieve the governor's goal of curbing spending on social and welfare  programs, analysts and legislators said Friday.  </P> <P> Some Democratic lawmakers blasted the governor's plan as a power ploy designed  to decrease the Legislature's authority over the budget and cut spending on  Democratic-supported programs that help the poor, disabled, and aged.  </P> <P> "It sickens my stomach," said Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D-Santa Clara),  chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. "It's an abdication of the  Legislature's authority to protect poor people against a governor who has  little regard for people in need of government services."  </P> <P> On the other side, Republican lawmakers said the so-called trigger mechanism is  necessary to control a state budget that is growing faster than revenues  because of mandated increases such as the annual cost-of-living adjustments for  welfare recipients.  </P> <P> "The trigger mechanism is a step in the right direction," said Assemblyman Tom  McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks). The automatic cuts are needed, he said, because  "automatic increases programmed into the law combined with the lower Gann Limit  due to Proposition 111 . . . are driving state expenditures up much faster than  the ability of the public to pay for it."  </P> <P> But independent analysts said that during any future budget crunch it would be  easy for the Legislature to circumvent the automatic spending cuts through the  same type of "smoke and mirror" budgeting that Congress uses to evade the  Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act, on which the governor's proposal is modeled.  </P> <P> "The bottom line is that there is no such thing as an automatic trigger  mechanism. It's impossible," said Rod Kiewiet, a Caltech political science  professor who recently completed a study of the federal budget process. "The  generic problem is that a majority-rule institution cannot bind itself to a  future action. It can always be reversed by a majority in the future."  </P> <P> Kiewiet compared the situation to a person who goes on a diet by locking the  refrigerator and hiding the key. "But he knows where the key is. So has he  really locked the refrigerator? I don't think so."  </P> <P> The bipartisan leadership of both houses came out in support of the "trigger  mechanism" after meeting Friday with Deukmejian, who agreed to some crucial  changes in the proposal.  </P> <P> Originally, Deukmejian wanted the cuts to be triggered by a finding from the  director of finance -- a gubernatorial appointee -- that expenditures would  exceed revenues during the next fiscal year. The governor wanted the cuts to be  limited to health and social services, such as welfare and Medi-Cal.  </P> <P> After Democratic legislators balked at those proposals, the governor agreed  that the bipartisan Commission on State Finance would activate the trigger  mechanism and the cuts would be across the board.  </P> <P> Vasconcellos vowed not to support the trigger mechanism in any form, saying it  would mean "the end of California as we know it." But other Democratic leaders  said they would go along with the plan in order to end the state's  record-breaking budget stalemate.  </P> <P> "This gives the governor some face-saving crumb that may help the situation a  little," said Sen. Alfred E. Alquist (D-San Jose), chairman of the Budget and  Fiscal Review Committee.  </P> <P> The measure is necessary to avert "a constitutional crisis that would have  resulted if the governor or Assembly Republicans held firm" in their refusal to  compromise on tax increases, he said.  </P> <P> But Alquist didn't think the trigger mechanism would curb state spending. "You  can't depend on it," he said. "Congress is not finding the Gramm trigger to  have any importance -- it just stimulates more dialogue about the deficit."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Piet Lambrechts commentary: "Time Bomb"] </F>   [Text] Jean-Luc Dehaene, Willy Claes, and their colleagues  in the other EU [European Union] member states can polish off  their Easter eggs in peace and quiet. For the European Union  (EU) has once again been saved, thanks to a compromise which,  though the product of a Greek brain, deserves, more than  anything else, to be classified as Belgian. After all, a  compromise on the voting procedure following the EU enlargement  was finally reached with the awkward British and Spanish. The  fact that this settlement places European decisionmaking and  integration on unsteady footing is evidently a worry to the  members of our government.    Normally speaking, the blocking minority in the European  Council of Ministers, after the accession of four new member  states, should increase proportionately from 23 to 27 votes.  However, the United Kingdom and Spain managed to negotiate an  understanding that if member states together accounting for  between 23 and 26 votes oppose a decision, then that decision  will be subjected to a "reasonable" delay. In other words, the  British Government wants to be in a position to block any  further step toward European integration, while the Spanish  Government is seeking to protect its financial interests. The  British Government, in particular, succeeded in making British  obstinacy a "European problem." After all, the question as to  how Europe intended to resolve the British problem was asked  openly. In that context, it once again emerged that the British  attitude was connected not only with the intention of  maintaining its present position of power, but also with the  uncertain position of John Major as party leader and head of his  government.    Instead of putting the British under fire, telling them that  they should jolly well solve their own problems, and that they  certainly had no right to change the rules governing European  decisionmaking with the help of the Spanish, the other member  states were brought to their knees by the threat of British and  Spanish intransigence. The excuse made by those 10 member states  was that, if no concession had been made, then the accession of  the candidate member states on 1 January 1995 would have been  put at risk, as if the postponement of accession was a more  daunting prospect than weakening the EU itself by undermining  the decisionmaking process. The Ten maintain that the blocking  minority in fact was set at 27 votes, and that a minority of  between 23 and 26 votes can only delay any particular decision  for a "reasonable" period of time. To begin with, the concept  of "reasonable period of time" is extremely open to  interpretation. Furthermore, the possibility of such a delay  contains all the germs of fresh crises and stalemates. While  any member state and the European Commission can call for a vote  at any moment, will this really happen if a number of countries  steadfastly refuse to allow it?    The EU is reaping what it has sown. The irresponsible  refusal to address this issue before the talks on accession  began has meant that the so painfully secured rule of voting by  a qualified majority is now at risk once more. Even if no use  is ever made of the famous compromise in practice, it is still  irresponsible to lay such a time bomb underneath the Union's  decisionmaking process. And the fact that the compromise will  only apply until the upcoming Intergovernmental Conference  scheduled for 1996 is pure nonsense. What British or Spanish  Government will then relinquish the rights it has only just  acquired? There is one thing that the governments of the Twelve  can certainly not deny: Nothing has come of their solemn  promise to see the EU enlargement be accompanied by its  deepening. On the contrary.</p>

			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / UK Company News: Thonet range to sit alongside Parker Knoll Parker Knoll, famous for its reclining chairs, has announced that it is to distribute in the UK and the Irish Republic the modern chairs of Thonet of Austria, linking two of the world's most famous names in furniture. Michael Thonet, the inventor of the process by which wood for furniture is steamed and bent, brought his chairs to London for the Great Exhibition in 1851, finding international success and sales. Thonet, who had won the backing of Prince Metternich, the Austrian chancellor, had five sons who continued to spread the company's products around the globe. Between 1880 and 1930, when it employed more than 10,000 workers, the company made 50m chairs. Martin and Tom Jourdan, descendants of Frederick Parker, who founded Parker Knoll in 1870, walked into the Cologne furniture fair 14 months ago and offered to distribute Thonet's modern designs in the UK, alongside the Parker Knoll range, part of the furniture division of Cornwell Parker. The joint venture was announced in the Victoria and Albert Museum, where two of Michael Thonet's chairs are on permanent display.</p>

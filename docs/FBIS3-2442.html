			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter: "Li Peng Stresses Scheduled Restoration </F> of Sovereignty Over Hong Kong"]    [Text] Hong Kong -- In his government work report to the  National People's Congress [NPC] tomorrow, Premier Li Peng of  the mainland State Council will stress that, no matter what  setbacks occur, the government and people of the Chinese side  have the determination and ability to restore the exercise of  sovereignty over Hong Kong as scheduled and end British colonial  rule in Hong Kong.    On the Taiwan issue, Li Peng says: Any attempt or move to  separate the motherland will be in vain, "no matter what kind of  trick is used."    The sixth part of Li Peng's government work report, which is  on "actively promoting the motherland's reunification," very  briefly reviews the progress of bringing about reunification  with Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan, and deals with the Hong Kong  issue in quite a moderate tone.    The full text of the part on "reunification" in Li Peng's  speech is as follows:    In the new year, we will continue to unswervingly implement  the policy of "peaceful reunification and one country, two  systems" and will actively promote the great cause of reunifying  the motherland.    The dates for China to resume the exercise of sovereignty  over Hong Kong and Macao are approaching. As always, the  Chinese Government will abide by the Basic Law of the Hong Kong  Special Administrative Region, the Basic Law of the Macao  Special Administrative Region, and the relevant decisions of the  NPC Standing Committee in making all kinds of preparations for  ensuring Hong Kong's and Macao's smooth power transfers and  steady transitions. Now Chinese-Portuguese cooperation on the  Macao issue is proceeding smoothly. The talks between Chinese  and British representatives on Hong Kong's 1994-95 electoral  arrangements have ended and the responsibility is completely on  the British side. According to the decision of the NPC Standing  Committee, the Preliminary Work Committee of the Hong Kong  Special Administrative Region's Preparatory Committee has  started its work. No matter what setbacks occur, the Chinese  Government and people have the determination and ability to  restore the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong as scheduled  and ensure Hong Kong's long-term stability and prosperity.    As a result of the common efforts of the people on both  sides  of the strait, both sides' economic and trade cooperation  continued to develop last year. People-to-people contacts, as  well as exchanges in the cultural, scientific, technological,  and sports fields, further increased, and an initial  understanding was reached through consultations on routine  matters. We insist that the differences between the two sides  of the strait should be resolved by increasing contacts and  consultations under the principle of one China. "The  realization of the motherland's peaceful reunification is the  common wish of all Chinese people. Any attempt or move to  separate the motherland violates the fundamental interests of  the Chinese nation and will be in vain, no matter what kind of  trick is used. We hope the Taiwan authorities, and all the more  hope the Taiwan people, put national interests above everything  else and, together with us, make common efforts for the  development of both sides' relations and the advancement of the  motherland's peaceful reunification."    The possibility of Li Peng making revisions while delivering  the speech to the NPC session cannot be completely ruled out.</p>

			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / International Company News: Unexpected FM50m at Kemira Kemira, the state-owned Finnish chemicals group due to be privatised, yesterday reported an unexpected return to the black, announcing a profit after financial items in 1993 of FM50m (Dollars 9m) following a loss in 1992 of FM291m. Sales were up 6 per cent to FM11.8bn despite the favourable effect of a weak Finnish markka. But Mr Heimo Karinen, chief executive, said a series of internal cost-cutting measures, which saw the workforce reduced by 1,200 to 11,000, has begun to pay off, producing the return to profitability. An extraordinary charge related to rationalisation measures of FM20m left pre-tax profit at FM30m, compared with a pre-tax loss of FM338m in 1992. Mr Karinen said much of the cost of these measures had now been taken and he expected higher profits in 1994 despite little sign of significant growth in its main European markets. Kemira, which is 100 per cent state-owned, is one of the centre-right government's main candidates for privatisation. The government envisages a flotation of a one-third stake in the company. Although no timetable has been set, the company is understood to favour moving ahead this year.</p>

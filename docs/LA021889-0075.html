			<p><P> February 18, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HARRIFF FINDS RHYTHM TO LEAD TORREY PINES  </P> <P> Bounce, bounce, shoot.  </P> <P> That's all he was thinking.  </P> <P> Bounce, bounce, shoot.  </P> <P> Dan Harriff, guard for top-ranked Torrey Pines, was told by a coach before  Friday night's game with visiting Poway to concentrate on nothing but two  bounces and the shot when he went to the free-throw line. So with 32 seconds  remaining, and Poway's last hopes of victory riding on the possibility Harriff  might fold under pressure, Harriff blocked out everything except bounce,  bounce, shoot. The free throws that followed were pretty enough to be  accompanied by Mozart.  </P> <P> Instead, they were accompanied by a 60-53 Torrey Pines' victory, an undefeated  Palomar League season and media attention Harriff sees about as often as the  Falcons (27-1, 12-0) lose.  </P> <P> Harriff made two more free throws seconds later to extinguish Poway's upset  bid. The Titans (19-4, 8-4) worked hard, making a nice run in the fourth  quarter and pulling within four with 2:32 remaining on a layup by Adam Jones.  </P> <P> But after stealing two errant Torrey Pines' passes, Poway was unable to score.  Then Harriff made two. Then two more. That was that.  </P> <P> "Excuse me, media star," said Courtie Miller as he walked out of the locker  room, past Harriff and a host of reporters.  </P> <P> Miller, usually the Falcons' star, was solid if unspectacular Friday, scoring  14 points to lead Torrey Pines. Just typical.  </P> <P> Harriff, in his own way, played a fairly typical game, too. He stole several  passes, got dirty on the floor a couple of times diving for the ball and scored  11 points, most of them timely, to boost his team heading toward the playoffs.  </P> <P> "That's my role," he said. "If we win games, then I'm happy."  </P> <P> Torrey Pines didn't cruise through this one as easily as it has most games.  Poway, well prepared as usual by Coach Neville Saner, pestered the Falcons  throughout the first half with quick layups by Greg Sorrell and solid outside  shooting by Gabby Awbrey and Jay Blankenbeckler, who finished with a game-high  20 points.  </P> <P> Holding a 33-27 lead at halftime, the Falcons looked as if they would pull away  quickly at the beginning of the third quarter, taking a 10-point lead.  </P> <P> But the Poway players wiped their brows in the fourth quarter and kept gnawing  at the Falcons' defense. A free throw by Jones pulled the Titans within two  early in the fourth quarter. Kyle Armstrong, one of two Torrey Pines  three-point specialists, hit one with 3:57 left to give his team a comfortable  eight-point lead. Poway managed one more run before Harriff decided things.  </P></p>

			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Overseas fall behind 27% dip at Renishaw RENISHAW, the maker of precision measuring probes and inspection equipment, reported a 27 per cent fall in interim profits as its main industrial markets suffered, particularly Japan, France and Germany. Sales of co-ordinate measuring machines and laser calibration products increased but demand for measuring probes fell in line with recession in the machine tool sector. Pre-tax profits in the six months to December fell from Pounds 4.18m to Pounds 3.07m on sales up 3.3 per cent at Pounds 22m. Earnings per share fell from 6.1p to 4.4p but the interim dividend is maintained at 2.5p. Mr David McMurtry, chairman and chief executive, said the group had increased marketing in emerging Far East markets while a new subsidiary had been set up in Hong Kong. The North American market was showing signs of recovery and there were indications that other markets had also reached a floor. 'This leads us to believe that the demand for our products, might now begin to recover,' Mr McMurtry said.</p>

			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Arts: Sexual taboos versus the human spirit - Television We see Betty Jones, who is 71, come up the stairs and into the bedroom, saying: 'I was a domestic here 50 years ago - no, more than 50 years ago. I had this terrible pain, I can remember. I came up here and I thought 'I'll just get up on the bed'. I sat on the bed and I had this terrific pain, and out pops this baby, and I thought 'Where's that come from?' It was fixed to me by the cord and I thought 'I haven't got to go through life with that fixed to me, surely?' I didn't even know I was pregnant. I was petrified. The mistress comes in and she says 'You wicked girl, Betty, look at the mess you've made. You've got to pay for those sheets, you're not getting any wages'. Next thing I knew the ambulance men came and took me off to a mother and baby's home'. The astonishing thing about this is that Betty Jones is not an actress delivering lines from an 18th century diary but a woman speaking to us from her own memory. We see her in Episode 3 of the BBC2 series A Secret World Of Sex which began last night and will continue for another five weeks. Once in a while a series turns up, usually documentary, which really does what the cliche says: opens a window on the world to reveal something which we may have heard about, but had never seen clearly before. Betty Jones's recollection typifies the way in which A Secret World Of Sex achieves this. With a vividness and immediacy which is often enthralling, and all too frequently painful, it uses personal witness to lay before us the ignorance, guilt, fear and cruelty which surrounded virtually every aspect of sex for those who grew up in the first quarter of the 20th century. Again and again women who had never been told how pregnancy occurred ('I thought what he was doing was just the 'in' thing') explain how they attempted suicide rather than face the stigma of an illegitimate child. A woman who was raped when she was 14 tells matter of factly how she could not possibly explain this to her mother. She had a breakdown and ended up in mental hospital. The series was commissioned by BBC Bristol from the independent company Domino Films, but the moving spirit behind it is Steve Humphries. Eight years ago, as a lecturer in social history at Essex University, he began the research work for a book. He says: 'I was curious to find out how the old, narrow attitudes towards sex affected the lives of people brought up before the last world war. The taboo on sex amongst that generation is still so great that we know very little about their sexual experience. I decided that the only way to find out what happened was to ask them before it was too late.' So he did, and the interviews form a major part of his book, also called A Secret World Of Sex, which appeared in 1988 (Sidgwick &amp; Jackson, Pounds 11.99). It contains many of the stories, photographs, and statistics which, as director/producer, he has now included in the BBC series. But what the book does not and cannot include is the tone of voice, the glint in the eye, the defiance of those who agreed to tell their stories for his cameras. No doubt the very fact that they did agree proves that they are atypical: more self confident than most, a bit bolshie perhaps, in many cases remarkably brave, even by the standards of this new age of supposed permissiveness. It must take considerable courage for a white haired lady in her seventies to describe in front of a film crew how her parents came home unexpectedly when she was with her boyfriend and 'I had to push my knickers in my handbag'. There is of course humour. Last night's opening programme included an account from Evelyn Nelson (81) of necking in a field of long grass when the farmer called a policeman who blew his whistle and demanded they come out: 'It was like a football match, so many people got up'. However, some of these first person accounts are so appalling that it is difficult to go on watching. Yesterday's programme included the story of Edna Higginbottom, born in 1923, who was discovered by her grandfather to be having a sexual relationship when she was 15. He called the police who asked 'Did intercourse take place?' and upon being told 'Yes' hauled her into court where her grandfather said 'Shut her away' and signed the necessary papers. She was promptly locked up in a mental home and kept there for 20 years. Nor was this particularly unusual, it seems: under the 1913 Mental Defectives Act, girls who brought shame on the family by consorting with men were routinely locked away. There is nothing revolutionary or, these days, even very unusual about the way these programmes are made. My own shorthand for the technique is 'World At War' because they employ the mixture of archive film, still photographs, and new interviews of those with good memories which was used so powerfully in the memorable Thames series about World War II. A Secret World Of Sex gains greatly from a model delivery of the commentary - in other words unselfishly unnoticeable - by Zoe Wanamaker (who recently gave such an outstanding performance as the murderer's moll in Prime Suspect) with none of the distracting histrionics which Laurence Olivier loaded onto The World At War. Each of the six episodes deals with a particular taboo: sex before marriage, pornography and prostitution, illegitimate babies, homosexuality, sexual violence, and VD. They are packed with memorable vignettes: the description of men at Soho's old Windmill theatre with cameras hidden in chocolate boxes; Lady Marguerite Tangye's account of debs' delights being aroused by debs in the backs of cars and then resorting to the lower class gels at the Bag O'Nails club for relief. Some programmes are better than others, the most powerful of the lot being the third, 'In Disgrace', which tells of five women, including Betty Jones, who bore illegitimate babies: 'I felt like killing myself, but didn't know how to start' . . . 'I was treated like an outcast' . . . 'My mother saw my morning sickness and said 'Are you pregnant?' and I said 'What's pregnant?'' The wickedness of keeping young women in ignorance, and then persecuting them for the natural results of that ignorance is enough to make you scream with anger. However sad today's one-parent family phenomenon, it is surely better than this hideous injustice. But the most impressive aspect of the series is its collective strength. Together these programmes manage to convey not just a graphic impression of the sexual aspects of pre-war society, but a powerful sensation of how it must have felt to live with all that guilty conscience, and terror, and victimisation. As you listen to the self-righteous sermonising of the religious and the 'purity league' members, it serves as a forceful reminder of how many would still like to drag us back into that cesspit of ignorance today. In the name of 'innocence' the moralists want to sterilise television and push young people back into the dark. Yet it seems unlikely they will manage it.  The most heartening aspect of this series is the character of the people who agreed to talk to Steve Humphries. Of necessity they are in their seventies, eighties or nineties, yet few of them look or sound anything like that old. Perhaps an enthusiasm for sex keeps you young. Moreover, even allowing for the fact that they are by definition the bolder members of their generation, it is their obduracy which is so striking. As Eastern Europeans later in the century would survive the political totalitarianism of their societies, these Britons outlasted the moral totalitarianism of theirs, showing that the human spirit can withstand just about anything.</p>

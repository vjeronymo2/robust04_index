"I don't believe the Fed has decided to tighten the credit  condition. Rather, it has driven it to natural [as received],"  the source said on condition of anonymity.    Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan said Friday the Federal Open  Market Committee has decided to tighten its credit policy which  is "expected to be associated with a small increase in  short-term money market rates."    The source said the Fed has so far guided interest rates  lower as an emergency step to realize the economic recovery and  the stable financial mechanism.    "Now that the U.S. economy is on the recovery, the Fed may  have given up the idea of lowering rates. If it continues to  ease credit conditions, fears of inflation may arise," the  source said.    "Interest rate development in the Japanese short-term money  market is set by domestic factors, rather than the U.S.'s. It  is hard to believe it will have a big influence on Japan's  credit policy."</p>

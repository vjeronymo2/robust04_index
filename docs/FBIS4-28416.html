			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["What Is Rumor of `Threat From North Korea' Aimed At" -- </F> KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, June 9 (KCNA) -- Japanese RENGO news  agency recently reported "What is the Rumor of `Threat From  North Korea' Aimed At," an article by Shigeo Hayashi, a  researcher of peace and military affairs.    The article says:    Strange, indeed, are the reports of mass media about the  "nuclear suspicion" against North Korea. It is clear that they  are intentionally fabricating information and misleading public  opinion for a dramatic switchover in the military policy of  Japan.    They are spreading the rumor of "threat from North Korea"  not  only to promote the new U.S. strategy but to bring a turnabout  in Japan' military policy and make people understand it.    While hastening military collusion with the United States,  Japan seeks to establish a political and military system  facilitating the use of armed force overseas.    This is why Japan is getting overheated in crying over  "threat from North Korea" as she cried for "international  contribution" at the time of the Gulf war.</p>

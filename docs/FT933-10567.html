			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Money Markets: No instant rate cuts EUROPEAN money markets were kept guessing yesterday as the major ERM central banks chose not to exercise their new freedom to cut interest rates, writes Stephanie Flanders. By the end of the first day's trading, only Portugal had rushed to ease monetary conditions, lowering its emergency lending rate to 13.0 per cent from 14.5 per cent. The Bank of France signalled early on that there would be no immediate official rate reduction, leaving the key intervention rate at 6.75 per cent. At least some in the market must have been disappointed by the French central bank's show of restraint, because afternoon trading brought French franc futures down a little from their morning highs. The September Pibor contract closed in Paris at 94.09, still 37 basis points higher than Friday's close, but lower than the 94.48 seen early yesterday. Analysts said one should expect lower official rates in France in the near future, but possibly not as early as this week. 'You would not have expected rate cuts today,' said a London economist. 'But what is the point of such a wide band if you are not going to lower rates quite substantially?' Several observers now expect French discount rate to fall below 5 per cent over the next two or three months. French call money finished Monday down from the levels seen during the previous week's turbulence, at around 9 7/8 per cent on the bid side. The Danish and Belgian central banks also chose not to cut interest rates. Denmark's central bank offered a special four-week liquidity pact at a fixed 25 per cent yield, and announced that the 14-day repo rate would remain fixed at last week's level of 11 per cent. But one source said the high Danish rate was unlikely to stay in place very long: 'I expect the repo rate to fall, if not at Thursday's tender, then almost certainly by the end of next week.' Sterling markets had a slightly less bearish flavour than during the latter part of last week. But on balance, traders still seemed to believe that the ERM revamp would mean speedier reductions in UK official rates. The September sterling contract lost 7 basis points to close at 94.38, but the implied expectation of 5.62 per cent three-month money by the autumn remains significantly lower than a week ago.</p>

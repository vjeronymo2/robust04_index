			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Arts: The West End is alive with the sound of music - Malcolm Rutherford concludes that advance publicity built on previous reputation seems to be the key to success IN THE London theatre, this was the week of the musical and it looks like being the summer of the musical as well. If you look through the list of West End theatres, musicals of one kind or another now occupy, or about to occupy, more than half. In terms of seating capacity the figure is higher because musicals go for the larger places. The arrivals this week were Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber's Sunset Boulevard at the Adelphi and a revival of Grease at the Dominion; the sad news was the imminent closure of City of Angels at the Prince of Wales. I have been trying, without much headway, to work out what makes a musical a success in box-office terms. One explanation is clearly advance publicity, built on previous reputation. The publicity for Sunset Boulevard was enormous. Even after the first night more space was devoted to the celebrities attending and the party that followed than to the piece itself. The reviews (including mine) were muted because although there is much to enjoy, notably Ms Patti LuPone's performance as Norma Desmond, the show is uneven and not a patch on Lloyd Webber's best work, such as Evita. But the reviews did not matter since the publicity had ensured that sufficient seats were sold in advance to make for a long run. That was the mistake of City of Angels. It had no London track record to draw on and the advance bookings were small. It was assumed that it would sell on merit and word of mouth, but it didn't. With hindsight, Angels may have had another fatal flaw. It is a newish kind of muscial in that it combines wit and a good script with the songs. Although it harks back to the past and the private detective world of Philip Marlowe, it is a past more familiar to Americans than to the British. No such criticism can apply to Sunset Boulevard which, while it comes from a similar Hollywood background, is straightforward, romantic, sentimental stuff. Nor could it possibly apply to Grease, which is about as straight and uncomplicated as you can get, despite a possible teenage pregnancy. Grease was nostalgic when it was written - in the late 1960s about the late 1950s. It is even more of a throwback now that it has returned to the stage retaining some of the songs that it picked up in the intervening movie. One admires the zest and professionalism of the playing, but it is a remarkably conservative piece where the adolescents have no interests beyond dating and rock and roll. It does not remotely stand up to Buddy, which has been running for years at the Victoria Palace and has the virtue of a strong story. Nevertheless, Grease is a great success. It is not only the the teenagers in the audience who jump up and down to the music; it is the people who were teenagers when the piece was written. As Jim Jacobs, the co-author, writes in the programme, Grease is 'a celebration, a party of the best kind'. A good-ish party is what it remains, but it is a celebration of the past, and perhaps that it part of the current recipe for a successful musical. Even Sunset Boulevard depends heavily on a movie made more than 40 years ago. The mixture is one of familiarity and one art from drawing incestuously from another. As a footnote, I went on Thursday to the final of the Vivian Ellis Prize at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. This is a national competition to encourage young writers for the musical stage. There is no shortage of entrants. Practically every one of the finalists, however, was looking backwards. Far and away the best contribution (I thought) was from a piece called Otto by Alaric Barrie and Chalky Horsfall. It is about an American football team and based on Othello. Yet the official prize went to Boorskale, written by Paul Tomkinson around three elderly, disabled sisters living in a bungalow in Derbyshire. Possibly there really is a search for something new in unlikely places.</p>

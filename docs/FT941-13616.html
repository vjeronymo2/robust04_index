			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Business and the Law: When waste is not wanted - Germany's recycling legislation Germany has no difficulty in persuading companies to recycle packaging - they have to do so, by law. The scale of German recycling, however, has caused problems for other countries in Europe. By generating large surpluses of recyclable materials, which the German market cannot absorb, it is cheaper for recyclers to obtain waste paper and plastics from Germany than to collect them locally. The surpluses have also caused domestic problems for Germany: the private-sector organisation that collects the materials has run into financial trouble as the costs of recycling escalate. The regulation that helped to create this situation was the 1991 Packaging Ordinance; the government proposes to amend this around March. The latest draft provides for a relaxation in recycling targets and allows a limited amount of the surpluses to be incinerated to recover their energy content. However, most of the essentials of the ordinance would remain unchanged. The ordinance compels German producers of packaging waste to take it back for reuse or material recycling. Incineration for energy recovery is currently not allowed. Manufacturers, fillers, wholesalers and retailers must take back packaging from the link below them in the chain, beginning with the retailer, who must take it back from the consumer. For transit packaging, the new text softens the demand for material recycling - it will only be required where 'technically possible' and 'the additional costs . . . are not unreasonable in comparison with other recycling processes'. This is apparently left to the holder's judgment. This relaxation should help waste managers who take on the collection and recycling duties of their customers and seek an outlet through energy incineration. However, the revised ordinance needs to make the cost comparison clearer. In theory the take-back rule also applies to sales packaging. In practice, retailers avoid turning their shops into rubbish dumps by belonging to a government-approved independent collection and separation system, which meets set collection and recycling targets. This system is run by Duales System Deutschland, which charges packaged goods producers and importers a fee for the right to display a 'green spot' on their packaging - a symbol that tells the retailer it will not have to take back that packaging from customers. Householders separate their packaging waste, to be collected and passed to reprocessors without charge. DSD's fee operates as a subsidy, financing collection and separation of unlimited quantities of packaging waste. This charge becomes the waste manager's sole source of profit. The new text for the ordinance alters the current Dual System's targets. At the moment, targets cover, first, quantities collected, and second, amounts sorted, of suitable quality material. The new text abandons collection targets under such a Dual System, and fixes minimum recycling rates as a percentage of total packaging marketed. The percentages (by weight, see table) are lower under the proposed amendment, and instead of being brought in through two stages, there are three. In the ordinance the sorting targets are expressed as a percentage of packaging collected, so the more that is collected, the more has to be sorted. The minimum recycling rate is effectively the collection percentage multiplied by the sorting percentage. With the exception of glass, all targets for the first stage are higher. However, they fall from January 1 1996, the most significant reduction being for the following three-year period to January 1 1998. For plastics, half the minimum target must be met by techniques ensuring new use through melting, dissolving or turning into pellets. The new text will permit energy incineration once collection targets are achieved. Failing this, excess materials must be sent to the public authority for incineration as commercial waste. In 1992, the Federal Cartel Office ruled against any extension of DSD's activities to industrial waste. The Dual System therefore applies only to collections from households, cafes, bars and small businesses. A companion measure, the Marking Ordinance, would apply from July 1 1995, after clearance by the European Commission. This would require all packaging to be marked with the word Mehrweg (multi-trip, or reused several times) or Einweg (one-trip). Packaging manufacturers must indicate Stofflich Verwertbar (recyclable), Verwertbar (if recoverable in another way) or Nicht Verwertbar (non-recoverable). Polymers must be listed separately. For one-trip packaging, an indication must be given on the pack of the estimated disposal cost. This, however, could mislead the consumer, who does not have full information about the packaging's cost-effectiveness. Another country with recycling legislation is France. In 1992 it passed a decree for household packaging waste under which, as in Germany, the producer must either take it back or pass responsibility to a state-approved organisation and pay for an identifying logo. However, the French manage to avoid some of the pitfalls of German legislation, even in its amended form. Thus France makes membership of a government-approved collection scheme a legal requirement for fillers and importers, rather than relying, as Germany does, on retailers to police the system. To keep supply and demand roughly in balance, France gives clean energy incineration equal status with recycling. Also commitments from sectoral recycling organisations predetermine collection and separation volumes of the local authorities. French local authorities are responsible for collection, and 'green spot' licence fees are used to help them develop their systems. Germany still follows the expensive, inefficient line of insisting on independent recycling. France is preparing a separate law for industrial and commercial waste which makes maximum use of existing collection systems, an example that Germany should follow. And in contrast to Germany's rigid targets, France does not prescribe targets by legislation but imposes them through the machinery for licensing the organising agency. This allows flexibility. Germany's recycling targets are much higher than the maximum figures in the draft European Union Packaging Directive. The directive allows member states to set higher targets if the Commission confirms that they avoid internal market distortions and do not hinder compliance by other member states. Germany opposes this condition and, if challenged, will invoke article 100(a)(4) of the Treaty of Rome, which permits national environmental protection measures after a harmonisation measure is passed. Arguably, the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg should rule that that this refers to the EU environment as a whole rather than Germany's national environment.

			<p><P> April 8, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Comex Chief to Resign: The president and chief executive of the Commodity  Exchange of New York, Alan J. Brody, announced his resignation, effective June  30. Brody, 36, said he plans to pursue other business opportunities. Brody has  served as Comex president and chief executive since 1981 and as chairman from  1987 to 1988, guiding the exchange through the silver crisis of the early 1980s  and complex internal structural changes and fiscal issues. He also was the  youngest person ever to be appointed to the presidency of a U.S. futures  exchange. A committee has been appointed to seek a replacement, officials said.  The Comex is the world's most active metals futures market. "He has seen us  through some some turbulent periods, record volume years and a major overhaul  of our trade processing," Comex Chairman John H. Hanemann said. "It will be  very difficult to replace him."  </P></p>

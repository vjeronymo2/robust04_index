			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Crisis in Greece as PM sacks cabinet THE Greek prime minister, Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, sacked his entire cabinet yesterday, promising a new one within 24 hours, Reuter reports from Athens. He said he wanted a free hand to reshape the conservative government after months of internal feuding over his handling of the economy and foreign policy. According to his spokesman, Mr Mitsotakis, 74, 'asked for the resignations of the cabinet members. He will go ahead with a reshuffle. Tomorrow at noon he will swear in the new ministers'. The prime minister, with a one-seat majority in the 300-seat parliament, tried to whip dissenting deputies from his New Democracy party into line during a stormy meeting on Tuesday. But he faced renewed accusations after the session of being out of touch with ordinary people in pushing through a harsh austerity and economic reform programme aimed at trimming Greece's Dollars 75bn national debt. Political commentators said all cabinet seats were open and there was no early betting on new names to take up the key ministries of defence, national economy and foreign affairs. If Mr Mitsotakis replaced Mr Mihalis Papaconstantinou as foreign minister and Mr Stephanos Manos at economy, it would mark a sea-change in government direction. Mr Manos, a no-nonsense technocrat, has made no concessions to powerful special interest groups while driving through the austerity programme. Last month he earned the government its first praise from the European Community for its economic policies, especially his unpopular decision to force through privatisation and to raise taxes to meet 1992 budget revenue targets. Mr Papaconstantinou, a veteran politician, has been overseeing a campaign to block international, especially EC, recognition of the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia. One of the Balkans' most obscure but potentially explosive disputes, the recognition issue has stirred deep nationalist feelings in Greece. Failure to hold the line at the Edinburgh summit next week could lead to the fall of Mitsotakis. The former Yugoslav republic is accused of having territorial ambitions against Greece's Macedonia province.</p>

			<p><P> August 5, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> GREEN VALLEY FIRE CONTAINED AFTER CHARRING 500 ACRES  </P> <P> A brush fire that scorched more than 500 acres and briefly threatened 460  houses in the remote community of Green Valley was contained Friday night, and  a few separate, smaller fires of suspicious origin were quickly extinguished  nearby, the Los Angeles County Fire Department reported.  </P> <P> The largest fire started about 11:30 a.m. near San Francisquito Canyon Road and  Spunky Canyon Road, within half a mile of the origin of a fire that burned  2,250 acres and destroyed one home and two barns in June, authorities said.  Like the earlier fire, Friday's blaze was apparently caused by man.  Investigators found a book of matches at the spot where the fire started, said  Bruce Bundick, U.S. Forest Service spokesman. But the exact cause of the fire  remained under investigation, Bundick said.  </P> <P> A firefighter was taken by helicopter to Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital  in Valencia after he broke a leg battling the blaze on a steep hillside, Fire  Capt. James Jeffries said. There were no other reported injuries.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 150 Yards From Houses  </P> <P> No residents were evacuated, although some packed their valuables and left,  authorities said. The fire came within 150 yards of several houses.  </P> <P> Ed Sargent, who owns a house on Calle Maleza just north of the fire's edge,  praised firefighters for keeping the flames at a distance.  </P> <P> "I saw the fire coming over the hill from the west," he said, as the blackened  hillside behind him continued to smolder. "I strung out the garden hose, but  you don't really need it when you've got so many firefighters to help you."  </P> <P> The blaze was one of at least five fires -- all of suspicious origin --  reported in the Santa Clarita Valley area within a four-hour period Friday,  Jeffries said. All started near roadsides, he said.  </P> <P> "It sounds like somebody was just driving around and lighting them all,"  Jeffries said. "That's about how long it would take them to get from one to  another." No suspects were in custody Friday evening, he said.  </P> <P> One of the smaller brush fires, which started about 1:20 p.m. near the Antelope  Valley Freeway and Escondido Canyon Road south of Agua Dulce, burned less than  two acres and was contained in one hour, Jeffries said. Half an hour later,  another fire was quickly extinguished after it burned an acre at Avenue S and  the Antelope Valley Freeway south of Palmdale, Jeffries said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Burned 13 Acres  </P> <P> Two additional brush fires -- one at Sierra Highway and San Fernando Road and  the other on the grounds of a defunct alcoholism rehabilitation center in Santa  Clarita -- started shortly after 3 p.m. and burned 13 acres, Jeffries said.  </P> <P> Fire Capt. Scott E. Franklin said 450 firefighters battling the Green Valley  fire were aided by favorable wind conditions that pushed the fire southeast  along the shaded north side of a mountain range and kept it from moving north  toward houses.  </P> <P> Franklin said firefighters were especially lucky because drought conditions and  the dying of old brush have created an extreme fire hazard in Southern  California this summer. Brush moisture content in the area, normally between  75% and 80% at this time of year, is only 60% -- the level normal for October,  he said.  </P> <P> "We got by the bullet this afternoon," Franklin said. "We were very concerned  we were going to get spot fires across the fire break because the fire column  shot so high."  </P> <P> Times staff writer Steve Padilla contributed to this article.  </P></p>

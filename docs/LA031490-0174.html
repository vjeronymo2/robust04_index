			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SIDELINES;  </P> <P> STRAWBERRY MUST PAY SUPPORT  </P> <P> A judge today ordered New York Mets outfielder Darryl Strawberry to pay $40,000  in past-due child support payments and an additional $2,000 a month to a woman  who says the baseball star fathered her son.  </P> <P> Judge Philip Sweeney of the St. Louis County Circuit Court said Strawberry, who  did not contest a blood test indicating that he is the child's father, earns  $110,000 a month and is seeking a multimillion-dollar contract.  </P> <P> The child was born in June, 1988, to Lisa Clayton, who had sought more than  $11,000 a month in support payments.  </P> <P> Under Sweeney's order, both the $40,000 representing past support and the  $2,000 a month in future payments will be divided between the mother and a  court-appointed representative of the child.  </P></p>

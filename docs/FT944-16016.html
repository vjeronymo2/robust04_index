			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Right ingredients for education and business Sir, Your article on the links between education and companies, 'Business lessons on the timetable' (October lO), makes some excellent points. Our BSc sandwich degree in graphic media studies has had to confront many of the issues you raise during its 30-year history of preparing students for careers in printing, packaging, publishing and media. Our response to the decline in science in schools has been to recruit humanities and arts students and develop the necessary skills in a practical environment. This has been successful, with many such students succeeding in technology. The article talks about 'work experience in return for low wages'. While this may be an option for schools and short placements, it is not viable for a year out in industry during a sandwich degree. Our students receive no grant for their year out. They have to earn their keep and usually do, being paid between Pounds 6,000 and Pounds 18,000. An element of added value for a placement is that the student returns to college to develop a project which can build on the training experience. Many of these have been of great benefit to companies, resulting in important product development. One practice which is to be commended has been for companies to take a placement student and, if the student is satisfactory, to sponsor him or her during their final year with a view to employment at the end. Finally, in recent meetings companies have stressed the need for flexible, technologically literate graduates who understand the relationships between traditional print technologies and the increasingly digitally based design and production process. No doubt this is as true in other industries as it is in printing. Anthony Quinn, scheme director, BSc Graphic Media Studies, West Herts College, Watford, Herts WD1 1EZ</p>

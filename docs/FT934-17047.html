			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Appetisers Weekend FT has received a sackload of mail, following Nicholas Lander's article last week, on how to deal with a partner or colleague who falls asleep in a restaurant. Just how widespread is this phenomenon is reflected in readers' letters from Spain, Switzerland, Japan, the US and, of course, the UK. Some of your replies and anecdotes were hilarious. We will be printing a selection of them in next Saturday's Weekend FT and announcing the winner of our pink champagne prize for best letter. Dine-a-Mite is a new charity established to help the hungry and homeless in Great Britain through the hospitality industry. Its opening event takes place on the evening of Sunday October 17 when more than 11,000 hotels and restaurants, covering every type of cuisine and price bracket, will open their doors and donate 50 per cent of their takings to the charity. To locate a participating restaurant there is a special helpline: for restaurants in London tel: 0891-515525, outside London: 0839-300200. Calls charged at 48p per minute peak time, 36p at all other times. Richard and Peter Harden have launched Harden's London Party Guide (Pounds 6.95), a book that fills an obvious void at this time of year. It lists more than 900 venues for functions, from the private rooms of restaurants and hotels to the magnificent Wallace Collection museum and Wembley Greyhound Stadium. Another section covers costs, caterers, party planners and party shops. Winemakers from Robert Mondavi, Beringer, Saintsbury and Stag's Leap Wine Cellars in California's Napa Valley, are taking time off from their fermenting vats next week and pouring complimentary glasses of their best wines to lunchtime customers at Stephen Bull's Bistro EC1 (490-1970), Christopher's, WC2, (240-4222), Zoe, W1, (224-1122), Le Pont de la Tour, SE1, (403-8403), and Ransome's Dock, SW11 (223-1611). Fresh foie gras is available in London at the delicatessen counter of Selfridges in Oxford Street and at Vivians, 360 Kings Road, SW3. You can either buy it by the 2oz slice (about Pounds 3.50) or in a 14 oz roll for about Pounds 24. It comes from the Landes in southern France. The French often fry it in butter and serve it on a bed of warm lettuce leaves. You can be more adventurous: the chef at the Complete Angler, in Marlow, Bucks, uses it as a stuffing for partridge en croute.</p>

			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC moves on single banana market THE European Commission yesterday made a first attempt to agree on how to create a single market in bananas and comply with General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) tariff prescriptions for farm trade. The Brussels executive has still to reach a consensus on on how to deal with this sensitive issue, and a decision is not likely for two to three weeks. The EC has to decide how to protect banana imports entering duty free from high cost producers in its outlying territories and former colonies to which it has treaty obligations under the Lome convention. At the same time, the Uruguay Round trade negotiations require the EC to set a tariff for so-called 'dollar bananas'. Dollar fruit, mostly from low-cost plantations in Central America and Colombia, is subject to import restrictions, and a 20 per cent duty everywhere in the EC except Germany. Dollar bananas already command three fifths of the 3.3m tonnes EC market, and Caribbean producers fear their industry would be wiped out unless the protection they enjoy under the Lome Convention is maintained. Among the 12 member states, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece favour either seeking a derogation from Gatt or quota restraints on dollar bananas analagous to limits on Japanese car imports. The broadly free market camp in the Commission is backing instead a high, degressive tariff on the Latin American fruit to allow the EC's traditional suppliers time to adjust. One suggestion is to make the tariff the difference between the highest import price from EC banana zones and the lowest import price from dollar zones - a duty of more than Ecu350 per tonne. Caribbean producers are lobbying intensively against tariffication. But bananas, several Commission officials suspect, could easily put paid to a Uruguay Round deal, at least for this year. The Round is already tottering because of fundamental differences between the EC and the US and other agri-exporters over farm subsidy cuts. But an EC failure to 'tariffy' bananas could unravel the package so far assembled, officials say.</p>

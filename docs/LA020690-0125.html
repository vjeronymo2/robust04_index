			<p><P> February 6, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RIZZITELLO'S CASE MAY GO TO JURY TODAY;  </P> <P> TRIAL: BOTH SIDES HAMMER AWAY IN CLOSING ARGUMENTS, WITH THE DEFENSE CONTENDING  THAT A MURDERED MUSTANG BAR BOUNCER, GEORGE YUDZEVICH, SHOT WILLIAM CARROLL.  </P> <P> William Carroll, the major investor in the now-defunct Mustang topless bar, had  no reason to lie when he accused Michael Anthony Rizzitello of shooting him  three times in the head, leaving him permanently blind, a prosecutor told  jurors Monday.  </P> <P> In closing arguments at Rizzitello's trial on attempted murder charges, Deputy  Dist. Atty. Christopher J. Evans contended that Carroll kept quiet for 18  months after the shooting "because he was scared."  </P> <P> "He's afraid from the get-go," Evans said. "You gotta presume that they are  going to come finish you off."  </P> <P> Carroll, 57, was found in a pool of blood shortly after midnight on May 1,  1987, in an empty parking garage near the Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa.  He refused to tell investigators who shot him until Oct. 6, 1988, when  bank-fraud charges against him were reduced to a misdemeanor with no jail time,  fine or probation.  </P> <P> Carroll said that the gunman had been Rizzitello, a reputed Los Angeles  racketeer with a long record of arrests and convictions, and that Joey Grosso  had held him down while the shots were fired. Grosso was convicted last year in  the shooting.  </P> <P> Carroll told investigators that he had initially kept silent because he feared  that if he had been incarcerated in the bank-fraud case, Rizzitello would have  had him killed in Orange County Jail.  </P> <P> But in his arguments to the jury, Rizzitello's attorney contended that Carroll  kept quiet about the shooting until he could make a deal with prosecutors --  naming Rizzitello in return for leniency in the fraud case.  </P> <P> "Was there a deal made?" defense attorney Anthony P. Brooklier asked the  jurors. He said the proximity between the time Carroll's case was decided and  his meeting with investigators suggests that there was a deal.  </P> <P> The jurors are unaware that Rizzitello, 62, is a reputed underboss in the  Milano crime family in Los Angeles and has been arrested eight times in the  last 13 years. Though he has been acquitted in his last three trials,  Rizzitello was one of five Milano members to be convicted in a major  racketeering case in 1980.  </P> <P> The jurors are scheduled to begin deliberations today after receiving  instructions from Superior Court Judge John L. Flynn Jr.  </P> <P> Prosecutors contend that Rizzitello wanted to eliminate Carroll so that he  could pressure bar manager Gene Lesher for a share of the bar's profits. To  support that, Lesher testified that after Carroll was shot, Rizzitello used  threats of violence to muscle in on Mustang profits. Lesher said he paid $5,000  a week in cash to George Yudzevich, a bouncer at the club, who would pass the  money to Rizzitello.  </P> <P> The defense contends, however, that it was Yudzevich -- who has since been  murdered -- who shot Carroll, and that it was Lesher and Yudzevich who cooked  up the scheme to skim money from the club.  </P> <P> Lesher testified that after the Carroll shooting, he was called to Las Vegas by  Grosso and Yudzevich. He said they told him that Rizzitello was behind it. A  few days later, Lesher said, Rizzitello ordered him to a meeting at the Balboa  Bay Club, where he announced that he was going to cut in on the profits.  </P> <P> Brooklier argued that it's fair to look at who had fled after the shooting.  </P> <P> "It wasn't Mr. Rizzitello who flew to Las Vegas immediately afterwards,"  Brooklier said. "It was Grosso, Lesher and Yudzevich."  </P> <P> The defense's key witness was a dancer at the topless bar, who said Yudzevich  told her that he had shot Carroll.  </P> <P> But prosecutor Evans brought in receipts to show that Yudzevich was still in  Las Vegas at the time that the dancer, Marie McAfee, said she had talked with  him at John Wayne Airport about the shooting.  </P></p>

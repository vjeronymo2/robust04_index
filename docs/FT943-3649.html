			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Video on demand set for take-off A California company is planning to intensify competition for the world in-flight entertainment market by taking video-on-demand above 30,000 ft for the first time. Micropolis Corporation, which specialises in video-on-demand technology, has signed a deal which should lead to the introduction of the film of your choice, when you want it, on Pacific flights from next year. Showing films on long haul flights is routine but the Micropolis system means that around 20 feature films will be instantly available to passengers. They will be able to choose a film when they are ready and can pause or play back the screening as desired. The system is sophisticated enough to serve all the first and club class passengers simultaneously - typically around 96 people - even if everyone choses the same film. A similar service will be available to economy class passengers for a fee. Mr Stu Mabon, chief executive of Micropolis, which has UK offices at Reading, Berks, said yesterday he would announce the deal at the World Aviation Entertainment Association's annual convention in Montreal next month. He declined to say whom the deal was with but it is believed to be with Matsushita, the Japanese consumer electronics group which has an in-flight equipment division. The first airline to use the system is expected to be Singapore Airlines. The system, an airline version of the AV Server 100, will be demonstrated at the IBC broadcasting convention in Amsterdam this month, Mr Mabon said. Micropolis says the system has already gone live in seven hotels in the US including the Omni Richardson and Grand Kempinski in Dallas, Texas in partnership with SpectraVision, the hotel entertainment company. Mr Mabon said it appeared that offering guests a wide choice of films when they wanted them had nearly doubled film revenues in the hotels which have the system.</p>

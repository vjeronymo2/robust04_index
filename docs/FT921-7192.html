			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / South African Conservatives may boycott constitution referendum SOUTH AFRICA's white supremacist Conservative party has threatened to boycott the referendum proposed by President FW de Klerk to test white support for a post-apartheid constitution. Mr de Klerk's position in the poll could be strengthened by signs that his ruling National party and the African National Congress (ANC) have moved closer to agreement on an interim government which would rule until a post-apartheid constitution is drawn up. A deal on interim government which gives the Nationalists a large share of power could help persuade reluctant whites to vote yes in the referendum. The date of the poll - and the phrasing of the referendum question - are due to be announced formally today or tomorrow. However, the South African Press Association, quoting sources in the NP, said yesterday that it would be held on March 17. After several by-election defeats to the opposition Conservatives, who support a return to apartheid, Mr de Klerk is seeking a mandate to continue negotiating a new constitution within the multi-party forum called the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa). The Conservatives refuse to negotiate power-sharing with blacks. They have imposed conditions for their participation in the referendum - such as counting of votes by constituency, a method which would heavily favour them  -and will decide whether to participate when the referendum question is announced. To boycott the poll would, however, appear a tacit defeat for the Conservatives. Over the weekend, it emerged that negotiators had made rapid progress on the question of interim government, with the ANC believed to be ready to agree in principle to an elected interim government and executive, which would effectively be run jointly by itself and the government. Pretoria is understood to have proposed that parties gaining at least 5 per cent electoral support would be represented in an interim legislature, while 15 per cent support would be required for the entry to cabinet. This is likely to mean a cabinet composed only of the ANC and Nationalists. The Nationalists appear willing to compromise on the issue of special representation for whites and other minorities in parliament for the interim period, because whites would be strongly represented in the executive. In a permanent parliament, domination by one political group (effectively blacks) would be prevented by devolving powers to regional governments, as well as by enforced multi-racial power sharing in cabinet. The exact shape of the interim government, and its duration has yet to be agreed.</p>

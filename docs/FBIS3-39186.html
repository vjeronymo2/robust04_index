			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed RF: "Still No Belgians for Air Strikes"] </F>   [Excerpt] Brussels -- Defense Minister Leo Delcroix has  already adopted measures to enhance the safety of the Belgian  troops in Bosnia. He believes that there is little chance of  Belgium having to take part in air strikes.    In the House of Representatives during question time, Mr.  Delcroix was grilled on the subject of the safety of Belgian  troops in the Croatian area of Baranja, and in Central Bosnia,  following the NATO ultimatum imposed at 1300 on Friday [11  February]. He stated that "we are 100 percent behind the  decision made by NATO," but added that "the safety of our troops  comes first."    The minister warned against issuing orders from within one's  own country to troops who are operationally under the command of  UN generals Rose and Cot [in Bosnia], "as other countries  sometimes do." He also denied that plans to withdraw the  peacekeeping forces and humanitarian aid missions were already  being considered.    The Ministry of Defense, the Army, and UN command were  already doing their utmost to ensure the safety of the Belgian  troops, he continued. For instance, the troops were now better  armed. In the Baranja region, they would henceforth be equipped  with Milan rockets (that can destroy a tank from a distance of 2  km), and with armored vehicles. The roughly 750 troops in the  Baranja area have been concentrated from 12 sites to just five.    Minister Delcroix later stated that he had not completely  ruled out the possibility of Belgium supplying additional troops  for NATO air strikes at a later stage, but stated that this was  not the case for the time being.

			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Leasing rejected for five collieries British Coal has decided against offering the five pits earmarked last week for closure to the private sector on a lease and licence basis. The five pits are Ellington, in Northumberland, Ollerton, Manton and Annesley in Nottinghamshire, and Goldthorpe in South Yorkshire. Executives are debating whether to include the mothballed pits in the five packages they are preparing for the industry's privatisation later this year. That would give purchasers the option of re-opening them if they thought the market warranted it. The other option would be to offer the pits for sale as stand-alone pits. In the past year British Coal has offered 27 pits for leasing and licensing after closing them. Time and resource constraints influenced its decision to treat differently the pits earmarked for closure last week. The corporation is already working on the content of the five packages. Putting out five more pits on a tender basis would have caused confusion for prospective buyers of the packages, British Coal believes. The leasing and licensing of the 28 pits has attracted a surprisingly large amount of interest from private-sector companies. Of the first 19 pits that were put out to tender, six are now either in the hands of the private sector or soon will be. About 700 of the 1,100 miners at Ellington voted at a meeting yesterday not to accept the planned closure later this month. The decision means that the pit's future will now be decided through the industry's colliery review procedure, which could delay closure for nine months.</p>

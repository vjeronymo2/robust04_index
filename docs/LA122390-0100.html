			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRINCIPAL, ADMINISTRATOR RESIGN OVER SEX SCANDAL  </P> <P> The Norwalk-La Mirada school board accepted the resignations last week of an  elementary school principal and a district administrator six weeks after it was  disclosed that a district security guard allegedly discovered the two having  sex on school grounds.  </P> <P> At a special closed-door session Wednesday, the board accepted the resignations  of La Pluma Elementary School Principal Michael Newcomb and Christine  Roubidoux, the district's director of elementary programs, according to board  attorney James Baca.  </P> <P> Norwalk-La Mirada Unified School District officials said a security guard  allegedly found the two having sex in Newcomb's office one Sunday last fall.  Newcomb and Roubidoux have neither publicly confirmed nor denied the  allegations.  </P> <P> "Both employees have tendered resignations effective Jan. 31, 1991," Baca said  Thursday. "Other than that, we are not at liberty to comment any further."  </P> <P> News of the resignations angered parents of pupils at the La Mirada elementary  school, many of whom have accused the district of overreacting to the  allegations. Parents recently collected 250 signatures in support of the  popular principal and have called on the school board to hold a special public  session to discuss the incident.  </P> <P> "I am appalled by the decision, and I know a lot of other parents will be too,"  said Pam Severns, a parent who works lunchtime and recess duty at the school.  "I feel the board pressured them into resignation. . . . They were two  consenting adults on their own time, and the only indiscretion was location. I  had really hoped that the board would come up with some kind of alternative,  maybe just move him to another school or demote him."  </P> <P> Newcomb and Roubidoux have been on paid administrative leave since the  allegations were leaked to a local weekly newspaper last month. Both will  continue to be paid through Jan. 31, but Baca would not say whether the  district agreed to any other financial terms. District officials have routinely  declined to discuss the allegations, saying they involve confidential personnel  matters.  </P> <P> Baca said earlier that Newcomb and Roubidoux had "requested the opportunity of  resignation" and attorneys for both sides were working out the details.  </P> <P> Newcomb, reached at his home in Tustin, would not comment on the district's  announcement. His attorney, George William Shaeffer Jr., did not return phone  calls, and efforts to reach Roubidoux were unsuccessful.  </P></p>

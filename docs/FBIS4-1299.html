			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] A man is being detained for questioning in  connection with the spate of bomb explosions during the last two  days. This information was announced by the deputy minister of  law and order, Mr. Gert Myburgh. [passage omitted]    [Begin recording] [Freedom Front leader General Constand  Viljoen] The security situation in our country is critical, and  I believe that the levels of violence have overtaken any level  at which one can have an election and later say the election was  free and fair. It is a pity, because we have been hoping all  along that we could have constitutional peace with all the  groups before continuing with the process.    [Afrikaner Resistance Movement member Fred Rundle] It is not  our people. I do not know who it is. You must remember that  there are literally hundreds of organizations which, just like  ours, do not want to fall under a communist government. And  these people -- it can be any one of these people. I do not  know who it is. [end recording]    The Democratic Party has expressed condolences with the next  of kin of those killed in the bomb blasts. The PAC  [Pan-Africanist Congress] has said the attacks follow a pattern  as the targets have been groups of black people or offices used  by liberation groups. The party has asked voters to vote for the  sake of peace and wisdom.</p>

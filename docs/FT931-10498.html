			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Kingfisher bid terms due shortly MERGER talks announced last Thursday between Kingfisher, the UK retailer, and Darty, the French electrical goods chain, are continuing and terms of the deal are expected to be announced within the next few weeks. Analysts expect Kingfisher to offer a mixture of cash and shares to value Darty at about Pounds 1bn. Kingfisher is likely to pay FFr1.6bn in cash, as well as assuming about Pounds 500m of the French company's debt. Darty would be left with about 12 per cent of Kingfisher's shares, according to French press reports over the weekend. Analysts have also reduced their estimates for the size of a Kingfisher rights issue needed to help finance the deal. Kingfisher's shares fell 31p to 527p last week on fears the company would need to raise about Pounds 800m. Analysts now say the rights issue may be less than half that amount. Kingfisher has refused to comment on the terms of the deal. Kingfisher owns the Woolworth and Superdrug chains as well as Comet, Britain's second largest electrical retailer.</p>

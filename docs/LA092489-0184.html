			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOUSTON TOO MUCH FOR ARIZONA ST.;  </P> <P> COUGARS ROLL UP YARDAGE, PENALTIES, TURNOVERS, INTERCEPTIONS  </P> <P> Andre Ware threw for a school-record 497 yards and two touchdowns while Chuck  Weatherspoon scored on a 32-yard run and a 58-yard punt return as No. 17  Houston overcame a rash of miscues to beat Arizona State, 36-7, Saturday night.  </P> <P> The Cougars (2-0), idle since beating Nevada Las Vegas, 69-0, in their  season-opener Sept. 2, overcame seven turnovers, a school-record 23 penalties  and 236 yards in penalties to defeat the Sun Devils (2-1) for the first time  here since 1952.  </P> <P> Houston, with its run-and-shoot offense, rolled up 414 of its 744 yards in  total offense by halftime and led, 19-7, as it ended a five-game losing streak  against Arizona State.  </P> <P> The total yardage by the Cougars set a Southwest Conference record and was the  most allowed by Arizona State in its 91-year football history.  </P> <P> Ware, a junior, completed 24 of 41 passes for 310 yards in the first half and  finished 40 of 68 with four interceptions. His attempts and completions also  set school records.  </P> <P> Houston lost three fumbles, had a punt blocked and missed both an extra point  and a 31-yard field goal.  </P> <P> Ware had a two-point conversion pass batted away and was intercepted at the  Arizona five-yard line, one-yard line and twice in the Sun Devil end zone.  </P> <P> Arizona State had five turnovers -- all on interceptions -- and was held to  just 145 yards total offense.  </P> <P> Weatherspoon, who rushed for 122 yards in 10 carries, also scored on a punt  return with 12:07 remaining in the game.  </P> <P> Kurt Lasher, a redshirt freshman making his first start, completed only seven  of 20 passes for 90 yards with three interceptions. He was forced into the  lineup because junior starter Paul Justin missed the game with a sprained left  shoulder.  </P></p>

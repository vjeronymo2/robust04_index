			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish  at 1600 GMT on 26 April carries its "Straight Talk" program with  host Osvaldo Rodriguez from JUVENTUD REBELDE, and guest Luis  Sexto from BOHEMIA magazine, on part two of: What Country Do We  Live In Today?    Rodriguez begins the discussion by saying that politically  and socially, Cuba is one of a kind: "We have a steep economic  crisis, yet we maintain political stability; and why not say it  -- social stability as well. Cuba is the only such case."    Sexto points out that Cuba's political present cannot be  judged without considering its past. He says: "Never have I seen  in any other country such a solid bond between past and present;  between history and history-in-the-making." He goes on to say  that: "Despite shortages that are in some aspects acute, but not  tragic; despite deficits; despite sacrifices; and despite the  postponement of legitimate individual and social dreams, the  Cuban people are aware that there is no other political system  or political idea that would guarantee what they themselves have  lived during the past 35 years.    "This is part of the reasoning, even unconsciously, of any  Cuban today. What alternative does Cuba have today if not to  remain bonded to the political idea of the Revolution? What  other options do we have? The option proposed by the people in  Miami who support annexation? The most progressive of the Miami  annexation supporters are proposing private property and a  market economy." Rodriguez replies: "I recently read in the  Miami NUEVO HERALD an article going beyond that, proposing for  1994, U.S. annexation as a solution to our problems." Sexto  notes that some say that socialism has failed in Cuba, adding:  "That is something that remains to be seen. What completely  failed 35 years ago in Cuba was capitalism."    Rodriguez stresses that history is a factor in analyzing  attitudes Cubans assume today in contending with the situation.  He points out that despite the shortages, the situation in Cuba  is far removed from that of many Latin American countries  because Cuba is trying to maintain an equilibrium in terms of  social services.    Rodriguez and Sexto discuss the importance of the ration  booklet in Cuba's present situation. Rodriguez points out: "I  believe the ration booklet is an element of that equilibrium you  mentioned." Sexto responds: "The ration book is precisely an  element that favors distribution equilibrium. I am not an enemy  of the ration book, but I believe that getting rid of it someday  will benefit us all. I have had that opinion for years. But  right now, the ration booklet guarantees minimal distribution  and equilibrium in distribution." Rodriguez disagrees with  Sexto's point of view: "I do not agree with you. I believe the  ration booklet must be maintained because it is what guarantees  goods for people with lower incomes."    Sexto says that in Cuba they are working hard to cover basic  needs. He adds: "We are trying to avoid anyone's being abandoned  or anyone's literal starving to death. I do not believe that  anyone in this country is literally starving to death because in  one way or another, they get what they need. It has a lot to do  with our policies. We have a policy that favors the services and  views of social justice and protection."    In discussing these policies of social justice, Rodriguez  says: "We have only one option: To stay with the Revolution and  sacrifice ourselves to maintain our independence and dignity.  Many of our leaders, including Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto  Robaina during his trips abroad, have said that anything can be  discussed here but our independence or the dignity of the Cuban  people."    Sexto adds: "If we look at the trend and the fact that the  country continues to survive after a three-year crisis, that it  remains standing with determination to overcome the crisis, this  means that this country, the Revolution, the government, and the  social regime that supports this country have the support of the  majority of the people. That is irrefutable proof. The fact that  we remain standing is irrefutable proof that the majority of  Cubans support the Cuban Revolution. The fact that the majority  of people support the Cuban Revolution does not mean that there  is no irritation. I believe there is a certain level of  irritation in the streets.    I believe that everyone can take the shortages, the deficit,  but not everyone can take these challenges with a rational,  serene, and stable attitude. I believe there are times when the  irritation is produced because -- and I believe you said this  during a recent program -- I get home, for example, and there is  no power. I might get upset because maybe I wanted to read a  good book or write an article for the magazine. I am not just  talking about myself; I am referring to any citizen. This does  not mean that deep down I do not understand the causes for the  outages. I say to myself that this is what I must go through so  we can overcome this situation, because the other option is not  in my best interest. The other option is capitalism, which is  offered to us by some in Miami, and by some who leave us, to  back them up."    Rodriguez remarks: "With capitalism, everyone knows that  some  will benefit while the majority will drown."    Sexto says he was once asked what capitalism is. He  answered:  "The underground economy is the capitalist economy." Rodriguez  adds that capitalism's equilibrium is established by the law of  the market: "A market economy is the underground economy, where  the price is determined by the supply and demand, regardless of  who can or cannot buy those goods."    Rodriguez says: "We are living in a country facing a  difficult economic crisis, a country that despite its economic  crisis, lives in social equilibrium and political stability." He  concludes: "I will define the country we live in. We live in a  country that struggles to be better, to overcome, and to defend  itself." Straight Talk ends at 1615 GMT.</p>

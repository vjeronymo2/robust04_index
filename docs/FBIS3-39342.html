Mr Jean-Claude Piris, head of the European Council's legal  service, says the Maastricht Treaty is partly to blame. New  procedures and rules have turned the EU into a "veritable  labyrinth."    According to a paper circulating in Brussels, Mr Piris  argues  that reforms under way, though useful, do not go far enough.  "In order to be genuinely accepted and properly understood, the  system ought to be profoundly reformed one day, so as to move  toward more transparency."    Mr Piris was involved in drafting the Maastricht Treaty. He  also devised the formula which allowed the Danish government to  argue it had won legally binding opt-outs, securing a decisive  win in a second referendum last year.    Mr Piris concedes reform of decision-making will be  difficult  because it implies a choice between those favouring deeper  integration and those, such as the UK, preferring looser  inter-governmental co-operation.    The complex, opaque nature of decision-making in Brussels  results from the need to compromise between these forces, not  because of anonymous "diplomats and technocrats" who took part  in the Maastricht negotiations, he says.    Mr Piris suggests several reforms:    1. A "single, shorter, more readable treaty" which would  consolidate texts such as the Treaty of Rome, Single European  Act, Maastricht and others governing EU operation.    2. Clearer demarcation of areas of responsibility for  Council, Commission and Parliament, as well as between the Union  and member states.    3. Modification of decision-making processes. Ministers  involved in decision-making must at present follow at least 20  different procedures within Maastricht's framework.    4. Streamlining the way the EU acts and is represented  abroad. This could mean a seat for the EU at General Agreement  on Tariffs and Trade talks in Geneva rather than separate  national seats.    In his paper, Mr Piris argues strongly that the EU has done  more to improve efficiency, transparency, and democracy than  first realised.    He points to new powers gained by the European Parliament  for  scrutinising the European Commission; the creation of a European  Ombudsman; publication of the Commission's legislative programme  in the Official Journal in Brussels; and improved access to the  public for official documents.</p>

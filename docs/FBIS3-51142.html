			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Comandante Marcos, Mexican Indios rebel </F> leader, by Roger Gutierrez Diaz in San Cristobal, Mexico; date  not given: "Comandante Marcos" --first paragraph is LA STAMPA  introduction -- copyrighted by LA JORNADA]    [Text] San Cristobal -- I walked through the doorway of the  town hall occupied by the Zapatist National Liberation Army  [EZLN] guerrillas, and asked for Comandante Marcos. After being  let through by an Indio woman holding a rifle, I went up to the  second floor. Everything had been destroyed. Only the  chandeliers hanging from the ceiling were intact.    [Diaz] Your troops do not seem to be strong enough to march  on Mexico City and overthrow President Carlos Salinas de  Gortari. Are you not being too optimistic?    [Marcos] Look, if you are worried that we may be marching on  Mexico City, rest assured. We will wait for a little while  longer. Anyway, speaking seriously, I can assure you that what  you see here, in San Cristobal, is only a fraction of our  troops, most of which nobody can identify since, in the  countryside, they wear no uniform. There are more Zapatists in  the Indio communities than you or the government can imagine.  Therefore, we will not go to Mexico City with these forces  alone, but also with all the others which are gradually building  up.    [Diaz] Your weapons are much less powerful than the Army's.  Is this not an insurmountable handicap?    [Marcos] Our weapons are the people and our knowledge of  these mountains.    [Diaz] Where were you born?    [Marcos] I am Mexican, like all those who fight in the  Zapatist army, but I am not from Chiapas.    [Diaz] Where did you train to become a guerrilla?    [Marcos] I have trained a lot, but that is all I am prepared  to tell you. I am well aware of the difference between fighting  in the countryside and in towns, in the plains or the mountains,  in the jungle or the desert.    [Diaz] Where do you stand in relation to liberation  theology?    [Marcos] We are fighting to liberate ourselves alone,  without  any help from theology. Among our people, there are Evangelists  and Catholics, atheists, and witch-doctors alike. This story  about witch-doctors is not a joke. I am speaking of the Chiapas  witch-doctors.    [Diaz] Is the Zapatist army calling for new elections?    [Marcos] What is happening now, what they are doing to  bolster the new presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio, is  only a masquerade. We all know very well that the votes count  for nothing, and that the electoral law is a sham created by  Salinas, who is a usurper and a traitor. We want real  elections, in which all parties have a chance, not only the PRI  [Institutional Revolutionary Party].    [Diaz] There are indications that the "coletos," as San  Cristobal's inhabitants are nicknamed, are not all that happy  about this incursion in their town. In the streets, everybody  is repeating that violence leads nowhere. Does this type of  response from the people not worry you?    [Marcos] Of course, I would like them to respond somewhat  differently. But I would like to stress that those who are not  Indios, the so-called "coletos" and "ladinos," are very racist.  If one of them steps into a bus and a "Chamula" [Chamula  Indian] is seated, they make him get up. If they see an Indio  on the road, they step on the gas and barely miss him. If  people who behave like this disapprove of the Zapatist army, you  will understand that I am not in the least concerned. As far as  violence not leading to any results is concerned, I could answer  that it is precisely the institutional violence into which  Salinas has plunged the country, as well as violence in the form  of death from cholera, malaria and measles, violence in the form  of hunger and deprivation, which has led us to opt for this  extreme solution. We are not aiming to establish an autonomous  government, we are only demanding a democratically elected  government, and respect for all the indian tribes. Another  thing that I would like to make clear is that I am not the  Zapatists' leader. We do not have a head, but rather a  committee.</p>

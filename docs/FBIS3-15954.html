			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev by </F> correspondent Nikolay Svanidze; place and date not given; from  the "Details" program -- recorded]    [Text] [Svanidze] One knows that to a large extent Richard  Nixon discussed his meetings in Moscow with the present U.S.  leadership, including Clinton, as far as I understand. Another  thing, at a time when Yeltsin himself was in opposition, he had  meetings with top officials from other countries and received  them here. There were no problems then. What offended Boris  Nikolayevich this time? Why did he not receive Nixon?    [Kozyrev] I think the explanation here is very simple. I,  for example, heard that Nixon was in Moscow when he had already  arrived in Moscow. That is, the problem here lies in the  organization [of the visit] and Nixon should ask people in his  apparatus and, perhaps, complain to those people who invited him  to Moscow -- I don't know who it was, who was dealing with his  visit here -- as to why his program had been so ill thought-out.    There is a certain protocol. Protocol means certain respect  toward a state in question. The president was absolutely right  when he did not receive Nixon, because at the basis of his  program was disrespect toward Russian statehood, toward the  Russian state.    You know, his wanting to meet Rutskoy is roughly equivalent  to someone arriving at a respectable gathering and -- forgive me  for the analogy, but this matter needs to be presented quite  graphically -- wanting to use the toilet. One option is to say  excuse me, I will go out for a minute to make a telephone call  to my close friend. Everyone will understand this and there  will be no problem. Another option is to open wide the doors, to  begin with this and join the guests coming out of the toilet.  It is likely the guests will be offended. This is the whole  problem.    I think the problem does not lie in the fact that he has met  the opposition representatives or people who are more like  criminals rather than the opposition in this particular context.  The whole problem is that he did it wrong as regards  priorities, politeness, and good manners. I do not think this  is his personal problem, of course. He himself, perhaps, is not  even able to deal with such details. This is the problem of  those, I stress this once more, who had organized his visit and,  above all, his own apparatus.    [Svanidze] That is, this is the problem of his apparatus,  his  team, and those who invited him here, isn't it?    [Kozyrev] Absolutely correct.    [Svanidze] As far as I know, he was invited here by no one  else but Mr. Lobov, secretary of the Russian Security Council.    [Kozyrev] You seem to know more than I do.    [Svanindze] Andrey Vladimirovich, Boris Nikolayevich's  reaction -- can it be regarded as demonstration of toughness  toward the United States?    [Kozyrev] No, this has nothing to do with the United States.  I would like to tell you yet again that this problem was purely  ethical, it was the problem of the program and the team.    [Svanidze] One gets the impression, many experts and  political analysts, both Russian and non-Russian wrote this,  that relations between the two powers have become colder now  than what they were until very recently.    [Kozyrev] I am to meet Warren Christopher in Vladivostok in  the very near future, and we will discuss with the secretary of  state what form of partnership we should have. We should agree  on this so that it does not cause annoyance and so that it does  not come as a surprise, for example, when Russia comes out with  its own initiative.    We, on our part, feel offended sometimes -- why do they come  out with their initiative when we were supposed to agree on it  between ourselves first. So this should be clarified and the  mechanism of interaction should be finalized. I would not  dramatize it but I would not underestimate it either.    If, on the other side there is simply a desire to undermine  political partnership, and these are not simply problems of  growing up, so to speak, problems of mutual adjustment, but if  there is a political desire to give up partnership, this would  be a different matter. But one should be convinced of this  first.    [Svanidze] What is this new, tougher, more authoritative  Russian policy linked to? Can it be explained by foreign policy  or internal policy?    [Kozyrev] I would say neither the one nor the other. It is  simply appearing in a perhaps more mature form in line with the  restoration of the Russian state. But again, you know, we hear  this cheap criticism that consists of saying that foreign policy  is encountering certain difficulties.    But here it is forgotten that ours is a new state. We only  adopted a Constitution in December. Before that we were living  under the Soviet Constitution. You wouldn't know whether to  laugh or cry reading such a mess. So at last, then, we got a  new Constitution in December.    Our Russian statehood did, of course, take on a new quality  -- an authoritative quality, if you like. We are now setting  ourselves the full-scale task of strengthening the Russian state  -- a democratic state, and foreign policy accordingly.  Naturally, as the Russian state becomes more powerful -- and  when we get on top of the economic reforms, we will have a  powerful economy, whereas now our economy is weakened -- this  will become apparent in foreign policy. Not because we want this  or because we are under pressure from the opposition and so on  and so forth -- nothing of the sort. The opposition only gets  in the way of all of this. The opposition -- I mean the extreme  opposition, so to speak -- is getting in the way of setting up a  powerful statehood and consequently it weakens foreign policy.    You know, we are being constantly reminded of Zhirinovskiy.  We are told: You are talking tough because you are being  pressurized by Zhirinovskiy. Nothing of the sort. If we had  not been accused of acting to Zhirinovskiy's orders or being  under pressure from Zhirinovskiy, we would have talked even  tougher.    [Svanidze] Do you think of yourself as a party politician?  Do you think of yourself now as a member of Russia's Choice?    [Kozyrev] Well, let's not...    [Svanidze] Let's not what?    [Kozyrev] Let's not be specific about that. I was of course  a member of the Russia's Choice electoral bloc, if you will. I  have not rejected Russia's Choice, its common aims and so on.  But Russia's Choice is not yet a party, and a complicated  process to create a party as opposed to an electoral bloc is  under way, along with a difficult process of, let us say,  self-determination and crystallization of political currents,  and so I would not now say that I belong to any specific party.</p>

			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: History lesson spreads optimism / A look at the pattern of US bond yields in recessions Economists and bond market analysts feel that the current US recession is different from other post-war economic downturns. 'The months preceding the typical post-war recession are characterised by rising core inflation, rising interest rates and rising levels of inventories relative to sales,' said Mr Gerald Corrigan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve bank in the bank's annual report. 'None of those conditions prevailed in any significant way in the months preceding the downturn in economic activity last year. The roots of this recession can be traced more directly to a combination of events that precipitated a sharp decline in confidence and corresponding pull back in spending.' Against this background, measures of investor confidence take on extra significance. Equity prices provide a broad measure of anticipated growth in corporate earnings. A more sensitive gauge may be provided by corporate yield spreads (the extra yield on corporate bonds against government bonds) and credit spreads (the extra yield of bonds issued by weak companies against those issued by strong companies). When the economic outlook is bleak, corporate yield spreads against government bonds widen in anticipation of deteriorating credit quality. A recovery is prefaced by a tightening of spreads. Moreover, by looking at the yield spread between company bond issues of different credit quality, investors' perception of the risk to various areas of the economy can be judged. JP Morgan, the US securities house, calculates a number of industrial bond yield indices in the US market according to the credit quality of the issuer. These show that yield spreads and credit spreads have already peaked. 'Credit spreads usually start widening after the onset of a recession and reach a peak just before or after the end of a recession, at which point economic activity has reached a trough,' said Mr Jan Loeys, bond market analyst at JP Morgan. The yield spread between top-rated triple-A corporate bond issues and medium-grade Baa rated bond issues peaked at 192 basis points in December last year. The spread between the two credit grades has since steadily narrowed to 151 basis points. This compares favourably with the recession of the early 1980s, when the credit spread soared to 293 basis points as investors ran to the best quality bond issues. In contrast, the current downturn in confidence looks more serious than the recession of the early 1970s. In 1974 the yield spread between top-rated and weaker corporate bonds hit a peak of just 154 basis points, 40 basis points less than the 1990-91 peak. Weaker companies are seen to be more at risk than strong companies this time around. One explanation is that the financial system is no longer seen as a willing supplier of emergency credit to stretched industrial companies. 'This recession was different to the early 1980s or mid-1970s. Fears of a credit crunch and the high degree of leverage among US corporations were new factors, over and above depressed demand,' said Mr Loeys. Yet for top-rated triple-A companies, the yield spread over government bonds widened to a peak of just 70 basis points against 197 basis points in 1974. For those companies in good financial health, with low gearing and strong cash flow, the current recession is seen as a less serious threat than in the early 1970s. There are pitfalls in taking this analysis too far. For example, the credit-rating agencies were aggressive in their downgrading of companies coming into this recession, so the data may not be strictly comparable. However, the tightening of yield spreads and credit spreads, during the last two months in particular, suggests a definite upswing in investor confidence.</p>

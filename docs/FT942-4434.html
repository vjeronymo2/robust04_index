			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Green' alliance comes to aid of Australia's degraded land Australian farmers are being encouraged to tackle some of the huge environmental problems facing their country's agricultural industry through a series of local initiatives called Landcare. Mr Andrew Campbell, a former Landcare co-ordinator, told a seminar in London yesterday organised by the Sustainable Agriculture, Food and Environment Alliance, that Landcare had attracted more than a third of Australian farmers with 2,000 groups set-up nationwide. European farming methods in Australia have caused many of the environmental problems as they are unsuited to the continent's fragile soils and unpredictable rainfall. Land degradation such as salinity, erosion and soil structure decline affects over half of the nation's farmland at a cost of more than ADollars 2.5bn a year, according to Safe. Landcare groups consist of farmers, environmentalists, teachers and local people, providing a useful social role as well as tackling environmental problems. Mr David Clark, who farms 250 hectares of grassland in South-eastern Victoria, runs one group which includes 120 farms and covers 40,000 hectares. 'In the past five years we've dramatically changed 40 to 50 per cent of the landscape in our area, but it will take 30 years to solve the big problems,' Mr Clark said. Around 2 per cent of the land in Victoria is covered with salt and cannot be farmed. At the same time, there is erosion of the land into huge gullies extending over 500km. 'Most farmers don't like to see their land like this - they can't produce on it and don't want to live with it like this,' Mr Clark stressed. His group has begun to attract urban dwellers who are keen to get to know the countryside as well as local residents in a forum that promotes understanding of the farming community. Since Australian agriculture is not subsidised, the Landcare programme only has government funding of ADollars 40m a year for setting up groups and providing demonstration projects. Farmers do not receive aid for environmental measures. One of the strengths of the Landcare movement is its local focus - groups concentrate on local issues and solutions that are relevant in that particular area. Different groups are interested in varying issues. The most important role of Landcare according to Mr Clark is that it's 'making farmers environmentalists'.</p>

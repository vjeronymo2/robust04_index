			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei drops back below 18,000 on profit-taking JAPANESE shares ran into profit-taking after the Nikkei average's 1,680-point surge over the previous four sessions, agencies report from Tokyo. The Nikkei closed 321.06, or 1.8 per cent, down at 17,740.06, after a day's low of 17,699.72 and high of 18,059.21. Declines outnumbered advances by 751 to 285, while 82 issues were unchanged. Volume was estimated at 550m shares, down from 564.5m registered on Monday. The Topix index of all first sec-tion stocks slipped 15.24 to 1,370.27, while in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index lost 6.11 to 1,086.07. Traders said the Nikkei's downside was probably limited to 17,500 as sentiment remained buoyant in the wake of the government's fiscal stimulus package. However, they added that selling pressure remained heavy above 18,000. Mr Hiroyuki Maki, a trader with County NatWest Securities, said that with the Nikkei at 18,000, and price/earnings ratios above 45, 'the market does not look cheap'. With companies cutting their earnings forecasts for the current fiscal year, the ratios could soon exceed 50, he added. Individuals and dealers dominated trading, with Aids-related shares attracting the most interest. Meiji Milk accounted for roughly 9 per cent of the day's turnover as it advanced Y50 to Y1,110. Mochida Pharmaceutical climbed Y160 to Y3,690. Other sectors which had risen sharply over the previous two weeks fell on profit-taking. Mitsubishi Estate dropped Y53 to Y957 and Mitsui Real Estate Y40 to Y1,040. Blue chip electricals were mostly softer, although the latest downward earnings revisions did not have a big effect. Hitachi dipped Y11 to Y786 and Toshiba shed Y18 to Y620. Takashimaya weakened Y40 to Y1,000 after a newspaper reported that the company will suffer a 48 per cent drop in pre-tax profits in the current fiscal year. Carmakers lost ground following the domestic car sales data for August that showed a 16.3 per cent fall from a year ago, the sharpest decline since November 1980. Toyota Motor receded Y30 to Y1,420 and Mazda Y15 to Y450. Roundup TOKYO'S retreat prompted profit-taking in the Pacific Basin region. TAIWAN finished slightly higher as investors became cautious after the recent rises. The weighted index put on 14.10 at 3,960.45 as turnover decreased to TDollars 25.56bn from Monday's TDollars 29.5bn. Slight profit-taking was seen but major players and institutions traded actively, encouraging small investors. China Steel, strong in the past two days, relinquished 30 cents to TDollars 17.50 on profit-taking. HONG KONG closed firmer after an early decline, selling orders having dried up by mid-morning. The Hang Seng index gained a net 82.97 at 5,711.97 in turnover of HKDollars 2.7bn. The market was closed on Monday. HSBC Holdings led the actives list, rising HKDollars 2 to HKDollars 56.50 on the back of last week's results. MANILA fell further in listless trading as PLDT and Philippine National Bank continued to soften in reaction to the steady rise of the peso against the dollar. The composite index shed 9.75 to 1,366.91 in combined turnover of 163.36m pesos, after Monday's 144m. AUSTRALIA eased in quiet trading dominated by selling of industrial stocks. The All Ordinaries index finished 4.7 off at 1,542.5 in turnover of ADollars 168.2m. Lend Lease tumbled 30 cents to ADollars 14.00, extending its fall since its disappointing results last week to ADollars 1.90, while Brambles slid 56 cents to ADollars 14.98, a loss of ADollars 1.12 so far this week ahead of its financial results, due tomorrow. NEW ZEALAND rose slightly in light trading on the first day of spring, the NZSE-40 capital index firming 1.96 to 1,483.88 in turnover of around NZDollars 14.4m. Fletcher Challenge moved forward 4 cents to NZDollars 2.40 following late interest from Australian institutions. Fishing concern Sanford advanced 15 cents to NZDollars 5.10 on expectations that Sealord, Carter Holt's fishing company, will not now be floated. SINGAPORE closed easier on thin selling, the Straits Times Industrial index losing 3.08 to 1,375.46 in volume of 28.11m shares, up from 26.38m. KUALA LUMPUR retreated in the afternoon on profit-taking. The composite index ended 1.23 down at 573.50 after reaching an early high of 579.21. Volume fell to 31.4m shares from Friday's 51.1m. The market was shut on Monday. Tenaga Nasional was active as 1.5m shares changed hands. It closed steady at MDollars 9.65. SEOUL consolidated after a two-day rise. The composite index retreated 4.20 to 558.60 in turnover of Won639.6bn, up from Monday's Won428.2bn.</p>

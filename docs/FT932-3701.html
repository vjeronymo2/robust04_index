			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / The Long View: Evidence of duplicity SO NOW we know for sure what we have long suspected. Norman Lamont, while chancellor of the exchequer, was pursuing a policy of pegging sterling within the European exchange rate mechanism despite grave personal misgivings about what was one of his predecessor John Major's leftover policies. While telling the country there was not a scintilla of doubt about the government's ERM commitment, he was privately urging the prime minister to suspend membership. He was also, like Nigel Lawson before him, secretly recommending that the Bank of England should be given independent responsibility for setting interest rates. Where does all this evidence of duplicity and strategic disagreement leave the British government's credibility? There is, for instance, a commitment to hold inflation below 4 per cent, and a pledge to cut back the public sector borrowing requirement from its current year level of Pounds 50bn. It is not entirely clear whether these promises left over from his predecessor are worth the paper that Kenneth Clarke has not yet written them on. This week Clarke was breezily discussing the choice between raising taxation and cutting public spending (he will do neither, apparently) but the most important question is whether he will opt for the unspoken third option, to inflate his way out of trouble. The financial markets have stayed surprisingly calm during the turmoil in the top ranks of the British government. The sterling long bond yield has actually eased a little but remains close to 8 1/2 per cent, striking an awkward compromise between the 5 or 6 per cent which might be compatible with long-run low inflation and financial stability, and a double-digit return which would be required should the rate of destruction of the value of the currency edge up again to erode the public sector's debt burden. Yet, politicians must not be valued at their own estimate of their decision-taking ability. The reassuring thought for those who rely on the British government's readiness to honour its debts in real terms is that, in a world of freely exchangeable currencies, the scope for deviant policies is limited. The decision in 1990 to enter the ERM at the wrong rate, for instance, could not be sustained for long. A dash for inflationary growth would, similarly, lead to a market breakdown quite quickly. But what one government cannot do on its own, a number of countries might achieve collectively. This thought might be behind the recent nervous flutter in the gold bullion market and the surge of strength in the one leading currency - the Japanese yen - which is not burdened by the structural deficits which plague the dollar, the D-mark and the pound sterling, among others. The yen has appreciated by 54 per cent against sterling since last August. Just as the ERM proved a disappointment as a pre-packaged answer to the UK's economic problems, it is pretty certain that central bank independence would be a blind alley, too. The idea is that the central bank would cancel out the feckless tendency of vote-catching politicians to inflate rather than to tax. Unfortunately, the division of responsibility can also lead to a protracted domestic economic war in which fiscal laxity is offset by excessive monetary tightness. This became apparent in the US early in the 1980s, leading to a large over-valuation of the dollar. The same problem has afflicted Germany. It could easily happen in the UK, too, should the economic recovery pick up speed. It would be nice to think that British chancellors hanker after an independent Bank of England because they believe such an institution would improve economic governance in the UK. More likely, they see a chance to offload the blame for interest rate rises on somebody else. The idea seems to appeal more to chancellors than to prime ministers, who would bear overall responsibility for a policy mess. The clash between bankers and spenders leads to high real interest rates, which cancel out the stimulus which budget deficits might otherwise provide. Meanwhile, finance ministries in many countries, especially the US and the UK, are badly missing that important lubricant, inflation. The largely unanticipated fall in inflation means that tax revenues are coming in under budget, aggravating the deficit problems. In depressed conditions, short-term interest rates can come down (except, so far, in Germany) but long-term rates cannot, because such a vast volume of debt has to be sold. If the combination of debt deflation in the US and elsewhere and post-unification disruption in Germany continue to inhibit global economic recovery, it seems likely that a sharp fall in real interest rates must ensue, as part of the resolution of the crisis. How large a part inflation might play in that is, for investors at least, the crucial question. The first part of the political response is already becoming evident, as governments shrink from financing themselves with long-term debt: the US, for instance, has reduced the frequency of its 30-year bond auctions. There will be an increasing resort to short-term finance through the banking system. This will not prove to be inflationary so long as private sector credit demand remains depressed, but this tempting solution contains the seeds of trouble. It is not a path the British government would be able to pursue on its own, but it will follow eagerly in the footsteps of the Americans. The Germans, meanwhile, will go their own way if they can, as they did in the inflationary 1970s when the D-mark appreciated by 114 per cent against the dollar and 130 per cent against sterling; but as the German economy spirals downwards, the pressure on the Bundesbank may become intolerable. As Norman Lamont said ruefully this week, both the post-war Tory chancellors to have brought inflation below 2 per cent have been sacked. Clarke is unlikely to make the same mistake.</p>

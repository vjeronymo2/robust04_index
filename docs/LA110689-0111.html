			<p><P> November 6, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> TREASURY BILL AUCTIONS DELAYED  </P> <P> The Treasury Department postponed its scheduled weekly auction of three-month  and six-month bills today because of Congress' failure to raise the debt limit.  </P> <P> It was uncertain whether the Treasury would be able to go ahead with its  planned quarterly refunding later this week.  </P> <P> It tentatively had scheduled auctions of $10 billion in three-year notes on  Tuesday, $10 billion in 10-year notes on Wednesday and $10 billion in 30-year  bonds on Thursday.  </P> <P> The government's borrowing authority dropped from $2.87 trillion to $2.80  trillion last Tuesday.  </P> <P> The House has voted to raise the debt ceiling to $3.1 trillion for the current  fiscal year, but Senate legislation has been blocked by a squabble over whether  to cut the capital gains tax.  </P></p>

			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Uncertainty on return of Shonekan THE triumph of hope over experience may be the kindest assessment of Chief Ernest Shonekan's decision to accept the job as leader of Nigeria's interim government. The 57-year-old former industrialist and lawyer took on much the same duties when sworn in last January as chairman of the country's transitional administration, promising to revive Nigeria's lapsed structural adjustment programme. Eight months later the economy is deep in crisis and few if any of the promises were implemented. Mr Shonekan, one of the country's most respected businessmen, had been seconded from the chairmanship of United Africa Company Nigeria, the Unilever subsidiary, and drew heavily on the advice of the business community. The result was the 1993 budget - a ringing reaffirmation of the necessity of reform and the overriding need for prudent management. 'We must make some hard choices now to preserve the gains of the structural adjustment programme and restore some good measure of stability to the economy,' said Mr Shonekan. But his administration failed to tackle fundamental issues notably managing the exchange rate, reducing the budget deficit and cutting subsidies on domestic petrol. Hopes that Nigeria would reach an agreement with the IMF by August, which would allow rescheduling of the country's Dollars 34bn external debt proved to be wishful thinking. Within weeks it became apparent that he lacked the authority to implement tough decisions. Senior officials complained that power continued to lie in the hands of President Ibrahim Babangida and the military. Today, as in January, the challenge facing the new administration remains that of budgetary reform, and reducing a fiscal deficit averaging 7.7 per cent of GDP since the structural adjustment programme was launched seven years ago. The new administration will also have to tackle what is perhaps the most sensitive issue of all: monitoring the export earnings of nearly 2m barrels of oil a day. As much as 200,000 barrels a day are not properly accounted for. Some of the proceeds are diverted into special accounts for military expenditure, the Ajaokuta steel project or spending on the yet to be completed federal capital of Abuja, and an undisclosed amount used as patronage. Will the soldiers back the chief this time round? Mr Shonekan can point to one encouraging indicator: the decision earlier this week to raise domestic fuel prices ten-fold. But the government will be expected to put the budget blueprint into practice before agreement with the IMF can be reached. Such a track record would require at least six months before credibility is established. By then Nigeria, would be preparing for the re-run of presidential elections. At a time when continuity in policymaking is essential, Nigeria seems set for a further period of uncertainty.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Inkatha Freedom </F> Party president, in Ulundi by South African Broadcasting  Corporation announcer Freek Robinson in the Johannesburg studio,  on the "Agenda" program -- live]    [Text] [Robinson] Can you just tell me what is the absolute  minimum for you to settle tomorrow?    [Buthelezi] Well, the absolute minimum has been spelled out  on the document that we presented to the ANC [African National  Congress] and government on the 19 December, and that is  concerning the provinces, concerning the powers of provinces,  concerning the concurrents, concerning the fiscal powers,  concerning the single and double ballot system. Those are, I  think, the absolute minimum things that we would want to be put  right.    [Robinson] We have been discussing those things in our  studio  tonight, but what is the most important for you, or are all of  them as important and should a settlement be on all of those  points together, tomorrow?    [Buthelezi] I think all those points are equally important,  but I would say the single ballot and double ballot is a crucial  thing. I would think that, in fact, it could really be the thing  that will be decisive.    [Robinson] Dr. Buthelezi -- moving away from that -- if you  go ahead with your decision not to take part in the election,  will you nevertheless take part in the sense that you will  dissuade people to vote?    [Buthelezi] Well, I know that the ANC and the government, in  their collusion, have set traps for people who take action, in  fact, to dissuade people from voting so that minefield I  suppose.... [changes thought] I hope that I will not be forced  to walk that minefield, because it is a minefield, but I think  that the determination of the members of the IFP [Inkatha  Freedom Party], as I saw it throughout the night last until the  early hours of this morning, convince me that they are prepared  to walk that minefield than sacrifice, you know, their  principles for a massive (?portage).    [Robinson] Dr. Buthelezi, thank you very much for your  participation tonight. Obviously we don't have the time now to  have a long interview with you, but we'll try to create that  opportunity as soon as possible. Thank you for your  contribution.    [Buthelezi] Thank you, Mr. Robinson.</p>

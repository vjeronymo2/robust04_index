			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] A squadron of four Israeli warplanes twice  raided the positions of the Ahmad Jibril-led Popular Front for  the Liberation of Palestine-General Command in the al-Na'imah  Hills and al-Damur at 1205 and 1210 today. The warplanes fired  10 delayed action missiles. Following the raids, the enemy  warplanes broke the sound barrier over Beirut and flew at very  low altitude over the south. Today's Israeli raids are the  ninth since the beginning of the year.    A military source stated this afternoon that the Israeli  enemy launched several raids against the al-Na'imah hills. The  raids are continuing, the source added. Army units nearby are  confronting the raiding warplanes using available weapons.  Sources close to the Internal Security Forces have stated that  the enemy warplanes used the sea route to reach their targets.  The same sources added that an as yet unspecified number of  people have been hurt. The Internal Security Forces have asked  ambulances and Civil Defense teams to head for the area hit by  the raid to evacuate the wounded to the hospitals. [passage  omitted]    We have just received a report that the Israeli raids  against  the al-Na'imah hills resumed at 1315 this afternoon. The  Israeli warplanes are launching a raid every 10 minutes. Three  Palestinians have been wounded as a result. Since 1320, Israeli  warplanes have been flying over Sidon and the Palestinian camps  at medium altitude.</p>

The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Purpose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The intent of Rule 103A is to encourage a high level of market quality and performance in Exchange listed securities. Rule 103A grants authority to the Exchange's Market Performance Committee (``MPC'') to develop and administer systems and procedures, including the determination of appropriate standards and measurements of performance, designed to measure specialist performance and market quality on a periodic basis to determine whether or not particular specialist units need to take actions to improve their performance. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  Based on such determinations, the MPC is authorized to conduct a formal Performance Improvement Action in an appropriate case.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission originally approved the implementation of the Rule 103A pilot program in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 25681 (May 9, 1988), 53 FR 17287 (May 16, 1988) (order approving File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;87&hyph;25) and subsequently extended the effectiveness of Rule 103A in Release Nos. 28215 (July 17, 1990) (``July 1990 Order''), 55 FR 30060 (July 24, 1990) (order approving File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;90&hyph;24); 29180 (May 8, 1991), 56 FR 22498 (order approving File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;91&hyph;14) and 32285 (May 10, 1993), 58 FR 28905 (May 17, 1993) (``May 10 Order''). The July 1990 Order also approved various substantive revisions to Rule 103A including, among other things, enhancing the performance criteria for administrative messages received through the Designated Order Turnaround (``DOT'') system, and, at the same time, extended the effectiveness of the revised Rule 103A until May 9, 1991 [see Securities Exchange Act Release No. 28215]. Subsequently, on February 27, 1991, the Commission approved the NYSE's proposal to adopt relative performance standards into the Rule 103A program [see Securities Exchange Act Release No. 28923 (February 27, 1991), 56 FR 9993 (order approving File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;90&hyph;44)]. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On May 10, 1993, the SEC extended the effectiveness of Rule 103A until May 9, 1994. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  In this order, the Commission stated its belief that the Exchange should develop objective performance standards to measure specialist performance. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  In this regard, the Commission recently approved, on a one-year pilot basis, an objective measure of specialist performance dealing with specialist utilization of capital for market-making. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  This measure of performance focuses on a specialist unit's use of its own capital in relation to the total dollar value of trading activity in the unit's stocks. Tiered rankings based on a unit's capital utilization are provided to the Exchange's Allocation Committee as one of the objective measures it considers in allocating stocks to specialist units under its Allocation Policy and Procedures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32285,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission notes that the Exchange's current evaluation criteria under Rule 103A.10 include objective standards that measure specialist performance at the opening (both regular and delayed), systematized order turnaround, and the timeliness of a unit's response to status requests. Specialist performance also is measured by the Exchange's Specialist Performance Evaluation Questionnaire. However, objective market making measures currently are not included in the Rule 103A program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33369 (December 22, 1993), 58 FR 69431 (December 30, 1993). This measure of performance has not to date been incorporated into the Rule 103A evaluation program. See note 17,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> infra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange, with the assistance of outside consultants, continues to work to develop additional objective measures of specialist performance. As Rule 103A is working well, the Exchange requests that its effectiveness be extended for an additional year, until May 9, 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Statutory Basis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The statutory basis under the Act for this proposed rule change is the requirement under Section 6(b)(5) that an Exchange have rules that are designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. The proposed extension of Rule 103A is consistent with these objectives in that it will allow the Exchange to continue to administer the rule on an uninterrupted basis ensuring quality specialist performance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C.

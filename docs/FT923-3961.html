			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Devaluation drives up D-Mark BOTH THE dollar and sterling weakened further against the D-Mark yesterday after Finland broke the markka's link with the Ecu, sparking fears of a devaluation of the weaker currencies in the European Monetary System, writes James Blitz. Although it is not an EMS currency, the Finnish markka had been informally linked to the Ecu as part of Finland's strategy of applying for European Community membership. However, the overvaluation of the markka had led to high interest rates and a reduction in Finnish foreign currency reserves through intervention. The Bank of Finland devalued the currency by 14 per cent last November by floating it on the foreign exchanges for one day. Yesterday it repeated the move, but this time the bank's governor said it would take 'much longer than days or weeks' to see exactly what value the markka would have. By last night, the markka had effectively devalued by 13 per cent from its previous close against the Ecu. Its exchange rate was quoted at DM31.60 per 100 markka at the end of European trading, against a fixing on Monday of DM36.30. Finland's devaluation highlighted how small the global currency village has become. Sweden's central bank was immediately forced to put up its most important lending rate by 8 percentage points to protect the Swedish krona, which traders see as the next prime target for devaluation. Several analysts warned that the Swedish authorities cannot sustain such high rates for long. The devaluation also upset trading in an already troubled EMS. Sellers of Finnish markka mostly opted for D-Marks. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, also drove the D-Mark upwards by saying there was nothing new in a statement he had made at the weekend that the German central bank will not raise short-term interest rates again. Sterling fell to a low of DM2.7850, less than a pfennig above its ERM floor of DM2.7780, before finishing at DM2.7875, down  3/4 pfennig on the day. The dollar closed more than a pfennig lower in Europe, at DM1.3915, but in New York it picked up to end at DM1.3940. Traders anticipate a cut in the Federal Reserve's discount rate following last week's unexpectedly low figure for US non-farm payroll in August, and believe that the dollar could test its historic low again. In the short term, the pound remains well underpinned against the D-Mark, after the UK government's announcement last week that it is borrowing Ecu10bn to convert into sterling on the foreign exchanges. But the Treasury must be disappointed to see its borrowing plan overshadowed by so many ill-timed tremors in the currency markets.</p>

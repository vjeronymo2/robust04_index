			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Employers deserting milk round Graduate recruiters are abandoning the 'milk round' of visits to universities to recruit students as competition for jobs increases, careers advisers said yesterday. For every 100 bookings made with universities to meet students in 1990-91, only 38 were made this year, according to the Association of Graduate Careers Advisory Services. At the 'new' universities, which were polytechnics until last year, there have been only 24 bookings this year for every 100 in 1990-91. Ms Margaret Wallis, president of the association, said employers wanted graduates who were prepared to take the initiative in looking for work. Releasing its survey of destinations for graduates in 1992, the association said total graduate unemployment had risen to 12.9 per cent, from 11.5 per cent the previous year. Employers in fact recruited more graduates in 1992; the increased unemployment rate was caused by an rise of 9.7 per cent in graduate numbers. Ms Wallis said unemployment rates for school-leavers showed there was still a strong incentive for sixth-formers to apply to university. The survey says pupils who leave schools in England and Wales with A-levels are twice as likely as a graduate to be unemployed and unqualified school-leavers three times as likely. Despite this, the association claims that the rising graduate unemployment figures of the last few years have deterred many employable graduates from applying for jobs. Universities appeared to be taking vocational qualifications more seriously, with the proportion of BTec students continuing in higher education increasing from 29.8 per cent in 1990 to 51.7 per cent in 1992.

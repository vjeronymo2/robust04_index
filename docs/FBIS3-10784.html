Doctor Bayardo Izaba Solis, of the Nicaraguan Human Rights  Center (Cenidh), has said "this is the prelude to a process that  might result in large-scale deportations, and this would  negatively affect Nicaraguan families."    He has added the United States has granted asylum to the  Nicaraguans who so requested during the previous decade, so it  can do likewise now and help them again, and this attitude  should not only be the result of a given situation and for  political purposes.    The human rights violations expert has said many people--he  did not specify how many--have requested letters or affidavits  that state they have been subject to political persecution in  Nicaragua, and they must remain in the United States in the  interim.    Izaba has said U.S. immigration authorities must grant them  some type of special immigrant status, and this will allow the  Nicaraguan economy to recover slowly and be able to receive all  the people deported from the United States.    Doctor Violeta de Sandino, assistant director of the  Nicaraguan Human Rights Association (ANPDH), has told BARRICADA  "we have spoken in Washington and said conditions are not  favorable for these Nicaraguans to return to their country, and  their cases should be reviewed."    "We believe a large-scale deportation would worsen the  economic situation of the country and the families that receive  dollar remittances," Violeta has said.    Sandino has said the ANPDH endorses an extension of the  Nicaraguans' permanence in the United States, adding the  political asylum demands submitted to the U.S. Government should  be expedited.</p>

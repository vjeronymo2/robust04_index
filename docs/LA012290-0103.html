			<p><P> January 22, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> ANNE DENIES DIVORCE REPORTS  </P> <P> Britain's Princess Anne denied banner-headline reports today that she was  planning to divorce her estranged husband, Mark Phillips.  </P> <P> "I haven't seen a paper today," Queen Elizabeth's only daughter told  Independent Television News. "Divorce? Never been mentioned by anybody."  </P> <P> The 39-year-old Princess Royal, looking puzzled, was speaking from behind the  wheel of a farm vehicle on her country estate in western England.  </P> <P> Princess Anne and Phillips announced their separation last August, saying there  were no plans for divorce proceedings.  </P> <P> In a report headlined "Anne: I Want a Quickie Divorce," the Daily Express said  the princess was pushing to end the 15-year-old marriage despite Phillips' wish  to let the separation run on indefinitely.  </P></p>

			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Survey of Credit and Charge Cards (2): Future belongs to debit card - UK customers have become more astute about avoiding interest LESS THAN a decade ago, the credit card business was one of the most lucrative lines in UK retail banking. Today, the picture has changed completely. In 1992, the credit card operations of the larger banks are fighting to stay in the black. Some UK bankers can even be heard speculating that the credit card is in decline. The future belongs clearly to the debit card. One symptom of the decline is a fall in the number of credit cards in circulation. In 1990, there were 30m credit cards in the UK, but the figures changed sharply when Lloyds Bank introduced annual charges. Now there are around 26m credit cards, while debit cards have come from nowhere to 20m since 1987. Why have these changes happened? The recession in the UK economy is part of the explanation. Banks have been hit by shrinking volumes of business and the need to make provisions against bad debts. Customers have become more astute about avoiding interest by paying back on time. 'With no prospect of significant growth in the credit card business for the foreseeable future, everyone's attention is focused on reducing cost, and avoiding fraud and bad debt. We have started ahead of the competition and because of this we are now seeing the benefits flow through ahead of the market,' says Mr Gerald Hawkins, general manager at Lloyds Bank. One side of the card business has proved especially disappointing. In 1989, the Big Four piled eagerly in to merchant acquiring - the provision of card services to retailers - which had previously been handled by Barclaycard for Visa and Access for the MasterCard/Eurocard brands. Last year the banks lost about Pounds 75m on this business and only Lloyds claims to be making a profit. The losses have revived long-standing tensions between card issuers and retailers. Early this year the banks reversed a policy of offering retailers lower processing charges to win market share and raised their tariffs. The average charge went up from 1.6 per cent to 1.8 per cent of each transaction, provoking cries of protest. Five large food retailers (Asda, Tesco, Gateways, Sainsburys and Safeway) announced that they would hold out against the banks and establish a Joint Negotiation Committee. In the US, most banks long ago gave up trying to make money out of merchant acquiring and left the job to specialist companies. So far these have not appeared on the UK scene. Things could get still worse for the banks if some of the retailers get their way. They are beginning to press for a review of the interchange fee system, the fixed charge which the retailer's bank pays to a credit card holder's bank. Interchange fees generate much of the income banks get from their card operations and they are usually set by the international payment systems, Visa International and MasterCard, and so are not subject to negotiation between a bank and its customer. In the days when merchant service charges were well above 2 per cent, the existence of the interchange fee did not bother retailers too much. But some large retailers today have negotiated merchant service charges of 1.2 or 1.3 per cent - and most of the payment goes on the interchange fee. A shake-up of the interchange system is unlikely to come quickly. The interchange fee is an international rather than simply a British way of doing things and politicians (with the exception of Mr Nicholas Ridley when he was at the Department of Trade and Industry) have been reluctant to interfere with it. If the interchange fee system were to break down, the economics of card issuing would be revolutionised. Card holders and the smaller issuers would be the main losers. Card holders would have to pay more for the card services they receive and almost certainly the large banks would find it easy to undercut the smaller issues. Small banks are as yet undeterred. They see credit cards as a good way to broaden their customer base. Bank of Cyprus (UK), for example, is using its Visa card to find new customers. Meanwhile, debit cards continue to grow rapidly. Turnover on Switch, the electronic-only debit card launched in 1988, is now around Pounds 4bn a year with around 14m transactions being processed a month. Mr Tim Green, chief manager of Switch Card Services, forecasts that by the year 2000 there will be 8m debit card transactions a day with about 70 per cent of adults using them. 'We expect debit transaction to overtake credit transactions in 1992 and to exceed cheque volume by 1996,' says Mr Richard Reay-Smith, chief executive of Barclaycard. The expansion of the bank card market has created some serious problems about card branding, especially ways of distinguishing credit and debit cards. None of the solutions on offer so far has been very elegant. Visa has had to introduce a second branding, called Delta, for its UK debit cards so that retailers who want to take debit cards but not credit cards can do so. In practice, Delta remains something of an ugly duckling among payment card brands. Not all retailers understand it and few consumers seem to do. There is even greater confusion about brandings on the other side of the fence where until a few years ago there was just one branding, Access. Now Access seems to be fading. MasterCard products abound and staff numbers at the Access branding operation are expected to be cut by as much as half in the near future. If one of the Access banks dropped the branding, it would probably not survive. Possibly the four banks which own the Access brand will eventually sell it off. Eurocard, the European affiliate of MasterCard which is prevalent, has never caught on as a branding in the UK, since British banks prefer a global branding. On the debit card side, the pattern is less easy to predict. The Switch branding dates back only to 1988 and though it was set up by a group of Access/MasterCard banks, it has as yet no international affiliations. An eventual tie-up with Maestro, the MasterCard debit branding, and the European Debit Card scheme looks likely. Mr Ron Williams, the director of payment services at National Westminster, says he is fairly optimistic about the chances that Switch will join the EDC/Maestro group. Just how Switch will co-exist with these brands if it does so, is hard to say. Possibly Switch customers will be given the choice of paying an extra fee to be linked to EDC and Maestro. But it is equally conceivable that the branding could start to go the way of Access. Meanwhile, banks have got the green light from the Bank of England to securitise some of the credit card debt - an operation which is already familiar in North America. Each bond offer will be individually inspected by the Bank. The move will take some of the strain off the banks' card operations. Barclays, the UK's oldest and largest card issuer, looks likely to lead the way yet again.</p>

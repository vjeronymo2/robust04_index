			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 12 (KCNA) -- The dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il received a rare camellia presented by a  South Korean botanist on the occasion of his birthday.    Camellia, an evergreen noted in Korea from olden times, is a  plant which grows on mild seashores and foots of mountains and  around houses in the central and southern parts of the country.  It is also an ornamental plant.    The gift camellia with 52 growth rings is 6 centimetres in  diametre at the bottom of its stem, 60 centimetres in height and  75 centimetres between tips of spread branches.    The botanist decided to present this plant to General Kim  Chong-il, representing the desire of him and his colleagues to  live like a camellia which stands green all the year round,  letting its red flowers bloom, always revering the general.    Handing camellia to a fellow countryman, he said:    "This camellia carries the unanimous wishes not only of me  and my friends but also of the South Korean people who hold  General Kim Chong-il in high esteem.    "We ask you to courteously convey this camellia of the South  Sea coast to the general who put forward a reunification  strategy of chuche and is devoting his all to the noble cause of  reunification with matchless grit and iron will."</p>

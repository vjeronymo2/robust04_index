			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / France calls for European rapid intervention force Mr Francois Leotard, the French defence minister, yesterday suggested setting up multinational European rapid intervention forces, a project far more ambitious than the Franco-German-Belgian Eurocorps now being created, Reuter reports from Paris. Mr Leotard, in a speech to a symposium on European defence, called for a summit of the nine-member Western European Union (WEU), the designated security arm of the European Union. 'Such a meeting could allow the Europeans, for example, to create European intervention forces, commanded by a European general staff and which would be both multinational and have integrated (air, land and sea) forces,' Mr Leotard said. The Eurocorps, seen as the future land-based defence force of the WEU, will become operational later this year, with one French and one German division plus a Belgian brigade. But the Strasbourg-based Eurocorps will have no air or naval forces of its own and Mr Leotard linked his new plan to an existing one for the creation of an air and naval force made up of French, Spanish and Italian units. Mr Leotard said he was not seeking to rival Nato, of which France remains a member but whose integrated military command it left in 1966 because of US dominance.</p>

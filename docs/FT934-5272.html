			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (14): Shares: the way we were THE POST-WAR HISTORY OF THE LONDON STOCK MARKET 1945-92 by George G. Blakey Mercury Business Books Pounds 19.95 364 pages In 1947 you could have invested directly in Glaxo for the first time, when the baby food and penicillin maker became listed through the restructuring of a group called Joseph Nathan. Alternatively you could have put your money in the established giants of the time, including Swan Hunter, Morris Motors or Dunlop, all prominent constituents of the FT 30-Share Index at the time. You would have done vastly better in Glaxo, but you might never have known it at the time. George Blakey's entertaining history of the London stock market over nearly 50 years fills a gap, and appears just in time to solve some Christmas present problems for the families of mature investors. The author mostly ignores dry statistics and instead concentrates on highlighting the key events and personalities. Such battles as as the bruising scramble for British Aluminium in 1958 and the failed bid by ICI for Courtaulds in 1961 are still widely remembered in the City. The disappearance of the old yield gap between equities and gilts in August 1959 is of particular interest now as investment strategists debate the impact of the return of inflation to 1950s levels. The agony of 1974 is well described, but the crash of 1987 - the single most spectacular market event in this period - possibly rather less so. Even the company names seem to evoke a distant era: it is hard to imagine a company these days being called Daintifyt Brassieres, a 1959 bull market flotation (we have clearer memories of another 1959 listing, Polly Peck). As for the individual entrepreneurs, George Blakey adds considerable life to the book by picking out interesting characters and following them through the years. Many shooting stars burned out quickly but one or two, notably Lords Weinstock and Hanson, have been around for most of the period surveyed. This is the viewpoint of a stockbroker, so readers should not expect academic theories and elaborate explanations. But the facts will be fascinating in themselves to anyone who has lived through even a part of the period. The market has, after all, coped with amazingly contrasting periods. In the 1940s the government was busy nationalising bus companies, now it is enthusiastically privatising them.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Juergen Siebenlist: "DSD Waste Becomes </F> Chemical Raw Material Source"]    [Text]VDI-N, Cologne--The decision about utilizing used  plastic packaging from the "Yellow Sack" of Dual System Germany  (DSD) in Cologne for raw materials has been made. On 16 March  the board of directors of the DKR Company for Plastics Recycling  in Cologne authorized management to negotiate contracts with the  companies BASF/Otto, RWE and VEW/KAB for the construction and  running of recycling plants with an annual capacity of up to  500,000 tons.    The head of the BASF plastics division, member of the board  Dr. Albrecht Eckell, considered this decision to be an "approved  surcharge" for his company's raw material recycling plan. For a  consortium made up of BASF AG in Ludwigshafen and Otto Plastics  Service GmbH in Heidelberg has made DKR an offer to utilize the  materials of 300,000 tons of used polymers annually starting in  1996.    At the moment BASF is constructing a suitable pilot plant in  Ludwigshafen to transform mixed and soiled plastic waste into  reusable petrochemical raw materials. The resulting distillates  are naphtha, olefins and aromatics, which are used as on-site  materials within the investment group. According to Eckell, loss  of quality does not occur as it does in the case of working  material recycling (plastic wastes are made into plastics again).    The BASF board member sees raw material recycling as an  ecologically and economically sensible alternative for  utilization. For he says that "disproportionately many  resources" are used in the recycling of working materials for  packaging marked with the Green Dot. "Collecting, sorting and  cleaning require an unreasonably high level of energy, water and  costs," says Dr. Albrecht Eckell, "which cannot be justified  ecologically or economically."    These problems are also reflected in the new licensing  compensation structure for the "Green Dot," which was agreed on  by the DSD board of directors on 21 March. It stipulates, for  example, that from 1 October an additional DM2.95 per kg is to  be paid to Dual System for plastic containers over a base amount  defined by number and volume.    This means that the timing would be precisely right for raw  material recycling as a brake on costs. For according to Dr.  Albrecht Eckell the reduction of the total utilization costs for  plastics is a particular concern of the plastics industry. Of  the present high costs of about DM3,000 per ton for recycling in  Dual System, about 80 percent can be traced to expensive  collecting and sorting, he said. But with raw material recycling  that could largely be dispensed with. Achievable exploitation of  the material is given by the BASF plastics expert as 85 to 95  percent. Says Eckell: "This makes raw material recycling--  contrary to a common prejudice--an efficient kind of  utilization."    In addition, the goals of the packaging ordinance, which are  ambitious in the opinion of BASF--according to current  interpretation, from 1 July 1995 approximately 600,000 tons of  private commercial packaging must be collected, sorted and  materially reused by DSD--can only be met, according to Dr.  Albrecht Eckell, with the help of raw material recycling. In  this way 300,000 tons of DSD material could be recycled annually  from mid-1996.    For plastics recycling on a major technological scale BASF  needs an additional surcharge of about DM350 per ton and,  according to Eckell, "stable framework conditions." Among these  he includes permanent exemption from the requirement for plastic  packaging to be returnable in the marketplace.    Wolfram Brueck is confident that the DKR's decision marks a  great step forward in this regard also. "There is no more reason  to set a time limit on exemption for plastics through the Land  departments," says the DSD managing director.    But more than one plant is needed for comprehensive  utilization of the used plastic packaging created in Germany. In  the view of BASF board member Eckell, only through the  construction of additional utilization facilities by other  companies can the goal of keeping dumps free of plastics be  reached. As an example he cited Veba Oel AG, which hopes to  transform 120,000 tons of used plastics annually into a  synthetic oil in the coal/oil plant in Bottrop starting in 1996.  He also listed RWE's plan to use 70,000 tons of used plastics  annually in the production of synthesis gas.</p>

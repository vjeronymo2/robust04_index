			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, April 21 (BTA) -- The Bulgarian-Dutch  relations and the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina were high on the  agenda of the talks between Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev  and Netherlands' Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers now on a formal  visit to this country accompanied by Foreign Minister Pieter  Kooijmans.    President Zhelev during the talks stressed that the  integration into the European structures is this country's  foreign policy priority, the president's spokesman said after  the meeting. Dr. Zhelev raised the issue of the ratification of  the agreement for Bulgaria's association with the European  Union. Commenting on this matter, Mr. Lubbers pledged that the  Dutch parliament will ratify the document this summer. The  guest also told the Bulgarian president that a group of  businessmen from the Netherlands will visit this country to  investigate the conditions Bulgaria has to offer to foreign  investors and the possibilities for setting up joint ventures.    President Zhelev further briefed Mr. Lubbers on this  country's stance on the Yugo-conflict and commented on its views  against the sending of Turkish blue helmets to join the UN  peacekeeping troops in Bosnia. He said that this country  believes an involvement of a country neighbouring to former  Yugoslavia is likely to escalate the conflict and impede the  peace process.    The Dutch delegation today met National Assembly Chairman  Aleksandur Yordanov and the Parliamentary Committees on National  Security and Foreign Policy. The talks again focused on the  situation in the Balkans and the developments in  Bosnia-Hercegovina.    Speaking at a news conference later today, Prime Minister  Lubbers said he was convinced that the two countries have  opportunities to further promote their business cooperation. He  also said he was aware of the obstacles arising from the  painstaking transition to a market economy this country is  currently going through. According to him, this is where the  Netherlands can offer its help within the framework of the  Council of Europe and the Partnership for Peace initiative. Mr.  Lubbers identified positive trends in the development of the  political contacts between the two countries and went on to say  that the Bulgarian defence minister will soon pay a visit to the  Netherlands.    Answering a journalist's question, Mr. Lubbers said the  Netherlands would not oppose the idea of calling a conference on  the Yugo-conflict on the territory of a neutral neighbouring  country as long as this does not waste more time further  postpone the end of the war.    This afternoon the delegation left Bulgaria.</p>

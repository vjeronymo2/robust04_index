			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / Rock solid against Yeltsin's reforms: John Lloyd examines the battle for political power that is stifling Russia's economic development The vice-president of Russia, a long-time opponent of the president with whom he was elected a little over two years ago, is suspended from his duties by the president because he is charged with corruption on a massive scale. His allies in parliament declare the suspension invalid and refer it to the constitutional court. Though the president's men protest that this is merely a head of state protecting Russia's reputation against allegations of wrongdoing in high places, the move is widely seen as the opening of the 'September offensive' Mr Boris Yeltsin promised against his many foes. The offensive is aimed at breaking the Gordian knot of political tensions and enmities now so large and tight that a chainsaw, not a sword, is required. Russians and western observers are both tired of Mr Yeltsin's promised 'decisive' movements against his opponents. He has so far lacked the will to smash through the existing constitution to clear the space for a new one: if this is the long-promised offensive, say Moscow political circles, so be it, but no smart money is on it. No wonder he hesitates: the Russian president has a queue of immense problems that awaits his attention. Tackling any one of them in a decisive way would shatter the unstable stasis that is Russian politics at present. He has, in the first place, an incoherent and internally warring government: not only are the extremes within it accusing each other of corruption, but so are nominal allies - Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, first deputy prime minister suspended from office at the same time as Vice-President Alexander Rutskoi, had earlier accused Mr Sergei Glaziev, the trade minister and a moderate reformist, of corrupt practices. Further, it is riven on economic policy: Mr Oleg Lobov, another first deputy premier appointed by Mr Yeltsin from the ranks of his old friends, is pushing hard for the doubling of state investments, even as Mr Boris Fyodorov, the finance minister, struggles to contain the budget deficit within a limit of 10 per cent of gross national product. The government's grip on the country's regions and republics is weak: the shaping of transparent, equally applied laws and taxes is rendered impossible because those at the top levels of power in Moscow are competing for allies in the regions and cities with promises and deals. Private business, in some areas, booms - but often it is the boom of machine guns, as contract killers remove rivals or non-payers of protection money. Around 10 bankers have been murdered in the past few months, together with a handful of foreign businessmen. These assassinations put an effective wall around the private sector, advertising it as a place only for the greedy, the corrupt and the well guarded. To be sure, the profit motive appears to be ingrained: and on the evidence of former prime minister Mr Yegor Gaidar's Association of Private and Privatising Businesses, which held a conference last week, many state managers are becoming interested in profit, stable prices and investment. To be sure, too, businesses are being created and some infrastructure investments are being made in some locations, such as St Petersburg, Ekaterinburg, Rostov. But the all-consuming struggle for power, like a great wen, drains energy and resources from all over the country. The government survives, in part, by placating the political and economic actors. Mr Vladimir Mau, a former government adviser, mentions the example of Ulyanovsk region receiving a special dispensation to keep 50 per cent of the value-added tax it collects, rather than the stipulated 20 per cent. Word is spreading among other regional leaders, and they are lobbying for the same treatment. Parliament is discussing a law to give the regions discretionary powers on what taxes to remit to the centre - precisely the issue seized on by the putschists in August 1991 as a reason for their attempt to stop the disintegration of the then Soviet Union. A weak, split government cannot hope to fulfil the conditions laid down by the Group of Seven leading industrial nations, and administered by the International Monetary Fund, for the payment of assistance. At the end of August, Mr John Odling-Smee, the IMF's chief interlocutor with the Russian government, told it that unless progress was made on curbing the budget deficit, lowering inflation (now said, by Mr Shumeiko, to be heading for 30 per cent a month once more) and delivering on a reasonable reform programme, the second half of the Dollars 3bn special fund would not be paid this autumn. This quiet indication is an admission of failure by both Russia and the G7. It was only in the spring that a new headline figure, of Dollars 44bn, was unveiled as the western package to save Russia. In July the figure was confirmed by the G7 leaders in Tokyo. Now, say western diplomats and international economists, the G7 is studying the figures - especially the amount of western funds ending up in Swiss bank accounts - and toning down the rhetoric. The political consequences of this tacit suspension of support for the reform strategy threatens the further existence of the tiny band of radical reformers within the cabinet itself. This may mean that the G7 - most of whose members were sceptical about the US-led Dollars 44bn package in any case - has given up its faith that rapid reform is possible. Diplomatic conversations refer increasingly to the lack of a real consensus for change, and are replete with comparisons with those Latin American countries, such as Mexico and Argentina, which managed to produce solid bases for radical action only after a sufficiently large section of the political class had become convinced there was no alternative, and had in turn produced a government committed to such a policy. In Russia, the initial Gaidar-led team, whose members were hot-eyed for reform, has been whittled down to a few weary individuals doggedly fighting for what they can win and ceding what they cannot. All of the economic indicators, save the stability of the rouble, which has remained at just under 1,000 to the dollar for nearly two months, are turning against them. General Winter, that scourge of attacks from the west, again approaches. Mr Yeltsin, the inheritor of all the centralist, authoritarian instincts of Russian political and civil societies, remains the key to action. He has a strategy of sorts: to share state power not with the parliament but with a Federation Council composed of regional and republican leaders who will support his plans for new parliamentary elections and a new constitution. It cannot be arrived at constitutionally and it lacks many of the attributes of formal (and informal) democracy. But it may be an effective, if blunt, instrument for breaking through to conditions within which democracy could be constructed. He has also, over this past weekend, bolstered his position with that substantial part of the political class, which sees him as too complaisant and weak, by appearing to force Ukraine's leadership to sell its half of the divided Black Sea fleet and send back the nuclear warheads on Ukrainian territory to Russia. This takes the wind out of the sails of the nationalist opposition, and increases the chances that at least the three Slav states of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus - with most of the central Asian countries and possibly others among the former Soviet republics - will agree later this month to huddle together under Russian economic, security and political hegemony. This partial reconstitution of the union would increase Mr Yeltsin's standing - though it would further add to Russia's enormous economic burdens. But even if this were to be achieved, the Russian president must still surmount major problems of decisiveness, stamina and belief. He must muster large amounts of the first two to take on a well-entrenched, many-tentacled opposition in the middle of a prolonged slump, and push a programme that means further sacrifices. For that, he must believe in the ultimate rightness of a radical programme. But what Mr Yeltsin believes is a real puzzle: time and again, he makes decisions based on what appears to be a genuinely liberal world view; time and again, his actions, either of commission or omission, contradict such a view. Thus, when once more he faces a decisive choice, we cannot know how - or if - he will finally make it.</p>

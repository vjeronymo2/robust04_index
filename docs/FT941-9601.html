			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Observer: Old sloths So much for the notion that we live in an era of 'new man' who gladly washes the dishes, does the vacuuming and changes baby's nappy. Now we are about to be told, by Mintel's market researchers, that more than 50 per cent of British males admit to being 'sloths'. Only 4 per cent of UK men 'always' do the washing; on the other hand 41 per cent take care to polish the car. Typical.</p>

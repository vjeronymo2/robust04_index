			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brussels strives to keep farm reform plans on track THE EUROPEAN Commission was last night trying to keep its plans to overhaul the Common Agricultural Policy on track in the face of attempts by several member states to postpone decisions until the outcome of the Uruguay Round world trade negotiations is known. As feared, the impasse over farm subsidies within the General Agreement on Tarifs and Trade negotiations is calling into question the European Community's internal farm reform process, which the commission had managed to push towards near consensus by the end of last year. EC farm ministers broke off their meeting here last night to enter lengthy bilateral negotiations with the Portuguese presidency of the EC and the commission. These were expected to try to resolve by today the 'chicken and egg' question of whether enough member states feel able to decide levels of reduction in CAP support before the level of subsidy cuts within Gatt is agreed. The council meeting openned with six of the 12 - Denmark, the Netherlands, the UK, Ireland, France and Italy - saying the Uruguay Round outcome must be known first. Mr John Gummer, UK farm minister, first in to the bilateral 'confessionals' with the presidency and commission, said 'we must wait for a Gatt deal and find out what it is, and then work for a CAP deal'. The CAP reform proposed by the commission envisages sharp cuts, centred on a 35 per cent reduction in cereals support prices over three years, refunded to farmers on the basis of average yields in the 1989-91 reference period, thereby getting rid of the incentive to produce more grains, the main product in the farm subsidies dispute within Gatt. Larger farmers would have to take land out of production to get the compensation. The agriculture chapter in the draft conclusions of the Uruguay Round, requires a 36 per cent cut in export subsidies, a 24 per cent cut in the volume of subsidised exports, and a 20 per cent drop in domestic support, all over six years. Though seemingly compatible, the Gatt formula would not allow the EC's direct compensation payments in to the 'green box' for 'neutral' subsidies, even though they are tailored to restrain production, which would feed through into less subsidised exports which distort trade. The commission insists it needs some recognition of this quasi-decoupled compensation if it is to make the cuts. It also fears that some member states now see the opportunity to play off the two negotiating processes, thereby winning back the ground they had ceded in the CAP talks throughout last year. Mr Ray MacSharry, the EC agriculture commissioner, can - his officials say - threaten to introduce cuts without any compensation at all as part of this year's price package, in an effort to cajole ministers and the big farm lobbies into line.</p>

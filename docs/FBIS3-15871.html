"PRES leader Sergey Shakhray had received an invitation, but  since he is now away on a business trip, other PRES  representatives were not invited, Sergey Stankevich told the  newspaper's correspondent.    "Mr. Stankevich said the meeting had been organised in  principle to reconcile the ultra wings of the political  spectrum, although it is difficult to agree that the communists,  agrarians and sectoral trade unions, on the one hand, and  Russia's Choice and independent trade unions, on the other, can  be viewed as such.    "Grigoriy Yavlinsky was not invited, maybe, because he does  not represent any of the ultra forces. Mr. Yavlinsky treated  this calmly, remarking that it was somehow strange to summon  people to reach some accord on the next day after the  president's meeting with the U.S. ex-president was cancelled  because the latter permitted himself to meet with opposition  figures".    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries an article by Aleksey Vasilyev,  director of the Institute of African Studies of the Russian  Academy of Sciences, who believes that "Islamic Fundamentalism"  does not pose real danger to Russia. There are other dangers,  though, namely, that of extremism if the crisis, both the  socio-economic and inter-ethnic one, continues to intensify, the  danger of a rise in the threshold of non-receptivity of  information and of the loss of ability for a dialogue."    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA runs an interview with President  Suleyman  Demirel of Turkey. He said in particualr as follows: "In  Russia, there are many people discontented with the break-up of  the Soviet Union, dissatisfied with the fact that the republics  of Central Asia, the Transcaucasus and eastern European  countries are no longer within Russia's sphere of influence.    "They believe that a new Russia should be created within the  borders of the former Soviet Union. It is only natural that  this is the subject of concern for many countries, not only  Turkey. If Russia is going to become an imperialist state, it  would shake others' confidence in itself.    "If this happens, that would be undoubtedly a blow to many  countries which would view Russia as a threat... If we maintain  peace and cooperation, that would be of benefit to both Russia  and other countries".    ROSSIISKIE VESTI on food quality in Russia:    "Over the past three years, the food quality situation has  become particularly exacerbated. In Russia as a whole,  bacteriological inspections revealed that from 12 to 15 per cent  of dairy products, fish and fish products, and from 7 to 10 per  cent of meat products did not meet standard requirements.    "In some regions, the percentage is twice as high. Even with  such an acute situation, legislative and legal standards fail to  promote food safety. A number of essential laws have not been  adopted up to now and some standards have not been even drawn  up".    ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI on the radioactive contamination issue:    "Last year, about 237,000 people, who live in the areas of  radioactive contamination (as a result of the breakdown at the  Chernobyl nuclear power station -- note by ITAR-TASS) were  examined. Fifty-eight per cent of adults and 72 per cent of  children from among those examined turned out to be seriously  ill".    ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI on the cost of services:    "Since the beginning of the year, the cost of every-day  services for the population of Russia has almost doubled.  Housing rent rose by 84 per cent, hot water supply by 58 per  cent, the cost of some types of medical services by 18-28 per  cent and consumer services by 12-26 per cent".    TRUD carries an interview with Sergey Samoilov, deputy chief  of the Territorial Development Department of the administration  of the Russian president.    Samoilov stated: "One is put on one's guard by a high  activity of opposition political forces that seek at all costs  to take a dominant position in power bodies, using the election  campaign (in the regions -- note by ITAR-TASS) to discredit the  presidential policy of reforms.    "Most regions have a rather tense socio-political situation,  which is sure to tell on voters' turnout, questioning the  possibility of holding elections in a number of regions within  the time-limit stipulated by decrees, or will affect the quality  of the elections. This applies to areas in the far north and  Magadan region".    ST. PETERSBURG GAZETTE reports that the German Lufthansa air  company broadens the sphere of its influence in the Russian air  transportation sector.    Lufthansa now runs flights from St Petersburg to Hamburg and  Frankfurt-am-Main, and will soon introduce regular flights from  Pulkovo to Munich every Saturday. The cheapest round-trip  ticket costs 565 U.S. dollars.</p>

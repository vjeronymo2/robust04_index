			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Yi Ki-yun from Tokyo] </F>   [Text] A delegation of Japan Socialist Party [JSP]  lawmakers of the Japanese coalition ruling party, which is  visiting China, is seeking a way to visit Pyongyang by  contacting a North Korean diplomatic office in Beijing. SANKEI  SHIMBUN reported this today.    According to SANKEI SHIMBUN, JSP Vice President Inoue and  other members of the party delegation held a secret meeting with  North Korean Minister Pae Yong-chae in Beijing on 4 April and  expressed their desire to visit Pyongyang to create an  atmosphere for resolving the North Korean nuclear issue. North  Korea avoided giving an immediate response to this and only  repeated its earlier attitude of denouncing the United States  and the adoption of a statement of the UN Security Council's  president.</p>

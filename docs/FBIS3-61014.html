			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Colonel S. Valchenko under the rubric "For High </F> Combat Readiness": "Resurrection--The Tu-160 is Part of  the Russian Air Forces!"]    [Text] The crew of a Tu-160 supersonic missile  aircraft launched a long-range cruise missile for the first time  in the Russian Air Forces on 22 Oct 92.    The crew was headed on this flight by Lieutenant-Colonel A.  Zhikharev. The co-pilot was Lieutenant-Colonel N. Moiseyenko,  and the navigators were Lieutenant-Colonel A. Gavrilov (aerial  navigation, weaponry) and Lieutenant-Colonel A. Pakulev (EW,  communications). They are all top-rated specialists and masters  of their trade. The commander has 400 hours of flying time, out  of a total of 1,600, on the Tu-160. The operations of the air  strike system on the route were monitored by the crews of a  flying laboratory--an airborne command and telemetry station  (KIP).    The Tu-160 went up from the base airfield at precisely the  appointed time. Lieutenant-Colonel A. Zhikharev brought the  aircraft out to the permitted launch zone. Having received the  confirmation to release the cruise missile, the crew executed  the launch and took a heading for the airfield.    The KIP aircraft tracked the missile, recording the  parameters of its autonomous flight. The KIP transmitted that  the target had been hit after the Tu-160 had landed!    The first to congratulate the fliers on their success was  Long-Range Aviation [DA] Chief Navigator Major-General V.  Yegorov. Here is what he had to say about the event: "Russia  needs not only means of defense that inspire respect, but also  means of effective deterrence. They include the greatest  achievement of domestic aviation thought--the Tu-160 aircraft  system. The significance of a practical launch of a long-range  cruise missile, made from the Tu-160 aircraft for the first time  in the Russian Air Forces, is difficult to overestimate. The  results of the intensive work to assimilate this most modern  aircraft system have come to their result."    A day later Lieutenant-Colonel A. Malyshev and Major V.  Adamov brought back an excellent grade from a flight for weapons  delivery. Lieutenant-Colonels Zhikharev and Gavrilov were  instructors this time.    The practical launches of low-altitude, long-range cruise  missiles from the Tu-160, as was justly noted by the chief  navigator of DA, crowned the intensive labor of the flight  personnel and ground specialists. The course of combat training  of the strategic flight crews was under the steadfast attention  of the commander-in-chief of the Russian Air Forces for several  months. They awaited information from each flight shift that  took place here as paramount at the headquarters of long-range  aviation. And here is why. It was namely at this airfield that  the question was being resolved of whether the aviators of the  Russian Air Forces would be able to master the most powerful  modern-day aircraft system in the world--the Tu-160--in a short  period of time.    The Tu-160 fourth-generation aircraft is a heavy,  multimode and multipurpose missile-carrying bomber with a  variable-geometry wing. It embodies the merits of the best  domestic heavy aircraft. Modern aerodynamics, a high  thrust-to-weight ratio and the ability to carry various types of  weaponry have made it a weighty element in the aviation  component of the domestic nuclear triad. The aggregate striking  power of a single Tu-160 is commensurate with the striking power  of two Tu-95MS aircraft or two squadrons of Tu-22M3 aircraft. A  strike group of three or four such aircraft is able to make any  aggressor nation listen to reason.    The list of measures and quantity of manpower and equipment  to prepare the Tu-160 for a weapons-delivery sortie could be  compared to the launch of a spacecraft. Imagine for a moment  that the specialists at Plesetsk or Baykonur were to leave their  prepared launch sites, select a new and unprepared location and  launch a spacecraft from it in a month or two. Impossible? Well,  the Russian aviators that had to master the Tu-160 were in  roughly that same situation. And they came through with honor.    But how did that become possible all the same? Why did the  Russian fliers have to master a most complex aircraft system in  a crash course?    The first Tu-160 aircraft, which were an answer to the  American B-1, began coming to the Air Forces for experimental  operation as early as in 1987. The training of flight personnel  for their planned assimilation began at the same time. By  January of 1992 there was a fully combat-ready unit of these  aircraft at Priluki in Ukraine. This was the Guards  Poltava-Berlin Order of Lenin, Red Banner Air Regiment, which  was the foundation of the striking power of Soviet strategic  aviation. A breach soon appeared, however, in our overall  "defensive shield." All of the latest aircraft were unilaterally  declared to be the property of Ukraine. The personnel were  "democratically" offered the chance to take the oath and remain  at Priluki or to return to the Russian Air Forces. Many chose  Russia.    What did Ukraine get as the result of this division?  Nothing.  Because all of the "privatized" Tu-160 aircraft were laid up  immediately. There were none of the special fuels or spare  parts. All of the plants that supplied constituent items  remained outside of "independent country." No one ended up the  winner from the resultant situation. Assertions were then heard  in some places that Russia had been deprived of the Tu-160s, and  would not soon be able to make up the loss.    The Russian aviators to whom it fell to prove the reverse  had  to overcome many difficulties. All of the ground-preparation  physical plant of the bomber regiment--the simulators, missile  preparation positions, specially equipped facilities--had been  left at Priluki. There were not enough specialists. The  technical crews were brought up to strength using personnel from  the local regiment. It was not enough to retrain those  people--their professional psychology had to be altered. Almost  all of them, after all, had been servicing tanker aircraft, and  could not conceive of the specific nature of service in a  regiment of long-range bombers.    The flight personnel had their own concerns. When new  aircraft were delivered from the plant, when the system of  ground support was deployed and the engineering and technical  personnel were trained on them, an intolerable interruption in  flying occurred among the pilots and navigators. They had to  resurrect their skills. And that was all once again in a brief  period of time.    But all of these are military difficulties. But add to them  the social and domestic ones as well. The families of many of  the fliers had remained in Ukraine, and they still have to  travel there on leave. The apartments in the new garrison are  still, as they say, only "a gleam." That is how they live. And  all of that for the sake of resurrecting strategic aviation. For  the sake of Russia.    The intensive process of assimilating the strategic  supersonic missile aircraft is behind them today. The answer has  been given--the Tu-160 is part of the Russian Air Forces!    And now we give the floor to those who were involved in this  event, a truly historic one for the Russian Air Forces.    Lieutenant-Colonel V. Karpov, inspector-navigator of  long-range aviation: "I was at that airfield along with  senior inspector-pilot Lieutenant-Colonel A. Medvedev for three  months. Everything took place before our eyes. First we made  check flights in the new aircraft. Then we flew as instructors  to "resurrect" the command personnel of the regiment. We studied  special techniques on the ground with the pilots and navigators.  The program to prepare for the practical launches was fulfilled  entirely as a result. The flight personnel tried very hard,  since the Tu-160 is the favorite aircraft of all. The piloting  and navigational system has no analogue in our aviation. No  aircraft can compare in thrust-to-weight ratio or aerodynamic  properties. It was also highly regarded in the West. Our hero  was named the Blackjack there--you won't encounter one better,  they say.    "It is noteworthy that this powerful craft is in the sure  hands of Russian fliers."    Lieutenant-Colonel S. Toporkov, senior engineer of the  formation for missile weaponry: "I came here along with  those who did not stay at Priluki. We had to get used to an  airfield all over again, one that was not adapted for the  operation of the Tu-160. Every technical crew at Priluki, by the  way, had a shed on the hardstand. Here it was just an open  field. All of that had to be built. There were not enough  facilities to service the aircraft, or individual protective  gear--respirators, special gloves, footgear. But people must be  given their due: they tried without sparing themselves. Major A.  Smyzhin made the first flight of the Tu-160 at this airfield.  This was, so to speak, his second debut. He had been the first  at Priluki. I would also like to note among the technical crews  Captain G. Farkhutdinov, senior lieutenants V. Sapsay, K.  Korepanov, N. Ivnitskiy, S. Stepanchenko and lieutenants A.  Nikolayev, A. Ibrayev and O. Solyanik. They are by and large  young fellows, but skilled and diligent."    V. Ryazanov, supervisor of the scientific crew of the  airborne command and telemetry station: "The KIP aircraft  is a scientific subunit of the Flight Test Institute imeni M.M.  Gromov. We were brought in as part of the scientific support for  the practical launches of the cruise missiles. The special gear  installed on the Il-76 aircraft makes possible the comprehensive  analysis of the operations of the strike system and the  monitoring of the independent flight of the cruise missile for  all the principal parameters. The KIP can issue a command to  self-destruct the missile in the event it strays off course. But  we did not have to issue that command during the practical  launches from the Tu-160. The missiles followed their routings  precisely, and hit the training targets. I would like to make  note of the work of our specialists--test pilot G. Stadnik,  navigator A. Kurmangleyev and lead engineers for flight testing  N. Yefremov, F. Khaziyev, V. Ozeritskiy and V. Usik..."    In place of an afterword: One of the many  newspaper features on the Tu-160 reported that "Series output  could be curtailed." "If that happens," wrote the journalist,  "then the priceless experience gained in the process of creating  the heavy bomber would be lost, and a breach that will be  difficult to close will appear in the aerial strategic shield of  our Homeland..."    What can be added to that? It only remains to share  this anxiety. Would a decision that would lead to unilateral  disarmament, to the loss of defensive scientific and technical  potential, really be sensible? It would set us back 10--15 years  in a technological regard. The answer would seem to be obvious.  Russia needs strong wings--such as those of the Tu-160  aircraft.

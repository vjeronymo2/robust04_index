			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / People: Highland fling for former Premier Brands man The Scottish Tourist Board has appointed Derek Reid, right, once a prominent figure in the UK food industry, to become its new chief executive. He takes over in mid-January when Tom Band, who came from a civil service background, retires. Reid, 49, an Aberdonian by birth, spent his early career with Cadbury-Schweppes, becoming managing director of Cadbury-Typhoo and then managing director of the group's foods and tea business. In 1986 he was founding member of Premier Brands, which bought out Cadbury-Typhoo. In 1989 Premier Brands was sold to Hillsdown Holdings but Reid stayed on until 1990 to smoothe the transition. He then returned to Scotland, becoming a director of A I Welders in Inverness, a buyout from the engineers Verson International. He also bought Farleyer House, an upmarket Perthshire hotel. His return to full-time executive life - 'I feel pretty young and energetic'  -comes at a crucial time for the STB. Not only has Scottish tourism been flagging in the recession, but the STB is to be completely restructured. It will lose to the local enterprise companies its role of giving financial aid to tourism development and will concentrate on marketing. It will also, on government orders, re-locate a large part of its operations from Edinburgh to Inverness, something which a good number of seasoned tourist industry people think a rather bizarre idea. Reid is not the first person from a private sector background to supervise the STB, but he is the only one with recent experience of running a Highland hotel - and a good number of such hotels have recently ended in receivership. Reid's answer to the problem, which applies to Scottish tourism in general, is to be much more innovative. He started a bistro in the hotel and opened his doors to children. Farleyer House, from which he will resign as a director, should make a small profit next year.</p>

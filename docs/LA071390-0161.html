			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUSH FRIEND, EX-LAWMAKER ADVISES NEIL  </P> <P> Former Rep. Thomas Ashley (D-Ohio), a longtime friend of President Bush,  confirmed today that he's been giving advice to Neil Bush since last winter on  the controversy surrounding the President's son's role in the collapse of a  Denver savings and loan.  </P> <P> But Ashley, a banking lobbyist, denied that the President had asked him to  contact his son.  </P> <P> "That is absolutely inaccurate," Ashley said in an interview. "I'm too smart to  do that."  </P> <P> The Denver Post reported in today's editions that Ashley, a college classmate  of George Bush from Yale, had talked to the younger Bush at the President's  behest before Neil Bush was questioned by federal banking regulators.  </P> <P> The newspaper attributed the report to comments by Neil Bush himself, contained  in a deposition taken by the Office of Thrift Supervision.  </P> <P> "If Neil thinks his father called me, he's mistaken," Ashley said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> TYSON'S EX-MANAGER SCORES KNOCKOUT, OF HIMSELF, WITH LETTER  </P> <P> In boxing, some guys just don't know when to quit.  </P> <P> For a change, however, we're not talking about a fighter. This one who refuses  to hang 'em up is a manager, and a well-heeled one at that.  </P> <P> Last week, Bill Cayton sent a letter to his wayward heavyweight, Mike Tyson. It  was not a love letter. As has been well-documented, Cayton and Tyson have been  estranged for most of the past two years, for various reasons, if you believe  Tyson. Or, if you believe Cayton, for one reason -- Don King.  </P> <P> Cayton, seeing an opening to perhaps move back into an active role in Tyson's  career now that he has lost his title to Buster Douglas, fired off the letter,  dated April 4, 1990, and had copies of it sent "everywhere Mike Tyson could  possibly be."  </P> <P> Including King's office?  </P> <P> "Of course I did not send it to Don King's office," Cayton said.  </P> <P> Before we get into the specifics of the letter, a copy of which was obtained by  Newsday, it bears repeating that as a manager, Cayton has yet to be proven  guilty of anything except exceptional -- some would say excessive --  competence. When Tyson-King sued Cayton last year to break the managerial  contract alleging thievery, Cayton produced documents accounting for every  penny taken in and paid out in every one of Tyson's bouts up to the Spinks  bout. Tyson and King said, don't let that fool you, we have proof that Cayton  is a thief. They have yet to produce one scrap of it.  </P> <P> But as a human being, Tyson has said Cayton is lacking something. He is not a  warm fellow, despite his somewhat awkward attempts to be one. When Tyson was  beset with personal problems, Bill Cayton was not the man the then-21-year-old  felt he could turn to for emotional support. King, of course, was only too  willing to provide same, even if his sincerity was no more genuine than  Cayton's.  </P> <P> Which brings us to The Letter. It was intended to patch things up. But it is,  perhaps, one of the finest examples ever written of "How to Further Alienate  Someone Who Already Thinks You're a Jerk."  </P> <P> Here is the opening line: "Dear Mike: What does it take to wake you up?"  </P> <P> It is tough to imagine Mike Tyson getting past that. He probably tore the paper  into confetti at that point and sprinkled it around the room, or the car, or  the nightclub, or wherever he happened to be. Nothing like being called a  nitwit right off the bat.  </P> <P> If, somehow, Tyson delved any further into this correspondence, he would have  read the following:  </P> <P> * That he was back-stabbed by King, who has cost Tyson more than $50 million  between the loss of the title and subsequent endorsements and TV commercials;  </P> <P> * That King is trying to rush him back into the ring without the proper medical  examinations, and that his only interest in a Douglas-Tyson rematch is to  cement a relationship with Douglas;  </P> <P> * That Cayton would prefer Tyson to fight Alex Stewart in June, Renaldo Snipes  in September and "a particularly appropriate opponent" in November or December,  before meeting the winner of the proposed September Douglas-Evander Holyfield  fight in early 1991.  </P> <P> All well and good, sound business advice from a consummate businessman. But  then, in the final two paragraphs, Cayton the cold fish, the snobbish autocrat,  rears his head again.  </P> <P> "As far as you and I are concerned, I want you to know that I do not want nor  expect any apology," Cayton writes. "Remember through all your comments about  me, I never said one bad word about you. I am your manager. . . . "  </P> <P> Cayton goes on to say that a reconciliation "would mean that you would have  Kevin (Rooney), Steve (Lott) and Matt Baransky working with you. The team that  brought you from your amateur days. . . ."  </P> <P> A call was put in to the Catskill, N.Y., house that Tyson grew up in, and to  which he has returned since the Douglas loss. Remember that Tyson has not  spoken to Newsday, or any other paper -- with one glaring exception -- on a  regular basis since King took over. This time was no exception. Tyson's friend  and corner man, Jay Bright, relayed some quotes he said Tyson had dictated to  him over a car phone.  </P> <P> The full text of Tyson's reply, according to Bright: "The letter speaks for  itself. The content and intent is degrading and insulting, as if I would run  back, tail between legs, because of what happened. Bill has neither the mind  nor the imagination to deceive me into that slave-master mentality. He's  pompously dangling what he perceives as bait. Let him direct that pimping  mentality somewhere else, to someone more gullible who finds it a little less  offensive."  </P> <P> Cayton, awaiting a personal reply from Tyson, reacted with shock when told of  Tyson's response to the letter. "Can you believe that?" he said. "This guy has  been so poisoned by Don King that he reacts that way to a letter in which I was  very positive? I can't believe it."  </P> <P> When it was pointed out to Cayton that perhaps the greeting was a tad strong,  and perhaps he should not have adopted a dictatorial style in his close, Cayton  seemed surprised. "Do you think it was strong? It might have been, I guess. But  I can't get to him except by using strong language. I thought I needed a strong  opening to get his attention.  </P> <P> "There would never have been a Mike Tyson if not for Jim Jacobs and Bill  Cayton. . . . He would never have been anything without me. We took him out of  a prison. . . . He has said some terrible things about me, and I have never  responded. . . . I treated him better than any fighter in the history of  boxing. . . .  </P> <P> "What does it take to reach him?"  </P> <P> Obviously, Bill, you will never know.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Ruben Blades, presidential candidate of </F> the Papa Egoro Movement, with unidentified reporters at the  Seaside View restaurant in Panama City -- live]    [Excerpt] [Blades] I thank everyone for their presence  here. I think the best way to handle this conference is by my  answering questions.    [Reporter] Your opinion of the Electoral Tribunal's first  results?    [Blades] Although the Electoral Tribunal's results, which  place us in third, are preliminary, we have no reason to doubt  the figures.    [Reporter] How do you correlate this report with the opinion  poll results released a few days ago?    [Blades] We have always said that we had a job to do  regardless of the results of the polls. Let us wait until the  final results are released.    [Reporter] Do you still have the faith you had spoken about?    [Blades] I will tell you something. We have been ranked  third. But in relation to whom? Two groups with tremendous  general experience. They are people with great resources and  experience in and from government offices. I think Papa Egoro  Movement [MPE] did an excellent job, regardless of the final  results. [applause] Had I been advised, before the beginning of  the campaign, that the movement would occupy third place as part  of the defense of a different option, I would have participated  all the same. [applause]    I will not accept any results until the final figures are  given. If Dr. Perez Balladares wins, rest assured that the MPE  will endorse this decision of the Panamanian people and that we  will hand over to him our whole program and our position.  Because this is not an issue among parties, but one that  involves the whole country. We never took an antagonistic  position. Some people ask me whether we will become opposition.  I have answered that we would constitute a group of proposals,  something we have always been. We will not change this  position. Nor will we reject the results of the people's will.    [Reporter] In other words, the party will keep going.    [Blades] We will keep going with all of the Panamanian  people. [applause] We will not shift our position. We started  this political work because we have always believed there must  be a different alternative. In the national political system,  we have found plenty of selfishness and division. Regardless of  the future political panorama, the country can rest assured that  everything we said we said from the heart and will do. Papa  Egoro will not vanish. Many parties, created just to have  access to the distribution of power, will disappear. We did not  create our political party with this purpose in mind. We will  keep working, we will not vanish. I wish to take this  opportunity to congratulate all of the MPE members who have  worked to create this movement for more than three years. There  are many heroes, men and women. There was a time when it  appeared impossible to have an alternative outside of the  parameters used by traditional parties. Party members did  everything possible to contribute their faith and hope to this  movement. Rest assured that this quota of hope and faith will  flourish and grow. No one is defecting. The party is not for  rent or for sale. The party will not quit. [applause] I also  wish to tell everyone that I am very proud of belonging to the  movement.    I believe that the work we have done has set new parameters  in national politics. This is the first time that a political  party has been formed without having been founded on ideological  or economic terms or without pressure from certain national  [?groups] or sectors. This is the first time that this has  occurred. I think we have altered all the parameters of  national political conduct.    On the personal level, I am very happy that I participated  on  behalf of a party that always presented its position in decent  terms. We never attacked anyone; we never insulted anyone, even  though there were campaigns against me, my wife, and my family.  We never stepped back from the threshold of decency and did not  fall prey to the temptation of returning insult for insult. We  are not going to do this now either.    The person who obtains the majority of votes, and in this  case it might be the PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party] and  Dr. Perez Balladares, can be completely certain that the MPE  will accept this popular dictate. As I said earlier, we are  going to present our programs to improve any proposal they might  have. I would like to say in passing that our proposals were  the best. [unidentified voice says: Right on!; followed by  cheers and applause] We are going to present our plans to  improve theirs. They can be completely certain that we are not  going to become an obstacle out of selfishness or pettiness. I  would like the other political parties in Panama to not react in  the traditional manner, and to refrain from attempting to block  initiatives that are going to benefit the country.    [Reporter] You have said that you are going to wait for the  last vote to be counted to recognize....    [Blades, interrupting] Not necessarily the last vote.    [Reporter] Do you think you could surpass that figure?    [Blades] Let me tell you something: there are still many  votes to be counted. I am not saying that we are going to wait  in order to offer our support. We already are supporting the  winner. I simply believe that we should wait for all the  figures out of respect for the Electoral Tribunal [TE], and  because this is the right thing to do before conceding, so to  speak. However, I am already taking a step forward, and am  saying we are going to support whoever wins and will not place  obstacles before his government. We ask the same from the other  political parties. We are not like the other political parties,  and that is why we are asking them to do this. We are asking  the traditional political parties to please refrain from trying  to hinder the work of whoever wins. The work of that government  will be done for the good of the country.    For basic reasons, not because we are in third or fourth  place, we are going to wait for the TE to make its announcement,  and we will accept their decision. Right now, as far as figures  are concerned, everything indicates that Dr. Perez Balladares  has won the elections. I congratulate him, the PRD, and the  country because the electoral process was carried out honestly.  Everyone came out and voted. We supported that and support the  actions of the Panamanian Government, which represents Panama,  not a party.    [Reporter] Mr. Blades, for some time the MPE held second  place behind the PRD. Many people believed that the MPE would  be the winner and that it would be able to beat the PRD, a  traditional party. What happened? Was there some sort of  strategic mistake for the 94 elections?    [Blades] No. I believe there were a number of factors. On  the one hand, economic problems kept us from launching our  campaign earlier. Many people on the streets told us: If you  had started your campaign earlier, perhaps you would have had a  chance. This argument is not a solid argument, however. We  would not have been able to do this because we did not have the  economic means, on the one hand, nor the organization that we  needed at that time.    Additionally, we did not have a list of candidates. Any  group that begins, and begins broke and in a decent manner, and  I am going to repeat this over and over again -- in the history  of Panama there has never been a party like the MPE.  [unidentified voice says: "Never!"; followed by cheers and  applause]    Within that reality, within that reality [repeats himself]  we were never able to have a greater presence in our country's  rural areas -- given the lack of resources, organization, and so  on -- and we needed that. On a personal basis, everyone ganged  up against us. Let us call things by their name. The  partocracy [partidocracia] ganged up against us. A very  negative campaign was launched in recent weeks and, perhaps, it  yielded certain results. On a personal basis, we simply  accepted that as a test. We overcame that and we continued with  our efforts. The movement does not end. That is the good news  for the Panamanian people. The struggle continues. [applause,  shouts]    Second, I will tell you something. In the event, which  apparently occurs now, we lose the elections, in 1999 no one  will beat us. [applause, shouts] [chanting: "Ruben! Ruben!  Ruben"] This does not mean I will necessarily be the candidate  in 1999. That is something the national convention and the  national reality will decide, but I think the MPE and its roots  of decency are deeply planted. We will settle the situation of  slanders and other issues in the courts; and that begins  tomorrow. [applause, shouts]    [Reporter] Against whom will you file the lawsuit, Mr.  Blades?    [Blades] What?    [Reporter] Against whom will you file the lawsuit?    [Blades] We will file the lawsuit against the persons who  used false information to denigrate persons and ideas.    [Reporter] What party is involved?    [Blades] This is not a matter of parties, this is not a  matter of parties. [repeats himself] I previously said totally  absurd and groundless accusations have been issued. We will not  do this in terms of a vendetta, only because we believe the  conditions should be given in our country to clearly tell the  whole nation you cannot say a person is something he is not.    [Reporter] In what way do you feel offended?    [Blades] Look, it was said here that I was a gringo.  [unidentified woman laughs] It was said here that my diploma was  forged. [unidentified woman says: It was said he never attended  the university.] My mother, may she rest in peace, was attacked  here. My wife was attacked here. Well, that... [pauses] she  deplores it but we have discussed that issue and, well, such is  life. Anyway, people have said things that are not true.  Groups.... [pauses] persons within our group have been accused  of being members of a national organization -- I was accused of  being an employee of the government. In other words, a series  of accusations have been made and we will prove in a court of  law that they are false; and the people who published that will  pay [words indistinct]. [applause, shouts]    [Reporter] What will Ruben Blades' future be while this  happens? Will you remain in Panama? Will you continue to sing  and feature prominently at international level?    [Blades] Well, since you did not give me the job of  president  [laughter heard in the background] I have to work any way I can.  I have not worked for eight months. A lot of emphasis was  initially placed on the fact that I am a singer; and many people  in the media asked me: Well, will you stop singing? I always  asked them: If I were a painter, would you ask me to stop  painting? If I were a poet, would you ask me to stop writing?  That is part of an erroneous perception that an artist can only  play a superfluous role in our society.    This singer, because that is what I have always been and I  feel very proud of that, is a singer who has placed his role as  an artist, and his condition as a Panamanian, in a prominent  place at the world level [applause, shouts] and I continue to do  this in the measure of my possibilities. I feel absolutely no  shame about this. I believe that, quite the contrary, we have  given Panama a very positive image, and we have always continued  to extol the role of music as a means of communication.    The real question is whether I will stop taking part in the  political process and the reply is no. This is a categoric no.  We will continue our work; the MPE will not disappear, and it  will not disappear because it represents a banner of national  decency. We are not going to leave, we are not going to allow  other people to usurp what the people have given us. Something  else I want to say today is that in every tour people would say  to us.... [pauses] right, Ricardo [Bermudez]? Do not deceive  us, do not deceive us. You can be completely sure that this was  never our intention. The other thing people would say is we  will not see you again. We said we will return regardless of  whether we win or lose. The country can be totally sure that I  am going to return to all the places I visited to thank everyone  for all the support they gave us and to tell people that we will  continue to work and toil. [applause]    I believe this exercise has been very positive for the  country. I would like, please, for things to be seen in their  proper context. We have struggled with what we call vernacularly  the bullies [mayullones] in politics. [chuckles] We faced some  bullies and we fought clean. The bullies delivered low blows,  below the belt, but we did not fall. [applause]    This is not the right moment, on national network, to call  attention to these sorts of things, but we do need to say this  at the party level. Do you know what it takes to organize a  group in three years and that this group suddenly becomes the  second or third political force without resources or alliances?  [applause] What we simply did was to give shape to a national  thought and feeling. People want something different. I hope  and everyone hopes that the next government leads us in  resolving problems. Again, with all respect, and with our  current position as a political party of national importance, I  ask, please, that traditional political parties not interfere  negatively in the work of the elected government. We must move  ahead; we have no more time to lose in more fights, more  insults, more slander. Now we all have to work, time is running  out. The country needs immediate replies. We will continue to  contribute things. It is important that this be clearly  understood. I ask, please, all political parties. It is very  important that we now concentrate on the task of governing the  country, especially with the National Assembly.    It is important that we cast aside party rivalries; the  personal and selfish aspects so obvious with the country's  traditional political class. The MPE will not hinder the  national work because we are part of this work. I ask the other  parties to please not hinder the work of the national  government, whatever the party.

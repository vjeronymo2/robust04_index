			<p><P> April 4, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE;  </P> <P> MAN'S BODY IS FOUND AFTER HOUSE FIRE  </P> <P> A Garden Grove man died early Tuesday in a blaze that engulfed a single-family  home before firefighters could get to the scene, officials said.  </P> <P> The roof of the home, at 12552 Ocean Breeze Drive, collapsed shortly after  firefighters arrived around 12:30 a.m., said Ellen Covey, spokeswoman for the  Garden Grove Fire Department.  </P> <P> Seven fire trucks and 35 firefighters battled the blaze, which was contained in  about 45 minutes. Damage is estimated at $480,000, Covey said.  </P> <P> Paramedic Mark Munley was injured in the blaze and was sent to AMI Medical  Center of Garden Grove, where he was treated for second-degree burns.  </P> <P> Police identified the victim as Roy Lee Kelley, 58. He was discovered in a  bedroom of the house. The cause of the fire is under investigation.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, officials have determined that arson caused an unrelated fire Monday  night in a vacant building formerly owned by Kaiser Permanente, a hospital and  medical services company.  </P> <P> The one-time medical building at 11900 Gilbert St., now owned by the Garden  Grove Redevelopment Agency, sustained $400,000 in damage, Covey said. There  were no injuries in that fire, which spread to about one-third of the building.  </P> <P> The building was vacant for about three years, said Armando Morales,  real-property agent for the city of Garden Grove. The city purchased the  building and land from Kaiser Permanente in 1988 and had planned to lease the  facility, he said. MARY HELEN BERG  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["now./Ho." report: "Continuity in Foreign Policy Promised"] </F>   [Text] Brussels, 29 Apr -- During a two-day visit to  Brussels, Chairman Scharping of the Social Democratic Party of  Germany [SPD] stressed common points in the basic orientation of  the Social Democrats and the Federal Government in European  policy. In talks with NATO Secretary General Woerner, European  Union [EU] Commission President Delors, and members of the  European Parliament, Scharping promised continuity in foreign  policy if the SPD takes over the government after the Bundestag  elections in October. The SPD candidate for the chancellor's  office particularly mentioned the special relationship with  France in European policy, Germany's integration in NATO, and  the special relations with the United States, as well as  striving for reliable cooperation with the states in Central and  East Europe.    The Atlantic Alliance is more than just a defense alliance  --  it is a decisive element of European security policy, Scharping  said. In addition to a "substantial presence" of the United  States and Canada in Europe, Russia, too, must play a "special  role," Scharping stated. Asked in which respect the foreign  policy concepts of the Federal Government and the SPD opposition  are different, the politician said that concurrence in the basic  orientation is "not bad." However, Scharping criticized the  Federal Government's negative attitude toward certain ideas of  the EU Commission to stimulate economic growth as well as the  inappropriate "style and tone" of Foreign Minister Kinkel's  negotiations in the internal EU quarrel over future voting in  the Council of Ministers. In addition, he complained that  Chancellor Kohl is increasingly alone in the Christian  Democratic Union/Christian Social Union with his dedication to  European policy because there "the trend toward nationalism has  clearly" become "stronger."    Previously, speaking to members of the Social Democratic  group of the European Parliament, Scharping clearly advocated  the enlargement of the EU by Austria, Finland, Norway, and  Sweden. A few days before the vote in Strasbourg, he called on  the still hesitating deputies -- mainly from France, Belgium,  and Italy -- to approve the membership treaties. Criticism of  the insufficient "deepening" of the EU and the politically and  juridically dubious compromise on the future blocking minority  in the Council of Ministers is not reason enough to postpone the  vote next Wednesday [4 May]. "Deepening" and "enlarging" the EU  are, furthermore, not a contradiction. The Central and East  European reform states, too, must not be left alone by the EU;  they must be given a clear prospect for membership soon, even if  they will probably not be mature enough for full membership in  the next 10 years. One must not be discouraged by problems in  everyday politics in the West and stick to the "great vision and  opportunity" to bring together the peoples and states in the  West and East. The parliament must be involved in the EU  reforms planned for 1996; its rights in the legislative process  must be strengthened.    Mr. Haensch, the top candidate of the Social Democrats for  the European election on 12 June, said that in the future the  European deputies must be able to make decisions, on an equal  footing with the Council of Ministers, in those fields where the  governments make majority decisions. The requirement that all  12 governments have to agree unanimously is to be limited to  amendments to the EU Treaty as well as to certain decisions that  affect finances.</p>

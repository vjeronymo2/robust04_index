			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATURE SHOWS THE WAY ON FRIENDLY MOLOKAI  </P> <P> Molokai, known for a century for its infamous leper colony, has always been a  bit off the tourist track. But "The Friendly Isle" has a lot to offer --  particularly for the hiker and nature lover.  </P> <P> If you want to get away from it all, Molokai is definitely away from it all.  The island has a couple of beaches, a lush rain forest, some very modest  resorts and a natural Hawaiian beauty second to none. What the island doesn't  have is night life or even one single stoplight.  </P> <P> On the tiny island is Hawaii's largest expanse of old-growth tropical forest.  With a little time and effort, the intrepid hiker can discover what Kamakou  Preserve Manager Ed Misaki calls "the real Hawaii."  </P> <P> Three of my favorite Molokai hikes include:  </P> <P>  -- Kalaupapa National Historic Park, which was set aside in 1980 to preserve  the former place of exile for victims of Hansen's disease (leprosy). For a  century, those suffering from mai hookaawale (separating sickness) were  isolated from the rest of the world by the steep lava walls of the Kalaupapa  Peninsula.  </P> <P> By the 1960s, the development of sulfone drugs had brought Hansen's disease  under control, but many sufferers, isolated for so long from the outside world,  elected to stay. The historic settlement, formerly a place of almost  unbelievable misery, is now open to guided tours; the tour leaders are the  residents themselves, with help from the National Park Service.  </P> <P> On the tour, visitors view the homes, hospital facilities and stores of the  settlement, as well as the church built by the courageous Father Damien, who  arrived in 1873 to work with the afflicted exiles in what was often referred to  as a "living tomb." After much good work, Father Damien himself eventually  contracted leprosy and died.  </P> <P> Ironically, although long a place of the damned, the Kalaupapa Peninsula is one  of the most beautiful places in all of Hawaii. Don't miss the short walk  through Palaau State Park, which provides a panoramic overlook of the  peninsula. Another trail leads through tall pine trees to much-photographed  Phallic Rock.  </P> <P> The Molokai Mule Ride (about $80) is the way most people visit the Kalaupapa  settlement. However, you can hike down for about $30. Even if you hike, you  must sign up for a tour. It's a six-mile round-trip trek, with 26 switchbacks  and a 1,600-foot elevation drop. (Save some energy for the steep uphill return  trip.)  </P> <P> At the bottom of the trail, hikers join the mule riders for a guided walking  and bus tour of Kalaupapa National Historic Park. The tour includes a box  lunch. For more information, contact Molokai Mule Ride, P.O. Box 200, Kualapuu,  Molokai, Hawaii 96757, (800) 843-5978. On the island: 567-6088.  </P> <P>  -- Halawa Valley. Located on the extreme east end of the island, this is a  good introduction to the joys of tripping afoot on Molokai.  </P> <P> In the valley are some of Hawaii's oldest village sites, dating to AD 650. For  many centuries farmers cultivated taro on hillside terraces here. Halawa Valley  is about 20 miles from the isle's main town of Kaunakakai. The drive along  Kamehameha V Highway (450) to the valley passes ancient fish ponds, churches,  black-sand beaches and historic markers.  </P> <P> At the end of the highway is the trail head for the path through Halawa Valley.  The trail leads two sometimes-muddy miles past taro patches and guava, and  through a green jungle to Moaula Falls. The falls fills a rock-rimmed basin,  which is one of the more scenic swimming pools you'll ever see, though kind of  chilly.  </P> <P>  -- Kawiakou Preserve. Under the watchful eye of the Nature Conservancy, this  area protects a wondrous rain forest. More than 200 plants grow here and  nowhere else in the world.  </P> <P> You reach the preserve by driving up a muddy road (sometimes impassable)  through slopes forested with cedar, eucalyptus and Monterey cypress. Waikolu  (Three Waters) Overlook offers grand views of waterfalls and steep cliffs.  </P> <P> The first part of the trail through the preserve is on a narrow wooden  boardwalk that leads through Pepeopae Bog, believed to be 10,000 years old.  Violets and orchids brighten the primordial ooze. Some plants are but dwarfs of  their species, while others, such as giant tree ferns, grow to astonishing  heights.  </P> <P> It's possible to visit the preserve on your own, but an even better way to go  is to join one of the occasional guided walking tours given by the Nature  Conservancy.  </P> <P> Contact the Molokai Preserves Manager, Box 40, Kualapuu, Molokai 96757, (808)  567-6680.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hiking / Hawaii  </P> <P> Molokai Trails  </P> <P> Where: Kalaupapa National Historic Park, Halawa Valley, Kamakou Preserve.  </P> <P> Length: 2-6 miles round trip per walk.  </P> <P> Terrain: Tropical rain forest, coastal bluffs.  </P> <P> Highlights: Waterfalls, isolated beaches, distinct flora.  </P> <P> Degree of Diffculty: Easy, moderate and strenuous.  </P> <P> Precautions: Muddy, slippery trails.  </P></p>

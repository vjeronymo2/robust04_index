			<p><P> July 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGH COST OF THE B-2 STEALTH BOMBER  </P> <P> As I watched the TV news footage of the B-2 bomber fly into reality I was  filled with sadness.  </P> <P> $500,000,000 a copy (count the zeros!) to construct a machine to threaten and  to oppress. Is this how we solve our fears?  </P> <P> It amazes me how we justify our priorities. We are told constructing these  bombers employs thousands of people so they can finance their lives and rear  their children.  </P> <P> We are taking blood money for making machines whose sole purpose is the death  and destruction of our fellow citizens on this earth. Then we go home and teach  our children to be loving and caring people?  </P> <P> MORAN de MUSEE  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

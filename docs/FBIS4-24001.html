			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with President Bakili Muluzi in London </F> by correspondent Veronica Edwards on 16 June; from the "Network  Africa" program]    [Text] Just yesterday on Network, we were hearing the  reactions of some people to the departure of Dr. Hastings Banda,  Malawi's erstwhile life president, from the presidential Sanjika  Palace in Blantyre, making way for the country's newly elected  president, Bakili Muluzi. Well, Mr. Muluzi is currently in  London on his way from the OAU summit. Back home, his United  Democratic Front [UDF] government has been criticized as being  selfish in its allocation of cabinet portfolios and not giving  any of the important posts to the opposition, Aford [Alliance  for Democracy] party of Mr. Chakufwa Chihana. Last night in his  hotel room, Veronica Edwards spoke to him and asked him first  what it felt like to be taking over after so many years of  one-man, one-party rule in Malawi.    [Begin recording] [Muluzi] Let me just mention one thing,  Veronica. What is important to me is not the presidency at all.  I think what is important to me is that, for the first time in  30 years, the people of Malawi had the opportunity to cast their  vote, choose a government of their choice, and at least they are  now people living like people. Now, when you ask me how I feel,  yes I feel very proud, but not proud because of my presidency  but proud that at last the people of Malawi can express  themselves. I think that is more important to me. It is more  satisfying.    [Edwards] So, what about the negotiations with Aford. Are  you still going to try hard to bring them into the new  government?    [Muluzi] We have left the door open. Let me tell you one  thing. I am one of those who have been saying that a leader  never closes a door. We have left the door open and we are  saying to Aford: Anytime they want to join the government, they  are most welcome. Mind you, we may belong to different parties,  but in the end, let me emphasize again, we are Malawians. We  are working together. We should work together for the  betterment of our people. I think that is more important. So, I  am saying yes. We had two technical committees to look at the  issues of, not necessarily collision but of working together,  accommodating everybody. So, indeed those negotiations are  going on and in fact there are three ministries which I left  vacant deliberately, hoping that they would come and join us,  and they will be welcome anytime.    [Edwards] But Aford seems to think that the three ministries  that you are talking about are of no substance. They think they  should actually be involved in (?important) ministries in the  country.    [Muluzi] Let them tell me what is important. Is it a  position? To me, a position does not very much count to me. Let  me stress one thing. If you ask me, I have never been an  ambitious person. I have never wanted to be president of  Malawi. If, for example, Aford had won the election, if my good  friend Chihana had won the election, I would have extended my  hand and congratulated him, because I think what is important,  as I told you, is not the presidency, but that, for the first  time in Malawi, people are free. I think we should not be  looking for positions, because if we do look for positions, then  I think the whole thing is misunderstood.    [Edwards] If you can't get Aford, your party's minority  position in Parliament could damage its legislative program and  this could further alienate the northern sentiments. You don't  want this to happen, because right now the people in the north  seem to think they have been left out and they are angry. They  are not happy with what is going on. You don't want this to  happen, do you?    [Muluzi] No, I don't think you would say they are angry. Who  are angry? I don't think you would say that. Mind you, in the  cabinet we have, there are five ministers from the northern  region. What you may not say is that they are members of  Parliament. They are not members of Parliament, but we have  five ministers from central [as heard] region and in addition to  this, we are saying that we can offer three, four ministries.  So, to say that they are angry, I wouldn't want to agree with  you on that one. I think this question of talking about the  northern region, the central region, the southern regions, these  things should go. We are all Malawians, and I am appealing to  those people who think regionalism--as I said earlier in  interviews--that there is no place in the new Malawi for anybody  who would like to divide the country. There is no place for him  in the new Malawi. We want people who are going to think  nationalistic, not regionalistic, because if you do that, how  can you build the country?    [Edwards] Finally, I would like to know this: Now that you  are president and the former president has now finally moved  away from the political scene. How would you treat him?    [Muluzi] Let me just mention that he has not moved away from  the political scene. He is the president, I am told, life  president of the Malawi Congress Party [MCP]. Therefore, he is  the leader of MCP. If the question is: He has ceased to be  head of state. Yes, he has. What I have done, what my  government has done is to assure him that we will look after  him. He has been president of Malawi for 30 years. He has made  a contribution to Malawi. It is something that we cannot  forget. We will definitely look after him, give him a pension,  befitting a former head of state. What we would like to  actually show to the world and to the politicians that are  coming in future is to say that there is always life after State  House. There is always and there has been a tendency in Africa  that whenever a former head of state has been replaced, the only  place where he must go is prison. I think we must avoid that.  I think politicians should have a future. I definitely do not  believe in retribution. I don't believe in vengeance, because  where do you stop? So, we will look after him. He is a  Malawian.

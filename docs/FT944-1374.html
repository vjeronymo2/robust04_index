			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Portals bid news expected Specialist paper group Portals jumped 45 to 965p as the company's executive directors held face to face negotiations with their counterparts from De La Rue, the banknote printer. The boards of the two groups spent much of yesterday thrashing out details that are expected to lead to a killer bid worth in excess of Pounds 10 a share from De La Rue. It is believed that the highest amount De La Rue could justifiably pay would be 1025p per share, which would value Portals at Pounds 665m. There will be an announcement this week, possibly as early as tomorrow. One insider said: 'With the share price swinging around like this and nobody knowing what is going on, there is in effect a false market. They have to say something.' This is the second time this year that De La Rue has declared its interest in Portals, and analysts believe that if it backs away again there would be a damaging loss of face and De La Rue would be forced to launch a hostile bid  - something it has shied away from because of the historically close relationship between the two groups. De La Rue firmed a penny to 956p.</p>

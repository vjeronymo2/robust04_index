			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Crackdown on Criminal Trading: Inside out - the Stock Exchange goes on crusade / Robert Peston goes on campaign with the squad that aims to make sure all deals are above board A crusade is being launched by Mr Michael Lawrence, the London Stock Exchange's chief executive, to make the market safer for investors who do not have inside information. He is taking a series of measures to ensure that anyone buying and selling shares through a London securities house will not be severely disadvantaged if he or she has access only to published information. 'The lack of certainty in the market (which makes it difficult for an investor to make a rational investment decision) damages our reputation,' he said. 'I want us to do all we can to ensure that the market is orderly.' Part of the way to achieve that, he believes, is for the exchange to be doubly vigilant in its attempt to detect and investigate possible insider traders, or those who make illegal profits from trading in shares when in possession of confidential price-sensitive information. But Mr Lawrence admited: 'There is a limit to what we can do. We investigate, but it's up to the Department of Trade and Industry to decide whether to prosecute'. In the 14 years since insider trading became illegal in the UK, there have been just 23 successful prosecutions and only two in the past two years. Part of the reason for this record is widely believed to lie in the criminal, as opposed to civil, nature of the misdemeanour. A criminal case requires proof beyond reasonable doubt. The requirement of proving that someone possessed inside information when dealing - and then proving that the motive for the transaction was to profit from that information and that there was no other motive - has frequently proved impossible to fulfil. Only the government can decide whether to introduce a new civil law, with a lower burden of proof, to cover insider trading. But although the exchange cannot change the law, it is not immune from the effects of the current one. Mr Lawrence said: 'My concern is that the exchange itself is brought into disrepute if there is not enough punishment.' All he can do for now is to improve the exchange's own detection and investigation procedures, so as to expose as many insider traders as possible. 'We do not want to have an image of London as a place where insiders can trade easily and get away with it,' he said. To provide an insight into the exchange's role in the battle against insider trading, the articles below include a genuine insider-trading case - heavily disguised with the names and dates changed because the investigation is still 'live' - and a detailed account of the operations of the exchange's Surveillance Group, responsible for detecting and investigating any criminal activity linked to share trading.</p>

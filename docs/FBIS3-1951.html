On the other Hand, Liu Huaqing, vice chairman of the  Central Military Commission, pointed out at a recent all-Army  meeting on fighting corruption and advocating clean conduct that  the Army's anticorruption drive must uphold high standards.    Since implementation in China of the polices of reform,  opening up, and the market economy, the income gap between the  Army and the local authorities has continuously widened, and the  social status of soldiers has fallen. Some military units "are  not content with lagging behind," so they try hard to make  money. The Chinese Army already had the "tradition" of engaging  in production and operation, so military units and soldiers have  become increasingly active in business operations, to the extent  that news has continued to arrive about the military using  military equipment in smuggling activities. These phenomena not  only lower the quality of the Army and hurt its image, but also  shake the minds of soldiers.    According to informed sources, the Central Military  Commission already has decided to "maintain a clean and honest  Army with high salaries," so as to combat corruption and  reestablish the good image of the Chinese military. According  to information, wages for officers -- from the level of Central  Military Commission chairman to the regiment, company, and  platoon levels -- will be greatly adjusted, and their wages will  be higher than those of government officials at the same level  by several times. For example, an officer at the division level  will earn more than 1,000 yuan, whereas a public servant at the  corresponding department or bureau level in the government will  not earn more than 700 yuan, according to the new wage system.  According to information, the chairman of the Central Military  Commission will make more than 3,000 yuan, which is much higher  than that for the premier.    Informed sources said that the measure adopted by the Army  is  at least aimed at restoring the sense of honor and the  relatively superior living standard and status of soldiers  characteristic of the time shortly after the CPC came to power.  In the 1950's and '60's, the pay of a soldier on the mainland  was higher than that of a local government official at the  corresponding level by two "administrative ranks" (about 30  percent higher).    Some scholars in Beijing also have proposed that the Army  should be strictly banned from doing business, that the Army  must be maintained by revenues, and that the Chinese Army's  traditional function of being a "production brigade" must be  changed and that links between the Army and commercial  activities must be completely severed.    On the other hand, Liu Huaqing, member of the Standing  Committee of the Political Bureau and vice chairman of the  Central Military Commission, stressed at a recent all-Army  meeting on discipline inspection that the work to combat  corruption and advocate clean conduct within the Army must  uphold high standards.    XINHUA quoted Liu Huaqing as saying that under the new  situation, the Army shoulders a great historic mission and must  provide a strong and forceful security guarantee to the  country's reform, opening up, and modernization construction.  The Army certainly has to do better in the building of party  work style and honesty, which is an important aspect of the  spiritual civilization construction. Party committees and  leaders at various levels must uphold high standards, meet  strict demands, and further enhance their awareness and sense of  responsibility for anticorruption work and honesty.    Liu Huaqing said that the senior cadres within the Army must  have a sense of the overall situation and must strictly abide by  political discipline. They must resolutely implement whatever  things are decided by the CPC Central Committee and the Central  Military Commission, refrain from doing whatever has been banned  by orders, and honestly do whatever is stipulated by systems, so  as to really toe the party line politically, mentally, and  practically. Leading cadres, especially senior cadres, must have  deeds conforming to words in being honest and self-disciplined,  and earnestly practice what they advocate. They must strictly  enforce the various systems and regulations in the area of party  work style and clean government building that have been  stipulated by the CPC Central Committee and the Central Military  Commission, and must be a model in serving the people  wholeheartedly and in enforcing discipline.</p>

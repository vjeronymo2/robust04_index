			<p><P> June 26, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOUGHNUT MAKER FEELS RIVALS' BITE;  </P> <P> CHAIN SUFFERS MANY MANAGEMENT CHANGES, ENCROACHMENT BY INDEPENDENTS  </P> <P> When the urge for a doughnut would strike, Ed Garza used to drive off to the  nearest Winchell's Donut House.  </P> <P> Now, with doughnuts being sold in nearly every mini-mall and corner convenience  store, Garza, a Pasadena medical products salesman, says he can be more choosy.  His current favorite: Big Mama's, a shop in Highland Park where the doughnuts  are "bigger and better" than Winchell's, he says.  </P> <P> "I go to Winchell's less because of all the other doughnut places," Garza said.  </P> <P> Winchell's Donut Houses have been shaken by the loss of customers such as  Garza, who have taken their appetites for jelly doughnuts and bear claws  elsewhere. The once robust Winchell's chain -- its yellow-and-brown signs a  common Southern California sight -- has been beset by management mistakes and  hordes of new rivals, analysts say.  </P> <P> Winchell's, the nation's second-largest chain behind Dunkin Donuts, has lost  money two years in a row, and store sales have kept falling despite recent  attempts to turn the 650-shop chain around. Last year, Winchell's lost $12.8  million on sales of $145 million.  </P> <P> Three weeks ago, La Mirada-based Winchell's officials, who declined to be  interviewed for this story, said they were considering selling the chain.  Winchell's is 42% owned by the Denny's coffee shop chain, which in turn is  owned by New York-based TW Services. TW has agreed to be acquired by an  investment group.  </P> <P> "The name has been allowed to deteriorate," said Ward Lindenmayer, a San  Francisco-based retail analyst who used to follow Winchell's. "They have been  allowed to get sloppy and dirty. There isn't a whole lot of things going for  it."  </P> <P> Competing doughnut operators have watched the decline of Winchell's and the  numerous changes in top management -- four presidents in the past five years --  and ownership.  </P> <P> "They keep changing hands and that's hard on the person who's making a living  in the store," said Joe Apodaca, who has operated Georgia's doughnuts in South  Central Los Angeles for nearly 30 years.  </P> <P> Until recently, many Winchell stores had gone years without remodeling and were  often staffed by a single person for most of the day and at night. Low-paid  managers had little incentive to provide the high level of customer service  many in the industry say is necessary to compete effectively.  </P> <P> "I think they have been hurt very badly over the years," said one doughnut  chain operator. "They don't have the fine reputation today that they used to  have."  </P> <P> The chain is the namesake of Verne H. Winchell, who opened the first shop in  Temple City in 1948, after trying his hand at selling used cars and jukeboxes.  </P> <P> After a rocky start, the chain blossomed. In 1968, Denny's purchased the then  200-store operation in return for stock, and Winchell became chairman of the  coffee shop chain until 1980.  </P> <P> When Denny's was converted into a privately owned firm in 1984, Winchell  received about $51 million for his shares -- the fruit of the $27,000 he  invested in the first Winchell's store four decades earlier. Winchell could not  be reached for comment for this story.  </P> <P> Under Denny's, Winchell's grew rapidly. The number of stores reached nearly  1,000 by the late 1970s, and Winchell's soon opened in Japan and South Korea.  </P> <P> Winchell's also took another fateful step under Denny's -- in 1971, it bought  out its franchisees and converted all outlets to company-owned stores.  </P> <P> "It was a huge mistake," said Lindenmayer. "You couldn't pay enough to motivate  the store employees. It's not a prestigious job and it's monotonous. The only  incentive you have is if you own it."  </P> <P> In contrast, Boston-based Dunkin Donuts, with more than 1,786 stores  nationwide, is almost entirely operated by franchisees. The chain, which is  fighting a takeover launched by two Canadian firms, has seen sales and profits  grow steadily during the past five years.  </P> <P> Besides unmotivated store managers, Winchell's also suffered from disinterested  executives at Denny's after Verne Winchell departed, Lindenmayer says. The  executives saw little need to put money into a sluggish doughnut chain.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Winchell's faced growing numbers of competitors, including in-house  bakeries at supermarkets, convenience stores and the countless numbers of  mom-and-pop shops that seem to inhabit every Los Angeles mini-mall.  </P> <P> "All of a sudden you got hundreds if not thousands of outlets selling  doughnuts," Lindenmayer. "It's convenient to buy doughnuts at Safeway if you  are there already."  </P> <P> Winchell's has fought back with the introduction of creme-filled croissants and  in-store ovens to bake muffins. The chain has closed about 200 poorly  performing stores and once again began selling franchises in 1985.  </P> <P> The company has even joined forces with competitors. Winchell's doughnuts are  sold at more than 600 7-Eleven convenience stores in Southern and Central  California. "We are delighted with the program," said Don Cowan, a spokesman  for the 7-Eleven chain. "It has added incremental sales to our stores."  </P> <P> But store sales at Winchell's continue to slide. Average store sales have sunk  to $207,000 in 1988 from $217,000 in 1984.  </P> <P> The company also faces numerous lawsuits related to its conversion to a  publicly traded limited partnership in December, 1986. Investors paid $18 a  share for Winchell's only to see the price fall below $4.  </P> <P> Despite its many problems, Winchell's large network of stores in California has  drawn interest. Dunkin Donuts, which has only a handful of stores in  California, says it might be interested in parts of the chain but is not saying  whether it is looking to put forward a bid.  </P> <P> Arthur S. Pfefferman, chairman of Woodland Hills-based Donut Inn, a 32-store  chain, said he is putting together a bid for Winchell's. "The network of stores  is attractive," Pfefferman said. "But they have many locations that we would  not approve."  </P> <P> Pfefferman is also counting on a loyal corps of Winchell's customers who have  grown up with Winchell's.  </P> <P> "Winchell's is an institution," said Octavio Lopez, 36, after his daily morning  stop at one of the chain's shops in Glendale. "When somebody asks 'Where do you  want to go have a doughnut?,' hell, I go to Winchell's."  </P></p>

			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Monopoly is found in supply of parts THE commission's report into the supply of car parts UK finds that a complex monopoly exists in favour of carmakers, but that there are no practices operating against the public interest. The commission says there is active competition between component suppliers and in wholesaling to the independent sector. However, there is still little direct competition in supply to the carmakers' franchised dealers, in spite of the partial removal of exclusive purchasing requirements after the commission's investigation of cars parts in 1982. The complex monopoly exists, the commission says, because carmakers use one or more of the following restrictive practices in supplying parts to their franchised dealers: Taking account of parts sales in calculating general dealer bonuses and rebates, which was an inducement for dealers to sell the maker's parts. Preventing dealers from acting as distributors for suppliers of competing parts. Refusing to supply branded parts except to their own franchised dealers. Withholding diagnostic equipment or related information required for servicing their cars from persons other than their dealers. Applying conditions that restrict the ability of com-ponent manufacturers to supply the independent sector.</p>

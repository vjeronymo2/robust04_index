This false information is aimed at spoiling the  good relationship between Eritrea and all Yemenis, both north  and south, the statement noted.    Today's statement reiterated that Eritrea's stance on the  Yemeni conflict was clearly expressed in a Foreign Ministry  statement issued on 5 May 1994. The Eritrean Government noted  that the ongoing war among the Yemeni brothers was unacceptable  to the government and again urged both the conflicting Yemeni  sides to halt the war and solve their problems through dialogue.</p>

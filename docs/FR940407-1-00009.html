			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Bombardier Inc. has issued de Havilland Service Bulletin S.B. 8&hyph;32&hyph;99, Revision `A,' dated July 26, 1993, that describes procedures for modification of the potentiometer lever stops on the nose wheel steering (Modification 8/1809) on certain Model DHC&hyph;8&hyph;100 and &hyph;300 series airplanes. Accomplishment of this modification will restore overtravel protection by relocating the potentiometer lever stops. Relocation of the stops will ensure that excessive fork lever movement is restricted in the event of a mechanical link failure. Transport Canada Aviation classified this service bulletin as mandatory and issued Canadian Airworthiness Directive (AD) No. CF&hyph;93&hyph;24, dated September 29, 1993, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in Canada.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the effectivity of the service bulletin includes certain Model DHC&hyph;8&hyph;100 and &hyph;300 series airplanes, Canadian AD No. CF&hyph;93&hyph;24 is applicable only to certain Model DHC&hyph;8&hyph;100 series airplanes. The service bulletin states that the potentiometer stops on certain Model DHC&hyph;8&hyph;300 series airplanes are contacted by the lever prematurely, resulting in deformation of the stops. However, the FAA has been advised that, although deformation of the potentiometer stops on these airplanes can occur, excessive potentiometer lever movement would still be restricted in the event of failure of a mechanical link. In light of this information, the FAA finds that Model DHC&hyph;8&hyph;300 series airplanes are not subject to the addressed unsafe condition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This airplane model is manufactured in Canada and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, Transport Canada Aviation has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of Transport Canada Aviation, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require modification of the potentiometer lever stops on the nose wheel steering. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA estimates that 48 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 3 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. The cost for required parts would be minimal. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $7,920, or $165 per airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> The Proposed Amendment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend 14 CFR part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=2 --> PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> 1.

			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: CU switch Commercial Union came under fire in a generally soggy composite insurance arena as Credit Lyonnais Laing highlighted the impact on CU's balance sheet of the Group Victoire acquisition and recommended a straight sell of CU shares or a switch into Royal Insurance or Guardian. CLL's insurance team described the acquisition as 'well timed from a pure insurance viewpoint', but questioned the long term strategy of purchasing a company which relies on third party distribution when technological developments suggest more business will eventually go direct. The broker estimated that CU's net asset value had been diluted to a current level of 450p and anticipated initial earnings dilution of 10 to 15 per cent. CU shares declined 9 to 535p on turnover of 2.2m, while Royal was only 2 off at 282p on 2.3m traded and Guardian a penny easier at 192p. Barclays outshone other leading banks, moving up 3 to 567p in response to positive noises from Hoare Govett, which was said to have lunched with senior officials from Barclays on Tuesday and reiterated its positive stance on the stock. Lloyds Bank, on the other hand, continued to suffer from Tuesday's news that Sir David Walker, the deputy chairman, is leaving the bank to join Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank. Lloyds dipped 10 more to 554p. Lloyds also played a part in the decline of Standard Chartered shares, which lost 6 at 269p on relatively high volume of 3.8m as dealers picked up whispers that Lloyds may at last be ready to dispose of its 4.7 per cent stake in Standard, some 45m shares. Lloyds acquired its holding in Standard in the early 1980s when it unsuccessfully bid for the bank. Two big individual trades, one of 1.4m shares at 352p and another of 800,000 at the same price, said to have been executed by Swiss Bank Corporation, were the catalyst for the strong upward move by Scottish Power, which settled 5 higher at 353p. Turnover in Power reached a hefty 4.8m. BTR was hit by a sell note squall, sliding to 305p at one stage before closing 2 off at 309p in 12m turnover. Credit Lyonnais Laing, unhappy with the pressure on the company's profits margins and concerned about earnings dilution through impending warrant conversions, is telling clients to sell. Smiths Industries put on 7 at 447p following strong results, although it was the 13p dividend - against market hopes for 12.5p - that provided most of the underpinning for the shares. British Steel, the most heavily traded Footsie stock with 16m shares changing hands, eased 3 1/2 to 159p as doubts about the shares' ability to outperform the market continued to trigger substantial position taking. The high turnover was mirrored by very active options business. Senior Engineering continued to rally, moving up 4 to 82p on the back of attempts by the company to reassure City institutions that this year's forecast profits upset is largely an isolated affair. NatWest Securities' latest property note was something of a mixed blessing for the sector yesterday, with British Land receding 5 to 398p and Brixton Estates 4 to 195p. The securities house expects share price discounts to asset values to widen by a third to 20 per cent on average over the next 12 months and has moved its stance to neutral. But the house was not uniformly downbeat. Its advice to switch from Brixton Estates to Slough Estates helped to push the latter up 3 to 227p in turnover of 2.4m. Equally, an upgrade of Hammerson's net asset value to 396p following the company's big Australian disposal spurred the shares up 2 to 337p. Price softness at Grand Metropolitan stood out in an otherwise resilient drinks sector - Guinness put on 2 at 463p and Scottish &amp; Newcastle added 4 at 508p - with the weakness of the dollar helping to push the shares down 5 to 416p. More than half of GrandMet's turnover arises in the US. Paper group Bowater fell 12 to 452p after dealers said SG Warburg removed the stock from its buy list. The house shaved profits forecasts but remained positive over long term prospects. Publisher Harrington Kilbride dropped 10 to 42p after announcing a first-half loss and passing its interim dividend. Shop fitter Havelock Europa jumped 18 to 188p as it restored the interim dividend for the first time in three years. Bullish comments from David Sainsbury, chairman of Britain's biggest supermarket group, propped up the food retailers yesterday. Argyll gained 2 at 269p and J. Sainsbury a penny at 399p, while Asda and Tesco were steady. Other statistics, Page 47</p>

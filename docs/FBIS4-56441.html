			<p>BFN     [Text] Last night, the Legislative Assembly approved a  series of constitutional reforms affecting individual rights,  public health, economic order, and the judicial branch.    The reform of Subparagraph 2 of Article 11 establishes that  a  person has the right to a writ of habeas corpus when any  individual or authority illegally or arbitrarily restricts his  or her liberty. This is also applicable when any authority  attacks the mental or physical wellbeing of those people  detained.    Modifications to Article 17 state that no government branch,  official, or authority may use expired procedures in pending  legal cases or to start legal proceedings against individuals.    Regarding health, an amendment to Article 68 establishes  that  the Public Health Higher Council shall comprise representatives  from the fields of medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, veterinary  medicine, clinical laboratory science, nursing, and psychiatry.  Congress also reformed Article 120, which now reads: "All  concessions granted by the state to exploit harbors, railroads,  canals, or other public holdings require that terms and  conditions be set while taking into account the nature of the  projects and the investment required."    Regarding distribution of the state budget, the judicial  branch will be entitled to an annual allotment of not less than  4 percent of the overall budget. This includes the National  Judiciary Council and the National Lawyers and Notary Public  Council. The Prosecutor General's Office, the Attorney  General's Office, and the Human Rights Ombudsman will together  have an annual assignment of not less than 2 percent of the  budget.</p>

			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Miners delay raid on Bucharest Militant Romanian coal miners yesterday postponed a planned raid on the capital like the ones that in the past toppled a prime minister and crushed a protest movement, Reuter reports from Bucharest. Some 2,000 striking miners clad in overalls and armed with clubs had rallied outside the offices of the Tirgu Jiu lignite company in the western Jiu Valley ready to head for Bucharest, about 250km to the east. But they decided on a delay after the minority left-wing government, facing a deepening labour crisis, stood firm and said it would punish militant union leader Miron Cosma if the march went ahead. The miners decided to wait while their leaders went to Bucharest for fresh talks today on their demands for bonuses and resignations of some officials. 'The miners postponed their raid on Bucharest. . . They said they would send union leaders to Bucharest to negotiate with the government on Friday,' local journalist Nicolae Brinzan told Reuters. In 1990 miners led by Mr Cosma answered a call by President Ion Iliescu to crush a protest movement and in September 1991 the miners toppled reformist Prime Minister Petre Roman. At least nine people were killed in the two expeditions.</p>

			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Election 92: Quotes of the day People in a democracy respect a leader who will say: 'I have not been right all the way down the line, I have no monopoly of wisdom' Neil Kinnock I am humble enough to recognise that I have made mistakes but politically astute enough to know that I have forgotten what they are Michael Heseltine Someone once said of John Smith that were he a double-glazing salesman, every house in England would be double-glazed.  I'm sure that's true. But would the measurements be right? Norman Lamont He (Neil Kinnock) does have the air of a chicken pecking at a lot of corn on the ground when he is speaking Norman Tebbit I think he (John Major) chose the wrong people to run the campaign, although I'm bound to say it reminded me very much of the trial of the Titanic we had where even if he'd done it right the Titanic would still have sunk Dennis Healey Gladstone had a soapbox, Churchill had a soapbox and they were both elected prime minister John Major Simple people use them Neil Kinnock, on soapboxes</p>

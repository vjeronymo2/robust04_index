			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Reform Scanning" Column: "Some SEZs Are To Be Converted </F> Into Free Trade Zones in Wake of China `Regaining GATT  Membership'"]    [Text] According to GATT's nondiscrimination principle,  after "being admitted to" GATT, the relevant country must ensure  unified implementation of the agreement nationwide. In GATT's  view, introducing special policies will affect unified  implementation of the foreign trade system throughout the  relevant country and will thus create an environment for unequal  competition, weakening the central government's ability to  fulfill its GATT obligations. Therefore, preferential policies  granted to special economic zones [SEZs] and development zones  will be gradually withdrawn. In its 12-point suggestions, GATT  demanded that China abolish the different investment and  taxation policies applied in different regions.    The SEZs Office pointed out: When China is admitted to GATT,  the discrepancy between local policies will disappear gradually  and the market system will be adjusted according to the  international practice represented by GATT. In future, there  will be only differences in the development of a fully fledged  market rather than in market policies. Naturally, since the  SEZs have set up a complete set of market systems which suit the  international economic pattern on the strength of preferential  policies, they will possibly continue to lead the way in  building a fully fledged market.    At present, some places are still vying with one another to  introduce preferential policies. The SEZs Office believes it is  necessary to draw lessons from the growth of the SEZs. The  unparalleled role played by policies will come to naught with  the gradual improvement of the market and legal systems.  Policies can only play a role for a short period.</p>

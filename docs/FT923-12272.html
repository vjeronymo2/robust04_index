			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / EDF seeks go-ahead for reactor order THE world's most nuclear-dependent electricity monopoly, Electricite de France (EDF), has asked the French government for clearance to order its first new nuclear reactor for five years, William Dawkins reports from Paris. This could hamper the Socialist administration's attempt to court France's influential ecology parties in the run-up to the general election next March. The moderate Generation Ecologie wants a freeze on nuclear power, while the Verts, or Greens, want to ban it. Between them they won nearly 14 per cent of the vote in last March's regional elections. The government will therefore be under pressure to put off a decision until after the general election. However the EDF says it must order a new reactor early next year to cope with growth in electricity demand.</p>

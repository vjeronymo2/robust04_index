			<p>BFN     [Text] Lagos, 24 May (NAN) -- The Federal Government has  not began withdrawing Nigerian troops currently serving in the  ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire  Monitoring Group] peace keeping operations in Liberia, the  director of defence information, Brig.-Gen. Fred Chijuka, [words  indistinct].    Chijuka [words indistinct] while chatting with newsmen  explained that the government had, however, decided that no  additional troops would be deployed to Liberia. He further  explained that the plan and feeling among the military  authorities was that the country should start reducing its  troops in Liberia, as soon as other African countries expected  to contribute troops had done so. The withdrawal of the troops,  Brig.-Gen. Chijuka said, would effectively commence when troops  from the expected countries had taken over some of the areas  currently manned by Nigerian troops.    The defence spokesman noted that the situation in Liberia  was  gradually improving as no faction was currently fighting with  the peace keeping force. He, however, said that heavy equipment  requiring maintenance after use in the ECOMOG operations was  being returned to Nigeria. It will be recalled that Nigerian  troops had been serving in the peace keeping force since 1990  when the operation commenced.</p>

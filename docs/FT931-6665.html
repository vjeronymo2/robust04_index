			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Private View: A pastor at the grass roots - Fr Michael Conaty's parish is poor. He thinks poverty is a sin, but a sin the poor do not commit THE PARISH priest of St. Anthony's is a burly Irishman with a good golf handicap and 30 years' experience in the shipyards and housing estates of Newcastle upon Tyne. 'Poverty is a sin,' he said, 'but it is a sin that the poor do not commit.' Unemployment, crime and punishment have this week provoked a frenzy of analysis by British commentators following the arrest of two 10-year-old boys for the murder of a two-year-old child on Merseyside and the reappearance of a national jobless total of 3m. I went to look for someone who knew about such things at first hand and who carried no ideological brief. Fr Michael Conaty's views would be unpopular in London. The Left would object to his enthusiasm for self-help and traditional morals, the Right to his emphasis on compassion and forgiveness. But they are views with a weight of experience behind them. Fr Conaty is an activist, not an analyst. Around the church of St. Anthony of Padua in the district of Walker he has built, with donations and public money, a day care centre for the old, a youth club, training workshops, and plans an information office for job seekers. I asked him what he understood by 'the underclass'. 'Can I say straight away that this language is not in the vocabulary of the Church at all,' he replied. 'It's a judgment that society is making on one part of itself.' He prefers the word 'outcast' to describe those who have given up the struggle against a hostile system. 'But the marvellous thing about poor people is that they are all the time striving to be better.' Better off materially? 'Not so much materially. They are seeking a better quality of life. Poor people, by and large, are seeking education, they are seeking spiritual development. Apart from low income, how does poverty show itself? 'In an area like this, very, very deeply. There's a tremendous spiritual poverty. There is an emotional and psychological poverty. That's why you can't talk about the poor and the underclass in the same bracket. Poor people are probably driven into the underclass by what society is doing to them.' Last Sunday his parishioners prayed not only for the murdered child but for the two boys who were arrested. Because whoever committed that crime, Fr Conaty said, was as much sinned against as sinning. 'When we are sinned against we reach a stage when we cannot take any more; something within us explodes.' Aren't there too many people like you who see criminals as victims? John Major thinks society needs to 'condemn a little more and understand a little less'. Fr Conaty called the politicians' responses 'pathetic', and said: 'I do accept that murderers must be removed from society. But having removed them we have to look at what we are doing for them. There is an awful lot of self-righteousness going on. I find the harsh judgments that are made, the harsh statements in the media, very stark, lacking in compassion. We condemn the people rather than the crime itself.' The priest's Irish accent is unmarked by 35 years in the north-east of England; when he is emphatic his voice drops to a wheezy smoker's whisper. But when he made a disparaging reference to 'market forces' and I suggested that was code for a certain former prime minister, he burst out laughing and his broad face flushed red. He did not reply. Does poverty cause crime, or is crime a matter of choice? 'There's crime at the highest level of society.' He paused, mentioned a name, and, laughing again, asked me not to quote it. 'I'm making the simple point that poverty and crime are not linked at all.' Aren't they? 'Unfortunately poor people are driven to crime in order to survive. I'm speaking here of the ordinary things they do to each other, like stealing. But there's crimes at a level of society that are done deliberately for greed and nothing else.' But when your own car was stolen and burned out on the field there, that was not for survival. 'No, well, unfortunately the people who do that are rebelling. They are rebelling against those who have and it's a way of expressing the rebellion. It is a fact that they don't understand the difference between right and wrong.' Fr Conaty described taking a group of children to Lindisfarne where they collected dead birds and rats to bring home. They were fascinated by fire, death and killing, he said. I asked him why. 'I want to use the right words here. I wouldn't want to judge these children at all.' He paused a long time and said: 'These young people do not know what it is to be really loved. Because they are coming from backgrounds which have not got that capacity to really love. This is the spiritual poverty that's within. And while they might know that seeing blood, killing things, is wrong, they don't understand why it's wrong. They've got a very low self-esteem. And they suffer the pain of being the children of rejection. They are the children of rejection and they're moving into a society of rejection. One of the ways rejection shows itself is in destruction and violence of all sorts.' The collapse of discipline, of a moral sense, was due entirely to the collapse of family life, he said. An extreme example was society's willingness to let homosexual couples adopt children. And of course divorce had been made easy. 'What we have is the product of the permissive society of the 1960s.' He said liberation was a middle-class phenomenon that had been imposed on poorer people. 'People don't want those sort of changes. That's why Catholic schools are bursting at the seams. 'What we have become - and we're afraid to admit it - is a pagan society. We're no longer a Christian country.' Fr Conaty believes in the Devil. 'You cannot deny the reality of Satan and you would be blind not to recognise his influence. But it is unspoken about because people don't want to give him that glory.' Fr. Conaty maintains that British policymakers and administrators do not understand the problem of poverty. 'Because they have only one way of tackling it and that is through glorious handouts. More is needed: people must be given the freedom and the space must be opened for them to be able to help themselves.' Have the churches failed to understand the problem? 'I think in the last 30 years the social teaching of the churches has become tremendously aware of the poor. But you have the one-eyed god stuck in the corner day after day feeding people one gospel and we're trying to feed them another. So there's constant confusion and conflict.' If you had the power, what specifically would you do? 'I would take a thousand families in a poor area like this and I would give them complete ownership of the area, of their own problems. I would resource them financially, but I would take them out, broaden their horizons, try and help them to be creative with their own skills and talents and to work together as a community. The most important resource of those thousand families are not the houses or anything else  - it is the people. There is a solidarity among people in these situations. 'You see, everything that comes to them now is dictated from the top and it is all with terms and conditions. Any money that's given must make a political statement, must give glory to the system. 'I wouldn't be about changing their minds at all or changing their life styles. I'd be about changing their hearts.' Michael Conaty is 59, one of six children born to a farming couple in Cavan in the Irish Republic. His father died when the eldest child was still 12 and the family knew poverty. Another brother is a priest near Durham. He likes football and television news, takes the Guardian and Independent, reads spiritual essays and anything by Peter Ustinov. He has read the works of Mao Tse-tung and avidly follows developments in the ex-Communist bloc. His political hero is Willy Brandt, the former West German Chancellor. Perhaps people would say you are just a dyed-in-the- wool traditionalist Catholic priest. 'No, I'm not.' Do you preach hell-fire? 'No. I just love people and I preach the love of God.' His voice dropped. 'I have a tremendous awareness of the love of God and I share that with people. I'm not a man for rules and regulations. I pastor people in whatever circumstances they're in. I encourage them. I embrace them. 'You see, we're not doing things for people, we're helping them to be.' Later, he said. 'The priest is not a social worker. The social worker is about changing people's attitudes, their minds, supporting them at a very human level. But there is a spiritual need that all the time must be satisfied. You don't mean they want to go to Church every Sunday? 'No. The spiritual hunger is for someone to recognise them as they are.' Do you have a struggle with your religious faith? 'Where I struggle is that I get angry when I see what is happening to people here. I can get angry with God, angry with the Church, I get angry with the system. Because I see the destructive force that political systems are to people in this area. I have to come to terms with that in my own life.' An hour before, Fr Conaty had visited a field near the Swan Hunter shipyard used by children for motorbike scrambling. Residents approve; the police want it closed. He promised to help. I referred to this and said: a cynic would say 'Fr. Conaty is a good man but really he's just trying to net souls.' 'What I am is a fisher of people's hearts, you know. I'm not looking for anything from them. All the time I'm trying to give them what is good for them.' You're trying to get them the field, but you're trying to get them to heaven as well. 'No, I don't get them to heaven. That's God's job.'</p>

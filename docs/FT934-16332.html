			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / IMF reinstates Cambodia THE International Monetary Fund has reinstated Cambodia as a full member and approved a Dollars 9m (Pounds 5.9m) loan under its Systemic Transformation Facility, designed to help once centrally planned countries make the leap to a market economy. The decision follows pledges from donor countries gathered in Washington under the chairmanship of France and Japan to pay off Cambodia's Dollars 52m arrears to the IMF. Cambodia took advantage of last week's annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank in Washington to complete negotiations on a Dollars 62.7m emergency loan from the World Bank, intended to let the country finance essential imports. A World Bank mission is due next month to examine the need for infrastructure investment. But Cambodia's needs present unusual problems because of years of war. Reuter adds from Washington: The IMF announced yesterday it would lend Vietnam about Dollars 223m to help rebuild its economy. Last week Vietnam made itself eligible for new funding by paying off about Dollars 140m in IMF arrears for previous loans with the help of a group of wealthy donor countries, particularly France and Japan.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Presidential Aide Georgiy Saratov by </F> unidentified correspondent; place and date not given; from the  "Novosti" newscast -- recorded]    [Text] This week was marked not only by sackings, but by  appointments as well. Forty-six year old Georgiy Satarov was  given the post of presidential aide. He is a Muscovite, and he  graduated from the Moscow State Teachers Training College. He  worked there until 1991, studying the application of  mathematical methods to social sciences. After that he became  head of the Center of Applied Political Research, which he  himself had set up. Since 1993 he has been a member of the  Presidential Council. He is married, and has two daughters.    [Correspondent] First of all, Georgiy Aleksandrovich, allow  me to congratulate you on your appointment. But what made you  stop being a freelance and become an official?    [Satarov] Possibly it is a Joan of Arc type complex: Who if  not I? Because I know no other good reasons for a person with a  good academic career and a more or less successful life to  become a functionary. That is first. Second, there is, of  course an element of a sort of basic curiosity. It is one thing  to analyze and advise, and quite another thing to try and put  things into practice.    [Correspondent] You automatically cease being a member of  the  Presidential Council?    [Satarov] Yes.    [Correspondent] What will your responsibilities be?    [Satarov] They will encompass a range of political issues  connected with the interaction of the president with the Federal  Assembly and with parties and public bodies; the problem of his  constitutional powers in connection with the interaction between  society and authority; the building of a civic society, etc.    [Correspondent] The president is presently reorganizing his  staff, we all know this. Is the president trying to strengthen  his home front as he sees Chernomyrdin's team becoming stronger?.    [Satarov] That is not the case for the simple reason that  the  reorganization of the administration that is to take place in  the near future, as well as the new appointments that were made  just now, mine included, were planned a very long time ago, even  before the start of the elections.    [Correspondent] When the government is criticized do people  criticize the president as well?    [Satarov] Yes and no. At present there is a certain  distancing, of course. In particular, this is also connected  with the constitution, this new system of powers. On the other  hand, the president is responsible for the Cabinet, because the  prime minister was chosen by him. So he cannot avoid  responsibility completely, and it is clear that any criticism of  the government also reflects upon the president, there can be no  doubt about that.</p>

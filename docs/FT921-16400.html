			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Kwik-Fit fitter as it shrugs off report on poor service KWIK-FIT Holdings, the Edinburgh-based tyre and exhaust systems replacement group, yesterday shrugged off sharp criticism from a Consumers' Association report on 'fast fit' servicing centres. The share price fell 7p at the start of trading yesterday as reports of the criticism circulated. By the close, however, the price was unchanged at 182p. Motor industry analysts, some of whom were critical of the manner in which the Association's research was conducted, also suggested the report was unlikely to cause lasting damage. Kwik-Fit - slogan 'you can't get better than a Kwik-Fit fitter' - was lambasted in Which?, the association's magazine. It said that more than a quarter of 43 Kwik-Fit branches surveyed had recommended unnecessary work on a car taken in to have its 'basically sound' exhaust inspected. One other 'fast-fit' group, the north-west of England-based Smileys, was rated 'poor' in the survey. Among eight others surveyed, Michelin-owned ATS was rated 'good' while Continental-owned National and Goodyear-owned Tyreservices were rated 'average'. Market sentiment about the group's present financial prospects was that increased vehicle tyre sales arising from new minimum tread depth standards (introduced on January 1) would more than compensate for any adverse effects of the Consumers' Association report, which focused mainly on exhaust system replacement. Mr Tony Lancelott, Phillips and Drew motor industry analyst, said: 'One should be cautious about drawing too many conclusions about the likely impact of the report'. Kwik-Fit profits increased 67 per cent to Pounds 16.8m in the first half of 1991. Mr Tom Farmer, chairman, has said that 'we had a good six months last year and there is no reason to believe that we will not have a good six months this year.' Debt fell from Pounds 20m at the year-end to Pounds 15m.</p>

			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Leading Article: European defence The French prime minister called yesterday for improved co-operation on defence, including weapons development, between members of the European Union. His words are given added point by last week's Dollars 10bn merger between Lockheed and Martin Marietta - the most spectacular illustration to date of the way that plunging military budgets are altering the structure of the US defence industry, and a reminder that Europe's arms producers are far behind. The European defence sector is not dormant. British Aerospace and Matra are still negotiating a merger of their missile activities; Aerospatiale of France and Deutsche Aerospace have pledged to merge theirs, and possibly also their satellite businesses, by next year. But the continent's defence industry remains overcrowded, and every new American merger brings closer the day when European weapons are priced out of all markets (including European ones) by rivals from across the Atlantic. No single European country can hope to be self-sufficient in defence technology. Yet European governments are setting tough conditions for transnational mergers, ostensibly to avoid compromising national secrets or creating dependence on foreign governments. This attitude is hardly consistent with the commitment to a common foreign and security policy, and eventual common defence policy, enshrined in the Maastricht treaty. It appears that the collapse of the Soviet threat, even as it renders the economics of cross-border defence co-operation more compelling, has, by depriving European states of a common enemy, made them more nationalistic in their defence philosophy. Experiences like that of Eurofighter 2000 have made governments rightly sceptical about the value of cross-border collaborative programmes in producing defence equipment efficiently. If a coherent and competitive European defence industry is to come about, it must be in response to an integrated defence market. By co-operating over the purchase of big weapons, and throwing open their purchase of smaller ones to the most competitive European bidder, governments could create the circumstances under which it would be easier for arms makers to merge. Article 223 of the Treaty of Rome, which effectively puts military products outside the scope of the common market, is now clearly an anachronism and should logically have been repealed when the Maastricht treaty was adopted. In an ideal world, indeed, this logic would apply to the Atlantic alliance as a whole. But experience suggests that US defence industries will continue to use arguments of national security, however spurious, to prevent the introduction of a genuine 'two-way street' in weapons procurement across the Atlantic. The best Europe can hope, therefore, is to ensure that on its side such arguments are applied to Europe as a whole, rather than at the level of individual states, which are far too small to achieve the necessary economies of scale. There should be no question of excluding American products, but the burden of proof must fall on those defence ministries that wish to buy American where there is a competitive European alternative. This is a point the British government should weigh carefully before choosing Lockheed in preference to the proposed new European military transport aircraft, in which British industry could play an important part.</p>

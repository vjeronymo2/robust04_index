These committal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measures have the potential to deliver approximately 83 tons per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> day of VOC. Scheduled SCAQMD rule development could also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contribute substantial additional NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  reductions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In preparing the November 1994 ozone attainment plan, CARB,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SCAQMD, and SCAG are now reassessing strategies for adopting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measures to reduce NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and VOC emissions. The SCAQMD is also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developing a VOC RECLAIM program for near-term adoption and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For purposes of this attainment demonstration, however, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is not assigning emission reduction credit to measures until they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are fully adopted in enforceable form. EPA urges the responsible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State and local agencies to complete rule development and submit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rules for SIP approval as soon as they are fully adopted. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will allow EPA to approve the regulations and substitute the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> locally developed measures for FIP rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> FIP Rules. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The set of FIP measures proposed for implementation in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> South Coast relies largely on those regulations discussed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section III.B as elements common to all three FIP areas. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> includes the controls for onroad and nonroad mobile sources,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplemented by such elements as I/M and sticker programs. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, the proposed FIP for the South Coast includes the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mobile source controls discussed in the Ventura FIP summary, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> two measures peculiar to the South Coast FIP: A fee-based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program to reduce emissions from ports and a locomotive cap rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For stationary and area sources, it includes regulations for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service stations, livestock waste, fugitive emission controls for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> petroleum and chemical facilities, and waste burning, as well as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the statewide measures and the emission cap program. Finally,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the South Coast FIP relies on the new technology commitments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussed immediately below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 182(e)(5) provisions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1) Statutory provision and General Preamble requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 182(e)(5) of the Clean Air Act applies exclusively  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to ``Extreme'' ozone areas (i.e., only the South Coast area). This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision authorizes the State (or EPA, standing in the shoes of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the State <FOOTCITE>30</FOOTCITE> ) to rely for its ozone attainment demonstration on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conceptual, as yet unadopted measures that anticipate new or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> improved technology. The South Coast's 1991 Air Quality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Management Plan employs a similar approach in its ``Tier II'' and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Tier III'' new technology measures, which consist of brief  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussions of control targets (percentage and emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reductions) for specific or general source categories, to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achieved in future years through technological advances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 30 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed above, the Ninth Circuit has held that ``Acting in place of the State of Arizona pursuant to a FIP under 42 U.S.C. &sect;7410(c), EPA `stands in the shoes of the defaulting State, and all of the rights and duties that would otherwise fall to the State accrue instead to EPA.'''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Central Arizona Water Conservation District et al. v. EPA, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  990 F.2d 1531, 1541 (9th Cir. 1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For EPA to credit such measures toward the ozone attainment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstration (either by SIP approval or FIP promulgation), EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must find that the measures are not needed to meet the Act's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> progress requirements for the first 10 years (see section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 182(e)(5)(A)), and EPA must approve State commitments or make its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> own commitments to submit contingency measures no later than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> three years before proposed implementation of the measures,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sufficient to ensure the required rate of progress and attainment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (section 182(e)(5)(B)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's General Preamble for the Implementation of Title I  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provides the Agency's preliminary articulation of how it will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exercise its considerable discretion under section 182(e)(5). At  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this time, EPA, in approving or promulgating measures under this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section, will look to see that the plan shows that the measures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cannot be fully developed and adopted by the submittal date for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the attainment demonstration; that the plan contains a schedule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outlining the steps leading to final development and adoption of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the measures; and that the plan contains commitments from those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies that would be involved in developing and implementing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the schedule for each measure (57 FR 13524, April 16, 1992).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the Act's requirement that the technology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advancement measures not be needed to achieve progress required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during the first 10 years, EPA believes that the Administrator  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should satisfy herself with respect to three separate progress  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements applicable during the 10-year period following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enactment of the 1990 Amendments to the Act: (1) 15 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduction of VOC emissions for the 6-year period from 1990 to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1996, as required by section 182(b)(1); (2) 9 percent reduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of VOC and/or NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions for the 3-year period from 1997 to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1999, as required by section 182(c)(2)(B); and (3) a further 3  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent reduction of VOC and/or NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions during the year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2000, as the initial installment of the 9 percent reductions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required for the period 2000 to 2002. <FOOTCITE>31</FOOTCITE>  In section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> III.B.5.d.(4) of this NPRM, EPA demonstrates that each of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> three progress requirements is satisfied (with regard to section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 182(e)(5)) by the combination of State and local measures and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FIP regulations proposed in this NPRM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 31 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> EPA policies on rate-of-progress plan requirements, including substitution of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  for VOC emissions reductions for the post-1996 period, appear in two recent guidance documents:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Guidance for Growth Factors, Projections, and Control Strategies for the 15 Percent Rate-of-Progress Plans <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  (EPA&hyph;452/R&hyph;93&hyph;002, March 1993); and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Guidance on the Post-1996 Rate-of-Progress Plan and the Attainment Demonstration. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2) Need for additional time to develop new technologies in enacting special provisions for ozone attainment in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> South Coast, Congress recognized that attainment in this area may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require 20 years, even on an expeditious schedule of progress.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The difficulty of the ozone attainment project derives primarily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the topography and climate of the South Coast basin, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combine to produce ideal conditions for the formation and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> persistence of tropospheric ozone. In this setting exists one of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the world's largest industrial and commercial centers, with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> population projected to approach 18 million by the attainment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The technological challenge of attainment is evident in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extraordinary remaining ozone precursor reduction requirements_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximately 90% for VOC and 70% for NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _which are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> superimposed on an already very strict level of existing control.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Complete elimination of all emissions from motor vehicles would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not accomplish even half of the needed reductions. In fact, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> South Coast could not reach attainment even if there were no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mobile source and industrial emissions in the basin. The area's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unique reduction responsibilities therefore necessitate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> breakthroughs in air pollution control technologies for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practically every pollution source, coupled with the most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advanced techniques and initiatives for preventing pollution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes that the pace of air pollution control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technology development in the past provides a reasonable basis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for confidence that the South Coast can meet the Clean Air Act's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2010 ozone attainment goal using section 182(e)(5). Lacking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sufficiently detailed data to predict and mandate specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controls for each particular source category, however, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposes to employ section 182(e)(5) commitments to extend the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rate of progress beyond the levels now foreseeable and reflected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the declining cap rules discussed above. EPA also proposes to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commit to achieving additional reductions from smaller stationary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> source categories than are covered under the proposed cap rules,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as well as from area and mobile sources. The commitments would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allow EPA, the State, and the affected sources sufficient time to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cooperate in the further development and commercialization of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control approaches to deliver the remaining reductions needed for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attainment. EPA strongly encourages CARB and SCAQMD to devote  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their substantial resources to expediting development and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adoption of State and local controls in advance of the section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 182(e)(5) commitment dates for rule adoption and implementation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (3) Federal Role in Support of Technological Development Activities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Scope of EPA's Responsibilities. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  From its inception, EPA has been charged with a leadership  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> role in coordinating, assisting, and independently advancing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> national research efforts to develop methods and technologies for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> air pollution control.

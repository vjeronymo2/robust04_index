			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Customers back 'green' efforts by Welsh Water THREE QUARTERS of Welsh Water customers believe it is unacceptable that fewer than half of the households in the principality are connected to full sewage treatment systems, the company said yesterday. Welsh Water yesterday published the results of a Pounds 1.2m consultation exercise which it claims is the most comprehensive survey since Ofwat, the industry regulator, told the privatised companies last year to consult customers on their investment plans. More than 184,000 customers - 15 per cent of the total - returned questionnaires and more than 2,000 were interviewed by market research company Mori, allowing Welsh Water to draw conclusions on customer priorities. The overall message was that high standards for drinking-water quality should be maintained and increases in bills should be kept at low as possible. But most customers wanted priority to be given to environmental improvements, for which they were prepared to pay at least Pounds 5 a year more on their bills. Mr Nigel Annett, director of quality and planning for Dwr Cymru, the company's water and sewerage division, said: 'We have a very long coastline and since Victorian times a lot of sewage has been simply flushed into the sea without any treatment whatsoever. That is no longer acceptable. So we have an enormous challenge ahead to sort that out.' Welsh Water will now put to Ofwat a Pounds 1bn investment plan for 1995 to 2000. Two thirds of the money will be spent on environmental improvements, with annual bill increases of 2 percentage points above inflation, equivalent to Pounds 5 a year on the average domestic bill. Bills averaged Pounds 213 last year, the third-highest of any privatised water company. Adoption of the plan will mean an increase to 90 per cent by the year 2000 of full treatment of sewage, completion of projects to enable all 51 designated coastal bathing waters in Wales to reach EC standards, and replacement of half the existing lead pipes. Just over half of the customers questioned said they were satisfied with overall value for money but only a third of business customers were. Businesses were less willing than householders to pay more for coastal and river protection. 'Companies are obviously very concerned about any cost rising,' Mr Annett said. 'What we were surprised to find was that there was a willingness by them to pay for environmental improvement - not a great willingness to pay but it is there.' The survey showed that customers want a better basis for water charges. But Welsh Water rejects universal metering because water is abundant in the principality and the cost would be 'spectacular'.</p>

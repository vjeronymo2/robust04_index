			<p>BFN     [Text] Aid organizations say a quarter of Zimbabwe's  population in remote rural districts is facing food shortages,  two years after surviving one of the worst droughts in its  history. The organizations say although Zimbabwe has surplus  food in reserve, the country's southern areas were running  desperately short.    The provincial administrator for Zimbabwe's southern  Masvingo  Province, Mr. Alphonse Chikurira, said some districts had never  recovered fully from the devastating drought. Mr. Chikurira  said 20 percent of the 2,100,000 people in Zimbabwe's Masvimgo  Province had registered for drought relief this year, compared  with about 80 percent during the 1992 drought.    Officials estimated that about $18.5 million would be  required this year to buy food for the needy in Masvingo,  southwestern Matabeleland, and eastern Manicaland Provinces.</p>

The good tendency of agriculture to develop towards an  export orientation has improved the objective and subjective  situation for starting an export oriented agriculture in  Heilongjiang. However, we must understand clearly that there is  still a considerable gap compared with more advanced provinces  or regions in export oriented agriculture, regardless of whether  one means breadth or depth.    Major problems demanding conscious resolution are:    1. The current system is unsuitable. It lacks strong  organization and leadership, and the responsibilities of  departments in charge are unclear. Coordination is weak, so  there is no joining forces. In many places, export oriented  agriculture is in a state of self-development. Looking at the  foreign trade system, state controls are too tight for  Heilongjiang's exports of agricultural by-products; some  backbone export products remain strictly controlled by an export  plan, which dampens enthusiasm for earning foreign currency from  exports. For export of some agricultural by-products, there  exist such problems as complicated procedures, many official  procedures, lack of price transparency, somewhat unreasonable  profit sharing, etc. This has forced some agricultural  by-products into export channels in other provinces. For  example: hua [3323] mushrooms produced in Yanshou County have to  be exported through Hainan's foreign trade department. The  Shuangcheng Furfural Plant exports furfural through the foreign  trade department at 5,700 yuan per ton, but the plant can only  get 3,600 yuan; the profit distribution is very unreasonable.    2. Processing and circulation is still the weak link.  Although the integration of trade, industry, and agriculture,  and the merging of production, processing, and marketing have  brought about rapid development from a quantity standpoint,  there has not really been much done when it comes to developing  an export oriented agriculture, and for leading enterprises like  the Shuangcheng Nestle Corporation, Ltd, the results have been  even fewer. Many of our leading enterprises are low quality and  low level, their products having no market competitiveness, so  that the majority of the agricultural by-products we have for  export are raw materials. Statistics from the Farm  Administrative General Bureau of Heilongjiang, primary products  occupy over 90 percent of the annual exports of agricultural  by-products, and more than 80 percent for the entire province. A  lack of leading enterprises has made some bases very unstable.  Some cattle bases are in decline, to the depression of dairy  product plants and delays in payment for milk expenditures. In  Bing County and Wuchang, there is large-scale raising of beef  cattle, but so far there has not been a thorough processing  enterprise.    3. The infrastructure is poor. The current shortage of  railway and road transport is a serious obstacle to the  development of foreign trade. In some border ports which cannot  be reached by rail, poor roads makes import and export of goods  erratic, seriously countering these ports' advantages.  Telecommunications facilities are backward in many areas, which  affects shipping information, and restricts commodity  circulation and economic development.    4. A shortage of intelligence. After some remote areas  became  open ports, the quality of personnel in these areas just did not  measure up. There is a lack of foreign trade administrators and  foreign language talent.    5. Policies have not been implemented completely. There are  many official procedures, many complicated steps, and farmers  have to obtain licenses to go to the market. Heilongjiang's Farm  Administrative General Bureau complain that farms cannot share  favorite policies of their localities. People also complain that  current economic laws and regulations, especially those  involving foreign affairs, are imperfect. In addition, there is  a lack of arbitration, making foreign trade disputes difficult  to resolve promptly.    Looking at the experiences of Heilongjiang's advanced models  or that of other provinces, in order to develop export oriented  agriculture, Heilongjiang must insist on being led by big  international and domestic markets, and make further adjustments  in its agricultural mix. Second, it must be vigorous in its  operation of export oriented agricultural by-product processing  enterprises. Primary agricultural products do not suit the  international market well, nor the requirements of the growing  domestic market; in intense market competition, economic  efficiency is just as hard to attain. In those places in  Shandong and Dalian which have been successful at export  oriented agriculture, all breakthroughs were first made by  leading enterprises. The great and lasting development of  Shuangcheng cattle production in Heilongjiang relies chiefly on  such export oriented leading enterprises as the Nestle  Corporation, Ltd. These processing enterprises have not only  opened up export channels for foreign trade, they have also  provided the impetus for local agricultural by-products  production. Third, we must vigorously develop bases for  commodity production. Establishing well-known, excellent, and  exceptional bases for the production of agricultural by-products  is a precondition of guaranteeing commodity quality, variety,  and wholesale supply. So, we must change our scattered,  single-family operations into a concentrated, linked, production  base having "one trade in one village", "one product in one  village", carrying out systematic production, processing, and  marketing, integrating trade, industry, and agriculture. These  bases should have professional organizations offering full  services, including information, production, processing,  storage, shipping, and sales. Fourth, we must vigorously absorb  capital and technology from other provinces and countries.  Bringing in capital and technology from other provinces and  countries is a shortcut to developing export oriented  agriculture. Not only will this solve the problem of a shortage  of capital in the start-up phase, it may also arrange and  implement the product market while bringing in capital.    Developing export oriented agriculture is a massive  systematic project. We should organize professional teams to  acquire information from the domestic and international markets.  We should both know the current market demand situation and  master developing and changing trends in the future. We must  reduce export restrictions on agricultural by-products, release  a part of the inspection and approval rights to localities, and  especially should relax policies on grain exports. The  provincial government should release certain exporting rights  for agricultural by-products to localities, enterprises, and  enterprise groups.</p>

			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Crime and punishment LAW AND order is one of the themes the Conservative party has chosen to highlight at this year's annual conference in Blackpool. Traditionally, the electorate has seen the Conservatives as the party which is toughest on crime and criminals. But Mr Tony Blair, Labour's home affairs spokesman, has been skilfully exploiting the government's failure to halt the rise in crime. The prime minister is keen to win back the initiative. Much, therefore, is expected of Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, who will reply to the conference debate on law and order later today. The record he must defend is not impressive. Since 1979 the number of crimes reported has doubled while the clear-up rate, the proportion of crimes solved, has fallen from 41 per cent to 26 per cent. Confidence in the criminal justice system is low, according to the opinion polls. Yet the UK continues to send a higher proportion of the populace to prison than almost any other country in the Council of Europe. The mood among constituency representatives is likely to be in favour of stronger measures to fight crime. Mr Howard may be tempted - like some of his predecessors - to announce high-profile initiatives that appear to address current concerns. Juvenile offenders who are out of parental control can expect harsh words. So can persistent offenders who are undeterred by repeated police cautions when they are caught. Overburdened courts But the home secretary would be wise to recall the fate of earlier nostrums such as the Dangerous Dogs Act and the Aggravated Vehicle Taking Act. The former has added greatly to the burden of the courts, while the latter has done little to stop joy-riding or the death and injury associated with it. The failure of such well-publicised measures further erodes public confidence in the ability of the system to curb crime. It would be much better for Mr Howard to address his bulging in-tray which is full of well-considered plans for reforming the system. At the top of the pile is the report from Sir Patrick Sheehy on police pay and conditions. This contains a plethora of suggestions for rooting out restrictive practices in the police service and improving its performance. The report has produced a ferocious campaign of resistance among the police staff associations, sundering the close relationship the Conservative government has enjoyed with the police since 1979. Ensuring that its main thrust is achieved without forfeiting police goodwill will require all Mr Howard's skill and finesse. Prison service Also needing care and attention is the government's programme for modernising the prison service. The creation of a competitive private sector in prison management offers the prospect of improvements in the prison regime and lower costs for the exchequer. But a sudden surge in prison numbers could lead to overcrowding which would undermine both objectives. The cost of a conference promise to send more convicted criminals to prison and to make their life harsher could be expensive indeed. Finally, Mr Howard must make his mind up on the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice, where he faces apparently contradictory pressures. On the one hand, he needs to re-establish confidence in a system damaged by a series of miscarriages of justice. That suggests steps that might make it harder for convictions to be obtained. On the other hand, he must deal with concern over the failure of the system to punish those who are palpably guilty. That suggests making convictions easier to obtain. In practice, the chances of conviction are best improved by making miscarriages less likely to happen. Juries that have no confidence in the fairness of the criminal justice system will be reluctant to convict. The flow of information upon which crime solving depends also relies on improving the relationship between the police and the public. Low-key measures to achieve these aims may not win conference acclaim, but they offer the best chance of making an impact on crime levels by the next election. Restoring the effectiveness of the criminal justice system requires a long-term strategy rather than quick fixes.</p>

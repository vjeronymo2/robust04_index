			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / Economics Notebook: The challenge facing Asia's growth cycle If Japan sneezes, will Asia catch a cold? The question arises because recent years have seen increasing investment by Japanese companies in production capacity in other Asian countries, and a sharp rise in trade in the region. Economists talk of Asian economic growth being self-generating, with rapid development fostering markets for Asian-produced goods within Asia. This would make the area less vulnerable to cyclical swings elsewhere in the world. The fast-growing countries of the region - the four newly industrialising economies and their aspiring rivals in south east Asia - have proved fairly resilient to the recession in the US, upon which they once depended for export markets. However, a severe slowdown in Japan, the region's largest and most developed economy, could engender fears the whole process of Asian development might be undermined. Many Japanese companies suffering unprecedented pressures on profits - like Sony which last week forecast an operating loss for its current financial year - have transplanted much of their production to countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. Japanese electronics companies have set up about 600 plants in the Asia/Pacific region outside Japan. Asia's remarkable development is stratified: Japan's factories develop and produce the newest, highest technology goods. These become standard products. Switching manufacture abroad leaves home plants to turn to the next stage of technology. In recent years, not only Japanese but also Korean, Taiwanese, Singaporean and Hong Kong companies have invested substantially in this manner. In theory, this should result in significant transfer of technology and management skills, though evidence of this occurring seems questionable. If it were, it would help provide a base for self-sustaining development in countries receiving investment. It should also increase 'layering' of development as, for example, Thai industry in turn farms out production to Vietnam. The process depends on constant development of new technology in the countries originating investment, especially Japan. Here, views are divided about the future. Though Japan is looking ahead to new products such as high definition television and mini-compact discs there are some doubts about whether these will have blockbuster impact. On the other hand, production and sales of electronic consumer goods are high and markets are growing, especially in Asia. The market for lower value-added products such as refrigerators and air conditioners could continue to expand as markets like China and India open up. So the prospects for the new industries of south east Asia may remain healthy. For some economists, a sign that growth will feed on itself is the development of sub-zones, each including a technical, financial and marketing services base and an area of cheaper labour. Prof Edward Chen, director of the Centre of Asian Studies at Hong Kong University, sees five such zones developing: South China zone, centred on Hong Kong and including four southern provinces of mainland China and Taiwan; Yellow Sea zone, including South and North Korea and north east China; Japan Sea zone, which adds Japan and Asiatic Russia to the Yellow Sea zone; 'Greater Indochina' zone, centred on Thailand and including the Yunnan province of China, the three Indochina countries and Burma; The 'growth triangle' of Singapore, the Malaysian state of Johore and Indonesia's Batam island. The last of these is being fostered by government impetus. The others are developing mainly through private sector initiative and, as can be seen, circumventing political barriers. The most striking and well developed is the South China zone. Hong Kong industrialists estimate there are 25,000 factories in Guangdong province either owned by or sub-contracting for Hong Kong manufacturers. They employ 3m Chinese workers. Though this creates the prospect of endogenous growth within Asia, the reality is that the mainstay of development is export of manufactured goods to the developed world. Mr Quek Peck Lim, head of research at Morgan Grenfell Asia Securities in Singapore, says: 'The last 10 years have underwritten some degree of growth over and above vulnerability to the OECD countries.' A major economic shock in the west would not cause a collapse in most Asian economies as it would have done 20 years ago, he says. For the foreseeable future, however, access to western markets remains crucial, which is why Asia views anxiously European integration and the north American free trade agreement. Its most effective response to these will be a continuing drive to export goods as competitively as possible. Attempts at trade agreements within Asia have not got far because, in spite of the development of the cross-border zones, Asian countries mainly compete with each other for markets outside the region and do not want to risk upsetting customers. The recent accord between south east Asian nations may, however, have some importance as intra-regional trade grows. The sluggish economies of the US and Germany, more than that of Japan, lead forecasters to predict slower growth for most Asian economies this year. Ms Sarah Hewin, senior economist at American Express Bank in London, is predicting an average of between 4 per cent and 6 per cent growth for the NIEs and south east Asian countries compared with between 6 per cent and 8 per cent for 1991 - though this masks significant divergences and special factors. Indonesia and South Korea are still wrestling with inflation and other overheating problems, while Hong Kong and Taiwan will be boosted by big spending on infrastructure. Nevertheless, the region remains extraordinarily dynamic. Economic reforms in China - and in the hitherto insulated south Asian countries particularly India - suggest further rapid growth, increasingly generated within the region. Asian governments need to ensure investment and trade climates continue to improve, that overheating is kept in check, and strains on infrastructure are eased and anticipated.</p>

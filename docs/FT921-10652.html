			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Hungarian fund permits foreign investors A NEW Hungarian, forint-denominated fund will for the first time give foreigners the right to invest in debt instruments issued by the Hungarian government The fund, which will be launched later this month by Creditanstalt Securities, Budapest, and which will last five years, offers 100,000 units of 10,000 shares worth Ft1bn (Dollars 13.5m) Mr Csaba von Csiky, a senior member of Creditanstalt Securities in Budapest, yesterday said he expected country funds, high-yield funds and private investors to subscribe. 'I think we can expect a 35 per cent return on this investment. Hungarian government debt instruments yielded between 31 per cent and 37 per cent in 1991,' he added. The launch of the fund follows a change in Hungarian legislation last November, which came into effect on January 1. Although foreign investors will continue to be prevented from buying Hungarian government debt securities directly, they can invest indirectly through an investment fund. Investors will be allowed to transfer dividends and any proceeds, or dispose of units in the fund in the currency in which they originally invested, Mr von Csiky said. The fund, which will consist of government Treasury bonds, notes or bills, is expected to be listed on the Budapest Stock Exchange and the third tier of the Vienna and Stuggart exchanges. The launch of the fund coincides with attempts by the Hungarian government to reduce the annual rate of inflation from 35 per cent in 1991 to 20 per cent this year. Mr von Csiky pointed to the government's consistent policy of not seeking rescheduling, or any debt relief on its net hard currency debt of Dollars 20bn.</p>

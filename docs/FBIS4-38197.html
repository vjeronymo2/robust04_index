			<p>BFN     [Text] The prime minister left New Delhi this afternoon for  Moscow on a four-day official visit. Mr. Narasimha Rao was seen  off at the Delhi airport by several union ministers, the three  service chiefs, and senior officials, among others. Mr. Rao is  heading a high-level delegation and will have wide-ranging talks  with the Russian president, Mr. Yeltsin, and other leaders.    Our correspondent, Kajal Das, accompanying the prime  minister, reports that bilateral trade which witnessed a slump  in recent years will get a boost from this visit. Russia has  already offered to set up joint ventures out of the Rupee-Ruble  Repayment Fund. The high-level delegation accompanying Mr.  Narasima Rao includes union ministers Mr. Pranab Mukherjee, Mr.  Ghulam Nabi Azad, Mr. R.L. Bhatia, and Mr. Bhubanesh Chaturvedi,  and defense and foreign secretaries.</p>

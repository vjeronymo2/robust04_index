			<p><P> October 30, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ON THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> JIMMY CARSON MAY BE TRADED AGAIN -- THIS TIME TO RED WINGS  </P> <P> Edmonton's Jimmy Carson -- the Los Angeles Kings player who was traded, along  with $15 million -- for Wayne Gretzky, may be dealt again, this time to the  Detroit Red Wings, a newspaper reported today.  </P> <P> The clubs are close to a trade that would send Carson and another Oilers player  to Detroit in exchange for Petr Klima, Joe Murphy and Adam Graves, the Detroit  Free Press reported in today's editions.  </P> <P> The newspaper said it learned of the deal from two sources it did not name, one  with the Red Wings and one close to Carson, 21, whose family lives in a Detroit  suburb.  </P> <P> The Red Wings had no comment on the report, spokesman Bill Jamieson said this  morning.  </P> <P> "Whatever happens, happens," said Carson, who walked out on the Oilers two  weeks ago after demanding to be traded. He had a goal and two assists in four  games this season with Edmonton and had 49 goals and 51 assists last season,  his first with the Oilers after a trade that sent Gretzky, the NHL's all-time  scoring leader, to the Kings.  </P> <P> Klima said he will refuse to report to Edmonton if traded there.  </P></p>

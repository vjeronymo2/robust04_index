			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Delors condemns EC for lack of resolve MR Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, yesterday accused the 12 EC members of a dangerous lack of resolve in their action over the crisis in Bosnia-Hercegovina. In a passionate speech to an emergency meeting of MEPs, Mr Delors called for 'realistic military intervention' in the former Yugoslav republic to prevent the 'cunning and murderous strategy of the Serb leaders' spreading through the Balkans. MEPs added their voices to the attack on member governments by fiercely criticising Britain, which holds the EC presidency, for not taking firmer action. 'Can the 12 agree to develop a credible military response to demonstrate our resolve, even if we don't have to use it, or will the 12 remain at sixes and sevens? Will we see the same sort of disagreement that has started to spring up around the treaty on European union?' asked Mr Delors, in an unscripted dig at the EC partners' disarray over the Maastricht treaty. Mr Delors outlined a six-point plan to help relieve the suffering of Bosnian refugees and prisoners. The Commission proposals include: International supervision of detention camps. A safe corridor for the delivery of humanitarian aid - protected by military forces, if necessary. Aid to ex-Yugoslav republics looking after refugees. Temporary shelter for refugees in other European countries. Reinforcement of the embargo on trade with Serbia. Step up diplomatic action to ensure protection of human rights. Mr Abel Matutes, the EC commissioner responsible for the region, said he was particularly worried that the embargo was being broken along the shores of the Danube and Black Sea. He called for armed inspectors to control imports to Serbia. Mr Douglas Hogg, the UK's junior foreign office minister, met Mr Delors, Mr Matutes and European deputies in Brussels yesterday to prepare for the London peace conference to be held at the end of this month. He later flew to Moscow, where he will meet government officials before flying on to Prague on Wednesday and Belgrade on Thursday. He missed yesterday's European parliament meeting, where a number of deputies attacked the presidency. Mr Jean-Pierre Cot, leader of the socialist group, the largest in the parliament, asked whether Britain was up to the task of handling the Yugoslav crisis. Mr Willem van Velzen, a Dutch socialist, said discussions with Mr Hogg had been 'extremely disappointing'. 'I'm more concerned about the victims of this conflict, but the presidency seemed more worried about the aggressors,' he claimed. MEPs also heard from representatives of the UN High Commission for Refugees and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Mr Paul Grossrieder, of the ICRC, said his organisation was trying to maintain an objective view of the crisis, and would not make any formal statement on the detention camps until it had visited them all. He said calls for the ICRC to supervise the camps 'do not take account of the fact that our organisation is not made up of prison wardens'.</p>

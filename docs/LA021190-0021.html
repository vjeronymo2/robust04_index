			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONE MAN'S EXPERIENCE STRIKES FAMILIAR CHORD  </P> <P> Bruce Bean's article was well done and raises our sympathy. We all must agree  that the Stuart case in Boston was in great error, but when the seeming victim  of a violent double crime describes his assailant, the authorities cannot be  blamed for searching for the person so described.  </P> <P> For most of my adult life I have been giving to Southern Christian Leadership  Conference, Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, the Urban League,  Southern Poverty Law Center. The last time I had an unusual kindness done me by  an Afro-American male was 25 years ago. Since then I have had two cars stolen  and recovered in black areas after having been stripped and vandalized. I have  been mugged and robbed by blacks. I have been robbed at gunpoint once by an  Afro-American who said, "You and your kind have been taking from me my whole  life. Now I'm taking from you." Another time I escaped two robbers.  </P> <P> I give everyone "common courtesy and respect" but am tired of being a victim.  </P> <P> JOHN D. ANDREWS, Palos Verdes Peninsula  </P></p>

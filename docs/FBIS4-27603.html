			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 1 (YONHAP) -- South Korea's net foreign  debt has surged this year due to the rising trade deficit and a  reduction in the flow of foreign capital into the domestic stock  market, according to the Bank of Korea [BOK].    The country's net foreign debt, tallied by excluding  overseas  assets from the total foreign debt, jumped to 8.7 billion  dollars at the end of March from 7.87 billion dollars at the end  of last year, a BOK report said Wednesday.    The report said the total foreign debt had increased 1.21  billion dollars to 45.08 billion dollars as of March from 43.87  billion dollars at last year's end, while the value of overseas  assets rose just 380 million dollars from 36 billion dollars to  36.38 billion dollars during the same period.    The net foreign debt dropped to 10 billion dollars last  August from 11.1 billion dollars at the end of 1992, falling  further to 7.71 billion dollars last November before starting to  increase slightly afterwards. The upward trend has continued  this year.    The surge was due to the widening trade deficit, which hit  2,524 million dollars during the first quarter this year, the  drastic reduction of foreign investment in the domestic stock  market and the increase in short-term foreign debt, according to  the report.    The amount of long-term debt with a repayment term of more  than one year fell to 24.57 billion dollars as of the end of  March from 24.71 billion dollars at last year-end, while the  short-term debt with a repayment period of less than one year  increased 1.35 billion dollars to 20.51 billion dollars from  19.16 billion dollars during the same period, indicating the  country's aggravated foreign debt structure, the report said.    The long-term debt decreased due to a government policy of  curbing the introduction of long-term foreign loans for fear of  a flood of incoming foreign money including stock investment  capital, experts say.    The increase in short-term debt, meanwhile, can be explained  by the government's efforts to ease various restrictions on  foreign trade financing, including extension of the credit  purchase period to 120 days from the previous 90 days starting  Jan. 1, they say.</p>

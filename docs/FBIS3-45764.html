The purpose of this meeting, which was sponsored by  the provincial government, was to implement the spirit of the  Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the  national economic work meeting and to arrange economic work in  the province this year. Provincial party and government leaders  including Yin Kesheng [provincial party secretary], Tian  Chengping [provincial governor], Cai Zhulin, Wang Hanmin  [provincial vice governor], Huanjue Cenam, Ma Yuanbiao, La  Bingli, Liu Guanghe, as well as people in charge of the relevant  prefectural, city, and provincial government departments.    At the meeting, Wang Hanmin relayed the instructions of the  national economic work meeting. Tian Chengping made a speech on  how to make a success of this year's economic work.    In his speech, Governor Tian Chengping pointed out: Last  year Qinghai basically maintained speedy and healthy economic  development. The province's GNP and gross industrial and  agricultural output value topped 10 billion yuan. In line with  the policy of high quality, high yield, and high efficiency in  agriculture, we adjusted its internal composition and gained  good results. In industrial production, we freed ourselves from  old practices and materialized speedy and healthy development.  Investment in fixed assets and local revenue increased. All  these have provided favorable conditions for this year's  economic work.    Governor Tian Chengping continued: There are still many  problems and difficulties in the province's economic work and  these are restricting the province's normal economic operation.  Therefore, in this new year, we must correctly seize the  opportunity, take advantage of our favorable conditions,  overcome our difficulties, and promote the province's economic  work.    Governor Tian Chengping raised the following ideas for this  year's economic work: Guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory  of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the  party's basic line, we will comprehensively implement the spirit  of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee  and seize the favorable opportunity to increase the momentum of  reform and opening up and to expedite development. On the basis  of optimizing structure, improving quality, and producing better  economic results, we will maintain the sustained, speedy, and  healthy development of the national economy. According to this  guiding principle, Governor Tian Chengping requested all  localities and departments to expedite the establishment of the  socialist market economic structure in this new year and to  further widen the scope of opening up to the rest of the country  and the world.    He said: This year is a crucial year for making overall  progress and breaking through focal points in economic  structural reform. There is a need to actively carry out  enterprise reform in light of the province's specific  conditions, to conscientiously implement the state's  macrocontrol and regulatory measures, to further strengthen the  position of agriculture and animal husbandry as the foundation,  to develop the rural economy, to increase investments in  resource exploitation, and to expedite the development of energy  and raw materials industries.</p>

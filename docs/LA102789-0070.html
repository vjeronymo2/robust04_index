			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> WASHINGTON, D.C.;  </P> <P> EXTRA $3.2 BILLION FOR DRUG WAR URGED  </P> <P> House and Senate negotiators agreed to provide $3.2 billion this year to beef  up the Bush Administration's war on drugs and other crime-fighting ventures.  The money represents the major congressional role in the war on drugs this  year. Despite the aura of urgency surrounding the issue, lawmakers had taken no  action on the funding since the Senate approved it a month ago. The decision by  a House and Senate conference committee got the money moving again and brought  total funding for the drug war to $8.8 billion.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] On 7 June, the Social Democratic Party of Japan  [SDPJ] set a policy of putting together a party governing  concept in order to form a new coalition government after the  Diet passes the fiscal year 1994 budget. The party's goal is to  press Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata either to have his cabinet  resign en masse or to choose the path of rejecting the concept,  dissolving the Diet, and calling a general election. The  pillars of the SDPJ's governing concept include: (1) Respecting  the ideals of the constitution; and (2) taking responsibility  for and a role in global peace and disarmament. Based on the  items agreed upon by each party in the Hosokawa coalition  government at the time of its establishment in August 1993, the  SDPJ will put "protecting the constitution" in the forefront.  The SDPJ's governing concept will also specifically call for  reforming the decisionmaking system for the government and  ruling parties to make it a democratic and open one. The SDPJ  will decide on beginning party procedures in its Central  Executive Committee as early as 9 June. In addition, Committee  Chairman Tomiichi Murayama is planning to call on Prime Minister  Hata to hold a party summit where he will present the SDPJ's  ideas in detail.    The new governing concept is based on the thinking that,  according to a senior party executive: "The SDPJ was pressed at  the April policy conference of the coalition government parties  to ratify the policy accord put together by the other parties.  We were thus unable to put forth our own positions." The  party's aim in formulating the new concept is to play the lead  role in the government conference by putting forth its own ideas  first.    In particular, in taking seriously the debate following the  argument of Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa and others for  changing the constitutional interpretation on the right to  collective self- defense, there is gaining ground in the SDPJ  the view that there must be a clear reflection on World War II.  Concerning the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North  Korea) nuclear development issue, there is a wish to go beyond  the April policy conference to a concrete response in  strengthening further the position of "resolving the issue  through talks within the framework of the constitution."    Concerning government and ruling party decisionmaking, too,  the SDPJ's governing concept will press for a reform of the  council of party representatives led by Shinseito [Japan Renewal  Party] Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa and other party executives  as well a shift to "ruling party summits" and other "forums for  open discussion" previously proposed by SDPJ Central Executive  Committee Chairman Murayama.</p>

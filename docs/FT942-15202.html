			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Man in the News: Deal-maker with a dark side - FT writers on a disappearing property wunderkind / Jurgen Schneider Until this week, the most obviously fake element in the make-up of Jurgen Schneider was his highly mobile toupee. A businessman facing ruin after this week's disappearance of Germany's top-rank property king  - leaving a heap of debts so far estimated at around DM5bn  - recalls a recent social encounter with the wandering hairpiece. 'I was chatting away to him, mesmerised by that appalling rug, watching it sliding slowly forwards. His wife pretended to pat him on the back of the head and, believe you me, watching it slide back up was pretty unnerving,' he says. 'Now he's pulled the rug on me.' Just one of thousands of contractors  - architects, engineers, builders and furnishers  - facing hefty losses or worse from Schneider's difficulties, he remains philosophical. 'All my research told me he was dodgy, but I took a chance.' He was not the only one concerned about the vanishing Frankfurter's credibility. Managers at a leading non-German bank were approached for a loan last summer. But its credit committee had heard too much on the grapevine and turned him down. Mr Martin Kohlhaussen, chairman of Commerzbank, badly burned in Britain's Canary Wharf fiasco, said yesterday that Schneider had approached his credit department to top up existing loans of a good DM100m. He was turned away on the basis of information he supplied. Contractors, architects, consulting engineers and other suppliers based around his palatial headquarters in Konigstein have long refused to do business with him. They freely accuse him of highly dubious methods to raise financing and, above all, to avoid paying his bills. One creditor, who claims to have an unpaid invoice for DM3.25m, says the slightest fault in completed work could lead to a refusal to pay. Payment delays of six months are said not to have been uncommon. Authoritative German media reports suggest this was among the most common of his tactics: squeezing over-blown credits out of his big lenders by presenting them with inflated estimates of the rentable area  - and therefore the potential rental income  - in his 75 grandiose retail, hotel and office projects. None of this appears to have troubled Schneider's Konigsteiner neighbours: the front-rank German bankers and folk who until this week shared with him the pleasures of life in the Taunus hills above Frankfurt, and this week declared themselves 'thunderstruck'. Bankers may have been impressed by his legendary tight-fistedness with creditors, but they apparently failed to consider that it might have signalled something more sinister than assiduous cost control: liquidity problems. If they had cared to listen, they might have heard the rumblings back in 1992, when he broke for the first time with his tradition of renovating grand buildings and letting them at grand prices. He sold the centrally-placed Furstenhof office building in Frankfurt to a Japanese group for an estimated DM450m. That building, incidentally, stood empty until recently and is now rented by Dresdner Bank, which, it emerged this week is one of Schneider's leading creditors. The banks might also have weighed their outstanding credits against Schneider's income forecasts in the light of a steady softening in German rents over the past 18 months. CIP, his group's management arm - believed to be 30 per cent controlled by Schneider himself and 70 per cent by an anonymous foundation  - still claims 'going' prices for retail space in central Leipzig are DM200 a square metre. Rivals, on the other hand, suggest DM120 to DM150 is closer to the mark. Other signs of possible trouble included his decision last year dramatically to slow for six months all work on one of his grandest designs  - the restoration of Wiesbaden's Rose Hotel. Last February, Schneider attracted unwelcome attention when a group of trade creditors went to court and successfully forced him to pay up. A qualified construction engineer, the 59-year-old Schneider only attracted the wider public gaze after unification in 1990, when he moved quickly to pick up prime but dilapidated properties in eastern cities like Leipzig. Before that, he had built up his business more quietly from a small start in 1981. The family concern, headed by his father, Richard, closed in the late 1980s. Industry observers say the closure was followed by a worsening of relations between the two men. The conclusion now being drawn by observers is that the banks felt they could ignore rumour and rumblings  - common enough at the best of times in the property business  - secure in the knowledge that their debts, thought to be the lion's share of the total which has so far come to light, were secured against 80-odd of the classiest properties and sites in Germany. The conclusions being drawn by unsecured creditors and their employees are less complacent. 'The so-and-so has left us high and dry,' said a workman collecting his tools from the stilled Bartels Hof site in Leipzig. 'There we were, thinking the great man from the west would come with money and jobs and make the city a great place. Now look what has happened . . .' Chancellor Helmut Kohl, not noted for his sensitivity, has for once been quick to pick up on the scale of the crisis facing the thousands of employees and unsecured creditors. With one eye on federal elections and another on the recent near-catastrophe in which banks prevented the collapse of the Metallgesellschaft group only with a DM3.4bn rescue package, he reminded the banks their responsibilities extended beyond their profit and loss accounts. He also ordered a review of insolvency laws which can leave unsecured creditors with no real recourse. Schneider, meanwhile, has disappeared without leaving any evident trail. Colourful press speculation say he and his wife, Claudia, plus baggage, his favoured Gucci shoes and other trappings (including spare wigs), could be anywhere between Switzerland, Barbados and Iran, depending on the range of his private jet. He has also left the wreckage of the ingenious corporate structure he erected within his privately-held empire which only now may come under real public scrutiny. According to a creditor with more than two years experience of Schneider's eccentric ways, the main parts of the business present two contrasting faces. The dark side is represented by Technoteam, a contracting division owned by the man himself. 'They have a terrific reputation for getting the job done by squeezing and beating the hell out of sub-contractors,' the contractor says. But they appear not to be so efficient at the subtler business of controlling overall contract costs. That may in part be due to the erratic ways of Schneider himself, who last year, part-way through the Wiesbaden Rose Hotel project decided that instead of a five-star hotel with 220 rooms, it should be a 77-room super-luxury hostelry  - 'the best in Europe,' he said. He also decided a three-level underground car park would enhance it even further. The hole was accordingly dug and equipped with mechanical lifts and gear for getting cars in and out, at an estimated cost of DM10m. Only later did Schneider realise that guests leaving a 150-head corporate dinner party might not appreciate three-minute delay incurred in getting a single car in or out. The more acceptable face of the group was represented in the world outside the hurly-burly of the building site by CIP, which managed and let completed properties, and is now the vehicle which creditor banks hope to use to salvage the maximum from the wreckage. 'They seemed very competent,' one source says, adding that Schneider himself was also a far less dramatic character than some would have the world believe. 'No, he was very calm, almost paternal. He was hard but fair . . . Hard on his team, too. Directors were expected to be at his morning meetings by 6am and ready to start 'work' at 7am.' But at top-level negotiations on contracts, he was invariably flanked by a tough young lieutenant, who often gave the impression he was a lawyer  - an impression blurred by his penchant for 'simplistic, brutal contracts', not to mention a tendency to thump the table and yell. In contacts with the outside world, the veneer was perfected by Schneider's demeanour and the reputation of an aide from the noble von Lambsdorff family, internationally known thanks to the political career of Otto, former leader of the Liberal Democrat family. But the polish has been brutally scraped away by the events of this week. The empire which supported Schneider's extravagant habits and the foundations and bursaries which lent him a philanthropical air has been exposed as just another of his many unfinished projects  - an impressive facade on the outside with a big hole behind it.</p>

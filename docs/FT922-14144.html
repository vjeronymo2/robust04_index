			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / International Company News: Komatsu, Krupp in mobile crane marketing accord KOMATSU, the world's second largest construction equipment group, will shortly begin marketing Krupp mobile cranes in Japan. The marketing deal has significant long-term potential for the German steel and engineering group. The agreement follows a commitment by the Japanese company to help European producers expand in Japan, where they have found it difficult to establish a foothold. For Komatsu, the deal will emphasise that its links with Europe are not a 'one-way business,' according to Mr Frithjof Timm, president and managing director of Komatsu Europe. Until January 1, Mr Timm was the head of Krupp Industrietechnik's crane division in Wilhelmshaven, northern Germany. There, he spent 18 months negotiating the deal with Komatsu. Krupp has designed a special model in line with the higher axle loads required for larger cranes in Japan. The prototype is in Japan now for specification approval and Krupp hopes to deliver 20 more this year. The deal is Krupp's second attempt to break into the Japanese crane market. An earlier agreement with Tadano of Japan was dissolved in the mid-1980s. Krupp will also sell in Japan, through Komatsu, its existing all-terrain cranes with lifting capacity above 100 tons. Komatsu's range does not extend beyond 25 tons. Krupp, along with the two German producers, Liebherr and Mannesmann Demag, dominates the world market for all-terrain mobile cranes. Liebherr has a dealer in Japan, while Demag has its own sales team. Komatsu, meanwhile. says it will use this week's Bauma construction equipment exhibition in Munich to establish contact with more potential European component sources.</p>

			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / London Clubs faces threat to gaming licences THE POLICE and the Gaming Board have applied to magistrates for cancellation and non-renewal of gaming licences held by London Clubs, calling the company 'not fit and proper' to manage casinos - the gravest charge in British gaming regulations. The decision follows a raid in June on the main casinos owned by London Clubs. Detailed grounds for the action, which run to several pages, were given to London Clubs' management yesterday. London Clubs' casinos include the Ritz Club in Piccadilly and the recently opened Les Ambassadeurs at the end of Park Lane. It also manages the Carlton casino in Cannes. The company, which has vigorously denied any wrong-doing, intends to defend its record point by point in the licensing hearing, expected to start late next month. Mr Max Kingsley, managing director of London Clubs, said last night: 'Now that we have seen the grounds for the objections our position is simply that we have found nothing in them that would justify cancellation or non-renewal of our licences. We shall be fighting the case all the way.' The hearing is expected to last four or five weeks. Disposal of the properties to a new operator would be difficult to arrange, after recent Gaming Board moves to tighten up the transfer of licences. If the magistrates granted cancellation the premises could not be used for gambling for three years. Annual profits of London Clubs are estimated at Pounds 20m. The recession has made life tougher for casinos, but London Clubs' managers claim they are holding their own. The raid in June came days before a planned flotation of shares in London Clubs - 250 police and the Gaming Board inspectorate went into the clubs and removed about 60,000 documents. The Gaming Board declined to have any contact with the company to explain its action, until yesterday's official decision to proceed against it. What the police were looking for has never been revealed. The detailed grounds given yesterday are understood to cover eight different matters, only one of which is claimed to be a breach of the Gaming Act.</p>

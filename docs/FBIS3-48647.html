Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong is to preside over a  meeting of working-level officials from the Foreign, Home,  Justice, Transportation, Trade, Industry and Energy, and Finance  ministries and the Agency for National Security Planning next  week to decide on the liberalization, the sources said. An  inter-ministry meeting in November last year agreed on the need  to liberalize travel to China during 1994, they said.    "There is no particular objection from the concerned  ministries so the decision will probably be made at next week's  meeting," an official said.    Under a prime ministerial decree, the basic guidelines for  cooperation and exchange with the so-called "northern"  countries, government permission is currently required to visit  China.    If a decision is made to liberalize travel to China, the  basic guidelines will be amended so that Cuba, Laos and Cambodia  will remain classified as "specific countries." Government  permission for travel to those countries is given only on the  basis of invitations from the countries.</p>

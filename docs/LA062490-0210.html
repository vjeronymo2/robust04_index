			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WARM REMEMBRANCES OF SLAIN GIRL, 9;  </P> <P> CRIME: FAMILY, FRIENDS AND PLAYMATES RECALL AUTUMN WALLACE AS BRIGHT,  FUN-LOVING AND CONSIDERATE. THE CHILD WAS APPARENTLY KILLED DURING A BURGLARY  AT HER HOME.  </P> <P> Friends, family and classmates of Autumn Wallace, a 9-year-old slain during an  apparent burglary, remembered her Saturday as a bright, outgoing little girl  who evoked laughter and warmth from all who knew her.  </P> <P> "Sometimes there are people like that who are so special that they teach us  about life," the Rev. Michael Bradaric told nearly 200 people who gathered for  the funeral at Magnolia Baptist Church. "Autumn was one of those special  people."  </P> <P> The little girl was stabbed to death June 15 at her home on Hedlund Drive in an  unincorporated area between Stanton and Anaheim, north of Katella Avenue.  Police believe she was killed during a burglary committed while she was alone  in the house.  </P> <P> Autumn's 18-year-old sister, April, said she arrived home from work and noticed  several things missing from the house, including a television, videotape  recorder and mirror. Frightened, she went across the street to a neighbor's  house until her mother, Linda Wallace, returned home from work.  </P> <P> Linda Wallace found Autumn's body in a back bathroom.  </P> <P> No arrests have been made so far.  </P> <P> Residents in the quiet, residential community expressed shock and many said  they wondered how a playful little girl could be struck down by such a  senseless and random act.  </P> <P> It is a question always asked when such a young life is taken, Bradaric said.  </P> <P> "There isn't any way our question will ever be answered," he said. "It's simply  not possible. The sacred things of God are secret and too high for us. There  are some things God does that we don't understand and this is one of them."  </P> <P> From aisles festooned with pink and white balloons and dozens of pink and white  roses, carnations and lilies of the valley, those who knew Autumn Wallace rose  to share their memories.  </P> <P> "I worked with her mother and Autumn came in and would always be laughing,"  Sally White said. "She would come and play with the typewriter and play office.  We enjoyed having her here every day."  </P> <P> One classmate said she liked to play tetherball with Autumn because she was  never stingy and didn't brag about winning.  </P> <P> Autumn was mature for her age: a straight "A" student at Dr. Jonas E. Salk  Elementary School who loved to play basketball, Nintendo and other computer  games. She enjoyed going to Chuck E. Cheese for its array of video games,  although she hated pizza, her friends said.  </P> <P> After the half-hour service, mourners filed slowly past the white, open casket  in which Autumn clutched her favorite teddy bear. But many tendered a smile  rather than tears.  </P> <P> "This is an occasion to remind us how important it is to value the lives of our  children," Bradaric said. "Sometimes they are remembered as a responsibility or  a burden, but we need to remember they are a precious gift God has given us."  </P> <P> Autumn Wallace was later buried at Forest Lawn Cemetery in Cypress. An Anaheim  group, the Anaheim Citizens Against Violent Crime Reward Trust, is offering an  $8,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the  killer of Autumn Wallace.  </P> <P> A memorial fund has been established in her name at the Wells Fargo Bank, P.O.  Box 629, Anaheim 92805, attention B. Mangione.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Rebroadcast of Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev's </F> address to nation on 12 April--recorded]    [Excerpt] Esteemed compatriots, sisters and brothers,  citizens of the Azerbaijani Republic, the intensification of  Armenia's aggression against Azerbaijan in recent days, and the  situation engendered by the escalation of the Armenian Armed  Forces' attacks against Azerbaijani land forced me to come to  the Azerbaijani television station tonight. My aim is to inform  you on the prevailing situation and to express some of my views  on this situation.    As you know, the Azerbaijani state and its leadership aim at  putting an end to the ongoing war between Armenia and  Azerbaijan, and for this purpose is trying to achieve a certain  agreement by holding peace talks. We have taken many steps in  this direction. We are always trying to make use of the  possibilities of the international organizations. We accept the  big powers' initiatives and try to benefit from them. We have  established contacts with the Armenian Republic and are holding  talks with them. Recently we accepted the mediation initiative  of the Russian state, and through the Russian Foreign and  Defense Ministries we have given our consent to a certain  agreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan.    I do not intend now to analyze all the processes in recent  months for you. However, I want to single out some facts. As  you know, during the CIS meeting in Ashgabat on 24 December last  year, I met with Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan and held  detailed talks with him and made proposals to end the ongoing  war between Azerbaijan and Armenia. We held a broad exchange of  views. At that very same CIS meeting, I made an extensive  statement on Armenia's aggression against Azerbaijan over the  last few years, invited the CIS leaders to intervene in this  problem, and declared that war between the CIS states is  abnormal and that therefore the head of each state should  express his own stance on this matter. Later on, the Russian  Foreign Ministry became active. We received the representative  of the Russian Foreign Ministry on various occasions, examined  different draft agreements, submitted our proposals, and tried  to achieve an agreement by making certain compromises. However,  even these did not produce any results. Finally, the defense  ministers of Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Russia met in Moscow on 18  February and a protocol was signed between Armenia and  Azerbaijan on a cease-fire and holding peace talks. We also  accepted this for the simple reason that we have always worked,  and are still working, for the peaceful resolution of the  conflict. According to that protocol, the cease-fire in the  Karabakh zone and on all the fronts was to go into effect  between Azerbaijan and Armenia as of 1 March. This was to be  followed by talks, the withdrawal of Armenia's Armed Forces from  the occupied Azerbaijani lands, and a major agreement. However,  the Armenian side undermined even this agreement. It started to  launch constant attacks against our positions as of 2 March.  Thus, this agreement also produced no result. The chairmen of  the Azerbaijani and Armenian parliaments met in Kazakh on 12  March. They held talks. We were hoping that these agreements  would produce a result. However, later on the Armenian side did  not abide by these agreements and continued with its attacks  against the Azerbaijani lands and Army positions. These attacks  by Armenia's Armed Forces continued until the end of March.  However, I can state with great satisfaction and pride that the  Azerbaijani Army, Army units, our military units and fighters  have checked all these attacks and Armenia's Armed Forces  suffered enormous losses and were forced to withdraw without  achieving anything in Fizulinskiy Rayon, against which they had  mostly directed their attacks.    Despite all this, we continued favoring peace talks, and  almost a week ago Vladimir Kazimirov, the Russian Foreign  Ministry's representative, plenipotentiary ambassador, and the  representative of the Russian president, visited Baku and held  talks with us and presented us with a new draft agreement.

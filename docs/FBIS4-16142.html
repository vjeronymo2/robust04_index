			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The issue of the Black Sea Fleet is to be  resolved in the spirit of the Massandra protocol. A provisional  understanding to this effect has been reached in Kiev at the  meeting of the Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk with a  Russian delegation which included, among other participants,  Yuriy Dubinin, a special envoy of the Russian Foreign Ministry,  and the commander in chief of the Russian Navy, Admiral Feliks  Gromov. I would like to remind you that under the Massandra  document the Ukrainian part of the Black Sea Fleet is to be  handed over to Russia as a part payment towards Ukraine's debt  for the Russian energy resources.

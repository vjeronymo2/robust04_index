			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BAY AREA QUAKE;  </P> <P> TIPS ON SURVIVAL -- DURING AND AFTER THE TREMOR  </P> <P> Here are some frequently asked questions about earthquakes, and some answers  provided by Times Staff Writer Mark Landsbaum.  </P> <P> Question: What should you do if an earthquake hits while you are at home, work  or school?  </P> <P> Answer: As in all circumstances, remain calm. Get away from windows, mirrors  and light fixtures, tall bookcases or China cases that may topple. Stand in a  doorway or under a table or crouch against a solid wall. Get into a  duck-and-cover position using sofa cushions or pillows to protect your head. Do  not run outside.  </P> <P> Q. What if a quake hits while you are in a car?  </P> <P> A. Pull to the side of the road if possible and stop the car. Do not park under  trees, light posts, signs, bridges or overpasses.  </P> <P> Q. What should you do if you are outdoors?  </P> <P> A. Get into the open, away from buildings, power lines and other sources of  falling debris.  </P> <P> Q. What should be done once the shaking stops?  </P> <P> A. Check for injuries. If necessary, administer first aid. Do not move  seriously injured persons unless they are in immediate danger. Keep the injured  warm with blankets. Check utility lines and appliances for damage. Even the  smallest sparks can cause explosions, so do not operate electrical switches or  even a telephone if you smell gas. Do not eat or drink from open containers  near broken glass.  </P> <P> Q. Where can you find safe water to drink if service is cut off?  </P> <P> A. Emergency water supplies can be found in water heaters, toilet tanks, melted  ice cubes and canned vegetables. Water can be disinfected by first draining it  through a clean cloth to remove solids, then by using a 5.25% household bleach  solution. Use one drop to one quart for clear water and four drops to a quart  for cloudy water. Water also can be purified by boiling.  </P> <P> Q. What should you do if you smell gas after an earthquake?  </P> <P> A. Know where your gas meter is and have an adjustable wrench for turning off  the valve. Southern California Gas Co. advises that gas should be turned off  only when there is an odor at the meter or at a connection, such as at the  water heater. Never try to test for escaping gas with a lighter or flame  because of a possible explosion.  </P> <P> Q. What plans can members of your household make?  </P> <P> A. Everyone should know the safest places in the house, away from large panes  of glass, heavy furniture, appliances or veneers such as fireplaces. Know the  location of gas, electric and water main shut-off valves. Have a plan to  reunite the family if members become separated. Know the location of the  nearest fire station.  </P> <P> Q. What can you do about structural flaws in your home?  </P> <P> A. Check your foundation for cracks larger than 1/8-inch that indicate  potential weakness. Check to see that your house is attached with sill bolts to  the foundation. Make sure children's play areas are away from walls that lack  sheathing and from walls of brick or masonry veneer without steel  reinforcement. Seek the advice of an architect, engineer or local building  official on needed repairs or strengthening.  </P> <P> Q. What supplies should you have stored in your home for such an emergency?  </P> <P> A. Items that should be stored in a barrel or trash can: Flashlight, portable  radio, extra batteries, first-aid kit and handbook, two quarts of water for  each family member; enough canned, powdered, freeze-dried or dehydrated foods  to last one week; toothbrush, toothpaste, soap, towel, razor, any needed  prescriptions, antiseptic cream, adhesive tape, alcohol, aspirin, bandages,  gauze, gloves, plastic trash bags, aluminum foil, household bleach, tissues,  pocketknife and can opener, mini-barbecue grill, matches, candles, Sterno  canned heat, screwdriver, wrench and crowbar, sleeping bags, blankets, pencil  and paper. Keep important papers and cash close by.  </P> <P> Q. What supplies should you store in your car?  </P> <P> A. Store these in a nylon, metal or plastic container in the trunk: first aid  kit, 2 quarts of water, toothbrush, comb, soap, towel, razor, any needed  prescriptions, antiseptic cream, aspirin, pocket knife, leather gloves, bottle  opener, matches, flashlight with extra batteries, blanket, dehydrated or canned  food, jumper cables, screwdriver and crowbar, plastic trash bags, pencil and  paper and Sterno.  </P> <P> Q. Any final suggestions?  </P> <P> A. Cooperate with public safety efforts. Use telephones only to report  emergency situations. Don't wander the streets or go in to danger areas unless  your assistance is needed.  </P> <P>  Sources: Southern California Earthquake Preparedness Project, Governor's  Office of Emergency Services, Federal Emergency Management Agency, Orange  County Fire Department, Pacific Bell, the Red Cross, CEPP Corp., Lafferty &amp;  Associates and the Emergency Lifeline, Santa Ana.  </P> <P> </P> <P> How to Help Quake Victims  </P> <P> Donations for San Francisco earthquake victims should be sent to:  </P> <P> American Red Cross  </P> <P> 602 N.

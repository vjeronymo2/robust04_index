			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The SPD Loses Voters to the PDS and </F> the Greens, the FDP to the CDU"]    [Text] A new third force has emerged in German policy --  both in the east and in the west. Despite the different course  of the elections, it is in each case at the expense of the  Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]. The new role is  shared by Alliance 90/Greens in the west, and the Party of  Democratic Socialism [PDS] in the east. Unlike the Christian  Democratic Union [CDU], the social democrats also suffered from  the low voter turnout. This is what the Institute for Applied  Social Sciences (Infas) says in an analysis ordered by DPA,  which we publish in the following slightly abridged and edited  version.    At a glance, the trends in east and west seem to diverge --  losses here and gains there for the Christian Democratic  Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU]; gains here and losses  there for the social democrats. The Free Democratic Party [FDP]  loses little in the west, while it is almost halved in the east.  Alliance 90/Greens stagnate in the east but have clear gains in  the west. The CDU can stabilize its dominating position in east  and west.    The FDP was also existentially weakened by the anti-Europe  party of its former member, Guido Brunner. The 1 percent for  this party would have raised the FDP above the 5-percent hurdle.  However, the stream from the FDP to the CDU was larger than  this movement, namely approximately 400,000 voters net in the  west. In the east -- compared with the 1990 Bundestag elections  -- the number was approximately 200,000.    Another decisive exchange took place between the SPD and  Alliance 90/Greens. The largest shifts in the red-green camp  took place in the large cities and service centers. A total of  660,000 former SPD voters voted for the ecological party. In  the east, no more than 11,000 former SPD voters voted for  Alliance 90/Greens.    In the east, the losses of the SPD to the PDS were of  decisive importance. The net balance was approximately 210,000  voters, which roughly corresponds to the number of inhabitants  in Rostock. The losers of German unity -- no matter of what  persuasion -- voted for the PDS, whereas the winners of German  unity, having temporarily maintained restraint or even voted for  other parties, returned to the CDU. Movements from the SPD to  the PDS were compensated by movements from the CDU to the SPD.    Compared with the 1989 European elections, there were gains  for the CDU/CSU and for Alliance 90/Greens, and losses for the  social democrats, the liberals, and the Republikaner.    The FDP only succeeded in narrowly overcoming the 5-percent  hurdle in Baden-Wuerttemberg. The Republikaner achieved their  relatively best results in Bavaria (6.6 percent) and  Baden-Wuerttemberg (5.9 percent). However, in Bavaria they lost  no less than 8 percentage points, compared with the 1989  European elections; of these protest voters of 1989, many did  not vote this time, and many returned to the CSU.    The largest differences in the west manifested themselves in  the voter turnout. In federal laender where communal elections  took place at the same time, the turnout was clearly higher than  the average 59.5 percent, in the northern laender, it was  equally clearly lower. In the east, too, the voter turnout in  the laender where communal elections were held simultaneously  was also higher. In Brandenburg, however, it was only a little  higher than 40 percent, in Berlin approximately 54 percent, in  the four other laender, between 65 and 70 percent, comparable to  the turnout in Baden-Wuerttemberg.    In the east, in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and  Brandenburg, Alliance 90/Greens remained under 5 percent. In  Mecklenberg-Western Pomerania, the PDS passed the SPD and worked  its way up to second place; in all the other new laender it  reached third place. In Brandenburg, it was just 1 percent  behind the CDU.    Compared with the 1990 Bundestag elections, the percentage  of  FDP votes was generally halved; in Saxony-Anhalt, it was even  reduced to one-third. The PDS percentage roughly doubled in all  new laender. The SPD achieved slight gains (except in  Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania), and the CDU suffered major  losses. Berlin represents a sort of microcosm that reflects the  all-German landscape. The combined result from east and west  shows that the CDU and SPD with 28 percent compete for first  place, while Alliance 90/Greens and the PDS with 14 and 16  percent, respectively, compete for third place.</p>

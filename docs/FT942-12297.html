			<p>940430 FT  30 APR 94 / California sues US over illegal immigrants The state of California is sueing the US government to recover Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) it says it has spent on jailing illegal immigrants who commit crimes, Reuter reports from San Diego. 'California has had enough and it's time to stop illegal immigration,' Governor Pete Wilson said after personally filing the suit in a federal court. The governor's aides said it was the first of a series of lawsuits California plans to file against the federal government to recover billions of dollars spent on providing services to immigrants who stay in the US illegally. Other suits will focus on health, education and welfare  - costs for which California says the federal government is responsible. Mr Wilson said he filed the suit reluctantly and would prefer a political solution. But Congress had failed to deal with the illegal immigrant problem. Under the constitution the federal government was responsible for regulating immigration and had failed abysmally to do so.</p>

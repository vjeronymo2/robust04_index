			<p>BFN     [Text] The government has started preparing a written  refutation of the U.S. Trade Representative [USTR] Office's  "National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers,"  which was released late last month. The Ministry of  International Trade and Industry [MITI] thinks that "the  unilateral report has been compiled based on false premises."  The refutation will be formulated as a report and will be sent  to the U.S. Government as early as mid-April. It will convey  Tokyo's position at every level of upcoming bilateral  negotiations.    In the report on trade barriers, the USTR listed 43 items  deemed to be Japan's "trade barriers," and, in a follow-up news  conference, USTR Counsel General Ira Shapiro stressed that  "Japan's trade barriers are extremely numerous compared to those  of the seven advanced nations."    In reaction, the government criticized the U.S. report,  noting that "the definition of `trade barriers' is unclear and  the report has been written based on the wishes of U.S.  industrial circles" (as stated by MITI). Moreover, the  government said that individual trade barriers are "based on  false premises." As for government procurement of medical and  telecommunications equipment, which has been newly added to the  trade barriers list, the government noted that the "U.S. request  concerning this sector has already been incorporated into our  economic reform guidelines." The government intends to convey  the aforementioned points to the United States.</p>

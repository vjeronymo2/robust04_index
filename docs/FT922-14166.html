			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / UK Company News: Next surprises City with turnround to Pounds 12.3m NEXT, the fashion retailer, surprised the City by announcing pre-tax profits of Pounds 12.3m for the year to end-January, compared with a loss of Pounds 40.7m and after profits of only Pounds 200,000 in the first half. The shares rose 5p to 71p. Next also said it planned a final dividend of 0.75p, after passing the final dividend last year and omitting the interim for 1991-92. Lord Wolfson, chairman, said he anticipated paying both an interim and final dividend for the current year. The profit increase was helped by a Pounds 1.5m pension holiday which Lord Wolfson said would continue for the next two years at least. However, the depreciation charge of Pounds 20.5m included a Pounds 4.5m one-off write-down of fixtures and fittings as the group adopted more conservative policies. The group's results were distorted by the sale of Grattan, its mail order side, last year. Group turnover was Pounds 462m compared with Pounds 878m which included Pounds 401m of sales from discontinued businesses. Operating profits were Pounds 11.1m against a year earlier operating loss of Pounds 2m before a Pounds 9.2m profit from discontinued businesses. Interest receivable was Pounds 1.2m (payable Pounds 14.4m) and there were no exceptional charges (Pounds 33.5m charge). The high street retail operation made an operating profit of Pounds 6.4m (loss Pounds 2.3m), on sales only 3.2 per cent higher at Pounds 282m. After a first half loss of Pounds 1m the second half made Pounds 9.1m before a Pounds 1.7m loss (Pounds 200,000 loss) in the Next to Nothing clearance shops. Lord Wolfson said costs had been cut and ranges improved. The group had managed its stock better, meaning less excess stock. As a result there had not been enough for the group's clearance shops to sell, causing the higher loss there, and all but six had been sold. The Next Directory home shopping business increased operating profits from Pounds 2.6m to Pounds 4m, on sales up from Pounds 87.5m to Pounds 88.1m. The sales gain was less than budgeted but there were fewer markdowns here too. Club 24, the credit card business, lost Pounds 22m but this was charged to the Pounds 33.2m provision set up in the previous financial year. Lord Wolfson said that Pounds 10m of the provision was left but the group did not expect to use it all. Tax was Pounds 900,000 (Pounds 9.3m) which represented advance corporation tax on the proposed dividend. Lord Wolfson said the group would have a low tax charge for the next four years. Earnings per share were 3.08p (losses 13.58p). The balance sheet had cash of Pounds 106.5m at the year end thanks to the sale of Grattan, which raised Pounds 167.5m. The cash will partly be used to redeem the eurobond in October costing Pounds 70.8m in principal with Pounds 22m of supplemental interest. COMMENT It is surprising just how quickly a retail group can be turned round when management gets to grips with the problems. Once the sale of Grattan had secured the group financially, Next could tackle its fundamental problems and set to the task with vigour. The figures are even better than they look given the depreciation charge. The group reckons it has done at least a third of the work, though this is the easiest part, but the momentum is there and staff morale is apparently high. On forecasts of Pounds 22m for the current year, and a low tax charge, the prospective p/e is just over 13 which could come down to under 10 next year. Although the shares have done well there is some more to go for.</p>

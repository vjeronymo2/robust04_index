			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It is important to note that in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cal-Almond, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the Ninth Circuit did not find inherent constitutional harm in the establishment of research and promotion programs designed to increase sales and enhance grower returns. In fact, the Court acknowledged the substantial governmental interest in establishing such programs in order to maintain and expand the markets for agricultural commodities. The Court's complaint lay with the unique design of the former almond advertising and promotion program, with the lack of record proof that it directly advanced the stated interests, and with the fact that the former creditable advertising requirements seemed more extensive than necessary to achieve the approved goals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> The New Credit-Back Advertising and Promotion Program <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An interim final rule published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on August 17, 1993, [57 FR 43500] represents the most recent and extensive revision to the Order's advertising and promotion program. Due to changes in the size and structure of the California almond industry during the 1980's and 1990's, as well as the fact that more handlers were beginning to sell almonds for use as ingredients in manufactured products rather than for direct consumption, there was a general perception within the industry that a new and innovative program needed to be implemented which would be even more effective than the former program in promoting the sale of California almonds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This prompted the Board and its Public Relations and Advertising Committee to seek to create a new and widely accepted advertising and promotion program designed to aid the further development of the almond industry. On April 20, 1993, by a vote of 9&hyph;1, the Board recommended the new Credit-Back advertising and promotion program. The sole Board member opposing the new program was generally opposed to the entire concept of creditable advertising and promotion. This Board member asserted that all handlers should be required to fund a generic promotion program equally and that any brand advertising done on their own should be carried out at their own expense without any type of Board oversight. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The new Credit-Back advertising and promotion program recognizes new marketing techniques which have been developed by the industry over the years, and is intended to work with and complement a strong generic advertising and promotion program which will be undertaken by the Board. The premise of the new program is that individual handlers will be most effective in promoting their own portion of the almond crop while the Board will be the most effective vehicle through which to enhance total demand for almonds through a generic advertising and promotion program. Some of the significant features of the new program are as follows. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the new program, as modified in this final rule, handlers conducting their own advertising and promotional activities will receive credit against their Credit-Back assessment up to the amount of the Credit-Back assessment installment due if they conduct and document their advertising and promotional activities at least two weeks prior to assessment billings. If handlers do not conduct any advertising and promotional activities prior to assessment billings, they will be required to submit their advertising and promotional assessment when billed. If handlers conduct advertising and promotional activities after assessment billings and file appropriate documentation, they will be eligible for a refund or Credit-Back. Handlers will be billed in four equal installments during the crop year. Handlers are not obligated to take part in the new program. Each handler must make an individual decision whether or not to participate in the new program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The new Credit-Back program substantially expands the list of advertising and promotional activities which will be eligible for credit under the regulations. The range of activities eligible for credit cover virtually every sales assistance, promotional, publicity and advertising area which a brand or individual company could use to aid in product sales, with the exception of price reductions. In all, there are now fourteen advertising, promotion and public relations categories of activities which will be eligible for credit. These include marketing research, paid media advertising directed to end-users, trade or industrial users, in-store demonstrations, trade fairs, seminars and exhibits, couponing, sponsorships, printing costs, trade and consumer product publicity, direct mailings, sales and marketing presentation kits, and 50/50 advertising with retailers. Each of these activities are widely used and accepted forms of marketing advertising and promotion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another aspect of the new program is the elimination of the 33% discount which was formerly allowed to handlers who paid their assessments directly to the Board by a specified date. Under the former creditable advertising and promotion program, handlers who paid their assessments to the Board by a specific date received a 150% credit against the advertising and promotional portion of their assessments. These payments were then used by the Board for generic advertising and promotion. In effect, this allowed handlers a 33% discount on a portion of their assessments. The purpose of the discount at the time was to encourage smaller handlers which did not have individual advertising and promotional programs to contribute to the Board's generic advertising and promotion program. Many members of the industry believed, however, that handlers who received the benefit of the discount did not always pass it on to growers and thus achieved a competitive advantage over handlers who engaged in individual advertising and promotional programs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another feature of the new program is an appeals process whereby handlers have the option of anonymity in the event a claim for a promotional activity is denied. Handlers may request that the Public Relations and Advertising Committee review Board staff decisions concerning denied claims. If not satisfied with that committee's decision, handlers may request that the Board review the issue. Handlers have the option of anonymity when their appeal is brought before the Board. Finally, handlers may request that the Department review the Board's decisions. The Department may review all decisions at any point during the appeals process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The new Credit-Back program also offers handlers more flexibility in getting credit against their assessments for their own advertising and promotional activities compared with the former creditable advertising and promotion program. Some examples of the ways in which the new Credit-Back program offers handlers more flexibility are as follows. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PACIFIC 10 CONFERENCE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> ARIZONA GETS HELP FROM ROOKS AND ROUTS WASHINGTON STATE  </P> <P> Sean Rooks, a 6-11 sophomore, got Arizona off on the right track, scoring the  19th-ranked Wildcats' first seven points to help send them on to an 81-61  victory over Washington State Saturday in a Pacific 10 game at Tucson.  </P> <P> Arizona (8-2, 3-2) took 15-3 lead and then built a 40-29 halftime advantage  against the smaller Cougars (7-7, 1-3).  </P> <P> The Wildcats began the second half with a 15-2 run to put the game out of  reach.  </P> <P> Rooks finished with 18 points and three blocked shots.  </P> <P> "Sean really came through for us in the starting spot, but we still need more  rebounds from him," Arizona Coach Lute Olson said. Rooks had only three  rebounds.  </P> <P> Arizona used the full-court press and a tough zone defense to force 19  turnovers.  </P> <P> Washington State Coach Kelvin Sampson said his team practiced against the press  but couldn't emulate Arizona's height and pressure on inbounds passes.  </P> <P> Arizona guard Harvey Mason said: "I think you'll see us press more from now on  because we like to tire the other team out."  </P> <P> Washington State shot only 35.9% to Arizona's 44.8%, and had 14 fewer rebounds.  </P> <P> The victory was Arizona's 40th in a row at home, the nation's current longest  streak.  </P> <P> Arizona St. 63, Washington 48 -- Matt Anderson scored 18 points, Alex Austin  added 17 and the Sun Devils made 10 three-point shots at Tempe.  </P> <P> It was the fourth consecutive victory for the Sun Devils (8-4, 2-2) and eighth  win in the last nine games.  </P> <P> Washington (6-6, 1-3) was held to its lowest point total this season.  </P></p>

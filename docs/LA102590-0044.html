			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SOCIETY: 39 'ELIGIBLES' ALL SET FOR BIDDING WAR  </P> <P> As the competition for the charity dollar quickens, fund-raising tactics grow  more and more inventive.  </P> <P> If you happened to stroll past the terrace of the Golden Triangle's Paparazzi  restaurant Monday evening, rest assured that your eyes did not deceive you --  there were indeed more than 30 masked men drinking beer and holding forth over  a buffet of deviled eggs and stuffed endive leaves.  </P> <P> The group represented nearly the full complement of 39 unattached but most  eligible single men recruited by the local chapter of the March of Dimes to  place their persons on the auction block at "Bid for Bachelors," a major event  to be given Nov. 9 at the Hyatt Regency La Jolla hotel.  </P> <P> The men, not only masked but also wearing identification tags bearing only  their first names, were present to mingle with some of the single women who  have anted $50 each for preferred seating at the bachelor sell-off.  </P> <P> The event doesn't quite match Sadie Hawkins Day, but it comes close in spirit:  In the case of each bachelor, the woman who makes the highest bid is entitled  to a date. Nor are these rendezvous of the commonplace dinner-and-a-movie  variety, because the men have put together "dream date" packages, most of which  include travel and several of which head as far afield as the Utah snowfields,  Mexico City and the Caribbean.  </P> <P> High bids at previous bachelor auctions have exceeded $2,000, and this year  women with constricted pocketbooks have been encouraged to invite sponsors --  just as at charity walk-a-thons -- to underwrite their efforts. Talk about  novel twists.  </P> <P> The group of men includes physicians, attorneys, photographers and real estate  brokers, as well as an environmental scientist who specializes in pollution  control, a firefighter and a Top Gun pilot.  </P> <P> At Monday's kickoff party, the bachelors, rather unsurprisingly, expressed  unanimous enthusiasm over an upcoming experience that all described as  unprecedented in their lives. Donn Marrin, a Del Mar scientist, said, "This  will be the most unusual thing I've ever done, but I'm ready for it." His "San  Diego by land, air and sea" package offers lunch in La Jolla, a helicopter tour  and dinner and dancing on San Diego Bay aboard the Invader.  </P> <P> To a degree, at least some of the date packages seem competitively designed.  Photographer Vincent Andrewnas has assembled a weekend that will include a  get-acquainted brunch, stays in different hotels each night (separate  accommodations will be provided), three theatrical performances, three dinners,  a "day of beauty" at a top salon, Sunday brunch and a Symphony matinee concert  -- with a lim  </P> <P> ousine always at hand to carry the couple on this sybaritic safari. Many  honeymoons don't entail half as much.  </P> <P> Even though the event will feature a runway jammed with tuxedoed men, it is  being stage-managed by women.  </P> <P> Local March of Dimes executive director Dani Montague, who worked for the same  charity in San Francisco and Portland and assisted with bachelor auctions in  both cities, said the organization founded the concept in Las Vegas in 1985.  </P> <P> "It's been an excellent way for March of Dimes to recruit new volunteers," she  said. " 'Bid for Bachelors' has been successful everywhere it has been held,  and the men associated with the event are the kind we're proud to have  associated with the March of Dimes."  </P> <P> Asked what women should look forward to at the event, co-chair Penny Martin  considered the question less than a moment before responding "Men!" This  probably explained the presence at Paparazzi of the 40 or so women who thus far  have paid $50 for preferred seating. In the words of March of Dimes spokeswoman  Louise Nichols, the women were there to take advantage of "the chance to meet,  interview and preview" the bachelors. Few seemed reticent.  </P> <P> General admission tickets to "Bid for Bachelors" cost $25 in advance, or $30 at  the door. The Nov. 9 event will begin with a 6 p.m. cocktail and "meet the  bachelors" reception; the auction will commence at 7:15 p.m. For further  information, call the March of Dimes.  </P> <P> The passage of time has been of unusual importance to San Diego's Jessop  family, which built the city's most prominent public clock -- now ensconced in  Horton Plaza -- and sold watches to several generations of its citizens.  </P> <P> The passage of the family's first century here (the centennial of the arrival  from England of Joseph and Mary Jessop occurred in August) was both noted and  celebrated at a Oct. 11 tribute in the Marina Ballroom of the San Diego  Marriott. More than 2 dozen of the more than 100 Jessops living in Southern  California attended the benefit for the Copley Family YMCA, along with  representatives of many of the city's older families.  </P> <P> By the time the clock struck 7 p.m., the ballroom's foyer was crowded with a  long-acquainted group that included not only a heavy sprinkling of Jessops, but  representatives of the Fletcher, Klauber, Clark, Gildred, Luce, Frost,  Borthwick and Burnham families.  </P> <P> It was, for most, a familiar get-together, or perhaps a dressy reand Liz  Jessop; Mary and George Carter Jessop; Linda and Bill Fox; Jane and Richard  Lynch; Helen and David Jessop; Mary and Alonzo Lynch; Klonie and Fritz Kunzel;  Bill and Sylvia Luce Heitzmann; Detty June and Phil Klauber; Cathy and Bruce  Frost; Georgia Borthwick with Tom Fleming; Lee and Larry Cox; Betty and Doug  McElfresh; Virginia and Ferd Fletcher; Bobby and Norman Greene; Lyn and Phil  Gildred; Louise and Steve Fletcher, and Mary and Dallas Clark.  </P></p>

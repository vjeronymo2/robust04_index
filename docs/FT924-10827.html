			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: UK accounting Companies and their auditors have a habit of squeezing through fresh gaps in the accounting maze once old ones have been fenced off. But there are good reasons to believe that the new standard known as FRS 3 will put an end to many of the sleights of hand which confused investors in the past. In future, for example, the impact of property write downs and currency translation - this last so damaging to Polly Peck shareholders - will have to be shown in a separate statement to the profit and loss account rather than being buried away in the notes. The effect on companies' depreciation policies where assets are revalued will also have to be highlighted. And the turnover and profits totals will be usefully split into continuing and discontinued operations. From the market's point of view, though, the biggest challenge will be grappling for a reliable measure of earnings per share. Quite rightly, the Accounting Standards Board has given up the long and unequal struggle to separate exceptionals from extraordinaries and has opted to throw everything above the line. But the result may be a good deal of confusion as analysts and investors strive to establish what they believe is the underlying trend. There will be no single formula, but then that reflects the real world. You would hardly strip out disposal profits for the likes of Hanson, but you probably would exclude them in the case of a group which sells businesses only once in a blue moon. No doubt companies, as well as publishing the erratic figure which will flow from FRS 3, will try to massage the market towards a number of their own. But at least they - and independent commentators - will be arguing on the basis of fuller information. There should be much less discretion for an auditor's judgment.</p>

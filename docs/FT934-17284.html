			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Atlas Conv Equip falls to Pounds 1.38m SHARES IN Atlas Converting Equipment fell 147p to 533p yesterday after the engineering equipment group reported a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.27m to Pounds 1.38m in the first half of 1993. Mr Christopher Rogers, chairman, said difficult trading had continued throughout the first half. The increase in orders experienced at the time of announcement of the 1992 results in April was not sustained. The Far East sales office was experiencing a good level of enquiries and there were signs that North American customers were considering further investment although it was the beginning of the cycle. Demand in Europe for capital equipment was low with no signs of improvement. He added that margins remained under pressure. Turnover was Pounds 19.1m (Pounds 20.6m). Earnings per share fell to 10.01p (17.6p), taking account of the Pounds 11m rights issue in May. The interim dividend is maintained at 7p.</p>

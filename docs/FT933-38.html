			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (9): Preconditions of reform - India needs to retain economic stability STABILISATION should not be confused with structural reform. But the two are intimately related. Losses of public sector enterprises and subsidies, both causes of economic waste, contributed directly to India's fiscal difficulties. Similarly, distortion-induced economic inefficiency and consequent low growth contributed indirectly to those difficulties. Yet another link is the balance of payments crisis of 1991, largely the product of fiscal mismanagement, but also the starting point for the present reforms. Now, argues the finance minister, Dr Manmohan Singh, the reform programme could survive almost anything, except inflation and yet another balance of payments crisis. Stability regained must, he insists, be retained. Not long ago India's historic record of stability appeared lost. In June 1991, it was on the verge of default on its external debt, foreign exchange reserves were equivalent to two weeks of imports and the annual rate of wholesale price inflation had reached the intolerable level of nearly 17 per cent. Moreover, in the financial year ending in March 1991, the central government's gross fiscal deficit was 8.4 per cent of gross domestic product, while the current account deficit was equivalent to 2.6 per cent of GDP and a third of exports of goods and non-factor services. The subsequent two and a quarter years have seen a remarkable change. Foreign exchange reserves are up from Dollars 1.1bn to Dollars 7.3bn (see chart); the dollar value of exports between April and July of 1993 was 27 per cent greater than in the same period of last year; foreign investors are showing increasing interest in India; and inflation is down to a little over 6 per cent. In addition, the central government's fiscal deficit was 5.2 per cent of GDP in the latest financial year, while the current account deficit was a third smaller than in 1990-91, if up on 1991-92. 'With all the problems we have had,' claims Dr Singh, 'it is a miracle the programme is still intact.' For all that, success has not been unalloyed. One virtually inevitable problem has been recession, with growth of GDP declining to 1.2 per cent in 1991-92. But economic growth recovered fairly quickly, to about 4.2 per cent in 1992-93, with a further increase of about 5 per cent expected this year. Industrial output also stagnated between 1990-91 and 1991-92, before mounting a modest recovery. Unfortunately, industrial output was then adversely affected by the disturbances at the end of 1992, rising above the level attained in the same month of the previous year only in May 1993. The decline in economic growth was modest in the circumstances. It was also inevitable. Nevertheless, it has tended to undermine one of the government's most important achievements: fiscal consolidation. The finance minister had planned a central budget deficit of 4.7 per cent of GDP this financial year. He now admits that the outcome, on current trends, is likely to be at least one percentage point higher. Industrial recessions reduce tax revenues. Since import duties generate close to 20 per cent of total fiscal revenue, lower imports themselves significantly reduce fiscal receipts. With the dollar value of imports between April and July 3 per cent below that in the corresponding period of the previous year, despite the abolition of foreign exchange and import controls, the consequences for revenue have been unfavourable. Excessive expenditures, particularly on subsidies, are also a problem. At present, central budgetary subsidies - budgeted to be 1.1 per cent of GDP this financial year, down from 2.3 per cent in 1990-91 - are bound to overshoot. This would be true even if a fiscal correction were to be made immediately after the four state elections expected in November and December. Any long-lasting fiscal slippage would be dangerous, perhaps not immediately in current recessionary conditions, but in the longer term. Understandably, the governor of the Reserve Bank of India, Dr C Rangarajan, has expressed serious concern to the government over expansion of net RBI credit to the government, which is running at almost three times the budgeted level for the current financial year. This is not just potentially inflationary. So long as the government runs large and persistent fiscal deficits, it will find it difficult to eschew forced borrowing from the banks and impossible to continue paying anything close to market real rates of interest. In the 1980s, it should be recalled, the central government fiscal deficit was between 7 and 9 per cent of GDP in every year from 1984-85 to 1990-91. Over the same period, the ratio of total government debt to GDP rose from 51 to 66 per cent, while the ratio of external debt to GDP rose from 16 to 29 per cent. The crisis of 1991 was the virtually inevitable result. That crisis did at least prove the trigger for present efforts at reform. Now, by contrast, persistently large fiscal deficits would be the greatest single threat to reform. Vijay Joshi and IMD Little of Oxford University argue, on admittedly quite conservative assumptions, that a sustainable position for India would be one with a current account deficit of less than 1 per cent of GDP and a small central government surplus, excluding net interest payments.(1) The latter would, in turn, imply an overall central government fiscal deficit of about 3 per cent of GDP, roughly half of that now expected for 1993-94 and below even the budgeted level for this year. Still more important, these authors stress, than the inadequate persistence and scale of the fiscal adjustment is its poor quality, a point on which two Indian economists, Jagdish Bhagwati and TN Srinivasan, agree in a paper they have prepared at the request of the finance minister.(2) Half or more of the reduction in the fiscal deficit has come from a decline in capital expenditure, itself an important reason for the persistence of the industrial recession. A squeeze on public investment, particularly in infrastructure, threatens future growth of the economy. That danger is exacerbated by curbs on loans to important public sector enterprises, which are simultaneously restricted in their ability to raise funds in the capital market by the government's unwillingness to push for outright privatisation. At the same time, inadequate efforts have been made to rein in wages paid by government, whose share in GDP rose by one and a half percentage points in the 1980s. Equally important has been the failure to eliminate most of the remaining subsidies, particularly on fertilisers (budgeted at 0.5 per cent of GDP in 1993-94). Even food subsidies (budgeted at 0.4 per cent of GDP, though likely to prove larger this year) could be sharply reduced, without adversely affecting the poor, since, as the World Bank rightly notes, 'the public distribution system is not targeted at the poor to any significant extent'. Generally, cost recovery needs to be a central element in all government programmes, both at the centre and state levels. The failure to charge adequately is neither economically efficient nor does it benefit the poor, who are rarely able to obtain scarce subsidised inputs. Tax reform is important for both structural adjustment and stabilisation. Present plans for reform call for lower import duties, for example. This may not lower revenue if the ratio of trade to GDP grows and most duty exemptions are eliminated. However, less distorting forms of revenue will be needed. Centre-state fiscal relations also require reform. Change here is particularly important because revenue from customs tariffs accrues solely to the centre under the Indian constitution, while revenue from personal income tax or excise duties are shared with the states. The Chelliah Report on tax reform has recommended, in response, that the central and state governments move from sharing specific taxes to general revenue sharing.(3) Tax reform does matter. So does sustaining the overall tax effort. But, as the World Bank notes, the tax to GDP ratio in India, at 16.9 per cent in the second half of the 1980s, compares well with that in other low income countries. Fiscal stabilisation cannot be achieved by additional revenue raising alone. Thus, the finance ministry's agenda, which includes reduction and redirection of subsidies, higher administered prices, limiting budgetary allocations to public sector undertakings and generally tighter expenditure control, apart from tax reform, should be implemented in full.(4) Above all, inevitably scarce budgetary resources must be redirected towards development and welfare expenditures that only the public sector can undertake and away from finance of public sector undertakings and indiscriminate subsidies. Privatisation is vital here and would also help lower the present excessively high levels of public sector debt. The intersection between the twin causes of stabilisation and structural reform falls precisely where the public sector colossus now sits. Failing a redrawing of the role of the public sector, it may well prove impossible to sustain progress towards fiscal stabilisation. Without such stabilisation, the RBI's role as central bank will be subverted, inflation will no longer remain in control, the financial system will not be restructured and, ultimately, reform will founder. Stabilisation is not the same thing as structural reform. But a rethinking of the role of the Indian public sector is unquestionably a precondition for both.

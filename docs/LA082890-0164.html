			<p><P> August 28, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> FAKE TOTO TOTAL FLOP, CLUB SAYS  </P> <P> The owner of a nightclub is offering refunds to disgruntled customers who paid  to see the rock band Toto but instead got some stand-ins led by the band's  former lead singer. The pseudo-Toto was headed by Toto's former lead singer,  Bobby Kimball, who left the band in 1984 to pursue a solo career.  </P> <P> "I feel like I was slightly deceived by Kimball and his manager," said Larry  Hurwitz, the owner of the Starry Night club.  </P> <P> A spokeswoman for Toto's management company said it's not the first time  Kimball has used the Toto name. "We've gotten reports all over the country,  from Florida and now the Northwest and Europe," she said. "As far as I know, he  doesn't own any rights to the name. It's now become a huge legal matter."  </P></p>

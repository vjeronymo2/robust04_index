			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Aznar Believes Early Election Is </F> Only Solution"]    [Text] Madrid -- People's Party Chairman Jose Maria Aznar  believes that the state of the nation debate did not enable the  government to restore confidence to the Spanish people or  society to believe that a resolute struggle against inflation  will really be undertaken now, because there is no reason to  believe that a government that has done nothing in so many years  will do so now; he therefore believes that the solution is an  early election, which he asserts will come soon.    In an interview on the Antena 3 television channel, the  People's Party chairman forecast that there will be an early  election soon because "a weak government, under suspicion, with  problems of corruption, unemployment, and daily pressures, is a  situation that I do not believe the public wants to last for  long."    However, Aznar continued to defend the correctness of the  stance of the People's Party, which called on Gonzalez to resign  in the debate, instead of submitting a censure motion. The main  opposition party's leader explained that the People's Party  eschewed this possibility "because it did not seem reasonable to  me, since an election was held just 10 months ago."    Aznar was pessimistic about the possibility that the state  of  the nation debate and the resolutions will serve to tackle  corruption, and stated that the experience of the past few years  shows that the struggle against corruption has been  unsuccessful. "Those who have temporized with corruption,  tolerated it, and protected it through their actions or  omissions," he said, "cannot combat corruption, and so I expect  very little from the measures that the government has proposed."    What the People's Party chairman does expect is that  "citizens will react in order to combat corruption," and he  added that "the powerlessness that many people feel will be  surmounted, but not because of what is going to be done by the  government, which will do nothing, but because most citizens may  have already decided that corruption must be combated,"  referring to the possiblity of changing this through the polls.  <H5>  Change of Attitudes </H5>   "The next national election will see what Spain needs most  --  a change of attitudes and of policy that will serve to guarantee  the Spanish people's future," he said. The People's Party  leader also took the opportunity to convey "calm and confidence"  to the Spanish people, "because, however difficult the  circumstances -- and they are -- Spain will move ahead, and we  must trust in ourselves and in the possibilities of our nation  and democracy, which have the means -- essentially through  alternation -- to surmount difficult circumstances."    Aznar doubted the government's will to combat corruption,  "because, during the state of the nation debate," he said,  "Felipe Gonzalez' credibility was put to the test" in the voting  on the People's Party proposal to set up a specific committee on  Filesa, which the Socialists opposed. He described as  "irresponsible" the Spanish Socialist Workers Party's trying to  "smear everything" and all the parties with corruption, although  he asserted that he has no objection to People's Party funding  being investigated. Aznar deems it urgent to combat corruption,  "because it harms democracy, and a blow has been dealt to the  institutions' credibility."    In addition, Abel Matutes, the People's Party candidate in  the European elections, stated in Ibiza that "Felipe Gonzalez  wishes to end corruption," and expressed his desire for "this  intention to succeed," although he specified that "there are  political responsibilities," according to EFE.</p>

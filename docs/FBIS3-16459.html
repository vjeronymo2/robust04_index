"Democratic Russia should not be guided by the heritage of  anti-popular bolshevik rule" -- this idea ran all through the  rally which is to be continued outside the Russian Embassy in  Yerevan. The rally organizers intend to present Russian  Ambassador Vladimir Stupishin with a statement to be delivered  to Russian authorities. The statement calls for cancellation of  what they consider to be "an anti-Armenian treaty".    According to the newspaper ANKAKHUTYUN (INDEPENDENCE)  published by the National Self-determination movement, since the  collapse of the former Soviet Union in 1991, Russia "has been  abandoning, revising and dumping to the dung-heap of history  international treaties immortalizing the crimes of bolshevik  diplomacy". Among these crimes the newspaper cited the 1921  Moscow treaty, which "re-adjusted" Armenia's boders and handed  over part of its territory to Turkey. By denouncing this  treaty, Russia would demonstrate its "new and just attitude  towards the shameful past, as well as confirm its current  political course in the transcaucasian region", the newspaper  believes.</p>

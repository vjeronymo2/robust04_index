			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SPOTLIGHT  </P> <P> Bongarra could be one of the Mustangs' key players when they play host to  Westmont in the NAIA District 3 championship match Saturday at 1 p.m.  </P> <P> With leading scorer Chris Palm (16 goals, 10 assists) suspended for the match  -- Palm was issued a red card in Tuesday's 7-1 win over Azusa Pacific --  Bongarra and teammate Randy Whitfield will need to pick up the scoring slack  for Master's (8-10-3).  </P> <P> Bongarra, a freshman from Buenos Aires, had two goals and an assist against  Azusa Pacific, bringing his season totals to seven goals and eight assists.  </P> <P> "He's an outstanding dribbler," Master's Coach Mark Schubert said. "He's very  deceiving. You think he's one place and he's really (in) another."  </P> <P> Master's, without Palm, will need all of Bongarra's tricks to beat Westmont.  The Warriors are the defending District 3 champion.  </P> <P> Ezekiel Bongarra: Master's  </P> <P> Soccer: Striker  </P> <P> Freshman: 5-11, 160 pounds  </P></p>

			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / UK Company News: ML launches Pounds 14m rescue rights issue ML HOLDINGS, the loss-making defence and aerospace group which has been the focus of bid speculation for the past year, yesterday launched a rescue rights issue to bolster its balance sheet. The company, which is 7 per cent held by the acquisitive TT Group, called for Pounds 14.3m by way of a 2-for-1 issue of 100.5m shares at 15p. ML closed steady last night at 18p. Mr Howard Grant, the new chief executive, said that without the rights proceeds ML would breach its financial covenants. He denied ML had been forced down the rights issue route by banks. 'We did not have a gun at our head,' he said. Yet the banks have made receipt of the rights proceeds conditional for renegotiated facilities. Previous financing arrangements were due to fall from Pounds 27m to Pounds 20m on April 1, but the banks have agreed to a three-year facility of up to Pounds 22m and an overdraft allowance of Pounds 3m. Without the proceeds, debt would be 'slightly higher' than the Pounds 27m reported last year. After the rights, gearing would fall from 114 per cent at the year-end to less than 50 per cent. Mr Grant said 1992-93 was 'a lost cause'. Mr John Bryson, finance director, said trading conditions remained similar to the first half, when the group reported a Pounds 1.48m loss. Mr Grant said ML expected a total of Pounds 8.4m in provisions and write-offs for the current year. The proceeds of the rights issue would reduce ML's debt to a 'more appropriate level and allow investment in the group's businesses.' This would include about Pounds 4m of infill acquisitions and some equipment renewal. The effects of recent restructuring would not be felt until next year. Mr Grant expected ML to reap a Pounds 2m benefit from the 18 per cent cut in jobs.</p>

			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Survey of Bermuda (9): Catastrophe a new dimension / A look at the recent swing towards specialisation in the insurance and reinsurance market INCREASING numbers of London brokers are preparing to make the long flight to Hamilton, Bermuda, this autumn, as the injection of more than Dollars 4bn into new catastrophe reinsurance companies adds a new dimension to Bermuda's insurance and reinsurance industry. Once known as the world's biggest centre for captive companies, the character of Bermuda's market has changed radically since the mid-1980s, with the launch of a series of well-capitalised - and so far profitable - specialised insurance and reinsurance companies. Bermuda already hosts some of the biggest players in a number of specialised markets. ACE and XL dominate the market for high level liability covers that protect manufacturing companies against large legal awards; the world's biggest oil companies buy coverage from OIL and other Bermuda-based mutuals; while Centre Re is a leading player in the financial reinsurance area. Local industry leaders now believe that Bermuda will consolidate its position as a leader in the catastrophe risk area. 'In the long haul, this will result in Bermuda becoming a very significant multi-line reinsurance centre,' says Walter Scott, president of ACE. Critics point to the failures of a number of reinsurance companies in the 1970s and early 1980s, implying that the current boom may also be shortlived. Bob Clements, president of Marsh &amp; McLennan Inc - the international broker and insurance services company that sponsored the formation of ACE and XL in the mid-1980s, Centre Re in 1988, and Mid Ocean, the biggest of Bermuda's catastrophe reinsurers last October - derides the view. 'It is popular for people who are threatened by Bermuda to say that these enormously well capitalised companies might pack their bags in the night and disappear,' says Mr Clements. 'But this has nothing to do with logic or fact. It is absolutely absurd.' Comparisons between the new wave of Bermudian reinsurers and those of the 1970s and 1980s are inappropriate, says Mr Clements, because the the growth which preceded the earlier failures was driven almost exclusively by tax considerations. During the early 1980s the the US tax authorities began to restrict the tax benefits available to captives. When these moves were reinforced by the courts, many US captive companies tried to preserve the tax advantages by underwriting third party business. But the weakly capitalised companies had insufficient resources to underwrite adequately and were soon overwhelmed by claims. 'They became a targetted as 'innocent' capacity,' says Mr Clements. By comparison, the new wave of reinsurers based in Bermuda since the mid-1980s are attracted by a range of other factors. Many of the new companies hold important positions in niche markets. ACE and XL were formed in the mid-1980s, when capacity in the traditional North American market for liability insurances had virtually dried up. Marsh &amp; McLennan, the international insurance broker, and JP Morgan, the merchant bank, sponsored the companies, which received capital from leading US corporations. Now, the two Bermudian companies meet many of the high level liability insurance needs of the pharmaceutical industry, for example. Together with OIL and TOPS, two companies formed by oil majors (again as a result of capacity shortages in traditional markets), ACE and XL also provide up to 50 per cent of the liability insurance needs of oil companies. The founders of Centre Re, formed in 1988, spotted an opportunity for providing so-called financial reinsurance products, covering against losses that have already occurred but have not been paid or against losses that are expected to occur in the future. Through one of its subsidiaries, CentreLine, Centre Re covers a number of syndicates at Lloyd's of London in a way that allows it to use its reserves against long-tail claims more effectively. In a similar way Marsh backed the launch of Mid Ocean in October last year, as capacity for catastrophe reinsurance in the London market shrank after a succession of severe weather losses between 1987 and 1993. Within a year investors - including some of the world's largest reinsurance companies, American International Group, Swiss Re and General Re - have followed suit, forming nine new reinsurance companies. Bermuda's attractions are likely to prove more durable. Its light and reputable regulation, ideally suited to the needs of insurers and reinsurers underwriting commercial business, is a key factor, especially from the point of view of US companies. The US system of state regulation - which proscribes policy terms and tightly controls rating - is designed to protect buyers of home and motor insurance. 'We are not talking about looking after the interests of Aunt Millicent. We have professionals on both sides of the deal,' says Mr Clements. The absence of taxes on either incomes or profits in Bermuda gives Bermudian reinsurers greater flexibility to build up reserves to cover future losses than their competitors in either North America or Europe. Bermuda is a convenient location geographically for internationally reinsurers who must - almost inevitably - transact business with direct insurers in the United States. The new wave of Bermudian companies all operate in ways that are likely to increase their advantages against their traditional competitors. They tend to deal in high margin business, with relatively few clients frequently on the basis of multi-year contracts. Their costs are low. ACE, for example, has an expense ratio (expenses as a percentage of premiums) of about 16-17 per cent (compared to between 28 and 30 per cent for traditional US insurers). XL, Centre Re and Mid Ocean all enjoy the same kind of cost advantages. Several factors could limit growth, not least the island's limited size and labour force. Already Bermuda's housing stock is under some strain with reinsurance chiefs prepared to pay up to Dollars 20,000 a month for executive apartments. Stephen Gluckstern, founder and chairman of Centre Re, predicts that although Bermuda will remain an important centre for niche business, it will be more difficult for it to grow as a fully-fledged 'full service' reinsurance centre, a view which explains Centre Re's recent decision to base its ZRC reinsurance subsidiary in New York. ZRC, unlike Centre Re or Centre Cat, will write a full range of reinsurance policies for American cedants, including quota share and proportional business. 'For niche business people will come out of their way to see you. But it must be harder to develop interests of a wider array of broker,' says Mr Gluckstern. Mr Gluckstern points to a tax factor which could also come into play. US insurers must pay excise tax of 4 per cent on all reinsurance premiums 'exported' out of the United States, a cost which can offset Bermuda's advantages on profits and income tax. Even so no one should write off Bermuda's prospects for further growth. Brian Hall, of Johnson &amp; Higgins, the international insurance brokers, has been based in Bermuda for nearly 30 years. 'After each development I always felt we had reached a new plateau. I can't expect the growth to continue. But it does.'  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        BERMUDA'S CATASTROPHY REINSURERS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Insurance company   Company sponsors     Est. capital      Est. start                                            (Dollars)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Mid Ocean Re        JP Morgan, Marsh          738m          Nov 1992                     &amp; McLennan  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Renaissance Re      USF &amp; G, Warburg,         140m          Jun 1993                     General Electric  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- IPC Re              AIG                       300m          Jun 1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Centre Cat          Centre Re,                400m          Sep 1993                     Morgan Stanley  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Tempest Re          General Re                482m          Sep 1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Global Capital Re   Goldman Sachs,            450m          Oct 1993                     Johnson &amp; Higgins                     Underwriters Re  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Compass Re          SCOR                      300m       4th qtr '93  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- LaSalle Re          Aon, CNA Financial,       500m       4th qtr '93                     Corporate Prtns  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Partner Re          Swiss Reinsurance,        750m       4th qtr '93                     John Head  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Insurance Partners  Centre Re                 400m       4th qtr '93  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Bank of Bermuda  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

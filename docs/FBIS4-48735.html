			<p>BFN     [Text] President Chiluba has said that southern Africa  appears to be heading for greater regional development now that  South Africa which stood as a major obstacle to peace is  democratically free. Speaking at the second military investiture  ceremony at which he awarded more than 200 senior members of the  Zambia Army and Air Force with medals, Mr. Chiluba said there  was now need for Africa to strive to bring lasting peace to  Angola and Mozambique. President Chiluba paid tribute to  members of the Armed Forces who have participated in United  Nations peacekeeping operations in Mozambique. He said because  of the good record the soldiers have, Zambia has now been asked  by the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity to  contribute troops to Rwanda and Angola.</p>

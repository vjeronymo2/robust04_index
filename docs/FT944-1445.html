			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Banks agree three day extension for Stanhope Stanhope yesterday won a three-day breathing space as banks agreed to extend the property developer's borrowing facilities until Thursday. The company's Pounds 140m loans were due for repayment at 3.30pm yesterday. All 16 banks in its lending syndicate agreed to an extension early in the afternoon and a terse Stock Exchange announcement was issued just minutes before the deadline. Stanhope, headed by Mr Stuart Lipton, will use the breathing space to answer detailed questions from the banks relating to refinancing proposals received last week. If it can satisfy the banks, led by Barclays and advised by Barclays de Zoete Wedd, a three month extension of the borrowing facility could follow. This would give Stanhope sufficient time to put one of the rescue packages into practice. However, sources close to the negotiations said that some banks still needed to be finally convinced that refinancing would be a better option than receivership. The main refinancing plans come from British Land, the property investment company headed by Mr John Ritblat, and Postel, the post office and telecommunications pension fund. The Postel plan envisages a rights issue of up to Pounds 250m, underwritten by the pension fund and other institutional investors. Stanhope could then partially repay its banks and buy the 50 per cent it does not already own of Broadgate Properties, which owns much of the Broadgate and Ludgate office developments in the City of London. The other half of Broadgate Properties is owned by Rosehaugh, Stanhope's former development partner which went into receivership in 1991. British Land has offered the banks a cash-and-paper deal for Stanhope's existing half share in Broadgate Properties. While both proposals were revised late last week to offer better terms to Stanhope's lenders, the banks would have to write off up to 20p in the pound on their loans. Stanhope has also asked the banks to consider a debt standstill of up to three years, at the end of which they would receive full repayment. The company believes it has found an investor willing to provide working capital during a standstill period in return for an equity stake.</p>

			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 3-A GIRLS;  </P> <P> INJURIES, AGOURA STOP CANYON, 2-0  </P> <P> In the end, the inevitable far outweighed the improbable.  </P> <P> The Canyon High School girls' soccer team, having lost its top two players to  injury early in the game, lost, 2-0, to top-seeded Agoura in the Southern  Section 3-A final Saturday at Gahr High School in Cerritos.  </P> <P> Canyon, the sixth-seeded team, had its biggest challenge of the season going  into Saturday's match. Agoura (26-0) had set a Southern Section record with 175  goals this season, and its defense had allowed only six goals.  </P> <P> So when Canyon goalkeeper Keri Erkenbrack went down in the game's opening  minute, Comanche fans had reason to worry. Erkenbrack, who was kicked in the  head while trying to stop a shot, was taken to Pioneer Hospital in Artesia for  X-rays and observation. A mild concussion was the preliminary diagnosis.  </P> <P> Less than 20 minutes later, Christa Ramirez, Canyon's scoring leader, limped  off the field with a sore left knee. Using a variety of taping techniques,  Ramirez tried several times to play, but could muster little more than 50% of  her usual firepower and didn't take a shot in the match.  </P> <P> Ramirez, who along with Erkenbrack also starred on Canyon's basketball team  this season, admitted that playing both sports in one season might have led to  the knee injury, one that she has yet to have checked by a physician.  </P> <P> "I guess I'm lucky it happened in the end of the season," Ramirez, a senior,  said. "I can't be too disappointed. We've done everything we wanted to this  year."  </P> <P> Canyon, which had never advanced beyond the second round of the playoffs,  played impressively despite its injuries, especially in the first half as it  out shot Agoura, 7-4. With just seconds remaining in the half, Canyon's Keri  Springer took a straight shot from five yards out, but Agoura fullback Kelly  MacDonald reached up with her hands and swatted the ball away. No hand ball was  called.  </P></p>

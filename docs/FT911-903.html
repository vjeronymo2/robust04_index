			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Egypt's Gulf troop pull-out seen as snub IN A surprise snub to Arab allies in the Gulf, Egypt said yesterday that it would pull its troops out of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. The 38,000-strong Egyptian force, together with a smaller Syrian contingent which also joined the anti-Iraq coalition, had been seen as the nucleus of a future regional Arab defence force. The policy reversal, announced by President Hosni Mubarak, reflected growing Egyptian disaffection with its wealthy allies since the signing on March 6 of a security agreement between Egypt, Syria and six Gulf states. The vaguely worded defence pact had suggested the continued stationing of Syrian and Egyptian troops in exchange for Gulf money. Egyptian officials then appeared frustrated by the lack of progress in ironing out details. Obstacles included Iran's anger at being kept out, Kuwait's preference for western troop support and differences over the nature of the aid. Gulf countries offered to create a Dollars 10bn aid fund, but then suggested it only offer finance to private business. Gulf leaders recently indicated that they favour a larger Iranian role in security. Having succeeded Iraq as the strongest Arab state, Egypt opposes the participation of non-Arab regional powers such as Iran and Turkey. Mr Mubarak played down inter-Arab differences, however, insisting that the pull-out decision was taken a month ago when it was felt the troops had completed their mission. He said the full withdrawal could take up to three months.</p>

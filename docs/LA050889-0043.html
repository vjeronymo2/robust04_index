			<p><P> May 8, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> French Premier Michel Rocard said elections in the South Pacific territory of  New Caledonia will proceed as planned, reversing an earlier decision to  postpone the balloting because of the slaying of two independence leaders.  Rocard was among 5,000 who attended the funerals in the capital of Noumea of  Jean-Marie Tjibaou, leader of the Kanak Socialist National Liberation Front,  and Tjibaou's top assistant, Yeiwene Yeiwene. The two were killed on the island  of Ouvea on Thursday by Djubelly Wea, a hard-line separatist opposed to  Tjibaou's moderate policies. Wea was killed by Tjibaou's bodyguards after the  attack.  </P></p>

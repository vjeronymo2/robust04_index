			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Swans takeover deal in jeopardy The survival prospects of Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder in receivership, dimmed yesterday as the Ministry of Defence disclosed that there was a problem with a contract transfer deal. The MoD said the disagreement on the price at which the company's sole contract should be transferred to its only prospective purchaser was a 'major obstacle'. The chances of a sale of Swans to French-based Soffia/ Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie depend on a deal in which CMN would take on Swans' frigate contract from the MoD and subcontract it to the receiver, Price Waterhouse. Price Waterhouse has said that unless CMN starts paying Swans' technical and design team by next Wednesday they will be made redundant immediately. This would effectively end the company's chances of bidding for future work and being sold as a going concern. Yesterday the MoD said CMN was unwilling to negotiate on the price for the transfer of the contract for the three Type 23 frigates that Swans was fitting out when it went into receivership in May last year. The receivership followed its failure to win an MoD helicopter carrier order. The MoD said: 'Price is the major obstacle and they are unwilling to negotiate on price.' It added there was 'little benefit' to the MoD, the defence budget or the taxpayer in CMN's 'very conditional' agreement, but it remained ready to negotiate. CMN also had to satisfy a number of requirements, the MoD said, including financial and performance guarantees. Last month the MoD and CMN agreed a price of Pounds 57.7m for the contract for the three frigates. Since two have been completed and handed over, between 10 per cent and 15 per cent of this sum, relating to the last frigate due for completion in late October, would actually change hands. Mr Fred Henderson, CMN's lead negotiator, said yesterday that the MoD wanted to drop the price to Pounds 57m. He said: 'We'd say the key obstacle is the MoD's unwillingness to go through with the price it agreed on July 19.' He has called for an urgent meeting with the MoD but said he was not very hopeful about CMN's chances of buying Swans.</p>

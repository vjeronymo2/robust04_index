			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Macedonia misses aid target Macedonia failed yesterday to win enough aid to meet its mounting foreign debts. Although Denmark, the Netherlands, France and Switzerland pledged an undisclosed sum to help finance imports, Mr Michael Wiehen, a World Bank director who chaired the first meeting of the newly formed aid-to-Macedonia consortium, said the donors' overall offer was 'quite inadequate in terms of what, in cash terms, Macedonia needs to regularise its relations with its creditors'. Mr Ljube Trpeski, Macedonia's minister for international financial affairs, said that of his country's total Dollars 1.1bn (Pounds 720m) debt, Dollars 194m was owed to the Paris Club of official creditors and Dollars 514m to commercial banks. Mr Wiehen said Macedonia would need to pay Paris Club creditors Dollars 50m and institutions such as the European Investment Bank Dollars 45m, even to get a rescheduling deal from them.</p>

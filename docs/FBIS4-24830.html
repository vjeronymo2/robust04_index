			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bear Li] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 1 (CNA) -- Clashes between National  Assembly members of the ruling Kuomintang [KMT] and main  opposition Democratic Progressive Party [DPP] turned worse  Wednesday [1 Jun], totally paralyzing the morning session.    Two DPP deputies were slightly injured during the fighting  and sent to hospitals for treatment, the DPP said.    Disputing the quorum standard for starting the first-reading  session to consider proposed amendments to the constitution,  deputies from the two parties have engaged in free-for-alls  every day since last Friday, kicking, punching, and chasing each  other around the conference hall in the otherwise serene Taipei  suburb of Yangmingshan.    The DPP has been insisting that the quorum must be  two-thirds  of the deputies, but the KMT has said one-third of members would  be sufficient to proceed with the session.    No longer than one minute after the morning session started  Wednesday, DPP deputies again rushed the podium and staged a  sit-in, as they have done in previous days.    While KMT deputy Kuo Po-tsun, who was the day's chairman,  stood on a table in an attempt to announce the commencement of  proceedings, DPP members were shouting and whistling in protest.    Angered by the tactics of the DPP members, several KMT  deputies rushed to the podium to remove them, which resulted in  several shoving, kicking, and wrestling matches.    The two parties, however, later reached agreement in  negotiations between their whips to appeal the quorum-standard  question to a court of grand justices. The settlement enabled  the National Assembly to go ahead with its afternoon session.</p>

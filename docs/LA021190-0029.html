			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UCLA GUEST HOUSE MEETS PATIENT NEEDS  </P> <P> As a volunteer member of UCLA Medical Center's Board of Advisors and chairman  of its facilities committee, I have been involved for some time in the planning  for the medical center's proposed patient-family guest house featured in your  Jan. 18 article. Having carefully reviewed the proposal, I believe that this  facility is very important in order that the UCLA Medical Center may meet the  humanistic needs of its patients.  </P> <P> It is not a hotel, but a patient-family guest house. It will provide unique  services to meet the special needs of those patients and their families who  must travel great distances to receive care at UCLA Medical Center. Many of  these people cannot afford to stay in a local hotel close to the medical  center. Additionally, these people are uprooted from their regular routine  during a most stressful time of illness, and the patient-family guest house  would offer special counseling and support services.  </P> <P> I urge the community to support UCLA Medical Center's efforts to improve the  quality of life for its patients and their families in the proposed  patient-family guest house.  </P> <P> GLORIA GRIFFIN  </P> <P> member, UCLA Medical Center  </P> <P> Board of Advisors  </P></p>

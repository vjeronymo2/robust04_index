			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / International Company News: Olympic swallows its medicine - The Greek airline needs time to regain its strength The Dr54bn (Dollars 219m) capital injection for Olympic Airways from the state, approved last week by the European Commission, offers the loss-making Greek national carrier what may be its last chance of survival. The conditions attached to the aid, which includes a debt write-off amounting to Dr491bn, are stringent but considerably more generous than those first proposed. Olympic has managed to retain its profitable monopoly of ground handling operations at Greek airports, holding off a challenge from several big European airlines, while it carries out a three-year restructuring plan. It is being allowed to keep open its loss-making long-haul routes to New York and Sydney, which mainly serve diaspora Greek communities. These routes are seen as essential for maintaining links with about 4m Greeks living overseas. However, the carrier's future depends as much on severing links with the government - which sets ticket prices, approves loans to the airline and appoints its senior management - and improving service to customers as on cost-cutting to reduce operating losses projected at Dr24bn this year. 'The debt write-off will make a big difference to Olympic's financial position, but the real difficulty will come in implementing change in management practices,' said Mr Stefanos Romaios, a senior Olympic official. Greece's high interest rates, together with penalty charges amounting to about 3 per cent a month on overdue government loans, last year swelled financial charges to about Dr123bn, equivalent to 90 per cent of the airline's overall losses for 1993. Under the airline's restructuring plan, prepared in co-operation with Avmark, the international aviation consultants, Olympic should show a net profit of Dr14bn next year. This should rise to Dr30bn in 1997, equipping Olympic to face competition both in ground handling and on domestic routes to 25 Greek islands at the end of the following year. Cost-cutting, directed mainly at labour costs, which account for almost 50 per cent of the airline's operating outlays, is to be the priority. A two-year wage freeze, together with a voluntary retirement programme for 1,900 of 9,900 employees and more flexible working rules, should reduce labour costs by more than 40 per cent in the next two years. Asset disposals, including the sale of one Boeing 747 and the return to lessors of four Airbus A300s, will reduce the airline's fleet to 31 passenger jets, while additional savings will come from cutting long-haul routes to Tokyo and Chicago. The airline's trade unions accept that reforms are needed to prevent Olympic shutting down. But details of the plan agreed with the Commission still await approval. The pilots' union, for example, must be persuaded to agree to suspension of seniority-linked holidays and a reduction in medical benefits. 'The unions must be brought on board immediately if restructuring is to succeed,' says one local analyst. 'Because successive governments changed the airline's top management so frequently, the unions now in effect control Olympic's day-to-day operations.' Under the terms of the Commission's approval for Olympic's capital increase, the three tranches of funding, due to start with a Dr19bn capital injection in 1995, will be released only if the airline keeps to the restructuring timetable. Moreover, the carrier will not be entitled to any more state funding. Reform will mean cutting through the carrier's management layers, considered a crucial step towards eliminating government interference in Olympic's operations and introducing flexible decision-making. Outside consultants are to be appointed to oversee changes in planning and organisation. Freeing ticket prices and improving marketing, including co-operative agreements with other international airlines, will help to lift revenues. Olympic faces increasingly aggressive competition from two new private Greek airlines and charter operators, which now carry 66 per cent of international traffic to Greece, mainly in the summer months. However, the Commission's insistence that Olympic should not increase its total seat capacity for the next three years will place constraints on growth. The airline sees its future in expanding routes to eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union and upgrading services in the eastern Mediterranean, where it is the leading regional carrier. 'Olympic is being put in a plaster cast for the next three years,' Mr Romaios said. 'It should be cured when it comes out, but will it be strong enough to survive in a much more competitive environment?'</p>

State Water Quality Standards and State Certification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since state waters are involved in the proposed general permit area, the provisions of Section 401 of the Act apply. In accordance with 40 CFR 124.10(c)(1), public notice of the draft permit has been provided to the State of Alaska agencies having jurisdiction over fish, shellfish, and wildlife resources (see section II.C. above).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F.

Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA has reviewed the requirements imposed on regulated facilities in this draft general permit under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 USC 3501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Most of the information collection requirements have already been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in submissions made for the NPDES permit program under the provisions of the Clean Water Act. In addition, the environmental monitoring requirements pursuant to Section 403(c) of the Clean Water Act in Part II.B.4 of this permit are similar to the monitoring requirements that were approved by OMB for the previously issued Beaufort Sea II and Chukchi Sea general permits (September 28, 1988, 53 FR 37846) and the modification of the Beaufort Sea II NPDES general permit (September 27, 1989, 54 FR 39574). The final general permit will explain how the information collection requirements respond to any OMB or public comments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> H.

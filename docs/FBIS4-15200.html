			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Video report by correspondent Aleksandr Khabarov; including </F> recorded comments by Vasiliy Svirin, Russian envoy to the  Russian-Estonian talks]    [Text] Today's round of talks between Russia and Estonia  almost ended in a diplomatic squabble. Vasiliy Svirin, the head  of the Russian delegation, maintains that the Estonian diplomats:    [Svirin] ...tried to accuse the Russian delegation of  artificially seeking some kind of reasons that would allow  Russia not to withdraw its troops from Estonia. The invention  and groundlessness of such conclusions, I am convinced, are  well-known.    [Khabarov] Russia really is refusing to give Estonia a  detailed schedule for the withdrawal of its troops, but only  because the Estonian side is not prepared to simultaneously sign  an agreement on the social security of military pensioners  remaining in Estonia. The talks are also barely making progress  on other issues as well.    [Svirin] Today we were unable to initial a single document.    [Khabarov] The Estonian delegation was once again asked to  begin discussions on the land border with Russia. If this does  not happen Moscow intends to unilaterally reinforce its borders.  Russian Foreign Ministry representatives would like to hear a  reply to this warning at the next, 19th round of talks.    According to preliminary information the next meeting  between  Russian and Estonian diplomats will take place at the beginning  of May in Tallinn. So, if this round of talks has finished like  the majority of the others in failure, then the Russian  diplomats can be sure of one thing at least -- that rooms have  already been booked for them in a Tallinn hotel.</p>

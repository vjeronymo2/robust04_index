			<p>Language: <F P=105> Afrikaans </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Professor Willem Kleynhans, the reputed political  commentator and election expert, warns in this report that no  nation or party in South Africa can at this juncture be ready  for an election for a unitary government. He warns that  disaster awaits South Africa if the wretched election is not  called off.    The so-called "mother of all elections in South Africa,"  which, due to an overwhelmingly euphoric reason, has to take  place in an attempt to come out of apartheid, will destroy South  Africa if it is not called off, Kleynhans said.    All indications are that less than 50 percent of the alleged  22 million voters will vote in this election.    The NP [National Party], IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party], ANC  [African National Congress], and the SACP [South African  Communist Party] are, according to their own admissions,  generally unprepared for the election.    The Conservative Party is on record as saying that it will  not take part in the damned election, while the patriotic sector  of the Afrikaner/Boer nation unanimously rejected on 29 January  any participation in the election.    The Zulus and the Tswanas are determined they are not going  to vote.    The parties keen on participation have already proved that  they could never -- within three months -- be able to educate  the 9 million illiterate voters and the 17 million voters who  have never voted before. Besides, they will not even be able to  reach all the new voters.  <H5>  Victimization </H5>   De Klerk said his target is at least 3 million black voters.  To date he cannot in any way rely on any black voters, because  as soon as the communists come forward with full scale  victimization -- as has in the past been done without exception  in every African country -- de Klerk will probably not even get  a single black vote.    The ANC has held several mass meetings, but has as yet not  reached the millions of rural blacks through those meetings.    The overwhelming majority of potential black voters still  have to be "taught" to go to the polling booths.    At this stage, rural blacks have no election machinery that  encourages and organizes them to vote.    The mother of all elections must take place because of a  euphoric consideration to leave apartheid behind, but without  the very important prior education of the illiterate portion --  namely, 9 million members -- of the voters' corps.    The chances are already 100 percent that the percentage of  people voting will be very low, and this will affect the  credibility aspect of the election.    I anticipate the result to be so bad that it will shock the  entire world.    At the same time the black voters will be so shocked by the  election results that they will most probably veer away  permanently from the elected government and rather resort --  like elsewhere in Africa -- to anarchy to achieve their  objectives.  <H5>  Voter Education Fails </H5>   All so-called "voter education" [preceding two words in  English] programs have so far been entirely unsuccessful in  improving the political knowledge of the nine million  illiterates.    In any case, this education does not bring over a single  convincing message to the millions of blacks which will satisfy  what they are striving for.  <H5>  Call Off Election </H5>   De Klerk's only logical step, which he can still take in the  midst of the prevailing anarchy, is to call off the election,  otherwise CHAOS will be the result of the election and not peace  as has been promised.  <H5>  Unprepared </H5>   The NP is currently further from preparedness than a year  ago. Wherever de Klerk goes, ANC supporters turn the meetings  into chaotic gatherings.    In his quest to please voters, de Klerk has chased away the  NP's white supporters or he has made them lose interest.    The days when tens of thousands of volunteers helped to  campaign for the NP are no more.    The NP's best chance to recruit blacks is in the rural areas  where the ANC is not making an impact.    De Klerk has invited foreign observers to South Africa to  show them how he is phasing out apartheid. They must see for  themselves "how a miracle is being achieved in a general  election in South Africa." [passage in quotes published in  English]    The outside world has been invited to be spectators of the  big farce of an election.    If the election is not called off, de Klerk will learn the  hard way how stupid he was to try and force 17 million voters,  who have no idea what elections are about, into a unitary  election.  <H5>  Disaster </H5>   Of course it will spell disaster for de Klerk and company to  cancel the election.    But it will bring a greater disaster to them if they go  ahead  with the election.    Because for the blacks, who are supposed to benefit from the  election, the latter will bring unprecedented misery, Kleynhans  said.</p>

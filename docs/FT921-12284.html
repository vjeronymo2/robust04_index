			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / UK Company News: BT advances results date BRITISH Telecommunications is bringing forward the announcement of its third quarter results to coincide with the publication on Thursday of the consultative document on BT regulation by Oftel, the industry regulator. The publication of the document starts the process of reviewing BT's prices during which Oftel will have to decide whether the group's profits are 'reasonable' and how much its prices should be regul-ated. BT has come under increasing scrutiny for its high profitability which is seen to be supported by unnecessarily high prices. The announcement of the third quarter results is being made two weeks earlier than originally scheduled so that BT will be able to put its case regarding its profitability without being hampered by Stock Exchange rules which would have prevented it from commenting on its financial performance for eight weeks before a results announcement.</p>

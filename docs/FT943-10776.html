			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Observer: De Savary tries again While Britain's grander yachties graced the lawns of the Royal Yacht Squadron for Cowes Week, a prominent but decidely unclubbable UK yachtsman has been trying to catch their attention from across the Atlantic. America's Cup challengers are normally invited to join the Squadron, but Peter de Savary's multi-million endeavours at the race have cut no ice with the nobs at Cowes Castle, who heartily dislike almost everything about the entrepreneur. Now he has decided to challenge them at sea. The occasion presents itself courtesy of the New York Yacht Club, which, as part of its 150th birthday celebrations, is unveiling another international sailing trophy. The first race will be held off Newport, Rhode Island, in 1996 with a new class of 60ft yachts, crewed strictly by amateurs. After almost two years of discussions, the NYYC had secured the participation of the Royal Yacht Squadron. But flag officers were startled earlier this week when De Savary, on holiday afloat his yacht Carabana, inquired whether another British challenge would be acceptable. He got the green light. Clearly not unduly deflated by the problems of part of his business empire earlier this year, De Savary has promised to return to the UK and drum up the Dollars 1.5m that he will need. But he can assemble the best amateur team in the world and beat everyone on the high seas. Membership of the RYS - or of the NYYC - never had anything to do with sporting ability.</p>

			<p>920116 FT  16 JAN 92 / Korean war-time memories sour Miyazawa mission MR Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister, plans to call for a 'future-oriented partnership' with South Korea, during a visit to Seoul due to begin today. However, several issues stand in his way. For the past few weeks the Japanese government has been confronted with claims that at least 100,000 Korean women were forced to work in Second World War military brothels, the so-called 'comfort women'. Tokyo had claimed this was a private enterprise and no documents existed proving a clear relationship between the military and the brothels. However, after several documents were produced last weekend supporting the allegations, Mr Miyazawa said: 'It is undeniable that the Imperial Japanese army was involved in the recruitment of these women and the management of these facilities. I wish to express my apologies and remorse to all those who underwent indescribable suffering.' But the damage had been done, with Koreans feeling insulted by Japan's reluctance to admit responsibility for its brutal occupation of the Korean peninsula. In Seoul, the Japanese leader will also be under pressure to reduce his country's rapidly expanding bilateral trade surplus, although Mr Miyazawa would like to concentrate on broader issues. He is scheduled to address the South Korean parliament and plans to suggest the two countries play an important role in solving regional and global problems. The prime minister will have to reassure his hosts that Japan is proceeding cautiously in its talks with North Korea, which is keen to improve economic links with Tokyo. The bilateral trade deficit - a source of increasing concern in Seoul - has expanded greatly since the mid-1980s. In 1991, according to Korean Ministry of Trade and Industry estimates, the trade deficit with Japan widened to Dollars 8.8bn (Pounds 4.91bn), an increase from Dollars 6bn in 1990 and about 90 per cent of Korea's total trade gap. Korean economic officials will request tariff reductions of up to 50 per cent on 16 of Korea's main export items, including textiles and footwear. Korea will also ask for sharp increases in export quotas on chemical and steel products and will demand improved access for Korean construction companies. However, officials in Seoul are not too optimistic about prospects for their demands. 'Japan has told us so many times that it will help increase Korean imports, but it never turns words into action,' said one official at the Ministry of Trade and Industry in Seoul. 'They bow over to help the Americans, but they do little for us,' he added. A serious obstacle to improved economic relations is the structural nature of the deficit. In particular, Korean manufacturing companies continue to depend on Japanese components, capital equipment and machinery. At a time of industrial restructuring in Korea - undertaken in an attempt to offset the impact of rising wage costs through automation and more efficient production - the result has been a surge of imports of Japanese capital goods. Imports of these goods are expected to see further strong growth this year. And with continued weakness in Korean exports to Japan, South Korea's trade ministry is expecting a widening of the bilateral deficit to about Dollars 10bn.</p>

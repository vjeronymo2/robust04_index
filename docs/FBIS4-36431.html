			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati by </F> Nur-al-Huda Zaki in Cairo; date not given -- first paragraph is  introduction]    [Text] The Iranian foreign minister views the discussions  held by the foreign ministers of the Nonaligned Movement [NAM]  in Cairo as a positive development in the progress of NAM. He  says the countries of the South and the Third World realized at  the conference that the strengthening of NAM will be in their  interest. I asked him: What role is left to the movement now  that the Eastern camp has collapsed? He replied: It is true  that the Eastern camp has collapsed and gone, but subservience  continues. Nonalignment means non-subservience. If we believe  in this idea, we will notice that because one of the blocs  collapsed, the other bloc is trying to strengthen its control  and hegemony. Iran strongly believes in the need to maintain  NAM.    [Zaki] Mr. Minister, you met with Egyptian Foreign Minister  'Amr Musa. What did you discuss?    [Velayati] We had a good dialogue with the Egyptian side.  There is increasing understanding between Iran and Egypt on the  need to cooperate on regional and international issues.    [Zaki] Did you discuss the exchange of ambassadors between  Cairo and Tehran?    [Velayati] We did not discuss that.    [Zaki] Did you touch on the relations between Tehran and  Khartoum?    [Velayati] We did not discuss that subject either.    [Zaki] Have you discussed Egypt's accusations that Iran  supports the extremist Islamic trends in Egypt?    [Velayati] We discussed the subject of the Islamic trends as  a whole and as a general principle. But the accusations against  Iran were not discussed, and were not raised in the first place.    [Zaki] But what is your comment on these accusations?    [Velayati] In general and in principle, the revival of  Islamic values and thought cannot be ignored by anyone; nobody  can or wants to ignore this fact. The signs of such revival are  clear everywhere, so much so that even the pro-secularism in the  Islamic world are now introducing their talk with "in the name  of God, the merciful, the compassionate." I personally have  seen this. I have also noticed that the number of Muslim women  who wear Islamic dress has increased in recent years. This is  not a sign of extremism, but the Western countries are trying to  stop this trend. When Muslims return to their religion and  somebody says that Iran forced them to do so, then this is an  insult to them.    [Zaki] Excuse me, we are not talking about Islam as a  religion and a way to worship. We are discussing political  Islam and Iran's position on the extremist Islamic groups that  are now confronting the civil authorities in some Arab  countries. What is Iran's position toward those groups?    [Velayati] Islam is a religion of politics, and without  politics there is no Islam. Those who argue against our opinion  are politicizing Islam but in their own way. We do not believe  Islam is the religion of staying in mosques. The Prophet, may  God's peace and blessings be upon him, established a practical  and actual government. If we want to follow the Prophet's way,  we cannot tell those who govern in Mecca: You govern and we  pray. But if we want a new Islam, then that is a different  story.    That the Islamic countries are now returning to Islam  reflects Muslims' disappointment with Western values. Iran did  not tell Muslims to [sentence incomplete as published].    [Zaki] But some governments are actually accusing Iran of  supporting internal unrest in their countries.    [Velayati] When governments of some countries face problems  on the domestic scene, the easiest way is to accuse foreign  quarters.    [Zaki] Is there a relationship between Britain's position  toward Iran and Iran's Islamist policy?    [Velayati] Britain's position toward us is certainly linked  to the Islamic position. The Islamic countries are increasingly  worried at Britain's stance toward the Muslims in Bosnia. The  Islamic majority in the world is convinced that Britain's bad  position toward the Bosnian Muslims has led things to the edge  of tragedy and prevented a tangible solution to the problem.    [Zaki] Why did you not play an effective role--you are a  major Islamic country?    [Velayati] Concerning Bosnia, we did all we could. Iran was  behind all pro-Bosnia moves in the United Nations, the Islamic  Conference Organization, and the Nonaligned Movement.    [Zaki] I am talking about military assistance.    [Velayati] I will quote the Bosnian president: "Iran  extended all possible assistance, and proposed sending military  aid. After that, THE WASHINGTON POST reported that Iran is  providing military assistance to Bosnia..." and the  responsibility lies with the newspaper." [quotation marks,  ellipses as published]    [Zaki] Mr. Minister: You have met with the Iraqi foreign  minister. Are we going to see a promotion of Iranian-Iraqi  relations?    [Velayati] The issue with Iraq is different. We are engaged  in complex [murakkabah] talks; we are moving toward reducing  problems and then solving them.    [Zaki] When will you visit Baghdad?    [Velayati] After a month, or perhaps 40 days.</p>

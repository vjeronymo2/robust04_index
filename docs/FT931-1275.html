			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Airlift of Bosnia wounded halted by Serb shelling FRENCH and British helicopters, which yesterday started to evacuate Moslem civilians from the besieged enclave of Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia, were forced to suspend their operations a few hours later because of heavy Serb shelling of the town. The mission was halted shortly after two British helicopters had evacuated two Canadian soldiers of the United Nations peacekeeping force who had been wounded by Serb gunfire. Earlier, Serb shells had killed a civilian only minutes after three French helicopters had taken off with 21 wounded Moslems on board. Altogether, three people were killed and at least six, including the two Canadians, were wounded in the shelling of the town. The British Sea King helicopters had flown into Srebrenica under fire but were able to leave unharmed, in spite of the fact that the Serb bombardment appeared to be deliberately directed at the town football pitch which was being used as the landing zone. The Serb action was described as 'the ultimate in despicable behaviour' by Brigadier Roddy Cordy-Simpson, the British chief-of-staff at the UN Bosnia command. UN officials immediately lodged a stiff protest with the Serb military, which had undertaken to observe a ceasefire to allow the airlift to succeed. Srebrenica has been under siege from the Serbs since the beginning of the Bosnian civil war last April and, earlier this month, inhabitants were reported by UN officials to be dying at the rate of 30 a day. Under a deal worked out by General Philippe Morillon, the French UN commander, Serb leaders had authorised the evacuation of sick and wounded people on condition that 46 Serb inhabitants of Tuzla, a Moslem-held town in northern Bosnia, would also be evacuated. The Serb forces are only a few kilometres away from Srebrenica and it is feared that they are preparing for a final assault.</p>

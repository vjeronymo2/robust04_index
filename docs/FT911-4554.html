			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Maxwell floats MGN in style MR ROBERT Maxwell yesterday launched a lavish marketing campaign for the upcoming flotation of Mirror Group Newspapers of which he is chairman. Mr Maxwell, speaking amid flashing cameras at a packed press presentation in MGN's Holborn headquarters, declared he was offering the chance to invest in a 'great company'. The press conference was called for the publication of the so-called Pathfinder Prospectus - the final one, but without the pricing details  - which will form the basis on which shares are marketed to institutions. The sale will involve just under 50 per cent of the equity and aims to raise about Pounds 250m. To maximise demand, the shares are to be spread thinly between institutions in the UK, North America and continental Europe, and private investors. The prospectus shows that MGN's profits have consistently risen over the past three years as it has reaped the benefits of investments in new equipment and extensive reorganisations. These, Mr Maxwell said, were now largely complete. Pre-tax profits improved to Pounds 53.3m from Pounds 31.9m during the year to end-December 1990, on sales up to Pounds 445m from Pounds 412.3m. The operating margin improved from 15.8 to 19.8 per cent. The document shows that group debt before flotation proceeds amounts to about Pounds 400m. In addition, MGN has about Pounds 180m of obligations under finance leases. Mr Maxwell stressed yesterday that against an adverse trading profit MGN had improved operating profits in the first quarter of this year. ted flotation value of MGN compares with the Pounds 113m purchase price paid to Reed International in 1984. MGN will now be taking soundings with institutional investors before deciding the flotation issue price, to be announced on April 30. Private investors, who will be required to put up at least around Pounds 250, will have until May 9 to return application forms. The basis of allocation is to be announced on May 14 prior to commencement of stock market dealings, scheduled for May 21. Samuel Montagu is financial adviser to the sale and Smith New Court stockbroker. Salomon Brothers International is handling the international side.

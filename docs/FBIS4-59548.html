			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Brother Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar,  the House of Representatives speaker, has stressed that the  House has no reservations whatsoever about the Yemeni Socialist  Party and its activities in the Yemeni arena, but the House  stands against the rebels in the party's leadership. He  explained that members of the Socialist Party are still  performing their activities inn the House of Representatives.    This emerged in the news conference the brother House of  Representatives Speaker held today, 15 May, which marks the  passage of one year since the first session of the elected House  of Representatives and the election of its speakership office.  He said this is a dear occasion [words indistinct] embodied in  27 April 1993 through which the legitimate and Constitutional  institutions were born. He stressed that all of this was the  product of democracy in which we believe and to which we adhere,  regardless of attempts by those who are trying to circumvent the  results of the elections. He said our Yemeni people adhere to  unity and democracy because this is their fate and future, and  because they emanate from Islam. Therefore, he said, they will  stand by them and protect them against all secessionists.    The brother House of Representatives speaker explained that  Saudi Arabia and other fraternal and friendly states support  legitimacy and view the issue as one between the state and  rebels. He noted that this does not mean they (?hesitate) to  exert efforts, individually and through the Arab League. He  said his visit to Saudi Arabia yielded good results and that the  ties between the two countries are eternal and strong.  Therefore, we have to exchange views with our brothers to put  them in the picture. Additionally, the visit fell within the  context of strengthening and activating these ties.    He explained the interaction by Arab capitals, both near and  far, with the events in the Yemeni arena emanates from the  brotherly (?ties) and the desire to stop this bloodshed.    The brother House of Representatives Speaker praised the  stand of all Arab brothers who exerted and are exerting efforts  and are showing concern for [words indistinct] the efforts of  King Husayn and his great and effective roles to contain the  crisis since it started. The king's position, al-Ahmar said,  was the position of the brother who is concerned about his  brothers. [passage omitted; covered in referent item and  containing indistinct words]</p>

			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RYAN'S FANS STILL FAITHFUL;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: WELL-WISHERS IN ORANGE COUNTY CHEER ON TEXAS PITCHER AS HE TRIED TO  WIN NO. 300.  </P> <P> When Bill Madden was a student at UC Santa Barbara in the '70s, he used to hop  in a friend's two-seater, fly to Orange County and drive to Anaheim Stadium on  the nights Nolan Ryan pitched for the Angels.  </P> <P> Madden still sometimes flies into American League cities to watch Ryan pitch.  But usually, you can find him with other Ryan fans in front of a television at  his favorite bar, Silky Sullivan's in Fountain Valley, which always shows the  Texas Rangers games whenever Ryan's pitching.  </P> <P> And why not? Madden owns the bar, and his establishment has become the  headquarters for Orange County's unofficial Nolan Ryan fan club.  </P> <P> "When we opened up here, I just started showing Nolan Ryan games, and word got  around," Madden said. "He's the kind of hero you can really get behind. He's a  real family man, he's never tried to renegotiate a contract, and he's always  stood by his word."  </P> <P> Ryan left the game Wednesday night with the Yankees leading, 7-4. The Rangers  eventually came back to win, 9-7, in 11 innings. Madden, whose spirits soared  and tumbled with each turn of events Wednesday, plans to fly to Milwaukee to  witness Ryan's next attempt at victory No. 300. Ryan is expected to pitch  Monday or Tuesday.  </P> <P> Two years ago, when Ryan became a free agent after playing for the Houston  Astros for nine years, Madden organized a widely publicized petition campaign  to bring Ryan back to the Angels.  </P> <P> "We got 10,000 signatures," Madden said. "And the Angels were that close to  signing him."  </P> <P> On Wednesday, the bar was crowded with Ryan watchers. While they didn't have  much to cheer about, they signed a poster to be sent to their hero  congratulating Ryan -- prematurely, it turned out -- on his milestone victory,  and consumed specially named concoctions such as the Fireballer (cinnamon  schnapps and Tabasco sauce) and the 300 Club (don't even ask).  </P> <P> "Keep Chugging," read one inscription on the poster. Everyone in the bar  certainly did.  </P> <P> Some fans, such as Brendan Devlin of Orange, became Ryan-lovers when he pitched  for the Angels and have remained devoted.  </P> <P> "To be a Nolan Ryan fan, you don't have to keep up with the numbers or stats,"  Devlin said. "You just have to like the man."  </P> <P> Some devotees are transplanted Texans and come to Silky Sullivan's to cheer on  one of their own.  </P> <P> "When he's done, that'll be it," said Chris Smart, who grew up in Houston and  now lives in Huntington Beach. "Coaching, managing, who cares? He justs wants  to go back to Alvin, (Tex.) . . . He's honest."  </P> <P> Dave Erickson, a Fountain Valley native who watches at Silky Sullivan's most of  Ryan's appearances, said his interest in the 43-year-old pitcher is not like  some other fans'. "These guys are obsessive-compulsive about it," Erickson  said. "I've got more important things to do than chase him around the country."  </P> <P> Some "Silk's" regulars say that the biggest Ryanmaniac among them is Chuck  Baldree, a sales manager who lives in Huntington Beach. Baldree was not at the  bar Wednesday night; he was in Arlington, Tex., watching the game.  </P> <P> Baldree, a Houston native, has a shrine to Ryan in his Irvine office. It  includes stacks of baseball cards, photos, newspaper clippings, Ryan figurines,  books by and about him, and a "limited edition" bronze replica of Ryan's hand  -- holding a baseball.  </P> <P> Baldree recently purchased Ryan's new video, "Feel the Heat," said his wife,  Nancy,who stayed here Wednesday because she is pregnant and she did not want to  feel the heat of Texas.  </P> <P> "How many times have I seen that video?" she said. "How about every time  someone new comes in the house?"  </P></p>

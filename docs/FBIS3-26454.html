A  comprehensive appraisal by scientific and technological  personnel indicates that following this technical  transformation, the launch facilities can launch many types of  carrier rockets. China's comprehensive satellite launching  ability has improved.    In 1993, the Xichang satellite launch center carried out a  large-scale technical transformation, with the support of dozens  of scientific research and production units throughout the  country. Technological personnel completed the transformation of  more than 100 important projects -- including the launch pad  system, the booster acceleration system, and the testing system  for rockets and satellites -- thus improving the ability of  China's space flight industry to join international competition.</p>

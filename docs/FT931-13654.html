			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Growing taste for alliances in the food industry: The trend for joint ventures making worldwide products AT a concert last year Mr Floris Maljers, co-chairman of Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group, and Mr Antoine Riboud, chairman of BSN, France's largest food manufacturer, fell to chatting about their companies' operations. As they talked, both men began to see opportunities to do business together. That chance conversation bore fruit this week when the companies announced a joint venture to make and market worldwide products which combine ice cream, in which Unilever is world leader, with yoghurt, of which BSN is the biggest producer. Until recently, such collaboration would have been anathema in an industry where big manufacturers have long sought full control over their businesses. Most have resorted to collaboration only on a limited, ad hoc basis to help them enter difficult markets, such as developing countries. However, since the end of the 1980s, the industry's taste for strategic alliances and joint ventures has grown steadily on both sides of the Atlantic. As the table shows, every year has seen at least one big deal. All these alliances aim to develop sizeable international businesses offering rapid growth, often in embryonic markets. Nestle and Coca-Cola, for instance, are collaborating to distribute canned hot drinks through vending machines, a business largely unknown outside Japan. The trend owes much to the stagnation of traditional food markets in industrialised countries. 'To keep growing, companies need to develop higher-margin products which respond to new tastes and fashions,' says Mr John Campbell, food industry analyst with County NatWest. These pressures have intensified the search for short cuts to faster innovation, lower costs and to enable new products to be launched on several world markets at once. As Mr Helmut Maucher, chairman of Nestle, says: 'Nowadays, the quick devour the slow.' Mr Maljers says Unilever could have developed its own yoghurt technology, but that would have probably taken three years and much management time. Another option was to buy a successful medium-sized yoghurt maker, but none was available. Indeed, strategic alliances partly reflect diminishing acquisition opportunities, following a wave of international mergers which began in the mid-1980s. 'Quite a lot of good targets have already gone,' says Mr Maljers. Most alliances to date combine complementary skills and assets. Nestle's deal with Coca-Cola, for instance, marries the former's strengths in soluble coffee and tea with the latter's powerful international distribution and vending machine networks. In Cereal Partners Worldwide, the roles are reversed. General Mills of the US contributes its extensive know-how in breakfast cereals - which Nestle says it would have needed 20 years to match - while the Swiss company provides distribution and merchandising. General Mills' snacks venture with PepsiCo is slightly different, aiming to achieve scale economies by merging two rival established businesses. Nonetheless, General Mills' greater strength in northern Europe is matched by PepsiCo's in the south. Another key ingredient is a clear identity of interest between alliance partners. Mr Maucher stresses the importance of good 'chemistry' in their relations, while Mr Maljers says: 'The companies must have generally similar attitudes to the consumer, quality, retailing, distribution and service. There can be no compromise on any of these points.' However, the structure of individual partnerships varies. While operating responsibility in some is equally shared or entrusted to independent management, in others one partner is clearly predominant. Unilever and PepsiCo, for instance, are clearly in the driving seat in their respective ventures with BSN and General Mills. It is still too soon to judge how far hopes for strategic alliances will be justified by results. Cereal Partners, one of the earliest, aims for Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) in sales by the end of the decade and has built annual sales of Dollars 200m after only two years. But big profits will take longer. Industry leaders are also cautious about predicting how fast the trend will spread. Mr Maljers admits he has yet to think through many of the longer-term issues involved, while Mr Maucher warns against euphoria about what strategic alliances can achieve. He warns that getting the right fit between companies is not easy, and that alliances are vulnerable to changes in the ownership or corporate objectives of the partners involved. A further obstacle could be posed by anti-trust authorities in Washington and Brussels - though none of the deals so far has encountered regulatory objections. Against that, Mr Maljers argues that successful joint ventures stand a good chance of surviving over the long term - not least because dissolving them could create 'horrendous problems' over which partner would be entitled to ownership of the brands involved. Meanwhile, he is pondering the next steps, and is particularly intrigued by the possibility of forming alliances with Japanese companies. These could widen both Unilever's access to the Japanese market and its product range by extending it, for instance, to Japanese noodles. However, he is also acutely aware that similar initiatives by western companies in other industries have ended in disappointment: 'The big question is, is it conceivable that this kind of arrangement with the Japanese can be made to work?'  ---------------------------------------------------------------------      STRATEGIC ALLIANCES IN THE INTERNATIONAL FOOD INDUSTRY  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Year         Companies                   Purpose formed       involved  --------------------------------------------------------------------- 1989         Nestle (Switzerland)        Formation of Clintec 50/50              Baxter Healthcare (US)      joint venture in clinical                                          nutrition  --------------------------------------------------------------------- 1989         Nestle (Switzerland)        Formation of Cereal Partners              General Mills (US)          Worldwide, 50/50 joint                                          venture to make and sell                                          ready-to-eat breakfast                                          cereals outside US and Canada  --------------------------------------------------------------------- 1990         Nestle (Switzerland)        Formation of Coc-Cola-Nestle              Coca-Cola (US)              Refreshment Co, 50/50 joint                                          venture to develop                                          ready-to-drink tea and coffee                                          market outside Japan  --------------------------------------------------------------------- 1991         PepsiCo (US)                Joint venture to develop tea-              Unilever (UK-Netherlands)   based drinks and distribution                                          of Lipton tea products,                                          initially in US  --------------------------------------------------------------------- 1992         PepsiCo (US)                Merger of continental              General Mills (US)          European snackfood businesses                                          in 60/40 joint venture  --------------------------------------------------------------------- 1993         Unilever (UK-Netherlands)   Joint venture to make and              BSN (France)                market worldwide products                                          combining ice cream and                                          yoghurt  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

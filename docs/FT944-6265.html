			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Tax): Unequal Scottish business rate ends - Rates The long-running disadvantage in non-domestic rates suffered by Scottish businesses compared with their English counterparts is to be eliminated from April 1 1995, with Scotland achieving a uniform business rate poundage set at the same level as England. Scottish business organisations welcomed the harmonisation of non-domestic rate poundages north and south of the border, which is being achieved thanks to movements expected in rateable values. The transition will be eased by a Pounds 72m injection by the Treasury. It will mean the achievement of an objective the Conservative government has been working towards since 1989. Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, said the average Scottish poundage would drop by 5.3p (11 per cent) to a uniform 43.2p, the same level as that for England. In Glasgow the poundage will drop by 9.7p and in Edinburgh by 6.6p. Rateable values are to be revalued for the 1995-96 financial year and the Scottish Office believes this will result in an average increase of just less than 20 per cent in rateable values in Scotland. Little overall change in rateable values is expected in England. The new rateable values will be assessed on the same basis as in England. Mr Lang said transitional arrangements would ensure that no business suffered annual increases of more than 10 per cent, allowing for inflation. For property with a new rateable value of less than Pounds 10,000 the maximum real increase will be 7.5 per cent. The transitional arrangements will be partly funded by the Pounds 72m exchequer contribution and by limiting the reductions in bills to 10 per cent for small businesses and 5 per cent for those with a rateable value of more than Pounds 10,000.</p>

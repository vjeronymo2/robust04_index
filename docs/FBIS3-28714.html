In doing so, ASEAN do not realize the immense potential  in cross-border investment. For far too long, member countries  have been relying on investments outside ASEAN. This will only  serve to make the region dependent on others. Besides this, it  is not in line with efforts toward ASEAN economic integration.    The fact is that member countries do not have to go far for  investment. With regional trade expanding rapidly, there is  much scope for greater intra-ASEAN investment as well. As Prime  Minister Datuk Sri Dr Mahathir Mohamed noted, investment by  ASEAN investors in ASEAN had grown substantially over the years.  However, the choice by ASEAN investors to place their money in  the region does not come automatically. It is vital for member  countries to provide a conducive climate for investment. This  means that the investment climate must be ideal, with the  necessary laws and policies in place.    ASEAN countries have done well in providing the right  environment for foreign investment. Still, with other regions  also competing for investment, member countries must guard  against complacency. Economies in Eastern Europe, Latin America,  and Africa are competing for foreign capital to create jobs and  prosperity. Here, a key to cross-border investment is to  complement one another's economic mood. This is exactly why the  growth triangle concept has become very popular in the region.  It is more effective for a few countries to get together to  develop their respective regions bordering each other. Within a  short period of time, the committees in charge of developing the  growth triangle have swung into action. It is a matter of time  before they start bearing fruit.    The bottom line is that if their investment climate is ideal  for ASEAN countries, they should also be conducive for investors  from outside the region. Therefore, there is much scope for not  only intra-ASEAN trade, but cross-border investments as well  among member countries. The challenge is for the respective  private sectors to tap into each other's potential. Rather than  going for high-cost areas far away, ASEAN countries are among  the most lucrative investment destinations. Areas that need to  be looked into to ensure the flow of investments of proper  infrastructure facilities. [sentence as heard] Efforts should  be made to enhance skilled manpower in the region. This could  encourage reverse investment by some of the more developed  countries in neighboring ASEAN countries.    All this would go a long way in boosting the region's quest  for a single free market. When that is achieved, ASEAN would  emerge as a cohesive force, much to the envy of others. At the  same time, it would give the region a better bargaining power in  international economic issues.</p>

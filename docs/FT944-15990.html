			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / International Company News: Kidder sale talks intensify PaineWebber, the US securities house, was locked in talks yesterday on the acquisition of most of the business of Kidder Peabody, the troubled investment banking arm of General Electric. The talks have intensified since last week, when the two were discussing only the sale of Kidder's retail broking business. If completed, a deal could lead to GE exchanging its equity interest in Kidder for a stake of around 25 per cent in PaineWebber, worth Dollars 275m at yesterday's market price. GE executives sent in to run Kidder earlier this year have maintained they did not set out to sell the bank, though they have not rejected approaches made to them. Two years ago, GE came close to selling the bank to Primerica, the financial services group since renamed Travelers. Kidder has been widely viewed as unsaleable on Wall Street in recent months. It was rocked by the disclosure of what it alleges was a scheme to create Dollars 350m of fictitious profits, while the downturn in bond prices this year revealed the bank's over-reliance for its earnings on one corner of the financial markets, the market for mortgage-backed bonds. However, nine days ago, Kidder's bosses announced a plan to shrink the bank and shift its most illiquid and difficult-to-value securities to another GE subsidiary, a move widely seen as a prelude to a sale. According to a source close to the talks, a purchase would strengthen PaineWebber's business on a number of fronts. It would bring it Kidder's 1,250-strong retail broking salesforce; the fund management business and investment banking operations are also said to interest PaineWebber. While Kidder leads Wall Street in the business of underwriting mortgage-backed bonds, neither bank has a strong presence as an underwriter of equity or corporate debt. By combining broking salesforces and underwriting operations, the two could become a more powerful force.</p>

			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Leading Article: Russian reform under attack MR YEGOR Gaidar, the 'courageous, determined and just plain clever' (as Mr Boris Yeltsin, his president called him) acting prime minister of Russia, yesterday failed to receive the necessary support of the Congress of People's Deputies to be confirmed as prime minister. He may remain as acting prime minister under presidential protection, but his equivocal status is the last thing a man in his tight corner needs. The Congress of People's Deputies has not materially affected the reality which the majority of the deputies profess to hate. In part, the populist rage expressed was proper, even healthy: as people's tribunes, they should be reflecting the hardship being suffered by many of their constituents - and there are clear signs that considerations of this kind, absent under the old system, are now registering strongly. In part, however, it was damaging, taking the form of grasping for a control it could never exercise and for the right to decide issues it could never judge. Mr Gaidar and his team come out of that forum with the world as it was when they went in. Monthly inflation is still reckoned to be running at around 25 per cent; the fall in production over the year is around 20 per cent, as is the fall in exports. The central bank answers to a populist parliament. Even if it did not, it is not clear that any central bank would be able to deny credit to enterprises which would otherwise lay off masses of workers. If the world is no better, Mr Gaidar is in far worse shape. He has agreed, or is party to Mr Yeltsin's agreement, to indexation of the value of individual savings, to a very slow rise in the price of oil, to a rise in real living standards, to an end to production falls and to support and protection for industry. But he is also committed to bringing down inflation. Constitutional crisis The circle cannot be squared. The Russian government cannot stop the halt in production and increase employment, while lowering the rate of inflation, reducing the budget deficit and stabilising the currency at the same time. Two conclusions can be drawn from this Congress. First, Russia is in a constitutional crisis. The current mess puts a high premium on political manoeuvring, cripples effective government and could rapidly lead to a polarisation of attitudes and even a declaration of presidential rule, after which democratic institutions would be hard to reconstruct. Constitutional change has become mandatory Second, the Civic Union alliance, with which the government tried to make a deal, is a loose coalition, at least part of which is interested in reform. It seems to possess a reformist wing that is beginning to understand the constraints under which the government works and is willing to offer qualified aid. What this might amount to in practice is unclear. Foreign support In order to get the necessary political space for a constitutional settlement, introduction of the market economy and macroeconomic stabilisation, the government needs the support from abroad that has been lacking so far. The targets set by the International Monetary Fund as a condition for a standby agreement are meaningless in today's conditions. Furthermore, any IMF-guided stabilisation programme has little chance of working in the short term. The west must face up to the urgency and proximity of the Russian collapse. In the absence of other leadership, this will be an early dilemma for Mr Bill Clinton. Mr Clinton was right to argue, as he did during the electoral campaign, that the cold war was 'won' above all by the way people of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union rejected the communist system. He needs to build on that truth with a plan to organise assistance of a scale and kind that is relevant to Russia's problems and recognises its importance. The present Congress has refused to confirm Russia's bold reformer. In so doing, it has aggravated the crisis without proposing any solution. Mr Gaidar seemed, last night, likely to limp on until spring in a temporary capacity. If the west is serious about the support it has always trumpeted for him, it must come forward now with some determination and courage - and plain cleverness - of its own.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy by Ryszard Rybus; </F> place and date not given: "Jozef Oleksy for RZECZPOSPOLITA; I Do  Not Think the Prime Minister Does That"]    [Text] [Rybus] Do you agree with the suggestion made by  Marek Borowski, deputy chairman of the Club of the Democratic  Left Alliance [SLD] concerning the possibilities of limiting the  presidential powers by the parliament?    [Oleksy] This is a statement by one of the SLD activists,  which is neither the stand of the club nor the stand taken by  the party. This is a complex statement in the background of  recent events. Now these events are very bad. The fact that  the president refused to sign the candidacy of Professor Rosati,  even though the coalition was fully convinced about the values  of this candidacy, must be politically significant.    [Rybus] In the commentary of the Saturday [26 March] issue  of TRYBUNA appeared such expressions as "political vengeance"  and "panic" of a president that is losing power. Are these  acute expressions the foretaste of a confrontation with the  Belweder?    [Oleksy] I do not know. You are asking me about a  confrontation of the left with the president. However, it was  the president who made this decision.    [Rybus] Commentators who evaluate the issue of Rosati's  nomination point at the possibility of Prime Minister Pawlak's  participation in this game.    [Oleksy] I do not suspect the prime minister of making any  secret moves like that, because, as I understand, this is what  you mean. The prime minister did delay forwarding the motion,  which surprised the SLD; however, a serious decision was being  made, and it is difficult to quarrel over days and hours. The  fact is that the prime minister submitted the motion, which the  president refused to sign. He took advantage of his  constitutional powers. Now the analysis of the case can only be  political. One has to ask the following question: What purpose  does such a decision by the president serve? I am afraid that  it does not serve the purpose of putting our economic life in  order. Nor does it serve the signals that go from us abroad,  where Prof. Rosati is a well-known individual.    [Rybus] The points in the Rosati game will probably not be  scored by the SLD. Now the question remains who will gain more:  the Belweder or Prime Minister Pawlak?    [Oleksy] These are speculations that the Sejm speaker should  not really make....    [Rybus] How about the deputy chairman of the Social  Democracy of the Polish Republic?    [Oleksy] The issue is not about who has gained and who has  lost. If such a count were to be kept, this would have to mean  another phase in the lack of agreement between the activities of  the state's highest organs in issues important to the state.  And I deplore this.    [Rybus] Can the events of the recent days begin the process  of disintegration of the coalition?    [Oleksy] I do not think so, and I would oppose it.    [Rybus] How will this dispute end, now that the president  has declared, through his spokesman, that a change in this  decision is out of the question?    [Oleksy] The end is unclear. I am not able to imagine it at  the moment because I am afraid that there may appear elements of  emotion and prestige that will obscure the heart of the matter.  I would not like this to happen. I believe that appropriate  coalition bodies, as well as organs of the individual coalition  members, will convene and make a political evaluation of the  situation.</p>

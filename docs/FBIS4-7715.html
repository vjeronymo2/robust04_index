			<p>BFN     [Text] The Bosnia-Herzegovina Government has written to the  Government of the Republic of Croatia from today's session  [words indistinct].    We were surprised to hear the instructions of the Croatian  Government's Office for Refugees, which discontinues refugee  status in the Republic of Croatia for citizens from the area of  the Mostar municipality. Our surprise is all the greater since  we know that Arif Smajkic, minister for refugees, labor, and  social policy in the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government, during his  recent visit and talks with deputy prime minister of the  Croatian Government Ivica Kostovic, and director of the Office  for Refugees Adalbert Rebic agreed on joint activities of the  two governments regarding the return of refugees from Croatia to  Bosnia-Herzegovina. An identical agreement was reached with the  representatives of the Croatian people in Bosnia-Herzegovina at  the recently held Constituent Assembly of the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Federation. Therefore, we propose to the Croatian Government to  annul the aforementioned instructions and create conditions for  joint preparations for all activities pertaining to the  organized return of refugees and displaced persons to which we  are obliged by the provisions of international treaties on the  repatriation of refugees, reads the statement of the Information  Ministry.</p>

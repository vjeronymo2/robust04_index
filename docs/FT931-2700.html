			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Clinton 'serious' on Ulster mission PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday said he was still giving 'serious consideration' to sending either a special US envoy or a fact-finding mission to help end the sectarian violence in Northern Ireland. But he declared that 'the most significant thing I should be doing now is to encourage the resumption of the dialogue between the Irish and the British governments'. The president spoke after a St Patrick's Day meeting in the White House with Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister. Mr Reynolds applauded Mr Clinton's determination to contribute to a solution in Ulster, adding that the US 'has the potential to be uniquely helpful'. But Mr Reynolds ducked questions about whether he would support either of the two initiatives under consideration. The UK government is opposed to the despatch of an envoy but had indicated a willingness to accept a fact-finding mission, depending on its terms of reference. Mr Clinton stressed that 'I don't think the US can make peace in Northern Ireland and I don't think that the unionists and the nationalists and anybody else would expect that'. He added, without elaboration, that he still supported the MacBride principles intended to ensure that discrimination is not practised in any foreign investments in the province. Mr Clinton also announced the nomination of Mrs Jean Kennedy Smith, sister to the three Kennedy brothers, as the next US ambassador to Dublin. Such modest US political pressure as there was on Mr Clinton to intervene in Ulster has, if anything, abated since the visit of Mr John Major, the British prime minister, last month. Yesterday a ritual St Patrick's Day motion condemning violations of human rights in Ulster and urging Mr Clinton to send an envoy was introduced into the House for the record by Congressman Hamilton Fish, New York Republican, but it was not debated.</p>

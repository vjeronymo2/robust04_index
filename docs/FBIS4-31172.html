			<p>BFN     [Text] Geneva, 6 Jun (TANJUG) -- Srpska republic president  Radovan Karadzic has said that he is ready to sign a document on  a permanent cessation of hostilities throughout the territory of  the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Karadzic  stressed that the Serb side is in favor of a permanent, not  limited, cessation of all forms of hostilities.    Early this morning, at a meeting between Yasushi Akashi, the  UN special envoy for the former Yugoslavia, and Muslim Vice  President Ejup Ganic [title as received], the Muslim-Croat side  insisted that it would accept only two months of a cessation of  hostilities at the most. The Muslims and Croats believe that in  that period an agreement on the basis of the contact group's  proposal for the territorial division of the former Yugoslav  Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina should be reached.    Ganic told Akashi that "the Muslim-Croat side does not,  under  any circumstances, want the Geneva conference to freeze the  current situation in former Bosnia-Herzegovina."</p>

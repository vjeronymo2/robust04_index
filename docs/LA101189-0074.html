			<p><P> October 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WOOLRIDGE TO MISS EXHIBITION OPENER  </P> <P> After five days of practicing long hours in stuffy Otto Klum Gymnasium, the  Lakers will open an eight-game exhibition schedule tonight at 10:30, PDT,  against the Sacramento Kings at Blaisdell Center.  </P> <P> Coach Pat Riley said forward Orlando Woolridge, whose sore right knee was  drained again Monday night, will not play tonight but probably will play in  Thursday night's game against the Kings here.  </P> <P> "If (Woolridge's knee) swells up again Friday after Pat plays him on Thursday,  then we will send him to see Dr. (Robert) Kerlan and probably (perform  arthroscopic surgery) to find out if there is an underlying cause to the  swelling," Laker trainer Gary Vitti said.  </P> <P> The Lakers will return to Los Angeles early Friday morning before flying the  same day to Knoxville, Tenn., to play the New Jersey Nets Saturday.  </P> <P> Riley said he plans to keep all 15 players throughout the exhibition season  before determining his 12-player roster. At least during the first two  exhibition games, Riley said he will remove his veteran players "at the first  sign of fatigue."  </P> <P> Steve Bucknall, a rookie free-agent guard from North Carolina, injured a finger  on his left hand in practice Monday, but Bucknall had his hand taped and  practiced Tuesday.

			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading TRADING IN stock index futures was characterised by volatility, with many traders choosing to focus on the short-term outlook, writes Joel Kibazo. The March Footsie contract opened strongly on the back of a squeeze and soon raced to a premium of 40 to the underlying cash market. However, a surprise announcement by the Bank of Spain of an increase in its short-end interest rates curtailed the March contract's early advance and it retreated to a premium of 22, its estimated fair value to cash. However, buying soon returned and March recovered the ground lost after the announcement, boosted by the strong opening on Wall Street and a squeeze towards the market close. March ended at 2,561, some 23 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash. Turnover reached 6,370 lots. In traded options, turnover recovered from Monday's poor level to reach 29,608 contracts. The FT-SE 100 index was busy and had 7,643 contracts traded. Boots was the busiest stock option. It traded 2,940 lots, with a Kleinwort Benson roll-over trade of 1,000 contracts reported to have been responsible for the majority of the day's business.</p>

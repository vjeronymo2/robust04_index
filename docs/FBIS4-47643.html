			<p>BSF      Command Fuels Russia-Ukraine Tensions in Krym                           SUMMARY     Russia's Black Sea Fleet (BSF) command appears to be making  common cause with the new Pro-Russian Crimean leadership,  criticizing Ukraine on BSF issues and supporting Crimean  officials' calls for a role in Ukrainian-Russian negotiations  over the division of the former Soviet fleet.  Most recently, the  BSF command has appeared to deliberately fuel Russian-Ukrainian  tensions and aggravate the already difficult relationship between  Krym and Ukraine by spreading incendiary and unsubstantiated  rumors about Ukrainian military actions in Krym.                         END SUMMARY     Russian Black Sea Fleet officials have made repeated attacks on  Ukrainian stands in the BSF talks and demanded that the Crimean  Government be brought into Russian-Ukrainian negotiations over  the fleet:     -- Following the 21-22 April round of talks on the status of the  fleet, the BSF Press Center issued a statement criticizing the  Ukrainian side as being "unprepared for compromise" and for  insisting that the Russian BSF and Ukrainian Navy both be  stationed in Sevastopol.  The statement said that the Ukrainian  position contradicted "not only the logic of military  organizational development . . . and the will of the presidents"  but also the latest decisions of the Sevastopol City Soviet that  the Ukrainian fleet should be moved (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 28  April).     -- In a joint statement on 26 April, BSF Commander Admiral Eduard  BaIt in, Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov, and Chairman of the  Sevastopol City Soviet Viktor Semyonov appeared to blame Ukraine  for the breakdown of the latest round of talks on 21 April,  charging that "struggles for political power and the Ukrainian  presidency" could turn the negotiations into a "military  conflict."  The statement decried "attempts" to "lay blame for a  possible break-up of Ukraine's statehood" on Krym and urged the  Russian and Ukrainian presidents to resume talks and "act as  guarantors of peace" in Krym (ITAR-TASS, 26 April).     -- In an interview with Interfax on 26 April, Chief of the BSF  Headquarters Rear Admiral Petr Svyatashov criticized Ukraine's  insistence that Meshkov be excluded from negotiations between  Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev and Ukrainian Defense  Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy.  Svyatashov accused Radetskyy of  placing himself above the law, asserting that Ukrainian  legislation--which states that the Crimean leadership must be  informed of the establishment of new military units and the  disposition of troops--justifies Crimean involvement in the  talks.     BSF Stokes Crimean-Ukrainian Disputes     In addition to taking anti-Ukrainian stands on issues related to  the BSF itself, the BSF command appears to have exacerbated the  potential for Crimean-Ukrainian conflict by issuing  unsubstantiated reports of Ukrainian troop movements.  After  Crimean Acting Internal Affairs Minister Valeriy Kuznetsov  claimed to the Crimean legislature on 18 May that Ukrainian  Deputy Internal Affairs Minister Valentin Nedryhaylo and spetsnaz  troops had attempted a "coup" against the Crimean leadership  (UNIAN, 19 May), sources from the BSF Headquarters were cited in  ITAR-TASS as reporting that "Ukrainian home guards and special  forces numbering 1,000" and a "group of saboteur swimmers" had  been dispatched to Krym (19 May), and that a Ukrainian military  field hospital was being set up in Kherson Oblast preparing to  receive wounded people from Ktym "in the near future" (Kiev World  Service, 19 May).  Neither of these reports has been confirmed by  other media.     In at least one case, Russian media have censured the BSF command  for its inflammatory statements.  A 4 May Izvestiya article  entitled "Black Sea Fleet Press Center Continues to Spread  Disinformation" asserted that citizens of the CIS "suffer acutely  from [a]  misunderstanding" of Russian-Ukrainian relations as a  result of news agencies "succumbing" to "manipulation" by the BSF  Press Center.  The article highlighted early May media coverage  of an allegedly "wicked" attack on the official car carrying the  wife of BSF Commander Baltin, and countered that, according to  the Sevastopol internal affairs chief, Major General V.  Beloborodov, the BSF official car tried a "double-pass," nearly  causing a collision, prompting the other driver involved--an  excitable person"--to express his feelings toward the driver and  Baltin's wife "in uncensored form."  The Sevastopol Internal  Affairs Administration stated officially that there had been  no  "attack" on Admiral Baltin's wife.     Crimean Position on BSF     These stands by the BSF leadership have supported demands put  forward by Meshkov and other officials in Simferopol and  Sevastopol to play a prominent role in the talks:     -- Meshkov reportedly stated that it would be "most logical" if  the BSF question were resolved by Krym and Russia alone (ITAR-  TASS, 5 May).  In a press conference after his 30 January  election victory, Meshkov was quoted as saying that the fleet  must "be a single unit, belong to Russia, and be based at  Sevastopol" (Interfax, 2 February).     -- On the Russian Defense Ministry's "Slavyanka" program, Crimean  Deputy Premier Yevgeniy Saburov sharply criticized Ukraine for  attempting to reap the economic benefits--which he claimed  rightfully belonged to Krym--of a BSF settlement with Russia.  Saburov asserted that Ukraine's refusal to allow full Crimean  representation in the talks suggested a "mercenary interest in  making use of the benefits of the Russian proposal" and demanded  that any decisions must "benefit Sevastopol, the fleet, and the  families of the sailors who live there."  He also stated flatly  that a joint fleet is "out of the question . . . it must be a  Russian fleet" (Moscow Radio, 12 May).     -- Chairman of the Sevastopol Administration Mykola Hlushkov, in  an appeal to Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Leonid Kravchuk,  reportedly deemed it "necessary" that Sevastopol city leaders  take part in BSF negotiations to ensure that Russia and Ukraine  address the question of economic assistance to the region (UNIAR,  28 April).     -- After discussing the BSF issue, the Sevastopol City Soviet  reportedly recommended to Kiev that the Ukrainian Navy  headquarters and other installations be relocated out of  Sevastopol (Segodnya, 21 April).     Ukraine Rebuffs BSF, Minimizes Crimean Role     While Ukrainian official statements have in the past criticized  actions and statements by the BSF command (Kiev Radio Ukraine  World Service, 16 March; Kiev Ukraine Radio, 14 April), Kiev  recently appears to have stepped up its rhetoric against the BSF  command's actions.  Following the coup rumors, a 19 May Ukrainian  Defense Ministry statement vehemently decried the  "misinformation" circulated by the BSF as "malicious falsehoods     carrying out open subversive activities" on Ukraine's  sovereign territory (Kiev World Service, 19 May).     Ukrainian officials have consistently tried to exclude Krym from  the BSF negotiations.  Although Kravchuk in a 26 April  Rossiyskiye Vesti interview acknowledged that Krym has a "role"  in the talks, he emphasized the need to "ensure that Krym does  not drive [Ukraine and Russia] or their peoples apart."  Nezavisimaya Gazeta on 22 April  reported that, before the 21  April BSF negotiations began at the BSF Headquarters in  Sevastopol, Radetskyy declared that the talks could riot proceed  "with the participation or even in the presence of" Meshkov or  Sevastopol's Semenov, both of whom subsequently left the room.  A  "high-ranking" Ukrainian diplomat was quoted as saying that  resolution of the BSF issue requires that Ukraine "reject the  politicking of the Crimeans and talk with the real owners of the  fleet" (Izvestiya, 15 April).     Outlook     The apparent BSF support for the Crimean leadership and its  spreading of the inflammatory rumors are likely to fuel Ukrainian  suspicions of Russian meddling in Krym and intransigence over  division of the BSF.  If not checked, these BSF actions risk  providing Kiev with its own pretext for intransigence in the  negotiations or, at worst, provoking Ukraine to additional  actions to assert what it views as its legitimate authority in  Krym.

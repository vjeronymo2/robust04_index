			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Andrew Marshall report: "Brussels Offers Ukraine Energy if </F> it Scraps Reactors"]    [Text] The European Union [EU] will help Ukraine to  overcome its energy crisis if it scraps the Chernobyl nuclear  reactor, officials in Luxembourg said yesterday. The proposal  is contained in a new strategy for assisting the unstable former  Soviet republic, that is likely to be agreed by the Commission  next week. As fears grow about the political instability of the  Union's eastern neighbours, these states are now being given  increasing attention.    Ukraine has slid up the list of European priorities in the  last six months as the EU and Washington try to untie policy  towards Kiev from Russia. Ukraine agreed in January to scrap  its nuclear weapons in a tripartite deal with Moscow and  Washington, and since then Kiev has lobbied for greater  assistance, especially with energy. An EU Partnership and  Co-operation agreement was initialled last month, expanding  trade ties. Now the Twelve are trying to give more to Ukraine.  Help with building new power stations would assist the country  overcome its energy crisis.    But this help would be conditional on it scrapping dangerous  Soviet-style reactors such as Chernobyl. The EU is also likely  to propose help with agriculture and foreign investment to prop  up Ukraine's moribund economy.    Sir Leon Brittan, EU Trade Commissioner, told foreign  ministers meeting in Luxembourg of his plans. The Commission  document is likely to recommend macro-economic aid if Ukraine  gets an agreement with the International Monetary Fund. It will  discuss increased trade access and closer political links.  Britain has also prepared a list of proposals; these are likely  to be welded with the Commission's approach.    Last night, the EU was said to be closer to a deal with  Russia that has been blocked by a row over nuclear trade.  Europe maintains limits on imports of nuclear fuel from Russia,  largely at the insistence of France. It is hoped this can be  removed as an obstacle to signing a Partnership and Co-operation  Agreement. The EU is trying to cement ties with Central and  Eastern European countries, two of which -- Poland and Hungary  -- have applied to join.</p>

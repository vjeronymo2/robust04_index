			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Opportunity to redesign Design Council must not be wasted Sir, The decision to restructure the Design Council is broadly right ('Design Council break-up decided by government', September 24). The Chartered Society of Designers particularly welcomes the appointment as the council's new chairman of John Sorrell, a designer and businessman with an impressive record of promoting design. This society, representing UK design professionals, has repeatedly called both for the council's role to be redefined and for a new programme to convince industrialists of the value of investing in design. Designers will welcome the government's apparent commitment to what Christopher Lorenz ('The Design Council on a crash diet', September 24) describes as a 'high-powered research, evangelism and lobbying body'. But certain questions still have to be answered if the newly reorganised Design Council is to achieve its core objectives. The introduction of design advice into a total of 200 Business Links will require substantial investment. The new plans proposed by trade and industry minister, Tim Sainsbury, with their clear potential to help a greater number of businesses to integrate design into the mainstream of their activity, may require an increase in government funding. Mr Lorenz is right to highlight concerns over the transfer of essential services from the existing council to new homes. Funding is a part of the solution to this, but so is an ongoing process of close consultation. A close two-way relationship between the design profession and agencies, including Business Links, will be essential. In particular, the work presently undertaken by the Design Council in the field of education must not suffer during the transition. Similarly the new structure must ensure a continuity of the much valued regional expertise built by the council. Until the designers this country trains are employed to design our exports, rather than the goods we import from abroad, British competitiveness will continue to suffer. The restructuring of the Design Council is an opportunity that must not he wasted. Jeremy Rewse-Davies, president, Chartered Society of Designers, 29 Bedford Square, London WC1B 3EG</p>

			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Silk flowers and chips - Victor Mallet examines a father-son business in Thailand Like his father, Richard Han is an entrepreneur to the core. When he was studying for his MBA at City University in London, the man who is now chief executive of Thailand's Hana Microelectronics group had a sideline importing Thai silk flowers and selling them to shops such as Harrods. He went on to exploit a loophole in British customs regulations, importing watch straps and cheap digital watch movements from his father's factory in Thailand (tariffs were lower than for completed watches), assembling them at home and selling them in Petticoat Lane, London; the business grew and he once sold 1m watches to Texaco for a UK petrol station promotion. But when he returned to Thailand four years ago, Han, now 36, took on the more daunting task of turning round the troubled family business. In common with other second or third-generation ethnic Chinese businessmen, he was able to supplement the family's entrepreneurial skills with a more modern management style, essential for the fast-growing, high- technology businesses at the forefront of south-east Asia's economic boom. His Fukkienese grandfather and his father Swie Yam Han had fled the anti-communist, anti-Chinese massacres in Indonesia in the 1960s and established car distribution and assembly businesses in Thailand. His father, says Han, quickly 'figured that micro-electronics was the thing to be in and he was absolutely right'. Hana developed a profitable business making light-emitting diode and liquid crystal display watch modules, before moving on to the manufacture of circuitry for analogue quartz watches. Then the company branched out into integrated circuits, creating Hana Semiconductor in 1984. By the time Han returned to Thailand, Hana was suffering from two problems: the integrated circuit and semiconductor packaging business was undercapitalised and the traditional management structure was such that nobody dared to tell his father - the revered, paternalistic and all-powerful boss - what was going wrong. Losses on the semiconductor business almost matched the watch profits and the watch market was becoming increasingly competitive. 'No manager ever told my father he was wrong,' says Han. 'In Thailand, because of this respect for one's elders, initiative in middle management is lacking. My father would never be questioned so he could never get feedback or decision-making from middle management. The company had grown and it was still very much a top-down management structure.' His father's mistake, says Han, lay partly in creating a financial framework for the capital-intensive semiconductor business that was almost identical to the successful formula adopted for its more labour-intensive forerunners. 'The capital was enough to buy half of one of those wirebonding machines,' he says. 'Now we've got 50 of them.' With his father still urging him to sell the semiconductor business, Han, applying what he had learned at business school in between selling flowers and watches, set about raising money and building a new factory to introduce the economies of scale he believed were necessary. Whereas his father had balked at mass production and thought Hana could operate as a 'niche player', Han realised that customers wanted to be sure that Hana could produce large runs of good quality at a reasonable price. 'We are in a service industry. I'm not selling a product, I'm selling a service,' he says. Promising to go public, Han sold 10 per cent of the company to outside investors, who diluted the absolute power of the family and were able to offer advice on financial strategy in the boardroom. Today, Hana is listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand and its shares - in contrast with those of other Thai electronics groups which have suffered falling profits - are sought after by foreign investors. Net profits have risen eightfold since 1988, and third-quarter profit this year was Baht84.7m (Pounds 2.24m), nearly double the figure in the same period last year. Han says the company, which now employs 3,700 people, counts Kodak among its customers (it makes small circuit boards for Kodak cameras), is building a new factory in northern Thailand, will spend Dollars 15m (Pounds 10m) on new equipment next year and is looking for suitable acquisitions. Han credits his father for spending time in Hong Kong and letting him tackle the restructuring. 'It very much depends on the parent-son relationship,' he says. 'It depends if the father is willing to release the reins. There are companies where the father still retains a stranglehold over the whole operation.'</p>

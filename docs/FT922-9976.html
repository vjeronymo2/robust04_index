			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Oil shares Last week's revival in oil shares - even unfashionable BP gained 10 per cent  -raises the question of whether the sector has been too long out of favour. There are two main arguments, both based on the view that oil companies' problems have been largely caused by recession. The first is that resumed growth in some western economies augurs well for the price of crude. The second is that the sector is closer to the turning point in the cycle for its downstream operations, notably petrochemicals. Both arguments have holes. While the fundamentals for oil prices have improved slightly in recent weeks, demand is scarcely roaring ahead. There is also huge uncertainty on the supply side, not least from Opec and the CIS. As for the downstream cycle, demand for petrochemicals is growing in the US but remains depressingly weak elsewhere. In any case, the cyclical rebound in profits may be held back by a degree of overcapacity. In marking oil shares higher, the market may simply have calculated that they must be cheap because they had fallen so far. But in recent months the sector has fragmented, with Shell and Enterprise rated as quality companies and the likes of BP and Lasmo reflecting the fact that their dividends are vulnerable. The market has been rational about the companies. It is perhaps in danger of being less realistic about the sector.</p>

			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / International Company News: Australian TV stake for TCI Tele-Communications, the largest US cable company, is making a small direct investment in Australis Media, the stock market-listed Australian company which holds one of the country's two publicly-available satellite broadcasting licences and has pledged to introduce pay-TV services to Australia later this year, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney. The US cable giant is also gaining boardroom representation at the fledgling Australian company. TCI is to acquire 6m convertible debentures at an issue price of ADollars 1.40 each, via its wholly-owned TCI-Australia subsidiary. TCI already holds an indirect interest in Australis, via its interest in Liberty Media, which is currently being merged into TCI. Liberty Media, in turn, owns 49.5 per cent of Lenfest Communications, which owns 49.9 per cent of Australis. The net effect of the latest investment, plus the complex indirect holding, is to give TCI a 26.5 per cent economic interest in Australis.</p>

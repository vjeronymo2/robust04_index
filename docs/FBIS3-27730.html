"I felt a great responsibility for having advocated a  political reform government," Tanaka told reporters at the  headquarters of Sakigake (Harbinger), a small component of  Hosokawa's seven-party coalition government and a party to which  he belongs. "I could not have quit if the political reform  bills had not gone through," he said. "But I can step down with  a stirring feeling because they were enacted."    Tanaka, 53, the No. 2 man of Sakigake, said his resignation  is in line with an accord with Hosokawa that he would step down  once Diet debate on political reform ends.    The government's political reform package cleared the Diet  on  Saturday after Hosokawa and Yohei Kono, president of the  opposition Liberal Democratic Party, reached a compromise on its  amendments in the next regular Diet session.    Hosokawa had staked his political fate on enactment by the  Saturday close of the extraordinary Diet session. The measures  are designed to clean up Japan's money driven political system  and clamp curbs on political donations.    Saying it is now time to fulfill his duty as a Sakigake  member to meet public expectations for the party, Tanaka  expressed hope he can continue supporting Hosokawa from outside  the government.    No one will take up the post of special adviser to the  premier after Tanaka quits, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi  Takemura told a Monday morning news conference.    The Hosokawa administration's next main task should be  administrative reform, Tanaka said, noting it is politicians,  not bureaucrats, who should be responsible for the way policies  are carried out. "I got the impression that the Diet has not  played its role sufficiently in closely monitoring  administrative authorities," he noted.    Tanaka has been elected to the House of Representatives  three  times from the No. 1 constituency of Nagano Prefecture.</p>

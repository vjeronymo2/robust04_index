			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Armenia and Azerbaijan agree to ceasefire ARMENIA and Azerbaijan yesterday agreed to a ceasefire from September 1 in the latest attempt to end four years of fighting in the Caucasus, Reuter reports from Moscow, quoting Russian news agencies. Itar-Tass and Nega reported that the two former Soviet republics had reached agreement in talks in Alma-Ata, the capital of Kazakhstan. According to Nega, the two warring sides signed a document stating their readiness to halt military operations from next Tuesday. The timing had been agreed between the Armenian and Azeri leaders and Kazakhstan's President Nursultan Nazarbayev, who had invited them to negotiate in Alma-Ata after earlier peace initiatives collapsed. Tass said the foreign ministers of Christian Armenia and Moslem Azerbaijan had agreed that further conflict was pointless and would only lead to 'irreparable losses' on both sides. A three-sided working group with Kazakh experts would be set up to work out ways to implement and monitor the ceasefire. More than 2,000 people have been killed in four years of fighting between the Caucasian neighbours - the deadliest conflict of the post-Soviet era. The unexpected accord, a diplomatic victory for Mr Nazarbayev, coincided with reports of fresh fighting in the region. Tass said six people had been killed and 20 wounded when an Azeri aircraft dropped anti-personnel and cluster bombs on Stepanakert, capital of the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh. Scores of people have been killed in Azeri air raids in the past week. The Armenians say the aircraft are former Soviet planes which Moscow recently handed to Azerbaijan. It was unclear how the two sides planned to make the ceasefire stick, given the breakdown of numerous earlier truces, including several mediated by Russia and Iran.</p>

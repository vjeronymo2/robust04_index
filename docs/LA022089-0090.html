			<p><P> February 20, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Look for lots of coverage of Asia this week, with the networks focusing on  President Bush's attendance at the funeral of Japanese Emperor Hirohito  followed by Bush's visit to Beijing and Seoul. The three networks, as well as  Cable News Network, will each have more than a half-dozen correspondents  reporting from the area. To be included in the Asian trek are CBS' Dan Rather,  NBC's Tom Brokaw and ABC's Peter Jennings. Live coverage of the Thursday  funeral will be provided by CNN and CBS (during the 8 p.m. telecast of "48  Hours").  </P></p>

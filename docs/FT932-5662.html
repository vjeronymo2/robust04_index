			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Chinese arrest three in Lhasa Chinese police arrested at least three men in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa yesterday after they tried to stage a demonstration against Chinese rule over the Himalayan region, Western witnesses said, Reuter reports. In the first open protest since last Friday, a group of up to 10 men brandishing Tibetan flags and shouting pro- independence slogans ran through crowds of pilgrims thronging Lhasa's Barkhor Square, the witnesses said by telephone. The men managed to make one full circuit of the Jokhang Temple, one of the holiest sites in Tibetan Buddhism, before they were surrounded by uniformed and plain-clothes police.</p>

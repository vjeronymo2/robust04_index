			<p><P> November 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REGIME REELS AS CZECHS PROTEST;  </P> <P> EAST BLOC: 200,000 MARCH IN PRAGUE. STATE-RUN MEDIA BROADCAST REPORTS CRITICAL  OF THE GOVERNMENT. A POWER STRUGGLE IS SEEN IN THE COMMUNIST PARTY.  </P> <P> As many as 200,000 protesters marched through central Prague on Monday in an  emotional groundswell of anti-government defiance that almost certainly  signaled the end of Stalinism in Czechoslovakia.  </P> <P> Demonstrations against the hard-line Communist regime of Milos Jakes also  spread for the first time to large provincial cities, including Bratislava,  Brno and Pilsen.  </P> <P> Protesters moved through the capital shouting "Freedom, freedom!" as bastions  of the hard-line Communist state began to crumble.  </P> <P> Suddenly on Monday evening, both Prague Radio and the state television began  carrying reports that aired sharp criticism of the government, while heads of  the capital's two largest universities expressed solidarity with a weeklong  anti-government student strike.  </P> <P> There also were signs of a split within the Communist Party hierarchy.  </P> <P> Prague Radio reported that the capital's party boss, Miroslav Stepan,  complained that many in the party were taking what he called "a neutral stand"  on the present turmoil and spoke of "certain symptoms of a power struggle."  </P> <P> Earlier, the country's leading dissident, Vaclev Havel, said he had received  what he called "feelers" from s enior figures within the regime.  </P> <P> "We are watching the end of Jakes," one veteran Western diplomat here declared.  "He has nothing left."  </P> <P> In a further blow to Jakes, East German leader Egon Krenz canceled plans to  visit Prague today. The move underscored the growing isolation of the  Czechoslovak regime, even among its Warsaw Pact allies.  </P> <P> Moscow went public with its disapproval of the regime last week, a move that  many analysts at the time believed sealed its fate.  </P> <P> Czechoslovak television on Monday read a government appeal for calm. It was  issued after an emergency plenary meeting of the national government, as well  as the Czech and Slovak regional governments.  </P> <P> The appeal noted that the government was in favor of dialogue to resolve the  country's problems, but said answers "could not be sought in an atmosphere of  emotions, passions and anti-socialist actions such as have occurred over the  past few days in Prague."  </P> <P> The appeal concluded by defending the brutal police action last Friday in  breaking up a student protest in Prague.  </P> <P> "No government in a legal state can suffer the violation of its constitution  and the laws of its country," it said.  </P> <P> However, the statement is expected to have little impact on the wave of  anti-government feeling rolling through Prague.  </P> <P> The United States has denounced the Friday crackdown, and on Monday it canceled  a proposed visit to Washington of party ideological chief Jan Fojtik. A State  Department statement said the visit would be inappropriate "because of the  violent police actions this past weekend during which scores of peaceful  demonstrators and U.S. and other international media representatives were  brutally beaten . . . ."  </P> <P> Among the banners and the sea of red, white and blue Czech flags carried by  marchers Monday, there was no longer fear, only the powerful scent of victory.  </P> <P> As they rallied first in the city's main Wenceslas Square, and later, as they  marched through adjoining streets, demonstrators shouted a slow, taunting,  "Jakes, Jakes" followed by a more direct chant of "Jakes out!" and "We want a  new government!"  </P> <P> One banner read, "We Want a Government With a Higher I.Q."  </P> <P> Riot police prevented marchers from approaching Prague Castle, residence of the  country's President Gustav Husak, a leading figure among the hard-liners who  took power in 1968. But there were no reported incidents of violence.  </P> <P> Residents and office workers along the route waved, applauded and hung their  own national flags from windows.  </P> <P> "Yesterday I thought it would take weeks for the government to resign. Today I  think it will be days," a 33-year-old research engineer in the crowd said.  </P> <P> Added an elderly woman in a voice heavy with emotion: "God help us all -- we've  waited 21 years for this."  </P> <P> It was 21 years ago that the Soviet Union and other Warsaw Pact forces invaded  Czechoslovakia to overthrow the liberal government of Alexander Dubcek and  place the present hard-liners in power.  </P> <P> The size of the demonstration and the dramatic change in content of the  state-controlled media surprised even the most seasoned diplomatic observers,  who admitted the pace of opposition to the country's hard-line leadership was  accelerating far faster than expected.  </P> <P> Hourly newscasts on official Prague Radio swung wildly, with the 4 p.m. news  summary carrying only bland official statements, while a similar summary one  hour later aired unprecedented direct and open criticism of the government.  </P> <P> Czechoslovaks sitting down to the main evening television news were stunned to  hear the government's loyal mouthpiece report that 200,000 of their fellow  citizens were in the streets of Prague expressing a lack of confidence in the  politicians, in the Communist Party and in the government of Czechoslovakia.  </P> <P> The newscast reported that both the dean of the Technical University and the  rector of Charles University, the country's largest, had decided to support  anti-government student strikes.  </P> <P> Czech television also reported that students and teachers in 29 Prague  secondary schools had agreed spontaneously to strike, but that students would  attend class "to hold a dialogue with teachers about subjects that could not  previously be discussed."  </P> <P> Earlier in the day, small, hand-typed signs appeared in subway stations and  store windows, announcing a two-hour general strike for next Monday.  </P> <P> Theaters, universities and secondary schools in the capital closed for a week  in protest against what is being referred to now as the "police massacre" of  students last Friday, and students' emissaries departed for regional cities in  the country to press for support.  </P> <P> The newspaper of the previously docile Socialist Party printed accounts of last  Friday's police attack on students and called for a "fundamental change in the  political climate." Newspapers in the capital were sold out virtually before  dawn Monday, and clusters of Czechoslovaks gathered to read copies of the  Socialist Party paper that were posted in public places.  </P> <P> There also were reports that coal miners in northern Bohemia had agreed to join  next Monday's general strike.  </P> <P> "There are no longer dissidents in the secret little ghettos," said dissident  leader Havel, referring to the small, isolated band of intellectuals that has  resisted the Communist leadership for the past decade.  </P> <P> "We're now in a time where there are the beginnings of a real opposition in our  country," he said. "It's the most important time in 20 years."  </P> <P> Havel announced the creation of a new opposition grouping called the Civic  Forum as a coalition of public interests prepared to negotiate with the  government about the crisis.  </P> <P> "Civic Forum came into existence last night, but I can't predict its future,"  he said.  </P> <P> Havel said any individual or group "that finds the need" could be part of it.  "It's open to all people who want democracy in this country," he added.  </P> <P> The new group issued an initial list of four demands, including the resignation  of those connected with the 1968 invasion of the country -- a list that would  include Jakes and Husak.  </P> <P> He said the organization could develop along the lines of East Germany's  opposition New Forum.  </P> <P> Havel also said a representative from miners in northern Bohemia had telephoned  him Sunday and said an appeal had been issued for all miners in the region to  join next Monday's strike. If the miners do join the protest, it would be  another ominous signal for the regime.  </P> <P> The bedrock of the government's support has long been an unspoken social  contract that workers would remain quiet as long as they were provided material  goods and a decent standard of living.  </P> <P> Czech economists privately claimed that Jakes has mortgaged the country's  future to keep Czechoslovak stores full.  </P> <P> Havel said he believed recent contacts he and other opposition leaders had  received from senior figures in the regime were a sign that the struggle within  the Communist Party for a successor to Jakes was now under way.  </P> <P> "Various power groups intending to go for the leadership are putting cards up  their sleeves, so that at the right time they can take them out to trump  others," he said.  </P> <P> He said the common characteristic of all the contacts was that opposition  interests "would be taken into account when the time comes."  </P> <P> "There are no facts, no specifics," he added. "There are even the moments when  they seem to be trying to emulate each other so they can say they were the  first to contact us."  </P> <P> </P> <P> BACKGROUND  </P> <P> The rise of a national crisis invariably draws Czechs to the heart of Prague, a  place dominated by an equestrian statue of St. Vaclav, a 10th-Century Bohemian  ruler who personifies the Czech nation. He is better known in the West through  the traditional Christmas carol as "Good King Wenceslas." The statue is  situated at the upper end of a gently sloping broad boulevard called Wenceslas  Square. It was there in 1968 that thousands gathered to voice support for the  "Prague Spring" reform movement that was crushed by Soviet tanks. A year later,  it served as the setting for one of the East Bloc's most dramatic protests  against Soviet domination, the self-immolation of university student Jan  Pallach. Now it is again the magnet for protests, this time for tens of  thousands demanding democratic reforms.  </P></p>

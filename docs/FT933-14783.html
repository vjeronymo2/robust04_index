			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Sky TV plans art and sport channels SKY TELEVISION is looking at the possibility of launching two new satellite channels next year - a second sports channel and an arts channel, Raymond Snoddy writes. Mr David Elstein, Sky's director of programmes, said the satellite broadcaster had rights to many more hours of sports coverage than it could get on a single channel. 'I also personally would like to see an arts channel,' said Mr Elstein. One of the main barriers to an arts channel showing largely UK performances would be agreement with Equity, the actors' union, and the Musicians Union on performance and copyright fees. Mr Elstein suggested yesterday that the performance unions could be involved in the channel and given 30 per cent of the equity instead of copyright payments. Sky Television, in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a significant interest, will start offering 14 channels in a subscription package from September, and hopes to increase this to as many as 20 channels by early next year.</p>

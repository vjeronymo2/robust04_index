			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / People: Succession settled at Schroders Schroders, the investment bank, announced yesterday that Win Bischoff, the current chief executive, is to succeed George Mallinckrodt as chairman of the group. Mallinkrodt has announced he will retire from the post next May and become president. He will remain on the board. Bischoff, seen as a driving force in strategy since his appointment as chief executive in 1984, will be partnered by Peter Sedgwick, chief executive of Schroder Investment Management, who will become vice-chairman. Mallinckrodt, who is connected with the Schroder family through his marriage to Charmaine Schroder, said yesterday that he had decided to retire as chairman in order to allow others in the group to move up to senior positions. 'People must have the opportunity to progress. You cannot have a chairman who sits at the top until he is 80 and blocks people,' says Mallinckrodt, 64, who will maintain links with international clients as president. Sedgwick, who has developed the bank's asset management arm into one of its most valuable operations, will become vice chairman on January 1. Mallinckrodt says he and Bischoff would form a 'partnership' at the helm of the group. Jean Solandt, who heads treasury and trading, will become chairman of J. Henry Schroder Wagg, the merchant bank, and chair the group executive committee. William Slee and David Challen will be joint vice-chairman of the merchant bank. John Govett will become chairman of Schroder Investment Management, and Hugh Bolland and David Salisbury will be joint chief executives of SIM. Andrew Sykes is to succeed Jean Solandt as head of treasury and trading in London. Mallinckrodt says the changes, on which he has been working with Bischoff since last December, were meant to be 'as easy and evolutionary as possible' and reflected the need for a broader management structure to reflect the bank's growth.</p>

Compared with the previous years, investment on the mainland in  1993 by Taiwan businessmen extended to more localities, and the  sectors and scale of investment further expanded -- long-term  investment began to increase and Taiwan's large consortiums and  enterprises speeded up studies of the mainland's investment  climate and quickened the pace of their investment. According  to statistics provided by concerned departments, as of October  1993, the mainland had approved the establishment of more than  15,100 Taiwan-funded enterprises, with a total investment figure  of more than $13.6 billion. Many people of insight in Taiwan's  business circles point out that economic cooperation between the  mainland and Taiwan has become an extremely important factor in  Taiwan's further economic development.    Taiwan business investment on the mainland in 1993 had the  following distinct characteristics:    1. The areas in which investment is being made continued to  grow quickly, spreading from the southeast coastal area to the  entire coastal area as well as to some inland provinces.  Taiwan-invested enterprises in the areas along the Chang Jiang,  along the coastal area of the Bo Hai, and in inland provinces  increased noticeably, and they also began to appear in such  remote areas as Qinghai and Tibet. According to statistics  compiled by the foreign economic relations and trade commissions  of the four cities along the coastal area of the Bo Hai --  Tianjin, Dalian, Qinhuangdao, and Qingdao -- in January and  February last year, the four cities approved a total of more  than 700 Taiwan investment projects, with a total investment  figure of more than $600 million. In areas along the Chang  Jiang, Shanghai approved 482 direct Taiwan investment projects  during the January-September period worth a total of $430  million, exceeding the total number of Taiwan investment  projects and the total investment figure for the preceding 5  years combined. Both the number of Taiwan investment projects  and volume of investment approved by Anhui in 1993 increased  several fold over the year before. Jiangsu is now the province  with the largest number of Taiwan-invested enterprises. Taiwan  investments in Sichuan, Jiangxi, and other inland provinces also  increased by a large margin compared with previous years.  Northeast China has begun to become a hot spot for Taiwan  investment -- Liaoning Province alone approved the establishment  of more than 300 Taiwan-funded enterprises during the  January-September period, more than the combined total of the  previous 9 years.    2. Taiwan investment was spread over a greater area and  long-term investment increased. In addition to the  labor-intensive processing industries, which were the major  target of Taiwan industrial business investment on the mainland  in the early years, investment has now begun to shift to capital  and technology-intensive modern industries; to the  transportation, energy, and communications industries; and to  other infrastructural facilities. Taiwan businessmen established  on the mainland some new and high- technology enterprises such  as plasma cutting machine manufacturing, laser products, silicon  rubber, printed circuit boards, and a few bioengineering  ventures. Also, foreseeing a prosperous market on the mainland,  Taiwan's home electrical appliance and computer industry began  to invest in many areas of the mainland. And, Taiwan investment  also began to enter the financial, real estate, and other  sectors on the mainland. Last year, Taiwan's financial  institutions began to open offices in Shenzhen and other  localities. The B-type shares issued by the Xiamen Shankun  Industrial Company, a company solely owned by Taiwan  compatriots, were listed at the Shenzhen Stock Exchange in  mid-1993, making the company the first listed Taiwan enterprise  on the mainland. Also, over the last few years, Taiwan  investment on the mainland has focused on the purchase of  factories and the right to use land as well as on building  factories and dormitories; quite a few Taiwan investors have  chosen to settle on the mainland and therefore have taken the  initiative in planning long-term enterprise development  strategies.    3. The scale of Taiwan investment reached a new level. The  structure of Taiwan industrial investment on the mainland has  also changed. Various surveys show that Taiwan investment on  the mainland has not only has entered capital-intensive and  high-technology industries and other long-term investment  projects, but has also been injected into large, complex  investment projects involving various industrial sectors --  Taiwan investment on the mainland has begun to be diversified.  According to statistics released by Taiwan's "Council for  Economic Planning and Development," 64 percent of Taiwan's  manufacturing industrial enterprises have invested in the  mainland; the volume of their investment on the mainland totaled  $2.65 billion in the first 8 months of 1993, 14 times the figure  for the same period in 1992. In Shenzhen, where the density of  Taiwan investment is the highest, Taiwan investment has begun to  shift to large and medium enterprises, with petrochemical and  rubber industries leading the way. Taiwan's Tongyi Group and  Weiquan Group, which are the leaders in Taiwan's food industry,  have established solely-owned or co- invested food enterprises  in various provinces and municipalities. Some of Taiwan's large  enterprises have changed the "hit and run" experimental  investment strategy they practiced at first and have begun  long-term planning aimed at long-term development on the  mainland. On the other hand, Taiwan investment in similar  industries have become relatively concentrated in some  localities, with the establishment of Taiwan industrial zones  and processing zones. For example, Taiwan's Juda Bicycle  Company and its satellite companies established a "bicycle  production special zone" in Jiangsu's Kunshan city; the Taiwan  Toy Association developed a "toy industrial city" in Zhejiang's  Yuyao county; the Taipei City Computer Association established a  "computer street" in Shanghai; and the Taiwan Machine-Building  Association has plans to establish the "Taiwan Machine-Building  Special Zone" in Zhejiang's Xiaoshan county. From these  developments, Taiwan's economic sector has drawn this  conclusion: Taiwan investment on the mainland has begun to  increase in scale and has become more group-based.    A survey conducted by Taiwan's China Economic Research  Institute shows that every U.S. dollar of Taiwan investment on  the mainland will create $2 in output value for Taiwan's economy  and that Taiwan investment on the mainland has become one of the  major driving forces of Taiwan's economic development. An  official of a well-known Taiwan consortium said frankly: "The  mainland has abundant resources and the markets there are  becoming increasingly attractive. Therefore, whether we are  seeking development or trying to expand domestic and overseas  markets, investing in the mainland has all the advantages." For  this reason, people in both the mainland and Taiwan business  circles expect that, as economic and trade exchanges across the  strait increase, and as mutually- complementary and  mutually-beneficial, cross-strait economic relations are being  gradually established, Taiwan investment on the mainland will  reach new heights, and that this will push cross-strait economic  cooperation to a new stage.</p>

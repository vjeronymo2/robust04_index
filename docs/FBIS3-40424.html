			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Troubleshooting With Neural Networks </F> -- How Siemens Checks Chips;" first paragraph is COMPUTER  ZEITUNG introduction]    [Text] The number of defects that can occur in the  complicated circuitry when chips are being manufactured is hard  to imagine, and they are difficult to detect. An inspection  process with neural intelligence now recognizes faulty  minimemories in a flash.    Who can imagine a number with a million zeros? Expressed in  milligrams, the weight of the Earth needs a 30 digit number.  The number of atoms in the entire universe has about 125 places  - but a million? Siemens engineers have to get to grips with  this giant number if properly working silicon chips are to leave  the factory in Regensburg: In theory 2[.sup]4194304[/]-1  reference patterns can occur in the production of a 4 megabit  memory, a number with approximately 1.2 million digits. "Maps",  better known as "bit-maps" showing specimen faulty memories are  used to try to classify this almost infinite number of reference  patterns in order to cut the time required for inspecting a  silicon wafer with memory modules.    At first sight it is a never-ending task: How can this huge  number of possible combinations be classified at all?  Fortunately, the bit-map variants are similar in appearance.  Someone with a sound background knowledge who "reads" the  bit-maps for a long period of time can divide them into some 80  to 100 risk allowance groups. This is an extraordinary  achievement for the human brain. There is just one snag: Visual  analysis takes up to 15 hours for every 6-inch silicon wafer.    Siemens in Regensburg has now optimized bit-map analysis of  silicon wafers with neural networks. The computer uses pattern  recognition to decide in which of the 80 or so risk allowance  groups a defect found on a chip falls. The actual analysis is  performed on a perfectly ordinary PC. One great advantage is  that any new reference patterns that occur no longer have to be  reprogrammed because the system "learns" them itself. And that  is not all: Since most of the equipment used in chip manufacture  has quite characteristic reference patterns, the system gives a  specific alarm when faults of a particular risk allowance group  accumulate in part of the wafer. This enables such "output  killers" to be identified early.    The bit-map analysis system developed by Siemens'  Semiconductor Division will also check 16 megabit and later 64  megabit memories: The number of possible reference patterns in  these memories is as much as 2[.sup]108864[/]-1. To write  this number out would require a computer printout which, with  the pages placed end to end, would be 100 kilometers long.</p>

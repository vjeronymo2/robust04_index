			<p><P> March 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Four-term socialist Mayor Bernard Sanders' party won another victory in  Burlington, Vt., as former community development director Peter Clavelle  defeated Alderman Nancy Chioffi to become Sanders' successor. Clavelle, the  Progressive Coalition candidate, had 5,626 ballots, or 52% of the vote, to  4,400, or 41%, for Democrat Chioffi, a store owner who also had Republican  backing, according to unofficial results. Sanders -- often billed as the  nation's only socialist mayor -- had decided against another term.  </P></p>

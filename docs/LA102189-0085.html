			<p><P> October 21, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> STUDENT SUES STADIUM GUARDS, FIRM OVER SCUFFLE AT SDSU GAME;  </P> <P> COURTS: $2 MILLION SOUGHT BY FRATERNITY MEMBER WHO CLAIMS HIS NECK WAS BROKEN  DURING EVICTION.  </P> <P> A college student who allegedly suffered a broken neck during a scuffle with  security guards at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium filed a $2-million lawsuit  Friday against the guards and their employer.  </P> <P> John Kellogg, a San Diego State University student, alleged that security guard  Robert Babauta kicked him, repeatedly threw him to the concrete floor, and  picked him up by the hair while he was handcuffed after he stopped to buy a  chocolate chip cookie while he was being kicked out of the stadium.  </P> <P> Kellogg, 21, was among a group of about 18 Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity members  who were being evicted for alleged rowdiness during the UCLA-SDSU football game  on Sept. 16.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Others Named  </P> <P> In addition to Babauta, the lawsuit names the company, Pro-Tect Professional  Service, owner Peter Hayes, guard Ralph Bruck and 100 John Does as defendants.  The complaint charges the company, Hayes and the guards with negligence,  assault and battery, and false imprisonment.  </P> <P> According to the lawsuit filed in Superior Court, Kellogg suffered a broken  neck and injury to his nervous system which "will result in some permanent  disability." The suit also alleges that Pro-Tect attempted to cover up the  incident by filing false reports with SDSU officials and state and local  agencies that regulate security firms.  </P> <P> The incident was witnessed by Lyle Van Gessel, owner of a printed-circuit  design company. In an interview Friday, Gessel, 46, said he was at the  concession stand, waiting to buy beer, when Kellogg and the other fraternity  members were being escorted out of the stadium by a group of guards.  </P> <P> Kellogg and another fraternity member attempted to buy chocolate chip cookies  at the stand, when one or both of them were shoved by guards, who told the  pair, "It isn't lunch time," Gessel said. At that point, Kellogg apparently  attempted a getaway by dashing toward a nearby elevator, Gessel said.  </P> <P> "I got my beers and went and looked in the elevator. . . . One security guy  came out holding onto the back of (Kellogg's) collar, flinging him around. The  fellow went to the ground. He was handcuffed, so he couldn't break his fall. He  (Babauta) picked him up and threw him to the ground four times. The guy was  handcuffed the entire time. I started screaming at (Babauta) and yelled, 'You  Gestapo son of a bitch, leave him alone,' " Gessel said.  </P> <P> One of Kellogg's fraternity brothers came along and began yelling at Babauta to  leave Kellogg alone, Gessel added. Babauta then dropped Kellogg to the floor,  and took off after the unknown student. As he ran after the student, Babauta  yelled, "You want some of the same?" Gessel said.  </P> <P> By this time Kellogg, who is 5-foot-5 and weighs 130 pounds, was crying and in  hysterics, Gessel said.  </P> <P> "(Kellogg) was bawling his head off. He was screaming, 'Leave me alone!' The  kid's handcuffed and they're beating . . . him. I don't know what went on in  the elevator, but the kid was 100% subdued when he came out of the elevator. He  was not resisting," Gessel said.  </P> <P> As the incident unfolded, Gessel said, he kept asking other security guards to  take his name, because he had witnessed the alleged beating. However, nobody  responded until a supervisor came by and encouraged him to file a complaint,  Gessel said.  </P> <P> "The supervisor told me, 'Please go file a complaint. We need to stop this sort  of thing,' " Gessel said.  </P> <P> When he filed the complaint against Babauta that night at the stadium, Gessel  said, other guards refused to give him Babauta's badge number until another  supervisor interceded and told him that Babauta's badge number was 165.  </P> <P> "I didn't see any other security guards do anything out of line. Some of them  were rather flippant in their responses, but others were extremely helpful. . .  . I think that criminal charges should be filed against (Babauta)," Gessel  said.  </P> <P> Although Kellogg refused to talk to police after the incident, defense  investigator Manny Lopez said a complaint will be filed against Babauta and the  security company next week with San Diego police.  </P> <P> Pro-Tect owner Hayes declined to comment on the lawsuit because he had not seen  a copy of it.  </P> <P> "But standard operating procedure is to forward it to the insurance company.  Several years later I'll hear from the attorneys what happened in the case,"  said Hayes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Still Employed  </P> <P> He added that Babauta and Bruck, who could not be reached for comment on  Friday, are still employed by his firm. Hayes said that one of the two men was  not present on the night of the incident, but he declined to identify him.  </P> <P> In an interview two weeks after the incident, Hayes said that Kellogg was in a  rowdy student group that had been walking around the stadium "kicking trash  cans and intimidating women in restroom lines."  </P></p>

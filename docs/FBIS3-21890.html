The room was bathed in  fierce lights, stiflingly hot, and crammed with thriving  marijuana plants.    Paul Eden, of Crawley, West Sussex, was jailed for 12 months  last year after he was found cultivating cannabis at home.  High-powered bulbs threw heat and light off white-washed walls  onto the rows of plants, which were bedded into heated tanks and  fed by a continuous water supply. The room was strung with lines  on which buds gently dried.    Police say that such sophisticated set-ups are thriving  across Britain. The home-grown operations of the old hippie  generation, hampered by a damp climate and lack of technical  expertise, have been replaced by a new wave of growers using  high-tech methods.    Seizures of cannabis plants more than trebled in  Northamptonshire last year; in the West Midlands, one smoker was  found to have grown 45 kilos of the drug at his allotment near  Walsall. This month detectives found a cannabis "factory" in a  twelfth-floor flat in a Glasgow block. In West Yorkshire, seven  "skunk farms"--named after a powerful marijuana strain developed  in Holland for home-growing--have been closed down since the  beginning of 1993.    Much of the merchandise involved in the production of  marijuana is openly advertised, promoted and sold in Britain. At  Tower Records in London, books giving detailed instructions on  growing cannabis are on sale. For &pound;9.99, customers can  purchase The Closet Cultivator, "written by the foremost expert  of cannabis cultivation".    Seeds of new cannabis varieties--such as Super Skunk, Silver  Haze and Big Bud--are marketed from Holland in glossy brochures  giving descriptions of their potency, yield, growing time and  price. "Possession of the seeds is not illegal so there is not a  lot we can do about it," said a customs spokesman.    In Viz, the top-selling comic popular with students, a crude  drawing of a Rastafarian is used to illustrate an advertisement  for "home-grown pot plants." It is not just students that police  find tending their cannabis plants. Alan Derrett, 70, a former  Rolls-Royce engineer, was given a conditional discharge earlier  this month after telling a Bristol court that the 36 cannabis  plants in his garden were to combat his "hypertension."    Release, the legal and drug advice agency, has received an  unprecedented number of calls from people seeking help after  being raided by police for cultivating cannabis. "They are  saying, `this is my private life and the law has no place in it  because it is not harming other people,'" said Alisdair Cant, a  spokesman.    Police officers are less convinced, however. Paul Kyberd of  the Thames Valley drug squad, warned of the potency of the new  cannabis strains. "One guy said he inhaled skunk and it was just  like a great big wave, almost knocking him over."    The growth in cannabis production coincides with a fierce  debate over penalties for drug offences. In Scotland, the  government is considering bringing in fixed penalties for  cannabis possession that would not lead to a criminal record.    THE SUNDAY TIMES revealed last week that Michael Howard, the  home secretary, is planning to increase the fine for possession  of cannabis five-fold to &pound;2,500 in England and Wales.

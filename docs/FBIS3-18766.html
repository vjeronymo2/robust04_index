			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Agriculture Needs 2 Billion Extra"] </F>   [Text] Agriculture will need additional support of almost  2 billion markkas next year if Finland joins the European Union  [EU]. This was the assessment given by Foreign Minister Heikki  Haavisto in Sunday's [6 March] TURUN SANOMAT.    According to Haavisto, the transition to the EU's pricing  system means that the production price of certain products will  be halved and the value of stockpiled products will fall.    According to Haavisto, 3 to 4 billion markkas in national  agricultural support will be needed after the transitional  period. This year direct support to agriculture will be 6.5  billion markkas.    In TURUN SANOMAT Haavisto gave concrete figures for the  additional support that Prime Minister Esko Aho said he believed  would be necessary in the Eduskunta on Friday. Social  Democratic circles have already been fairly critical of calls  for additional support. The matter could also cause conflict in  the government, since Foreign Trade Minister Pertti Salolainen,  the National Coalition Party chairman, has said that current  levels of agricultural support ought to suffice even in a period  of transition to the EU.    For his part Interior Minister Mauri Pekkarinen indicated on  Sunday his readiness to finance the additional expense of EU  membership by taking additional loans.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Avraham Katz-'Oz, head of the Israeli </F> delegation to the Omani Water Affairs Committee, by Arye Gus, in  Muscat on 19 April -- recorded]    [Text] [Katz-'Oz] From Israel's viewpoint it was a very  successful meeting. We achieved all the aims we set for  ourselves. If the next meeting takes place in Bahrain or Kuwait,  as expected, another of the five or six main targets we came  here with will be met. The Americans also achieved all their  aims. I believe we have moved from the stage of general  deliberations by experts to that of starting to implement  projects in the field. In his concluding remarks, the chairman  referred to five projects on which work will now begin. One is  an American project dealing with waste waters from small  settlements through chemical treatment, and then the reuse of  the water. That will be a joint project by two groups -- the  environment group and the water group.    [Gus] That was, of course, the start of cooperation with  Oman.    [Katz-'Oz] Not only that, it also found expression in the  chairman's closing remarks. In other words, it is on record  that Israel is a member of the steering committee, which will be  based in Oman, and that Israel will contribute to desalination  projects using solar energy within the framework of the Omani  center, which will have a branch in Israel.    [Gus] What is next?    [Katz-'Oz] We should look at it as part of Israel's overall  interest in the water group. Together with all the other  international elements, we are slowly moving toward an overall  solution of the Middle East's water problems, for the  Palestinians, Jordanians, and Israelis, outside the existing  water distribution framework, through the creation of additional  water for the future.    [Gus] Israel did not oppose the establishment of a  Palestinian national water authority. What caused the reversal  in the Israeli position?    [Katz-'Oz] The Declaration of Principles includes a number  of authorities to be set up, including land, water, and military  authorities. As part of that framework, we, of course, did not  oppose the establishment of the water authority. The bilateral  working group will deal with the details of how and when it will  be set up.</p>

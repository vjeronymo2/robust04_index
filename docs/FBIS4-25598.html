			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Yang Liu (2799 2692)] </F>   [Text] In order to resolve the increasingly serious problem  that railway transportation capacity has not kept pace with  speedy economic development, over one million railway workers  are presently working on large railway projects in the north,  east, center, south, and northwest of China. This year, China  will mainly work on 10 major railway projects and is now  planning three other railway projects.    In an interview with this staff reporter yesterday, Wang  Chengzhi, an official of the Planning Department of China's  Ministry of Railways, said that this year, the central  authorities have allocated over 40 billion yuan to the Ministry  of Railways for new investment plans, some 10 billion yuan more  than last year. Moreover, the funds are for key state guaranteed  projects.    The central authorities have given "military decrees" to  Baotou, Anshan, and Panzhi, the three large iron and steel  corporations charging them with the task of producing millions  of tons of tracks and supplying them for use in the  Beijing-Kowloon railway, which stretches some 2,538 kilometers.  Moreover, additional track will be procured from abroad.    China's 10 major railway projects are: The Beijing-Kowloon  railway (which connects to Kowloon), the Baoji-Zhongwei  (Shaanxi's Baoji-Ningxia's Zhongwei) railway, the Lan-Xin  (Gansu's Wuwei-Xinjiang's Urumqi) railway, the electric railway  project for the Chengdu-Kunming railway, the Nanning-Kunming  railway, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi double-track (Hangzhou-Zhuzhou  section) railway, the Beijing-Guangzhou railway expansion  project, the Hou-Yue (Shanxi's Houma-Henan's Yueshan) railway,  the Xian-Ankang railway, and the Datong-Qinhuangdao railway.    Wang said: In addition to that, the Ministry of Railways is  planning to build a 710-km railway from Nanjing to Wuhan along  the Chang Jiang. There are already railways in both Nanjing and  Wuhan, but between them is only the 237-km railway along the  banks of the Chang Jiang from Anhui's Tongling to Jiangxi's  Jiujiang. Therefore, the state has recently approved building  of a new railway along the Chang Jiang.    He said: The project on the Nanjing-Wuhan railway, which  runs along the Chang Jiang, is expected to be started next year  and put into operation by 1998. At that time, the railway will  link the Beijing-Shanghai, the Anhui-Jiangxi, the  Beijing-Kowloon, and the Beijing-Guangzhou railways, and will  shorten the current railway transportation mileage between Wuhan  and Shanghai by over 200 km and alleviate the increasingly heavy  sea transportation along the Chang Jiang.    Wang said: The Ministry of Railways also plans to build two  special passenger railways running between Beijing and Shanghai  and between Shenyang and Qinhuangdao. The Beijing-Shanghai  route will stretch for 1,460 kilometers and entail an investment  of 70 billion yuan, and the Shenyang-Qinhuangdao route will  stretch for 430 kilometers and entail an investment of over 10  billion yuan. There are plans to use foreign capital for the  two routes.</p>

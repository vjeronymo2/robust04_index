			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Survey of Merseyside (2): Partnership tackles region's image  -How companies have been persuaded to put their money where their mouths are Money talks. It speaks of harmony: Merseyside's politicians, civil servants, business leaders, academics, government agencies and local coun- cils are nearly all paying about Pounds 1m between them for hymn sheets to sing from. It is the best evidence yet that they have stopped dithering and intend to make their Mersey Partnership work. 'They have not just signed up, but have put in substantial sums,' says Mr Jack Stopforth, a Liverpool marketing consultant. 'It shows just how much attitudes have changed.' The partnership wants to mount a sustained campaign to market Merseyside around the world. 'We think we will need about Pounds 11m over six years,' says Mr Chris Gibaud, the partnership's chief executive. 'We are asking the EU for 47 per cent of it.' His organisation has had a difficult birth. Successful partnerships for economic development elsewhere have depended on a willing marriage of public and private sectors. Liverpool's confront- ational politics in the 1980s drove the local private sector away from even contemplating it. As the politics stabilised, a hesitant, argumentative court- ship began about four years ago. There were problems finding and keeping the right chairman, but the partnership eventually appointed an impressive chief executive. Mr Gibaud, who learned his economic development skills in securing inward investment for Swindon and Peterborough - and paradoxically in failing to get city challenge status for Widnes and Runcorn - is now running the show in tandem with Mr David Henshaw, chief executive of Knowsley borough council, as chairman. Mr Geoffrey Piper, chief executive of the private sector's powerful North West Business leadership team - a grouping of the region's largest and most successful companies - takes over the chair in six months' time, but he and Mr Henshaw may then rotate the job. Formerly a senior partner with Coopers Deloitte, Mr Piper used to run Boom - Business Opportunities on Merseyside. It was supported by a large number of companies at Pounds 250 a year each, to try to counter the troubled image of Merseyside in the political turmoil of the 1980s. Since then, Mr Gibaud has argued the time has come for all parties to put their money where their mouths are: the more people paid, the greater would be their commitment and the more their endeavour would be worth. The membership list tells the story. There are four categories:- A - local authorities, contributing money or support in kind worth Pounds 100,000 each. B - major subscribers: Merseyside Development Corporation, Merseyside Training and Enterprise Council, and Manweb, the regional electricity company. They pay Pounds 150,000 each. C - large subscribers, including Liverpool's two universities, Merseytravel, Royal Insurance, which pay Pounds 50,000 each. Contributions in this category range from Pounds 20,000. D - smaller subscribers paying a minimum Pounds 5,000. Nearly 25 companies have signed up so far, with new ones joining at one a month. Merseyside's city challenge teams fit into this category. Mr Gibaud says: 'People want their money's worth, so commitment is high. We have formed a steering group from all the members. Categories A and B get automatic repres- entation. Categories C and D elect one member per Pounds 100,000 of total subscriptions in their groups. There is real compet- ition for the elected places.' Specialists are co-opted when their personal contribution can be telling, such as the PR director of Royal Insurance and the finance director of Manweb. There are worries in some quarters that the partnership may compete with Inward, the north-west region's inward investment agency, and that there may be some confusion over one Merseyside borough - Wirral - making its own partnership arrangements with local large employers. But there is enough goodwill for no one to want to be quoted on this, in case it looks like an attempt to create disharmony. 'We are concerned with the image and marketing of Mer- seyside. We are not trying to do anyone else's job,' Mr Henshaw says. 'The Objective 1 programme is Merseyside's last chance. If we cannot get a leap in perception, we will have failed. Ten years ago there was a lot of negativity; there is now an empty canvas. We have a chance to paint our own picture.' Mr Alan Chape, deputy chief executive, of Liverpool city council, says: 'We have still got a drag factor on our image. A lot of it is London-based. Intermediaries will not put Merseyside on their lists for possible relocation or invest- ment.' Mr Gibaud points out: 'We have done some of our best work so far in London during the last year and have made good contacts.' Thus Mr Paul Newall, lord mayor of London, visited Merseyside recently with Mr Tamon Kitabatake, commercial minister at the Japanese Embassy. Since then, Mr Newall has been extolling the virtues of Merseyside at meetings in the UK and abroad. Mr Gibaud says it is a good start.</p>

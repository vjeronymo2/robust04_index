A zero tax rate will be applicable to export  commodities, which means once a product has been declared at  customs and exported, all tax payments will be refunded.    According to the current VAT, sales of the following goods  are subject to a low tax rate: (1) grains and edible vegetable  oil; (2) water, central heating, air conditioning, hot water,  coal gas, liquefied petroleum gas, natural gas, methane, and  household-use coal-related products; (3) books, newspapers, and  magazines; (4) foodstuff, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, farm  machinery, and agriculture-use vinyl sheets; and (5) other  merchandise as may be prescribed by the State Council. A  13-percent tax rate has been fixed on the aforementioned goods,  be they sold by industry or commerce.    Sales tax is arrived at by multiplying the sales amount by  the fixed VAT rate. Sales tax is to be computed by the seller  according to the fixed rate. Purchase tax refers to the tax  amount stated in a purchase invoice when an enterprise pays for  the goods, including the sales tax paid at a previous taxation  stage for the goods purchased. The sales tax paid by an  enterprise minus the purchase tax will be the taxable amount.  When a taxable amount is in the negative, it may be offset in  the next transaction. The sales amount mentioned above is  exclusive of tax.    Which type of purchase tax amount is not deductible from the  sales tax? Specifically, this includes the following  categories: (1) purchases of fixed assets; (2) purchases of  goods or taxable services not for use by an enterprise in its  commodity production or not for resale; (3) purchases of goods  or taxable services by an enterprise for use in production of  duty-free commodities; (4) purchases of goods or taxable  services for collective welfare or personal consumption; (5)  purchased goods sustaining losses due to damage not through  normal wear and tear; (6) purchased goods or taxable services  used in unfinished or finished products sustaining losses due to  damage not through normal wear and tear.</p>

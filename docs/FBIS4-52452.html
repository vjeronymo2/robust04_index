			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Commenting to newsmen about  the clash between Cambodian Government and foreign forces and  the Cambodian remark that the foreign force was Thai, Army  Commander General Wimon Wongwanit said the Cambodian side made  such a claim to justify the reality that the Cambodian force has  not been able to defeat the Khmer Rouge. Another motive of the  claim is to appeal for various kinds of international support.  He said the Army has always asserted that it will not interfere  in Cambodian internal affairs because Thailand wants to see  peace in Cambodia.</p>

It accused Russia of interfering in Afghan internal  affairs and of supporting the latter.    But the Afghan president told AL-HAYAH over the telephone  that he rejects any proposals to internationalize the crisis in  his country. He stressed that he would not relinquish power  even if international military intervention takes place against  him. [passage omitted]    Furthermore, Afghan President Borhanoddin Rabbani stressed  that his forces are in control of the strategic city of Baghlan  and the surrounding areas in northern Afghanistan. He said that  Uzbek militia forces and Hezb-e Eslami forces have surrendered  with all their military equipment to government forces.    In his statement to AL-HAYAH yesterday Rabbani rejected any  offers to internationalize the Afghan crisis, because "it is  primarily an Islamic problem and concerns Islamic institutions,  organizations, and states." Rabbani denied that he intends to  submit his resignation. He said, "I will not submit my  resignation except after the remaining six months of my term  have elapsed. I will not step down even if military and  international intervention takes place. Because I refuse to  surrender to pressure, conspiracies, and broken pledges. I am  here because I was selected by all Afghan leaders."    Rabbani pointed out that "so far all mediations have failed  to find a solution to the problem or secure a cease-fire."

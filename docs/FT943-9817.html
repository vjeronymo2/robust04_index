			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Smith's short sight Even by the standards of 1988, when countless companies struck deals their shareholders lived to regret, Smith &amp; Nephew's acquisition of Ioptex was an expensive blunder. At the exchange rates then prevailing it paid Pounds 140m for a company that is now being sold for just Pounds 11m. After writing-down the company's assets, there is a total loss of Pounds 148m which represents almost three years' dividends and a third of shareholders' funds. In retrospect the acquisition was breathtakingly risky. Smith &amp; Nephew paid over five times annual sales for the number four player in a market that was fast going ex-growth. The deal was so structured that despite the high price the acquisition would not dilute earnings in the first year. Maybe the ingenuity of the financial engineering blinded management to the dangers. They should certainly have questioned whether margins approaching 45 per cent were sustainable in a mature US market, or whether Smith could add anything to Ioptex's attempts to expand internationally. It was dismissing the regulatory threat that was to prove most damaging, since the price controls placed on some lenses by the US authorities 18 months later were a blow from which Ioptex never really recovered. Smith stresses that all its other US acquisitions have been successful and that it has learned hard lessons from Ioptex. If this reassures shareholders, who have seen dividends rise by just 15 per cent over the past five years, they may still wonder why over the same period the pay of Smith &amp; Nephew's successive chief executives has doubled.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Thankmar von Muenchhausen: "Between Ill </F> Feelings and Understanding"]    [Text] Ill feelings in an alliance is one reason to look  at what has been achieved and to create clarity for the future.  This also applies to the recent irritation between Germany and  France that was cleared up after some discussion. Those who  were involved in Paris and Bonn are being reminded of the  importance of cooperation that proved its worth in the past  three decades. Yet, the two partners are also becoming aware of  the difference in interests.    Trying to analyze the ill feelings that have been revealed  by  the controversial statements of the French ambassador in Bonn  brings back to mind former concerns in connection with German  unification and the emergence of a larger Germany that could be  heard from the political class in France after the fall of the  wall. It was the old fear of the "German uncertainties" and a  special German course toward the East.    Those who are looking for confirmation for this latent fear  in France will have no trouble finding it. Foreign Minister  Genscher's pressing for international recognition of the  constituent republics of the disintegrating Yugoslavia was seen  as German efforts to acquire a status of supremacy in the  Balkans. Similarly, one could challenge the federal  chancellor's efforts to facilitate the Central and East European  countries' move to get closer to the West: Where Germany pleads  for cooperation on behalf of European stability, it might be  trying to protect its own "lebensraum" on the basis of  institutions. The discussion on enlargement and/or deepening of  the European Union [EU], which is also being conducted between  Bonn and Paris, is more than splitting hairs. It indicates  differences in the dynamism.    After the shock caused by unification, the terrified French  found solace in the fact that the cost of it had a greater  impact on Germany's economic strength than they had envisaged,  and that they were hence left with fewer means for  economic-political expansion. Those who looked further ahead  realized very soon that such a consolation would become less  significant as the years went by, and that what started out as a  handicap would be transformed into a competitive advantage  before long. Even now, trade with the East accounts for 6-7  percent of German foreign trade, while in the case of France, it  is only 2.5 percent. The hesitation of the French oil concern,  Elf Aquitaine, to tackle the reconstruction of the Leuna  refinery, the biggest foreign investment in the new laender, is  only one example of the difficulties on the new markets. France  lacks the economic possibilities of restimulating the "Little  Entente," the French sphere of influence between the German  Reich and the Soviet Union in the era between the two wars.  Independent of historic experiences and sympathies, governments  and enterprises in the former East bloc are principally banking  on the Germans.    In this unusual situation after the end of the bipartition  of  Europe, the German Government has only one chance of weakening  latent distrust, which exists not only in France: the readiness  for close cooperation with the partners, especially with our  neighbor France. Foreign Minister Kinkel emphasized this  readiness in a programmatic speech in Paris and rejected "solo  actions and special paths" and "thinking in terms of spheres of  influence." The four-year-old offer for Franco-German  coordination in the sphere of ostpolitik, which has not been  sufficiently used so far, was extended by the German foreign  minister to the EU: a rewarding task for the desired identity of  united Europe, which is to go beyond the level of trade.    What has been defined as the horizon by the German planners  in careful agreement with Paris is not limited to the Central  European reformist states and the Baltic Republics but, taking  economic facts into account, also includes Russia and Ukraine.  Time is short. The year in which Germany and then France will  have the presidency in the Union provides the timeframe. With  some exaggeration, one could conclude that de Gaulle's vision of  a Europe "from the Atlantic to the Urals" is being taken more  seriously today in Bonn than in Paris. Still, the German side  is trying to avoid the impression of being fixed too much on  ostpolitik. The federal foreign minister has, therefore, called  for an active European policy in the Mediterranean, which was  the declared objective of President Mitterrand when he first  took office. The Islamic danger in Algeria shows that this  cause is most urgent but also very risky.    It is one of the good sides in the Franco-German  relationship  that the worries about the effects of German ostpolitik, which  date back to the era of Bismarck, also have a positive effect  for France: the understanding that Germany may pursue interests  of its own in the East without bad intentions. Out of "reason  of state" and a sense for "realpolitik," French politicians,  based on their own experience, do show understanding, even with  a slight connotation of resignation. The fact that the German  view has changed since the dissolution of the East bloc is a  matter of course for the French and has been accepted. In the  view of the French, joint action has become very important,  particularly because new possibilities have emerged for the  Germans.</p>

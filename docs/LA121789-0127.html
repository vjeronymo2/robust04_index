			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SOCKERS LET ANOTHER ONE GET AWAY IN FINAL PERIOD  </P> <P> The Sockers' old formula for success was working well. Get a lead, force the  opponents to come out and then punish them.  </P> <P> It was going like clockwork. They had the Wichita Wings chasing shadows as they  controlled the ball with crisp, one-touch passing.  </P> <P> But in the final period, the Wings used high pressure and Chico Borja to score  three goals for a 5-4 victory Saturday night.  </P> <P> Kevin Crow, the Sockers' two-time MISL defender of the year, said losing late  has been the story of the season for the Sockers.  </P> <P> "A lot of games we've lost, we've been the better team for the first three  quarters," he said. "We haven't proved to each other that we can suck it up and  play as well in the fourth quarter as we do in the rest of the game, and it's  hurting us."  </P> <P> The loss dropped the Sockers (7-8) 2 1/2 games behind Dallas in the MISL  Western Division.  </P> <P> Closing out an opponent traditionally has been a Socker trademark. Crow said  it's not as easy as it once was.  </P> <P> "The league is getting more competitive," he said. "We're not going into the  fourth quarter with as big a lead as we used to."  </P> <P> Some players play well in the clutch. That's been the story of the season for  Borja, who scored the game-winner with 3:24 remaining. He has had the  game-winning goal or assist in seven of the Wings' nine victories and leads the  league in pressure points (goals or assists scored in the fourth quarter of a  close game). Saturday, he came up with three more.  </P> <P> The Wings became only the second team in history to win five in a row from the  five-time Major Indoor Soccer League champions. Baltimore beat the Sockers five  times last season.  </P> <P> Borja said he didn't feel like a hero.  </P> <P> "I stunk up the place for 55 minutes," he said. "I was really tired, and I  didn't tell the coach I was tired, and I put my team in jeopardy."  </P> <P> Borja said he kept going despite the fatigue.  </P> <P> "And thank goodness Mike Fox was there."  </P> <P> Fox got the two goals that pulled the Wings back from a 4-2 deficit. Playing  for the first time in a month after suffering a contusion on his shin, Fox  toe-poked a shot from 40 feet that beat goalkeeper Zoltan Toth at the far post.  </P> <P> Then he got the equalizer on a set play started by Borja from the restraining  arc, scoring from the right corner of the penalty area.  </P> <P> Branko Segota got the first two goals, and Crow scored just before halftime for  a 3-2 lead.  </P> <P> Then Sockers midfielder Brian Quinn, also playing his first game in a month  after recovering from an injury, scored from 30 feet on a restart pass from  Segota.  </P> <P> That made it 4-2 and put the Sockers in what seemed to be complete control.  </P> <P> "Then we decided to turn things around by forcing them to make mistakes with  full pressure," Wings defender Terry Rowe said. "We forced them to back-pedal,  got the crowd into it, and that's what won the game for us."  </P> <P> Ron Newman, the Sockers' coach, said, "They did an excellent job of putting  high pressure on us. That could have been their undoing against a team like us,  but I thought they did a good job of it."  </P> <P> Newman said the equalizing goal was assisted by the officials, who gave the  Wings a restart from the restraining arc instead at the sidelines.  </P> <P> "We should have had five goals, and that would have decided it. We had the  chances but didn't put it in at the critical time. And you knew it would turn  around and burn us."  </P> <P> But on the game-winner, Newman said, "Chico Borja, if you give him that much  room he's going to hurt you. He took a big chance staying upfield, and it  turned out right for him."  </P> <P> The Sockers had a lot of chances, but goalkeeper Ron Fearon came up with some  big saves, and defender Victor Moreland barely deflected a shot by Damir  Haramina that had Fearon beat. That would have made it 5-3.  </P> <P> "I was pleased with the way we were playing," Newman said, "but the ball never  fell in the right places for the right players."  </P> <P> Wings midfielder Tom Soehn lost control of an outlet pass by Toth and left  Segota one-on-one with Fearon. Segota made lob shot off the outside of his  right foot to get the ball over Fearon's head from the left side of the penalty  area.  </P> <P> Ben Collins made the play that got the Sockers on the scoreboard first. He beat  Fearon on the left side of the goal and fed Segota unmarked in the middle for  an easy tap-in.  </P></p>

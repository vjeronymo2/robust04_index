No. 42&hyph;00089) located in Sevier County, Utah. The petitioner proposes to establish an evaluation point to monitor the air quality where the bleeder connector connects with the North Mains return entries on a weekly basis; and to prohibit travel in the affected area. The petitioner states that due to the inability of maintaining the oxygen content at 19.5 percent in the 4th East Bleeder Connector because the air is ventilating the longwall gob area, the seals located along the bleeder connector cannot be examined safely and that to increase the air through the gob area would increase the possibility of spontaneous combustion in the gob. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 2.

Box 289, Sturgis, Kentucky 42459 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.1002 (location of trolley wires; trolley feeder wires, high-voltage cables and transformers) to its Baker Mine (I.D. No. 15&hyph;14492) located in Webster County, Kentucky. Due to the width and required production, motor horsepower will be necessary that requires the use of high-voltage for longwall equipment in the Kentucky No. 13 seam at the mine. The petitioner proposes to use high-voltage (2400 volts) operated equipment in by the last open crosscut at the working longwall sections. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 3.

The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternative method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 4.

Box 726, San Manuel, Arizona 85631 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 57.9360(a) (shelter holes) for its development contract work at Magma Copper Company's San Manuel Mine (I.D. No. 02&hyph;00151, AO&hyph;1) located in Pinal County, Arizona. The petitioner proposes to cut 34,500 lineal feet of circular shaped drift, 15 feet in diameter, using a Tunnel Boring Machine, 3440 vertical feet underground. The petitioner states that the haulage roadway is rail mounted and consists of a 36 inch gauge track, using 70 pound rail and 65 inch wide Brookville Diesel Locomotives pulling Mullenhauser side dump cars; that the shelter holes would be installed at 200 feet centers in accordance with Az. 27&hyph;345 as a new mandatory policy for the petitioner; and that the shelter holes would not be used for storage. The petitioner proposes to provide training consisting of thorough-on-site instruction by petitioner's personnel on the use of shelter holes when trains are in the drift; to conduct discussions regarding the reason this policy is being implemented; to distribute written notice of the new policy and the fact that disciplinary action may be taken when the new policy is not followed; to incorporate the new policy into petitioner's written policies and procedures manual; to provide annual refresher training and task training to new employees on the use of the platform shelters (shelter holes); and to post signs throughout the drift instructing the miners to use the platform shelters (shelter holes) when trains are moving in the drift. The petitioner states that application of the standard would result in a diminution of safety to its personnel. In addition, the petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Request for Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Persons interested in these petitions may furnish written comments.

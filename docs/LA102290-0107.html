			<p><P> October 22, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PHILIPPINE AIRLINES WILL BE TAKEN PRIVATE NEXT YEAR  </P> <P> The Philippines plans to privatize flag-carrier Philippine Airlines next year,  officials said over the weekend.  </P> <P> A company spokesman said the government wants to sell up to 35% of the carrier  to a foreign airline and 45% to employees and the public. That would leave the  government with a 20% holding.  </P> <P> The airline is now about 99% government-owned.  </P> <P> PAL is among 300 government properties that President Corazon Aquino targeted  for privatization under an ambitious program launched in 1987.  </P> <P> PAL Chairman Feliciano Belmonte said the foreign investor would be limited to a  35% interest so PAL could maintain its status as the official flag carrier.  </P> <P> The carrier's spokesman declined to say what foreign airlines PAL would  negotiate with.  </P> <P> Belmonte said the company is raising funds to buy back foreign debt of $650  million as the first step toward privatization.  </P> <P> This will be followed by the sale of equity to a foreign carrier. The final  step will be sale of equity to employees and the public through the stock  exchanges.  </P> <P> Under the plan, Belmonte said, 51% of the airline will be sold by the middle of  1991.  </P> <P> Officials announced the privatization plan at the company's annual meeting  Friday.  </P> <P> To cope with increasing passenger demand and to make itself attractive to  buyers, PAL began an expansion and modernization plan last year.  </P> <P> Officials said the company now has 14 wide-body aircraft -- seven Boeing 747s,  two DC10-30s and five A300-B4s.  </P> <P> Two more 747s will be added by February of next year.  </P> <P> The company posted a profit of $22.4 million in the fiscal year ending in  March, 1990, the highest in its 50-year history. That was 90% more than the  previous year's $11.7 million.  </P> <P> Balancing the good news about profit are alleged corruption problems at the  carrier. Two top PAL executives were suspended this summer while the company  investigates alleged fraud amounting to about $77 million.  </P></p>

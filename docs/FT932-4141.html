			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / International Company News: Enso-Gutzeit to expand in east Germany ENSO-GUTZEIT, one of Finland's largest paper makers, yesterday announced plans to build a DM800m (Dollars 493m) recycling plant in the eastern German state of Saxony, the biggest single foreign investment so far in the region. In a move aimed at expanding into the German market, and later into eastern Europe, the group will use the green-field site primarily for recycling, and will target the product for the growing newspaper market in eastern Germany. Germany already accounts for 15 per cent of the group's net sales, which last year totalled FM10.2bn (Dollars 1.86bn). The plant, situated east of Leipzig, one of the fastest-growing industrial centres among the five new eastern states, will start operating in September 1994 with an initial workforce of 300 people. Mr Jukka Hamala, director of Enso, said the decision to locate in Saxony was prompted by the region's proximity to southern Germany, the Czech Republic, and other countries in eastern Europe. 'We are in the middle of one of the fastest-growing markets in Europe,' he said, adding that the group had wanted to enter the recycling market for some time, but could not obtain enough capacity from the small Finnish market. Mr Kai Korkonen, managing director of Sachsen Papier Eilenburg, the company set up to run the plant, said it would have a production capacity of 280,000 tons a year. The government of Saxony, led by Mr Kurt Biedenkopf, had lobbied hard to attract Enso. 'Western Germany could take a leaf out of our book. Saxony is determined to attract foreign investors and make the region a highly competitive market.' Mr Biedenkopf, an economist and one of the most dynamic prime ministers in the eastern German state, also said the investment by Enso could persuade other foreign investors to settle in Saxony, and create jobs.</p>

			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Management: Now lean enterprise takes a bow Brace yourself. Like Volkswagen, Mercedes and much of western industry, your company may still be in the early stages of deciding how to introduce Japanese-style 'lean production'. It has almost certainly not got far yet with the even more demanding approach of 'business process re-engineering'. But now it faces a tougher challenge still: how to turn itself into part of a 'lean enterprise'. The challenge comes courtesy of James Womack and Dan Jones, two of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology team whose 1991 best-seller, The Machine that Changed the World, popularised the 'lean production' system pioneered by Toyota. In essence, 'lean production' eliminates unnecessary steps in the development, production and distribution of a product (or a service, for that matter). In their book, Womack and Jones showed how companies can more than halve the effort, time and expense involved - and can become much more responsive to customer demands - by making three fundamental changes: redesigning every step so that it is part of a continuous flow; recombining employees into cross-functional teams dedicated to that activity; and striving continually for improvement. The power of this approach has been evident over the past three years, as companies in Europe and North America have begun the painful process of converting to it. Only this week one of the worst laggards, Volkswagen, announced a long-overdue preliminary move: the simplification of its ridiculously complex and costly range of products and components. As VW and others are finding, 'lean production' is very ambitious. But it is also limited, in that it focuses on the redesign of individual activities within single processes, such as product development, assembly or distribution. Under the loose title of 'lean management', it has been extended to other aspects of a business. But the concept of a 'lean enterprise' is more specific, and much more far-reaching. First, it goes beyond re-engineering by embracing not just single cross-functional processes, but a cluster of them: what Womack and Jones in the latest Harvard Business Review* call 'the entire set of activities that add value to a particular family of products' (or services). They dub this 'a continuous value stream'. Second, this stream includes not just an individual company's activities, but also those of suppliers, distributors and customers. To Womack and Jones, this cross-company flow constitutes the extended 'enterprise' of the future. Each company may be part of a different extended enterprise for each of its product ranges; this distinguishes the lean enterprise concept slightly from the conventional idea of 'supplier networks' serving a whole company. Third, the 'lean enterprise' differs radically from the oversold notion of the 'virtual corporation', whose members come and go constantly. The two academics argue, rightly, that there is no way that such an unstable entity can sustain the intense, seamless collaboration needed to apply 'lean' techniques across an entire set of cross-company processes. Fourth, the lean enterprise necessitates a complete redefinition of the role of separate 'functions' (or disciplines) such as design, engineering, purchasing, marketing and accounting. Many companies are considering dumping these functions entirely, and transferring their specialist members permanently to multi-functional process teams. This may work in the short term, but Womack and Jones warn that in the long run it harms specialist skill-building; there are already signs of this at Chrysler. Instead, the duo advocates that functions should be turned into 'schools' of learning and skill-building, and sources of best practice, for the teams to draw on. Thus the traditional purchasing department, for example, should define the principles of purchasing, form links with suppliers, and work to improve their performance continuously. But its traditional role of actually purchasing supplies should be done by each product development team. Fifth, career paths must be altered, so that people can alternate more systematically between working as multi-functional team members, and periods of intense knowledge-building within their specific department. This aspect of the academics' proposal will be criticised heavily by consultants and internal company experts who have concluded that functional and team organisations do not mix, and that one or the other must be paramount in an organisation. But Womack and Jones point out that Honda, the Japanese carmaker, has used this alternating approach successfully in Japan and North America. This is not the only controversial count. The two academics will also come under fire, especially from advocates of re-engineering and 'partnership sourcing' (supply networks), for being derivative in some of their ideas, as well as too far-fetched overall. The duo's attempt to reconfigure so much of the systems which companies operate - both internally and externally - is certainly bold, and requires complex changes in organisational attitudes, structures and procedures. But, from his home base near Cardiff in Wales, Dan Jones denied this week that the lean enterprise is pie in the sky. Its various facets are drawn directly from emerging practice, in the motor industry and elsewhere, he claimed. As he says, Honda and Chrysler are not alone in implementing several parts of the concept. In Europe, Nissan and Unipart, a former offshoot of Rover, are also doing so. But none of them is having an easy ride. The changes required are far too dramatic for that. *HBR reprint no 94211. Fax (US) 617-495-6985.</p>

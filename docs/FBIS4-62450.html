			<p>BFN     [Text] On 14 May a conference on issues of settling  accounts for natural gas was held at the Ukrainian Cabinet of  Ministers under the chairmanship of Ukraine's Acting Prime  Minister Yefim Zvyahilskyy. The conference was attended by  Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Valentyn Landyk and leaders of a  number of ministries and departments.    It was pointed out at the conference that the indebtedness  of  enterprises and organizations for gas by 12 May this year  reached over 14.5 trillion karbovantsi. This is leading to the  growth of Ukraine's indebtedness to Russia's GazProm [gas  industry] and is fraught with a stoppage of the natural gas  deliveries from Russia.    The main debtors are the enterprises and organizations  subordinate to the Ministry of Power Engineering, the Ministry  of Industry, the Ministry of Machine-Building, the State  Committee for Housing and Utilities, and the Ministry of  Agriculture and Food.    In connection with this, the domestic gas and transport gas  subunits of DerzhKomNaftoHaz [state oil and gas committee] were  instructed to stop gas deliveries to the consumers should they  fail to pay for gas in advance or fail to pay out their debts in  good time. The cases against persistent defaulters will be  passed to the court of arbitration.    At the same time, the ministries and departments have to pay  off their debts in compliance with the the worked out schedules  and take measures to save energy resources.</p>

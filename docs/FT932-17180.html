			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Survey of Nigeria (15): Ambitious agenda for new team - Oil's longstanding problems are being tackled THE ENERGY sector is in need of an overhaul, and the new ministerial team led by Chief Philip Asiodu is determined to get the process under way in the short period at their disposal. Mr Asiodu, one of the leading technocrats on the transitional council, is the secretary for petroleum resources, and is highly regarded in the oil business. He has been associated with the industry for three decades, and has begun to tackle problems which, in the words of one oil man, 'have been holding back the industry for years'. Mr Asiodu and his colleagues are scheduled to hold office only until August, but he has nevertheless set an ambitious agenda. By then he aims to sign up foreign oil companies to develop new fields, get the multi-billion liquefied natural gas project off the ground after three decades of false starts, introduce sustainable domestic fuel prices, and free up the downstream and distribution sectors to foreign and private sector investment. If he achieves most of these aims, or commits the succeeding government to achieving them, 1993 will have been a turning point for the oil industry. Nigeria's budgeted oil revenue this year is Dollars 6.3bn, which is 80 per cent of the country's foreign currency earnings; but it sells fewer barrels of oil than it did in 1980, when the price was more than 50 per cent higher. Nigeria is even richer in gas than in oil, yet this resource has yet to be adequately tapped. The reasons include: inappropriate state regulation to limits on the percentage that foreign investors can hold in oil companies; downstream investment obstacles, such as loss-making domestic petroleum prices; and an inefficient local distribution system. One of these factors - the structure of the ownership of the oil industry - is putting a strain on the funding of production and exploration. Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) holds a majority stake in all the joint ventures that produce oil (which in March was just under 1.8m b/d. Yet NNPC - whose contribution to production and exploration should be proportionate to its equity stake - has said it intends to increase productive capacity from the present level of 2m b/d to 2.5m b/d by the mid-1990s, so that it can increase its Opec quota, assuming the market picks up. Nigeria's proven oil reserves are approximately 20bn barrels, but the majority of the oil fields are small and have wells producing between 500 and 5,000 b/d. Around two-thirds of Nigeria's production is onshore, mostly in the swamps of the Niger Delta, and all offshore fields are in shallow water. The next major area for exploration is in deep water concessions, as much as 4,000 feet deep. 'That is frontier territory,' says Jim Massey, Mobil's exploration and production director in Nigeria. 'Not much of the world's oil production is even at 2,000 feet deep. 'Under the production-sharing agreement, we would be purely a contractor with no equity. When we found oil we would recover our costs and then split the profits with NNPC on a sliding scale.' Mobil, like the other oil majors, stresses the importance of the Memorandum of Understanding, which in 1986 underwrote profitability for NNPC's equity partners at Dollars 2 a barrel, at a time when oil prices were very low. The agreement was amended to allow Dollars 2.5 a barrel, subject to sufficient investment, but provides no scope for extra reward based on high efficiency when the oil price is more buoyant. The draft production-sharing contract does provide such incentives, but forces the international oil companies to bear all the risk. Ashland of the US already has such a contract, but since 1991 a number of big oil companies have been negotiating for rewards to justify the cost of working in deep water. Among those interested in deep-water blocks is BP, in partnership with Statoil, ending an 11-year absence following nationalisation of its assets. Questioned about production sharing, Mr Asiodu replied: 'Once you have reached a taxation regime of over 80 per cent, the theoretical ownership of 60 per cent of the equity, as opposed to having a contractor working for you, brings minimal extra benefit', he said prior to issuing a third draft of the terms. 'So exploration sharing is better for us because we can save what little money we have for more pressing needs.' Among pressing needs is the improvement of efficiency in the downstream sector. Although NNPC has four domestic refineries with an installed capacity of over 400,000 b/d, one has been out of action since it caught fire in 1989, and the sector is running at about 50 per cent of capacity. Mismanagement and lack of funding due to very low domestic fuel prices have led to a crumbling distribution system and petrol shortages. Corruption and smuggling into neighbouring Benin, Niger, Chad and Cameroon, where domestic fuel prices are about ten and 20 times higher, has exacerbated the problem. The Transitional Council believes the solution lies in lifting the fuel price subsidies. On March 15, it reduced subsidies on non-conventionals - that is base oils, lubricant oils, paraffin wax and aviation fuel. These measures, and a three-month campaign explaining to the public the arguments against the fuel price subsidy, are in preparation for the raising of the price of petrol and diesel, with the inevitable inflationary effect and the threat of riots in response. Privatisation of downstream assets is unlikely to bring the same enthusiasm from the big oil companies as the sale of NNPC's upstream equity, but if fuel prices are raised substantially, the way could be open for new investment to transform the marketing and distribution of petroleum products. Publication of guidelines and incentives for investment in gas-related and petrochemicals products is imminent. The government is forced to meet the rising cost of the Eleme petrochemicals plant, which plans to start exporting polyethylene and polypropylene early in 1994. At the same time, it has to fund Nafcon 2, the next fertiliser plant, the LNG project, and the gas-gathering venture with Chevron to produce Liquefied Petroleum Gas at Escravos.</p>

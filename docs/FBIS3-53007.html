			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Magdi Allam: "The Thriller Story of the Abducted </F> Leader"    [Text] Cairo -- "My husband, Mansur al-Kikhya, succeeded  two months ago in uniting all the Libyan opposition forces  during a meeting in Algeria, the first time this happened on a  serious political and strategic platform. On this occasion a  second meeting between the opposition forces was scheduled in  order to take a further step forward in their common action.  This is probably why al-Qadhdhafi had him abducted." And why  Mrs. Baha al-Amry, wife of Tripoli's former foreign minister and  leader of the "Libyan Patriotic Alliance," who disappeared in  Cairo on 10 December last, made this revelation.    Al-Qadhdhafi was probably not wanting so much to hit  al-Kikhya, with whom he had been in dialogue at a distance for  some time, nor the opposition forces as a whole, who have never  constituted a serious threat to his power, rather he was  probably aiming to give a serious warning to Algeria not to get  involved in Libya's domestic affairs. On its side, Algeria has  taken the initiative in unifying the Libyan opposition in  reaction to al-Qadhdhafi's support for the Algerian  fundamentalists of the outlawed "Islamic Salvation Front." In  short, al-Kikhya's abduction should be seen as part of the  settlement of accounts between Libya and Algeria in what is a  pretty critical phase for both regimes in power. It is  significant that al-Kikhya, aged 63 and holder of an Algerian  diplomatic passport, had obtained political asylum in France and  had asked to be granted American citizenship as his wife, of  Syrian origin, is a U.S. citizen. And now Mrs. al-Amry has  written to President Clinton requesting that her husband be  granted U.S. citizenship, in the hope that the seriousness and  risks of a direct encounter with Washington will induce  al-Qadhdhafi to take a softer approach. "Al-Qadhdhafi is  behaving like someone who is desperate, he has been squeezed by  sanctions, driven into a corner by the international community,  and is reacting in an irrational manner, shouting as loud as he  can to make himself heard, " Mrs. al-Amry commented.    "It is true that there are no concrete proof that my husband  has been abducted by al-Qadhdhafi," she said, with one eye on  the masters of the house who are interested in maintaining a low  profile on the matter so as not to jeopardize the jobs of one  million Egyptian emigrants in Libya. But she added that  al-Qadhdhafi's thesis that her husband's disappearance was due  to "a settlement of accounts between two opposition groups" was  improbable. "The opposition is not involved," Mrs. al-Amry cut  us short, in particular as "after al-Kikhya's disappearance they  are now all united as he would have wished."    The other strange aspect of this intricate thriller story on  the Nile relates to the personal relationships between al-Kikhya  and al-Qadhdhafi. "My husband was in favor of dialogue with  everyone, even with al-Qadhdhafi's emissaries," Mrs. al-Amry  said, not hiding her own disapproval. "He placed conditions  only on the repeated request to return and live in Libya." In  particular al-Kikhya, in meetings in Paris with Ahmad Gheddaf  Eddaru, al-Qadhdhafi's cousin and head of the civil service, and  with others of the Libyan leader's emissaries, had placed four  conditions: recognition of the opposition forces, their  involvement in the management of power, the liberation of  political detainees, and the introduction of a democratic  system. "Obviously al-Qadhdhafi's reply was negative," Mrs.  al-Amry maintained. "He cannot live with democracy."    The proofs of al-Qadhdhafi's responsibility in this  abduction  are listed in a communique circulated in Cairo by the "Libyan  Patriotic Alliance," led by al-Kikhya. First of all it reminds  readers, and in particular the Egyptian authorities who are  accused of not carrying out an adequate investigation, that a  Libyan agent, whose mediation al-Kikhya had refused for  contacting members of the regime, also disappeared from Cairo on  10 December and reappeared two days later at Benghazi's Tibesti  hotel. Moreover, on 11 December, at 1130, three automobiles  with Libyan diplomatic plates crossed the Al-Salum frontier post  heading for Tobruk, without being subjected to any inspection.  There is a strong suspicion that one of these automobiles  contained al-Kikhya.    Will he now come to the same end as Imam Moussa Al Sadr, the  Lebanese Shiite religious dignitary, who disappeared  mysteriously in Libya in August 1980? Then al-Qadhdhafi tried  to unload the blame onto Italy, sending a look-alike of the imam  to Rome who then disappeared without trace. "I will not give  anyone any respite until I have my husband back," his wife  assured us.</p>

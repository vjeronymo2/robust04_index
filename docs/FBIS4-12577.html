			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Baghdad, 8 Apr (INA) -- 'Abd-al-Ghani  'Abd-al-Ghafur, member of the Iraq Command of the Arab Socialist  Ba'th Party, has returned to Baghdad after a visit of several  days to Moscow, where he held talks with Russian Government  officials and party leaders.    In an arrival statement to the Iraqi News Agency,  'Abd-al-Ghafur said Russian party chiefs are impressed by the  pace of Iraq's renewal, led by President Saddam Husayn, who has  turned into a symbol of the fight against imperialist hegemony.    'Abd-al-Ghafur said he hoped that when the UN Security  Council next reviews Iraq's compliance with Paragraph 22 of  Resolution 687 calling for lifting the sanctions, Russia will  adopt an even more postitive attitude. Iraq, he noted, had  fulfilled the obligations stipulated by the council resolutions,  unfair as they are.    Russian Government officials and party leaders emphasized  that retention of the sanctions hurts not only the Iraqi people  but Russia as well. They reiterated Russia's willingness to  maintain excellent relations with Iraq, 'Abd-al-Ghafur added.  [passage omitted]</p>

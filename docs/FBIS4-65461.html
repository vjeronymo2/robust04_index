			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Klaus C. Engelen: "The Balladur Government Is </F> Resolutely Reducing the Influence of the State"]    [Text] Paris, 14-15 May -- In an interview with  HANDELSBLATT, French Economics and Finance Minister Edmond G.  Alphandery said that at the next G-7 summit in Naples in several  weeks, Russia, being the "greatest challenge of our time," will  be the dominant topic. In his view, the medium-term strategy to  restore stable economic growth that Germany and France have  jointly pursued since the monetary crisis of August last year,  has been successful.    He said the new joint course between Bonn and Paris, which  is  aimed at stability and growth, has increasingly proved to be an  important cyclical pillar for Europe and the world. His  counterpart, Theo Waigel, is seeking a real growth for Germany  of 1.5 percent. The French Government is expecting a real  growth rate of 1.4 percent in 1994. These are "the stages of a  German-French conversion program that are strictly being  observed." The program -- with budget consolidation as its core  -- was jointly presented and defended in Paris on 3 August last  year, and was subsequently also expounded before the Council of  Economic and Finance Ministers in Brussels.  <H5>  Colbert Has Been Dead for Many Years </H5>   When the Balladur government took over government  responsibility in April 1993, "the French economy was in the  most serious postwar recession, with a reduction in overall  economic output of 1.2 percent in real terms in the preceding  six months and short-term interest rates of almost 11 percent in  nominal terms and 8 percent in real terms," says Alphandery.    The recovery in the German economy will also help France  achieve the much higher growth rate of 2.7 percent in real terms  fixed for 1995. According to Alphandery, economic recovery in  France is attributable to various factors. In the second half  of last year, exports improved by 4 percent. This year,  industrial investment has increased between 3 and 4 percent,  whereas in 1993, it decreased 15 percent. From July 1993 to  January 1994, construction increased 40 percent. This year,  between 30 and 40 percent more cars have so far been sold than  last year. Short-term interest rates, which are less than 6  percent, have reached the lowest level in 20 years. Since the  monetary crisis in the summer of 1993, the business barometer of  French entrepreneurs has increased by 70 points.    The image of French industry and banks being dominated by  the  state -- an image that still prevails in Germany and the  Anglo-Saxon countries -- must be drastically revised. The  economics and finance minister, who is assessed as a liberal and  conservative politician, stresses that "Colbert has been dead in  France for a very, very long time."    First, a look at the privatization that the Balladur  government has carried out is sufficient to put the facts right.  In the past six months, the government implemented  privatization projects totalling 100 billion French francs  (almost 30 billion German marks). In view of the widely  ramified holdings -- meaning secondary and tertiary  privatization effects of former state-run concerns -- which are  included in privatization, the state's influence at various  levels of the French economic sector has been reduced. "Judging  by the vehement criticism voiced by the Socialists, they have  realized how successfully we have set the course in the  direction of privatization."    Second, the high capital influx to France indicates the  country's continuous attractiveness for foreign investors. This  could hardly be compatible "with a strangulating governmental  influence." In 1992, Great Britain and France shared the top  place among Western industrial nations.    Third, analysts would be surprised if they compared the  assets controlled by foreigners -- as measured by GNP. Neither  Germany nor the United States, and even less so Japan, "could  cite as high a share held by foreigners as France, which is open  and must remain open."    As in many other areas of international and European  policy, "France and Germany are pulling together on the great  task of supporting Russia in transition to democracy and the  market economy." According to Alphandery, this is of crucial  importance in the G7 and on the European stage. However, the  French minister left it open whether the formal step to the  "G-8" -- including Russia as another member in the club of the  economically powerful countries -- could already be made at the  summit in Naples. At the Naples summit, the heads of state and  heads of government would also discuss in detail the labor  market problems in the Western industrialized states, on the  basis of the recommendations given at the Detroit employment  summit. In this respect, Alphandery is amazingly optimistic:  "Just as France must do more to overcome high youth  unemployment, Germany continues to be confronted with the  serious structural problems on the labor market in the new  laender. I am optimistic that France and Germany will jointly  master their specific structural weaknesses in the next few  years through higher economic growth and a certain amount of  flexibility and innovation."  <H5>  Bundesbank and Bonn Offended </H5>   Alphandery, who has been in office for about a year, had a  really unfortunate start, in particular in the relationship with  Germany. By making awkward remarks on "planned steps to lower  interest rates, that were coordinated with the Bundesbank,"  Balladur's new man for the Finance Ministry provoked sharp  protests from the Bundesbank and his Bonn counterpart, Theo  Waigel, and the unusual cancellation of a German-French meeting.  After that, Alphandery made himself suspicious because he "had  not been invited" to take part in crucial talks held by Waigel  and Balladur at a critical stage during the European monetary  turmoil early in August last year. Asked about his "wrong  start," Alphandery reacts calmly: "I think there are many  misunderstandings that I am eventually planning to clarify in a  book. What is important, however, is that this period is over.  We, Waigel and I, with the support of Larosiere (the former  president of the Banque de France) and Trichet (chief of the  Treasury), did a very good job in August. We made the right  decision by widening the bands in the European Monetary System.  I coordinated the measure closely with Balladur. We had a long  talk in the Matignon on Sunday morning. Subsequently, we had  difficult negotiations in the afternoon and evening."</p>

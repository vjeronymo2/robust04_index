RCRA section 4005(c)(1)(C) requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to determine whether States have adequate permit programs for MSWLFs. EPA believes that adequate authority exists under RCRA to allow Tribes to seek an adequacy determination for purposes of sections 4005 and 4010.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under separate authority of the Clean Air Act, EPA is reviewing an application for a non-attainment area permit to construct a proposed MSWLF on the Campo Reservation. There will be a separate public comment period and decision on that application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Campo Band of Mission Indians (``Campo Band'') applied for a determination of adequacy under section 4005 of RCRA. EPA reviewed the Campo Band's MSWLF application and has made a tentative determination of adequacy for those portions of the Campo Band's MSWLF permit program that are adequate to assure compliance with the revised MSWLF Criteria. These portions are described later in this notice. The Campo Band has drafted revisions to the remainder of its permit program to assure complete compliance with the revised MSWLF Criteria and gain full approval. EPA has determined that the Campo Band's revised requirements and emergency regulations, if fully adopted and affirmed before EPA makes a final determination, would be adequate to ensure compliance with the Federal Criteria. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although RCRA does not require EPA to hold a public hearing on any determination to approve a Tribe's MSWLF program, the Region has scheduled a public hearing on this tentative determination. Details appear below in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> DATES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  section. The Campo Band's application for program adequacy determination is available for public review and comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  All comments on the Campo Band's application for a determination of adequacy must be received by the close of business on July 14, 1994.

Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=2 --> 1. Solid Waste Permit Program Criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> On October 9, 1991, EPA promulgated revised Criteria for MSWLFs (40 CFR part 258). Subtitle D of RCRA, as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), 42 U.S.C. 6941&hyph;6949(a), requires States (and, as discussed below, allows Indian Tribes) to develop permitting programs to ensure that MSWLFs comply with the Federal Criteria under part 258. Subtitle D also requires in section 4005 that EPA determine the adequacy of State municipal solid waste landfill permit programs to ensure that facilities comply with the revised Federal Criteria. To fulfill this requirement, EPA has drafted and is in the process of proposing a State/Tribal Implementation Rule (STIR) that will provide procedures by which EPA will approve, or partially approve, State/Tribal landfill permit programs. The Agency intends to approve adequate State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs as applications are submitted. Thus, these approvals are not dependent on final promulgation of the STIR. Prior to promulgation of STIR, adequacy determinations will be made based on the statutory authorities and requirements. In addition, States/Tribes may use the draft STIR as an aid in interpreting these requirements. EPA notes that regardless of the approval status of a State/Tribe and the permit status of any facility, the federal landfill criteria will apply to all permitted and unpermitted MSWLF facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

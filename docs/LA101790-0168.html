			<p><P> October 17, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> COSBY DROPS CHILDREN'S MURAL FROM SHOW IN FLAP OVER CREDIT  </P> <P> Bill Cosby has dropped a colorful mural shown during the opening credits of  "The Cosby Show" in a dispute with a teacher whose Harlem students inspired the  artwork.  </P> <P> The dispute involves a mural painted on a Harlem building by students at the  Creative Arts Workshop for Homeless Children, and a similar painting shown on  the top-rated NBC series.  </P> <P> The workshop's director, Brookie Maxwell, said the children who painted the  original, "Street of Dreams," should get credit on the TV show and be paid if  the idea is marketed.  </P> <P> "I've ordered it taken off the show. It has nothing to do with the kids. Has to  do with this woman, who is trying to hold us up," Cosby said Tuesday.  </P> <P> "It's the principle of the thing," said Cosby, the highest-paid entertainer in  the world.  </P> <P> NBC spokeswoman Rosemary O'Brien said three weeks of negotiations between the  workshop and the show's producer, Carsey-Werner Co., had failed.  </P> <P> "All we wanted was credit for the children," said Vivian Pollack, a lawyer for  the workshop. "At no time did we make any specific financial demands, nor until  last night did Cosby or Carsey-Werner offer any financial settlement."  </P></p>

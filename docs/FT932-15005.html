			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Sentiment varies as Swiss exporters decline MOODS varied among bourses yesterday, as strategists continued to look for a new theme after the strong European performance in the first quarter, writes Our Markets Staff. ZURICH was led lower by exporters in response to the weak dollar. The SMI index shed 16.10 to 2,165.7 with the fall limited by a firm financial sector, still hoping for lower interest rates. 'The decline does seem to be rather an over-reaction to the weaker dollar,' said Miss Felicity Smith at Hoare Govett in London. 'But trading volume was fairly low, which may indicate that prices were being marked down by local traders rather than as a result of institutional selling.' Among exporters, Ciba-Geigy bearers, SFr10 lower at SFr637, were actively traded. Analysts suggested that the fall had more to do with currency considerations than the group's announcement of a 4 per cent fall in first quarter sales. Sandoz, the chemical and pharmaceutical group, shed SFr40 to SFr2,910, the uncertain outlook for US sales continuing to weigh on the shares. Nestle, still suffering from US doubts about the value of brands, saw its bearers fall SFr20 to SFr1,145. PARIS took time off after Tuesday's strong performance, although leading banks shaved 25 basis points off base rates following an easing in the repo rate. The CAC-40 index eased 2.65 to 2,015.43 in turnover of FFr2.06bn. There were mixed feelings in the financial sector, with Paribas gaining FFr1.40 to FFr426.20 and Societe Generale losing FFr4 to FFr640. Lyonnaise Dumez lost FFr2.00 to FFr486.70 after reporting lower 1992 profits and plans for a capital increase for its construction division later this year. FRANKFURT saw its post-holiday torpor evaporate a little around the construction sector, although the statements which provoked this were a few days old. Turnover fell from DM4.7bn to DM4bn as the DAX index rose 1.39 to 1,672.44. Mr Michael Geiger at NatWest Securities pointed to a positive statement on housing development from Germany's construction minister. Meanwhile, Philipp Holzmann, up DM17 to DM1,074, was also lifted by a good interim report; and a leak that forthcoming results will be better than expected left Heidelberger Zement DM35 higher at DM1,090. AMSTERDAM witnessed another startling performance from Begemann, the industrial conglomerate, which put on nearly 20 per cent to close Fl 8.50 higher at Fl 51.50. Analysts could cite no particular reason for the rise, although some short covering was noted. The CBS Tendency index gained 0.6 to 109.2. MILAN marked time in largely technical trade ahead of the end of the account on Friday and as options contracts expired yesterday. The Comit index dipped 0.70 to 512.31 as volume declined ahead of this weekend's political reform referendum. Fiat, planning temporary lay-offs next month in response to sluggish sales, fell L59 to fix at L6,261 before L6,270 after hours. Among privatisation candidates, banks were easier but Sme, the foods group, picked up L156 to L6,130 as employees, protesting against the sell-off, ended their occupation of the group's headquarters allowing managers to collect together the information necessary for the auction. Mondadori, Italy's largest publisher, rose L100 to L10,900 after reports that Mr Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest is considering the merger and flotation of its main publishing activities. VIENNA lost 1.2 per cent with the ATX index closing down 9.33 at 779.86. COPENHAGEN was encouraged by hopes of a cut in the domestic repo rate and the KFX index gained 1.40 or 1.8 per cent to 83.51. Unidanmark led the risers with a rise of DKr12 or 8.3 per cent to DKr157. DUBLIN continued its upward career with the ISEQ overall index rising another 21.15 to 1,572.51.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- April 14                                            THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                Open       10.30       11.00      12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100        1158.97     1159.22     1160.35    1160.35 FT-SE Eurotrack 100        1160.33     1160.83     1159.90    1160.63  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes               13.00       14.00       15.00      Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 200        1223.09     1220.94     1222.77    1226.41 FT-SE Eurotrack 200        1224.13     1224.36     1224.07    1223.50  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Apr 13     Apr 8     Apr 7     Apr 6     Apr 5  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1157.54   1151.40   1144.36   1147.43   1136.15 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1220.72   1211.28   1206.25   1210.05   1202.24  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1161.37; 200 - 1226.41 Low/day: 100 - 1158.46 200 - 1220.89.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TRIAL OF FORMER OWNERS NEARING CLIMAX;  </P> <P> RAMONA ALWAYS A FRAUD TARGET, JURY TOLD  </P> <P> In the first criminal trial involving owners of a failed Southern California  thrift, the prosecution told jurors Wednesday that the former top officials of  Ramona Savings &amp; Loan in Orange were engaged in deception and fraud "right  from the get-go."  </P> <P> "This was a federally insured savings and loan institution. We are not talking  about some piggy bank or some toy," Assistant U.S. Atty. Steven E. Zipperstein  said during closing arguments in the 11-week-old trial in U.S. District Court  in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Ramona collapsed in September, 1986, and subsequently required a $65.5-million  federal bailout of depositors.  </P> <P> John L. Molinaro and Donald P. Mangano Sr. each face more than 30 charges,  including bank fraud and conspiracy, in connection with a Palm Springs real  estate deal that prosecutors allege led to the thrift's collapse.  </P> <P> Mangano's attorney, Robert S. Horwitz, began his closing arguments by  questioning the veracity of some of the people who testified for the  prosecution.  </P> <P> "We believe a number of key government witnesses did not keep that promise to  you (the jury) to tell the truth," Horwitz said.  </P> <P> He pointed out what he said were numerous inconsistencies in testimony,  including talk about Mangano's profit from the real estate deal. Horwitz  labeled some of the testimony "so much rubbish."  </P> <P> Mangano, a real estate developer, and Molinaro, a former carpet salesman,  bought Ramona in April, 1984, and spent about $25 million, or a quarter of the  thrift's assets, building Cherokee Village condominiums.  </P> <P> The project, which the government alleges was designed to enrich the two men  rather than Ramona, was a failure. Only seven of Cherokee Village's 180 units  had been sold by the summer of 1985.  </P> <P> Zipperstein said Wednesday that Molinaro and Mangano dreamed up a complicated  scheme to sell Ramona before the thrift became insolvent and Cherokee Village  went bankrupt.  </P> <P> The two men set up four dummy corporations. Ramona then recorded a sale of the  Cherokee Village resort to three of those corporations for a $30,000 paper  profit per residential unit. Mangano then had the stock in those corporations  transferred to him.  </P> <P> The government said the sale was done to make Ramona, which recorded a  $4-million profit on the deal, look healthier to a potential buyer and to  forestall a takeover by regulators. Molinaro took a $2-million dividend from  Ramona around the same time.  </P> <P> Once the two men found a buyer, they allegedly transferred the liability of  Cherokee Village back to Ramona disguised as a land acquisition of 23 acres in  Palm Springs. No mention was made of Cherokee Village.  </P> <P> But the defense said the government's allegations were unfounded. Horwitz said  the dummy corporations were set up for tax reasons and because Mangano wanted  to protect his credit worthiness in the event Cherokee Village failed.  </P> <P> Horwitz said plenty of people knew about the transaction, including one of the  thrift's attorneys and an insurance representative. He said the $30,000 profit  that was booked per unit was done without Mangano's authorization and was an  accounting error.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Partners' Net Worth  </P> <P> The defense added that each man had a net worth sufficient to cover debts  associated with Ramona. Molinaro had a net worth of $11.8 million at the time  of Ramona's collapse; Mangano $5 million.  </P> <P> If convicted, Molinaro -- sole owner and operator of Ramona at the time of its  collapse -- faces a maximum prison sentence of 165 years and $8.3 million in  fines; Mangano could receive a 155-year setence and $7.8 million in fines.  </P> <P> The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. has filed a civil lawsuit seeking  more than $65 million in damages from Molinaro and Mangano, alleging that the  two men began pilfering from the thrift almost as soon as they bought it. The  civil case is not expected to go to court until at least December.  </P> <P> The current proceedings are scheduled to continue today with closing arguments  by Molinaro's attorney.  </P></p>

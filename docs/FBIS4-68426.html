			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Georgian Acting General Procurator Dzhamlet </F> Babilashvili by SAKARTVELOS RESPUBLIKA Correspondent Davit  Bitsadze: "Law and Order Is Not an End in Itself..."; place and  date not given]    [Text] He was born in Sagaredzho in 1942, the son of  a jurist. He graduated with honors from Tbilisi State University  in 1969 and went to graduate school. He is a candidate of  juridical sciences. For a number of years he worked in the  Georgian Academy of Sciences Economics and Law Institute, first  as a junior and later as a senior researcher. He has published a  number of scientific works. He has served in agencies of the  Procuracy since 1977: he was Procurator of Sagaredzhoyskiy  Rayon, First Deputy Transport Procurator of Transcaucasia,  Deputy Chief and Department Chief of the Procuracy Investigative  Administration of the Republic of Georgia, and Procurator of  Kutaisi. In 1991-1992 he served as a judge on the Georgian  Supreme Court, and was a member of the Presidium of that Court.  In December 1992 he was appointed a Deputy General Procurator of  the Republic of Georgia. He is now Acting General  Procurator.    He is married and has three children.    [Bitsadze] Batono Dzhamlet, what is the Procuracy like  today,  and what problems does it face?    [Babilashvili] The transition period to Georgian statehood  has also left its mark on the Procuracy. The old style and  methods of the Procuracy have nearly been changed, but the new  style and methods are not yet fully in place. In short, the  Procuracy is a transition-stage state agency which is finding  its place in the new system of state agencies. It will continue  to function as the chief agency overseeing compliance with  legality; its job is to see that the law is uniformly and fully  complied with both by individual citizens and by officials and  departments. The Procuracy has an investigative apparatus that  is not very large but is very mobile and highly qualified to  make its contribution to the fight against crime.    As for problems, we have plenty of them. People are tired of  lawlessness and are waiting for the government to help. Still,  crime is the most pressing problem. It is along this line that  Procuracy organs, in my opinion, need to focus all their  professionalism and efforts. It's true that it is the Internal  Affairs and Security agencies that are on the front line of the  battle, but the Procuracy can and must make its own hefty  contribution. This is proved by the hundreds of difficult crime  cases by which our investigative officers have caught and  instituted criminal proceedings against many dangerous criminals  such as murderers, terrorists, gangsters, and other violent  felons. The Procuracy's evidence is used to jail dangerous  criminals; in the courts my colleagues defend the state's  interests in the battle against crime, monitor the lawful  punishment of perpetrators, exercise oversight of convicts'  serving of time in places of incarceration and of the lawfulness  of investigation procedures in the Security and Internal Affairs  agencies, and so on. We regularly analyze the crime situation in  the Center and the outlying areas and draw up expert  recommendations.    [Bitsadze] Laws enforced now were passed by the totalitarian  regime. Doesn't this make your work harder? Could that be why  the fight against crime has not been effective?    [Babilashvili] Completely new legal relations are now  becoming established in our life, and naturally they will  require the appropriate legislative adjustments.    However, because we are talking about crime we have to say  that, in my opinion, a number of fundamental peculiarities are  to be noted in this regard in the legislation that is in force:  in some cases, a particular norm is clearly obsolete, an  anachronism (for example, economic crimes); in other cases,  however, many such norms are correct and in keeping with the  times, but the necessary conditions for enforcing these laws are  not yet in place.    Certainly, everything must be rectified in the course of  time. The implementation of normal legislation, naturally, will  improve the law enforcement agencies' effectiveness in keeping  order. Future legislation work will have to take account of the  realities of our life, the level of legal consciousness of the  republic's citizens whom the norms are intended for, our  national character, and other particular factors....    There are other factors. In present legislation, for  example,  for some reason a situation has taken shape in which the law  protects the criminal rather than the victim, against the  interests of the injured party. It should be the opposite.    Especially today, when the victim of a crime is virtually  terrorized, under great pressure from the criminal or his  associates, and there is no mechanism in the laws to protect him  from it. The same thing is true of a witness to a crime. It is  this factor that is one important reason why a substantial  number of cases are not solved, or if they are they never come  to court because the victims or witnesses recant their initial  testimony. This is understandable, because the people are afraid  of the criminals and the state is not protecting them. I think  immediate legislative measures must be taken to rectify that  situation.    [Bitsadze] In your opinion, what are some of the features of  crime today? What changes have there been?    [Babilashvili] Clearly, crime has become more organized.  Organized gangs have come into being, crime has become their way  of life. They have support in the state structures, they are  economically very strong and have the right connections; they  control certain territories and certain types of business and  trade. Many such gangs are now legalized, and some of them have  acquired status and, as is the fashion these days, they have  infiltrated certain official structures (the law enforcement  agencies have detailed information on them). The public is aware  that the process of isolating them is underway, and hopefully we  will finish the job.    Another peculiarity is that most registered crimes are of  the  violent category--murder, robbery, banditry.    I mentioned murder. There has probably never been such an  increase in the number of murders in the history of Georgian  crime. Sometimes there are as many as 10 murders a day in  Georgia, and motiveless murders are also on the rise.    The criminal world has never been so well armed as today.  You  can find all kinds of firearms in the hands of criminals, to say  nothing of communications devices, night vision devices, and so  on. Most important, criminals can acquire firearms easily,  securely, and without hesitation. Naturally, all of this makes  it harder to fight crime and requires the use of additional  detection, technical, and legal forms and methods.    [Bitsadze] Batono Dzhamlet, what do you think of the death  penalty, also lynch law?    [Babilashvili] I am personally against the death penalty,  but  as a jurist and a procurator I denounce the savagery of the  criminal world, whose criminal actions are characterized by  unprecedented violence, cynicism, and arrogance. I think that  society has to do something to protect itself, including the  threat of the death penalty. Naturally, this is not really a  solution to the problem, because the fight against crime, as we  know, requires much more than making punishment tougher. It  requires an integrated solution, and one element of that has to  consider the supreme penalty--the death penalty. From this  position, I believe that this extreme penalty is still necessary  in today's Georgia. Life itself testifies to this. I'm referring  to a situation that has taken shape in recent years: there is a  widespread rumor that the death penalty has been abolished, and  people have reacted with mob law, stoning criminals to death.  This is not befitting to a nation having the kind of legal  traditions we have. As a punishment, the death penalty has not  been abolished in our country. Last year, in fact, the Georgian  Parliament introduced execution by firing squad, along with  other penalties, for two new grave crimes, among amendments in  the Criminal Code (Article 65[.sup]1[/]--genocide--and  Article 66[.sup]1[/]-- for a mercenary taking part in an  armed conflict or battle). The criminal world has to realize  that society does have a tough tool to protect itself from their  depredations--the death penalty.    [Bitsadze] When the situation is real tough and all kinds of  brutal and harsh crimes are being committed, how does the  investigative apparatus work?    [Babilashvili] The republic's investigative apparatus is  working at full capacity. Investigators of the Procuracy, the  Security Ministry, and the Internal Affairs Ministry are  investigating very serious cases, some of which are of great  social resonance, including crimes by the ex-President's allies  in western Georgia, ethnic cleansing and genocide of the  Georgian population by the Abkhazian separatists, criminal  violations in the monetary-credit system, the crimes of the  Tatishvili brothers, the Sviri Brotherhood, the gangs operating  in Guria and Lower Kartlia, and others. Not to mention the  numerous cases of terrorism, murder, kidnapping, robbery, and  other grave crimes.    Unfortunately, the republic's investigative apparatus is not  yet very effective. Almost half of the grave crimes that are  committed remain unsolved, and this adversely affects one  fundamental principle of the fight against crime--namely, that  liability for committing a crime must be inexorable. When  criminals go unpunished, this encourages not only repeat  criminals but also new persons to commit crimes.    It is true that a big share of the blame for this goes to  the  investigative and detective services, but there are reserves to  be found here as well. Frequently, investigations drag on for no  good reason, the quality of the investigation is rather low, and  so on; naturally, citizens are justified in their complaints and  dissatisfaction, and the Procuracy must exert more control in  this regard. The investigative service, of course, has plenty of  problems of its own, but that is another subject.    [Bitsadze] Wouldn't one solution be to create a separate  investigative apparatus--that is, to form a unified  investigative body? The way it is today, investigations are done  separately by the Procuracy, the Internal Affairs Ministry, and  Security....    [Babilashvili] The suggestion to create a unified  investigative apparatus is not new. It was being discussed back  under the old Soviet regime, but for some reason no practical  steps were taken. In the present former Soviet republics, now,  there have been attempts to reform the investigative  apparatuses, but it looks as if the effort has stalled. I  believe that only Lithuania has a separate investigative  committee.    The basic argument of those who favor creating a separate  investigative apparatus is that the same agency ought not to  both investigate and exercise oversight (it is the Procuracy  they have in mind). This argument is probably well grounded. So  some post-communist countries--Russia, for example--have taken  the step of granting the accused the right to appeal a  procurator's authorization to jail him as well as a decree to  extend his jail term; of course, there are plenty of opponents  to this legislative innovation.    What route we will take will be revealed by court reform. Of  course, the creation of a separate investigative apparatus is no  panacea. I can name several leading foreign countries in which  there are more agencies having the right of preliminary  investigation than we have. In the U.S., for example, more than  five agencies do investigations: the FBI, the CIA, the Tax  Collection Department, the Drug Enforcement Agency, the Customs  Service, and others.    Eminent specialists believe, however, that the point is not  which department runs the investigation but how well it performs  its role in the justice system.    [Bitsadze] The public is aware that cases of the allies of  the ex-President are under investigation. Isn't there a danger  of scores being settled with political adversaries? How  effectively will the law be obeyed?    [Babilashvili] Not to be too categorical about it, I will  say  that such a precedent is ruled out. This has been stated  repeatedly by leaders of the government and the law enforcement  agencies, and it has been backed up by concrete actions. We have  reconciled hundreds of persons who have voluntarily turned in  their weapons, and criminal proceedings against them have been  stopped. These are persons who are not guilty of a grave crime.    Naturally, clemency does not extend to persons who have  inspired fratricidal civil war and national fragmentation and  are guilty of grave sins. These people include certain deputies  to the former Supreme Soviet and high officials of the former  regime, the chairman of the government and certain members of  the government, prefects, leaders of armed gangs, and so on who  are subject to imprisonment. Some of them are already in  custody, and some are being sought by the Internal Affairs and  Security ministries as being guilty of grave crimes. The charges  against them are criminal charges and have nothing to do with  political motives.    [Bitsadze] The public is aware that the republic's  enforcement ministries have been carrying out major operations  against criminal gangs; they have been searching homes on a  massive scale, jailing suspects, and so on. Isn't there a danger  of ignoring the requirements of the law?    [Babilashvili] Whenever the enforcement ministries prepare  for such operations, they have absolute information about the  criminals, about the property they have obtained illegally,  about their weapons, their narcotics stashes, wanted criminals,  and other things, but for understandable reasons these do not  require detailed discussion. As a rule, these operations are  consulted on with the Procuracy, and we check on the legality of  the plans.    The operations are participated in by the appropriate  investigative officers, who ensure compliance with the law and  the procedural aspects of detention, searches, and confiscation  of any items obtained by criminal means. In short, we have  created the necessary system to ensure the protection of  citizens' legitimate rights. In general, though, such operations  are new to our experience, necessitated by the requirements of  the time; for its part, the Procuracy spares no effort to ensure  that these encouraging efforts are made in compliance with the  law.    [Bitsadze] You mentioned court reform. How do you envision  it, and how does it tie in with the Procuracy?    [Babilashvili] A special decree of the Head of State has  created a commission relating to court reform, and I am one of  the co-chairmen of it. Court reform is essential, and it will be  carried out as soon as stability is restored in the republic,  when the executive branch has real control over processes in the  country. Agencies of the Procuracy will also have to be reformed  accordingl--but gradually, in stages. There are a number of  ideas about that, sometimes mutually exclusive ones; there are  also some fashionably extreme notions about abolishing the  Procuracy as a state agency and turning its functions over to  various other agencies. Time will tell how this matter is to be  resolved.    I get the impression that there are forces in our country  which are not pleased when such a legitimately academic and  centralized body as the Procuracy is doing its job of protecting  the state's interests. At one time these forces did everything  they could to diminish enforcement departments such as the  Security and the Internal Affairs agencies, and to some extent  they achieved that. What we got as a result is clear to everyone.    [Bitsadze] At a time when people are settling scores with  each other through the use of weapons, how realistic is it to  speak of law enforcement? Doesn't it add up to legal nihilism?    [Babilashvili] To some extent it probably is, but let's also  keep in mind that other countries on the road to freedom have  been in similar and even worse shape and have still made it out  of the crisis. It seems that a grave crime situation is the  price society pays for democracy and freedom. Whatever  difficulties we have, we must never forget the civilized form  known as legal relations among men. The state and its agencies  will have to do their part. We must strengthen citizens' faith  in the law, while those who flout the law will have to be dealt  with effectively, up to and including the use of force, and this  is being done with increasing intensity.    [Bitsadze] One of the culminating stages of the justice  system is punishment. How do things stand in Georgia in this  regard?    [Babilashvili] Things are worrisome in that regard too. The  system on which Soviet penitentiary policies were based--using  prisoners as a cheap work force, the use of corrective labor,  and so on, has been dismantled and is practically no more. The  new conception, with its appropriate institutions and material  base, is in the formation stage. Meanwhile, prisoners--or,  rather, convicts--need to be maintained and employed, and this  is one of our most serious problems right now. In fact, if the  state cannot take care of a prisoner and comply with punishment  procedures, its whole penal policy against crime will be in  doubt. If we want to establish order, we will have to scale  everything down, as they say, and take care of our prisoners in  order to ensure continuity of the cycle of instituting criminal  proceedings, court trial, and serving sentence. Otherwise these  first two stages of the justice process will become purely a  ritual, because criminal punishment will not fulfill the  function which criminal law assigns to it in the fight against  crime.    [Bitsadze] What are the prospects of the fight against  crime?  Is there any cause for optimism?    [Babilashvili] The fight against crime is a long and  difficult process. Our task now is to bring crime under control,  and our enforcement ministries really are up to that task. Once  terrorism and banditry are wiped out, the crime rate curve will  start to go down; hence, we really do have cause for optimism.  Most important, public opinion is on our side; people want us to  wipe out violence, robbery and looting and lawlessness; people  want the chance to live and work normally.    [Bitsadze] Batono Dzhamlet, there has been considerable  hullabaloo over bank credits these days. What is your position?  What is the Procuracy doing about it?    [Babilashvili] By an order of the Head of State, we are  tasked with coordinating all the work of checking the legality  of credit issuance; this work is being done by the National  Bank, the Chamber of Control, the Procuracy, and Security and  Internal Affairs agencies. This work is going on quite  intensively. Still, it is very difficult and time-consuming.  About 20 criminal cases have been brought up to requirements and  are underway. Suspects have been jailed, and investigation is  underway. The disposition is such, in general, that the basic  aim of the investigation is to recover the credits to the state,  and persons who voluntarily pay their debt will be granted  leniency according to the law. So far, billions of coupons have  been returned to the state. The effort is continuing. It is made  difficult by the fact that many of our countrymen have taken the  hard currency gained by converting money "resurrected" from the  credits (we're talking about millions) and stashed it in foreign  banks. Unless they turn it in voluntarily, the appropriate legal  steps will be taken to recover the illegally obtained monies.    [Bitsadze] There have been frequent explosions, sabotage,  and  terrorist acts, and various opinions about them have been  published. What can you say about them, and what is the  Procuracy doing?    [Babilashvili] All of these acts are state crimes according  to the Criminal Code. It is because they are particularly  dangerous that the State Security agencies are tasked with  combatting them. The Procuracy is involved with these problems  basically in terms of overseeing legality.    As to recent explosions, I know that intensive work is going  on in the Security Ministry, and results will surely be  forthcoming.    In general, along with the stepped-up assault on the world  of  crime a backlash is also quite possible, manifested in similar  actions. Consider certain other factors as well: Do you think  that in terms of safety everything has ended with the civil war?  How many frustrated people are there, filled with the desire for  revenge, because of their political bankruptcy and other base  feelings? The war situation in Abkhazia and the fact that the  republic's internal borders are unprotected make it imperative  that we be alert and watchful. Consider, also, the mafia clans'  struggle for spheres of influence. Hence, the various agencies  have plenty to worry about. Until a crime is solved and the  specific criminal is identified, therefore, it is difficult and  probably awkward to assert anything categorically.    Many worthy men have fallen in the fight against crime,  including many law enforcement officers. Sad to say, some of  their murders remain unsolved today. Consider, in particular,  the treacherous murder of the Procurator of Tbilisi; serious  efforts are underway to solve it, and the results are  encouraging. We consider solving it to be a matter of the honor  of the republic's Procuracy.    [Bitsadze] Material incentives play a big part in the  interests of Procuracy officers. How do things stand in that  regard?    [Babilashvili] Things are not very well in that regard.  Practically everything these days depends on the officers'  enthusiasm and professional dedication. Many of them couldn't  make it and have transferred to other structures, and others are  quitting now. The majority realize that almost everyone is  having trouble these days, and they're waiting patiently for a  better future.    The Procuracy needs help if we are going to be able to work  somehow. This refers to transportation, fuel, equipment and  supplies, and so on. We don't have the resources to have new  uniforms made, and all kinds of other things I won't talk about  now. All we ask is the minimum necessary to maintain the  institution and keep a qualified cadre nucleus.    [Bitsadze] Batono Dzhamlet, what you have said should  encourage readers who have suffered so much bitterness and pain  in recent years. Can you add anything?    [Babilashvili] A true Procuracy officer has always  sympathized with anyone who is a victim of lawlessness. For a  professional there is nothing more saddening and depressing than  for someone to be in trouble and nothing can be done to help him  or ease the situation because of circumstances. And, sad to say,  there are such cases in our experience. Eventually, undoubtedly,  everything will fall into place, and law and order, based on  reason, will triumph. Naturally, this is not an end in itself.  It is the means by which to open the way to constructive labor  and ensure Georgia's economic and spiritual revival. My wish for  our people is that that time will come soon.</p>

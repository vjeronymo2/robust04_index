			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOYCOTT OF 'PSYCHO' PUBLISHER DEBATED  </P> <P> I am appalled by the excerpts I've read from "American Psycho" and hope no one  reads it. However, as a bookseller and a supporter of NOW, I cannot condone a  blanket boycott of Random House.  </P> <P> Does NOW really wish to imply that all Random House's publications are tainted  by a single book? Vintage (a Random House imprint) publishes authors like  Angela Davis, Antonia Fraser, Maxine Hong Kingston and Kazuo Ishiguro.  </P> <P> Under other imprints, Random House publishes thousands of books. Should I not  sell "Babar the Elephant," "The Random House Dictionary" or John Updike's  novels? How about Margaret Drabble or A.S. Byatt?  </P> <P> Even if Random House didn't publish such an extensive and impressive list, I  could not condone a boycott. Each book is a separate work and should be judged  in its own right. I sincerely hope "American Psycho" sinks as did Ellis' last  novel. But with all this publicity, I fear more and more people will hear  about, buy and read his offensive book.  </P> <P> LISE FRIEDMAN  </P> <P> Culver City  </P></p>

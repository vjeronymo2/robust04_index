			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / EC plans tougher banking rules THE European Commission yesterday announced proposals to strengthen the powers of banking supervisory authorities in the EC in the wake of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International scandal. The proposals call for tightened supervision of all financial institutions, ranging from banks, credit institutions, and insurance businesses, to ensure that their operations are transparent - a quality which was absent in the case of BCCI, making it more difficult for the supervisory authorities to intervene. The Commission said that although the basic approach of its second banking directive, investment services directive, and third-generation insurance directive was sound, new provisions were needed to strengthen the supervisors' powers to monitor the institutions under their remit. The Commission also proposed: A new requirement whereby the financial institutions must maintain their head offices in the same member state as the registered office. A widening of the list of bodies with whom confidential supervisory information can be exchanged by the authorities. Obliging auditors to report to the authorities any irregularities which might harm customers, the financial system or the undertaking itself.</p>

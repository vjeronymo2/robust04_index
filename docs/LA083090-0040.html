"It's a dream come true being a  father. It all happened because he made it happen. I didn't think he would get  to the big leagues as fast as he did.  </P> <P> "I'm just very proud of what we've accomplished," Griffey said.  </P> <P> Ken Jr., 20, the Mariners' starting center fielder the past two seasons,  attended a news conference at the Kingdome with his father before Wednesday's  game against Detroit.  </P> <P> The father-son duo then took batting practice.  </P> <P> The younger Griffey bantered with his father but said nothing to reporters.  </P> <P> Griffey, an 18-year major leaguer, was placed on waivers Friday by the  Cincinnati Reds. He cleared waivers Wednesday, becoming a free agent.  </P></p>

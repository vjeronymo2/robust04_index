			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading Comments by the President of the Bundesbank sent bond markets into retreat and stock index futures crashing through the 3,100 support level in thin trading in the derivatives, writes Joel Kibazo. The first trade in the June contract on the FT-SE 100 futures contract was struck at 3,130, just ahead of the cash market. However, this soon changed as June faltered on sporadic selling mainly from independent traders. But trading remained very thin indeed and less than 1,000 contracts had been dealt by 9.30am and just over 2,500 lots had been traded by lunch. June was now trading at a substantial discount but it was the comments from the Bundesbank President that sent the contract falling through the 3,100 support level, as both the bond markets and Wall Street reacted to the comments. Dealers also reported increased arbitrage activity as the premium between the cash and the cash market widened. The contract closed at 3,085, a 22 point discount to cash on poor volume of 7,320. In traded options, dealers reported the least active session this year as total volume fell to 17,690 lots. The FT-SE 100 option traded 7,285 lots and the Euro FT-SE option 2,985 lots. No stock option traded more than 1,000 lots with the most active British Aerospace at 603 contracts.</p>

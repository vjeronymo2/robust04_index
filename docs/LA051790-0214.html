			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LOST YOUR WAY? BLAME IT ON THE BRAIN'S RIGHT SIDE  </P> <P> Although Suzanne lived in Kansas City for three years, she had difficulty  finding her way around town and would often get lost.  </P> <P> "I became turned around the minute I arrived there and never got straightened  out," said the 40-year-old high school teacher who now lives in Orange County.  </P> <P> Suzanne, who asked that her last name not be used, has always had difficulty  with directions.  </P> <P> "Everywhere I've lived, this has been a problem, although I've found some areas  more confusing than others."  </P> <P> All of us know people who get lost easily. We dismiss them as careless people  who don't pay attention to where they're going.  </P> <P> Our assumptions are wrong, however. People who are unable to navigate  themselves have a weakness in the right side of the brain, which is the area  that controls our sense of visual and spatial orientation, say  neuropsychologists.  </P> <P> "Topographical orientation problems are caused by a weakness in the visual  right hemisphere of the brain," said Ida Stolk, a clinical psychologist in  Tustin who specializes in neuropsychology.  </P> <P> The problem can range from mild to more severe.  </P> <P> "My bias is that everyone has a certain amount of brain dysfunction and that  accounts for individual differences," said Arnold Purisch, a clinical  psychologist who directs the Orange County Neuropsychology Group in Irvine.  "Many people have this problem in varying degrees. There are those who have  some difficulty navigating and then there are individuals who actually have  brain damage and can get lost in areas that are well known to them. Most people  have minimal problems, though."  </P> <P> Individuals who often get lost do so because they easily become spatially  disoriented.  </P> <P> "When they travel down a street in a new area, they will usually turn left when  they should turn right and vice versa," Purisch said. "They have to make sure  they write everything down when they get directions and carefully check out  maps. Diagrams also cause them problems. If they are going to put something  together, they often can't understand the diagram and will end up reading the  verbal directions until they work it out in their minds."  </P> <P> Direction sufferers never aced a geography class, either, although such people  are often very intelligent.  </P> <P> "It is frustrating," said Suzanne, who tests well in academics and languages.  "I've often asked myself: 'Why are you not able to find your way around? You're  an intelligent person. It's not that complicated.' "  </P> <P> Individuals who have this difficulty often have exceptional verbal skills,  which are regulated by the left hemisphere of the brain.  </P> <P> "The average person has average skills across the board," Purisch said. "But  when someone has exceptional verbal skills, they often have problems in the  spatial area."  </P> <P> As a result, people with orientation problems generally succeed in careers such  as psychology, languages, writing and publishing, and law.  </P> <P> "Law is a perfect example," Purisch said. "It is a purely analytical, verbal  type of profession."  </P> <P> The problem is rarely seen in people who are successful architects, engineers,  mechanics or surgeons. Individuals in such professions should be able to look  at diagrams and know where everything fits.  </P> <P> Researchers aren't sure why one area of the brain becomes weaker than the  other.  </P> <P> "An injury or brain infection may cause it at some point, but more often than  not people are born with the weakness," Stolk said.  </P> <P> "I have found that spatial problems sometimes run in families. It could be  genetic," Purisch said. "There is also the possibility that a trauma occurred  during pregnancy or birth that created biochemical abnormalities. Or there  could be subtle structural differences in the brain. But at the moment our  diagnostic technology isn't advanced enough to determine this."  </P> <P> One theory of early brain dysfunction may explain why some people have a  weakness in the right hemisphere.  </P> <P> "The brain seems to have a preference for developing verbal skills over  nonverbal ones," Purisch said. "So some of the latter skills may get crowded  out while the verbal skills develop to a greater extent. This could be what  happens to people who don't have a sense of direction."  </P> <P> Because having a mild lack of direction is not that critical in our society,  there is no prescribed method for treating individuals with the problem.  Experts do have techniques for treating people with more severe spatial  problems, however, and those can be applied.  </P> <P> "It's very difficult to improve one's inherent sense of spatial appreciation by  itself," Purisch said. "Generally individuals have to learn how to compensate  by using their left hemisphere better. They need to use prepositions when  traveling, which the left hemisphere is so good at using, such as left and  right and up and down."  </P> <P> Instead of simply noting the billboard near their destination, people with weak  right hemispheres must become verbally aware of it. They have to acknowledge  where it is in relation to where they are going. Is it to the left, right or  behind? They should read the billboard aloud and even spell words. It is  helpful if as many senses as possible are involved.  </P> <P> Carefully studying maps improves the situation.  </P> <P> "When they go somewhere they've never been before, they should look at a map,  write out the route and slowly and deliberately practice it over and over,"  Purisch said. "That makes it conscious and verbal, which is very left  hemisphere."  </P> <P> By using their left hemispheres, people may even strengthen the weak areas of  their brains, according to Stolk. Computer programs have been developed to  strengthen the brain. One program created by Psychological Software Services  Inc. in Indiana shows shapes on the screen momentarily, which then need to be  recalled by the person using the program.  </P> <P> "This helps a person develop a sense of placement and association," Stolk  explained. Another test Stolk uses consists of a set of four boards that hold  nine pegs. One peg on each board is stationary. Testers pull on all of the pegs  to determine which ones are intact and watch as the boards are placed on top of  one another. Then they try to indicate which are the stationary pegs.  Individuals with direction problems will often have difficulty with this,  especially when boards are rotated.  </P> <P> "I panicked when the boards were turned," Suzanne said. "I couldn't keep track  of where they were. Once I learned the pattern, it helped, but I still had  difficulty. It's nice to know, though, there is help for this problem," she  said. "Although it hasn't caused too much trouble, it has been irritating, and  I'm glad to know that I'm not crazy."  </P></p>

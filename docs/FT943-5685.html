			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Motor side helps Barr &amp; WAT advance 40% Pre-tax profits at Barr &amp; Wallace Arnold Trust, the motor distribution and leisure and holiday group, advanced 40 per cent from Pounds 663,000 to Pounds 928,000 in the half-year to June. The rise was achieved in spite of greater losses in leisure and holidays and on the back of a 39 per cent increase at the operating level in the motor distribution side. Here profits emerged at Pounds 1.98m (Pounds 1.42m) on divisional turnover up at Pounds 82.2m (Pounds 68.2m). Mr John Parker, chief executive since May when Mr Malcolm Barr, chairman, ceded half the dual role, said new car sales, were ahead of the market. The group took steps to develop its used cars sales operations, which, including the concomitant financing and MOT sides, outperformed the new car side. As part of plans for 'controlled expansion', the group bought in August a Mercedes dealership in Bristol for Pounds 3.66m, bringing the total to eight dealerships. Mr Parker said he was brought in to 'look at changing the culture of the company', though he stressed that Mr Barr was the only family member on the board and that the family was being proactive in the process. The group has 2.45m ordinary shares and almost 10m A non-voting. The leisure and holidays side incurred losses of Pounds 820,000 (Pounds 538,000) on turnover of Pounds 31m (Pounds 30.2m). Group turnover rose 15 per cent to Pounds 124m (Pounds 108m). Earnings were 4.8p (3.5p) and the interim dividend is held at 3p.</p>

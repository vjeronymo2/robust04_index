			<p><P> November 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'CREATION SCIENCE' -- AN ELUSIVE THEORY;  </P> <P> EVOLUTION: FUNDAMENTALIST CHRISTIANS HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET SCHOOLS TO OFFER  'COMPETING' IDEAS TO THE TEACHING OF LIFE'S ORIGINS, BUT THE ALTERNATIVE WAS  RARELY DISCUSSED OR DESCRIBED. THE CAMPAIGN SEEMS HEADED FOR FAILURE.  </P> <P> For the last year, fundamentalist Christians have waged a dogged campaign to  persuade California's public schools to offer "competing theories" to the  teaching of evolution.  </P> <P> But in all the months of arguing, "creation science" -- the alternative being  proposed -- was hardly ever discussed on its own merits or even described.  Anti-evolutionist Christians rarely provided looks into that cosmos of  mind-boggling ideas, all linked to sharply differing interpretations of the  Bible.  </P> <P> Although the strategy was carefully designed, the campaign seems headed for  failure.  </P> <P> At its meeting Wednesday and Thursday, the 11-member state Board of Education  is expected to approve new guidelines for science teachers (and ultimately  textbook publishers) that would strengthen earlier vague wording and treat  evolution as a factual basis for the development of life on Earth.  </P> <P> During a public hearing on the evolution issue in Sacramento last month, board  President Francis Laufenberg told an emotional audience that many of the  anti-evolution arguments were useless. He cited a 1987 U.S. Supreme Court  ruling that struck down a Louisiana law which had required the teaching of  evolution to be accompanied by instruction in creationism.  </P> <P> Even with Laufenberg's warning, ultraconservative Christians are still hopeful,  however, that wording of the new guidelines will give them an entree into the  schoolroom.  </P> <P> "I believe the board will support the right of the teacher to bring up  competing theories voluntarily," said the Rev. Lou Sheldon, chairman of the  Traditional Values Coalition, who contended that the Louisiana ruling allows  that possibility.  </P> <P> An examination of the debate shows why neither side has wanted to talk about  creationism.  </P> <P> On one side, scientists, educators, mainline clergy and civil libertarians  summarily dismiss creationism as religious speculation inappropriate for  science classes.  </P> <P> "Creationism should not be offered in biology classes for the same reason that  we don't want children taught that the Earth is flat or that spirits cause  measles," declared a brochure of the National Center for Science Education in  Berkeley.  </P> <P> On the other side, fundamentalist leaders advised letter-writers not to ask  that creationism be given equal time with evolution but instead to focus on  alleged "flaws" in evolution theory. Scientific elites were accused of  ridiculing beliefs and hampering freedom of inquiry.  </P> <P> "Creation is the basis of all real science, of true Americanism . . . and of  true Christianity," wrote leading creationist Henry M. Morris. His Institute  for Creation Research in Santee says the Earth is only a "few thousand" years  old. "Evolutionism, on the other hand, can be shown to be only a pseudoscience  masquerading as a science," Morris added.  </P> <P> Accusations also fly between conservative Christians. Those who disagree with  fundamentalist scenarios of earthly origins are said to be deviating from  biblical faith.  </P> <P> "We're not saying what kind of creationism we want taught," Sheldon said in an  interview. While he said he personally supports the "young Earth" scenario  promoted by the Institute for Creation Research, he added "I know that a lot of  churches don't understand all the (variations). I don't want to get caught in  the flak."  </P> <P> Among the variety of theories within creationism is the "young Earth" scenario,  in which the universe, Earth and its life forms were abruptly created in less  than a week 6,000 to 10,000 years ago. Fossils and geological layers, which  conventional science sees as evidence of Earth's age in millions of years, is  in reality the catastrophic result of a worldwide flood that would have killed  most species were it not for the pairs of living things preserved by Noah in  his ark, according to the theory.  </P> <P> Advocates of the "gap" theory, that the Earth is indeed millions of years old,  claim that there was an enormous gap of time before God began creating life on  Earth. The time-gap theory was based on a translation of the first two verses  of Genesis that biblical scholars now say was erroneous.  </P> <P> In a "geocentrist" theory of creation, the Earth is the center of the universe  -- as surmised from Bible verses. One argument advanced is that there is no  preferred point in the universe by which motion can be judged absolutely.  </P> <P> In "theistic evolution," the general framework of evolution theory is accepted  but still requires a Creator. Most proponents regard the "days" of creation as  long periods of time, but many also insist that science fails to show how life  could have advanced to higher stages at crucial junctures without divine  intervention.  </P> <P> "Advocates of each position insist that they, and they alone, interpret the  Bible according to proper . . . principles. Each accuses those on their left of  denying some aspect of God's revealed truth," said Tom McIver, whose  dissertation on anti-evolutionist ideology was recently accepted by UCLA's  anthropology department. Likewise, the strictest fundamentalists are charged  with being unscientific, he said.  </P> <P> The leading evangelical magazine, Christianity Today, concluded a year ago that  although a "unified evangelical position" on evolution and creation would be  "desirable, even urgent, (the solution) seems particularly elusive."  </P> <P> Falling outside those church circles are countless numbers of Protestants,  Catholics and Jews who say evolutionary theory explains the "how" of earthly  life while Scripture suggests the "why" of existence.  </P> <P> The Jewish Federation Council of Greater Los Angeles reiterated its opposition  to "any attempt to interject religion and religious precepts" into California's  science guidelines. The council said that not only would it violate  church-state separation principles by favoring a particular religious tenet but  also would harm the state's efforts to "combat the alarming trend toward  scientific illiteracy among our students."  </P> <P> Many conservative evangelical leaders are unsympathetic as well.  </P> <P> "Frankly, I have no problem with evolution," editor Herb Hollinger recently  wrote in the California Southern Baptist newspaper. "It seems to me to be a  valid scientific phenomenon."  </P> <P> At the evangelical Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, for example, "it  would be hard to find any of the biblical studies or theology faculty who would  hold to a creation science interpretation of Genesis," said Frederic Bush,  associate professor of Old Testament.  </P> <P> Efforts to get creationism into science "misunderstand the literary nature and  intended teaching of Genesis," Bush said. "The biblical narrative signals that  it is largely symbolic (when) it names its two principal characters Adam and  Eve," Bush said. "In Hebrew, Adam means humanity, a generic term, and the name  Eve is chosen because it is similar in sound with the Hebrew verb 'to live."'  </P></p>

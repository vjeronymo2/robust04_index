			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Midlands boosts sector with 34% lift - Differing reactions to results of two regional electricity companies Midlands Electricity yesterday gave the electricity sector a fillip when it announced a 20 per cent increase in the interim dividend and indicated that the full year rise would be about 15 per cent. The move, accompanied by an announcement that pre-tax profits for the six months to September 30 rose 34 per cent from a restated Pounds 66.7m to Pounds 89.5m, produced a 22p rise in its shares which ended the day at 675p. Other shares in the sector rose on the expectation that the remaining regional electricity companies would also announce dividend rises above expectations. Turnover was higher at Pounds 625.5m, compared with Pounds 660.7m. The dividend of 7.65p (6.35p) was paid from earnings per share of 30.1p (22.6p). The company also announced a Pounds 10 rebate to quarterly billed customers payable from January 1994. Together with the earlier reduction this would give a price reduction for the full year of 7 per cent for the average domestic customer. Midlands said total units distributed rose 2.3 per cent, with industrial sales up 1.6 per cent. 'The revival in demand has been led by the region's manufacturing sector,' said Mr Bryan Townsend, chairman. Commercial sales rose 1.7 per cent and there was 3.8 per cent growth in domestic sales. Profits from distribution profits rose by 8 per cent to Pounds 66.4m, against Pounds 61.2m, and the supply side increased from Pounds 9.6m to Pounds 17.6m. The restatement of the accounts stems from a change in coal contracts and is to 'enable the supply business cost of sales to be more closely matched with the relevant turnover'. Mr Mike Hughes, chief executive, said he expected a reduction of 400 in the workforce of the core business during the year leaving a total of 5,400 employees at the year end. In non-core activities, retailing made a loss of Pounds 500,000, against profits of Pounds 1m last year. The company said this was affected by start-up costs of joining the E&amp;S joint venture with two other regional electricity companies. 'There is no reason why the bigger business cannot make a profit but retailing will probably make a small loss this year,' said Mr Hughes. The generation business incurred a slightly smaller operating loss of Pounds 1.2m (Pounds 1.4m) as a result of development costs. The company's policy is to write off all costs as they occur when developing businesses abroad. The company is involved in potential generation projects in Turkey and China where its policy is to be an 'informed investor' typically with a 30 per cent stake in a project. COMMENT The market was no doubt pleased with Midlands' optimistic comments on the state of the local economy but what really impressed it was its statement that it had achieved a 'proper balance' between the interests of shareholders and customers. Midlands may be pressing the accelerator on profits and therefore on dividends but, the market reasons, the rebate should help it to soothe the regulator when he looks at price controls in the distribution review. Another plus for Midlands is that it is has the ability, if it needs to, to claw back a fair chunk of the Pounds 33m from customers because of previous under-recovery in tariffs. If the total dividend for the year is 22.95p, and the company suggested yesterday that figure was a reasonable expectation, the prospective yield is 4.3 per cent, about average for the recs. However, the shares may struggle to achieve a higher rating because of concerns over the company's exposure to gas and its overseas ambitions.</p>

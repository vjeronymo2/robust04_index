			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department intends to examine the effect of the proposed grazing fee during the phase-in period to determine the need for any adjustment in the fee formula.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> New provisions have been added to the proposed rule that would provide for an incentive-based grazing fee and would restrict implementation of the $3.96 base value in the event a separate regulation setting forth eligibility criteria is not issued by 1997. In recent years the Department has considered several proposals for incentive-based grazing fees targeted at permittees and lessees who have improved rangelands, contributed to healthy, functional ecological conditions, and fostered the achievement of resource condition objectives. The Public Rangelands Improvement Act (43 U.S.C. 1901  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) and the Taylor Grazing Act provide authority for the Department to implement incentive-based grazing fees. The Department recognizes that an incentive-based fee would be a valuable tool for encouraging stewardship. It was not possible to develop proposed eligibility criteria for the incentive-based fee in time to include them in Rangeland Reform '94. However, in anticipation of the issuance of a separate rule setting forth eligibility criteria, the Department has included in the proposed rule a 30 percent reduction in the grazing fee for permittees and lessees who meet the criteria. The 30 percent reduction would be implemented in the first grazing year after the Department issues a separate final rule setting forth the eligibility criteria. These criteria would focus primarily upon those permittees and lessees who agree to participate in special rangeland improvement programs characterized by best management practices, the furtherance of resource condition objectives, and comprehensive monitoring. The Department anticipates that eligibility criteria would require the permittee or lessee to undertake management practices beyond those otherwise required by law and regulation to benefit the ecological health of the public rangelands.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To ensure timely development of that rule, this proposed rule would provide that an alternative base value of $3.50 would be implemented in 1997 if the Department has not completed the eligibility criteria. The Department intends to use its best efforts to issue a final rule establishing incentive criteria in time to provide an opportunity for the reduced fee in grazing year 1996. Such a discount would result in a grazing fee of $2.77 per AUM in 1996 and 1997 for qualifying permittees and lessees. Reviewers are asked to provide suggested criteria for qualifying for the reduced fee that address the improvement and maintenance of rangeland health, the furtherance of resource condition objectives, and comprehensive monitoring.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Public Participation in Rangeland Management  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An important element of true rangeland reform involves allowing more Americans to have a say in the management of their public lands. The American rangelands can be_and are_used for far more than grazing. Hiking, birding, fishing, hunting, and mountain biking are among the activities that are compatible with sound grazing practices. All of the public interests will be served by the public lands as long as all of the public interests are represented when decisions are being made. Thus, increased public participation is essential to bringing lasting changes to management of our public lands.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Included in this general category are proposals for the formation of multiple resource advisory councils in most BLM administrative districts and the involvement of the multiple resource advisory councils in the development of standards and guidelines for grazing, a provision allowing multiple resource advisory councils to establish and select members of rangeland resource teams and technical review teams for the purpose of providing input to be used by the resource advisory council in developing recommendations, removal of references to the National Public Lands Advisory Council, district advisory councils, and grazing advisory boards, and modification of how interested members of the public can become involved in specific grazing decisions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / CBI cautious on start of recovery SHOP SALES grew in the year to March at their fastest rate since November 1991 but the improvement in sales is not yet firmly established, the Confederation of British Industry reported yesterday. Sales volumes last month were up on a year ago for the third consecutive month, but the CBI warned that the increase in spending had not yet spread to all sectors of the high street. A consumer confidence survey from Gallup also cautioned against excessive optimism about the recovery, finding that only a fifth of 2,000 respondents thought the financial position of their household would improve over the next 12 months. The latest Gallup survey, conducted on behalf of the European Commission, suggests that people are very cautious about the strength and durability of any recovery, with the March Budget making little positive impact on confidence. In its monthly distributive trades survey the CBI reported that recent sales growth has been concentrated mainly in the large chain stores and mail-order companies, while small chain stores continue to report sluggish sales. Individual retailers still report trade down on a year ago. Overall, retailers indicated that sales for the time of year were only a little below levels they would consider average for the time of year. The survey shows the outlook for wholesalers is promising. Last month there was a strong year-on-year increase in sales volumes, compared with February, when sales declined. Wholesalers were also able to reduce stock levels in March following the better sales, in spite of an increase in orders placed with suppliers. Motor traders reported their fourth consecutive year-on-year rise in monthly sales in March, with both vehicle sales and sales of parts and accessories up. The Gallup survey found that 20 per cent of the people interviewed expect the financial position of their household to improve over the next 12 months. This was the same as in March, but lower than in January and February. Gallup said: 'The so-called feelgood factor is not being widely felt by consumers.' It added there were signs of improvement in the economy in general, however. Three in 10 expect the general economic situation to improve over the next 12 months, only slightly less than those who expect to see it deteriorate.</p>

			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / International Company News: CBoT after-hours trade The Chicago Board of Trade will launch its long-delayed after-hours computer trading system on October 20, writes Laurie Morse in Chicago. The system, known as Project A, will allow traders to use the CBoT's financial futures and options products during the late afternoons when the exchange's pits are closed. Initially, Project A trading will be open for two hours, from 2.30pm to 4.30pm local time, bridging the gap between afternoon pit closures and the start of the CBoT's night floor trading session. Later in the year, the CBoT hopes to offer overnight trading.</p>

			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / World Commodities Prices: Confusion sends coffee tumbling International coffee prices tumbled by Dollars 153 a tonne yesterday as London traders expressed confusion over Brazilian government plans to halt stockpile sales. The November futures contract in London slipped to Dollars 3,840 a tonne. Brasilia halted its weekly auction of the government coffee stockpile when it failed to dampen domestic inflation. Yesterday, influential growers' groups called on the government to restart the auctions, claiming their members would be adversely affected. International prices were boosted last week when Brasilia called a halt to the auctions with the market touching Dollars 4,060 a tonne - close to an 8 1/2 year peak. But prices dropped by Dollars 200 a tonne with speculation that the government would resume export sales.</p>

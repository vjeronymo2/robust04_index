			<p><P> February 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOUSING BOARD MOVES TO CLAMP TIGHTER RULES ON AGENCY'S CONTRACTS  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Housing Authority Board of Commissioners appointed a  special committee on Friday to tighten contracting regulations and to ensure  that the procedures are followed by Executive Director Leila Gonzalez-Correa.  </P> <P> The action came in response to a report Friday in The Times that  Gonzalez-Correa had violated federal procurement regulations on at least six  occasions while awarding Housing Authority contracts to her acquaintances and  to political supporters of Mayor Tom Bradley.  </P> <P> "The commission should play a much more active role in this," said Dori Pye,  who along with the other board members had been unaware of the contracting  irregularities. Pye added in an interview, "The rules have to be heeded. From  here on in they will be heeded. I can assure you, as a commissioner, of that."  </P> <P> Gonzalez-Correa was expected to report on the contracting violations Friday at  the request of Bradley, but was unable to attend the board meeting because she  was ill, her aides said. A Bradley spokesman said the mayor was not satisfied  with a memo explaining the violations that was submitted by Gonzalez-Correa.  </P> <P> In addition to the six violations of federal contracting procedures, The Times  also has learned that Gonzalez-Correa was told by city officials that she  should have solicited formal competitive bids in awarding other contracts, but  she ignored the warnings.  </P> <P> In one case involving the refinancing of the Owensmouth Gardens apartment  complex, Gonzalez-Correa was advised by the city attorney's office in November,  1987, and later by the chief administrative officer of procurement rules that  required her to seek other financial firms capable of handling the transaction.  </P> <P> Instead, Gonzalez-Correa continued to deal exclusively with a group of  financial consultants and lawyers that she had invited to put together the  multimillion-dollar refinancing package, records show. The financial team,  which received about $500,000 in commissions and fees, included Donald Carter,  president of Benton Mortgage Co. of Tennessee and a friend of Gonzalez-Correa,  and two Bradley allies -- former City Councilman David Cunningham and former  Congresswoman Yvonne Brathwaite Burke.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Could Be Challenged'  </P> <P> Gonzalez-Correa, with the help of Deputy Mayor Grace Davis, persuaded  commissioners to approve the Benton proposal, despite concerns expressed to her  at the time by the city attorney's office that she had failed to invite other  companies to participate.  </P> <P> "This could be challenged by other (companies) that feel they might have been  able to do as good or better a job," said Deputy City Atty. Dov Lesel,  according to transcripts. Lesel said Gonzalez-Correa avoided an outright  violation of federal contracting regulations by stating in reports that she had  made informal contacts by telephone with other firms.  </P> <P> Gonzalez-Correa also acknowledged in recent interviews that the Housing  Authority's contracting practices are in need of reform because of sloppy  accounting procedures. In several cases, Gonzalez-Correa has issued purchase  orders to her acquaintances and to Bradley supporters without requiring any  accounting of the services provided, records show.  </P> <P> In once case, Washington attorney Jane Lang received $24,666 in legal fees  after submitting monthly billing statements without the customary documentation  of services, invoices show. Lang is a former general counsel of the U.S.  Department of Housing and Urban Development who met Gonzalez-Correa several  years ago as a fellow housing lawyer.  </P> <P> "We have to institute a more careful processing of bills and all that,"  Gonzalez-Correa said in the interview. "I am going to ask Jane to send us an  absolute printout of everything she's done for the Housing Authority. Hour by  hour. She'll do it. I will take immediate steps to correct it."  </P> <P> Last month, the city attorney's office advised Gonzalez-Correa to begin using  standard employment contracts -- instead of blanket purchase orders -- to spell  out specific consulting and other services purchased by the Housing Authority.  This recommendation is among several to be considered by the special committee  of three commissioners established Friday.  </P> <P> Bradley must shoulder much of the blame for the Housing Authority's current  contracting troubles because they are strikingly similar to those that occurred  under Homer Smith, Gonzalez-Correa's successor, said City Councilwoman Joan  Milke Flores.  </P> <P> "The mayor took so much flak when Homer was there and they were good friends  and all. . . ," Flores said. "You would think that (Bradley) would say, 'I'm  going to make sure that this never happens again. I'm going to assure that  there are checks and balances and I'm going to instruct my commissioners.' "  </P> <P> Flores said she advised the Board of Commissioners several months ago to hire a  full-time analyst to keep track of spending activities by Gonzalez-Correa and  her staff. The board on Friday postponed a motion to recruit an analyst.  </P> <P> Several board members on Friday expressed surprise that Gonzalez-Correa had  issued contracts exceeding $10,000 without soliciting competitive bids or  seeking board approval as required by federal regulations and the Housing  Authority's own purchasing policy.  </P> <P> In her report on contracting practices submitted to Bradley and the board on  Friday, Gonzalez-Correa did not report three of the six procurement violations  that are documented in Housing Authority records. These involved a $44,979  training contract to Carlos Garcia, a former colleague of Gonzalez-Correa; a  $35,000 contract for legal services to attorney Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, a key  Bradley ally; and a $9,500 contract to the accounting firm of Deloitte Haskins  Sells, a Bradley contributor. All three contracts were issued by  Gonzalez-Correa without competitive bids.  </P> <P> In the case of Lang, Gonzalez-Correa reported Friday that the Housing Authority  is preparing to invite other attorneys to vie for the legal services that Lang  currently provides.  </P> <P> Officials at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the federal  agency that funds the Housing Authority, offered no reaction on Friday to the  contracting violations. HUD officials in Los Angeles were unaware of any  irregularities in the hiring of consultants or other contractors, in part  because the federal agency has not conducted a comprehensive audit of Housing  Authority books in five years, said HUD spokesman Reagan Reed. The Housing  Authority has been designated "operationally troubled" by HUD since May, 1987.  </P> <P> HUD officials "will most likely tell the Housing Authority to get its act  together" in the wake of the contracting violations, said Lesel, the deputy  city attorney who serves as the housing agency's legal counsel.  </P></p>

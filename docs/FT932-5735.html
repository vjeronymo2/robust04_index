			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / International Company News: Court holds key to Ciga's future / Examining the problems facing the Italian hotels chain CIGA, the Italian luxury hotels chain controlled by the racehorse-loving Aga Khan, faces an important hurdle next week when a Milan judge will rule on the freezing of the company's assets. A freeze on Ciga assets was provisionally granted to a group of banks owed money by Fimpar, the holding company, which controls Ciga. The move, revealed last month, led to the suspension of stock market trading in Ciga and Fimpar shares. Ciga is no stranger to suspension. Last December, trading was halted pending a last-minute rescue plan after the collapse of an earlier project to sell some of its famous hotels to raise cash. The group owns or runs some of Italy's most luxurious hotels, such as Rome's Grand and Milan's Principe di Savoia, as well as a number of top hotels outside Italy. Occupancy rates have been hit severely by recession, and expansion ahead of the 1990 soccer world cup led Ciga to invest heavily at the expense of borrowings. The upshot has been a string of losses in recent years. The net loss for 1992 was L251.9bn (Dollars 172.2m), up from a loss of L98.8bn in 1991, on revenues of L510bn. Group borrowings are now believed to be about L1,200bn. It is debt which has triggered the latest crisis for the group. The share suspensions followed legal action by IMI Bank, the German subsidiary of a leading Italian investment banking and long-term lending group, which led a Dollars 100m three-year revolving credit facility for Fimpar. The facility matured on May 4, and was not renewed pending negotiations between Fimpar and its creditors. Those talks are still going on. Apart from the stake in Ciga, Fimpar's main assets comprise an 11.7 per cent shareholding in the Sardinia-based airline, Meridiana. Although IMI Bank's move looks like a direct attack on Fimpar to force repayment of the Dollars 100m credit, analysts say the strategy is more complex. While Fimpar owes its banks money, the bulk of the borrowings by the Aga Khan's companies is by Ciga. Ciga's bankers, which have been conducting separate rescheduling and rescue talks with the company, approved in March a plan to give Mediobanca, the Milan-based merchant bank, the mandate to seek a solution to its problems. That is likely to involve the direct sale of some assets or a big capital increase reserved for one or more outside partners. The depressed state of the property market and the failure of Goldman Sachs, appointed by Ciga to find buyers for some hotels last year, to come up with acceptable offers, suggests a capital increase is the most likely recourse. But diluting Fimpar's stake in Ciga, which is now just in excess of 50 per cent, does not appeal to Fimpar's bank creditors. Dilution of the stake in its biggest and most valuable asset affects Fimpar's creditworthiness - triggering the bankers' legal moves. Matters are complicated by the fact that different banks lent to Ciga and Fimpar. Only Barclays and Banca di Roma lent to both; the other Fimpar banks do not necessarily have the same priorities as Ciga's bank creditors. Earlier this year Ciga's bankers turned down a Ciga-inspired rescue scheme which would have brought in an outside investor to raise cash. The banks' objection was that the deal, which involved the sale of a majority stake in the hotel-owning Ciga Immobiliare property subsidiary, undervalued the assets. Less publicly, there may also have been some uneasiness about the source of funds and identity of the buyer, a private Italian property and leisure group, Situr. Mediobanca's rescue plan will not be ready before Ciga's annual meeting at the end of this month. Once unveiled, it must still be approved by the banks. Then Mediobanca has to find one or more companies prepared to invest in Ciga. It may be a good long-term prospect, given present depressed property prices and the large amounts already spent to upgrade many hotels. But before that can happen, Ciga, Fimpar and their bankers must resolve their latest disagreement. Many analysts believe IMI Bank's freeze is a tactical move to gain representation at the Ciga banks' negotiating table - from which all Fimpar's lenders except Barclays and Banca di Roma are excluded. If that is all, the problem should not drag on too long. But even then, Ciga, Fimpar and the Aga Khan will have to find a long-term solution for the group.</p>

			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Premier Land makes Pounds 17.6m acquisitions Premier Land, the property investment company, has acquired the Waterdale Shopping Centre, Doncaster, from British Land for Pounds 13m and a portfolio of freehold retail shops from Landrake Investments, part of Berkeley de Veer, for Pounds 4.55m. The company is also placing some 42.9m shares with institutions at 7p to raise Pounds 3m to part fund the acquisitions, with Pounds 1.25m being retained to provide working capital. The balance will be satisfied through a mixture of cash, the issue of shares to the vendors, a loan from British Land and bank borrowing. British Land will initially receive 5m shares and has the option on a further 16.7m as repayment of Pounds 2m of the loan. Premier said that as a result of the deals its rental income would exceed all debt servicing and overhead costs.</p>

			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Property warning on corporate borrowing THE DECLINE in commercial property values could force corporate borrowing to fall by a third over the coming year, the Centre for Economics and Business Research, an economic consultancy, says in a report. The document is one of the first attempts to study the impact of commercial property prices on corporate economic activity. It finds a 'strong link' between company borrowings and property prices and suggests that a further 10 per cent drop in property prices would reduce corporate borrowing by Pounds 9.7bn over two years. Mr Douglas McWilliams, the report's author, concludes that companies are unlikely to resume borrowing on a significant scale until 1995 at the earliest. 'This will hold back economic growth and make a recovery in industrial capacity more difficult to achieve,' he says. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which commissioned the report, said it would use the research to convince policymakers of the wider economic implications of changing commercial property values. The report says commercial property values strongly influence the willingness of banks to make loans and the willingness of companies to take on extra debt. Property, which represents 44 per cent of the non-financial assets in corporate balance sheets, comprises a large part of the security for corporate borrowing. A further effect on the economy from falling commercial property prices stems from the impact of low levels of corporate borrowing on monetary growth, the report says. A depressed level of corporate borrowing would also mean that companies would have to raise their profit margins to fund the investments they need to be internationally competitive.

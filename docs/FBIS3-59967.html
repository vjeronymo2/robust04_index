According to estimates, if those crops  had been harvested, they would have accounted for the production  of at least 20 tons of drugs.    Based on reports sent to the Federal Judicial Police General  Directorate, headed by Commander Adrian Carrera Fuentes, Sinaloa  State reported the manual destruction and incineration of 20  cannabis indica plantations detected in the townships of Imala,  Jesus Maria, and Batequis, and in the vicinity of the Sanaluna  Reservoir, all part of the municipality of Culiacan.    Southeast of Imala, the Federal Judicial Police destroyed,  by  reducing to ashes, approximately 31,000 marijuana plants  discovered on an expanse of 7,600 square meters. In the same  township, five more crops were burned, and an average total of  64,000 canamo bushes was detected on 16,000 square meters.    Moreover, near the Sanaluna Reservoir in Culiacan, agents  assigned to the campaign against drug production located 2,000  square meters planted with marijuana, destroying 8,000 of the  drug bushes. In the township of Bateque, an additional 7,200  plants of the same drug were uprooted and incinerated by federal  agents. In Jesus Maria and Imala, the destruction of 484 and  1,120 square meters, respectively, planted with marijuana, was  reported. In the first instance, 1,936 plants were found; and in  the second, 4,840.    The agency in Sonora State, for its part, announced that, 5  km from the settlement of Buenaventura, two more marijuana crops  were destroyed and incinerated on an area of 475 square meters.  Approximately 18,000 drug bushes were detected on that farm.  Furthermore, southeast of the Adolfo Ruiz Cortines Reservoir,  the Federal Judicial Police destroyed nearly 69,000 cannabis  indica bushes, found on an expanse of 16,900 square meters.    In Jalisco, as well, on the farm known as El Agostadero in  the municipality of Cabo Corrientes, 21,600 drug plants were  destroyed and burned, after their discovery on 5,400 square  meters of land. Implements for harvesting marijuana, a  12-caliber shotgun, and over one kg of seed of that drug were  also found there.    Finally, Federal Judicial Police forces assigned to Guerrero  State reported that, in the municipality of Zumpango de Neri, on  a site known as Las Lagunitas, nearly four hectares were found  planted with poppies. They discovered 387,000 plants on the  site, as well as 150 kg of mineral fertilizer, and hose for  irrigation.</p>

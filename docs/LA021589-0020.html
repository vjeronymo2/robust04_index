			<p><P> February 15, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TAPIA'S DOWNSTREAM DISSENTERS LOSE;  </P> <P> DOUBLING OF SEWAGE PLANT'S CAPACITY OKD  </P> <P> A plan to double the capacity of a Calabasas sewage plant to handle a coming  population explosion between Woodland Hills and Thousand Oaks has been approved  -- despite the objections of Malibu residents living downstream.  </P> <P> The capacity of the Tapia Sewage Treatment Plant will be boosted from its  existing level of 8 million gallons per day to 16 million gallons under a plan  endorsed unanimously Monday night by directors of the Las Virgenes Municipal  Water District.  </P> <P> Officials said they hope to finish the $50-million expansion by 1992 -- when as  many as 15,000 new homes will either be completed or under construction in  Westlake Village, Agoura Hills, Agoura and Calabasas.  </P> <P> The sewage plant now serves about 20,000 homes and businesses in the  120-square-mile area. Fees on developers of $2,800 per new home will pay for  the project.  </P> <P> The newly approved plan is the fourth expansion of the 23-year-old plant at the  northern end of Malibu Canyon, and officials said it is expected to be the  final one.  </P> <P> Residents of an exclusive area at the canyon's mouth -- as they have each time  the Tapia plant has expanded -- have protested the newest enlargement.  </P> <P> Malibu residents charged two weeks ago that treated effluent released by the  plant into Malibu Creek possibly contains dangerous levels of germs.  </P> <P> They said two research scientists at a Malibu Township Council seminar last  month said present methods of testing waste water for cleanliness do not reveal  some pathogenic organisms.  </P> <P> As a result, residents charged, some bacteria and viruses that could be  dangerous to humans may be escaping undetected from the plant to contaminate  Malibu Lagoon and the nearby Malibu Colony movie star enclave.  </P> <P> Those suggestions were dismissed Monday by a Las Virgenes consultant. In a  report to officials, consultant Will Stokes said one of the scientists later  maintained that her comments were taken out of context.  </P> <P> Stokes, a former general manager of the Las Virgenes district, said testing  methods are more than adequate to detect bacterial pathogens at safety levels  established by state health officials.  </P> <P> Monday's 5-0 approval by Las Virgenes officials of the plant's expansion  followed a similar Feb. 6 endorsement by the Ventura County-based Triunfo  County Sanitation District. That agency provides sewer service to the  southeastern edge of Ventura County and owns a third of the 70-acre Tapia  plant.  </P> <P> Las Virgenes district spokeswoman Diane Eaton said Tuesday that the Tapia  plant, which handles 7 million gallons of raw sewage a day, is approaching its  capacity of 8 million gallons. An $11-million expansion project to increase the  plant's daily capacity to 10 million gallons will be completed in May.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Final Expansion  </P> <P> The final expansion to 16 million gallons will involve about 18 months of  construction, Eaton said.  </P> <P> The new work will be confined to 15 acres already in use at the Tapia plant.  Space for the new equipment will be made available by moving some  sludge-handling equipment to a separate site, she said.  </P> <P> Monday's action clears the way for the district to solicit design bids for the  expansion, officials said. Before actual construction can begin, approval must  be granted by the state's Regional Water Quality Control Board, the state  Coastal Commission and the Los Angeles County Regional Planning Commission.  </P> <P> Those approvals are expected to be routinely granted because of the Tapia  plant's recent record of successful operation.  </P> <P> The plant had been troubled in the past by breakdowns and accidental discharges  of raw sewage -- including one failure eight years ago that sent 5.5 million  gallons of sewage a day into Malibu Creek and forced county health officials to  close 65 miles of beaches to swimmers for two weeks.  </P> <P> But last year, the Tapia plant was named the best facility of its type in the  United States by the federal Environmental Protection Agency. Earlier in 1988,  it was proclaimed the best in Southern California by regional EPA officials.  </P></p>

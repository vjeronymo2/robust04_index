			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Health Effects Assessment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The toxicity of Mn varies according to the route of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure. By ingestion, Mn has relatively low toxicity at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> typical exposure levels due in part to a low rate of absorption  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the gastrointestinal tract and in part to efficient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation by homeostatic mechanisms. Manganese is considered a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nutritionally essential trace element and is required for certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enzymes important for normal functioning of the central nervous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system and other body organs. However, by inhalation, Mn has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been known since the early 1800s to be toxic to workers. It  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be noted that Mn occupational studies predominantly (and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sometimes exclusively) involve men. Neurobehavioral,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respiratory, and reproductive effects are the primary features of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> excessive occupational exposure to Mn. Manganism is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> characterized by various psychiatric and movement disorders, with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> some general resemblance to Parkinson's disease in terms of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> difficulties in the fine control of some movements, lack of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facial expression, and involvement of underlying neuroanatomical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and neurochemical factors. Neurobehavioral effects of Mn  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intoxication are generally more clinically prominent than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respiratory or reproductive effects. However, respiratory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effects (e.g., pneumonitis) and reproductive dysfunction (e.g.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduced libido) are also frequently reported features of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occupational Mn intoxication. The available evidence is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inadequate to determine whether or not Mn is carcinogenic; some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reports suggest that it may even be protective against cancer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on this mixed but insufficient evidence, EPA has placed Mn  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in a Group D weight-of-evidence category, which signifies that it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is not classifiable as to human carcinogenicity. Given these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> features of Mn toxicity, the health assessment focuses on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential for chronic noncancer effects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Various epidemiological studies of male workers exposed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mn at average levels below the current American Conference of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Governmental Industrial Hygienists Threshold Limit Value (TLV) (5  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mg/m <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  <FOOTCITE>)</FOOTCITE>  <FOOTCITE></FOOTCITE>  <FOOTCITE>55</FOOTCITE>  have shown neurobehavioral, reproductive, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respiratory effects, both by objective testing methods and by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> workers' self-reported symptoms on questionnaires.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Neurobehavioral effects generally have reflected disturbances in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the control of hand movements (e.g., tremor, reduced hand  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> steadiness) and/or the speed of movement (e.g., longer reaction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time, slower finger-tapping speed). Reproductive effects have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included a decrease in the number of children born to Mn-exposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> workers (compared to matched controls) and various self-reported  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> symptoms of sexual dysfunction. In recent studies at low to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> moderate occupational exposure levels, respiratory effects have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been reflected primarily in self-reported symptoms of respiratory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tract illnesses rather than in differences between objective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pulmonary function measurements in Mn-exposed and control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> workers. However, the lack of studies using more sensitive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investigational methods and the existence of some limited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evidence from an epidemiological study of school children raise a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> degree of concern about pulmonary function effects in relation to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lower level Mn exposure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 55 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (1992) has given notice of intent to lower the TLV to 0.2 mg/m3. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The precise mechanisms of Mn neurotoxicity are not well  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> understood, but it appears that Mn can affect several different  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aspects of central nervous system (CNS) function and structure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some experimental evidence suggests that the mechanisms of Mn  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> toxicity may depend on the oxidation state of Mn. However, both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the trivalent form (Mn <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3+ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) and the divalent form (Mn <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 2+ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrated to be neurotoxic. <FOOTCITE>56</FOOTCITE>  Also, both forms of Mn can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cross the blood-brain barrier, although research suggests that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mn <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3+ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is predominantly transported bound to the protein  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transferrin (Aschner and Gannon, 1994), whereas Mn <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 2+ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  may enter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the brain independently of such a transport mechanism (Murphy et  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> al., 1991). Unlike ingested Mn, inhaled Mn is transported  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directly from the respiratory system to the vicinity of the brain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before its first pass by the liver. Depending on the form of Mn  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inhaled, its conversion to other oxidation states (e.g.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> oxidation of Mn <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 2+ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to Mn <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3+ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  or reduction of Mn <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 4+ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to Mn <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3+ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), and its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ability to enter the brain (through a protein transport mechanism  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or otherwise), it is quite possible that a significant fraction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of even small amounts of inhaled Mn would be able to reach target  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sites in the CNS. Thus, the apparently greater toxicity of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inhaled versus ingested Mn may reflect important pharmacodynamic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and pharmacokinetic differences of Mn that enters the body by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different routes. A more definitive understanding of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issues will require more empirical information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 56 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Various elements can exist in more than one form of charged atom, depending on the number of negatively charged and positively charged particles contained in the atom. Manganese is one such element where, depending on the number of charged particles associated with the atom, the atom may have a net charge of two or three ``plus'' charges resulting in a ``divalent'' or ``trivalent'' form, respectively. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Earlier Assessments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Earlier ORD health assessments have been based on the RfC,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which is defined as an estimate (with uncertainty spanning about  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an order of magnitude) of a continuous inhalation exposure level  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the human population (including sensitive subpopulations)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that is likely to be without appreciable risk of deleterious  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noncancer effects during a lifetime. The basic procedure for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> derivation of an RfC entails identifying a no-observed-adverse-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect level (NOAEL) and a lowest-observed-adverse-effect level  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (LOAEL) from a ``principal'' study, generally defined as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available study that best defines the highest NOAEL or lowest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> LOAEL for the most sensitive endpoint affected by a chemical.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When an investigation of occupationally exposed humans is the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> principal study (as in the case of the Mn RfC), the NOAEL or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> LOAEL is adjusted for differences in ventilation rates and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure durations between the occupational exposure scenario  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (10 m3 air breathed per 8-h workday, 5 days/week) and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``general public'' scenario (20 m3 air breathed per 24-h day,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7 days/week). The adjusted NOAEL or LOAEL is then divided by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> uncertainty factors and a modifying factor. In the case of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> original (1990) RfC for Mn, uncertainty factors of 10 each were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used for extrapolating from a healthy worker population to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general population (including sensitive subpopulations) and for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extrapolating from a LOAEL to a NOAEL. Also, an uncertainty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factor of 3 (approximately one-half of 10 on a log scale) was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used for extrapolating from subchronic to chronic exposure. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modifying factor of 3 was used because of statements by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authors of the principal study (Roels et al., 1987) that past  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure levels of workers in the subject study were probably  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lower than those measured at the time the study was conducted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The resulting RfC of 0.4  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> g Mn/m3 was used for the earlier ORD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> risk assessment (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1990) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was entered on EPA's IRIS computer database of human health risk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and regulatory information in December 1990.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

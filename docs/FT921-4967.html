			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Buying into Mexico's new elite / A report on the privatisation of the nation's banks On Sunday night, a group of Mexican investors led by Mr Eduardo Creel, a former broker who made his fortune in Mexico's money markets, won a privatisation auction with an astonishing bid of Dollars 846m, or 29 times last year's earnings. This was for a medium-sized Mexican bank that has been beset by bad loans and which many outside Mr Creel's group of investors doubt will thrive. While 29 times earnings was the highest multiple paid yet in the Mexican bank privatisation programme, few in Mexico seemed surprised, for the financial community has become accustomed to such elevated prices. Bancreser fetched 50 times earnings, but only because profits for the year were abnormally low. In the past nine months, the government has sold 12 banks in competitive auctions for 30.75bn pesos (Dollars 10bn), at an average of 21 times historic earnings. Worldwide, a privatised bank is generally valued at around 14 times earnings, according to First Boston, the investment bank advising Mexico on the privatisations. The newly formed financial groups, comprising privatised banks and brokerages, are now among the biggest groups in the world by market value. As critics point out, these groups are in effect controlled by just a few thousand wealthy Mexican investors. Banamex-Accival - the holding company comprising Banamex, Mexico's largest bank, and the brokerage house Accival - is worth around Dollars 7.7bn, compared with Dollars 5.84bn for Citicorp. The government is in the enviable position of being chastised for selling the banks for too much. Mr Mario Rodriguez, director of banking at Grupo Pulsar, a large conglomerate, warns: 'No one in their right mind would pay 3.7 times book value and expect their money back in under 75 years.' Pulsar is waiting for the second round, when it hopes to pick up a bank cheaply. Many Mexicans say the government is in fact selling power, or status, to which money is no object. As Mr Rodriguez says: 'The new bankers are buying membership to a very distinguished club.' Another Mexican broker put it differently: 'We have no nobility and this is the closest thing. It is the search for permanence in an impermanent world.' The Mexican banks, unlike the money chasing them, date back to the 19th century. They were nationalised in 1982 by Mr Jose Lopez Portillo, who was then president. The banks' buyers are quick to point out more prosaic reasons for the high prices. They note that in the past, Mexico's financial sector has grown twice as fast as the economy. Given the rosy forecasts of average economic growth of 5 per cent over the next decade, bank earnings should increase by 10 per cent over the same period. Furthermore, Mexican banks are generally inefficient, use outdated technology and are overmanned. This, they say, shows that there is room to cut costs. Mr Guillermo Ortiz, the Mexican government minister who has masterminded the bank sales, stoutly defends the prices paid. Mexico, he says, is relatively under-banked. He foresees 'a very lucrative market in consumer credit and small businesses in the future', especially since the government has recently eliminated the liquidity coefficient (akin to a reserve requirement) on bank lending. Such arguments persuaded Baring Research, the Mexico branch of the brokerage Baring Securities, to recommend Banamex-Accival (Banacci), Mexico's largest financial group, for a 'long-term buy', and forecast average annual growth of earnings of 12.3 per cent over the decade. Nevertheless, Barings highlights considerable risks. As the brokerage says: 'This favourable sectoral outlook is clouded by the uncertain outcome of Mexico's big bang, involving several simultaneous changes in the financial sector - deregulation, privatisation, broker-bank mergers into financial groups, and entry of foreign institutions.' The deregulation of Mexico's financial sector, and the imminent arrival of foreign banks with the likely passage of the North American free trade agreement, is likely to introduce considerably more competition, and cut profit margins. Currently, the spread between borrowing and lending is around 6 per cent, about twice that in western Europe. Foreigners are likely to team up with Mexico's stronger banks, leaving the weaker ones even more vulnerable. This week Bancomer, the second largest bank, launches the road show for an international public offering for Dollars 500m, to be shortly followed by a similar offering by Banamex. Last week, Banamex formed a joint venture with American Express to provide financial services in Mexico. In the fight for the share of the retail market, Mexico's large banks - even without foreign help - will be at an advantage relative to the medium and small ones, since their average costs tend to be lower. As one US bank analyst remarks: 'It's one thing to pay 12 to 14 earnings for 30 per cent market share (for example, Banamex). But paying 20 to 25 earnings for a 3 to 5 per cent market share, without a distinct market niche: how do you justify that?' But at this late stage, with just six banks left on the block, passion may have overtaken reason. The last two banks have gone for record sums, as competition between frustrated investors has heated up. Many of those still without banks have promised to carry on bidding high until they win. The government likes to say the sure winners are Mexico's taxpayers, who will finally get hold of some of the money hoarded by Mexico's super-rich. But the strategy is not without its risks. Financial power has been handed over to a small group of people who already control much of Mexico's wealth.</p>

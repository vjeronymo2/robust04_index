			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / International Company News: Bad loans shatter a broker's biggest dream - The house is paying for over-expansion during the 'bubble' era When officials from the Bank of Tokyo, Daiwa Bank and Nippon Credit Bank moved into Sanyo Securities in August to help with its restructuring programme, they expected the worst. 'We thought we would have to deal with all sorts of irregular deals and illicit transactions done during the 'bubble' period,' says one banker. Sanyo's broking books, however, proved to be financially healthier than feared. Mounting bad loans at its finance subsidiaries turned out to be the core problem. It took months of haggling for Sanyo, its creditor banks and Nomura Securities, its largest shareholder, to put together a restructuring deal agreeable to all. Sanyo is one of Japan's 10 medium-sized broking houses which rank below the Big Four - Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko and Yamaichi. The second-tier brokers proved more vulnerable than their bigger counterparts to volatile share prices, mainly because of increased costs stemming from over-expansion in the late 1980s, and the lack of financial reserves. For Sanyo, which has been one of the most aggressive among the middle-rankers, the restructuring plan announced yesterday symbolises the death of grand ambitions. Mr Yoichi Tsuchiya, Sanyo president, anticipating the reduction of barriers between the banking and securities industries, saw the company becoming a large financial conglomerate with broking and banking as its two main pillars. It built a huge Y8bn (Dollars 75.7m) trading office in central Tokyo, and ploughed cash into its finance subsidiaries, which in turn lent aggressively to property concerns. Mr Tsuchiya was hailed as one of Japan's most successful young businessmen. Had the stock market continued to rise, along with trading volumes, Sanyo would have been among the handful of brokers with the operational capacity to cope. The plunge in Japanese shares, however, put paid to the medium-sized brokers' ambitions to join the ranks of the Big Four. Weaker houses have been forced to seek help from key shareholders. Cosmo Securities was bailed out by Daiwa Bank last year, becoming a subsidiary, while Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank extended support for Kankaku Securities through subordinated loans. And analysts expect to see more bail-outs of medium-tier securities houses. Japan's ministry of finance is anxious to prevent brokers failing and so further weaken frail investor confidence. It is twisting the arms of banks and larger brokers with large shareholdings in the weak brokers to help with their restructuring. The main problem facing medium-sized brokers is that most have been unsuccessful in diversifying their revenue sources. They are highly geared to equity commissions, and in most cases are twice as dependent on such commissions as the top four. Nomura, for example, derives only one-fifth of its revenues from equity commissions. Reduced ability to cut costs may also hurt the medium-sized brokers. On average, they have succeeded in cutting costs by between 10 and 20 per cent in the two years to last March, but financial analysts point out that the room for further cost-cutting is limited. Most of the second-tier brokers have already cut personnel costs by reducing salaries and overtime and streamlining branch networks. Further streamlining may hurt client bases. However, Ms Alicia Ogawa, financial specialist at Salomon Brothers, says brokerages are taking comfort in the slight upturn in the Tokyo stock market. She says that as long as current market conditions remain, the brokers will 'continue to limp along,' unless, of course, they are hit by a very big loss.</p>

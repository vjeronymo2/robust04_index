			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Homes Assured jury in hotel THE JURY in the Homes Assured Corporation fraud trial was sent to a hotel last night after failing to reach a verdict. The three women and eight men have spent four months in Southwark Crown Court hearing more than 100 prosecution witnesses give evidence against the group's founder, Mr Anthony Dobson, and two other former directors, on charges arising from the venture's Pounds 10.7m collapse four years ago. The 60-year-old businessman, of Glebe Place, Chelsea, south-west London, who set up the corporation in 1987 to help council tenants buy their homes, denies trading fraudulently between November 1988 and August 1989. HAC managing director Mr Michael Robinson, 42, of Edith Terrace, Fulham, south-west London, and Mr Keith Woodward, 56, of Blake Hall Road, Wanstead, east London, also deny the charge. Mr Dobson also denies two charges of procuring the execution of a valuable security by deception and Woodward denies one charge of furnishing false information. The jury will resume deliberations today.</p>

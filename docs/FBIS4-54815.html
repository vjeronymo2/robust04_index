			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Mariusz Janicki: "Who the President Listens to; </F> Theoretically, the President Has a Few Hundred Advisers"]    [Text] The president is not able to know everything, even  though he must rule the entire state--that is, everything.  Therefore, he should have advisers--people who, for free or for  a fee, share their knowledge with the head of state. The  president may, but he does not have to, accept their  suggestions. As it turns out, in practice, he most often "does  not have to."    The president has almost 700 advisers, not counting his  closest aides in the Office. These are members of the  presidential councils, of which there are 12. another one is  being established--the council for veteran affairs. This costs  the President's Office approximately 700 million zlotys per  year--the return of the costs, hotels, and mineral water. There  have already been cases of returning money for air tickets on  international routes (a member of the council for sport issues)  and for a journey in a state car with a driver (a member of the  scientific council). Added to this are printing costs--whatever  is invented by the councils is printed--sometimes in the form of  thick books. The councils also receive meals, even though their  members complain about the quality.    Among the president's advisers are over 150 professors and  more than 200 scientists with lesser titles. There are 10  priests and one bishop. Only five persons are called "lawyers."  Moreover, the councils include journalists, peasants, sportsmen,  scouts, writers, artists, businessmen, architects, and  politicians. As a matter of fact, there are not many well-known  and active politicians, apart from Bronislaw Geremek and  Aleksander Malachowski. Incidentally, their roles are apolitical  there.    The councils convene every second month, on average. The  teams into which they are usually divided may meet more  frequently. The president tries to attend every third meeting  of each council, but he does not always make it. In practice, he  attends the session of each council once a year. He has not yet  met with the council for youth affairs. How, then, does he find  out about the councils' advice? "In various ways--for example,  from the press. It is always known when a meeting of one of the  councils has been held. Apart from that, there are reports. It  is not true that the president does not read anything. He likes  theoretical political works, for instance, or reminiscences of  politicians very much. Moreover, sessions are attended by his  civil servants," says Minister Andrzej Zakrzewski, head of the  Bureau of Political Servicing of the Office (he coordinates the  activities of eight councils). The councils are supposed to act  entirely independently. If the president wants to ask them about  something, he will do so. It is worth adding that he does this  rarely. Moreover, the councils were established as a result of  initiatives of the people themselves: They came and said that  they wanted to establish a council with the president. This  gives importance. Therefore, their expectations cannot be too  great. Recently, the president stated that he does not want any  more councils, but the veterans still managed to ask for their  own council. The employees of education may not have such a  chance. "If we had accepted all of the motions, there would  already be 50 councils," claims Andrzej Kojder, the main expert  in the Political Servicing Bureau. Thus, all along, the  councils have been in the wrong place--they were left far from  the decisionmaking processes. They turned into discussion clubs  that at some higher level are taken care of by Lech Walesa.  Therefore, the thesis submitted by the Belweder's opponents  that the councils would be the basis of a presidential  government is not very realistic.    The councils are not satisfied with the president: He  attends their sessions only rarely. It is not known to what  extent he takes advantage of the experts' efforts. He does not  give any feedback. Nor is the president satisfied with the  councils: He says that they have become another forum at which  the complaints and frustrations of various milieus are  discussed, that their members simply want to get something done  via the Belweder, that they do not submit any legislative  drafts, even though the president has the right to launch a  legislative initiative. He presents his complaints right at  those meetings. A. Zakrzewski: "The president at one point  interrupts a speaker and says: I am not satisfied with you all.  Tell me what I should do, give me addresses, telephone numbers;  work on a joint stand." Lech Falandysz, deputy of the head of  the Office (he coordinates the work of two councils; one council  is taken care of by Andrzej Kozakiewicz, and the council for  media affairs by the President's Press Office) adds: "In  general, Lech Walesa is not keen on lawyers. The same goes for  Mieczyslaw Wachowski, who is very businesslike with me. Walesa  probably no longer considers me a lawyer, and this is why he  tolerates me. He is a practical man, and he often emphasizes  it. His presidency is of an amateurish-sentimental, not  professional, nature, and that is all right with me. I could  not work with another president."    There are better councils and there are worse councils; much  depends on the chairman. Andrzej Kajetan Wroblewski, who steers  the scientific council with an iron hand, is listed as a model  to follow. Also, the councils for agriculture and social policy  work quite well. The former established contacts with Minister  Smietanko. It is believed in the Office that the other councils  should also meet with appropriate ministers; rhaps then they  will become more specific and useful. However, not all of the  ministers want that because, in fact, the councils are  presidential not governmental.    The creative work that has been accomplished by the councils  is various. Apart from issues that are really serious and  strategic, in the list of achievements one finds such items as:  "obtaining additional money for publishing a book by U.S. Vice  President Al Gore," "declaration for Polish public opinion,  expressing concern about the political climate in Poland," or  "the resolution of a conflict related to the Frederic Chopin  Society." Just as the president does not have a concept for the  councils, the councils do not have a concept for themselves.  The plenary sessions of the councils are more like a  stereotype; their structure is more that of a seminar than of an  advisory body: attendance list, opening address, discussion,  conclusions, setting the date and the subject of the next  session. Attendance is not very good. And all of this is  happening in a vacuum. The councils' members are rather  unanimous in saying that they do not really know whether the  council is simply the prolongation of their scientific work and  they are supposed to behave as they do at their universities, or  it requires effort and a different attitude from them. However,  there is no feedback for that.    Andrzej Kojder believes that there are too many well-known  people in the councils who also have a hundred other tasks, who  are members of various bodies, and for whom membership in the  presidential council is a matter of prestige. They would very  gladly meet with the president in the salons of the Belweder and  drink coffee with him there. However, the president does not  have time for that.    Indeed, the councils swarm with prominent names. One  cannot say no to the president. There was only one such case: A  representative of the Independent Association of University  Students [NZS], who was invited to become a member of the  council for youth affairs, rejected the offer because the NZS  had not liked the president for some time then. Still, members  of the councils are such people as Jerzy Turowicz, Piotr  Buchner, Gustaw Holoubek, Adam Michnik, Leszek Balcerowicz,  Wieslaw Ochman, Marcin Krol, Sobieslaw Zasada, Bronislaw  Geremek, Jan Nowak-Jezioranski, Ryszard Kapuscinski, Father  Wieslaw Nieweglowski, Aleksander Gieysztor, Lena Kolarska-  Bobinska, Henryk Samsonowicz, Marek Rostworowski, and many  others. These are all first-league people. There arises the  question, then, why contact with the president is so poor and  why the advisory usefulness of the councils is so small. Only  twice did the president quote the opinions of the councils when  he made a decision: when he agreed to the candidacy of Zbigniew  Klajnert for culture minister in the Suchocka government and,  for the second time and not so directly, in the case of the  self-governmental election law, which he finally vetoed.  Andrzej Zakrzewski: "Giving advice to Lech Walesa is difficult,  extremely difficult. It must be done very skillfully, and much  patience is required. At the start, the president most often  does not want to listen to anything. Later on, when he thinks  about it quietly, reads something, he sometimes changes his  mind." Lech Falandysz: "Telling the president that he is to do  this or that, or at least that he should do this or that, is out  of the question. The entire issue can be forgotten. The style  favored in the Belweder is that of the military: If something is  pulled off, no one will commend you; if not, you will be  reprimanded. People must often work and say things they think  they should. Lech Walesa wants to have not advisers but  generals, who would present him with several options; he would  then choose one or think about his own option. This is why the  professorial style of giving advice, full of reservations and  doubts, does not satisfy him." Another Office civil servant,  who wanted to remain anonymous, claims that the concept of  advice-giving bodies is not very good now. The Research and  Analysis Office does not really fulfill its function. The  20-person legal office, which, among other things, reviews all  of the laws before they are signed by the president, must often  give up its suggestions when it hears political arguments.  There are no good relations between the law and politics. There  is no advisory body that would have powers in both these areas,  which would include outstanding specialists capable of  convincing Lech Walesa of their political abilities, which is  not easy because the president believes that he is the greatest  political talent in the country--the greatest and the only  talent. Besides, the president would have to trust such people,  and this may be the most difficult matter.    Andrzej Zakrzewski: "Lech Walesa had bad experiences with  political advisers at the time they were led by Zdzislaw Najder.  After the Belweder was conquered by the Center Accord, the  entire milieu linked to the Democratic Union moved away from  him. The situation has not changed up to now. The president  lacks this potential. It will not be replaced by existing  councils, even if they are twice as numerous."    It looks like the president receives various, poorly  coordinated signals, both important and not very important, on  the basis of which he makes his decisions. Therefore, the  decisions often mirror the nature and the level of the advice  the head of state receives. Perhaps the situation looks like  this: He does not trust those people who might give him sound  advice, and those he trusts give such advice as they can give.  Three years ago, my colleagues in POLITYKA wrote about the  "loneliness of Mr. President." Since that time, many people  have come and gone from the Belweder; however, the president  still seems to be alone, even though he has a few hundred  advisers. It is not known for sure whether this is a choice or  a necessity.</p>

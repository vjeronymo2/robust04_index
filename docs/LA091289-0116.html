			<p><P> September 12, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOYS' TENNIS COACH AT UNIVERSITY HIGH RESIGNS  </P> <P> Gary Sisel has resigned his coaching position at University High School after  18 years as the school's first and only boys' tennis coach.  </P> <P> Sisel, 45, said his decision wasn't prompted by any dissatisfaction.  </P> <P> "It's just been a heck of a lot of fun," he said. "I thought it was time for me  to move on."  </P> <P> Under Sisel, University had qualified for the Southern Section playoffs 18  consecutive seasons. Sisel said one of his biggest thrills came when the  Trojans won the 5-A championship in 1987. They stopped a 69-match winning  streak by Santa Barbara in the championship match.  </P> <P> Sisel will be replaced by Josh Davis, a Latin teacher at the school who also  coaches the girls' junior varsity tennis and basketball teams. Davis has also  assisted the boys' tennis team for two years.  </P> <P> Sisel will continue teaching Spanish and physical education.  </P> <P> Mike Bova, who served as Sisel's assistant coach for 12 years, also resigned.  The two have applied for the open position of golf coach.  </P> <P> "We'd like to take over the golf program and see if we can bring it to the  level we did in tennis," Sisel said.  </P></p>

			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Survey of International Standards (1): The starting point is an agreement - It is the voluntary nature of standards that makes them valuable and workable Zigzagging across the South African city of Johannesburg is a reminder of what can happen when standards differ. The jagged line of Twist Street commemorates the point at which the two city planners - working inward to the same grid plan - finally met, about 100 years ago. The hazards of Twist Street's staggered junctions are due, so the story goes, to the fact that one builder worked in metres, the other in yards and inches. True or apocryphal, it is an example of the problems which are caused for consumers by the lack of standards. The starting point of standards has to be an agreement on the physical measures which are going to be used, a problem which new technologies have always had to surmount. Travellers on Britain's early railroads, for example, had to change trains between different rail tracks, and engines had to be built to different specifications, until the gauge was nationally agreed by railway engineers in the nineteenth century at 4ft 8 1/2 in. In both these cases, those most inconvenienced were the 'consumers' whose travel times were increased by the absence of a common standard. More recently, the absence of a common video cassette standard, before the eventual triumph of the VHS system over its Betamax rival, led to similar confusion and inconvenience for customers. The railway example pre-dates the setting up of the International Organisation for Standardisation (Iso) by more than 100 years. This is the body which consumers have to thank, with its partner the International Electrotechnical Commission, for many of the things they take for granted. These include the ability to plug a standard light bulb into a socket, (though still in two different formats, screw and bayonet), the uniform dimensions of leading credit cards used around the world, the familiar dashboard symbols on cars indicating lights, windscreen wipers, horn and other equipment, and the conformity of paper sizes. To the IEC, in particular, goes the credit for harmonising worldwide the rules for wiring buildings, and attempts, still as yet to reach fruition, to standardise Europe's electrical plugs and sockets. (Report, Page 4). Iso has been developing standards since it was founded in 1947 and it has always operated by consensus. This is of course due to the fact that the providers of goods and services have more to gain by keeping in line with an agreed set of standards than they have to lose. The voluntary nature of standards is also what has made them valuable and workable for consumers, who are more willing to accept agreed regulations laid down for reasons of safety or compatibility than rigid external directives which are often seen as interfering with local custom and supply. From small beginnings early in this century standards now cover not only the full range of industrial products and services but newer areas of interest and concern such as environmental management. In each case, however, for standards to be accepted and effective, the working committees of Iso have had to take into account differences in climate and culture across developing and industrialised countries, and different structures and overseeing authorities. There is a reluctance to give up measures that have developed by custom and culture, and Iso has had to be sensitive to this in order to succeed. Iso's own name illustrates this. Derived from the Greek word meaning 'equal'. it was chosen because it was considered to be linguistically neutral and can be used as an international common denominator by Iso members in 107 countries. The full English title, International Organisation for Standardisation, is deliberately not an acronym. All standards are published in English and French and some also in Russian. Iso has had to be equally impartial in devising a worldwide system for measurement, a topic which is still the nub of its activities. Since it published its first standard in 1951 with the title 'Standard reference temperature for industrial length measurement', it has had to return many times to a question that arises in many guises: how to create a consensus on what should be measured, in what way, and to what standard. The metric system is now enshrined in a 14-part Iso standard covering the information needed for measurement in just about every field of business, industry, education, science and technology. At the other end of the scale, new standards in areas such as environmental management are still being developed. World Standards Day is being celebrated today by Iso, the IEC and the International telecommunications union (ITU) with the slogan 'Standards and the consumer: partners for a better world.' Its message is designed to increase awareness of the consumer's part in standards. 'Safety standards protect life and property. Their application creates safer homes and workplaces, and improves the quality of life for everyone,' the chief officers of the three organisations argue. 'The net result of industry's use of international standards is a 'level playing field' on which fair trade and competition can take place, to the benefit of consumers and society in general.' Standards, indeed, are doorways that enable goods to enter other countries, and trade to take place, on equal terms. Japan is notably ready to adapt its products to world markets. 'When the Japanese design for the world market, they certainly forget themselves and the very specific needs of their home market,' observes Mr Bill Moggridge, founder of the design consultancy Ideo. 'As international design consultants we have to come to grips with international standards. They are a good guide to the burning issues in safety, functionality, and so on. But we have to move away from standards that are unfriendly to users but kind to computer chips and connectors. The process of creating standards still lags behind the way that standards are actually applied,' Mr Moggridge says. The IEC, which was created in 1906 has a particular problem because of the fast-moving nature of the industry in which it operates. However fast it reacts to technology developments, the computer industry is always going to be moving faster. The convergence of telephone, fax, computer, copier and video in multimedia systems has led the IEC, Iso and ITU to warn that 'an electronic jungle will result unless this exciting rush of developments is channelled productively by international standards'. Yet, according to Mr John Kean, vice-president of Iso for technical management, developments in telecommunications will have the effect of educating the consumer as never before. Mr Kean gives as an example the interactive TV available to members of Canacintra, the largest Mexican chamber of commerce, for industries involved in technological transfer. 'Their 38,000 members can hook into an interactive educational channel, which deals with issues of manufacture, standards, and procedures. It is a tool of tremendous potential,' he argues. Indeed, electronic delivery of standards offers the easiest and swiftest method yet of publishing and disseminating standards information. Multimedia and interactive video promise to be seductive educational tools, which makes international agreement on multimedia standards all the more urgent. The CD-Rom has already been seized on as an ideal medium by IT experts and others. CD-Rom is among the formats available from IHS, International Handling Services, of Englewood, Colorado, which offers a library of the world's most widely-referenced standards, plus an electronic inquiry service. In Britain, IT experts can look up standards on Bits, a PC disc 'Browser' for IT standards published by the Information Technology Industry Training Organisation. Industry experts warn, however, that the electronics and software industries are racing ahead at such a speed that they are vulnerable to de facto standards. These rely entirely on the weight of the user-base, and rarely settle on the best possible technical solution. This is a problem which world standards bodies are now having to address. Despite 100 years or more of standard-making the challenges look like being no less complex in the next century as an increasingly integrated world trading environment - heavily dependent on information technology as its engine - develops apace.</p>

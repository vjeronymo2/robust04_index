			<p><P> April 14, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> COUNCILMAN, CITY IN 'FRIENDLY' SUIT OVER GARAGE SITE  </P> <P> Three years ago, after discovering that he had unwittingly built a customized  carport on city property, Ventura Councilman John McWherter faced a dilemma.  </P> <P> Under state law, elected officials cannot enter into contracts with the cities  they represent, so McWherter cannot buy the land under his carport or accept it  as a gift from the city.  </P> <P> This left McWherter with the prospect of tearing down his garage or resigning  from office -- all for a clump of land that is of no use to the city and that  was recently appraised at a mere $500.  </P> <P> Neither idea appealed to him, so the councilman came up with an original  solution -- he asked the city to sue him, in hopes that a judge would decide  the matter.  </P> <P> "I asked them to sue me; it's the only way we could do it," McWherter said.  "Then I had to countersue to give my side of the story.  </P> <P> "Actually, the countersuit was the other attorney's idea," he said, referring  to the special counsel appointed by the city attorney to handle the case on  behalf of the city.  </P> <P> "What he's trying to do is to get an equitable resolution not by contract but  through a court order, which would have the same effect as a contract," said  Alan Ashby, a spokesman for the state attorney general's office. He would not  comment on the appropriateness of such actions. "The problem arises rarely  enough that there is no normal way to deal with it."  </P> <P> Since neither McWherter nor the city could be properly represented through the  city attorney's office, both sides hired private firms to represent them. For  the past year, the dispute has been quietly and slowly working its way through  the legal process. By the time it is over, it will have cost each side about  $9,000, the councilman estimates.  </P> <P> "The City Council is our boss," said Assistant City Atty. Mike Dougherty,  explaining why he hired outside counsel. "It isn't appropriate that we go  against them."  </P> <P> The issue will be decided by a Superior Court judge in a non-jury trial  scheduled to begin July 30. If he loses, McWherter said, he will tear down his  $1,000 garage and park his 21-foot-long recreational vehicle on the driveway.  Resigning his council seat is out of the question, McWherter said. "I've been  there for 17 years and loved every minute of it. I've got two more years left  and I plan to run again."  </P> <P> McWherter's problem was discovered in October, 1987, when a city crew surveying  the adjacent property discovered that Mint Lane, which leads directly into  McWherter's garage, was about 12 yards north of where it should have been,  according to city maps.  </P> <P> McWherter, who bought his three-bedroom house in 1966, thought the surveyors  had made a mistake and asked for a remeasurement, which eventually showed that  Mint Lane had been laid down improperly when the land was subdivided in the  1920s.  </P> <P> The suit, filed last September, accuses McWherter of trespassing on city  property and seeks a restraining order to keep McWherter out of his garage.  </P> <P> "The defendants' interference, occupancy, possession and use of the disputed  property will continue, causing great and irreparable injury to the plaintiff,"  the suit alleges. It also demands payments from McWherter "for damages in an  amount to be determined."  </P> <P> Standing at the entrance of his hillside chalet one recent day, enjoying his  spectacular view of the Pacific Ocean, McWherter seemed hardly affected by the  allegations against him.  </P> <P> "That's how lawsuits work!" he cried, throwing up his hands, bursting into  laughter. "You can't go to court as a sham and tell the court 'we're buddies.'  </P> <P> "Besides, the suit didn't say how much the damages are worth, did they? That's  because the damages are zero!"  </P> <P> Dougherty seems to agree. "We're trying to work it out so the public is  protected and Mr. McWherter is protected," he said.  </P> <P> McWherter's countersuit asks the city to deed the land to his name or place it  in a trust until he retires from the council and seeks payment of his  attorney's fees.  </P> <P> Not surprisingly, the councilman is anything but troubled by the thought of  suing the city he serves. "This is a friendly lawsuit," he said. "The lawsuits  say a lot of things, but what really matters are the memos the attorneys  exchange."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the legal proceedings continue at a less than hectic pace. A  court-mandated settlement hearing scheduled for April 19 was postponed  indefinitely. That is because the attorney for the city could not fit it in his  schedule, McWherter said.  </P> <P> "The attorneys don't work long hours on this case," he said. "That's why it's  taking so long."  </P> <P> Moreover, there is no point to the settlement hearing because both McWherter  and Dougherty confirmed that no settlement will be reached because it is  illegal for the parties to enter an agreement.  </P> <P> "Nobody understands why we have to go through this," McWherter said. "The only  reason I'm in this predicament is because the city built the road in the wrong  place."  </P></p>

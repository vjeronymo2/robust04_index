			<p><P> February 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> The largest exhibition of avant-garde art in China's history has reopened in  Beijing, after being shut down by police when artists defied a ban on  performance art and a sculptor shot her own work with a BB gun. The sculptor  said she didn't regret shooting her work and that finally the piece had been  completed. "It was something I had to do, but I didn't realize it would cause  such a stir," said Xiao Lu, the 26-year-old artist. "The piece needed to be  destroyed slightly to be perfected." Xiao and her boyfriend were arrested and  spent three days in jail after the incident. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

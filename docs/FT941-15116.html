			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Trifast to raise Pounds 15m via SE listing next month Trifast, one of the UK's largest manufacturers and distributors of industrial fasteners, plans to go public on the London Stock Exchange next month in a flotation expected to raise about Pounds 15m. The deal will reduce the stake of the two founders, Mr Mike Timms and Mr Mike Roberts, from 90 per cent to between 30 and 50 per cent, and leave a sum of about Pounds 3m-Pounds 4m for the Sussex-based company. Mr Malcolm Diamond, who has been managing director since 1984, said this would be used for overseas expansion, and to replenish finances after a recent acquisition and the move of its Uckfield manufacturing operation to a larger site. Trifast, which trades as TR Fastenings, has some 70,000 different products and world rights to the Hank Rivet Bush, a form of nut used to provide a tapped hole in sheet metal, and the Binx Nut, a self-locking vibration-proof nut. About 35 per cent of its products are made in its three UK factories and the rest is bought from suppliers in east Asia, Europe and elsewhere. Mr Diamond said Trifast had weathered the recession well because of low gearing - only 17 per cent even after last year's acquisition of Edenbridge-based Fastener Techniques, a former rival. Sales have risen from Pounds 17.6m in the year ended March 1990 to an estimated Pounds 28m in the current year. Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 1.45m in 1990 to Pounds 1.98m last year, and are expected to rise considerably this year. Trifast has benefited heavily from co-operation with its customers in arrangements such as long-term partnership sourcing and fastener management, reducing its exposure to the traditional customer/supplier relationship where contracts are won purely on the basis of price. Mr Diamond hopes the flotation will provide a springboard to further expansion as Trifast's big computer and electronics customers move to single-sourcing for fasteners and increasingly subcontract their assembly work. He wants to plug gaps in Trifast's network, notably in the Republic of Ireland, and exploit untapped market opportunities. But he also sees growth possibilities in the fragmented Pounds 350m-plus UK fasteners market, where Trifast has a market share of just 7 per cent overall. Acquisitions of merchant distributors are one possibility, he said. James Capel are brokers to the company. The pathfinder document is expected on January 26.</p>

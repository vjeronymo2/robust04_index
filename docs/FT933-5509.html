			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / Iranian troops gathering on Azeri border IRANIAN troops were last night reported by the Turkish government to be massed on the border of Azerbaijan as Azeri forces continue to cede territory to Armenian units in the south-west of the country. However, the Azeris have denied reports by Russian news media that the Iranian government - which, like Turkey's, has vehemently protested against the Armenian attacks - has already sent troops into Azerbaijan itself. A spokesman for the Turkish government said after a cabinet meeting that 'the continuation of Armenia's occupation (of parts of Azerbaijan)' and Iran's build-up towards the Azeri border 'are the first concern of Turkey'. Mr Yildirim Aktuna, quoted by the Turkish Anatolian agency, said that Iran was setting up a 20km security zone on the Azeri-Iranian border to contain the Azeri refugees who are reported to be flooding into the area. Iran forms all of the southern border of Azerbaijan except for a small strip of Turkey. Forces from the Armenian-dominated Nagorno Karabakh region within Azerbaijan, which has declared independence from the former Soviet republic and has since been fighting to claim it, have taken a great swathe of territory to the west of the republic, which has resulted in a de facto attachment of Karabakh to Armenia. In the past few days, the Azeri troops have surrendered the towns of Cebrayil and Kubatli - leaving only the town of Zangelan, in the extreme south-west tip, still in Azeri hands. These reverses in the face of Armenian-Karabakh forces which have advanced steadily on all fronts for three months appears to have played into the hands of Mr Gaidar Aliev, acting head of state of Azerbaijan, who deposed President Abulfaz Elchibey in June. Mr Aliev, a veteran former first secretary of the Azeri Communist party, may attempt to use negotiations to stop the haemorrhage of his territory. The Armenians may be willing to negotiate independent status for Karabakh on the return of land, or may now be prepared to defend their gains against the obviously reluctant fighters of Azerbaijan. The people of Karabakh yesterday celebrated 'independence day' - two years since the day the independence of the enclave, and its 'reunification' with Armenia. A Karabakh spokesman told Interfax that, in five years of conflict with the Azeris, the area had lost 70 per cent of its basic industries, two thirds of its crops and 90 per cent of its cattle. Nearly one third of its population are refugees or homeless.</p>

			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / International Company News: Minolta's tricky change of focus / A look at a company facing a bleak profit picture Minolta, the Japanese camera maker, hopes that its scheduled payment today of Dollars 127.5m to settle a US patent dispute will restore confidence within an innovative company now confronted by a bleak profit picture. The dispute with Honeywell, the US technology company, over autofocus technology capped a three-year period during which Minolta's profits evaporated, its sales stagnated, and an ambitious drive into the office equipment market brought only modest results. With Minolta forecasting an Y8bn (Dollars 59m) loss for the year ending this month, its first loss for 26 years, the company shares a vulnerability with other Japanese companies which based business strategies on high quality but low profitability, and whose margins have shrunk with increasing competition and international recession. Patents aside, the Minolta case also highlights the difficulties faced by Japanese manufacturers attempting a personality change to reduce reliance on a traditional product line. These companies covered the initial expenses of transformation during the easy money era of the late 1980s, but now find themselves with excess capacity, high capital costs, and little experience in overcrowded markets. Mr Ned Moro, Minolta's general manager, along with his fellow directors, has taken a 10 per cent pay cut to show that he is accepting responsibility for the troubles of a company still proud that its technology was aboard the first US manned space mission in 1962. 'We wanted to make a direct sacrifice to encourage our employees and our shareholders,' Mr Moro said. 'We are now reviewing many things. We are reviewing expenses, and we have decided to cut capital spending. If there are projects we can delay, we may do so.' Capital spending is likely to fall to Y10bn from Y13.5bn this year but the success of the company's overhaul is more likely to depend on the course of the Tokyo stock market than on cost cutting. Minolta plans to borrow the Dollars 127.5m Honeywell payment from its banks, and will repay the money by cashing in unrealised gains on share holdings. Mr Moro said that the company would like to wait until the Tokyo market gathers strength, as its unrealised gains have fallen with the collapse of the Nikkei average. But the longer Minolta waits, the heavier the interest burden - at the end of last September those unrealised gains totalled Y58.6bn, down from Y61.3bn in March. Minolta had recognised that a shift in product emphasis was needed and, three years ago, announced a plan to reduce the camera share of total sales, to sharply increase the office equipment share, and to increase the proportion of domestic sales. The three-year target was for annual sales of Y300bn, though the company forecasts only Y220bn for the current year, and for increased sales of office equipment to push the camera share down to a third of the total - the figure last year was 44 per cent. It was hoped that domestic sales could be lifted from about 17 per cent of the total to 33 per cent, though they are now hovering around 25 per cent. 'We used to have a high market share in this country, but our founder was a pioneer and committed himself to selling in foreign markets. I don't want to say that we ignored the domestic market, but we concentrated on foreign markets,' Mr Moro explained. The strategy, he said, had left the company exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations and left it under-represented in the sophisticated Japanese market. Even domestic camera sales have turned soft in the past year, including those of the camera for which Minolta is best known, the single-lens reflex. The market contracted by 9 per cent to 761,000 units and prices fell by as much as 30 per cent, as makers rapidly introduced new models and discounted older lines. Mr Moro explained that winning market share for office automation equipment was more difficult than expected: 'We have been trying to find our strength in the market. We had a good zoom plain paper copier, but now everybody has the zoom copier. We couldn't follow up the engineering with sales.' In introducing new products and finding new clients, Minolta is facing similar problems to foreign companies trying to enter the Japanese market. 'One of the problems is that we can't really break through with major clients. The competitor's merchandise is already on the premises. It is difficult to convince any Japanese customer to change brands,' Mr Moro said. The reliance on foreign sales and, in particular, its high-profile in the US market prompted Minolta's quick settlement with Honeywell, though the speed of the deal surprised other Japanese camera equipment makers, about 15 of whom now face litigation. After a US court awarded Honeywell Dollars 96.35m in damages last month, the Japanese company had three options - accept the judgment, negotiate with Honeywell, or appeal. Mr Moro said the two companies began negotiations, and agreed on the Dollars 127.5m figure, which includes licensing fees. 'We thought of appealing, but it would take a lot of time and money. If we were not a manufacturer of high-publicity consumer goods, maybe we would think differently. We decided to lift this burden from our shoulders. Now we can look ahead.'</p>

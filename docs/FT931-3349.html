			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (26): The good, the bad and the crooked CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY by Tom Cannon Financial Times/Pitman Publishing, 277 pages, Pounds 30 A MORE promising book title might be 'Corporate Irresponsibility' given the potential cast of high-class villains from recent years: Maxwell, De Lorean and Peter Clowes to name but three. It would be wrong, however, to under-estimate the interest in Tom Cannon's more worthy subject. Business ethics, respect for the environment, even affirmative action to help the disadvantaged are important boardroom issues; they ought to feature prominently on any MBA course. It must be significant, moreover, that of the various sub-committees set up by a handful of the great and the good recently to map out the company of the future, virtually everyone wanted to be on the one concerned with corporate responsibility. Guilt perhaps? An eye for the publicity that often accompanies social and charitable projects sponsored by big companies? Not if you agree with Professor Cannon that corporate responsibility is much more fundamental, that it is an integral part of what he calls industry's 'economic contract with society'. The form of this contract, he argues, has varied over time and has been substantially redefined in the 1980s and early 1990s as the frontiers of the state have been rolled back. For lying behind trends such as privatisation and contracting-out is a developing consensus that private enterprise is relatively better able than the public sector to provide most economic and social needs. Cannon's proposition that management can deliver its side of the bargain - that the skills, knowledge and competence exist - is perhaps a touch generous. Certainly it is in companies' self interest successfully to do so  -otherwise their contract will presumably be renegotiated to their detriment by a future generation. But while the book is full of examples of outstanding companies it is also liberally sprinkled with examples of boardroom greed, corporate disregard for human health and safety, and abuse of the environment. Nor is the link between corporate responsibility and business performance - an underlying Cannon theme and an article of faith for many practitioners - altogether satisfactorily established. In view of their recent difficulties it is perhaps unfortunate that IBM - and even Mercedes Benz - are cited as business success stories with a good corporate responsibility record. The value of this well-documented book lies in its historical perspective: conflicts between industry and society go back centuries, for example, while the philosophical roots of today's good corporate citizens can be traced to the Victorian philanthropists and North American progressives (though generally there is not enough on the US); in its identification and coherent treatment of the relevant issues (from minority employment and boardroom pay to the moral dilemma of whether companies should support birth control programmes in the Third World); and in its enthusiastic advocacy of best practice. Professor Cannon may be shooting at a moving target but few can deny his conclusion that 'part of the contract between the manager, the corporation, and the community is an acceptance that neither office nor position give immunity from responsibility. Increasing numbers of corporate leaders recognise that a secure moral position, respect for the needs of others, business performance and enterprise quality go together.'</p>

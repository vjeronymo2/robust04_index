The plan, besides a ceasefire, calls for the resignations of  both President Rabbani and his rival Prime Minister Golboddin  Hekmatyar and the transfer of power to an interim council until  general elections can be held, said the official Associated  Press of Pakistan (APP).    The formula was presented to Pakistan Foreign Minister  Sardar  Assef Ahmed Ali Monday [24 Jan] by a representative delegation  of the Afghan Coordination Council which comprises factions  opposed to the year-old Rabbani government.    It groups Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party of  Afghanistan], Uzbek general Abdol Rashid Dostam's Jonbesh-e  Melli or National Movement, the National Liberation Front of  former president Sibghatullah Mojaddedi and a Shiite faction of  Hezb-e Wahdat [Islamic Unity Party].    During the meeting which lasted 90 minutes, the council  "responded positively" to a Pakistani proposal for a regional  conference on Afghanistan to resolve the crisis.    Pakistan wants Iran, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and the Central  Asian republics bordering Afghanistan to attend a regional  conference.    In a nationwide broadcast Sunday [23 Jan] Rabbani thanked  Pakistan, Iran and Saudi Arabia for their efforts to end the  three-week-old bloodshed in Kabul but said his forces would  fight on against Dostam's militia until they surrendered.    Rabbani said he was ready to give the Afghan people the  right  to choose a new leadership through elections or by convening a  traditional assembly of Afghan elders.</p>

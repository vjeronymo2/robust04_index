			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 24 Mar (MENA)--Informed Palestinian sources  have said that the current Palestinian-Israeli talks in Cairo to  implement the latest Security Council resolution on the  protection of the Palestinians in the occupied territories have  progressed.    The sources told MENA that the Palestinian-Israeli  subcommittee working to draft an agreement on the international  presence in Hebron, the Palestinian police force that will  deploy in the city, and the armament and jurisdiction of this  force has made progress and that the two sides are expected to  reach an agreement in the next few hours.    The sources added that the agreement will be tantamount to  an  "integrated package" that should be accepted or rejected as a  whole. The decision on whether to resume the talks on self-rule  in Gaza and Jericho will depend on this package.    The Palestinian sources said the agreement the subcommittee  is working on drafting will take into consideration the  Palestinian demands to move 42 Israeli families living in Hebron  city in the Qiryat Arba' settlement outside the city, because  their presence in Hebron causes tension.    The agreement also provides for instituting joint patrols of  Palestinian and Israeli police in Hebron to maintain security  and protect the Palestinians there.    The Palestinian sources believe the latest developments in  Hebron city over the past 48 hours assert beyond any doubt the  importance of adopting security measures to protect the  Palestinian population in the city in light of its unique  situation with Islamic holy places there.    The Palestinian sources stated that Israel has agreed to  international protection for the Palestinians through  international observers armed with light weapons. This is a  Norwegian proposal agreed upon by the Palestinian and Israeli  sides as a substitute for an Israeli proposal suggesting unarmed  international observers from the International Red Cross and  United Nations Relief and Works Agency personnel in the occupied  territories.    The sources noted that the Israeli Cabinet accepts the  Security Council resolution calling for international protection  for the Palestinian people in the occupied territories,  especially in Hebron city.</p>

			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / People: Prime movers give clout to Chinese exploration Sir Michael Palliser, 72, a former head of the British diplomatic service, has joined the board of the Exploration Company of Louisiana, a small loss-making US oil company which has been raising money in the London market. Sir Michael, vice chairman of Samuel Montagu, is a former director of BAT Industries, Bookers, Eagle Star, Shell and United Biscuits. Given his age, there is some surprise that he is taking on additional directorships. However, he is two years younger than Arthur Hummel, a former US ambassador to China, who has also joined the board. Henderson Crosthwaite, the UK brokers to the company, which has a substantial UK investor following, played down the age of the new directors. Exploration Company of Louisiana, which has until recently been exploring for oil and gas in the US Gulf coast area, has started looking for oil in China. It raised Dollars 25m earlier this year to help finance the drilling of three wells in the Zhao Dong block in China's Bohai Bay. The recruitment of a couple of well-connected septuagenarians is designed to give the company some boardroom clout in a part of the world where businessmen often do not reach their prime until they pass their 70th birthday. Sir Michael and Hummel join a board which already includes an ex-mayor of Houston and a descendant of the New Orleans banking family which invented Tabasco sauce.</p>

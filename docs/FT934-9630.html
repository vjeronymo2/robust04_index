			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Arafat upbeat on peace prospects MR Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, yesterday invoked the European Community as a model for securing peace and stability in the Middle East. On the second day of his visit to Brussels, Mr Arafat combined an upbeat assessment of the prospects for peace between Israel and her Arab neighbours with a fervent plea for financial and economic aid for the occupied territories, which he said needed more than Dollars 13bn for development and another Dollars 10bn in foreign investment until the year 2000. He held talks with the Belgian King and European Commission, and gave a speech to the foreign affairs committee of the Belgian parliament. Throughout, he was accorded the status of a head of state. Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, made clear that Brussels regards the newly created Palestine National Authority as a quasi-government in Jericho and Gaza, the two areas due to win local autonomy under an agreement with Israel. The PNA would be the European Union's chief interlocutor in the urgent task of channelling aid, he said. Mr Delors said European financial aid should be concentrated in three areas: infrastructure; creation of a Palestinian security force, and emergency food aid. Long-term plans for creating a zone of stability would have to wait. Mr Arafat was a model of self-control throughout an hour-long news conference until asked if the absence of his pistol suggested an effort to cultivate an image of peace. 'What will convince you if the agreement in Washington (with Israel) is not enough?' he cried. 'We have made a breakthrough. We are paying the price of peace with the price of our blood.' The PLO leader criticised 'extremists on both sides' for prolonging the Arab-Israel conflict. But he declined to support calls for an early lifting of the Arab boycott of Israel.</p>

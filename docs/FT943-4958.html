			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: Czech and Slovak fund offer to raise Dollars 25m The Czech and Slovak Investment Corporation, a London-based investment fund managed by merchant bankers Robert Fleming, is to raise Dollars 25m in a share and warrant offer to new and existing shareholders to finance further investment in the two countries. The offer, consisting of up to 340,000 units each including seven new shares and one new warrant, at a price of Dollars 73.50 a unit, is underwritten by Fleming and co-managed with SG Warburg. The offer closes on September 21. Current shareholders include the IBM Pension Fund, Robert Fleming, and Confederation Life of Canada. The fund, set up early last year, has invested Dollars 30m in the two countries. More than 90 per cent of the investments are in the Czech Republic. Mr Leonard Ingrams, the fund's chairman, said the proportion invested in Slovakia may rise, depending on the outcome of the Slovak general election at the end of this month. 'Things are happening there that we view positively but it depends on the election,' he said. The fund invests in a mixture of stock market-listed and unlisted shares and in joint ventures between international and local companies. Its portfolio, currently worth Dollars 35m, includes a stake in British Petroleum's recent Dollars 23m investment in a petrol retailing network in the Czech Republic. The BP joint venture is with two investment funds and is aimed at extending the UK group's network of petrol stations in the Czech Republic.</p>

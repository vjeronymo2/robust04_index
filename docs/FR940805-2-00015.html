S. Environmental Protection Agency, Superfund Records Center, 999 18th Street, 5th Floor, Denver, CO 80202-2405, 1-303-293-1807 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> DOE will prepare a SWEIS Implementation Plan after completion of the public scoping process. The SWEIS Implementation Plan will be placed in the public reading rooms for review, and copies will be made available to the public upon request. The Implementation Plan will be a brief document that will provide guidance for the preparation of the SWEIS in accordance with 10 CFR 1021.312 and will include a discussion of the intended scope and content of the SWEIS; a summary of the comments received and their disposition; and target dates for completion of the Draft SWEIS, Final SWEIS, and issuance of a Record of Decision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Preliminary Alternatives: This section describes three preliminary alternatives that represent the spectrum of options available for future actions at Rocky Flats. Each alternative represents a broad direction regarding materials management, waste management, and site cleanup that DOE could take during the ten-year period after the issuance of a Record of Decision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DOE recognizes that there may be a need to redefine these alternatives and welcomes comments on the best way to accomplish this. The actions DOE chooses to implement, through the Record of Decision, may be composites of actions analyzed in the SWEIS alternatives. Proposed future actions that are not well enough defined to be analyzed in the SWEIS will be subject to separate NEPA review tiered from the SWEIS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alternative 1_No Action: Analysis of the no action alternative provides a reference point for comparison with the environmental effects of the other alternatives analyzed. The No Action alternative would include ongoing activities and planned activities for which decisions have already been made to proceed. DOE will continue to conduct these activities as the SWEIS is being prepared.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ongoing activities included in the no action alternative are site cleanup and minor facility upgrades. Examples include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Transfer of non-nuclear weapons manufacturing to Kansas City <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Continuation of remediation under the Interagency Agreement <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Treatment and storage of onsite wastes up to currently approved limits <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Shipping wastes offsite to permitted disposal facilities that have agreed to accept the waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Maintenance activities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Activities needed to support ongoing site programs and to safeguard nuclear material <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DOE is also considering certain proposed actions for which NEPA review may be completed during the preparation of the SWEIS. DOE may decide to proceed with actions for which NEPA review has been completed and which are allowable as interim actions during the preparation of the SWEIS (see limitations stated in 40 CFR 1506.1, for example). These actions would then become a part of the No Action alternative. Such planned activities may include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Consolidation of fissile materials storage locations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Rehabilitation of site drainage ditches  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Actinide solution processing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Construction of a storage facility for investigation-derived material  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The no action alternative would not include cleanup activities and waste management activities that require new permits or facility upgrades that involve major expansions or modifications to existing buildings. Transfer of buildings or property to private ownership (economic conversion) would not be included in the no action alternative. Excluding these actions from this alternative provides the reference point that shows the effects of site operations with no major improvements or modifications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Analysis of the no action alternative is required by Council on Environmental Quality and DOE regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

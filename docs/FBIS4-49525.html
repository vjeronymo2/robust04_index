			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, may 7 (XINHUA) -- One experience  attributing to the achievements China has made over the past 15  years is that the government has always paid attention to the  correct handling of the relations between reform, development  and maintaining stability.    This was stated by Premier Li Peng at a meeting with Kenyan  President Daniel T. arap Moi here today.    Reform can be deepened and economic and social development  promoted only under the conditions of stability, Li said.    In the process of the reform, Li noted, the government  encourages the spirit of making bold explorations and summing up  experience constantly, and all reform measures should be tested  in practice. A measure will be persisted in and perfected so  long as it is beneficial to developing productivity, to  strengthening the comprehensive national power and to raising  the people's living standards, the premier added.    Since reform policies were carried out under the guidance of  the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics,  Li said, great changes have taken place in China. But there is  a long way to go before China becomes a strong and prosperous  country and dozens of years of more efforts are still needed, he  added.    During the meeting, Li told Arap Moi that the Chinese  Government attaches great importance to its relations with  Kenya. Thanks to the joint efforts, the relations have been  developing smoothly and will be consolidated and developed in  the future.    Li described Kenya as a country of important influence in  Africa, praising the Kenyan Government for its achievements in  safeguarding state sovereignty, maintaining national unity and  developing the national economy. China also appreciates Kenya's  foreign policy of non-alignment and keeping friendly relations  with its neighboring countries. The policy has contributed to  the stability in East Africa, Li said.    Arap Moi said that his visit to China has served to further  strengthen and develop bilateral relations, trade and economic  links in particular. The president also expressed agreement  with what Li Peng said that all countries should choose their  own roads of development in line with their own conditions.    Present at the meeting were Chen Changben, chairman of the  Chinese Government Reception Committee and vice-minister of  culture, Wang Changyi, assistant to the foreign minister, and  Chen Pingchu, Chinese ambassador to Kenya. On the Kenyan side  were S.K. Musyoka, minister of foreign affairs and international  cooperation, J.J. Kamotho, minister of education, K. Kones,  minister of state in the president's office, and P.L. Lotodo,  minister of home affairs and national heritage.    President arap Moi is to leave here this evening for India.</p>

			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Bosnian no-fly zone plan is agreed at UN THE United States, Britain and France have approved the main outlines of a UN draft resolution to ban Serbian combat flights in Bosnia, but with no immediate provision for enforcement, diplomats said last night. However, that could be the subject of a subsequent Security Council measure if the Serbs defy the ban. Favouring a two-tier approach, Britain and France are known to fear that the use of allied fighter aircraft to enforce a no-fly order could place UN peacekeeping troops at serious risk as they escorted humanitarian aid convoys. The UN force is soon to be greatly strengthened by the deployment of about 5,000 western European and Canadian soldiers. The western proposal calls for UN monitoring of the no-fly order. Reconnaissance aircraft could be used for that purpose. The question is expected to be taken up by the Security Council shortly, perhaps as early as tomorrow. In an effort to head off a UN resolution on a no-fly zone, Bosnian Serbs on Tuesday said they were prepared to suspend military flights over Bosnia. Militant Serbs warned that a no-fly order would prompt them to walk out of the Geneva peace talks. Diplomats appeared confident last night that Russia would go along with the draft and that China, while not supporting it, would not exercise its veto. India and Zimbabwe are expected to abstain. The draft resolution is the result of a US initiative following President George Bush's statement last Friday that Serbian raids showed 'flagrant disregard for human life'. Earlier, France had proposed UN action to bar Serbian combat flights in Bosnia. The Serbs are believed to have at least 20 combat aircraft in the country. Cluster bombs have been used to attack Moslem and Croatian positions. The US is expected to provide crucial intelligence and other support to the new UN forces due to be deployed to protect aid convoys in Bosnia, writes David White, Defence Correspondent. It is expected that US officers will join a headquarters operation drawn largely from the existing structure of Nato's Germany-based Northern Army Group. The main US contribution on the ground would be a field hospital, but it is thought Washington may also provide heavy airlift to help with the deployment. The move is significant both for the US, in committing even limited numbers of military personnel, and for the UN, in extending the scope of peacekeeping operations to include intelligence-gathering. US participation is understood to have been sealed despite initial French reservations. The force will be commanded by France's General Philippe Morillon, with Britain providing the largest number of troops.</p>

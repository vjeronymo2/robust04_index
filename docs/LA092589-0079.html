			<p><P> September 25, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> ISRAEL TOUTS HOUSING IN WEST BANK AS HAVEN FROM STRESS  </P> <P> Israel's Housing Ministry is asking Tel Aviv residents to consider moving to  the violence-torn occupied West Bank, site of a Palestinian uprising, for a  better life away from city pressures.  </P> <P> The ministry, headed by hard-line Second Vice Prime Minister David Levy of the  Likud Party, is offering special terms for about 200 homes at Jewish  settlements near Tel Aviv, where prices are high and land is scarce.  </P> <P> Ministry Director General Amos Ungar told Israel Radio that the settlements  offer "a better quality of life. It is still 5, 10, 15 minutes at the most from  Tel Aviv." He said houses are larger in the settlements.  </P> <P> "They will be able to enjoy the facilities of living not in the center of the  city but, so to speak, in the countryside," Ungar said.  </P> <P> About 70,000 Jews live in settlements in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip,  home to 1.7 million Palestinians waging a 21-month-old uprising against Israeli  rule.  </P></p>

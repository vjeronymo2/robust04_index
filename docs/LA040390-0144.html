			<p><P> April 3, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DANNEMEYER GOES AFTER FRANK IN LETTER  </P> <P> Rep. William E. Dannemeyer's campaign to expel Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) from  the House of Representatives because of Frank's relationship with a male  prostitute heated up Monday as Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) shot off a "Dear  Colleague" letter to the 435 members of the House.  </P> <P> The letter's two-page introduction is followed by 31 pages of attachments,  including Dannemeyer's legal analysis, highlights from articles about the Frank  case published in Penthouse magazine and elsewhere, and newspaper editorials  calling for Frank's resignation.  </P> <P> A Frank aide said Monday, "The vast majority of the material he (Dannemeyer) is  circulating is recycled untruth." He declined further comment.  </P> <P> However, Dannemeyer press secretary Paul Mero said, "This is all based on what  Barney Frank has admitted to. We don't have to take anybody else's word other  than Mr. Frank's."  </P> <P> Dannemeyer is perhaps the most vocal critic of homosexual rights in Congress  and one of its most conservative members. Frank, a liberal Democrat, is one of  two congressmen who has publicly acknowledged that he is homosexual.  </P> <P> In the letter, Dannemeyer argues that Frank should be expelled because he has  admitted committing sex acts that are crimes in the District of Columbia, that  Frank allowed the prostitute to operate out of his home, and that Frank engaged  in other dishonorable conduct. Frank has denied that he knew that the  prostitute, Steven Gobie, was operating an escort service out of Frank's home  in Washington.  </P> <P> Mero said Dannemeyer sent the letter Monday because the House Committee on  Standards of Official Conduct, which has been considering the Frank case for  months, is rumored to be close to a decision.  </P> <P> "We've been hearing rumblings that something is going to happen," Mero said.  </P> <P> Dannemeyer will move to expel Frank once the committee makes its report to the  House, perhaps as early as this week, Mero said.  </P> <P> Dannemeyer outlined his case against Frank in a letter to House members in part  because he is concerned that House leaders may block debate on his motion to  expel and move to table it without discussion, Mero said. A motion to table  requires a simple majority; a motion to expel a member requires a two-thirds  vote.  </P> <P> Frank's problems began last summer when he acknowledged to a Washington  newspaper that he had hired Gobie, with whom he had once had a sexual  relationship, as his personal assistant. Frank told the Washington Times that  his sexual relationship with Gobie ended after Gobie began working for him.  </P> <P> Frank has insisted that he paid Gobie's salary with personal funds and that  Gobie was never on the House payroll.  </P> <P> Frank himself asked the House ethics committee to investigate after the  newspaper story appeared.  </P></p>

			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Pledge to Irish talks by clergy NORTHERN Ireland's church leaders promised after a meeting with Mr John Major yesterday to take a lead in encouraging progress in the present 'round table' talks on the province's political future. Archbishop Robin Eames, the Church of Ireland primate, said the main Roman Catholic and Protestant churches wanted 'to be in the forefront of encouraging the political dialogue . . . now taking place and which we believe is the earnest desire of the vast majority of our people.' His call came as Unionist and nationalist political leaders completed another day of negotiations at Stormont, outside Belfast. Public comment was again limited to a brief agreed statement - probably a sign that the goodwill surround the deliberations remains largely intact. Four church leaders joined the prime minister in a meeting intended to show that Mr Major has put Northern Ireland high on his list of priorities. Besides archbishop Eames, he also met cardinal Cahal Daly, head of the Catholic Church in Ireland; Dr Rodney Sterritt, Presbyterian moderator; and the Rev Winston Good, Methodist president.</p>

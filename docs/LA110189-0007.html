			<p><P> November 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ISRAELIS DROP EFFORTS TO CRUSH ARAB TAX REVOLT  </P> <P> Israeli troops and tax officials withdrew from Beit Sahur on Tuesday, ending a  near-siege that failed to crush a tax revolt. For six weeks, they had  restricted access to Beit Sahur and confiscated household and industrial goods  from defiant residents.  </P> <P> The withdrawal ended one of the most unusual episodes of the Arab uprising.  Beit Sahur, a middle-class community of 12,000 people at the edge of Bethlehem,  was the first and only town in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip to protest  the occupation by resisting every form of Israeli taxation.  </P> <P> The protest enraged Israeli officials, and Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin vowed  to "teach them a lesson." Israeli authorities forbade outsiders to enter,  intercepted supplies of food, cut telephone lines, arrested dozens of tax  resisters and, most recently, threatened to freeze the bank accounts of all  residents.  </P> <P> Still, almost no one paid, despite raids on homes day and night and heated  debate within the community about whether it would not be better to work out  some sort of deal with the authorities. Complaints from church officials in  Jerusalem and from Pope John Paul II in Rome -- Beit Sahur is largely Christian  -- were mounting as the confrontation dragged on.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, as troops swept aside stone and sand roadblocks, residents  celebrated by chanting, "Israelis, out!" and singing the Palestinian anthem,  "My Homeland, My Homeland."  </P> <P> Privately, residents were cautious, aware that the blockade could be restored  at any time.  </P> <P> "I am happy," said Raji Qumsiyeh, an upholsterer who lost his living room and  dining room furniture and his television set to the tax men. "But the soldiers  could come back in two days or two weeks. We don't know."  </P> <P> The troops maintained a large encampment in fields next to the site where  Christians believe angels announced the birth of Christ. As they pulled out  Tuesday, a military communique announced that "tax collection and law and order  will continue . . . in the future as planned."  </P> <P> Army officials sought to put the best face on the decision to withdraw. They  said that $1.5 million worth of goods had been taken from more than 300  families, and they expressed satisfaction that no other town had taken up Beit  Sahur's cry of "no taxation without representation."  </P> <P> Brig. Gen. Shaike Erez, military governor of the West Bank, told Israel Radio  that he was "convinced the tax rebellion is broken."  </P> <P> The dispute put Israel in an awkward position. The troops were not dealing with  people throwing stones or gasoline bombs but with people who folded their arms  in passive resistance. And closing the town to outsiders recalled uncomfortable  images of the repression of Jews in Europe. During the tax raids, soldiers  tried to bar reporters, members of the Parliament and clergymen from entering  the town.  </P> <P> Israeli critics of the situation saw it not as a question of tax collection but  of authority.  </P> <P> "The nature of what happened was a contest over who is the sovereign in Beit  Sahur," commented Dedi Zucker, a leftist member of Parliament. "It hasn't been  proved that Israel is the real sovereign in Beit Sahur."  </P> <P> In the more than 22 months of the uprising against Israeli rule, Palestinians  have reduced their tax payments by an estimated 50% or more. Last spring, the  government curtailed health benefits and sought to justify the measure on  grounds that the Palestinians were withholding taxes.  </P> <P> Although Beit Sahur became something of a symbol abroad, it is not at all clear  that its example will be followed by others. As a matter of rebel policy, many  towns in the West Bank and Gaza Strip have decided that some taxes should be  paid in order to keep the struggling economy afloat.  </P> <P> In Nablus, considered the most militant of West Bank towns, factory owners and  farmers are encouraged to pay taxes to keep up employment and exports.  Exporters cannot send goods abroad without the permission of the Israeli  government.  </P> <P> In Bethlehem, many merchants pay taxes to keep the town open to tourists.  </P> <P> In Beit Sahur, there was a deep division, along generational lines, over the  wisdom of holding out. Mayor Hanna Atrash tried to negotiate a truce with the  military authorities so that residents would have time to reconsider. But young  activists held out for a total strike. They burned the car of a resident who  went to pay his taxes in an effort to keep soldiers from confiscating goods  from his pharmacy.  </P> <P> Activists in Gaza and Nablus were heard to grumble about the attention received  by the town for losing television sets and stereo equipment while elsewhere,  the toll of dead mounted daily at the hands of Israeli soldiers.  </P> <P> Other places are caught up in intra-Arab violence, with Palestinian militants  killing suspected collaborators. On Tuesday in the Khan Yunis refugee camp in  Gaza, masked youths hacked to death a nurse who worked at a local hospital. She  was accused of giving the names of wounded activists to Israeli agents.  </P> <P> Last week, five masked attackers stabbed a nurse to death at the same hospital.  They painted slogans on a wall accusing the victim of collaborating with  Israeli security forces.  </P> <P> More than 125 Palestinians have been killed by other Palestinians since the  uprising began. Israeli soldiers have killed about 600 Arabs.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> TOBACCO TAX CHANGE URGED  </P> <P> After being told that cigar smokers are placing their orders through the mail  to escape California's heavy new tax on tobacco products, the chairman of the  Joint Legislative Budget Committee said he wants the State Board of  Equalization to come up with "a fairer" tax. Sen. William Campbell (R-Hacienda  Heights) said he thinks the board, in interpreting Proposition 99, the tobacco  tax initiative approved by voters last November, has set the tax on selected  tobacco products so high that it will create a black market and drive  California tobacco shop owners out of business. He said he will draft a  legislative resolution asking the tax agency to reduce the new levy.  </P></p>

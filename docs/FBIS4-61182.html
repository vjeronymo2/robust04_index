			<p>BFN     [Text] On 3 May Islam Karimov, president of the Republic of  Uzbekistan, received Ukeru Magasaki, ambassador extraordinary  and plenipotentiary of Japan to our country. Noting the  prestigious position that Japan occupies in the world community,  Islam Karimov stated that firm mutual economic, trade, and  cultural ties have been established and contacts in all other  fields are developing successfully. Japan is a distant and very  much a legendary country for us; it has already stepped into the  21st century and is a leading power, the leader of Uzbekistan  told the ambassador. Japan is supplying companies worldwide  with modern technology and if mutual relations with Uzbekistan,  where there are stable conditions, a good climate, and rich  natural resources, become closer, then the development of such  economic cooperation will become even more beneficial for both  countries. Ukeru Magasaki thanked the president for the warm  reception and stressed that the newly formed Government of Japan  will strive further for the productive development of mutually  beneficial ties with Uzbekistan. Saidmukhtar Saidkasymov,  minister for foreign affairs of Uzbekistan, was present at the  meeting.</p>

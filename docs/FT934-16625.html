			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Survey of Distribution Services (4): Debate is renewed - Contracting out RECESSION and the resulting pressure on company costs have revived debate about the relative merits of in-house distribution versus contracting out such operations to third-party specialists. There have, for example, been suggestions that some large UK retailing groups - generally acknowledged as leaders in distribution systems development - might reverse the trend of the past 20 years and resume direct control of previously contracted-out distribution activities. Several distribution market surveys during the past two years have indicated disenchantment among some manufacturers and retailers over the performance of their contractors. As recession began to bite, some companies found themselves locked into contracts which gave their contractors inflation-linked cost increases at a time when their own turnover was declining. 'When things were going well, companies perhaps signed distribution contracts without looking as closely as they should have done at clauses on costs. With the general downturn in activity, some people began to wish they had considered those sort of points more thoroughly,' commented one leading UK logistics industry consultant. At the same time, the development of ever-more-sophisticated and reliable information technology (IT) systems increasingly enables manufacturers and retailers to exert tight control over areas of distribution activity where they now have plenty of experience. And that, it is suggested, is opening up new opportunities for companies to re-establish more in-house distribution management. Overall, though, the arguments for and against contracting out distribution remain finely balanced. That point was highlighted in a study of distribution issues published earlier this year by the commercial and distribution committee of the UK's Freight Transport Association. On the issue of costs, for example, the FTA study concluded that the operating cost of an effectively-managed in-house distribution operation was unlikely to differ much from one contracted out. 'It can be argued that a large contractor can use its purchasing power to secure more favourable terms for supplies of equipment, sites and consumables. In practice, however, many in-house operators are able to do better deals themselves,' said the report. 'A poorly-managed, inefficient in-house operation which perhaps has not taken advantage of the latest technology is a different matter. A contractor may be able to offer cost savings in this case. But these probably could have been secured by the in-house operator reorganising his own systems.' Generally, added the FTA report, the main motivation for a company contracting out its distribution was likely to be the benefit of the contractor's specialised distribution know-how. Contracting out distribution did not necessarily save money. The FTA's findings on the relative costs of in-house and contracted distribution activities are significant because that area is now widely regarded as the most important factor in many companies' approach to distribution. The point is reinforced by Mr John Stocker, group director business development for distribution company Ryder PLC. During the 1980s, he said, development of distribution systems was often all about supporting business growth and increasing service levels. 'Now, people still want service levels, of course, but the focus tends to be on how they can take out costs. There is a lot of benchmarking going on - and distribution is one of the areas people are looking at most keenly.' However, while such pressures are encouraging some companies to consider bringing distribution activities back in-house, demand for third-party specialist services is also growing. Ipswich-based contractor Russell Davies Distribution, for example, has over the past three years increased its annual turnover for UK contract distribution business from Pounds 2m to Pounds 19m and plans to double that by 1997. The end result as far as the overall distribution market is concerned is a continuing mixed picture. Most of the UK's leading supermarket groups, for example, are continuing to run some distribution activities in-house as an insurance policy and a benchmark with which to compare their contractors' performance. Mr Angus Clark, the director responsible for distribution and logistics for food retailer J Sainsbury, told a seminar organised by Exel Logistics earlier this year that he expected the distribution industry to continue developing in both directions. He pointed out that Homebase, Sainsbury's DIY subsidiary, was content to have warehouse and transport operations run on its behalf by Exel. For the supermarket business, though, the group operated some of the activity directly but outsourced most to third-party operators. 'We believe this combination gives us the advantage that we continue to source ourselves with experienced and professional distribution management,' he said. 'It makes research and development easier - both on methods and systems - if we have our own test beds. And it provides us with direct cost comparison to help us manage the contract operations successfully, and to feel satisfied about their performance.' One relatively new trend starting to become more apparent in the UK distribution sector is a return to favour of third-party common-user operations where two or more customers share the same facilities and services. The popularity of common-user systems declined during the 1980s as companies sought the service advantages of dedicated operations. But now, says Ryder's Mr Stocker, 'people are realising that there are economies of scale to be gained from shared user networks.'</p>

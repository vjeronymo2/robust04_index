			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Danish tax quashed by EC court THE European Court ruled yesterday that a Danish labour market tax on employers was illegal, confirming an earlier recommendation by the advocate general, writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen. The tax was introduced in 1987 to replace an employer social security tax levied on the total wage bill. The government scrapped the employers' social security contribution and introduced a tax levied on the company's total import bill and on value added in production for the domestic market. Exports were excluded from then tax. Import companies brought the case against the government, claiming that the tax was discriminatory and in conflict with the Treaty of Rome. Many companies are planning to withhold payment for the fourth quarter of last year, due on April 20, following the ruling.</p>

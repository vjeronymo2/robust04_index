			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> JUST ADD ELECTRICITY FOR TWINKLING ROOFTOP  </P> <P> Replacing burned-out bulbs and stringing miles of tangled Christmas lights up  stairways, over arches and around eaves is a holiday chore most homeowners can  do without. But Jerry Coziahr of Coronado has taken to doing it for a living.  </P> <P> Right up till Christmas Eve, Coziahr and her band of "elves" will scale tall  ladders and string lights around trees, poles and chimneys for homeowners who  either cannot climb ladders or detest the holiday ritual.  </P> <P> Coziahr, who has multiple sclerosis, is on medical leave from teaching  eighth-graders in the Sweetwater Union High School District until January to  try the business. Coziahr, 42, was found to have the disease seven years ago.  </P> <P> After 19 years of teaching physical education and family living, she gets a  little teary-eyed talking about the 13- and 14-year-olds she left behind.  </P> <P> "Students see me at the grocery store and ask me how I am and when I'm going to  come back to school," she said.  </P> <P> But dealing with 180 students a day fatigued her so much that her doctor  advised her to look for a different career, she said. With her business,  Coziahr can space appointments, meeting one or two people at a time, rather  than dealing with nearly 200 personalities a day, she said. Coziahr bought a  Dekra-Lite franchise in September to learn tricks such as how to make lights  stick to metal, stucco and wood. Coziahr and her 12 helpers have since  decorated about 40 homes and businesses in Coronado, Bonita and Chula Vista.  </P> <P> Some clients are wealthy and look at holiday decorating as just another  service, Coziahr said. Others are elderly and cannot climb ladders to put up  lights. But, in her first season in business, most of her clients have been  friends, she said with a laugh.  </P> <P> Coziahr, a single mother of two, said she does not expect to gross more than  $25,000 this season but hopes to increase her income each year. After school is  out, she will contact potential clients and plan for the holidays, she said.  </P> <P> "I'd like to keep doing it forever," she said.  </P> <P> Homeowners started calling after Thanksgiving, and installers have been  dispatched to as many as eight homes a day, she said.  </P> <P> Each job takes from two to five hours, and so far she has seen nothing but  smiles from her customers, she said. "It's really a fun business," she said.  "It's not a service I have to push people to buy."  </P> <P> The cost, which includes designing, installing and removing the Dekra-Lites,  has ranged from $165 for lights along the roof of a small home to more than  $1,000 for a home on a hill in Alpine whose owner wanted it lighted from all  sides, Coziahr said.  </P> <P> From a Chula Vista warehouse lined with bulbs and coils of lights in red  baskets, Coziahr coordinates the work of the designers and installers. They  include a college professor and a former commodities broker.  </P> <P> Most people just want lights on arches and in places they cannot reach, she  said. But design combinations, from twinkling white lights to strings shaped  like stars and Christmas trees, are almost endless, she said. "The idea anybody  can hang lights is true, until you look at the quality of the work," Coziahr  said. "One lady hired us because she didn't like the way her husband put the  lights on an outdoor tree."  </P> <P> Some people add lights after she is finished, but she doesn't mind. "I'm not  possessive about the design. I want people to be happy."  </P></p>

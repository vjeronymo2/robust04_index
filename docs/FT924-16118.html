			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Peaceful Angolan poll lifts hopes for African democracy ANGOLA'S National Electoral Commission extended voting in a handful of rural areas last night to give all registered voters a chance to make their choice in the war-shattered country's first free elections. 'By midnight we expect everybody who wants to vote will have voted and we expect the turnout to be at least 90 per cent,' said Mr Onofre dos Santos, commission chairman. The two-day ballot passed relatively smoothly, confounding widespread fears of violence and ballot-rigging. In an isolated incident last night a policeman guarding the house of the deputy minister of the interior was shot dead. Police said the gunmen were members of the opposition group Unita who believed the Luanda residence of Armindo Espirito Santo was being used to plot attacks on Unita leader Mr Jonas Savimbi. Earlier observers saw the success so far of the elections as offering hope for democracy elsewhere in Africa. 'It been a historic two days for the continent,' said one. 'If Angola can do it, with all the logistical and political problems, then the rest of Africa can do it too.' Mr Dos Santos said at least 2.5m people, about 60 per cent of the 4.86m registered voters, voted on the first day of polling. Logistical problems which delayed the establishment of about 400 polling stations on Tuesday had been overcome, he said, and it would be necessary to extend voting till late last night at only 40 stations of 5,800 across the country. Counting was under way last night and a result is expected this evening if an operation to fly electoral officers from remote areas to provincial centres continues smoothly. Diplomats and other observers praised Angolans and the election commission. 'There has been a tremendous enthusiasm to vote across the country which shows that Angolans want the new Angola to work,' said one observer. 'We've been amazed at the character of Angolans throughout ..the political awareness, tolerance, responsibility and gravitas about the historic moment.' The toughest test comes in the next 24 hours when one of the two main rivals, the MPLA government or the former rebels Unita, must accept defeat.</p>

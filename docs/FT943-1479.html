			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Prices at the Australian wool sales have declined for the first time this season. At Sydney and Adelaide earlier this week it became clear that the market had at last turned. The Eastern market indicator actually fell by 11 cents on Wednesday, marking a change of direction which is generally welcomed after the long rise in merino prices. A breathing-space would certainly be appreciated, although it is recognised that the strength in the international wool markets is still firmly based, and could reveal itself in higher prices again before long. One important factor in such a development would be a renewal of Chinese buying in volume when a lower price-level is established.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hindi </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nikhil Chakravarty: "Manmohan Singh's Economic </F> Policies and the New Economic Colonialism"]    [Text] The way the discussions in the Parliament were  changed adroitly into reverential praise for Manmohan Singh  after the tight control over the Joint Parliamentary Committee's  [JPC] report was issued, made one suspect that his resignation  was a drama staged to stop the attacks on his and his ministry's  liberal trade policies in the context of the Pratibhuti fraud  case. It was natural for one to hope that the government would  show some alertness and efforts would be made to save the nation  from negative outcomes of the open market policy. However, it  appears that the government has learned a very different lesson  after protecting it from the fire test of the Joint  Parliamentary Committee (JPC) questioning.    Here is one example. The announcement to transfer State Bank  chief G.B. Ramakrishna to Planning Commission was an open  submission of the finance ministry to the stock exchange  broker's demands. Why did this happen? It happened because these  brokers opposed Mr. Ramakrishna's efforts to control and  restrain the anarchy in trading and laundering black money in  the stock market. The warning given by Mr. Ramniwas Mirdha, the  head of the JPC, was accurate and timely. He had said that, "It  was important to implement strict guidelines while economic  reforms are carried out. Otherwise, there would be unlimited and  uncontrollable grief." He had made it clear that due to the lack  of monitoring system in the economic system, the open market  approach might result in something like the Pratibhuti fraud. We  need to remember the fact in this context that the JPC had  approved all the State Bank activities carried out under  Ramakrishna's leadership.    In this context, removal of Ramakrishna from the State Bank  gives birth to the fear that the government is giving us wrong  signals and that signal is that the government will try to  appease the brokers even at the cost of losing investments. This  is the pre-experience of these reforms that will be implemented  in economic and banking areas and about which the finance  minister and the prime minister had assured us in the Parliament.    Within one week after the debate on the JPC report in the  Parliament, the cabinet exposed another side of the Manmohan  Singh economics. He had assured six foreign investors that they  will make profits in electricity area. This has not been done  since the East India Company. At that time, arrangements were  made to make sure that the British investors make profit in the  British-owned railways system. No one has benefitted from such  an extraordinary exemption since then. This government action  will not only be called an act to remove all the hurdles faced  by foreign investors but will be counted as an exemption given  to foreign investors that was never made available to our own  industries.    This action clearly indicates a special preference for  foreign investments in the Manmohan Singh economics. This should  be called a major discrepancy in our country's economic  strategy. Under the present system, internationalization means  unequal treatment of foreign and Indian investments, and special  partisanship toward foreign investors. This bias in which  foreign investments are favored over internal investments can  definitely be called a new form of economic colonialism. The  economic reasoning given in support of this action cannot  deceive the people now. It is said that the government will be  more able to invest money in social programs with the foreign  investments. This argument is totally dishonest because the  assurance of profit given to the foreign investors will require  cutting development money from the state in question. First, the  foreign investors have been promised 16 percent profit and this  will be paid in dollars. Second, the electricity generated by  these foreign companies will not cost less then three rupees per  unit, which is three times more expensive than the one rupee  rate at present. It is clear that in order to make the promised  16 percent profit to the foreign investors, they will exploit  the state government on the one side and on the other side, the  consumers will have to bear the burden of 300 percent increase  in electricity price.    In the light of these facts, it is clear that the government  is avoiding telling the people the real meaning of government's  submission in front of the foreign companies. Any democratic  government is expected to present such a proposal for approval  at the legislative level as it calls for a major change in  policy. This main change is not about the question of open  market, but of giving special treatment to foreign investors.  These are special privileges which have not been provided to  internal investors. Heavy dependence on foreign debts is on one  side and assurance of profit to foreign investors is on the  other side. Do we need to do anything else to mortgage our  country's economic future? The JPC has clearly established that  foreign banks have played a decisive role in both the Pratibhuti  fraud and the stock market fraud. In such a situation, any  self-respecting government is expected to take action against  these foreign banks to stop their mischievous act. The finance  minister had also promised during the debate on the JPC report  in the House that he will not allow these banks to take away the  profits made in the Pratibhuti fraud case. However, the finance  ministry has not taken any concrete step to regulate the  activities of these foreign banks operating here. It would be  foolish to expect the finance ministry to take action against  the banks operating here because of its favorable leaning toward  these banks. Keeping in mind its leaning and its record, we can  expect it to support and defend the foreign banks at any cost.  The finance ministry under the leadership of Manmohan Singh has  set its mind to help the interests of foreign investors over  protecting our country's interests and self-respect.    In this atmosphere of derogatory and insulting submission to  foreign investors, the finance ministry has opened another area  to foreign investors through the Malhotra Commission report in  which privatization of insurance industry has been lauded. The  social goals inherent in nationalization of the Life Insurance  Corporation soon will be forgotten. After implementing this  plan, the next target of Dr. Manmohan Singh definitely will be  the banks. After privatization of these banks, the work of  driving another nail in the coffin of mixed economy will be  complete. At this rate, the railways should also be in the list  of privatization, and if this happens, the foreign investors  will be receiving a major award. If the public sector is facing  this fate, why should we deprive the maharajahs of their privy  purses?    During this time, some indications of the worries that our  economic system will cause have surfaced. The average rate of  industrial growth is stuck at 2 percent for the last three  years. This rate during the 80s was 8 or 9 percent. The rate of  growth of investment property is at the level of 12 percent.  There has been no significant increase in the earnings from  imports. The praise of our finance minister being lavished by  national and foreign investors cannot assure whether his  February budget will be welcomed warmly. It is possible that the  major investors will be given new tax incentives, but what will  be done for the masses who make the majority of our democracy?  If Manmohan Singh tries to implement his policy for which he has  expressed his commitment to the World Bank, he would be putting  the existence of this government in danger.</p>

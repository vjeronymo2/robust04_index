			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Retailers hit Food retailing stocks remained under pressure as fears of an impending price war continued to overhang the sector. Sentiment was further weakened when BZW removed the sector from its buy list to place it on hold. The fears were sparked by Tesco's comments on trials for lower regional pricing in parts of northern England. The sector's main casualty was J Sainsbury whose shares tumbled 19 to 397p, in trade of 5.7m. Argyll Group gave up 9 to 268p on the same worries while Tesco finished 6 1/2 lighter at 232 1/2 p. Kwik Save retreated 17 to 572p. British Gas was in the hunt as one of the FT-SE 100's worst performers as the shares retreated in the wake of a negative recommendation from one of the leading international broking houses. Nomura confirmed it had downgraded Gas from a buy to a hold after the stock had outperformed the all-share index by 14 per cent over the past three months. Mr Steve Turner, analyst at Nomura, said 'the historic yield premium of 50 per cent, against the market, would now seem to fairly reflect Gas's growth prospects.' At the close Gas shares were 7 1/2 lower at 299 1/2 p; turnover of 10m shares was the fourth highest in the FT-SE 100 list. The utilities sectors of the market were among the most volatile areas of the market after the utilities team at Hoare Govett, the stockbroker, advised its clients to switch from the 'recs' that have already embarked on a share-buy programme into the water stocks. Hoare's utilities team said: 'With the recs sector, having moved to an all-time relative high and with the close periods of the recs fast approaching, it seems appropriate to topslice.' Hoare recommended a switch from South Wales, down 5 at 803p, Northern, 11 off at 771p, and Manweb, down 5 at 818p into Severn Trent, a penny harder at 537p, Welsh, 3 up at 644p and Thames Water, marginally easier at 498p. A whiff of takeover speculation circulated in the insurance sectors of the market although dealers were hard pressed to pinpoint where the potential bid activity would be focused. Commercial Union settled 3 firmer at 498p, and General Accident put on 5 to 555p, while Royals edged up 3 to 273p and Sun Alliance 4 to 319p. Standard Chartered was a notable casualty in an otherwise strong banks sector, the shares said to have been affected by bearish stances adopted by Nomura and Hoare Govett. At the close Standard were 8 off at 256p. Lloyds Bank rose 10 to 540p after the Department of Trade gave the go-ahead for its merger with the Cheltenham and Gloucester Building Society. Inchcape moved up 12 to 410p following the announcement that its insurance broking business was in co-operation talks with Acordia of the US, number seven in the world insurance broking league. With some 2m shares changing hands, the stock shrugged aside persistent speculation about weak profits - and a possible dividend cut - when the company reports its interim results on Monday. Transport shares were active with British Airways hit by fare war worries, rebounding 7 to 373p and bus operator Go- Ahead moving up 6 to 132p following strong results and a takeover. Go-Ahead combined news of widening operating margins with the announcement that it was paying Pounds 20m - almost half of its stockmarket capitalisation - for London Central Bus. Eurotunnel eased 1 to 269p as rumours of renewed financing pressures began to circulate among analysts. A positive analysts visit to Rank Organisation's film and video operations on Thursday boosted the stock yesterday leaving the shares 12 ahead at 413p. The clutch of broker's recommendations for Granada Group made this week after discussions with analysts about the state of trading continued to support the shares. They added another 10 to 501p. Media shares managed a number of modest rebounds with Carlton Communications rising 14 in thin volume (1.4m trades) to 817p and Pearson group, heavily sold in recent days, gaining 12 to 567p. Reports of a buy recommendation from NatWest Securities helped Guinness shake off the gloom that followed Thursday's figures which came in at the bottom of market expectations. The shares advanced 3 to 451p.</p>

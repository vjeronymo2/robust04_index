			<p><P> January 8, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> JUSTICES RULE FOX LIABLE FOR FILM BLOCK-BOOKING  </P> <P> The Supreme Court declined to review a lower court ruling today that held 20th  Century Fox Film Corp. liable for a Fox employee's illegal block-booking of  movies such as "Cocoon" and "Prizzi's Honor."  </P> <P> The justices, without comment, rejected the film company's appeal in the  antitrust case.  </P> <P> At issue was whether a corporation can be charged with criminal contempt when  one of its employees is found in contempt for violating a court-approved  agreement.  </P> <P> Fox, in seeking high court review, argued that judges must consider any  evidence a corporation has showing it did all it could to make sure its  employees operate within the law.  </P> <P> The U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals found such evidence was irrelevant.  </P> <P> Fox and Leila Goldstein, manager of the film company's branch office for  Indianapolis, Milwaukee and Minneapolis, were convicted of criminal contempt  for violating a 1951 consent decree in which Fox and other motion picture  companies agreed to stop block-booking films. In the Fox case, Goldstein  required booking agents to take a less desired film in order to receive a  license for a more desired film.  </P> <P> For example, an independent agent was required to play "Black Widow" in order  to keep dates to play "Mannequin," and the same arrangement was required for  the film pairings of "Johnny Dangerously" and "Flamingo Kid" as well as  "Cocoon" and "Prizzi's Honor."  </P> <P> The government argued against review.  </P></p>

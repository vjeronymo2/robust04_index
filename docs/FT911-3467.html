			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: Five Mexicans face insider deal charges FIVE Mexicans were accused yesterday by the US Securities and Exchange Commission of profiting from inside information when buying shares in Anchor Glass, an American glass company bought by Vitro of Mexico in 1989. The five Mexicans include a former director of exports at Vitro, Mexico's largest industrial company, and a prominent investor Mr Ernesto Tinajero. According to the charges, the investors bought 150,000 shares of Anchor Glass for USDollars 1.7m. After the Vitro bid for Anchor Glass was announced the shares were sold netting the investors a profit of Dollars 1.2m. Insider trading is widely believed to be prevalent in the Mexican bourse, but Mexican authorities are much laxer than those in the US in enforcing rules against it. The Monterrey newspaper El Norte suggested that the Anchor Glass case should be a lesson for Mexican regulators.</p>

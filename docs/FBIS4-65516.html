			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Nicola Mancino, Italian Popular Party Senate </F> caucus leader, by Gianfranco Ballardin in Rome; date not given:  "Mancino: Not Now -- We Are Thinking in Terms of the Future..."]    [Text] Rome -- [Ballardin] Senator Mancino, have you in the  PPI [Italian Popular Party] already decided whether next  Wednesday [18 May], when the vote of confidence is taken, you  will vote against the Knight [Prime Minister Berlusconi  nickname]?    [Mancino] No, not yet. The party's leadership and the Senate  caucus will both be meeting today. After listening to its  policy statement, we will publish our overall assessment of the  government, both as regards its makeup (which is rather poor,  frankly speaking) and its platform's contents.    [Ballardin] Seven or eight PPI senators (among whom Grillo,  Delfino, Costa, and De Gaudenz) have already made it known that  they intend to be absent, when the vote of confidence is taken,  in order to ensure the government's viability.    [Mancino] I hope our 27 senators, as well as our 33  deputies,  will all vote the same way. How? We must decide this together  by Wednesday. But we must be an opposition party both in the  Chamber of Deputies and in the Senate.    [Ballardin] Are you prepared, however, to assume  responsibility for the government being defeated, which may  result in new general elections being called early?    [Mancino] I am aware that voters have pronounced themselves  in favor of a coalition which has a reasonable majority in the  Chamber of Deputies, but not in the Senate, where it must build  such a majority each time as need arises. So far, in the  Senate, the government coalition had luck on its side, both on  the occasion of the appointment of the Senate speaker, and when  it came to appointing the chairperson of Immunity Committee.  However, we do not have the duty to ensure governability. This  task falls to Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.    [Ballardin] In an interview with LA STAMPA, [former  Christian  Democratic Party, DC, Secretary] De Mita suggested the  following: We refuse our vote of confidence to the Knight, the  government is defeated, Berlusconi resigns, and he is replaced  by Berlusconi Two, who will negotiate with us before addressing  parliament. Have we correctly interpreted the meaning of the  former DC secretary's words?    [Mancino] No, he did not say "negotiate with us." He only  said that, at a later stage, the absence of a majority in the  Senate would become even more noticeable.    [Ballardin] Hence the PPI's decisive role.    [Mancino] A power over life and death.    [Ballardin] According to some, the Berlusconi Two option  suggested by De Mita looks like a mirage in the Sahara desert.  In your capacity as Senate floor leader, are you prepared to  instruct your fellow senators to vote against, at the risk of  having to go back to the polls?    [Mancino] Once upon a time nobody even dreamt of asking an  opposition party this kind of question. In any case, we cannot  be a mere appendage of the majority, and therefore we confirm  our role in opposition. As a matter of fact, we are currently  considering the best way of stating our position in the house.    [Ballardin] If I may ask, out of curiosity: Whom do you  prefer: Berlusconi, [National Alliance leader] Fini, or [League  Secretary] Bossi?    [Mancino] One of them, namely Bossi, is a territorialist,  and  therefore he favors the country's political fragmentation.  Next, Fini, in relation to us, the PPI, is poles apart. As  regards Berlusconi, he was chosen as the winning coalition's  leader not by us, but by the voters. Why should we question the  voters' decision?    [Ballardin] Some PPI members are saying: If Berlusconi  jettisons the fascists, it may be possible to reach an agreement  with him.    [Mancino] Undoubtedly, there is an alternative solution in  parliament. In fact, we might envisage a dialogue between AD  [Democratic Alliance], any willing Socialists, and the PPI.  Added to the League and Forza Italia, they could form a  majority, both in the Chamber of Deputies and in the Senate.  This, however, is not an immediate prospect, because Silvio  Berlusconi, having won the elections with a specific coalition,  is not in the position to make such a move, which, however,  could be considered by the parliamentary groups, acting  autonomously.    [Ballardin] Such a move, then, might become a real  possibility in the future.    [Mancino] Yes, we might work in that direction.</p>

			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Arts: Romeo and Juliet - Ballet WATCHING Irek Mukhamedov on Tuesday night in his debut as a Royal Ballet Romeo, we could see rather different qualities from those that had made his reading of the character so memorable with the Bolshoy. A consummate dance actor, he gave an emotional precision to the sweep of Grigorovich's dances, when the choreographic vision seemed to me somewhat generalised. With Kenneth MacMillan's creation, dramatic detail is part of the fabric of the role, and in exploring this very different approach, Mukhamedov was no less convincing, and moving. So, in the ball-room, we first see him still youthfully caught up in his infatuation for Rosaline (and Mukhamedov asserts, more clearly than any other Romeo I recall in MacMillan's opening scene, that it is an infatuation). But his attention turns towards Juliet as she embarks upon her solo, and we know the flare of his feelings. He is intrigued, then held by her beauty - he tells Mercutio of his fascination - and when at last the two young people gaze at each other, we see the lightning strike. The later progress of the scene, where MacMillan sets the interplay of a new love amid the social graces and social tensions of the ball, suggests the blaze (and the subterfuges) of illicit passion, which will explain all that follows. Mukhamedov plays this superbly well. Moments that have, with other interpreters, been lightly sketched, achieve a poignant intensity which reaches the heart of the character. The reading is ardent in everything, and ardently done. The action is fired throughout by Mukhamedov. He is not yet at ease with some of the dance: the lighter accents, the way the choreography makes fluid phrases, sit somewhat at odds with his heroic and physically dense manner. But he is everywhere Romeo, from the laughing youth of the first scene to the agonised man in the tomb whose handling of Juliet's body has a chilling verismo - we sense the weight of the supposed corpse, and the near hysteria of this Romeo's feelings for it. Yet it was in some ways a performance played in isolation. There seemed too little rapport between Mukhamedov and his Juliet, Viviana Durante. Miss Durante made an impressive debut in the role two years ago, but on this occasion her portrayal looked self-contained. That both artists can flame with mutual passion we know from Manon. On Tuesday, it was as if Miss Durante were applying brakes to Juliet's headlong race towards a great love, were holding herself back from Romeo. And impeccable as was the dancing, a Juliet who does not sweep us along on the inevitability of her love, is less than Juliet. There was a sound performance from the company, with Stephen Jefferies a tremendous Mercutio. He and Mukhamedov are cut, as artists, from the same cloth: there is no artifice to their playing, only drama vividly felt, vividly shown. The Royal Ballet season continues at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, until 8 August, with Romeo and Juliet alternating with La Bayadere</p>

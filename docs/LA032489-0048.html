			<p><P> March 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAFETY OF AIDS HOME TEST KITS STILL DOUBTED BY FDA  </P> <P> Federal health officials Thursday said that they remain skeptical about the  "safety and accuracy" of new home testing kits for detecting the AIDS virus and  said that the government must be cautious before approving their sale.  </P> <P> Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Frank E. Young, testifying before a  House subcommittee, said that a final decision has not been made on the home  testing kits. The FDA has rebuffed company requests to market the kits and  plans a public hearing on the issue next month.  </P> <P> But some manufacturers charged that the FDA was unfairly blocking their  marketing efforts by refusing to review their license applications for the  kits. They contended that the kits, by allowing maximum privacy, would  encourage testing more people for the virus.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Gathering More Information  </P> <P> Young said that the FDA is gathering more information on the kits and will ask  company representatives to address the health agency's concerns at an April 6  meeting.  </P> <P> "Caution at this time is prudent," Young said before the House Small Business  Committee's subcommittee on regulations, business opportunities and energy.  </P> <P> Young said that federal officials fear at-home AIDS test results would be  unreliable, both because the tests would be performed by untrained people and  because some people may not be able to follow the directions accurately.  "Nothing can substitute for well-qualified individuals using . . . effective  tests," he said.  </P> <P> Young said that further problems could result when blood samples drawn with the  kits were shipped to a laboratory for analysis. Delays in arrival of the sample  and exposure to temperature extremes could affect the results, he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Could Call Lab  </P> <P> After sending off their blood samples, those tested could call the lab about a  week later, identify themselves with a special code number and receive the  results.  </P> <P> Critics of the at-home tests said they are concerned that those testing  positive would not receive proper counseling. "Patients may quickly interpret  positive results as a virtual death warrant," said Rep. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the  subcommittee chairman.  </P> <P> "In the hands of the untrained, the unscrupulous and the insensitive, home AIDS  testing can inflict considerable human damage," Wyden said.  </P> <P> Elliot J. Millenson, president of Cross Industry Management of Rockville, Md.,  complained that the FDA has refused to review license applications for any  company developing home testing kits.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Feasible to Implement'  </P> <P> "The concept of home testing makes sense," Millenson said. "It is feasible to  implement, and the potential benefits appear to be far greater than potential  risks."  </P> <P> Millenson, whose company has developed a home testing kit, said that  professional counseling would be provided to people using the kit. But critics  said that the telephone counseling may be inadequate for a disease that is  fatal.  </P> <P> Young said the FDA, by adopting a cautious stance on home testing kits, does  not intend to discourage people from taking the AIDS virus test. With testing  now available at many clinics and other health facilities, "we're not robbing  people of access to tests," Young said.  </P></p>

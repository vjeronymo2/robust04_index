The  recession is over, the economy is thriving, jobs are being  created, and prices are relatively stable. NAFTA has been  approved by Congress, and the Uruguay Round has finally been  concluded. Initial agreements with the booming economies in  Asia are emerging, and Clinton's first visit to Europe was  generally praised, in spite of the war in Bosnia and the  insecurity regarding future developments in Russia.    Despite these successes and Clinton's considerable  popularity  among the U.S. population, things are not going well with his  presidency. His political credibility, which was never really  solid despite the approval, has become suspect because of the  so-called Whitewater affair. In fact, the White House legal  adviser who was mainly responsible for the amateurish handling  of this insignificant story dating back to Clinton's Arkansas  past has now left the stage. However, journalists have tasted  blood. A special public prosecutor is investigating the case,  and Congress is seriously considering hearings.    Behaving as though the Watergate scandal had never existed,  Clinton's advisers, out of a false sense of loyalty, assiduously  tried to protect the President and his wife Hillary with plump  maneuvers and delaying tactics instead of disclosing everything  at the very beginning and dispelling doubts and mistrust. With  this bunker mentality, which would have done credit to Nixon,  they succeeded in making a mountain out of a molehill. It is  not true that they enriched themselves personally or that public  funds were used for private or political purposes in connection  with the Whitewater investments and their deals with a bankrupt  savings bank. Clinton is a womanizer, but he is not greedy for  money, the well-known journalist David Broder stated on  television.    Thus, the inexpertness and foolishness with which Clinton  and  his advisers have handled the Whitewater issue since 1992,  creating the impression that they have something to hide, is all  the more inexplicable. Legal adviser Nussbaum played a  particularly inglorious role in this respect. Yet Hillary  Clinton, probably the president's wisest political adviser, also  failed in this case. The reason may be that Hillary Clinton,  who has thus far won friends and opponents with charm, expert  knowledge, and political finesse, is for the first time the  object of criticism. Clinton's wife is more deeply involved in  the Whitewater affair than the President himself, and faces the  danger of being discredited. She was not only responsible for  the investment decisions of the Clinton family. She was also  the lawyer for the savings bank in question, and she fiercely  rejected the nomination of a special public prosecutor who  should examine the Whitewater affair.    To make matters worse, her friends and colleagues from the  Rose Partnership in Little Rock, Arkansas, who have been given  positions in important government offices, have meanwhile gotten  into difficulties. Nussbaum had to resign. Vincent Foster, the  deputy legal adviser at the White House, committed suicide last  summer for unknown reasons, and Webster Hubell, one of the  deputies of the attorney general, is being investigated by his  former law office because of the alleged fraudulent settlement  of accounts.    It is quite obvious how this development, which overshadows  and which might even paralyze important legislative tasks,  including the health reform, was possible. Thirteen months  after Clinton took office, there is still nobody at the White  House who directs the destiny of the White House and controls  the apparatus with a firm hand, expert knowledge, and political  instinct. Mack McLarty, Clinton's friend and chief of staff, is  willing but weak. David Gergen, who already served President  Reagan as communications director, is more interested in his own  future than in Clinton's White House. All the other aides are  too young and inexperienced to be able to give good advice to  Clinton. Moreover, none of them has the required courage to  confront Clinton and his wife Hillary openly with unpleasant  things, Washington officials claim. What makes the situation  even more complicated is that the White House staff is serving  two presidents -- Bill and Hillary -- and has to divide its  loyalty between the two. Hillary's unprecedented powerful  position reportedly creates problems, too. William Kristol from  the "Project for the Republican Future" has offered another  explanation: Since Bill and Hillary have not learned to  distinguish between "public and private, and official and  personal matters," it is nearly impossible for aides to Bill and  Hillary to draw a clear line between ethically permissible and  unacceptable actions.</p>

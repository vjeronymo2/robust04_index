[Arenas] Good afternoon. Spanish Foreign Minister Solana  said when meeting Russian President Boris Yeltsin that Spain was  informed throughout about the attack by NATO aircraft on Serb  positions [in Bosnia-Herzegovina]. Then he said that the  situation in that region remains delicate and the possibility of  further allied attacks has not ended:    [Begin Solana recording] As you know, the situation is still  delicate right now. The possibility of there being more actions  has not ended, but I can tell you that our troops, the Spanish  troops, who are quite some way from Goradze, are also,  logically, on prealert. [end recording]    Solana also denied that Spain has decided not to offer any  more economic aid to Russia during Yeltsin's visit. He added  that they will be offered around $900 million in credit lines,  agreements, and investment.</p>

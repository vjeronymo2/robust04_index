			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Straw targets costs in council tax attack LABOUR launched its local election campaign yesterday, taking the battle to what is seen as traditionally Tory ground, with the claim that average council tax bills under Labour councils were Pounds 14 less than average bills under Tory councils. Mr Jack Straw, the shadow environment secretary, focused on the level of services provided by Labour county councils, high provision of nursery education and free home helps. 'The old Tory canard that Labour costs you more has gone. Labour costs you less and it is going to serve you better,' he said. The Tories retaliated swiftly, pointing out that Labour's figures were not an indication of relative efficiency or value for money. Instead, they said, the average figures reflected the fact that more properties in Labour areas were in lower bands, and would be bound to pay less than more highly-valued properties, since that was the basis of the council tax. The Tory campaign for the 47 county councils in England and Wales begins today, but electioneering has already spilled over into the Commons. Mr John Major, the prime minister, was attacked in the Commons by Labour over the way government grant is distributed among local councils. He retorted by reciting the 10 (Labour) councils charging the highest amounts for a particular band of property, and those (Tory or independent) charging the least. While Labour is the largest party in local government overall, it controls 13 county councils compared with the Tories' 19. Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour deputy leader, said the party would not step down anywhere to give Liberal Democrat candidates a clearer run. Local authorities must review their compulsory competitive tendering practices to make them more responsive to consumers, according to an Audit Commission report published today. The local government watchdog says some services that are contracted out are breaking down or of a poor standard. In a survey of 150 schools, a third expressed dissatisfaction with services such as cleaning and catering supplied by contractors. Realising the Benefits of Competition. Audit Commission. HMSO.

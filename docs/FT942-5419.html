			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / NatWest card error affects up to 60,000 customers Up to 60,000 people have been affected by a mistake in processing by National Westminster Bank, which led to Visa credit and debit card transactions for May 26 being put through its computer twice. The mistake, which involved millions of pounds of transactions, affected not just NatWest's own customers, but also those with Visa payment cards issued by other banks and building societies who used their cards at retail outlets which bank with NatWest. NatWest said yesterday that it had discovered the error on May 28, and that corrected entries dated May 31 would be appearing on statements. The correction was being backdated so that no customer would lose out financially, it said. The bank blamed the blunder, which arose when the same transactions were processed on two successive days, on human error rather than a computer failure. It said the whole system was being checked to make sure the mistake did not happen again. 'This is not a regular occurrence', a spokesman said. NatWest said that the small minority of customers whose monthly statements ended before the credit entry should deduct the duplicated amount from their bills, and should confirm this with their card issuer if they had any difficulties. This is not the first time NatWest has had problems with its processing. Last year, a human error in converting its Worldwide Fund for Nature Visa card accounts into ordinary Visa accounts meant that payments from some WWF card holders were credited to the accounts of other Visa card customers by mistake. On that occasion, the bank initially decided to adjust the accounts only of those individual customers who noticed a discrepancy and complained. Only after one customer had contacted a senior member of staff did NatWest contact and compensate the remaining card holders who were affected. In 1992, NatWest had to alert thousands of cardholders to errors after software was changed.</p>

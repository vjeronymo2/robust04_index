			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A great variety of comments were received in response to a question as to whether the current 9904.409&hyph;50(j)(1) cap on government recovery in the form of accumulated depreciation, should be also applied to gains and losses recognized subsequent to a revaluation of assets pursuant to a business combination. About half of the commenters believe that the current cap should be also applied to gains related to assets acquired in the course of a business combination. A significant number of other commenters believe, however, that no such cap should be applied in these circumstances. One commenter advocated a modified cap that would recognize the element of inflation in the gain. Another commenter stressed that the Government should share not only any gains, but also in any losses that may emerge. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Board has considered the merits of a cap adjusted for inflation. However, the actual calculations to establish such a modified cap seem to require establishment of a fairly complex and possibly cumbersome procedure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board agrees with the commenter who stated that the Government should participate in losses as well as in gains. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On the question as to whether the cap should be modified to take into account cost of money paid in the past, the views of commenters were clearly divided. The government commenters believed that there should be some accounting for past cost of money payments whereas all the other commenters did not think that any modification in the cap was warranted. However, most commenters recognized, that any attempt to modify the cap for cost of money would be complex and extremely difficult to compute in practice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Board agrees that any adequate process that could be developed to modify the current cap on government recovery for the past payments of cost of money would be complex and difficult to compute. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With respect to the conceptual argument as to who, the contractor or the Government should retain the ``gain'' due to inflation, there was no clear-cut agreement. In general, the government commenters stated that the government was entitled to any gain attributable to inflation on account of past cost of money payments. The industry commenters generally disagreed, although on a conceptual plane there were one or two exceptions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One industry commenter pointed out, once again, that if the Government wishes to share in the gain, it should be also willing to share in the losses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter stated that there should be no attempt to try to implement inflation accounting on a piecemeal basis. If it is to be done, then asset bases should also be revalued. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the overwhelming majority of the commenters indicated that whatever the arguments regarding the merit of recognizing inflationary gains, in practice the procedures needed to implement such inflationary adjustments would be so cumbersome and complex as to render the whole system unworkable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Board agrees with the commenters who state that the calculation of any inflationary adjustment would be a cumbersome and complex procedure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> When responding to the request in the SDP for suggestions regarding basis for allocation of gains or losses between government and contractors, virtually all of the commenters recognized the construction of an index or some other factor to reflect the historical usage of assets on CAS-covered work as contrasted with other work would be impractical and the costs involved would clearly exceed any possible benefits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Three comments suggested that, in any event, it would be contrary to the current CAS provisions to try to allocate the gain or loss on the basis of historical usage. They point out that current CAS 409, 415, and 416, in effect, use the current activity as the base for allocating adjustments related to the past cost measurements. Thus, these commenters maintain that a charge against the current period costs is all that is required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Three other commenters suggested that it may be possible to use a form of advance agreement that would establish, in conjunction with incurred cost settlements or submission, the ratio of CAS/non-CAS work at the indirect cost pool level. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It was also pointed out that no attempts at allocation should be undertaken when the contractor is essentially all CAS covered or all non-CAS covered, e.g., 85% or more in either category. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Board agrees with the commenters that it would be difficult to develop an equitable and reliable, as well as, economical basis for establishing the past usage of assets in CAS work as contrasted with non-CAS work. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Most commenters indicated that gains or losses attributable to misestimating of the residual value of assets transferred in a business combination should not be treated differently from other gains or losses attributable to assets transferred. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

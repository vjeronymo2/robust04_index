			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: BT3 Calculators will doubtless be working overtime in the investing institutions to gauge the retail demand for BT3. Since retail investors are said to have applied for at least 800m shares, against the 600m on offer, that implies the 1.4m or so applicants have applied for a minimum of 570 shares each. However, the public is unlikely to have applied for more than the 630 shares tendered for in BT2, since the first payment is much larger this time. All of which suggests that while the public has applied for more than 800m shares, the final total may not be much more than 900m. The 600m share institutional offer closes tomorrow and there seem to be bids for around 1.2bn shares. Those tenders are clustering around a 10p premium to the price on BT's fully paid shares, reflecting the time value of money. It would thus seem unlikely that the Treasury would increase the retail element to 800m and cut institutions back, since fund managers are paying a higher price, and small investors may also have bid for more shares than they expect to get. If these prove to be the final figures, the offer will count as a modest success. Whether the same can be said of the excessive hype and baffling advertising campaign is another matter.</p>

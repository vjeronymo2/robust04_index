			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / Letter: Free parliamentary vote on Maastricht the virtuous course Sir, Britain's prime minister need not risk his government's neck over the Maastricht treaty in order to deal with his Euro-rebels ('Tory Euro-rebels renew defiance over Maastricht', October 26) because he can achieve his ends in a much less dangerous manner. He should make a virtue out of the fact that parliament, and in particular his own party, much more accurately reflects the doubts of its electorate than does the legislature of virtually every other Community member state. He should propose a free vote not only on next week's 'paving debate' but also on the line-by-line consideration of the Maastricht bill. (This, of course, has the additional benefit of outflanking Labour's position.) In this way, he can give a powerful and popular impetus to the UK presidency by focusing (as he has already intimated) on the 'democratic deficit' and the absolutely critical need to address the concerns of the citizens of Europe. Brian H Gill, 261 Grove Street, London SE8 3PZ</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] The amount of credit given to businesses grew  vigorously in 1993, as we learned from the February report of  the Hungarian National Bank. The central bank estimates the  growth to be between 105 and 117 billion forints [Ft], which  corresponds to a 16-18 percent increase. As a comparison, in  1992, the amount of credits increased by Ft2.7 billion, i.e., by  0.4 percent.    In estimating the increase in the actual amount of credit,  the central bank took into consideration the cancellation of  debts, which led to a decrease in the amount of credit. The  cancellation of debts at the end of 1993 affected outstanding  amounts of Ft61.3 billion; according to preliminary data from  the banks, the effect on the decrease in the amount of credit  can be estimated to be Ft30-42 billion. As a result of debt  cancellation during the year, the amount of credit to businesses  decreased by Ft15.1 billion.    While the amount of current asset credits to businesses  decreased in 1992, in 1993 it increased by approximately 12  percent. However, the amount of investment credit decreased in  both years. The pace of the growth of foreign currency credits  to businesses slackened: While in 1992 the increase amounted to  Ft14.5 billion, in 1993 it amounted to only Ft4.5 billion. The  pace of the growth of small business loans was nearly the same  in the last two years. In 1992 the amount of credit increased by  Ft14.8 billion, while in 1993 it increased by Ft15.4 billion.    The amount of loans taken out by businesses directly from  abroad amounted to $1 billion, which increased gradually to $1.8  billion in the course of the year until September and remained  constant by the end of the year. According to year-end data, the  discrepancy in interest rates decreased. Although the decrease  in the discrepancy between the interest rates for credits which  would come due within the year and those which were taken out  this year, which began in May, came to a halt in the fall, it  continued in December, and as a result at the end of the year  the discrepancy between interest rates was the lowest since May  1992 (9 percent).</p>

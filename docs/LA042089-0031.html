			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> STILLWELL TO RESIGN BASEBALL POST AT MOORPARK COLLEGE  </P> <P> Ron Stillwell said Wednesday that he will resign as baseball coach at Moorpark  College effective at the end of the season. Stillwell, who has taught physical  education at Thousand Oaks High for 25 years, is in his fifth season at  Moorpark on a walk-on basis.  </P> <P> Stillwell, whose team is 20-13 overall and 9-7 in Western State Conference play  this season, said that he is resigning because maintaining the program without  being on the Moorpark campus full time has its drawbacks.  </P> <P> "It has been very difficult doing the job I would like to do as a walk-on  coach," Stillwell said. "I race from Thousand Oaks to Moorpark and arrive at  the ballpark 25 minutes before the first pitch. This is just a very stressful  and unsettling way to try and coach and I just can't do it anymore."  </P> <P> Stillwell plans to take a one-year leave of absence from teaching beginning  next fall and move with his wife Jan to Orlando, Fla., to work with his brother  in clothing sales. Kurt Stillwell, Ron and Jan's middle son, plays shortstop  for the Kansas City Royals, whose spring training site is in Baseball City,  Fla.  </P> <P> "At least I'll be able to see Kurt play baseball now," Stillwell said.  </P> <P> Said Moorpark second baseman Steve Sisco: "I was really disappointed. . . . I  went to Moorpark because I had heard good things about him."  </P></p>

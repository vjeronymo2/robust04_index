			<p><P> May 27, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INDIANAPOLIS 500;  </P> <P> HE FINALLY GAINS SPOTLIGHT, BUT STAYS IN RACE'S SHADOWS  </P> <P> Rich Vogler is one of those people who needed only 20 years to become an  overnight sensation.  </P> <P> Thanks to ESPN's new "Thursday Night Thunder" series, thousands of viewers have  discovered sprint car and midget auto racing -- and Vogler.  </P> <P> "I'll walk into a store somewhere and I'll hear girls mumbling, 'Is that him?  Isn't that Rich Vogler?' " he said.  </P> <P> Not surprising, since little has happened in those types of racing the last  decade or so that Vogler hasn't had a foot in. He has won the national  championship five times since 1978, and the 1980 national sprint car title as  well.  </P> <P> So, obviously, Indy car owners are stumbling over their checkbooks in their  haste to sign him up, right?  </P> <P> Well, no, they're not, this no longer being 1963. And Vogler, for all of his  winning, remains a 39-year-old midget-sprint car driver trying to, you should  excuse the expression, crash the big time.  </P> <P> Vogler will be racing here Sunday in the Indianapolis 500 -- he will be  starting 33rd, that's last, for the second straight year -- but he also started  Thursday night, in a sprint car show at Indianapolis Raceway Park, and Friday  night, in a race for championship dirt-track cars at the Indiana State  Fairgrounds.  </P> <P> So for Vogler, 500 or no 500, life goes on pretty much as usual.  </P> <P> But that doesn't mean he lacks a flair for the dramatic. This year, for the  second straight year, he made the field on the final day of qualifying after  bumping a former winner.  </P> <P> Last year, in a classic bit of high drama, it was Gordon Johncock who had to  step aside for Vogler, after he had earlier bumped Vogler's original car. This  year, Johnny Rutherford, who would have been starting his 25th consecutive race  here, was victimized by Vogler, who once again was driving a car he hadn't  intended to drive.  </P> <P> Vogler, a bit of a traditionalist, wishes that Rutherford could be driving here  Sunday, too, but. . .  </P> <P> "That's just the way life is," Vogler said. "I didn't go out there with the  idea of knocking J.R. out. I just went out to try to get in."  </P> <P> Besides, nobody has to remind him how unfair racing can sometimes be.  </P> <P> "It seems like all my racing career, I've been setting records of all types,"  he said. "Maybe it's written somewhere that I'm supposed to start the most  times here in the last row. This is three times in my five starts."  </P> <P> But he is starting, and even that's a bit of an upset. When his own car came  down with a severe attack of enginitis last Sunday, crew chief Mark Bridges put  him in teammate Kevin Cogan's backup machine, a 1988 March with a Cosworth  engine, at the last minute and wished him well.  </P> <P> "The job he did was great," Bridges said. "He had virtually no time in the car.  I told him to go out and get a feel for it, to go easy the first couple of  (qualifying) laps but he said, 'No, I'm ready.' He wanted to go right out and  qualify.  </P> <P> "I thought that was a bad decision but he did it and he was real calm about it.  Calm and steady, real relaxed.  </P> <P> "There are a lot of race car drivers and then there are guys who drive race  cars. He's in that category."  </P> <P> Which brings up the question, once more: If Vogler's so good, why isn't he  driving for one of the big-time teams?  </P> <P> If it were still 1963, he probably would be, for in those days the progression  for drivers was from midgets to sprint cars to Indy cars. A.J. Foyt, Parnelli  Jones, Jim Hurtubise, almost everyone drove sprinters and midgets to Indy.  </P> <P> But in the mid-'60s, the rear-engine revolution cast a new light on things.  Suddenly, previously scorned road racers -- "sporty car drivers" -- were being  courted, thanks to their experience in rear-engine cars.  </P> <P> And in the late '70s, when Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART) replaced the  United States Auto Club (USAC) as the sanctioning body for all Indy car racing  except the 500 here, the trend went from oval-track racing to road and street  racing, another blow to oval-track drivers.  </P> <P> This year, for instance, of the 14 CART-sanctioned events, only five are track  races.  </P> <P> That means that although an oval-track veteran might come in handy for  Indianapolis and the few other track races, hiring him for an entire season of  predominantly road races is not viewed as a prudent business decision.  </P> <P> Vogler, who cut his teeth on oval-track racing, first in three-quarter midgets  as a youngster, switching to the real thing when he was 19, simply got caught  in the switches.  </P> <P> "I happened to come around (the Speedway) just about the time the Indy series  turned," he said. "I was brought up around oval-track racing, midgets. My dad  had one before I was even born. We never went to a road race of any sort."  </P> <P> None of which means that Vogler wouldn't like a shot at turning right, as well  as left.  </P> <P> "I got to make a buck and that's what I do when I win a midget race or a sprint  car race," he said. "But if I could take off a couple of years and just go  Super V racing, Formula Ford racing or something like that to get the road  racing experience, (I would)," Vogler said.  </P> <P> But, of course, even that probably wouldn't be enough.  </P> <P> "I haven't taken off work to hang around the Indy car races and be at the right  place at the right time," he said.  </P> <P> "The Indy car series, you do have to go there with a pretty good sponsor and  that's the way you get the sponsors, be at the right party and have the right  guy take a liking to you, or the right company, thinking they can use you.  </P> <P> "With me racing 80 times a year, trying to make a buck, I really don't have  time to do that."  </P> <P> So, most likely, Vogler will go on being a short-track star who nibbles around  the edges of the big time, driving here and, he hopes, in the 500s at Michigan  and Pocono.  </P> <P> But there is a goal here he wants to accomplish. Although he has started four  times here, he has never finished, crashing three times -- 2 1/2 times through  no fault of his own, he said -- and retiring with mechanical problems the other  time.  </P> <P> "I know if I finish, I'll be up toward the front," he said. "Last year I was  running fifth or sixth and I know if I could have finished, I would have been  up there.  </P> <P> "My expectation is to make it through the first lap -- that's the first thing  -- and then finish the race."  </P> <P> Then he can pack the family into the motor home and head out for a sprint car  race. Surely there will be one somewhere on Monday.  </P></p>

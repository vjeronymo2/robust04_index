			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Plans row threatens lift-truck producer THE FUTURE of UK manufacturing at Lancer Boss Group, the biggest British-owned lift-truck producer, is at stake because of a green-belt planning row that came to a head yesterday. Boss workers at Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire, where the company has manufactured lift trucks since 1959, are worried that objections to a plan to build a manufacturing plant in the town might force the company to relocate manufacturing overseas. That would threaten 300 direct UK manufacturing jobs and most of the 400 jobs at Leighton Buzzard indirectly linked to manufacturing, such as those in design and production support. Worse still, the company says, 500 new manufacturing jobs, which would be created progressively as the new plant increased production of high-volume models, would be at risk. Sir Neville Bowman-Shaw, chairman of Boss and co-owner with his brother Mr Trevor Bowman-Shaw, is hoping that the appointment of Mr Michael Heseltine as president of the Board of Trade might tilt the balance towards industry and employment. Meanwhile, Mr Simon Valence, senior shop steward at the GMB general union, said the general union had invited Mr Heseltine to visit the site. Boss manufactures at six sites in Leighton Buzzard, involving time-consuming transfers of components which, it estimates, may cost as much as half the profit on each lift truck. In 1990, because of the success of the lift trucks produced in the UK and the need for efficient volume production in highly competitive world markets, Boss announced a plan to consolidate manufacturing operations on one site. The plan has received local planning permission, and includes a new 13-acre town park outside the proposed 37,000 sq metre manufacturing site. The new plant would encroach on the green belt by 95 metres. After objections from Friends of the Earth and a local preservation society, an inquiry called by the Department of the Environment found that Boss had not searched hard enough for an alternative site. Boss was given until yesterday to submit a new review of alternatives, but the review still concludes that no alternative is available that fits management and financial criteria. A final decision from the department is not expected until the autumn. The Leighton Buzzard factories lost Pounds 2.75m last year, and the company wants to resolve its future quickly - both to avoid being caught out again by lack of capacity when market conditions improve, and to respond to the present shake-out in the lift-truck industry.</p>

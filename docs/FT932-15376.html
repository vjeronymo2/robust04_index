			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Printers doubtful about recovery THERE are no signs of any real recovery in the British printing industry, according to the quarterly survey by the British Printing Industries Federation. Only 10 per cent of its sample of companies enjoyed an improvement in their trading conditions between mid-December and mid-March, compared with 34 per cent who had expected them to be better. The survey says: 'There have been too many false dawns and withered green shoots to allow printers to be positively cheerful. Companies are chary too, simply because they can detect little in the way of real confidence among their customers or in the economy at large.' The federation survey concludes that most printers are prepared to believe the worst of the recession is behind them. It adds: 'They hope but are less than confident that recovery is under way and sure that, even if the economy is improving, it is doing so slowly and unevenly.' A total of 68 per cent of companies thought the printing business would improve over the next three months compared with 24 per cent which thought it would stay the same and 8 per cent which thought it would grow worse. More than half the printing industry has cut its workforce over the past three months and a quarter expect further reductions up to June. The report adds: 'Recruitment is at a standstill in larger companies and confined to a minority among small and medium-sized printers.' Even with the reduction in the workforce 84 per cent of the industry is still suffering from surplus capacity, compared with 73 per cent in December. But the survey found smaller and medium-sized firms happier with their order books than larger ones with half reporting them to be normal or better than normal.</p>

			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Election 1992: Leader makes bad connection on call-in MR NEIL KINNOCK left an upbeat news conference on the National Health Service yesterday to find himself firmly contradicted on Labour's plans to halt GP fundholding and hospital trusts by NHS employees, Ivo Dawnay writes. Two callers on the BBC's Election Call phone-in programme articulately rejected his prescriptions and insisted that Tory reforms were improving patient care. Mr Kinnock, after a campaign in which he has rarely been wrong-footed by the press, was later discomfited by a woman trade unionist from Bridgwater in Somerset. Ms Yvonne Anthony questioned Mr Kinnock on the impact of Labour's proposals for a minimum wage. She claimed the measure would lead to leapfrogging pay claims and the loss of jobs. Mr Kinnock countered by saying that fears of job losses as a consequence of equal-pay legislation had not come to fruition. 'No, Mr Kinnock,' she replied, 'I actually worked for a company at that time that made 25 per cent of its female workforce redundant.' Earlier, the Labour leader had returned the NHS to the centre of the party's election campaign at its penultimate news conference - suitably attended by a group of hospital nurses. Arguing that the future of the service lay at the 'heart' of the election, he said Labour was appealing to the electorate to give it a democratic mandate to save and develop the NHS.</p>

The third extra budget, endorsed at a cabinet meeting  for introduction to the Diet next Tuesday, lifts the scale of  the entire general-account budget for the current year ending in  March to 77,437.50 billion yen.    The initial fiscal 1993 budget earmarked 72,354.8 billion  yen.    Spending for public works projects was revised upward by  1,920.1 billion yen to cover a larger part of the largest-ever  15.25 trillion yen package released by the government Tuesday to  turn around the ailing economy.    The extra budget also calls for additional outlays of 82.1  billion yen to help salvage struggling small companies.    A sum of 143.8 billion yen was additionally budgeted to make  up for possible losses among farmers after Japan opens its rice  market.    On the other hand, 10.8 billion yen was cut off the planned  expenditures.    The spending increases under the extra budget will be  financed by 2,182 billion yen in proceeds from construction bond  issuance and 3.2 billion yen in nontax revenues.    The cabinet also approved an increase of 844.9 billion yen  under the government's fiscal investment and loan program for  fiscal 1993.</p>

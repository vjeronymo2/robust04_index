Mubarak al-Fadil al-Mahdi, official in charge of the Ummah  Party's external action, criticized the delegation's statements  that he is in Nairobi for the sake of "sabotage and distortion"  with a view to thwarting the negotiations sponsored by IGADD  [Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and Development]  members. He expects the negotiations to fail.    In a statement, a copy of which AL-HAYAH has received,  Mubarak al-Mahdi stressed that contacts are continuing between  the party and "our brothers in southern Sudan, first and  foremost Colonel John Garang, leader of the Sudanese People's  Liberation Movement [SPLM]. He also said: "We have always  worked and called for stopping the devastating war in south and  east Sudan and for stopping the massacres and ugly human rights  violations committed in the name of the jihad by the Khartoum  government throughout Sudan (...), and the government must stop  the ongoing fighting immediately, instead of shedding crocodile  tears over peace." He added: "We are not exploiting this dirty  war in our struggle to topple the government of the Islamic  Front and restore democracy in Sudan, because its fuel is our  people on both sides and its victims are women and children  (...). We are capable of settling our battle with the regime in  Khartoum, as we have besieged it politically and socially. It  is now besieged by failure and corruption."    He accused the government and "its party, the Islamic Front  party" of aborting the "peace plan achieved by al-Sadiq  al-Mahdi's government in 1989," and of choosing the military  solution and making millions homeless. He said that the  government "has not achieved any significant victory," pointing  out that the "SPLM still controls 90 percent of the southern  territory. And the Islamic Front has reaped nothing except the  demand for self-determination, which it planted and fed by its  alliance with Lam Akol and its agreements with the al-Nasir  group in Frankfurt and the Netherlands." He said that the Front  decided to participate in the peace negotiations after "its  summer military campaign failed." And it alone is responsible  for the death of thousands of victims and for the soldiers,  officers, and Popular Defense troops scattered in the southern  territory, west of the Nile, and who are dying of starvation."    He expects the Nairobi negotiations to fail, "because the  National [Islamic] Front is offering Garang and southerners  peace in return for symbolic participation in a dictatorial,  tyrannical regime that is isolated and condemned internationally  for committing the ugliest of human rights violations." He  wondered: "What benefit will southerners gain from that?"</p>

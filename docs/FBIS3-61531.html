To this end, the dynamics of the  specific glial proteins and antibodies to them in the blood of  patients after neurosurgery are studied. To this end, 23  patients divided into two groups--14 with a verified brain tumor  (principal group) and 9 in the control group--aged 35 to 45 are  examined. The anesthetic procedure and research methodology are  outlined. Brain _a_[.sub]1[/]- and  _a_[.sub]2[/]-globulines, _a_[.sub]2[/]-glycoproteid,  gliofibrillary antigen, and antibodies to them were examined;  the number of neurospecific proteins and autoantibodies to them  were determined by immunoferent methods and recorded by a  multispectral Titerteck Multiskan spectrophotometer (by Flow,  U.K.). Statistical data are processed using the  Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney nonparametric criteria. The neurospecific  protein concentration in the blood of the principal and control  groups against the background of anaesthesia and during the  postoperative period is summarized. A high neurospecific protein  level is measured in the blood of most of the principal group  patients during the preoperative period; it is speculated that  the antiendematic drugs used before the surgery facilitated an  increase in the hematoencephalic barrier permeability. Similar  results were obtained in the control group. The conclusion is  drawn that anaesthesia is the leading factor affecting an  increase in the hematoencephalic barrier permeability to  neurospecific proteins in the bloodbrain direction whereby  the neurospecific protein dynamics make it possible to speculate  that the glial protein synthesis is enhanced under the effect of  anaesthesia. It cannot be ruled out that a massive neurospecific  protein influx into biological fluids against the backdrop of  dehydrating therapy, alcohol intake, neurolepsy, and traumatic  brain injury generate the protective response preventing the  autoimmune brain impairment.

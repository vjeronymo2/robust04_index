			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Improved margins boost Carclo - Arthur Lee acquisition should be earnings enhancing in first year CARCLO Engineering increased profits and earnings by 55 per cent last year, helped by the devaluation of sterling and improved demand in the UK. Mr John Ewart, chairman, said high gross margins on its products meant that the increase in sales led to an immediate rise in bottom line profits. Pre-tax profits in the year to March 31 rose from Pounds 5.63m to Pounds 8.75m on sales up 7 per cent at Pounds 84.4m. The 1991-92 results were held back by a Pounds 1.17m exceptional charge. Earnings per share rose from 9.6p to 14.9p and a recommended final dividend of 3.4p raises the total by 10 per cent to an 8.6p. On May 11 Carclo announced the agreed takeover of Arthur Lee, the Sheffield-based maker of steel and plastics products, in which it already had a 29.9 per cent stake. Lee yesterday reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.3m (Pounds 600,000) in the half year to March 31 on sales of Pounds 42m (Pounds 51.9m). The interim dividend is 4p (1.65p). Mr Ewart said the Pounds 55m acquisition of Arthur Lee would lead to savings by bringing together the two companies' wire rope and steel purchasing interests. There would also be savings at Lee's head office. The acquisition should be earnings enhancing in the first year. Mr Ewart said sales from the card clothing division had increased with increased demand from mills and original equipment manufacturers. Operating profits rose from Pounds 2.06m to Pounds 3.2m on sales up 27 per cent at Pounds 20.5m. Profits from the general engineering division rose from Pounds 1.98m to Pounds 2.62m on sales up slightly at Pounds 24m, helped by the control cable business and the bronze and aluminium component maker. The wire division's profits rose 41 per cent to Pounds 1.9m on sales almost unchanged and the group expects this area to be a significant beneficiary of the merger. Carclo said yesterday that its offer for Arthur Lee had been accepted by holders of 21.7m shares, representing 91.7 per cent of Lee's capital. The remaining shares would be compulsorily purchased. Carclo shares rose 10p to close at 224p.</p>

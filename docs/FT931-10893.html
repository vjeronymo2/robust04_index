			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / UK Company News: TR City net assets improve Net asset value per share of the TR City of London Trust stood at 125.69p at the end of December. That compared with 112.8p at the June 1992 year-end and with 109.55p 12 months earlier. Available revenue for the half year to December 31 slipped from Pounds 4.42m to Pounds 3.92m, equal to earnings of 2.01p (2.28p) per share. The fall was blamed on lower interest received, dividend cuts and an increase in the bias of dividends accrued towards the second half. The board confirmed its intention to maintain the full year dividend at 4.76p.</p>

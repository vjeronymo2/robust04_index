			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Difficult second quarter at Parkland Parkland Group, the woollen yarn and worsted cloth maker, saw pre-tax profits fall from Pounds 970,000 to Pounds 950,000 in the six months to September 2, after a difficult second quarter. However, profits on continuing operations, after taking account of the sale of its interest in Company Image, improved by 7 per cent to Pounds 1.02m. Mr Denis Greenwood, chairman, said the second quarter was characterised by late contracting from many large customers and longer term concerns about raw material price pressures. 'Although this very demanding trading environment still prevails in many of our markets, order levels and production have improved substantially in recent weeks,' he added. Parkland also announced that it was paying Pounds 110,000 in shares to acquire Firthmill, a textile importer. In addition, Pounds 40,000 loans to the vendors will be repaid on completion. Turnover fell from Pounds 29.3m to Pounds 25.8m, including Pounds 1.35m (Pounds 3.8m) from discontinued operations. Earnings per share were 10.2p (10.3p) and the interim dividend is held at 2p.</p>

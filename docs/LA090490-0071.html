			<p><P> September 4, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IBM, HITACHI TO JOINTLY MARKET SOFTWARE  </P> <P> Japan's Hitachi Ltd. and International Business Machines Corp., once bitter  adversaries in a copyright battle, have joined forces to develop financial  management and marketing computer software, Hitachi said Monday.  </P> <P> "This is the beginning of broader cooperation," said a spokeswoman for IBM  Japan, a subsidiary of the Armonk, N.Y.-based computer maker.  </P> <P> Cooperation between the two computer giants is of greater marketing than  technological significance, industry analysts said.  </P> <P> The pact between IBM and Hitachi is in marked contrast to the mood seven years  ago, when a San Francisco court ordered Hitachi to pay an undisclosed sum after  IBM accused Hitachi of industrial spying and copyright infringement.  </P> <P> The new agreement will build on recent efforts by both companies to create a  standard software operating system. The programs will be based on the Open  Software Foundation's version of the Unix operating system.  </P></p>

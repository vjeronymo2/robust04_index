			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Armin Pfahl-Traughber article: "Republikaner in First </F> Place"]    [Text] Whereas in France there is an extremist right-wing  party in the shape of the National Front, which includes the  majority of French extreme right-wing factions, in Germany the  extremist right-wing landscape contains fissures. Ideological  and strategic differences, internal jostling for power, and  personal grudges created a split that, as time went by, created  mutual obstacles in extreme right-wing party politics. An  example of this effect is illustrated by the 19 September 1993  Hamburg municipal elections, where although extreme right-wing  parties together gained a total of 7.6 percent of the votes,  they failed to reach the 5-percent threshold on account of their  competing candidacies, and thus failed to gain seats on the  municipal council. The following survey permits a view of the  development of the extreme right-wing political landscape.    Without doubt the most significant extreme right-wing party  today are the Republikaner, founded in 1983 as a right-wing  Christian Social Union [CSU] faction, or "right of center"  party, by the two former Bundestag deputies Franz Handlos and  Eckhard Voight and the former television reporter Franz  Schoenhuber. In subsequent years, there were hefty internal  disputes among the Republikaner, caused by differences of  opinion about the party's orientation. Whereas Handlos wanted  the Republikaner to be a conservative alternative to the CSU,  Schoenhuber wanted to orient the party in a similar direction to  the French Front National. In the end, Schoenhuber had his way,  which resulted in former activists from traditional extreme  right-wing organizations joining the Republikaner and taking  over leading Republikaner posts, for example Harald Neubauer.    This political orientation also found increasingly clearer  expression in the party's programs and publicity. Adjustments  to these were made later, but they were dictated not by a wish  to revise contents, but by tactical needs. Thus, Schoenhuber  described a softening of tone in the program as a "verbal  revision." The Republikaner want to appear as a serious party  that is faithful to the constitution, said Schoenhuber. That is  the only way they can have an influence on broad public opinion,  according to him.  <H5>  Against Foreigners </H5>   Since then, the Republikaner have avoided making extremist  right-wing statements, which does not mean that they never make  them. For instance, Schoenhuber approves of the Mussolini  regime's economic policies between 1926 and 1930, and for his  deputy Rolf Schlierer "the political distinction between friend  and foe" is a typical structural element of extremist doctrine.  In view of such views, the statements of senior Republikaner  functionaries who have left the party's ranks come as no  surprise. For example, former Republikaner general manager  Centa Hirsch said that Schoenhuber does not want to turn the  party into a modern right-conservative party, and that "instead  of pursuing a path of overcoming violence," he stirs up  aggression against foreigners with his public appearances.    But normally, leader Republikaner functionaries proceed more  carefully and formulate their political positions in such a way  that they do not appear extremely right wing at first glance,  but are capable of being interpreted that way. This tactical  concession has nothing to do with an acceptance of the  democratic principles of a law-governed country. Even the  exclusion from the Republikaner of the group of former members  of traditional right-wing extremist parties whom Schoenhuber  himself invited to join the Republikaner is no indication of  such an acceptance, this exclusion being a mere strategic option  dictated by internal power struggles. In the 10 years of the  Republikaner's existence, a total of 10 groups have broken away  from the party to form parties of their own.    In elections, support for the Republikaner has been  fluctuating all the time. The party received 3 percent of the  votes in the 1986 Bavarian Landtag elections, viewed as a  "relative election success," but was unable to maintain this  support in subsequent elections and received about 1 percent of  the votes thereafter. Not until the elections to the Berlin  Chamber of Deputies and the 1989 European elections did the  party receive a surprising 7.5 percent and 7.1 percent of the  votes respectively, which, needless to say, was followed by  another ebb in support, with the party receiving only 2.1  percent of the vote in the 1990 Bundestag elections.    According to their own figures, the Republikaner have 24,000  members. Even so, the party lacks a sufficient personal and  organizational basis for its political activity, something which  appears rather obvious when one views its parliamentary activity.    In terms of political significance in the right-wing camp,  the German People's Union [DVU] is in second place. It was  founded in 1971 as an association, and was converted to a party  in 1987. Between those two years its chairman, the Munich  publisher Gerhard Frey, tried to establish a readership within  the DVU of his extremist right-wing newspapers such as the  DEUTSCHE NATIONALZEITUNG. When it appeared that election  mandates might be quite profitable, Frey made a daring move and  entered the world of (election) politics.    In 1987, the DVU ran for the Bremen municipal elections with  a massive publicity campaign, and received 3.4 percent of the  votes. This result was followed by further successes in the  north, 6.2 percent of the votes in the 1991 Bremen Landtag  elections and 6.3 percent in the Schlewsig-Holstein elections.  In most of the other elections, the party tended to suffer  defeat, for instance at the 1989 Europe vote, where it only  received 1.2 percent.  <H5>  The DVU Incapable of Action </H5>   The DVU claims to have 26,000 members, but it has even less  of a functioning structure than the Republikaner because it  consists mostly of passive members. Even inside the Bundestag  the DVU has completely inexperienced and incompetent deputies  who receive their instructions from party headquarters in  Munich. Individual DVU fractions have disintegrated relatively  quickly on account of internal disputes, so that continuous  parliamentary activity is also impossible for this reason. The  DVU's ability to act depends almost exclusively on one factor --  its chairman's finances. Programatically, the DVU has virtually  nothing to say. The program consists of a single A4 sheet of  paper with 12 vague points.    The National Democratic Party of Germany [NPD], the oldest  extremist right-wing party, forced in 1964, also possesses  little more significance in its own political camp. It was  incapable of following on from its elections successes in the  second half of the 1960's, and achieved only sporadic low-level  election successes, for example 2.1 percent of the votes at the  1988 Baden-Wuerttemberg Landtag elections. As a result of the  decades of defeat, more and more activists quit the NPD as time  went by, so that today the NPD is one of the few extremist  right-wing groups that does not claim to have any popularity.  The NPD claims to have only 5,000 members left. The exodus of  members is encouraged by the policies of its chairman, Guenther  Deckert, who wants to gear the party to traditional political  concepts and harbors unofficial contacts with neo-Nazi activists.  <H5>  The German League </H5>   Many ex-NPD officials organized themselves into yet another  extremist right-wing party, the German League for People and  Homeland [DL], in 1991. The DL's declared purpose was to cement  together the disintegrated political landscape. Relatively  well-known former officials from the above-mentioned parties  joined the DL within a short period of time, but the DL's actual  objective was never reached. On the contrary, the DL's  existence has led to a further disintegration of the extreme  right-wing political landscape. The DL is represented in the  European Parliament by Republikaner deputies, but with its 800  members and completely nonexistent party structures, except in a  few regional centers, it is of hardly any significance  whatsoever.    In addition, there are a few neo-Nazi formations that  possess  party statutes, such as the Free Workers Party of Germany [FAD],  but have been classified as pressure groups on account of their  own view of themselves.  <H5>  No Unity </H5>   Despite their similarity, the extreme right-wing  organizations do not form a united political bloc. The personal  grudges of their chairmen, each party's insistence on its own  independence, and ideological and strategic differences have  supposedly prevented these organizations from gathering within a  single bloc. In any case, the era of opposing election blocs of  extremist right-wing parties seems to be over, as suggested by  the results of the Hamburg elections. In Hamburg, the  Republikaner succeeded for the first time in outstripping their  election competitors on their own territory. The DVU was  incapable of making any impression in these elections because it  lacks a functioning party structure and because it is  permanently geared to the role of an election party. The NPD,  DL, and FAD are of no significance in any case. In the future,  the extremist right-wing vote could go to the Republikaner.</p>

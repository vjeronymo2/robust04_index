"Hungary is returning to Europe. Although the EU is  primarily based on common economic interests, the Hungarian  Government is expecting the membership status to increase the  country's security," Boross said. "In the long run, EU  membership will eliminate the reason for concerns over the  situation of Hungarian communities beyond the border, too," he  added.    The prime minister said that borders would become passable  in  the Europe of regions, neighboring peoples would be connected  more directly, and the common European law would guarantee  minority rights.    Asked whether a referendum was intended to precede the  admission, Boross said it would be due only after the issue  getting on the EU agenda. Negotiations are expected to start in  1997, and there is a chance for full membership in 1999 or the  year 2000.    The current situation is favorable for submitting the bid,  Boross said, because the EU states have just ratified the  Maastricht treaty and can now turn to the new applicants.    "We have been assured of Hungary's favorable prospects. It  would be a mistake to miss this historical opportunity," Boross  said, asking Parliament to authorize the government to make this  step.</p>

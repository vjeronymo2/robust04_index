			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Wang Bixue (3769 3024 1331) and </F> XINHUA reporter Zhang Yinshu (1728 6892 2562)]    [Text] 26 Mar, Beijing (XINHUA) -- At a national meeting  on discipline inspection in procuratorial organs today, Zhang  Siqing, procurator general of the Supreme People's  Procuratorate, pointed out: Procuratorial organs are an  important force in the anticorruption struggle. They are also  one of the departments designated by the central authorities as  being of importance to the anticorruption struggle. To correct  others, we must correct ourselves first. Procuratorial organs  at all levels in the country must fight corruption in their own  system and purify the procuratorial ranks to more effectively  fulfill their roles in law supervision.    Zhang Siqing said: Procuratorial personnel are warriors at  the frontline of the anticorruption fight, but they are also  important targets which corrupt criminal elements try to win  over to their side and corrode. From problems that have been  exposed so far, we can see that only a small minority of the  procuratorial ranks has violated the law and discipline.  However, this fact has a very bad effect on the masses. It  seriously ruins the image of procuratorial organs and damages  the sanctity of the state legal system. Some procuratorial  personnel have used their procuratorial authority to obtain  personal gain or wantonly used their authority to infringe on  the rights and interests of citizens, such as by using it to  practice favoritism and commit fraud, to demand and receive  bribes, and to leak classified information on cases which are  being handled, and by wantonly using it to illegally detain  people and extort confession by torturing people. These are the  main manifestations of corrupt phenomena in procuratorial  organs. We should focus on strictly investigating and dealing  with these cases, which involve acts that violate law and  disturb discipline. We must never connive with or tolerate such  acts; nor should we cover up those acts or shield their  perpetrators.    It has been made known that last year, while they were  vigorously investigating and dealing with major and important  cases involving corruption and bribery, the procuratorial organs  focused on fighting corruption in their own system and scored a  certain degree of success. Since August 1993, procuratorial  organs at all levels have been comparing themselves to what is  stipulated in provisions on honesty and self-discipline in order  to investigate and correct themselves. At the same time, they  have strictly investigated and dealt with cases involving  procuratiorial organs and personnel who violated the law and  discipline. They investigated and dealt with 568 personnel who  violated the law or discipline, and they sorted out 24 types of  fees and fines which were arbitrary collected or imposed within  the procuratorial system.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A by-election was held in Rustavi yesterday. Last  night, speaking on Georgian TV, Besik Jalaghania, chairman of  the Rustavi Electoral Commission, said the elections went  smoothly and without hindrance until noon. At that time armed  units appeared in town, who, according to Jalaghania, tried to  exert pressure on voters and members of the Electoral  Commission. It became impossible to continue the voting  procedure in some polling stations.    According to Jalaghania members of the Mkhedrioni  [paramilitary units united under the Georgian Rescue Corps] were  among those causing the destabilization. The Mkhedrioni press  center circulated a report that the organization had nothing in  common with any of the candidates. Therefore, the small units  acting in Rustavi yesterday did it on their own initiative.    Jalaghania also said that because of the disturbances he had  to quit the elections and get away from Rustavi. He thinks that  the by-election in Rustavi may be considered void.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 21 KYODO -- North Korea has told the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that it will allow  inspectors to monitor the exchange of fuel rods at its  5,000-kilowatt nuclear reactor at the Yongbyon nuclear site, the  Korean Broadcasting System (KBS) reported Thursday [21 April].    Pyongyang, in a telegram sent Wednesday to the UN nuclear  watchdog, said it will exchange the fuel rods at the reactor  soon and permit IAEA inspectors to monitor the process,  according to KBS.    North Korea, however, stopped short of mentioning the  possibility of complying with nuclear safeguard obligations by  accepting additional inspections of its nuclear installations by  the IAEA, KBS said.    The IAEA is reportedly expected to convey its position on  the  North Korean offer at an early date, the report said.    KBS said that the North Korean proposal seems to aim at  breaking the nuclear impasse by making a counterproposal at a  time when they are obligated to allow additional international  inspections of the radiochemical laboratory.    U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry told a press conference  Thursday that North Korea is close to removing the spent fuel  from the 5,000-kilowatt nuclear reactor, enabling it to extract  enough plutonium to make four or five nuclear bombs.    Perry pointed to the need to monitor the removal of the  fuel,  saying, ``We believe it is critical that this operation is  supervised by the International Atomic Energy Agency.''    A six-member IAEA inspection team went to North Korea in  early March but was denied access to the radiochemical  laboratory. The agency said the tests it wanted to carry out at  the laboratory were necessary to determine whether Pyongyang has  diverted nuclear materials.    The IAEA referred the matter on March 22 to the UN Security  Council, which issued a presidential statement on March 31  urging North Korea to allow the nuclear watchdog to complete the  inspections.    North Korea denies western assertions that it is developing  a  nuclear arsenal, but refuses to allow international inspectors  into some of its nuclear facilities.</p>

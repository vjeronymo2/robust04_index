			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / 'Men's club' still proves exclusive: The difficulties women face in reaching the top in management FOR MRS Sara Morrison, a long-standing board member of General Electric Company and one of the participants in the Institute of Management survey on female managers published today, advance notice of the report's findings have made depressing reading. 'I'm surprised so many of the old barriers still loom so large,' she says, referring to the main conclusion that the single biggest obstacle seen by women to female progress at work was the continued existence of the 'men's club' network. Prejudice by colleagues was the second most commonly experienced barrier. The results do not match her personal experience, she says, expressing her astonishment that many of the attitudes described in the report had not died out in the 1950s. 'But it's jolly difficult to argue against the findings, given the number of people in the survey,' she says. The fact that 51 per cent of the nation's brainpower is not being properly exploited is bad news for women, but 'much more serious, it's bad news for UK Limited'. Later this month, Opportunity 2000, the employer-led initiative that covers more than 20 per cent of the workforce, will report on its first year of operation. It will be interesting to note whether organisations have made any headway in the past 12 months in tackling fundamental prejudices, or whether they have stuck principally to improving the more obvious practical conditions surrounding, for example, career breaks and part-time working in junior grades. There is a danger, the institute points out, that 'focusing on tangible ways of allowing women to combine a family with a traditional management role obscures the real debate'. It adds: 'If creche facilities and flexible working are the whole answer, why do so many women still fall behind their male counterparts at the early stages of a management career - even before they have family responsibilities?' Prejudice among colleagues is not restricted to men, the report discloses. While 18 per cent of men in the survey said they would, or did, find it difficult to work for a woman, 12 per cent of women made the same confession. Only two thirds of women felt they received adequate respect from male superiors, and the figure remained well under three quarters even when it came to getting respect from female superiors. Some women observed what has sometimes been described as the 'queen bee' syndrome. Said one: 'Women who make it to the top do not help or mentor others to do likewise.' For one senior woman in the City, Ms Anne McMeehan, managing director of Framlington Unit Management, respect is gained, regardless of sex, if 'you're clearly good at your job, provided you're not dealing with blinkered or bigoted individuals'. Does she ever come across such individuals? 'Yes, but of both sexes,' she says. Women could also be their own worst enemies because they often undervalue themselves, according to Ms Kathleen Wood, headteacher of Pimlico Comprehensive School, London and a participant in the survey. 'At interviews you still do see women who feel the need to justify their ability to run a home and a career,' she says. They emphasise that they have the agreement of their partners in applying for the job. 'You wouldn't hear men say that,' she says. By endlessly justifying themselves, such women end up 'raising doubts in people's minds'. Perhaps the most thought-provoking of the report's findings is that female managers are significantly less likely than their male counterparts to be married or have children and are more likely to be divorced. Ninety-two per cent of the men in the sample were married while 32 per cent of the women were unmarried. The reasons for the findings were not explored in the questionnaire. It is possible, the report observes, that some women had made a deliberate choice at an early stage, and that that choice had in itself made it easier for them to follow a management career. It is also possible that, faced with the practical difficulties of combining the two, many have elected for a career over children. The institute says: 'If the choice is a deliberate one for many, the findings seem to show that in the current cor-porate climate women are justified in making it if they do want to reach the top. Of the women managers who have had children, half say that caring has adversely affected their career. Similarly, 39 per cent of those who had taken a break to care for children had returned to work at a lower level.' However, the report concludes that a deliberate choice of career or family - a dilemma not presented to men - 'is not a realistic or sustainable solution for the majority of women looking for a career in management'.

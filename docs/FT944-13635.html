			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Aitken was fourth minister in cabinet inquiry Mr Jonathan Aitken, Treasury chief secretary, identified himself last night as the fourth minister investigated in an inquiry by Sir Robin Butler, cabinet secretary, into allegations of impropriety. In a Treasury statement, Mr Aitken said he had 'never been guilty of any impropriety in the conduct of any of my responsibilities as a minister or MP'. He said he had never met Mr Mohamed Fayed, the owner of Harrods, 'or had any dealings with him or anyone acting on his behalf'. Downing Street said no other ministers were involved in the inquiry, established by Mr John Major to investigate allegations made by an unnamed intermediary allegedly acting for Mr Fayed. Mr Aitken's statement followed a similar acknowledgement by Mr Michael Howard, home secretary. Both were cleared of all impropriety. Downing Street refuses to disclose the allegations or to name the informant. In an effort to draw a line under the allegations of impropriety that have dogged the government, Mr Major will today announce details of a standing committee being set up to draw up standards for public life. Mr Major, who had 45 minutes of talks at Downing Street last night with Lord Nolan, the committee chairman, is expected to appoint eight to ten prominent people. The prime minister will also announce a replacement for Mr Neil Hamilton, the former corporate affairs minister, who was dismissed on Tuesday after Mr Major said fresh allegations had been made against him. Mr Hamilton was cleared by Sir Robin of earlier allegations that he had accepted payment to place parliamentary questions. Mr Tim Smith, the other minister investigated by Sir Robin, resigned last week after admitting accepting payment. Amid continuing unease among Tory right-wingers about the sacking of Mr Hamilton, Labour sought to exploit the government's discomfort by demanding full details of the charges against him. Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow trade and industry secretary, told Mr Major in a letter: 'It is essential that MPs and the general public are told the whole truth, and not just presented with a parody of open government. 'Adding to the government's discomfort, Mr Fayed said Mr Major's Commons statement, which amounted to a claim that he had tried to blackmail the government, was based on hearsay evidence. Mrs Barbara Mills, the director of public prosecutions, disclosed that a note summarising a conversation between Mr Major and the alleged intermediary of Mr Fayed on September 29 was not passed to her office until last Thursday. That was the day on which The Guardian published allegations that Mr Hamilton and Mr Smith accepted payment from Mr Fayed for asking Commons questions. As Downing Street steadfastly refused to shed further light on the remaining charges against Mr Hamilton, further details emerged from friends of the former minister. They said he was confronted with an allegation that he had failed to disclose a consultancy with Mobil Oil and a separate allegation about his relationship with Plateau Mining. The government was also said to have received an anonymous letter alleging that Mr Hamilton had avoided paying taxes. The friends said Mr Hamilton was 'dismayed' by the prime minister's treatment of him, but was not planning a bitter Commons resignation speech. He expects to return to the government after disproving all the allegations. Some of the allegations may be considered by the Commons privileges committee. Labour MPs, who walked out after the Tory majority decided to sit in secret, appear willing to return if some sessions are held in public. Negotiations between Labour and Mr Tony Newton, the committee chairman, have so far failed to produce a deal. The implausible guardian of morals Page 10</p>

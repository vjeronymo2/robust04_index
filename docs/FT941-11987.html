			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / International Company News: Nabisco slumps to Dollars 496m net deficit RJR Nabisco, the US cigarette and food group, continued to show the effects of the price war in its domestic cigarette market by slumping into net losses of Dollars 496m for the fourth quarter. Last week, Philip Morris, RJR Nabisco's biggest rival, reported a 72 per cent fall in fourth-quarter net profits to Dollars 339m. Both companies have suffered from price cuts introduced last year in a bid to regain US market share - though prices have started to creep back up. A large part of the losses were caused by a Dollars 467m charge for restructuring and the results were in line with expectations. The shares closed unchanged at Dollars 7 1/2 . The Dollars 496m loss compared with a net profit of Dollars 37m last time. RJR Nabisco said both figures included unusual charges, which if stripped out, would have resulted in a fourth-quarter net profit of Dollars 38m, compared with Dollars 207m in the comparable period. RJR Nabisco reported yesterday that fourth-quarter cigarette sales volumes were down 9 per cent in the US compared with the previous year, and lower prices reduced the value of sales by 26 per cent. The result was a 72 per cent fall in the division's operating profits to Dollars 130m. International tobacco sales were up 25 per cent, due in part to Russia and the Middle East, and operating profits rose by 10 per cent to Dollars 158m. Nabisco Foods saw a 12 per cent increase in worldwide sales and lifted operating profits by 16 per cent to Dollars 308m. In December, RJR Nabisco announced it was cutting 6,000 jobs from its workforce of 63,000. Although this hit 1993 profits, it said it would enhance future net earnings by Dollars 250m a year. Fourth-quarter losses per share, fully diluted and including all charges, were 35 cents, compared with earnings of 4 cents last time. For the full year, turnover fell to Dollars 15.1bn from Dollars 15.7bn and net profits of Dollars 299m turned into net losses of Dollars 145m - though the company said if unusual charges were stripped out, the figures would have shown net profits of Dollars 464m, compared with profits of Dollars 812m last time. Losses per share, fully diluted and including all charges, were 12 cents compared with earnings of 24 cents last time.</p>

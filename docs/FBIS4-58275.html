[passage omitted]    At the rally, Prime Minister Mahmud al-Zu'bi delivered a  speech on behalf of President Hafiz al-Asad in which he stressed  that the Syrian working class is celebrating 1 May with  confidence and optimism and with a clear and comprehensive  vision of the future. He said:    [Begin al-Zu'bi recording] Brothers, it is my pleasure and  privilege to represent President Hafiz al-Asad [applause] at  this celebration and to convey to you the greetings of our  leader, who devoted himself and his efforts to his people and  his nation. He carried Syria's aspirations and the Arabs' issues  on his strong and solid shoulders. He gave the workers and all  the producers in this homeland most of his attention and support.    I also convey to you the president's congratulations on this  great day, along with his wishes that are full of love and  confidence, confidence that the innovative and productive human  being will continue to be the basic pillar of any society  aspiring for growth and development as well as confidence that  people armed with national and pan-Arab awareness alone can see  their way through all circumstances, events, and changes. They  are the force that can overcome obstacles and challenge dangers.  People who are armed with national and pan-Arab awareness can  raise the edifice and work to increase production. They are the  ones who make out of their self dependency and potential a  launching pad to embody their will, strengthen their unity,  reinforce their cause, promote their prestige, and confront  challenges, no matter what form they take at any time. [end  recording]    Al-Zu'bi spoke, in general, about the features of the stage  the world is facing and the current status of Arab reality. He  stressed the need to develop effective Arab solidarity and joint  Arab action so this will be the condition for formulating a  united pan-Arab stand, to which there is no alternative, in  order to win the battle of peace and to achieve a just peace.    The prime minister then spoke about the determination of  Syria, under the leadership of President Hafiz al-Asad, to  achieve a just and comprehensive peace as well as its  determination not to relinquish any inch of its or any Arab  territory. He said:    [Begin al-Zu'bi recording] The Geneva summit between  Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton [applause] showed how  objective the Syrian stand is and how capable it is of defending  the principles of pan-Arabism and Arab interests. The Geneva  summit also showed how much attention the international  community gives to Syria's role in this region.    Syria made the Geneva convention a forum for the national  stand, the Arab right, pan-Arab dignity. The Geneva summit  highlighted the continuous achievements of a big Arab leader,  around the leadership of whom Syria's masses rally with  strength, awareness, and persistence. The masses of the Arab  nation surround leader al-Asad with their hopes, wishes, and  pan-Arab feelings. Syria was and still is determined to  continue the peace process, but with clarity, comprehensiveness  without separate deals, and full response to the international  community and its will and resolutions that cannot be subject to  changes or falsification. A just and comprehensive peace that  embodies the land for peace principle is the basis that enables  the peace process to continue without obstacles toward its true  objective. [end recording] [passage omitted]    Prime Minister Mahmud al-Zu'bi concluded his speech by  renewing allegiance to big leader President Hafiz al-Asad.  Al-Zu'bi expressed his sincerity toward President al-Asad's  great policy and triumphant leadership and toward continuing the  march of building and liberation, the objectives of which  President al-Asad outlined with responsibility and seriousness.

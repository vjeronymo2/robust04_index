			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Leading Article: EU carve-up Sir Leon Brittan may be disappointed, yet he cannot really be surprised. Saturday's sharing out of European Commission jobs forced Britain's senior commissioner to relinquish responsibility for eastern Europe to his chief rival, Mr Hans Van den Broek of the Netherlands. He is making no effort to hide his bruised feelings. Yet from a wider perspective, the Commission carve-up is far from a disaster. If it is messy, it is largely because there are now too many commissioners chasing too few jobs of substance. But Mr Jacques Santer, new Commission president, has done a perfectly reasonable job in recasting and dividing up the foreign policy portfolios - and, for the most part, in concentrating fire-power on the policy areas that matter. Moreover, before deciding whether to carry out his veiled threat to resign, Sir Leon should reflect both on the nature of the portfolio he still commands, and on the job he has had to drop. Trade remains the most important aspect of the Commission's external activities, and he still faces a formidable array of challenges, from securing implementation of the Uruguay Round to pursuing closer relations between Europe and the dynamic region from which it seems most remote, Asia. Nor, in relinquishing the eastern Europe job, is Sir Leon handing over to a protectionist or to someone determined to thwart the accession of the central European countries to the EU. There is little doubt that Mr Van den Broek will set about the vital task of preparing for the Union's next enlargement with gusto. What is more, the eastern question is one for the whole Commission, not just one commissioner. If it is to admit new members, Brussels will have to implement changes to its budgetary, trade, agriculture and social policies. Sir Leon will have plenty of influence in all these areas.</p>

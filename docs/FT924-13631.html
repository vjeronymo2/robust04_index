			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Repurchase facility set up LEHMAN Brothers International and Euroclear, the Brussels-based clearing house, have set up a tri-party repurchase facility aimed at encouraging banks and fund managers to enter the growing European repo market, writes Tracy Corrigan. Last month, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), Swiss Bank Corporation and Cedel announced the first tri-party repurchase agreement (repo) programme to be launched in Europe. The repo market allows institutions to boost returns by lending out securities on a short term basis. Tri-party programmes reduce the risk of failed trades and lower costs for counterparties deterred by complex processing involved in repurchase agreements.</p>

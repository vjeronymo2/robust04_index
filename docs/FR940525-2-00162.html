The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule changes from interested persons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> I.

Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its filing with the Commission, NSCC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. NSCC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NSCC currently applies a factor to the clearing fund requirement for members' non-CNS activity. The Depository Trust Company (``DTC'') settlement activity of members which NSCC sponsors into DTC (``sponsored members'') is included in the non-CNS calculation. The factor is applicable when certain amounts owed by the member to NSCC exceed the member's excess net capital. For the reasons set forth below, NSCC desires to eliminate application of the factor to the sponsored member's DTC settlement activity. In lieu thereof, NSCC has determined to add an additional advisory surveillance criteria to cover the circumstance where the debit activity of the sponsored member is greater that its excess net capital. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ``Advisory surveillance status'' permits NSCC, among other things, to increase on a discretionary basis the member's clearing fund requirement with respect to non-CNS activity up to sum of 5% of the member's average daily non-CNS debits plus 2&hyph;1/2% of the member's average daily non_CNS credits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In File No. SR&hyph;NSCC&hyph;82&hyph;10, <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  NSCC amended its clearing fund formula to permit the collection of additional clearing fund deposits from members using the envelope settlement systems. Prior to that filing, NSCC's clearing fund formula required each member to contribute an amount equal to 21/2% of the member's average daily debits and credits with NSCC. The amendment set forth in File No. SR&hyph;NSCC&hyph;82&hyph;10 broke out the debits and credits associated with the envelope settlement systems and required clearing fund deposits with respect to activity in those systems as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> NSCC's proposed rule change set forth in File No. SR&hyph;NSCC&hyph;82&hyph;10 was approved in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 18852 (June 18, 1982), 47 FR 29426. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Each Member would have to contribute an amount equal to 21/2NSCC of its average daily envelope settlement systems debits and credits or 5% of its average daily envelope settlement systems debits, whichever was greater. In each case, the amount would be multiplied by a factor which represented the number of times, if any, by which the Member's average daily settlement debits exceeded its excess net capital. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The factor was initially capped at twenty but was later limited to three in File No. SR&hyph;NSCC&hyph;82&hyph;24. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> NSCC's proposed rule change set forth in File No. SR&hyph;NSCC&hyph;82&hyph;24 was approved in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 19147 (October 18, 1982), 47 FR 47351. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As indicated in the File No. SR&hyph;NSCC&hyph;82&hyph;10, the primary purpose of the factor was to better protect NSCC against the risks presented by the envelope settlement systems (i.e., that securities delivered through the envelope settlement systems would not be available for return to the deliverer in the event the receiver were to become insolvent and be unable to pay for the delivery). The concern at the time of File No. SR&hyph;NSCC&hyph;82&hyph;10 arose from the stock loan business that was settled through the envelope settlement system. NSCC did not, however, limit the application of the factor to just physical envelope deliveries but also applied it to the DTC settlement activity of sponsored members.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NSCC believes that the current clearing fund formula, as applied to sponsored members, can result in excessive clearing fund requirements. This is because the formula seeks to cover a risk relating to DTC activity which NSCC believes can be adequately addressed without the application of the factor. The proposed rule change, while eliminating the factor in determining a sponsored member's clearing fund requirement with respect to DTC activity, gives NSCC the ability to place a sponsored member on advisory surveillance status under the circumstances where the factor previously would have been applied and therefore will allow NSCC to continue to assess the risks associated with sponsored members' DTC settlement activity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The elimination of the application of a factor in determining a sponsored member's clearing fund requirement with respect to DTC activity will more appropriately reflect the risks associated with such activity and will be consistent with the way DTC addresses such risks for dual NSCC/DTC members. Thus, it will result in a more equitable distribution of the financial burdens placed on NSCC sponsored members. Therefore, NSCC believes that this rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act, particularly section 17A of the Act, <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  and the rules thereunder. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78q&hyph;1 (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B.

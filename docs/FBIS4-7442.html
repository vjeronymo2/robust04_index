			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Address by Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency Vice President </F> Ejup Ganic to Bosnia-Herzegovina Constituent Assembly in  Sarajevo on 30 March -- live]    [Text] President Izetbegovic is presently holding talks  with the U.S. delegation, so I would like to greet you on his  behalf and my own, and to stress something that I have noticed  here, chatting to people I have not seen for a long time. You  see, many problems have been solved. Two nations have agreed to  go for the reconstruction of Bosnia as an integral state. I  have not heard a single ugly word from any representative of the  Croatian people or the Bosniak people about the Serbian people  during our socializing here.    Now when one thinks about it and takes into account that  there are some 500,000 to 550,000 Serbs on the territory  controlled by that army of Karadzic's, that there are some  200,000 Serbs who stayed with us to defend Bosnia, and that many  have left, I would like to send them a message: They should  integrate all their forces and we will make an effort to talk  with all of them, both with those who have left Bosnia, and of  course those who are with us -- we cooperated on a daily basis  -- and with those who are armed and failed to show loyalty to  the state of Bosnia-Herzegovina. This agreement, this agreement  that has been reached, it is not to anyone's disadvantage. This  is an agreement of equal opportunities and rights for the three  nations, and all the other nations.    I have said this before: One of the negotiators has said  that the integral Bosnia will be saved when first two of the  nations agree. However, I think there are more than two  nations, that there are (forces) in the Serbian people, but they  have to be integrated, they have to articulate their views  [words indistinct] an integral Bosnia, since the (blood) of that  nation has been spilt here, their historical monuments are here,  their shrines -- just as the culture of the Bosniak people,  their monuments and their shrines spread throughout the  territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina, from the Una River to the Drina  River. We will try to conduct such a policy, to take advantage  of the positive -- what to call it -- momentum, the positive  momentum to continue the peace process with the aid of the  international community.    Of course, the war criminals will end up where they belong.  I would like to tell them, that segment of the Serbian people  who have been deceived, that they should remember Hitler's  proverb: If the German nation does not follow my ideas, then it  does not deserve to exist. Therefore, fascists have always had  similar messages. I call on the entire Serbian nation to  integrate and fight since the more you try to divide Bosnia the  more it looks the same.    I again stress that through my contacts here -- not speaking  of [word indistinct] whom I meet frequently, but the deputies  from the Una River to the Drina River -- noone said that this  agreement was to the detriment of [words indistinct]. When one  understands it, when one [words indistinct] [applause].    Therefore that is the message, and I think that we have now,  with this act, thoroughly simplified the problem of the Bosnia-  Herzegovina crisis. Things have come around full circle and  that is how the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina will finally end.  The troops that crossed the Drina River must go back there or  they will eventually be defeated. Still it would be good if the  Serbian people were to integrate their forces, so that we can  reach an agreement and unveil their flag here, too. I know, of  course, that there are many Serbs who have fought for Bosnia and  died for Bosnia, some of them are here with us. I repeat that  this agreement has been reached by healthy forces from the ranks  of the Croatian and the Bosniak people -- I always mention first  the people to whom I do not belong out of some academic  principles of my own. The Presidency and Federation bodies will  continue to struggle for peace throughout the territory. We do  not ask for anything except that every man have his house  returned to him and that every man have his property returned to  him, because pillage cannot be accepted at the beginning of the  21st century.    I wish to salute you with these words, and I wish you  continuing happy efforts. Thank you very much.</p>

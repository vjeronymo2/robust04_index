			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Andrews Sykes splits advice Independent directors of Andrews Sykes, the specialist industrial services group, yesterday issued split advice to shareholders over a buy-out bid from Mr Jacques Murray, the chairman. The two non-executive directors, Mr Michael Gailer and Mr Michael Haines, advised shareholders to reject the bid of 50p per ordinary share if they have confidence in the group's potential. However, they added that risk-averse shareholders should consider selling in the market. Holders of preference shares are recommended to reject outright a bid of 12p per share in the formal offer document which was posted yesterday. Ordinary shares closed down 2p at 74p yesterday, while preference shares remained unchanged at 43p. The offer, which values the company at Pounds 8.24m, was triggered under the City takeover code in mid-August when European Fire Protection Holdings' stake in the group passed the 29.9 per cent threshold. Since then European Fire, a private Netherlands-based company owned by Mr Murray, has increased its holding to 42.1 per cent of the ordinary shares and 8.3 per cent of preference shares. Andrews Sykes is in the midst of a reorganisation to refocus on its core activities of pumping, heating, air conditioning and its UK-based hire business. The company's UK bankers have demanded that the group, whose gearing stood at 256 per cent on March 31, reduces borrowings from about Pounds 16m to Pounds 9.9m by January 31, 1995. The company has not yet paid the dividend on preference shares due on June 1. Distributable reserves stood at just Pounds 11,000 on March 31. The group holds its annual meeting today.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, April 4 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Malaysia  hopes for greater flow of investments from Swedish companies  into this country, especially in the field of high technology.    Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed conveyed this message to  his Swedish counterpart Carl Bildt during an hour-long meeting  at the Prime Minister's Department here Monday.    Dr. Mahathir hoped Bildt's visit, the first by a Swedish  prime minister, would further boost trade between both  countries, Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi told reporters  after the meeting.    Bildt and his four-member delegation arrived here Sunday for  a three-day official visit aimed at enhancing bilateral ties.    Abdullah, who was present during the meeting, said both  prime  ministers agreed that the current good bilateral relations would  provide greater encouragement to expand economic relations and  to increase trade activities between the two countries.    Bildt invited Dr. Mahathir to visit his country and see for  himself the business opportunities available there, he added.    Abdullah said the discussions centred on the situation in  their respective countries and also in East Asia.    Dr. Mahathir also explained to Bildt Malaysia's Vision 2020  to become a developed country and the country's success in  fostering close relations among its multi-ethnic and  multi-religious people.    Bildt was impressed with the political stability in Malaysia  and the country's sound economy, he added.    The Swedish prime minister said Vision 2020 was an  inspiration for him and his country, Abdullah said.    Bildt was confident that the vision would pave the way for  more Swedish investments in Malaysia, he added.</p>

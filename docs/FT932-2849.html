			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Market testing process attacked A SENIOR manager of a French company which yesterday won the first significant contract in the market testing programme for contracting-out Civil Service functions has attacked the way the process is being operated. Mr Charles Cox, a director of computing services company Hoskyns, warned that the programme's objectives were being prejudiced by unrealistically framed tenders. Private-sector interest would wither unless companies could see better opportunities for profit, he said. Mr Cox, director of Hoskyns' public-sector division, said policymakers and civil servants had a poor understanding of the benefits of contracting out services to the private sector. 'Tenders are often framed in such a way that the scope for suppliers to deliver savings and still make an adequate return is very limited,' he said. Hoskyns, the UK arm of Cap Gemini Sogeti, Europe's largest computing services company, has been awarded the contract to run the Ministry of Defence's Operations West Data Centre in Devizes, Wiltshire. It won against competition from the Anglo-French Sema Group and an in-house bid. The company has revenues of about Pounds 100m a year from outsourcing or facilities management contracts. Some 60 staff at the Devizes centre will be transferred to Hoskyns' payroll.</p>

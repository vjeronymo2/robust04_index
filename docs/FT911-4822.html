			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / International Company News: Scott Paper declines heavily SCOTT PAPER, the world's largest producer of toilet tissue, paper towels and napkins, yesterday combined news of a 51 per cent slump in first-quarter net earnings, with details of top management changes. Scott said it made Dollars 29.3m after tax in the three months to March 30, on sales of Dollars 1.23bn, compared with Dollars 60.1m last time. However, the 1991 figures exclude earnings and sales from those 'non-strategic' businesses which Scott has put up for sale. If these were also excluded from the 1990 results, sales would have risen year-on-year by 10 per cent, while operating income would have declined by 17 per cent. The 1990 contribution to net income from these businesses was negligible. Scott blamed the profits drop on the depressed US economic environment, and on the repairs to the recovery boiler needed at its Somerset mill in Maine. These factors, it said, caused a sharp earnings fall at S. D. Warren, the printing and publishing papers subsidiary. By contrast, it suggested that Scott Worldwide, the personal care and cleaning business, showed improved results, while the international operations had 'an excellent quarter'. Earnings in Europe advanced by 70 per cent, thanks to an improvement in the UK and the inclusion of results from the Scott-Feldmuhle sanitary tissues joint ventures, formed at the end of last year. Meanwhile, as part of an executive reorganisation, Mr Richard Leaman, previously president of Scott Worldwide, is becoming vice-chairman of the company and president of S. D. Warren. Mr Robert McAvoy, former head of S. D. Warren, 'has elected to retire'. Mr Philip Lippincott, group chairman, said the changes resulted from 'the critical need for us to improve our short-term performance and reduce our debt'.</p>

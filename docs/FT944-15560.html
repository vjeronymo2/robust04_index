			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Blair at risk of revolt on defence Mr Tony Blair is battling to head off a revolt by leftwing Labour backbenchers in the Commons tonight in the first vote on defence policy since he became party leader. A group of leftwing MPs is expected to vote against the entire defence estimates - the government's projected funding for the defence department - defying Mr Blair's call for Labour MPs to abstain. In an attempt to avoid a split Mr Blair last night tabled a wide-ranging amendment condemning the government for imposing piecemeal cuts and failing to hold a comprehensive review of defence policy. His amendment also deplores the effect of the cuts on areas dependent on defence contracts, and presses for more effective economic assistance for hard-hit regions. But the amendment fails to call for defence spending to be cut to the average level of other western European countries, nor does it seek the scrapping of the Trident missile system - as demanded by last week's Labour conference. This demand has again been backed by a group of prominent leftwing backbenchers. They have tabled their own amendment to the government motion seeking approval for the defence estimates. If, in accordance with precedent, they are denied an opportunity to vote for the amendment they will argue that voting against the entire estimate is the only effective way of backing the decision taken by the conference. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, predicted yesterday that Mr Blair would not be able to prevent another open split on defence policy.</p>

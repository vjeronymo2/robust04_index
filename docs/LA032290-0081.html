			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TODAY'S SCHOOL NURSE IS NO 'BAND-AID QUEEN';  </P> <P> HEALTH: A PILOT PROGRAM SENDS THEM TO EIGHT ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS EACH WEEK TO  SCREEN FOR EVERYTHING FROM MALNOURISHMENT TO WAR-RELATED STRESS.  </P> <P> Virginia Hayes sits in a sparsely decorated office, applying equal amounts of  Band-Aids and TLC to the knee-scraped children who come through her door. On a  busy day, one or two feverish children may rest on a cot until their parents  arrive to take them home.  </P> <P> A typical picture of today's school nurse? Not exactly.  </P> <P> "People have the stereotyped image about school nurses being like a Band-Aid  queen. But when you're dealing with a district like ours, where children come  from all over the world and often travel great distances each day to go to  school, it's the farthest thing from the truth," said Hayes, director of  nursing services for the Los Angeles Unified School District.  </P> <P> "We're talking about everything from malnourishment, severe dental problems and  lack of immunizations, to post-traumatic stress syndrome in children from  war-torn countries," she said. "In the past, those haven't exactly been your  typical school nurse health concerns."  </P> <P> Last year, at the urging of school officials and community groups, the school  district instituted a pilot program at eight Los Angeles and San Fernando  Valley elementary schools to meet those student health needs. Under the  Capacity Adjustment Program (CAP), school nurses were assigned to different  schools each week to screen students for health care and other support  services.  </P> <P> Children from low-income families were referred to school-affiliated clinics,  where dental, vision and other health services are provided on a sliding-scale  basis.  </P> <P> Since its inception, the program has been expanded to address the needs of  about 35,000 students who travel by bus to school, according to CAP Resource  Coordinator Modesta Bassity. CAP now includes 14 traveling nurses -- 11 of whom  serve 60 schools in the San Fernando Valley.  </P> <P> "We can catch problems a lot quicker now that interfere with learning," said  Jayne Lawson, a former pediatric nurse who travels to various schools in the  Valley. "A lot of times, the parents haven't known what to do or where to go."  </P> <P> Providing information to parents, Lawson said, is often an essential part of  the program. Lawson recalled one recent health screening of an 8-year-old  Latino girl who lives in Los Angeles and attends an elementary school in the  Valley. The girl's teacher had sent the child to see Lawson after noticing that  she was sleepy in class and had difficulty paying attention.  </P> <P> Although Lawson noted immediately that the girl was underweight for her age,  further checking revealed that she received breakfast each day at school.  </P> <P> "It wasn't until I looked at her teeth that I understood the problem," Lawson  said. "She had such massive cavities that her teeth had eroded away to little  nubs. It was horrible. Eating was painful for her."  </P> <P> Lawson contacted the girl's parents and told them about low-cost dental  services that were available through the school district. Later, she visited  the parents at their home to discuss the importance of proper nutrition and  hygiene.  </P> <P> "The mother was very concerned, but she hadn't had any idea about what foods  were good for her child," she said. "She had been giving her foods that were  very high in sugar and didn't know very much about protein."  </P> <P> Children are also screened by traveling nurses for vision problems that, nurses  say, often have gone undetected or untreated. Through two district-affiliated  clinics in the Valley, children who qualify can receive low-cost glasses.  </P> <P> "For a lot of poor families, dental and vision problems are low priorities,"  said Janis Lake, who works as a traveling school nurse in Granada Hills. "A lot  of the children literally cannot see, but the parents haven't known that these  services were available."  </P> <P> Cultural and language differences can exacerbate health problems. The Los  Angeles Unified School District has seven major ethnic groups and as many as 90  different languages spoken in its schools.  </P> <P> Patricia Hughes, another traveling school nurse and past president of the  Council of School Nurses, said she sees many cases that require contacting  parents and providing nutritional information. "We send letters home with the  children, but many times the parents can't read. That's when we call. When you  have children from Cambodia and Vietnam, where they lived on rice and water for  a long time, the parents need to realize how the children have been physically  affected."  </P> <P> There also have been cases in which a child complains of an ailment, such as a  stomachache or headache, for which no physical cause can be found. In such  cases, Hayes said, the nurses often work as detectives, looking for something  in the child's past that will give them a clue to the problem.  </P> <P> "Some children show signs of post-traumatic stress from war, such as with  children from El Salvador," Hayes said. "They've seen a lot of death and carry  it around with them. We see the same thing in a lot of children from Los  Angeles who have had family members killed by gangs," she said. "Sometimes you  need to talk to a child to understand the source."  </P> <P> For Lawson, who formerly worked as a pediatric nurse, the satisfaction she gets  from her job far outweighs the occasional expression she sees when she tells  people what she does for a living.  </P> <P> "Telling people you are a school nurse can kind of be a conversation stopper,  because they sometimes have that look of, 'Big deal.' But it is a big deal,"  she said. "We're reaching a lot of children, and we're making a big difference  in their lives in what often are little ways."  </P> <P> Lawson smiled. "Not everyone can say that."  </P></p>

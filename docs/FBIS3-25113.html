			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Durban Feb 5 SAPA--Democratic Party [DP] leader Zach  de Beer on Saturday [5 February] reiterated his plea to the  Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] to participate in the April  election, saying that while prospects for this seemed slim, "I  hope they won't stay out of the process". Speaking at the DP's  Natal annual congress, Dr. de Beer said: "If the IFP stays out  (of elections) it benefits their enemies. We want them to take  their proper part in the process."    DP members from Natal's five sub-regions of the party  gathered at the Durban Exhibition Centre on Saturday for a  day-long meeting of the party's annual congress.    There Dr. de Beer argued the case for federalism in South  Africa and the need for a double ballot. He said devolution of  power diminished the chance of tyrannical rule. Voters were  urged to put their cross next to the party they really believed  in, he said, because proportional representation meant every  vote counted. He warned against "tactical voting", saying it  was not necessary to vote for one party just to keep another out  of power.    Referring to the DP's lacklustre showing in recent opinion  polls, Dr. de Beer said: "Let's face it, the polls have been  depressing for the DP, but don't read too much into it though."    The DP leader cautioned voters against trusting the African  National Congress and the National Party [NP], which both had  the tendency to "hold human rights in contempt". DP Natal  Chairman and Umhlanga MP Kobus Jordaan echoed this, saying the  interim constitution had elements of a liberal constitution, but  was to an extent "shabby" because of private deals struck  between the ANC and NP.    University of Natal academic and DP member on the  constitutional technical committee, George Devenish, said the  interim constitution, although imperfect, was a liberal,  democratic one. Prof Devenish said there was provision for an  entrenched bill of rights, a human rights commission, and public  protector, but negatively there was single ballot voting, a lack  of unequivocal federal definition, and an unqualified  anti-deflection clause.    Various DP speakers were due to discuss numerous  electioneering and campaigning issues later in the day, and hold  annual elections for the leadership of the party in Natal.  Results are expected to be announced later Saturday.</p>

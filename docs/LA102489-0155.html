			<p><P> October 24, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> COUNTY TO SEND ENGINEERS TO HELP ASSESS QUAKE DAMAGE IN S.F.  </P> <P> Orange County will send a team of as many as 90 engineers to help assess  earthquake damage in San Francisco so that relief aid for the Bay Area can be  expedited, the Board of Supervisors was told this morning.  </P> <P> Hugh Wood, director of the Emergency Management Division for the county, said  10 engineers will leave today. As many as 80 more will be sent Thursday, he  said. Emergency management officials worked through the night Monday rounding  up civil and structural engineers from both the public and private sector.  </P> <P> A team of four firefighters and an observer has been working in the Bay Area  since last Thursday and assisted in the rescue Saturday of the last known  survivor on the Nimitz Freeway. Wood said preliminary reports from the team  indicate that communications among local, state and federal agencies have not  worked as well as envisioned in the area's emergency plans.  </P> <P> Wood said Orange County should re-evaluate its interagency communication plans  in the light of the problems in San Francisco.  </P> <P> "There was a lack of effective communication" among various levels of  government, Wood told the supervisors. "It didn't work as the plans said it  should."  </P> <P> Supervisors' Chairman Thomas F. Riley has asked Wood to report back next week  on the county's overall emergency planning.  </P> <P> "It's essential for the Board of Supervisors to evaluate our current  capabilities and take whatever steps are necessary to deal with the very real  possibility of an earthquake here in Orange County," Riley said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Text] Nine Israelis were killed and dozens were injured  today when a car bomb exploded in the heart of 'Afula  settlement, in northern occupied Palestine. An Israeli military  official said that so far nine Israelis had died and 50 others  had been injured, most of them seriously. The official added  that the explosion was the result of a suicide attack.    News reports said that a massive fire engulfed the scene of  the explosion. Another Israeli official described the scene as  a horrible sight. News reports have also indicated that, after  this explosion, which shook the Israeli settlement, Israeli  enemy forces surrounded the area, sealed off all roads from and  to the occupied West Bank, and began a series of arrests among  the Palestinians.    Thus, the illusion of peace which is being promoted has been  exposed. It has now been confirmed that real peace could be  achieved only with the return of the occupying invaders, who  have colonized Palestine, to their original homelands, the  return of the Palestinian people to their homeland, and the  establishment of a democratic state of Palestine where  Palestinians, Muslims, Christians, and Jews can live together.  If this is not achieved, there can only be more massacres, more  killings, and more bloodshed.    What happened today confirms an obvious reality -- namely,  that there will be no stability for the invaders, whatever means  of repression they use and however much blood they shed. The  only road of escape for the occupiers is to return immediately  to the countries from which they have come as invaders.</p>

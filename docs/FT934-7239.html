			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / International Company News: Credito Italiano warns of higher loan loss provisions CREDITO Italiano, the Italian bank to be privatised next month, warned investors yesterday that provisions for possible loan losses this year will be much higher than in 1992 and exceed amounts deductible for tax purposes. In spite of the warning, made in the preliminary prospectus, a senior executive did not foresee any need for a dividend cut and said 1993 profits should be in line with the net L202.2bn (Dollars 121.2m) made in 1992. The need for higher provisions stems from the bank's heavy exposure to some leading problem debtors, notably Ferruzzi. The impact of a big increase in provisions would be accentuated by Italy's tax rules, which oblige banks to pay tax on setting aside more than a marginal increase in provisions. The effect of higher provisions and tax will be partly offset by the 55 per cent jump in the bank's fee income to L536bn in the first half of 1993, when group earnings after tax and provisions were L150.6bn. Mr Romano Prodi, chairman of the IRI state holding company which controls Credito Italiano, said the sale was 'essential' to restore IRI's finances. IRI's group debt is expected to rise to L74,000bn by December, about L1,000bn more than the previous year, although the proportion attributable to the parent company should fall marginally. Mr Prodi said IRI hoped to raise about L20,000bn from asset sales.</p>

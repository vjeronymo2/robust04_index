			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour warns of council job cuts LABOUR'S national executive committee, the party's ruling body, has warned all Labour groups in local government that compulsory redundancies 'may be unavoidable' in some councils. Next year may be the most difficult for Labour councillors since 1979 when the Tories came to power, the NEC says. The advice to councillors was disclosed yesterday as Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, launched a pre-emptive attack on the government's detailed plans for local government finance, which will be announced tomorrow. The NEC advises Labour groups to concentrate on protecting 'frontline' services provided direct to the public. On the education budget, it says that it is vital to maintain the level of the 'aggregate schools budget' rather than central services, because that will affect schools' assessment of whether they should opt out. Increasing charges or reducing concessions on the basis of an authority-wide policy, as an alternative to even more unpalatable cuts, is recommended instead of leaving charges to be set by individual service committees. The guidance also suggests drawing up the budget on the basis of 'clearly determined political priorities', and points out that these may not reflect previous patterns of provision. Mr Straw said yesterday that with the transfer of further education away from councils and their new responsibility for community care, the government's plans for what local councils could spend in total next year would leave local-authority employees facing a pay freeze rather than increases of even 1.5 per cent.</p>

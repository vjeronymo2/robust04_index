			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE  </P> <P> TALK OF THE TOWN: So is Michael Jackson going to have a new manager or not?  That's Topic A in record-biz circles this week, now that most execs are getting  over their shock and dismay at seeing their names in (or not in) the dreaded  "Hit Men" expose, which has already jumped to No. 8 on The Times' best-seller  list. Initially, the hottest contenders were the top management duos of Stiefel  &amp; Edwards and Lippman &amp; Kahane.  </P> <P> But with L&amp;K having split up and S&amp;E involved with Prince (whom Jackson  considers a pop rival) a new name has emerged among industry insiders as a  leading candidate. The hot ticket? Veteran manager Sandy Gallin, who handles  the likes of Neil Diamond, Dolly Parton and Andrew Dice Clay. Gallin is also  considered a favorite by some observers because of his friendship with David  Geffen, Jackson's confidante and close adviser. Meanwhile, execs at CBS  Records, Jackson's label, are nervously awaiting an upcoming meeting with Bert  Fields, the influential (and combative) entertainment attorney who is handling  Jackson's renegotiations with CBS.  </P></p>

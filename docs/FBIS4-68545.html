			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Larisa Kislinskaya: "By the Law of Crime--Otari </F> Kvantrishvili: They Give It All to Me of Their Own Volition"]    [Text] Whoever aimed that gun at Otari Kvantrishvili,  the shots sounded in the border zone of power. Kvantrishvili was  a man who personified the attributes of our time. Authoritative  in criminal communities and respected by the establishment and  high society, he represented solid proof of sociologists'  contentions that respectable capital draws its strength from  shadow sources. While continuing to generate income of  "unidentified origin," he at the same time took pains to create  a completely different image for people of this kind: He  invested immense sums in reinforcing his image as a public  figure, helped the sports movement, and justly criticized the  policy of breaking-up the Union. Over a short period of time he  was able to achieve great popularity.    There is probably no other criminal reporter whose  creative paths crossed the "Kvantrishvili topic" as frequently  as those of Larisa Kislinskaya. In several published materials  she persistently drew the readers' attention to dark spots in  his biography. As a result, she earned the honor of the  "godfather" referring to her by name... She got several threats  over the telephone, and one even delivered on television (!).  Truly, we have strange ways of using our scarce air time.    It appears that a period of "extraordinary circumstances"  has  begun for the kingpins of the criminal world. Over the past  several months alone the leader of Balashikha group, Sergey  Frolov, was killed; Grigoriy Solomatin--the "authority" who shot  Frolov--disappeared immediately thereafter. Also shot and killed  were Sergey Sokolov, one of the gang leaders of the Pushkino  group, and Sultan Daudov, the only Chechen crime boss living in  the Moscow suburbs. Andrey Isayev--a crime boss nicknamed  Signature [Rospis]--having barely recovered from old wounds,  nearly got blown up in a car. This assassination attempt failed,  too: Although Signature was seriously wounded, he is alive; two  girls were seriously maimed by TNT charges the car was  boobytrapped with, and a nearby militiaman was wounded. A second  assassination attempt did succeed in the case of Vyacheslav  Vanner (nicknamed Bobon)--the right-hand man of the crime boss  nicknamed Globe [Globus] (Valeriy Dlugach) shot to death almost  a year ago. Yuriy Stupenkov, president of the Russian  professional league Kitek and the professional club by the same  name, got caught in sniper fire. He had a previous conviction  and enjoyed a certain authority in capital city criminal  circles--like the previously convicted famous boxer Oleg  Karatayev, who was shot to death at Brighton Beach. The Georgian  crime boss Dzhamal Mikeladze (nicknamed Arsen), on the other  hand, was killed in Tbilisi. Another old Georgian crime boss  Givi Beradze (nicknamed Scarface Givi) also disappeared. Small  gang leaders of the Pushkino and Koptevo-Dolgoprudnoye criminal  groups were pursued and disposed of with enviable persistency.  One might think, what else could happen that could shock  Muscovites, who are used to everything by now?    However, the murder of Otari Kvantrishvili, president of the  Lev Yashin Foundation for Social Protection of Sportsmen, former  vice president of the 21st Century association, was a real  sensation. Not because it was clearly a contract murder, as  evidenced by the rifle with optical scope left in the attic of  the house where the sniper fire came from, and the fact that the  killers and their customers definitely knew that on Tuesdays  between 1400 and 1800 Otari Kvantrishvili unfailingly visited  Krasnopresnenskiy bathhouse. It was the identity of the slain  person. He was known for his charitable activities; he appeared  on television almost every evening urging protection of the  Russian genetic fund and Russian statehood; he even appeared at  militia concerts; at the same time, in the unanimous opinion of  enforcement services, he was a major "authority" in the crime  world and could easily claim the title of a "godfather" of our  mafia.    So who was Otari Kvantrishvili in reality, in whose way did  he stand, and who is behind his murder? It is practically  impossible to give an exhaustive answer to these questions, but  we will try to reconstruct some pages from the biography of the  man who is now buried next to Vladimir Vysotskiy--in the same  place where a little earlier his brother Amiran, shot to death  in August of last year in the course of gang score-settling in  the office of the Vodoley international enterprise on Bolshaya  Yakimanka Street, found his final resting place.    Several thousand people gathered at Vagankovskoye cemetery  on  8 April--the day of junior Kvantrishvili's funeral. Among them  were such famous people as Iosif Kobzon, a friend and cohort of  the deceased in many undertakings; the singers Aleksandr  Rozenbaum and Anatoliy Dneprov; the comedian Oleg Marusev; and  famous athletes and public figures. And this is quite  understandable--the deceased had friends among militia generals,  marshals, Olympic champions, artistic bohemia, television  commentators, and journalists, and had "access" to the very top  echelons of authority. But at the same time this funeral was  attended by crowds of athletic-looking young men dressed either  in cashmere coats or tight leather. All of them were hiding  behind dark glasses or turned away from photographers and  television cameramen. Some journalists were warned: "Do not take  close shots or we will smash your camera." Others were permitted  to take only panoramic shots or pictures of famous performers.  This is also understandable: All these people are active members  of the so-called organized crime groups--Izmaylovo, Solntsevo,  Balashikha, Kazan, and Dolgoprudnoye. There was, of course, a  large delegation representing the Georgian criminal community  operating in Moscow. At this sort of event enmity is put  aside--the "Chechen community" also sent its delegates.  According to some information, all the well-known crime bosses  (there are almost 50 Georgian and 14 Armenian ones alone living  in Moscow) bid their farewell to the deceased during the night,  after he had been eulogized in the church right here on  Vagankovskoye cemetery. It is not yet known whether criminal  "authorities"--leaders of aforementioned groups--were among  them. All of them clearly did not want to come into view of  enforcement services, knowing very well that Otari Vitalyevich's  funeral would be shown on television on numerous occasions.  There were even rumors that the famous crime boss Vyacheslav  Ivankov, nicknamed "the Jap," may arrive from the United States  incognito, wearing a wig and makeup. Either he got cold feet,  however (after all, he is on the federal wanted list here), or  the makeup was exceptionally good...    The crowd that gathered at Vagankovskoye cemetery that day  and then later at the wake at the Moscow Hotel was as disparate  in composition as the opinions about the deceased. Although  Otari Kvantrishvili was born in 1948 in the Georgian town of  Zestafioni and spent his early childhood there, he considered  Krasnaya Presnya his home (it is symbolic that this is where he  was killed, and this is where he was buried). Over the past few  years, though, he lived in Odintsovskiy Rayon, in a house  purchased from Marshal Savitskiy. In the same area he built  another mansion--with a pool, steam bath, and a training  wrestling gym. He watched his health carefully, engaged in  sports, and did not drink or smoke. He did gamble, though.    He started card games together with his brother at the  Sovetskaya Hotel. In militia jargon, their specialization was  called "rollers." It was then that the two young talents were  noticed by famous crime bosses of old school--Anatoliy Cherkasov  (nicknamed Cherkas), Leonid Korolev (nicknamed the Loafer), and  Scarface Givi. It was these crime bosses, whom Otari Vitalyevich  worshipped at the time, who entrusted him with "watching over"  the racetrack and keeping an eye on the totalizator. The crime  bosses placed their bets on the younger brother, since the older  one had a reputation as an active gambler and a very unlucky  one, despite the fact that this whole team played only in their  own digs, specially equipped with imported radio and television  systems, optical devices installed by engineers and physicists.  This is where they skinned gullible plebeians.    Otari Vitalyevich soon realized, however, that it is not a  good idea to limit his social circle to just criminal  "authorities": He was a professional athlete; later worked as a  coach at the Dynamo stadium. This is where he acquired many  acquaintances in militia circles. He was very proud of these  ties, and imposed his company even on top officials of criminal  investigations. Until the last moment he made it clear to  criminals of his acquaintance that he could help, that he had it  "all covered" over there. I remember how in one telephone  conversation with the author of this material (I will tell you  the reason for these calls a little further on), Kvantrishvili  mentioned that he had raised many athletes who now work in the  MVD and KGB system and help him. And that he is like a father to  them--and this is not at all because of money... As the  conversation went on, the main character of Mario Puzo's  "Godfather" unwittingly came to mind. Because Don Corleone, too,  demanded only favors and loyalty of the people he helped.    Let us go back to the younger years of our hero. In 1966 he  had a little mishap--he was sentenced to nine years for  participation in a group rape. He got an early release--after  four years, somehow a medical report surfaced on his  psychological ill-being, which said that the prisoner was  suffering from latent schizophrenia. At the time the Moscow  criminal world was run by the crime boss Gennadiy Karkov,  nicknamed Mongol. As soon as he was put behind bars, the throne  went to another kingpin of the criminal world, Mongol's  disciple, the Jap. When finally in 1982 Ivankov also was put on  ice, Otari Vitalyevich remained free, despite the fact that the  criminal file on the Jap's case contains documents showing that  the sportsman had some part in the actions of Ivankov and Co.  Later, this patron was not forgotten, either. Besides, the old  "boss" Cherkasov died, and O. Kvantrishvili buried him, helped  his family. While Ivankov "languished" in a Tula camp,  Kvantrishvili raised his sons, and got them involved in  athletics. A real opportunity to help the Jap opened only in  1989. Such frenetic activities were launched to free him that in  the haste this especially dangerous repeat offender--who, while  being in the zone, never lifted anything heavier than a  glass--almost got amnestied for shock labor and exemplary  behavior. Well, he was not exactly amnestied, but he was indeed  released early. I told this entire story in March 1992 in an  article "Crime Bosses and Their Benefactors." I was warned at 38  Petrovka that Otari Vitalyevich would not overlook this--lately,  his greatest concern had been his clean image. And his image was  by then indeed quite well shaped: a patron of the arts, a  fixture on television, children's and sportsmen's best friend.  Having spent some time finding out my unlisted address and  telephone number, Otari Vitalyevich called me at the beginning  of summer 1992. He was very polite: "As a Christian and a father  of four, I feel that a misfortune may befall you. There is plot  being hatched, and possibly something will happen to you, but  this will not be my fault, and I have already written a  statement to this effect to the Krasnopresnenskiy Rayon  procurator." He had always been a man of foresight: If he  happened to go out carrying arms in his younger years (later on  he had almost 150 bodyguards protecting him), he had a gun in  one pocket and in the other--a statement to the procuracy: "I  was walking down the street when I found this gun, and I am  surrendering it to you."    He already hated me with a passion by then, as he told  mutual  acquaintances in militia circles. "Well, you are a Georgian--are  you going to fight a woman?" one general asked him. "I do not  fight women," my telephone companion soon told me. "But when a  juggernaut like me gets moving, you understand..." He himself  told me more than once, and it was not hard for me to guess,  that his calls were of a tactical-preventive nature. He did not  refute anything that I had written, especially considering that  in the article on the subject of the Jap's early release, Otari  Vitalyevich did not figure very prominently (there were more  substantial names mentioned in it). He simply used to call at  about 2300, ask why I sounded unhappy, complain that the militia  was unfair to him...    It so happened that I published part of our  conversation--also as a preventive measure--in the next article,  in which I described Otari Vitalyevich's role in freeing from  prison a certain "authority" nicknamed Plum. A member of  Ivankov's gang and his emissary in Moscow, Plum was detained in  Solnechnoye Motel with enough drugs to convict two; as time  passed, however, the dope "evaporated" to symbolic proportions,  and the Jap's best friend was free again.    This article did not interfere with our telephone  "friendship" either. This ended in August 1993, when the older  brother Amiran was shot to death. Strangely, the loving younger  brother directed all his wrath not at the cutthroats who had  killed the unarmed Amiran when the latter, together with a  Samara criminal nicknamed Crazy Fedya, came to sort things out  with members of the "Chechen community" in the office of Vodoley  company, but again at a journalist who wondered why criminal  world "authorities," of which Amiran was one, are buried at the  cemetery that is the traditional resting place for those who had  been the pride of the nation.    By the way, Amiran Vitalyevich had not cared to create for  himself an image like his brother's. He had different hobbies:  While remaining a card player, and having gone through the  school of prison, Amiran Vitalyevich suddenly became a  playwright and allegedly wrote a play. Moscow criminal  investigations detectives, attempting to follow this amusing  story, told me that the newly hatched writer manages to make at  least five mistakes even in a three-letter word.    Anyway, Otari Vitalyevich told me: "God will punish you. As  for me, this is the last time I will call you. My brother was  killed, and you call him a gangster." Quite possibly, God did  punish me for something--nobody is a saint--but not for this: A  gangster is a still a gangster even when he is dead.    The calls did indeed stop. But especially after October,  when  Otari Vitalyevich began to appear on television daily and many  of his speeches resembled preaching, I occasionally heard direct  hints addressed at me: "All these articles resemble the  relations between the Elephant and Moska the Dog. The time will  come when the Elephant will grow annoyed and will simply step on  Moska." The charitable foundation's president quite frequently  used precious air time for personal purposes: He upbraided  journalists who got out of line (some of them had dared to joke  about the appearance of a champion nominated by O.V. for  president of the sportsmen's party he had founded); he wagged  his finger at the militia, hinting that the chief of the  regional organized crime unit of the Moscow City Administration  of Internal Affairs has children. These were amazing broadcasts:  Anchormen cowed before him, and call-ins came only from people  who said something like "Oh, Otari Vitalyevich is such an  amazing person. We are grateful that he exists." One anchorman  could not help but draw a comparison: "In the past we  said--thank you, Leonid Ilich, for being; now the same is being  said to you, Otari Vitalyevich." I do not think I saw this  anchorman anymore.    The foundation president lectured Aleksey Matveyev, a  ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA sports reporter: "You will be knowledgeable  about sports when you stop arguing with me. And anyway, you are  too caustic, bitter. Think about it. Or you will get whacked."  My colleague published this, and a month later was hospitalized  with deep lacerations to his face. Such a coincidence.    He repeated many things to everyone. His phrase: "I do not  take away anything from anyone and do not even ask. They bring  everything and give it to me of their own volition" became  proverbial. Nevertheless in one of our evening telephone  conversations he mentioned one of our millionaires: "I tell  him--Artem, give a million to needy children. And he, the rat,  does not." I have also heard this opinion: Wherever his money  came from, he gave it to the indigent, children, and orphans.  Such a modern Robin Hood. But the times of noble robbers are  gone--now is the time of noble mafiosi. For instance, John  Gotti, the head of the powerful Italian clan of the American  Cosa Nostra, built a hospital for the poor in a New York borough  with his family's money. But in the United States, money  "laundered" this way did not clean up the influential mafioso in  the eyes of public opinion or in the eyes of the law.    For our vulnerable Criminal Code, people like Kvantrishvili  are invulnerable. He began building his fortune by helping to  collect debts--something done now partly by racketeering  brigades, and partly by private detective companies: one half of  the money for the client, one half for yourself. "I do not take  anything away from anybody..."    In quite a recent criminal case--kidnapping an Australian  couple for ransom--there is testimony by one of the suspects,  who told how his company Sovavstraltekhnika began to be  "visited" by racketeers. One employee suggested to the head of  the joint enterprise a meeting with Otari Vitalyevich and  remarked that the latter may help to settle the incident.  Kvantrishvili--at the time vice president of 21st Century--said  that everything could be taken care of provided that the company  become a member of his association and pay an initiation fee,  and also suggested that they sponsor a boxing association and  contribute money to the Uralochka volleyball team. This was not  all: Otari Vitalyevich demanded that the joint enterprise hire  his people (all of them were later charged with organizing the  kidnapping). In turn, "his people" began to dictate their terms  to the head of the company. Otari Vitalyevich's name also was  mentioned in court in connection with a case of "hooliganism" in  the fall of 1988. "Hooliganism" meant a shootout (at the time  this was still a sensation) between members of the Lyubertsy and  Dolgoprudnenskoye groups. The overzealous lawyer read out the  testimony of one of the defendants about to whom the gang, which  extorted protection money from cooperative members, prostitutes,  and merchants, paid its own "duty."    Another arrested businessman described how the foundation  president made others hire people to work for their company.  First he demanded a million for the needy, and then, on learning  that his request had been refused, sent the company a Balashikha  brigade led by a major "authority"--the now-deceased Frol. By  the way, Sergey Frolov and his gangsters were under Otari  Vitalyevich's protection, and so were the Solntsevo, Lyubertsy,  Podolsk, Dolgoprudnoye, and Kazan groups. Maintaining good  relations with the leaders of these gangs, Otari Vitalyevich  implanted "his eagles" from these gangsters into large  government organizations, commercial structures, and banks. This  in turn enabled the gangsters to launder money obtained through  criminal activities, as well as first claim some part of the  income of some or other company, and then later take complete  control of it. In short, he did not take away anything from  anyone and did not even ask. They brought everything to him and  gave it to him of their own volition.    He was a strong and wealthy man, but had no forgiveness  whatsoever for those who went against him. Although rumor has it  that he backed off when faced with a more formidable force.    One of the versions of his murder is based precisely on this  assumption. Everybody expected Otari Vitalyevich to take revenge  for the death of his older brother. This did not happen,  however. The Georgian "crime bosses" denounced him for this.  There are rumors that the "Chechen community" actually declared  war on him. Especially considering that he had had a conflict  with members of this clan over the privatization of one of the  largest hotels located not far from the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs. He set his sights on the hotel, which had already been  under the Chechen's "wing" for a long time; Otari Vitalyevich  backed off. In April this year Kvantrishvili traveled to St.  Petersburg, where he had an altercation with the local "crime  bosses." One can judge how serious this conflict was by the fact  that he asked the Lubyanka to assign to him a protection group  from the special unit "Vympel" (his 150 bodyguards were people  in a different line of specialization, to put it mildly). In  addition, Otari Vitalyevich acquired for himself a foreign  travel passport in a different name so that in case of danger he  could quietly slip out of the country (after all his talk of  love for the motherland). It is hard to tell what triggered this  conflict--division of spheres of influence or claims that the  foundation president had distanced himself too far from the  people (underworld people, that is). Otari Vitalyevich heard  this kind of comment from the Moscow "authorities" as well, who  were unhappy with the excessively intense political and social  activities of their acquaintance and his close ties to the  militia.    In the opinion of professionals, this kind of murder is done  only over money. And the money involved here is considerable.  Take, for instance, one of the sectors "supervised" by Otari  Vitalyevich--the gaming business. The profits are gigantic. But  lately a well-known "authority" Silvestr began to control an  increasingly greater share of this juicy morsel. There is talk  in the criminal underworld that a major leader had something to  do with the latest events. Besides, a friend and confederate of  Silvestr, but at the same time his rival--an "authority"  nicknamed Beard--some time ago disappeared under mysterious  circumstances. His corpse with a garrote around the neck was  recently fished out of the Yauza River. Besides, there are quite  a few people in Silvestr's entourage--and he does not hide this  fact--who are well-trained marksmen, who handle firearms  professionally...    Not without the approval of their American patron--the  Jap--Moscow mafiosi implement in practice the motto: The worse  it gets for the Russian mafiosi (Otari Kvantrishvili did not  hide his attitude toward the Slavic clan), the worse it gets for  "Chechens." And, as I have already mentioned, the Russian  mafiosi have lately encountered quite a few setbacks.    When gangsters get rid of gangsters, it is to their benefit  to implant in the public mind completely opposite versions.  Hence the rumors that the "hunt" on "authorities" is being  conducted by the MVD-KGB, and that allegedly a "White Arrow"  team had been set up for this purpose. It is not hard to guess  that with such rumors circulating, it is much easier to get rid  of rivals.    Overall, however, the latest events are evidence of complete  runaway lawlessness: Not only are major bankers and businessmen,  as well as accidental passersby, getting killed--the biggest  figures in the underworld are also getting knocked off. In the  past this was an extraordinary event in the criminal world. But  the current decline in moral standards has affected it,  too--there is already a whole new generation for whom there is  no authority, including criminal. This decline in morals also is  evident from the fact that the car of singer and composer  Vladimir Migul was blown up next to a school, on Paliashhvili  Street. An eyewitness to the event, the son of a girlfriend of  mine, said that the only thing that saved the kids was that it  happened in the middle of classes. And added: "When I was in  Italy I heard that there--the homeland of the Mafia--it is taboo  to settle scores near schools." Well, it may be taboo over  there. Here, however, virtual battles unfold in kindergartens,  many of which have been leased to commercial dealers. There have  already been two such instances in Moscow. In one the gangsters  even used the children as cover as they retreated. Neither is it  good manners "over there" to openly launder dirty money; here,  we say: "Who cares where the money came from; the important  thing is that he helped people." Over there, newspaper  disclosures may at least tarnish an image. Here this only costs  the journalist a cut-up face. Over there one cannot reach the  pinnacle of power with a questionable reputation. Here a  twice-convicted man may become an adviser to the vice president!  (By the way, Kvantrishvili supported a totalitarian state.  Although he did not show up on television back then, at least he  could live in peace.)    Over there, laws work; here, the mafia operates. And  although  Otari Vitalyevich was by status several orders of magnitude  higher than the leaders he knew and who had been killed a little  earlier, his life ended the same way--from a bullet meant  precisely for him. I have also heard this question: Are we not  on the threshold of mafia wars? I think that the latest events,  including those that took place in front of the  Krasnopresnenskiy bathhouse, tell us that the mafia has declared  war, but not on rivals--on statehood.</p>

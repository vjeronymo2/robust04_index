			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Knorr cube-making moved abroad CPC (UK), subsidiary of the US food group, is to move production of its Knorr brand of soups and cubes from Paisley, near Glasgow, to more modern CPC plants in France and Italy to cut costs. As many as 345 out of the 449 jobs at CPC's Paisley operations are to be lost, but the company hopes this can be done through voluntary redundancy and early retirement. The company said yesterday it had reached its decision 'after much concerted effort to reduce the cost of Knorr brand production at Paisley'. It said that overall costs remained 40 per cent higher than at other CPC plants. The company - whose European headquarters are in Brussels - is to expand production of the Knorr range at Dupprigheim in France and Sanguieth in Italy. These plants have larger production capacity than the Paisley plant, which will continue to produce Hellmann's mayonnaise. Ms Cathy Coveney, Transport and General Workers union convener at the Paisley plant, yesterday said the union was asking the company to produce its figures to substantiate its claim of a huge cost difference between the UK and Continental plants. Earlier this year Hoover concentrated its vacuum cleaner production at Cambuslang, near Glasgow, and closed its facilities in Dijon, France because of Britain's low labour costs. Knorr products have been made at Paisley for 30 years.</p>

			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Books: History seen with a glass of old port FROM NAPOLEON TO THE SECOND INTERNATIONAL: ESSAYS ON 19TH CENTURY EUROPE by AJP Taylor Hamish Hamilton Pounds 25, 426 pages THE TRAITOR WITHIN THE GATES by Robert Cole Macmillan, 285 pages It is natural to approach this collection of Alan Taylor's reviews, radio broadcasts and short essays with a light heart. For Taylor believed that history was fun to write and read and that the function of the historian was not just to instruct but to provoke and entertain. He admired the great stylists of the past, Gibbon, Macaulay and Carlyle, and was impatient with the poorly written book, however accurate. Chris Wrigley's selection brings delights and disappointments. There are only two of the longer essays to remind readers of Taylor's crystal-clear presentation of complex events, brilliantly linked with an eye to the emotable example. Few other modern historians could move with such confidence, as in 'The Last of Old Europe', from the business of high politics, wars and revolutions to the effects of sewing machines, bicycles and contraception on the position of women in the space of some 25 pages. Too many book reviews are included, most surprisingly gentle. Only occasionally, for one who had a sharp eye for detail, would he cross swords with the writer on grounds of accuracy. More often there would be a personal letter to the offending author pointing to an incorrect name or place. It is not usually the author who interested him, but the subject of the book. Reviews and talks provided the occasion for writing about the people of the past who fascinated, impressed or perplexed him. They allowed Taylor to show off his own personal gallery of heroes, Charles James Fox, William Cobbett, John Bright, the 'trouble makers', who were the subjects of Taylor's own favourite book and with whose dissenting views he identified. There were also villains, that 'dedicated historian' Leopold von Ranke, castigated for his worship of the state that nourished the roots of Nazism. Taylor returned repeatedly to the great men of European history, above all Bismarck, always finding something new to say as he grappled with the enigma of personality and policy. It is hard to think of any reviewer today who writes with Taylor's verve or certainty of judgment. Why the sense of disappointment? The reviews were often hastily written and over-emphatic. Though Taylor has style, he was not really a great stylist and few of the essays have improved with time. Radio talks, fondly remembered, do not translate well into print. Taylor was the master of the lecture hall, the radio and the television. His seemingly spontaneous and brilliantly controlled lectures packed the Oxford schools at nine in the morning. The same gifts, without resort to script of visual aids, won him a mass audience. When read, the impact of personality is lost and the thinness of the argument sometimes revealed. More unexpectedly, some of the essays seem strangely dated. The tone and concerns are of a different time and Taylor, himself, a figure of an earlier generation. It is here that Robert Cole's study of Taylor's major writings is both useful and perceptive. Admittedly this book offends against Taylor's first rule, for the recapitulation of the contents of old volumes is boring - something that can hardly be said of the originals. Nor would Taylor have liked the welcome attention paid to his non-conformist roots and anti-establishment position, the emphasis on the paradoxical nature of his writing and professional career. Taylor did not think he was a complicated figure. He loved writing history and was a political activist. He enjoyed being the enfant terrible of the historical profession and loved to exaggerate is so-called exclusion from the Academy. He found to his pleasure that he could communicate with a wide audience. It brought rich rewards even in Germany. What Cole makes clear is the degree to which Taylor's historical writings reflected his political interests and readings of contemporary events. He was a man of th e 1939-45 war and the 'cold war'. Much of his writing deals with the German problem and was the source of his deep-seated belief that there were no 'good Germans', only Germans. The disgruntled critic of the cold war and the campaigner against nuclear arms had no confidence in the Americans or the Russians. If his distrust of the Americans ran deeper than his fear of the Russians, it was because he believed that Anglo-Russian co-operation was the only protection against Great Germany. Against all systems of any kind, Taylor was 'a little Englander' convinced that Britain should retain her independence and free hand. Even his best, though not his most popular or influential book, The Struggle for the Mastery of Europe (1957), fused scholarly explanation with political argument. Based on a wide reading in the diplomatic sources which still makes it an outstanding piece of scholarship, the book was intended to educate both sides in the cold war. Already Taylor was moving into his dissenter and trouble-making mode. He was denouncing academic supporters of the cold war, addressing anti-Suez rallies and marching with the CND. He claimed to have spoken in more halls than John Bright did when opposing the Crimean War. There was always in Taylor's activities and writings a certain 'imp of the perverse' that made him a delightful sparring partner but which was as maddening to some of his admirers as to his detractors. It was Taylor's undisguised delight in rocking the boat and challenging the prevailing winds whether in politics or history that accounts for the vehemence of the attack on his The Origins of the Second World War. Cole shows how much historians were shocked by its amoralism and the emphasis on the accidental and unpredictable rather than on Hitler's responsibility for the war. This was unacceptable to academics of a generation who had fought against Hitler, particularly those engaged in the cold war against Stalinist Russia. Students today hardly understand what the furore was about. Some aspects of the Taylor thesis appear perverse or are seen as wrong, but new readers are not troubled by Taylor's moral relativism. Similarly, though English History, 1918-1945, can still be read with pleasure for Taylor is a master story teller, the populist theme and the triumphant ending with the British people, freed from the burdens of empire, poised to enter into their true inheritance strikes a false note in the world of 1993. In a very different and a greyer age, Taylor efforts to provoke have lost some of their resonance as have the political battles he so stridently fought. This may be what Chris Wrigley means when he suggests that for older readers his selections of Taylor's writings have the quality of a glass of old port after an excellent meal. This would not have been the comparison Taylor would have wanted.</p>

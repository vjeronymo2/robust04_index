			<p>BFN     [Text] Beginning today, the Cabinet of Ministers'  resolution has decreased prices for certain foodstuffs by 15  percent. By issuing this resolution, the Cabinet of Ministers  took control over mark ups and reduced all of them to (?10)  percent which enables customers to save a small sum of money.    For example, the price for sausages, which stood earlier at  28.700 rubles [R], decreased by R4.500. Beef became cheaper by  R3,000 and pork -- by R3.500. Beginning today, prices for bread  and flour products, meat offals, and butter --which were sold at  market prices -- have also been changed.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Ecerpt] About 5,000 people converged outside Parliament  yesterday to demand a new constitution as the coalition allies,  including the reluctant Phalang Tham Party, displayed a fragile  unity behind Prime Minister Chuan Likphai's stand against  "political intimidation".    Despite a common pledge not to push for the drafting of a  new  charter in the face of the biggest anti-government protest since  1992, a major rift within Phalang Tham threatened to tear the  party apart and ruin the government's questionable stability.    Parliament President Marut Bunnak was lobbying for a  last-ditch option to end the political deadlock yesterday. After  the coalition declared it would not sponsor any move to write a  new constitution, Marut proposed that he exercise his  parliamentary power to set up a committee to look into the  possibility of drafting a new charter.    It was not known whether political action groups leading the  constitution reform campaign would accept Marut's proposal,  which government politicians said was in line with the  coalition's stand that the issue was a parliamentary affair.    Clarifying Marut's proposal, Deputy House Speaker Thawin  Phraison said the parliamentary president was empowered to set  up an ad hoc committee to consider anything deemed a  parliamentary issue. However, Thawin declined to comment on  suggestions it was just a time-buying proposal since whatever  such a committee produced would still have to be considered by  the political parties.    In an atmosphere that eerily resembled the anti-Suchinda  protests before they exploded into the mass uprising leading to  the 1992 bloodshed, demonstrators yesterday loudly cheered as  speakers lambasted the Chuan government watched by lines of  stern police commandos.    Protest leaders said the turn-out was much larger than they  had anticipated.    "Today is not yet the day we will shout 'Chuan get out',"  Wira Musikaphong, recalcitrant deputy leader of the New  Aspiration Party, told the crowd. "We are just a group of  democratic beggars who will remain here until we get a  satisfactory answer from the government."    Phalang Tham hardliner Chaiwat Sinsuwong praised two  opposition leaders while strongly criticizing the government and  even his own party.    "I have met Chat Phattana leader Chatchai Chunhawan and Chat  Thai leader Banhan Sinlapa-acha and I was sorry I had called  them devils," Chaiwat said. "They understand us more than  Chuan. What's happening in our country? Are devils becoming  angels and vice versa -- including that damned Phalang Tham  Party? I should have died in the (1992) May crisis."    Other speakers picked on the ruling Democrat Party and Prime  Minister Chuan, calling them "liars".    A heavy downpour showered the protest site around 9 pm. The  number of demonstrators then dwindled to about 1,000.    The military and police said they were closely monitoring  the  rally, which is due to resume today in front of Parliament with  additional support from members of provincial branches of the  pressure groups.    Deputy police chief Phong-amat Amattayakun said senior  police  officers yesterday met to discuss the political situation and  prepare plans to cope with possible violence.    Initially police believed some 1,500-2,000 people would  gather yesterday. Despite the major turn-out, Pol Gen  Phong-amat said the situation would not escalate into violence.  "Many people attended the rally only because they wanted to see  At Carabao sing. They had no political motivation," he said.    Rock star At Carabao, or Yunyong Ophakun, has become a  leading crusader in the campaign for a new charter.    Deputy metropolitan police chief Somchai Wanitseni said  about  155 policemen, both plain-clothed and uniformed, were stationed  at the rally.    Army spokesman Phalangkun Klahan said intelligence officers  were monitoring the situation closely.    Chuan refused to budge amid increasing pressure, saying his  allies had reassured him that they would not submit a motion to  seek a new charter if there was no co-sponsor.    A flurry of meetings took place yesterday. After a Phalang  Tham meeting in the morning, government whips huddled to discuss  the Democrats' resolution not to bow to "political intimidation"  -- the strongest term yet to describe the campaign for  constitutional reform. It followed allegations that activist  Chalat Worachat's hunger strike had been exploited and had  snowballed into an all-out attempt to topple the government.    After the whips' meeting, coalition leaders gathered for  talks with Chuan. Their agreement to stick together was then  conveyed to another tumultuous Phalang Tham meeting.    The party reluctantly accepted the coalition's agreement,  but  as a consequence the meeting was rocked by dissent. Party leader  and Deputy Prime Minister Bunchu Rotchanasthian threatened to  resign if the coalition's deal was not accepted, while  pro-reform Phalang Tham founder Chamlong Simuang became  obviously upset, informed party sources said.    Chamlong was quoted as saying it was not right for one party  (the Democrats) to "impose its ideas" on its allies. He said he  was waiting for more details on Marut's efforts before deciding  on a new move.    Government spokesman Aphisit Wetchachiwa said the coalition  parties backtracked on an earlier compromise deal with the  pro-reform movement because "we don't want to cheat Chalad".    On Monday, the government agreed to support the formation of  a House of Representatives committee to "prepare" for the  drafting of a new constitution. It also agreed to ask the joint  House-Senate committee scrutinizing the opposition's charter  amendment package to consider an additional change which would  legitimize the promulgation of a brand new charter.    Chuan summoned key Democrat leaders to an emergency meeting  late last night.</p>

			<p><P> December 5, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WALESA'S LEAD GROWS; CHENEY GIVES SUPPORT  </P> <P> Solidarity leader Lech Walesa has widened his lead over dark-horse challenger  Stanislaw Tyminski four days before the final presidential vote, according to  an independent poll published today.  </P> <P> In another boost for Walesa, U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney met with the  Solidarity leader today in Gdansk and wished him "victory and success" in the  runoff election.  </P> <P> "I have certain political experience, and I feel that I have talked today with  the man who will win," Cheney, a former congressman, told Walesa in the  presence of reporters at the end of their 40-minute meeting at Solidarity  headquarters in Gdansk.  </P> <P> "I wish you victory and success in this difficult task," he said.  </P> <P> In the poll, 61% of those questioned supported Walesa and 20% backed Tyminski.  The remaining 19% were undecided, according to the survey conducted by the  private polling service Demoskop and commissioned by the government-owned  newspaper Rzeczpospolita.  </P> <P> An opinion poll conducted a week ago by state television put Walesa's support  at 58% and Tyminski's at 30%.  </P> <P> The poll published today was based on a survey of 988 people across the nation  and conducted on Tuesday. No margin for error was given.  </P> <P> Today, Tyminski campaign officials denied a claim made in a report on Polish  television that he had beaten his wife and refused to give food and medicine to  his children in Canada last year.  </P> <P> The charge was made in a taped interview broadcast late Tuesday by a woman  identified only as Clara Fox.  </P> <P> "The information has nothing in common with the truth," said campaign  spokeswoman Agnieska Majewska.  </P> <P> Tyminski acknowledged an acquaintance with the Foxes but said it was only  slight.  </P></p>

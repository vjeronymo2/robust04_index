			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Yeoryios Papandreou </F> by Juan M. Amoros; place and date not given]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Amoros] What is the current  state of the conflict between Greece and The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia [FYROM]?    [Papandreou] Right now there are talks under way with UN  representative Cyrus Vance to try to break the deadlock in the  negotiations and seek a solution to the problem still existing  between our countries. For the present, we have proposed a  package of measures to promote mutual trust, in which we  reexamine the name issue.    [Amoros] Of what do those measures consist?    [Papandreou] On the one hand, Skopje should offer guarantees  about the borders, as well as not using Greek symbols and  eliminating any allusion to expansionist matters. It would also  have to reinterpret some articles in its Constitution which  refer to changing the borders.    For our part, we would immediately lift the measures that we  have adopted. We would also urge that negotiations be held on  Skopje's possible entry into the European Union [EU], assist in  the implementation of joint programs with Europe and the EU, and  normalize our relations.    [Amoros] Is Greece afraid of some action by Skopje?    [Papandreou] No, really no. We are not afraid that there  could be a military confrontation. Indeed, there is no desire  for that. What we wish to say is that any border dispute, any  questioning of the borders by any of the sides, could create a  widespread conflict involving many powers.    [Amoros] What were the reasons for imposing the Thessaloniki  embargo?    [Papandreou] After two years of negotiations, we were hoping  for some sign of goodwill on Skopje's part, but we found that  Skopje was seeking the institutionalization of a de facto  situation, and its stances were increasingly firm and  inflexible. We therefore decided that there must be an immediate  reaction, and that is why the embargo on using the port of  Thessaloniki was decreed.    [Amoros] And what has been the effect of these sanctions?    [Papandreou] I am not very sure what the effect of these  sanctions has been, but we can see that there is again some  movement concerning the negotiations, and we hope that this will  lead to progress in resolving the matter.    [Amoros] How does Athens assess the EU's harsh reaction to  these sanctions?    [Papandreou] The Balkans is an area of Europe in which  Greece believes that stability is essential, and so it must be  ensured that all countries understand this. Greece wishes to  convey the message that stability in the Balkans is essential  for the stability of the whole of Europe, and that is something  that not all countries have been able to grasp.    [Amoros] And if the sanctions fail?    [Papandreou] Well, for the present we are optimistic because  the negotiations are beginning to move again. We hope for new  results from Cyrus Vance's mediation, and believe that this time  there will be a satisfactory final solution.</p>

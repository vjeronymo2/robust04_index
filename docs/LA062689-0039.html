			<p><P> June 26, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition;  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'ROMEO AND JULIET' A PLAY WITH 2 TELLINGS  </P> <P> Comparisons in theater aren't odious: They're enlightening. Consider the two  productions of "Romeo and Juliet" that opened over the weekend, one in San  Diego and one in Garden Grove. Each is an outdoor staging and each takes a  traditional approach to the material. But, oh, what a difference.  </P> <P> At the Old Globe Theatre (director: Richard E. T. White), we get a respectful  mounting of a "great play." At the Grove Shakespeare Festival (director: Jules  Aaron), we get an urgent telling of a wonderful story.  </P> <P> The first difference is the design. At the Old Globe, the idea is to give us a  picture of a real Italian square at high noon -- which, with a pull of a  curtain, can become a real balcony at midnight. It is, as they say, as good as  a movie. (Steven Rubin designed both the settings and costumes, and Robert  Peterson did the painterly lighting.)  </P> <P> Compare the paltry look of the Garden Grove production: the unfurnished set (by  D. Martyn Bookwalter), the flimsy costumes (by Dwight Richard Odle), the  generalized lighting (by David Palmer). Aside from the odd central element used  for Juliet's balcony -- it looks like a corkscrew crossed with a crow's nest --  there's nothing to look at but the actors.  </P> <P> Which means that the actors can't consider themselves figures in a landscape.  They have to come out and sell the play. And they do. This isn't the subtlest  production of "Romeo and Juliet" that you'll ever see, but it's in touch with  the play's energy sources in a way that the San Diego production isn't. All the  play's channels are open, not just the woeful ones.  </P> <P> That's ironic, because it's the San Diego production that works harder at the  details: at suggesting that Juliet's parents (Mike Genovese and Ellen Crawford)  haven't slept together for years, for example, or that Romeo's cousin Benvolio  (Albert Farrar) isn't much of a swordsman.  </P> <P> Time gets lost in these little touches, however. The Garden Grove production  makes its own points but makes them on the wing. When Friar Laurence (Harry  Woolf) says farewell to Romeo (David Anthony Smith), a slight pause before his  last "goodby" is enough to convey how much he's going to miss him. The idea is  to convey the suddenness of love and death, not to linger on subsidiary  insights.  </P> <P> The play therefore seems much shorter and more clearly focused than in San  Diego, although its running time is only 15 minutes less. Tempo isn't the only  reason. Aaron's cast bites into the text with appreciation, as if they would  rather be speaking Shakespeare than anything else. White's San Diego actors  speak correctly, but they don't celebrate the language. Only Ken Ruta (Friar  Laurence) and Mitchell Edmonds (Montague) account for every single word.  </P> <P> At the center of the play are Romeo and Juliet. In San Diego, Jon Tenney makes  a good beginning, but doesn't sufficiently distinguish between the character's  early lovesickness for Rosaline (Martha Perantoni) and his later bonding with  Juliet. He needs to go deeper, while Monique Fowler needs to explore Juliet's  vivacity, temper and intelligence. The major theme of her performance at the  moment is that Juliet is suffering from emotions too large to be expressed.  This is the way poignancy is conveyed on the soaps. It won't do for three  hours.  </P> <P> Compare Susan Doupe's Juliet at Garden Grove, a delicate girl who believes in  seizing the moment. She is eager to love, both because Romeo (David Anthony  Smith) has captured her heart and because it's something of a prank of her  parents (Larry Franklin and Pam Fisher). And in the tomb scene she is ready to  die. Without lacking lyricism, this Juliet avoids the customary mooning around.  She knows exactly what she's feeling.  </P> <P> Smith's Romeo may be a bit of a twit, but he does suggest a young aristocrat,  well trained at the fencing academy, and a man of feeling. He's sincerely  concerned when Mercutio (John Walcutt) gets so carried away with his language  that he almost falls into a fit. (Michael Cerveris' Mercutio at the Old Globe  keeps both feet on the ground at all times.) This Romeo cares, and we can care  with him.  </P> <P> In short, the play works at one venue, and works much less well at the other.  Leaving the Old Globe, you wonder if you haven't seen it too often. Leaving the  Grove, it's a new play again, filled with possibilities. Shakespeare is a  genius or a drone, depending on his helpers.  </P> <P>  Plays at Garden Grove Thursdays through Sundays at 8:30 p.m. Closes July 15.  12852 Main St. (714) 636-7213.  </P> <P>  Plays at San Diego Tuesdays through Sundays at 8:30 p.m. Closes July 30.

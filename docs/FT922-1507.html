			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / Industrial demand up in W Midlands WEST MIDLANDS engineering companies have reported a rise in the number of orders received over the past three months, with domestic demand growing more strongly than export demand. The performance of these companies is often seen as a barometer of British manufacturing industry. The west Midlands branch of the Engineering Employers' Federation says in its latest quarterly survey that 46 per cent of its member companies had an improved order position in May, compared with 34 per cent in February. The proportion of companies experiencing a decline in orders dropped from 37 per cent to to 25 per cent over the same period. Mr David Botterill, the branch's chief executive, said the results were 'most encouraging' but added: 'It must always be remembered that these improvements are from a very low base' and that 'there is still a long way to go before we can say that the recession is over'.</p>

			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / International Company News: Alcatel Alsthom rises 20% to FFr3.1bn ALCATEL Alsthom, the French telecommunications and engineering group, yesterday reported a 20 per cent rise in first-half net profits, mainly due to exceptional gains, and forecast higher earnings for the year as a whole. Net income climbed to FFr3.1bn (Dollars 615m) in the first six months of this year, from FFr2.6bn in the same period of 1991, on sales up by 6 per cent to FFr79.47bn. Most of the rise in net income was due to a FFr437m capital gain on the sale of Treasury stock. Operating profits fell by 3 per cent to FFr6.34bn. On average, Alcatel Alsthom's subsidiaries produced a 5 per cent net return on turnover, the company said. Fully diluted earnings per share rose by 8 per cent over the period to FFr24.70.</p>

			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> LAWNDALE CUTS BUDGET; NO LAYOFFS MADE YET  </P> <P> The Lawndale City Council has cut a variety of expenditures from the city's  proposed $7.8-million budget for 1989-90, but has not eliminated any jobs yet.  </P> <P> Six employees have been targeted for layoffs as the council seeks to trim more  than $400,000 to pay for increased Sheriff's Department services. At its first  two budget workshops last week, however, the council instead cut the budgets of  the six departments studied so far, Mayor Sarann Kruse said.  </P> <P> The council's next budget workshop will be held at 7 p.m. Tuesday at City Hall,  14717 Burin Ave. A public hearing on the budget has been scheduled for 7 p.m.  June 19, also at City Hall.  </P></p>

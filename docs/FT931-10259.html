			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Dworkin to quit Storehouse for US MR DAVID Dworkin, chief executive of Storehouse, is leaving the retailing group to become chief executive of Carter Hawley Hale Stores, one of the largest fashion retailers in the US. Storehouse, which includes the BhS and Mothercare chains, was expected to make an announcement today about the future of Mr Dworkin - who is widely credited with having turned the group around - after its shares fell 11p to 194p on rumours that he was about to resign. But Carter Hawley Hale announced last night that Mr Dworkin was to take over from Mr Philip Hawley as president and chief executive officer from April 1. Mr Samuel Zell, general partner of Zell/Chilmark Fund, CHH's principal owner, said Mr Dworkin's appointment was a 'tremendously significant and exciting development for CHH. David Dworkin is a proven star in the retailing industry.' Mr Dworkin, a 49-year-old American born in Cleveland, Ohio, was recruited to head the BhS group in November 1989 from Bonwit Teller, the US department stores group. Analysts and industry insiders said the challenge at Carter Hawley - a successful retailer in the 1980s which had problems controlling its debt and emerged last October from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection - would be just the sort Mr Dworkin would relish, having laid the foundations for recovery at Storehouse. Pre-tax profits at Storehouse increased from Pounds 1.3m in 1990 to Pounds 15.8m last year, and are forecast to reach around Pounds 20m this year. Mr Dworkin has reduced the size of the business, selling off Habitat and Richards, and focusing the group on BhS and Mothercare. Management reforms, a revamp of the stores' image and products and better use of space and computers, have all contributed to a consistent increase in sales and margins at BhS over the last 15 months. Although the City reacted badly to rumours of Mr Dworkin's departure, analysts said this would not be disastrous as he had already taken all the fundamental steps required. There is no obvious successor within Storehouse, and the group is expected to look outside for a replacement.</p>

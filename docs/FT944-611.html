			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Books: The myth behind those merrie men - The legend of the quintessential outlaw, Robin Hood ROBIN HOOD by Stephen Knight Blackwell Pounds 45, 308 pages Robin Hood is a fixture in the consciousness of the English-speaking world. By a kind of Pavlovian reflex the name prompts images of Errol Flynn or - a good deal less convincingly, because he always looked uncomfortable and faintly surprised in his tights - television's Richard Greene. Just how long, and in how many ways, this bow-twanging merrie man of the greenwood has been haunting our collective imaginations is astonishing. The whole story, myth and fact alike, is thoroughly explored by Stephen Knight in this new study. One of the great questions about Robin Hood is: was there actually such a man? According to the 'empiricists' there was, and according to the 'mythicists' there was not. In the marvellously absorbing way of these things - historical detective work beats the fictional variety by a million miles - the answer turns out to be that there were many Robin Hoods, most of whom were named so after the really real Robin Hood - viz. the mythical one  -to mark their outlaw status. Or so Stephen Knight suggests, for, after a judicious examination of the arguments, he comes down on the side of the 'mythicists' . Robin Hood is an emblem of liberty, anti-authoritarianism, and natural justice. He robs the rich to pay the poor; he outwits the sheriff and his men; and lives the rural idyll with his happy band of companions (and, later, Maid Marion). In earlier sources - chronicles, ballads and the 'performances' which were the forerunners of theatre - Robin is an outlaw, sometimes even a 'cut-throat'. But by the 17th century he had been gentrified: he had become the Earl of Huntington, dispossessed of his property by a usurping king, and in revolt not against genuine authority in the form of the absent Good King Richard, but against the treasonous tyrant Bad King John. Thus was his outlawry made legitimate, and the outlaw himself transformed into a suitably aristocratic hero. It is this good outlaw of noble birth who, along with his accretions of Little John, Friar Tuck and Maid Marion, gives us the romantic and Hollywood Robin we all know. Robin Hood is now associated with Sherwood Forest or with Barnsdale (Knight shows that this must be the Rutland, not the Yorkshire, Barnsdale), but in the 14th century, when the legend was beginning to flourish - it reached its apogee in the 16th century - any number of localities from the West Country to Scotland laid claim to him. There are assorted Robin Hood Fields, Robin Hood Crosses and Robin Hood Caves, and the ballad and chronicle sources have him popping up in all sorts of localities. This multiplicity of place is echoed in the multiple nature of the legend in its sources; which is why Knight concludes that the Robin Hood story is mythic. Perhaps it became popular because it struck a chord among people who for three centuries had been living under foreign lords - the Normans - and were only just beginning to regain an identity. In the year 1213 or sometime soon after, one Robin Hood, servant to the Abbot of Cirencester, slew a man called Ralph. Fifteen years later a fugitive called Robert Hood was being sought in Yorkshire. In 1262 another fugitive called William Hobehod is recorded. At the beginning of the 14th century the surname 'Robynhod' appears in Sussex. In 1354 a man called Robin Hood was held for trial in a prison in Rockingham Forest. And so on: intriguing intimations - the 'empiricists' say, glimpses - of something at the root of legend. Knight provides a chronology of references to Robin Hood between the 13th and 17th centuries, and they show how the legend grew, suggesting that the name Robin Hood came to stand as a pseudonym for any outlaw, whether his real name was known or not. In some of the earliest chronicles reference is made to the popularity of Robin Hood among ordinary people. He became a favourite figure in performances at fairs and festivals, often associated with Whitsun. The gentrification of Robin from the 17th century onwards can be seen as a characteristic English response to anything potentially threatening, as a symbol of resistance to authority must always be: it neuters him by domesticating him, transforming him into a safe figure who is not against the establishment, but a true defender of it: and thus a worthy hero after all. Knight is as fascinating on recent Robin as he is on medieval Robin. Films, cartoons, musicals and books have kept the outlaw firmly in popular consciousness - as witness the fact that five Robin Hood films were made before 1914. All these representations, Knight shows, were reinventions; yet at the same time the majority of them preserved the kernel of the myth as it had settled after 1600 - the gentrified Robin, the Robin of merrie men and true justice. Perhaps, in an otherwise unbelieving age, such myths have their place.</p>

			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Observer: Craving grace Grace before lunch took a somewhat unconventional form at the Detroit Economic Club's celebration of this weekend's opening of the city's motor show. The club chaplain began the proceedings with a short prayer for increased production and profits. It proved an apt appetiser for a fighting speech by Chrysler chairman Lee Iacocca, fresh off the plane from Tokyo, urging protection for the US motor industry, which won him a standing ovation. 'Hell, I didn't go to Japan to help open the rice market. The last time I looked, we don't grow any rice in Detroit,' declared the head of the smallest of America's big three car-makers. 'When Detroit gets stiffed on autos, then America gets stiffed on trade - period,' he went on. 'That's because cars are America's rice. Any argument for protecting Japan's rice farmers is an argument for completely shutting Japan out of our auto market.' Even so, he did not want to go quite that far. 'I'm really a free trader. The thing I want to protect is free trade. And the way you do that is to retaliate against those who don't believe in it. And if there's anyone here who thinks Japan practises free trade, I've got some S&amp;L's I'd like to sell you.' There were no takers.</p>

What it offers to European states is cooperation in  the military and political spheres. This is what Foreign  Minister Josef Zieleniec said on television. Asked about the  schedule for the Czech Republic joining NATO, the minister  replied:    [Begin Zieleniec recording] It much depends on the general  development of the security situation in the world. I think that  a tacit part of the agreement is that the plan will acquire  greater dynamism in the event that the situation on the  continent and also in East Europe deteriorates. On the other  hand, if developments proceed along the lines of peace and calm  and if they are heading toward democracy in all East and Central  European states, there could be some delay. But, in that case,  there would be no risk to our security. [end recording].    Josef Zieleniec went on to emphasize that the meaning of  NATO  is the provision of joint guarantees for a larger entity sharing  similar interests, values, and way of life.    The immediate opening of NATO toward the deep east and  embracing states where democracy--and I quote--is not fully  convincing, would be very risky, Minister Zieleniec said.</p>

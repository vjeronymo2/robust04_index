Razumov, </F> RF VTsUZh deputy director: "Standard of Living for Russia and  Its Regions"]    [Text] The problem of the standard of living under  conditions of radical transformations is at the center of  society's attention. In complex scientific studies by the  All-Russian Center for the Standard of Living [VTsUZh] under the  Russian Federation [RF] Ministry of Labor, official statistics  based on data from the RF Goskomstat (State Committee for  Statistics) have been used along with the VTsUZh's own  calculations, which are based on original methods that make it  possible to obtain comparative estimates of the level and  dynamics of real incomes and personal consumption for Russia's  regions. The VTsUZh is also conducting selective sociological  research among the population in order to determine the  connections between the level of material provision of the  members of the families studied, on the one hand, and their  status (employment, behavioral motivation, and so on) in the  labor market, on the other.    The standard of living represents the degree of development  and satisfaction of needs for the individual living in a  society. In accordance with Article 25 of the ILO Convention "On  the Basic Goals and Norms of Social Policy" No. 117, an  individual has the right to the standard of living, including  food, clothing, housing, medical care, and social services,  necessary to maintain his own health and well-being and that of  his family, as well as the right to provision in the event of  unemployment, disability, widowhood, or other instance of the  loss of the funds for existence due to circumstances beyond his  control. According to a U.N. recommendation, the standard of  living is measured by a system of indicators characterizing  health, consumption level, employment, education, housing, and  social provision.    The most general measure of a population's standard of  living  is its real income as a monetary measure of all goods received  in the course of a given period on a per capita basis. With  inflationary processes, the necessity arises to assess these  incomes, and above all salary, according to their purchasing  capacity, i.e., corrected for the price index.    Real monetary income for the Russian population at the end  of  1992 was 96.4 rubles [R] (in 1983 prices) per capita per month.  Analysis of the dynamics of real monetary income for Russia as a  whole for the period 1992 to July 1993 attests to their  vacillating nature due to the time lag between the dynamic of  monetary income for the population and the dynamic of prices.  According to our calculations, real monetary income for the  Russian Federation in the third quarter of 1993 was less than  two-fifths of what it was in the fourth quarter of 1991.    One reason for this level of real monetary income lies in  the  fact that minimum levels for wages, pensions, stipends,  subsidies, and other social outlays have been reviewed  quarterly, resulting in a substantial lag behind price rises.  With the increase in inflation, this has led to a growth in  poverty.    We see an obvious rift between the tendency of prices to  approach the world level and the relative devaluation of Russian  manpower. The lack of development of the labor market and the  absence of objective price setting, including for manpower,  encourage a specific and growing portion of the population to  engage in activities in economically and socially ineffective  spheres (the shadow economy, speculation, resale, and so forth).  New strata of the population are being formed, including  entrepreneurs, with high and super-high monetary incomes. On the  other hand, the portion of the population doomed to poverty or  at best to a low material sufficiency is mounting.    The extremely difficult situation with real monetary incomes  is partially alleviated by in-kind incomes and free services. At  the present stage of the reforms, incomes are growing as a  result of people holding more than one job or working private  plots, as well as engaging in individual activity. From 1985 to  1992, gross output from private plots increased in comparable  1983 prices by a factor of 1.4, and their proportionate share in  gross output for all of Russia's agricultural output for the  same period increased by 23-33 percent.    For the most part, free state services for health care,  education, and housing have been maintained. Taking into  consideration both the fact that the population obtains some of  its goods as a hedge against future higher prices, and  nonmonetary income, real income for the population as a whole in  recent years declined from R138 per capita per month in 1991 on  average by a factor of about 1.5, a decline that affected  primarily the less well-off part of the population.    The decline in real income has been expressed in the fact  that in 1992 the population began to consume the most important  food products and to buy nonfood goods to a significantly lesser  extent than in 1990: consumption of meat and meat products fell  from 68 kg to 58 kg per year; meat and dairy products from 386  kg to 295 kg; eggs from 296 to 256; sugar from 47.2 kg to 33.6  kg; vegetable oil from 10.0 kg to 6.5 kg; vegetables, melons,  and gourds from 89 kg to 83 kg; and fruits and berries from 35  kg to 33 kg. Only the consumption of potatoes and grain products  rose slightly, reaching 119 kg and 122 kg per capita per year,  respectively. Fabric consumption for this period fell from 39.14  to 22.0 square meters, and shoes from 3.27 to 2.16 pairs per  capita per year.    At the present time, what is advancing ever more sharply to  the fore is the task of studying the influence of the transition  to a market economy on the standard of living in the various  territory-subjects of the Russian Federation and the  possibilities of comparing individual regions for standard of  living achieved and its dynamic. In order to address this task,  the VTsUZh is monitoring incomes and consumption for the regions  of the RF.    The dynamic of real incomes and personal consumption differs  substantially for individual regions. These indicators are  dropping most quickly in the Severo-Kavkazskiy and Tsentralnyi  and Severo-Zapadnyi regions. Matters are slightly better in the  Tsentralno-Chernozemnyy and Povolzhskiy regions, where the level  of self-provision of consumer goods has always been relatively  high, as well as in the Uralskiy and Volgo-Vyatskiy regions,  that is, the regions where defense complex branches are  concentrated and where the level of consumption is being  supported by the state at the present time.    The Tsentralnyy region has ceded first place for level of  per  capita consumption to the Dalnevostochnyy region. The average  Russian level of per capita consumption for the Povolzhskiy and  Severnyy regions has begun to rise tangibly. Meanwhile, the  Zapadno-Sibirskiy and Vostochno-Sibirskiy regions, where  previously the per capita consumption corresponded more or less  to the average Russian level, have begun to lag behind it.    We think that the subjects of the Russian Federation as well  as the central economic organs would be interested in obtaining  and utilizing this information in order to develop and fine-tune  their own measures for implementing the social policy being  carried out on the territorial level.    To assess citizens' standard of living, the concept of a  "minimum consumption budget" (MPB) is used. The MPB is  calculated to provide for the full satisfaction of a person's  reasonable requirements. The BPM (minimum subsistence budget)  ensures the basic conditions for life at this stage in society's  development so as to maintain both people's ability to work and  their health.    The BPM envisages average per capita consumption as follows:  grain products 130.8 kg per year; potatoes 124.2; vegetables  94.0; fruits and berries 19.4; sugar 20.7, meat products 26.6,  fish products 11.7; dairy products 212.4; vegetable oil and  margarine 10 kg per year; and 151 eggs. The food basket used in  calculating the subsistence minimum was developed by specialists  at the Nutrition Institute of the Russian Academy of Medical  Sciences. In accordance with their recommendations, the daily  caloric value of foods included in the BPM comprises at least  2720.4 calories for working-age men, 2138.4 calories for  working-age women, 1976.6 calories for pensioners, 1581.6  calories for children under 6 years of age, and 2385.6 calories  for youths ages 7-15, or 2236.7 calories on average. The food  basket underwent expert analysis in the World Health  Organization and received a positive evaluation. The structure  of the BPM includes, apart from expenditures for food,  expenditures for nonfood goods, services, taxes, and other  mandatory outlays.    The minimum subsistence level varies according to regional  characteristics in its monetary expression as well. Thus, its  highest amount was in the Dalnevostochnyy region (R58,237 in  October 1993), in Khanta-Mansiyskiy Autonomous Okrug (R87,244),  and in Amurskaya Oblast (R69,126); its lowest was in the  Tsentralno-Chernozemnyy regions of Russia (R18,864), the  Republic of Tatarstan (R15,815), the Republic of Karelia  (R10,970), and Rostovskaya Oblast (R17,123).    If we compare conditions of current minimum-level  consumption  in October and with July, we discover the following tendencies.  The minimum cost of life declined in comparison with the average  Russian level in the Severo-Zapadnyy, Volgo-Vyatskiy,  Tsentralno-Chernozemnyy, Povolzhskiy, and Uralskiy regions. It  increased, and quite noticeably, in the Vostochno-Sibirskiy,  Zapadno-Sibirskiy, and Dalnevostochnyy regions. In the remaining  areas the correlation between the monetary assessment of minimum  requirements and the average Russian level remained virtually  unchanged.    Contemporary reforms have significantly intensified the  differentiation in the population by level of income and  consumption. Usually for these indicators the 10 percent  worst-off and best-off portions of the population are compared.  According to data from budgetary research, in October 1993, the  average level of monetary per capita income among the 10 percent  best-off exceeded the corresponding level among the 10 percent  worst-off by a factor of 6. Within a year, the degree of  differentiation had nearly doubled. In October 1993, the share  of income among the 10 percent best-off in the total income fund  comprised 19.3 percent, whereas the share of the 10 percent  worst-off in the total income fund comprised 3.2 percent.    The data cited above must be evaluated critically, since  budgetary statistics do not reflect sufficiently fully all  strata of the population. The most well-provided, rich families  get left out and thus the proportion of poor in the total  numbers is greatly exaggerated.    The VTsUZh differentiates the population by level of income  and consumption in relation to consumption budgets. It has  distinguished five population groups with various levels of  material provision:    --group I are the "poor" families, whose per capita income  is  less than or equal to the cost assessment of the minimum  subsistence budget;    --group II are the "low-income" families, whose per capita  income falls between the cost assessment of the minimum  subsistence budget and the cost assessment of the minimum  consumption budget;    --group III are the "middle-income" families, whose per  capita income falls between the cost assessment of one and two  MPBs (or varies around the average budget);    --group IV are the "well-off" families, whose per capita  income falls between double the MPB (or the average budget) and  the per capita income level (or reasonable consumption budget)  that conventionally characterizes "rich" families; and    --group V are the "rich" families, whose per capita income  is  higher than the income conventionally characterizing "rich"  families (or the reasonable consumption budget) and is defined  by differentiated budgets (as of July 1993 this was accepted as  being over R150,000 per family member).    According to data from selective research, in July of this  year, poor families made up 32 percent of the population,  low-income 41 percent, middle-income 20 percent, well-off 5.5  percent, and 1.5 percent of the population lived in rich  families. Special research indicates that the breaking down into  extreme groups for per capita income levels is mounting at an  increasing rate. In 1993, the incomes of "rich" families (group  V) exceeded the per capita incomes of poor families (group I) by  a factor of as much as 30.    In world practice, the proportion of income used for food in  the family budget is used as a general indicator for standard of  living: the lower this proportion, the higher the standard of  living. Selective research by the VTsUZh indicates that in the  middle of this year for the 14 percent worst-off in the  population, the share of expenditures for food in the budgets of  their families was over 83.1 percent, for 31 percent 67.1-81.3  percent, for 34 percent 44.1-67.0 percent, and for 14 percent  23.0-44.0 percent. For the 8 percent best-off, the proportionate  weight of expenses for food in families' budgets came to less  than 23 percent.    As analysis indicates, the poor include the greatest degree  of broken families. Families with many children find themselves  in the most difficult material position, up to 60 percent of  them being concentrated in group I. Refugees and migrants, up to  three quarters of whom fall into the category of poor families,  are in an especially difficult situation.    The level of family income rises in direct proportion to how  much of that income is in the form of wages. The highest level  and proportionate weight of wages in rich families is determined  by additional employment. In these families, income from  cooperative enterprises and from other labor activity comprises  up to 30 percent of all sources of income, or about 30 times  more than the corresponding income in poor families. Poor  families are characterized by a higher proportion of income in  the form of pensions, subsidies, and stipends. The proportionate  weight of these incomes nonetheless declined in poor families by  comparison with the initial period of reform in 1992.    Among the poor able-bodied population, the proportionate  weight of those working in state and municipal enterprises is  approximately twice as high. At the same time, up to 40 percent  of all those working from the rich income group work in  individual (family) and private enterprises, while among the  poor able-bodied population this indicator is 20 times or more  lower. Among the rich, income from shares and other forms of  property (other than private plots) reaches up to 10 percent of  the total volume of income, while among the poor this income  does not exceed 1.5 percent. As income rises, the commercial  orientation of the private plot is increasingly manifested. If  in poor families the overwhelming mass of output is used for  personal consumption, in well-off and rich families up to 50  percent of all net output from private plots is sold.    Poor families have been most affected by unemployment.  Analysis indicates that up to half of those individuals who are  able-bodied and who receive an unemployment subsidy are  concentrated in poor families.    Among poor families, the proportionate weight of the  non-able-bodied is significantly higher than among rich  families. According to VTsUZh assessments, at present more than  two-fifths of the members of poor families are children or  individuals older than working age. In rich families these  social-demographic groups comprise about one-sixth. In several  regions up to 40 percent and more of all children live in poor  families. Among the dependents in these families, mothers  raising young children are represented significantly more often  than in others.    In social programs to support the standard of living, it  obviously makes sense to separate out the following blocs:    --measures to provide guarantees to all population groups  and  strata (minimum social norms: salaries, pensions, stipends,  other social payments, taking into consideration socioeconomic  conditions in the regions; ecological conditions of survival,  safety, and others);    --measures for the social support of the able-bodied  population (above all, the creation of conditions for the  independent resolution of the problem of raising their families'  standard of living);    --measures for targeted social protection of the  non-able-bodied population, measures to protect citizens who  find themselves in difficult life situations, and marginal  population groups; as well as resource, information, and  organizational provision for the program.    Such a structure for this type of social program makes it  possible to isolate the most severe social problems, to lend a  systematic nature to all envisaged measures, and to take into  account specific local features.    As a result, we can expect an increase in the efficiency of  social policy and the approach of a turning point for  inauspicious tendencies in the socioeconomic status of Russia's  population.</p>

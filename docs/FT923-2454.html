			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Arts: Today's Television The programme listings should have a stock of logos saying 'OLD]', then when all those familiar series return for the autumn season they could be given accurate labels instead of 'NEW' claims. Among the well worn series reappearing today are Taggart (9.00 ITV) with the glum little Scottish detective played, as ever, by Mark McManus. BBC1 brings back one of British television's earlier and most highly rated examples of tabloid television, Crimewatch UK. Like Dickens' Fat Boy this sets out to make our flesh creep with tales of 'orrible murder and then, unlike the Fat Boy, grinningly instructs us not to have nightmares. That is followed by another old series, Question Time (10.15). It is as well to have some form of extra-parliamentary forum on television to discuss current politics, but this programme has never been the same since Robin Day left. BBC2's fascinating series The Climbers (8.00) ends with Chris Bonington considering the modern phenomenon of superfast climbers who, in a few hours, race to summits which once took days for large expeditions. Has mountaineering turned into a stunt?</p>

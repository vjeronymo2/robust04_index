			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Sir John, the Letts family and the Troubleshooter programme Sir, James Buxton's article, 'Go away Sir John' (November 11), is so imprecise in a number of details that he is more likely to encourage the return of Sir John Harvey-Jones than to send him away. 1. Sir John was not called in by the Letts family. The BBC approached the company to ask whether they could include Letts in the second series of the Troubleshooter programme and after some deliberation the board agreed. 2. The rent in the Battersea office was not Pounds 1m but about one third of this figure. 3. Sir John did not propose a diversification into business gifts but rather approved a course already adopted. 4. The paragraph about the roles of the Letts directors is misleading. Martin and Timothy Letts had agreed to retire well before the refinancing, and my responsibilities as chairman were formulated prior to the appointment of a chief executive. When assessing the contribution of the Troubleshooter programme it should be borne in mind that the series was primarily intended to provide an entertaining and lively approach to business. Proposals inevitably were over-simplified and presented in a provocative manner. The main weakness of this approach was that it could not put across many of the changes taking place at that time. A particular example of this was the modest investment in a constraint related production control system which yielded significant productivity gains and enabled management to control the plant during the seasonal peak activity. The unsung heroes of the turnround are those who have put in many extra hours over the past two years to bring into effect a host of improvements at low investment cost.

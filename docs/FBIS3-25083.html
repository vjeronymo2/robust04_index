The CFA franc was devalued by 50  percent after a summit meeting in Dakar on January 11 following  pressure from the International Monetary Fund. The move led to  wide-spread panic immediately after it came into effect in  several of the 14 member states of the Franc Zone. But Ivory  Coast Prime Minister Daniel Kablan Duncan said Monday that the  13 heads of state present for the meeting "trusted in the  operation." "They believe it is an opportunity to emerge from  crisis and to reach a level of economic growth."    The meeting also addressed the consequences of the  devaluation, especially rising prices and the problem of debt,  calling for France to provide more aid. French Prime Minister  Edouard Balladur in a brief statement at the airport here said  the meeting had ended on a "note of realism and optimism." He  added the devaluation was not the end but a beginning.    After the January summit, France promised to put forward  proposals to alleviate the debts still owed by the member  countries. The mini-summit was held following the funeral of the  Ivorian president Felix Houphouet-Boigny, who was given a  sumptuous send-off Monday.</p>

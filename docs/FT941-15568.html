			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Survey of Drax - The Big Clean-up (2): Celebrations after a difficult year - The Contractors Last month, Babcock Energy formally handed over to National Power the first two of six sulphur dioxide absorber towers and associated plant which it is building at the Drax power station on an eight-year Pounds 400m-plus contract. After a difficult year at Drax for the subsidiary of Babcock International, it was a time for celebration - tinged with feelings of relief. According to Dr John Parker, chief executive and deputy chairman of the engineering contractor, the completion of the first phase of the project was 'a major technological and operational achievement for both Babcock and National Power and is the culmination of five years work on the contract to ensure completion on time and to specification.' Work on the remaining four units was proceeding to plan, said Babcock, and more than 75 per cent of the contract had been carried out. The final pair of absorbers would be handed over to National Power on the scheduled contract dates in the spring of 1996. The handover in December came only three months after Babcock had revealed that it would be taking a Pounds 15m pre-tax provision to cover higher-than-expected costs on the contract - along with a further Pounds 5m provision to cover costs of closing non-core mining activities in Africa. The news shocked the City of London, caused a 20 per cent overnight fall in Babcock's share price and once again underlined the risks inherent in large-scale engineering contracts. Babcock's problems at Drax have, perhaps inevitably, overshadowed its achievements on the contract and those of other suppliers and contractors. The scale of the project, with 85km of pipework, 29,000 tons of steelwork, and large ductwork assemblies which were moved around on the equivalent of roller skates before being lifted into position, has produced some significant construction achievements. Building the FGD plant required the sinking of 14,000 piles into ground close to the operating plant. For, apart from some temporary interruptions, Drax has been continuing to produce power - which has been very important to the customer. 'The ability of the construction team to build the FGD plant while reducing the impact on our biggest revenue-earner has been masterful,' says Mr Granville Camsey, National Power's executive director with overall responsibility for the Drax project. Overall, the project is running on time and under budget. The original estimate was Pounds 750m, Mr Camsey says, but the eventual total cost will be about Pounds 680m. Apart from Babcock Energy, National Power has had about 50 main contractors on site. Of them, the largest amount of work went to Birtley Engineering, which won Pounds 30m of contracts to supply the materials handling system and a waste water treatment plant. It is followed by Mowlem Civil Engineering, which did Pounds 19.5m of piling, unit plant and ductwork foundations, Amec Civil Engineering (Pounds 19m of work on common plant foundations), Alfred McAlpine (Pounds 12m of preliminary civil works), and W. S. Atkins (a Pounds 9m civil design consultancy contract). Babcock Energy itself has also given work worth more than Pounds 1m apiece to more than than 30 sub-contractors. By far the biggest contract, worth about Pounds 45m, went to Cleveland Structural Engineering for all the structural steelwork and cladding. Howden Sirocco won a Pounds 22m contract for gas heaters and booster fans, while contracts of about Pounds 15m each went to Plastilon of France for the glass reinforced plastic (GRP) pipework, Balfour Kilpatrick for cabling and Ancorite for the absorber and flue linings. Thompson Kennicott, part of Rolls-Royce, provided waste water treatment plant in a deal worth about Pounds 10m. Other household names from construction and engineering include M. J. Gleeson, GEC Alsthom, Weir Pumps and Asea Brown Boveri. ABB had control system contracts from both Babcock Energy and National Power itself, worth a total of about Pounds 10m. Overall, the bulk of the spending on the project has been in the UK - National Power estimates that only about Pounds 45m of work was supplied from overseas. At its peak, about 2,300 people were employed on site, but the overall employment effect for such projects is normally between three and five times that number - if steelmakers, transporters and others even remotely involved are included. For many of the suppliers, and especially Babcock itself, the Drax FGD project has been one of their first experiences of the way the privatised utilities are handling very big capital investments. In contrast to the highly-detailed technical design work which used to be carried out by the old Central Electricity Generating Board, National Power gave Babcock a performance specification it must work to but very little technical definition. This is a fundamental change, says Mr Camsey, from what contractors and customers are used to. The relationship between the two is now based around performance-related criteria. National Power, for example laid down what it wanted in terms of performance and durability from the project's pipework, but did not say what it should be made of. In consultation with the customer, Babcock decided on using GRP for 80 per cent of the pipework rather than rubber-lined steel. Babcock also decided to line the mild steel ductwork with a nickel-based material, Hastalloy, to meet performance criteria there. This method of construction clearly requires a high degree of trust between customer and supplier but also needs a mechanism than enables both to spot problems early and take action accordingly. Leaving aside the relatively minor problem of a fire at one of Plastilon's plants, the big problem has been at the heart of the FGD process itself. The massive steel absorbers have to be lined with rubber to prevent corrosion, but in August 1992 imperfections in the steel plate were discovered after shotblasting, says Mr Keith Thorley, Babcock Energy's project manager at Drax. Consequently, reaching the required level of smoothness and cleanliness for the linings to stick properly proved to be much more difficult than had first been thought. Part of the problem was the specification of the steel plate itself, says Mr William Fairney, National Power's director of project development and construction. The original plate was supplied from the UK, but Babcock says that for the later units it is switching to steel from a Belgium supplier which was able to give guarantees on imperfection-free plate. The technical problem in the absorbers was solved by Christmas 1992, but 20 weeks had been lost. National Power could see that Babcock would not be able to complete the first two absorbers by December 1993 without considerable additional manpower to catch up with its schedule. 'We sat down with them to look at the problem,' says Mr Camsey. 'They realised they had to bring in more people.' This was the origin of Babcock's cost overrun - which emerged in the summer after an independent team from Babcock head office found a Pounds 15m gap between expected future revenue on the contract and predicted costs. Babcock's management team on site has been strengthened and top-level oversight of the project tightened up through appointment of a director dedicated to the project. Mr Camsey says there has been some tough talking between contractor and customer, and even some 'blood-letting.' But he adds that, overall 'in a technical and a project management sense, Babcock have been good, and we are satisfied.' The handover of the first two absorbers was made a day before the December 17 deadline. Mr Fairney adds that Babcock must be given credit for the way it handled three 12-week outages (utility-speak for stopping production) for the critical installation of the ductwork into the flues. It finished the first with two days to spare, the second with seven days, and the third with 11 days to spare. Both contractor and customer are now confident that the four remaining absorbers will go ahead without further technical problems after the lessons learnt on the first pair. The two sides will probably continue discussing terms until the contract is completed and Babcock said in September it was in talks with National Power about recovery of 'certain elements' of the additional costs. Whether it achieves that remains to be seen - Mr Camsey says 'No comment.'</p>

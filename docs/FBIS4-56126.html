			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Evgeniya Drumeva] </F>   [Excerpts] Sofia, May 26 (BTA) -- Bulgarian journalism has  turned 150 years. It emerged in 1844 with the coming out of the  Lyuboslovie journal of Renaissance man Konstantin Fotinov,  published in Bulgarian while this country was still under  Ottoman oppression. [passage omitted]    Today, four years after the outset of the democratic changes  in this country, politicians are unanimous that the press and  speech now enjoy the freedom they have a right to. Last year  saw over 800 periodicals which circulated a total of 600,000 to  700,000 copies, according to figures of the Rodina publishers,  which prints the bulk of the periodicals in this country. A  national representative survey of Gallup International found  that the press now has a daily readership of some 2-3 million  Bulgarians (of an 8 million population).    The control over media is now in the limelight of Bulgarian  journalism. The three national media -- the National Radio, the  National TV and the Bulgarian News Agency (BTA) -- are now under  the control of a parliamentary committee. For two years now  radio and television have been working under a  parliament-approved interim statute which places certain  restrictions on the coverage of political processes and events  in this country. The radio and TV bosses, too, are appointed by  parliament. Sometimes, this stirs up heated controversies  pertaining to the freedom of these institutions, as was the case  with the dismissal of National TV boss Asen Agov and BTA  Director General Ivo Indzhev by a restructured parliament. The  rivalry between the political forces for control over the  electronic media is most manifest during pre-election campaigns,  when a special scheme for covering the activities of the  different parties enters into effect. According to researchers,  the electronic media shapes the public opinion more easily than  the press and the public confidence it enjoys is greater.    Private radio stations hit Bulgaria's airwaves more than an  year ago but they broadcast in the FM frequency range and do not  cover the whole of this country's territory.    The 24 CHASA daily boasts the highest press run. This daily  is published by the 168 Chasa Press Group, which is close to  businessman Valentin Mollov's economic grouping. With its first  issue that came out four years ago, it claimed its market niche  and its circulation now is way ahead of the other dailies. The  March 1994 figures of the Rodina publishers show it comes out in  250,000 copies per day.    The second most read daily is DUMA, the daily of the  Socialist Party and heir to the ex-Communists' RABOTNICHESKO  DELO, which runs in about 110,000 copies a day. The  DEMOKRATSIYA daily of the anti-communist Union of the Democratic  Forces (SDS), which circulates a total of about 80,000 copies a  day, comes immediately after.    The past couple of years saw a number of new periodicals,  most of which claim to be independent while being financed by  influential economic and financial formations. One of them is  STANDART NEWS, fourth in the list of dailies with a press-run of  about 70,000 copies, which is financed by the Tron economic  group. NOVINAR ranks sixth with about 63,000 copies a day, and  KONTINENT ninth with 16,000 copies. These dailies, as well as  the 168 CHASA publications, often come under fire of the SDS  which attack them for their links with financial groupings  running on capital with suspicious origin. SDS leader Filip  Dimitrov labels them as "yellow," for carrying information only  to be later disproved, and "pink," for their subscription to the  stance of the former Communists.    TRUD and OTECHESTVEN VESTNIK were the only old-times dailies  that survived the collapse of the communist regime. The former,  once the daily of the official trade unions, is now private and  close to one of Bulgaria's major labour organization, the  Confederation of the Independent Trade Unions in Bulgaria. TRUD  comes out in about 70,000 copies, and OTECHESTVEN VESTNIK in  20,000.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] According to Defense Minister Hugo Estigarribia,  President Juan Carlos Wasmosy's much-anticipated trip to the  Chaco region -- in his capacity as commander in chief--to  inspect the administrative and operational situation of military  units in the area was not possible because the president was  afflicted by a strong flu.    However, the highest-ranking military commanders and Defense  Ministry officials went ahead with the tour on Wasmosy's agenda.    With the president missing, the attention fell on General  Lino Oviedo, who briefed the other generals on work to improve  conditions in Chaco barracks.    The delegation included Defense Minister Hugo Estigarribia;  Anibal Pangrazio, director of the National Commission for the  Development of the Chaco Region; Vice Admiral Eduardo Gonzalez  Petit, military forces commander; Division General Pedro C.  Ocampos, chief of the General Staff; Division General Jose  Cespedes Zarza, Air Force commander; and Vice Admiral Flavio  Abadie, national Navy commander.    During a meeting with reporters, Gen. Oviedo, who was  accused  in the past few days by his own fellow political party members  of acting in partisan politics and of supporting the candidacy  of Atilio R. Fernandez for the presidency of the ANR [National  Republican Association--Colorado Party], said those who accuse  him must present proof of his alleged participation in politics.    Oviedo said he has nothing to do with Colorado Party  presidential hopefuls and reiterated that those who accuse him  must present proof of what they allege.    He said in a well-prepared conciliatory tone that he had  nothing against officialist Deputy Luis Becker, who last weekend  accused him of protecting criminals and corrupt individuals.    Oviedo also said he did not have anything against Juan  Carlos  Galaverna, the other presidential hopeful, who accused him of  participating in a political meeting at Paul Sarubbi's private  residence on 1 June that also was attended by Atilio R.  Fernandez and urban transportation entrepreneurs who allegedly  committed their buses to transport Atilio R. Fernandez  supporters.</p>

			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Observer: Banker's cutback Well done Austria. The cosy world of central banking will never be the same again now the country's right-wing freedom party has made central bank president Maria Schaumayer take a 25 per cent pay cut and end the promise of lifelong jobs for her staff. It's about time someone drew attention to the pay of the fat cats in Europe's central banks. It is hard to imagine any other industry where there's so great a need for a searching look at rewards. Sorting out the variances between countries would cause nightmares to anyone still aspiring to set up the problematical European central bank. Admittedly, Schaumayer's case is rather extreme. Even after her pay cut, she still gets ASch6m, or around Pounds 300,000 a year, which is five times as much as Sweden's Bengt Dennis, and far more than either the Bank of England's Leigh-Pemberton or the Bundesbank's Schlesinger. The Austrian National Bank's staff is more feather-bedded than most, partly because of the country's deep-rooted patronage system. Even so, it is well nigh impossible to tell which of Europe's central banks give value for money. While it's suspected that the Italians and French, like the Austrians, are expensive, nobody has any way of being sure.</p>

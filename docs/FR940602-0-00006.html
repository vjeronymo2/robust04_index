If the business has a sound, profitable and successful history prior to the disaster and there are reasonable projections to ensure it can operate successfully in the future, the proposed loan may be approved even if disaster losses have caused somewhat less equity and/or collateral than would normally be expected for a B&amp;I loan guarantee. If the business appears to have had an unprofitable operation or inadequate cash flow prior to the disaster, the proposed loan guarantee will not be approved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (l)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Equity requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The equity requirements of &sect;1980.441 of this subpart do not apply to BIB loans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (m)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Collateral. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 1980.443 Administrative A. 2., 3., and 4. of this subpart will not apply to BIB loans.

All costs of producing the finished product must be included in the cash flow analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (n)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Conditional approval. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A Form FmHA 449&hyph;14 may be issued prior to receipt of specific items needed to complete an application package provided:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The lender and/or borrower demonstrates to the Government's satisfaction that it has a need for a prompt indication of the availability of the proposed loan guarantee and the conditions under which a guarantee are available;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The specific items missing from the application package will take considerable time to obtain;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The lender requests a commitment prior to providing the items;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The attachment to Form FmHA 449&hyph;14 clearly states that the commitment is conditioned on satisfactory completion of the missing item(s) and a guarantee will not be issued unless all conditions of these regulations are met; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) No Form FmHA 449&hyph;14 will be issued prior to the obligation date established with the Finance Office.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (o)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Financial statements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  All requirements of &sect;1980.451(i)(13) of this subpart will apply except that for BIB loans minimum annual financial statements will be required as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) For nonagricultural borrowers with a B&amp;I indebtedness of $500,000 or less, an annual compilation by an independent certified public accountant or by an independent public accountant licensed and certified on or before December 31, 1970.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) For nonagricultural borrowers with a B&amp;I indebtedness of $500,001 through $1 million, an annual review by an independent certified public accountant or by an independent public accountant licensed and certified on or before December 31, 1970.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

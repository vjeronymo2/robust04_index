			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Young hits out over duty after standstill Mr John Young, the normally ebullient chairman of Young &amp; Co's Brewery, was in far from jocular mood yesterday as he launched a fresh attack on the government's 'short-sighted' policy on beer duty. 'British brewers contribute more in (excise) duty than in the rest of the European Union put together, which puts us at a major disadvantage.' Mr Young was speaking after announcing results virtually unchanged for the 53 weeks to April 2. 'We are being hampered by levels of duty that are totally unfair when compared with the low rates levied on our European competitors.' He continued: 'Cheap, and often illegal, imports are taking away much of our trade and therefore the government's income.' He called for a immediate reduction in British rates 'to restore confidence and to safeguard thousands of jobs'. Pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds 5.18m (Pounds 5.17m). Despite the extra week's trading, turnover showed a marginal decline to Pounds 72.3m (Pounds 72.9m). Following a sizeable drop at the halfway stage, interest charges for the full year remained relatively high at Pounds 2.73m (Pounds 3.02m) reflecting finance of the debenture stock issued in April 1993. 'The long term security and stability the debenture gives us has meant that we have been unable to benefit in full from lower rates', Mr Young said. A recommended final dividend of 7.75p lifts the total by 0.5p to 15p, covered 1.8 times by earnings of 26.43p (26.4p).</p>

			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Survey of Information and Communications Technology (15): Benefits go beyond cost-savings - Facilities Management: contracting-out the running of a company's computing and data communications SPENDING on computing and communications facilities management will overtake sales of mainframe computers in the UK within five years. That forecast by market research firm Dataquest reflects the buoyancy of a business which was growing by almost 50 per cent a year in the UK by the end of the 1980s and is still enjoying annual growth of around 25 per cent. But such success is attracting many new services companies - and the increasing competition is forcing suppliers to do deals which threaten the reputation and future of the whole business, according to some suppliers and market researchers. Moving to facilities management typically means contracting out the running of a company's computing and data communications. In the classic arrangement, a service supplier takes over a company's central computer and most or all of the computing staff. The equipment and staff might stay at the customer's premises and be managed there by the new owner and employer, or they might move to the service company's premises. Alternatively, the systems can be transferred to a computer already run by the ser vice supplier, leaving the customer the possibility of selling its equipment. In most cases the service will eventually be based away from the customer's premises. A variation on this theme is when the customer is switching to different equipment and systems, for example in move to so-called downsizing: typically the replacement of a central mainframe with a network of smaller computers. Here, the service supplier might take on the old systems and keep them running, perhaps with some of the customer's staff, while the customer's computing department stays largely intact and works on the new systems. Telecommunications is a key part of most services. Some companies contract out the building and management of their networks. In computing facilities management, telecoms is vital if the customer is to have the same level of access to the now-remote central computing service as it had when it ran the service itself. Service suppliers have long agreed on the claimed benefits. Recent surveys show that users broadly find the claims are justified. Separate studies by service supplier CMG and research firm Romtec show that users see facilities management offering fixed costs, known well in advance, for a guaranteed level of service. This is the biggest perceived benefit in both surveys: in the CMG study over 60 per cent of users mentioned it. Almost 60 per cent of customers also see a move to facilities management freeing them to concentrate on their core business: they no longer have to concern themselves with running a support activity which is in effect a totally different business in its own right. The suppliers' argument here is that companies contract out catering and vehicle fleet management and even key activities such as research and development, manufacturing and distribution - so why not computing and networks? The other main benefit seen by users is that facilities management overcomes the shortage of internal skills and resources: the service suppliers are centres of concentrated expertise and have to keep their skills up to date in a competitive market. This benefit gets a 50 per cent vote in CMG's survey and a 40 per cent mention in Romtec's. An extra point raised here by the CMG study is that contracting out reduces staff numbers and therefore staff costs. Users largely agree on the disadvantages, too. However, in both the Romtec and the CMG surveys, the existing users give much higher scores to the benefits than to the disadvantages. In addition, non-users give higher ratings to the disadvantages than users do, suggesting that the anxieties decline or prove groundless once a service goes live. Issues mentioned by around a third of users are loss of control of day-to-day service and of strategy, loss of internal skills, the supplier's lack of understanding of the customer's business and the possibility of a future price rise. Costs and cost-savings are more contentious issues. Facilities management contracts involve big money: almost half the contracts run to more than Pounds 500,000 a year and 16 per cent cost over Pounds 2m, according to the CMG study. Last month, Woolworths signed a Pounds 10m three-year contract with Hoskyns involving the transfer of all 51 computing staff and an IBM mainframe running all Woolworths' financial, distribution and sales analysis systems. Woolworths expects to save 20 per cent of its computing costs. Service suppliers put cost savings at between 10 and 25 per cent. However, 43 per cent of users questioned in the CMG survey said there had been no savings. In addition, over half the non-users in the Romtec survey said they rejected facilities management because the costs were too high: this was the biggest reason for rejection among all those questioned. But some suppliers and observers say users need to look beyond the costs issue, which threatens the future of stable facilities management services. THE big growth of the market has recently attracted many suppliers. A business dominated in the 1970s and 1980s by a handful of established services now has an estimated 150 companies seeking a share. But running a successful business depends on having the right number of customers to fill a computer with work and keep a software team fully occupied. 'The potential for significant economies of scale is declining and the opportunity to achieve healthy profit margins is diminishing,' says Mr Graham Brown, a consultant at research company, IDC. 'This squeeze on margins is exacerbated by a significant increase in competition.' He adds: 'The combination of margin pressure and the fight for market share will have a significant impact on the market and may result in a reduction of service levels and unsatisfactory relationships between suppliers and clients.' CMG managing director Mr John Rioch puts this more bluntly: 'Suppliers are buying market share through deals which are marginal or even below margin, to get and keep their volumes up.' Others concede this point - but put a different interpretation on it - 'some suppliers are taking the long view, looking for profit in the third or fourth year as they win extra business such as system development from their client,' says Mr Jon Whiteley of Romtec. Mr Gary Shepherd of service supplier AT&amp;T-Istel agrees. He is also chairman of the Computing Services Association's special interest group on facilities management. 'Companies are buying business to get economies of scale - but this is not necessarily to the detriment of the client,' he says. 'Increasingly, the initial contract is becoming just the start of a long relationship. Contracts used to be around three years; now we're signing contracts of five years and soon it will be 10 years.' Even so, he believes there will be a considerable shake-out in the next five or 10 years, with the market centring on 15 to 20 companies. John Rioch at CMG says future success will depend on suppliers and customers realising together that facilities management is more than just about cost-savings. 'Companies see information technology as a problem, whether it's one of costs or delivering systems on time,' he says. 'So they look at facilities management and they're inundated with options. 'But they need to start by looking at their own internal organisation and what they are trying to achieve as a business. It's not just a case of unloading the computer department. Facilities management should be considered against the whole background of factors such as business re-engineering.' Mr Rioch also believes that companies which rush into facilities management, seeing it mainly as a costs issue, end up with contracts with too many grey areas. He points to CMG's survey, which shows that the biggest concern for users is defining the boundaries of responsibilities: it was mentioned by half the user respondents.</p>

The policemen managed to get into the buidling and it was  Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze who came out to talk to them.    They said that Kviraya is an "unworthy and incompetent man  suspected of corruption and mafia links".    Shevardnadze succeeded to bring the passions down and  explained to Zeikidze and his policemen that their behaviour was  incorrect. The group left the building after that.    Kviraya was appointed the interior minister by the  parliament.</p>

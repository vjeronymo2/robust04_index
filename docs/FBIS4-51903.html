			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Yi Kyo-kwan] </F>   [Text] The Lucky-Goldstar and Samsung business groups are  pushing for infrastructure development projects in North Korea,  although the still unsolved nuclear issue is preventing them  from directly investing in the Communist country.    The Lucky-Goldstar Business Group has in principle accepted  an offer from the Pyongyang government to take over the  management of Kim Chaek Steel Mill, the largest steel maker in  the North, a high-ranking group official said on condition of  anonymity.    "North Korea has put forward the proposal because it needs  the money to resuscitate the steel mill whose operating ratio  has been falling sharply," said the official in an exclusive  interview with THE KOREA HERALD.    Kim Chaek Steel Mill now appears to be heading for a  shutdown  as the North Korean regime doesn't have enough U.S. dollars to  import coke, a coal derivative needed to melt iron ore, from  Russia, he said.    The steel mill's shutdown may have a disastrous effect on  North Korea's already moribund economy. Apparently, to avoid  such a scenario, North Korea contacted Lucky-Goldstar, the  nation's third- largest business conglomerate.    Pyongyang secretly delivered the proposal to Lucky-Goldstar  via its officials in China late last year.    "We have since then negotiated with Pyongyang officials,  including a vice minister, on the matter in China. Recently,  both sides have reached a tentative agreement in Beijing," he  said, declining, however, to elaborate on the deal.    In late March this year, the conglomerate sent a delegation,  including the unnamed Herald source and two other senior  officials from Lucky-Goldstar International Corp., the group's  trading arm, to Beijing to fine-tune contract terms with their  North Korean counterparts.    "When realized, it will be an epoch-making bilateral  economic  cooperation project between the two Koreas," said the  Lucky-Goldstar official who is now responsible for planning the  group's investment projects in the North.    At present, inter-Korea cooperation is not active. A typical  form of cooperation now is South Korean firms sending materials  for such light goods as textiles and toys to their North Korean  partner for processing. Firms in the South export the processed  products abroad.    Pyongyang's unprecedented offer to Lucky-Goldstar led North  Korea watchers to confirm that the Communist country's economy  is nearing the verge of collapse. To revive it, they noted, the  help of foreign countries, including South Korea, will be  essential.    The fact that Kim Chaek Steel Mill may be closed soon was  all  the more shocking to the experts in Seoul because North Korea  promoted Hong Sok-hyong to deputy premier in charge of the  economy in 1993 in a recognition of his achievements as director  of the steel mill, they noted.    "Our investment strategy toward North Korea focuses on heavy  industry where we haven't yet advanced in the South," the Lucky-  Goldstar official said.    Under a long-term strategy mapped out in 1993,  Lucky-Goldstar  aims to make a presence in the steel, auto and shipbuilding  industries by acquiring or setting up plants in the North, he  said.    "This is why we have in principle accepted the Pyongyang  proposal although the investment risks are high," said the  official, adding that such efforts will contribute to helping  reunite the two Koreas in the long run.    In this regard, Lucky-Goldstar is also considering advancing  into the auto industry by taking over the North Korean automaker  Sungni Machinery, the official revealed.    "At present, the Pyongyang government regards Lucky-Goldstar  as the most reliable partner among South Korean business  groups," the official said, citing the group's consistent  efforts to gain the confidence of Pyongyang officials.    Meanwhile, the Samsung Business Group has also decided to  invest in developing a North Korean port on the eastern coast.  According to a Samsung official, the group has recently  accepted an offer from Pyongyang via an ethnic Korean  entrepreneur in China.    "In addition, we are expected to sign an agreement with the  Pyongyang government soon on establishing a joint venture for  container production in the port city near the North Korean  border with Russia," said the Samsung official on the condition  of anonymity.    According to the two unnamed officials of Lucky-Goldstar and  Samsung, their business groups have applied to the Unification  Board for approval of their direct investment projects in North  Korea.    Until 1992, North Korea had made overtures to Hyundai and  Daewoo to attract capital in developing its outdated  infrastructure. Both Hyundai and Daewoo are strong in heavy  industries.    In particular, the Pyongyang government appeared to regard  Hyundai as the best business partner in South Korea. It invited  Chong Chu-yong, the Hyundai chairman, and during his visit,  Chong promised to invest in heavy industrial fields.    The North Korean leadership, however, felt betrayed as the  Hyundai group founder could not keep his investment promises,  said Kim Yong-sin, an official of the Korea Trade Promotion  Corp. (KOTRA).    Along with Hyundai, Daewoo also lost the confidence of the  Pyongyang leadership.    According to the KOTRA official, North Korea has since  focused on maintaining a close relationship with Lucky-Goldstar  which it found to be more reliable and better managed.    As a result, Lucky-Goldstar has tried to build confidence by  placing orders with North Korean firms to produce men's jackets  and toys, the official said.    "At the meeting in Beijing, we also discussed with North  Korean government officials the establishment of a joint venture  to manufacture umbrellas in the Najin-Sonbong free trade zone in  the estuary of the Tumen River," the Lucky-Goldstar official  said.    Regarding the development of the free trade zone, the  Chinese  government has asked Lucky-Goldstar to take part in its project  to build a road linking China with Chongjin, a northeast North  Korean port city, he said.</p>

			<p><P> March 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ABORTION PROTEST ARRESTEES FORCE SLOWDOWN IN COURT  </P> <P> More than 300 jailed Operation Rescue demonstrators jammed Los Angeles  arraignment courts Monday, withholding their names for hours in their  determination to go on trial to further publicize their contention that  abortion is murder.  </P> <P> The arraignment process moved with excruciating slowness -- just as the  arrestees intended.  </P> <P> By late Monday night, only 17 of them had been released, and it looked as  though a great number would spend another night in jail. The 17 were let go  after prosecutors, who could not find their files, decided not to file charges.  </P> <P> Others, buoyed by reports that charges against their leaders were being  reduced, finally relented and relinquished their anonymity. One by one, they  gave court officials their names, Social Security numbers and ages so that the  arraignment process could inch forward at last.  </P> <P> Each, in turn, then pleaded "not guilty" to such misdemeanor charges as  trespassing, resisting arrest and blocking a public street. Trial for each was  set on April 14.  </P> <P> Still other "John Does" and "Jane Does" awaited their turns.  </P> <P> "We're up to our eyeballs," Los Angeles Deputy City Atty. Alice Hand had  groaned hours earlier, as she and her colleagues began to realize just how long  it all would take.  </P> <P> "They're all 'John Does,' she had explained. "That's why we're having a hard  time. It throws everything into chaos. . . . We probably won't get done until  midnight."  </P> <P> It was not until 5:15 p.m. that Municipal Court Commissioner David A. Stephens  announced that paper work had reached him and he was prepared to proceed. But,  he said, the attorneys had to go over all the cases "and apparently they are  not yet ready."  </P> <P> Only two defense attorneys, Mary Murphy Quintero and Robert Sassone, were on  hand to represent any demonstrators who wanted them.  </P> <P> At one point, the city attorney's office made a blanket offer of straight  probation if the arrestees would plead guilty or no contest. The offer was  turned down.  </P> <P> It was well past 7 p.m., when the first groups of arrestees began filing into  two of the courtrooms on Bauchet Street near the Men's Central County Jail --  the men in Division 82, the women in Division 80. It had been a long day in the  holding tanks for all of them, and they showed it, sitting in subdued silence  on the wooden courtroom benches until their individual cases were called.  </P> <P> The city attorney's office asked that bail be set at $3,000, but the courts  decided to stay with the original figure of $250.  </P> <P> Officials said only those with photo identification would be released Monday  night. In a show of solidarity, some with identification chose to remain in  jail.  </P> <P> While his followers were awaiting their arraignments, Operation Rescue founder  Randall Terry and three associates learned that they apparently will not face  felony charges.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Referred Case  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County district attorney's office declined to issue such a  complaint and referred the case to the city attorney for possible misdemeanor  action, district attorney's spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons said.  </P> <P> However, late Monday, the city attorney's office said the Los Angeles Police  Department was seeking to have the felony charges filed.  </P> <P> Police sought a complaint charging Terry, 29; Michael McMonagle, 36; Donald  Benette, 35, and Andrew Eppink, 41, with conspiracy to commit unlawful  assembly.  </P> <P> More than 700 members of Operation Rescue were arrested Saturday as they tried  to blockade a Koreatown-area women's medical center on the third and final day  of the "Holy Week of Rescue." The demonstrations by the organization seeking to  close Southern California abortion clinics were staged at a time when the U.S.  Supreme Court is about to reconsider the abortion question.  </P> <P> More than half of the arrested demonstrators had identified themselves and  bailed out of jail over the weekend. But those who remained were determined to  go to trial.  </P> <P> "We want to put forth the case of the unborn child," Joseph Foreman, national  field director for Operation Rescue, said Sunday.  </P> <P> The result was the long, slow day at the courtrooms at 441 Bauchet St., as the  demonstrators were brought by Sheriff's Department buses from various jail  facilities.  </P> <P> Beth Dailey, a woman arrestee who relented early and gave her name in order to  get released at midday Monday, explained that her sister in New York needed a  blood transfusion and that she, Dailey, was the only possible donor.  </P> <P> Commissioner Stephens plodded through the routine of arraigning the usual  weekend collection of suspected drunks, wife beaters and bar brawlers while he  waited for prosecutors to ready the cases against the demonstrators.  </P> <P> As the buses headed toward Bauchet Street, Stephens mused aloud, "Are we gonna  put them in the Bloods tank or the Crips tank? Wait'll they see the metal  toilets and the baloney sandwiches."  </P> <P> By midafternoon, he observed, "Well, they ate their lunch, and they haven't  begun to tear the concrete out of the walls yet."  </P> <P> Then he went back to processing the weekend backlog of misdemeanor cases. When  a toothless, elderly man accused of breaking a window said he did not want to  "languish in jail," Stephens advised him to talk to one of the free, available  "anti-languishing lawyers."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Resolve Matter  </P> <P> Despite the slowdown, Presiding Municipal Judge Larry P. Fidler said, "It does  not prevent us from doing our job. It just takes that much longer to get it  done. We're prepared to work as many hours as it takes to get the matter  resolved."  </P> <P> A small group of Operation Rescue supporters gathered outside the courtrooms,  where they formed a circle, held hands and prayed.  </P> <P> One woman asked God to "break open these walls and let our men go."  </P> <P> A male member of the group said, "Please, let us not lose sight of why we're  here -- that there are babies still being murdered."  </P> <P> Long Beach police avoided arresting any of the demonstrators who tried to block  the entrances of a small women's clinic in that city Friday, but it was a  different story on Saturday in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "It's been a long, long time since we arrested this many people at a single  incident," Los Angeles police spokesman Cmdr. William Booth said Monday.  </P> <P> Although he conceded that the arrestees were making the process difficult,  Booth declared, "They don't create so many problems that we wouldn't do the  same thing if (it) happened again."  </P> <P> He described the situation as "a large lump going through the system" but  added, "We will pass the lump."  </P> <P> Pointing out that trespassing, resisting arrest, interfering with a police  officer and the other charges are crimes, Booth observed, "It's so darn foolish  to think you have to do this to make the nation listen to you. They are  following some very foolish leadership."  </P> <P> Police Chief Daryl F. Gates said Monday that he was "enormously proud of the  manner in which (the officers) responded."  </P> <P> "The strategical planning, the execution of tactics, the exercise of individual  discipline, patience, restraint and tolerance were obvious to all objective  observers," he said.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Roman Catholic Archbishop Roger Mahony released a statement Monday  in which he criticized pro-choice activists, saying they "support taking the  life of an unborn child."  </P> <P> He urged the U.S. Supreme Court to reconsider the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision  that legalized abortion.  </P> <P> "I hope and pray that the court will see clearly the flawed reasoning (in Roe  vs. Wade) and once again restore the right to life to every person from the  moment of conception to natural death," he said.  </P> <P> Representatives of the pro-choice group Coalition for Safe and Legal Abortions  said they will organize public information campaigns, rallies and community  forums to stir public support for the continued legalization of abortions.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Ginger Thompson and Jack Jones contributed to this article.  </P></p>

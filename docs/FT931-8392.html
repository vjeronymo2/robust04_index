			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Letter: Arms sales - a sign of wider failure Sir, The request by Mr Kozyrev, Russia's foreign minister, to share western markets for arms sales ('Russia offers US arms sales deal', February 16) is a desperate attempt to earn foreign currency. The reason is the failure of the commercial and technical competence within the former USSR to identify what potential customers at home and abroad want, and how to design, make and service such goods. The remark that such income will be used to covert Russia's military industries is also not new and is also pointless. I have worked in many defence factories in the former USSR over the past few years and can testify that, whatever is needed to convert them, it is not large sums of money to buy new equipment. They have a lot of adequate machine tools and up-to-date western and Japanese production equipment - much of it under-used, misused and some still in its original packing cases outside in the yards. Soviets, from Lenin onward, have had the illusion that salvation lies in new 'technology'. They treat it like a toy, whereas the heart of the matter lies in the urgent need to change the mind set and improve radically their business and technical competence in order to perform competitively and, indeed, to supply their own hungry markets. Conversion of the defence industries depends on that first; without it investment will be wasted as it always has been in the communist command economy.

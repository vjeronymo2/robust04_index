			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Bowthorpe 20% ahead to Pounds 51m - US subsidiaries were main growth area with 35% of operating profits Bowthorpe, the international electronic and electrical components group, yesterday reported a 20 per cent increase in 1993 pre-tax profits to Pounds 51.1m, slightly ahead of forecasts made in mid-December when the group announced a successful Pounds 64.4m rights issue. The result, described by Mr John Westhead, chief executive, as 'pleasing' given 'the tough economic environment,' compares with pre-tax profits of Pounds 42.7m in 1992. Turnover grew by 26 per cent to Pounds 334m (Pounds 265m), including Pounds 9.3m from acquisitions and Pounds 27.3m attributed to translation gains. The US produced 34 per cent (29 per cent) of group turnover, the UK accounted for an unchanged 31 per cent and continental Europe contributed 28 per cent (32 per cent). The fastest growing region for sales was Asia which generated turnover of Pounds 21m (Pounds 13m.) Operating profits increased by 24 per cent to Pounds 52.5m (Pounds 42.3m) of which Pounds 2.1m came from 1993 acquisitions and Pounds 5.3m arose on translation. The group's US subsidiaries were the main area of growth, generating 35 per cent of overall operating profits, compared with 31 per cent. Most of the profit growth came from the electronics segment with operating profits of Pounds 34.4m (Pounds 26.3m) helped by profits growth in the European terminals market and by strong gains in the US computer and medical markets for electro-ceramics businesses. The electrical businesses also reported a 13 per cent increase in operating profits to Pounds 18.1m (Pounds 16m) with a broadly based recovery in the US offsetting the sharp reduction in demand experienced by the European cable care operations. Profits were reduced by net interest costs of Pounds 1.44m (Pounds 381,000 received). Bowthorpe ended the year with net borrowings of Pounds 41.5m, equivalent to gearing of 54 per cent, after capital expenditure of Pounds 22.7m (Pounds 19.6m) and acquisitions totalling Pounds 39.6m of which Pounds 32.5m was paid in cash. Earnings per share increased by 18 per cent to 18.18p (15.36p) helped by a reduced effective rate of taxation of 32 per cent (35.5 per cent). As forecast, a final dividend of 5.03p (4.57p) is proposed for a total up 8.6 per cent at 6.91p (6.36p.) COMMENT Despite less than ideal market conditions around the globe Bowthorpe continues to deliver underlying profit growth. The rights issue proceeds will enable the group to pursue its successful strategy of building global niche businesses, and perhaps to expand further in the fast growing Asian market. This year pre-tax profits of about Pounds 59m are likely although earnings are expected to be flat, held back by the dilutive effects of the rights issue and a more normal tax charge of about 35 per cent. The shares slipped 3p to 347p yesterday and are trading on a forward multiple of around 19.2 but could go higher.</p>

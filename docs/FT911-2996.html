			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (23): Financing a family idyll - Serious Riches / It's been based on: acumen, luck and joint decisions MONEY IS not the only currency,' observes Christopher Lloyd Owen. 'You can be stinking mega-rich and unhappy.' Mr Lloyd Owen is certainly not unhappy. Whether he qualifies as 'stinking mega-rich' is another matter; but life's adventures have left him, at the age of 38, with a seven-bedroom Jacobean house, tucked between the few hills surrounding Norwich, and a considerable clutch of investments. More important, he is happily married to his wife, Antonia, and has two children - Edward, 10, and Rose, seven. All business decisions are taken jointly, he says. Business acumen, coupled, as he freely admits, with luck, built the family's prosperity. After school at Winchester and university at the Courtauld Institute in London, where he was taught by Anthony Blunt, he worked as an art dealer for 10 years, and then built up small businesses, in London and then in Norfolk. It is vital to the philosophy guiding Mr Lloyd Owen's personal finances that he lives his life, and tailors his finances to fit it - never the other way around. Business and finance are discussed thoughtfully and incisively, but opinions on less dry subjects have a habit of bursting up into the conversation. Topics include his wife, his children, animals, art, particularly bird art, gardening, and shooting. The family home - crammed with prints, paintings, and ornaments - bears testament to his earlier career as an art dealer. Six sofas show that the family has been lucky to receive a number of legacies. The house - his fourth  - is also the best example of the part luck has played in the family's good fortune. He has bought all the four houses he has ever viewed. All the moves accidentally took advantage of property price moves. The first two homes were in Wandsworth, before the yuppies moved in. Then the family went to Battersea, just before gentrification had reached that far. In 1986, at last able to move back to Norfolk where he had been brought up, he viewed his present house, fell in love with it, and bought it with cash. Over the following year, East Anglian property values almost doubled. He has a Pounds 30,000 mortgage to take advantage of mortgage interest tax relief, but has otherwise avoided debt to finance property buying. He scorns speculative property investment, and does not intend to buy a second house. 'I would have thought for most people their home would be a sufficient property investment. His conservative investment philosophy ensures the family's idyllic lifestyle can continue. Mr Lloyd Owen took out a pension when he was 32, which is now building 'nicely thank you'. But it was a wrench: 'It's very hard for anyone to realise they are going to be 65. I forced myself to start a pension, but every time you pay it out it's dead money.' He runs the pension fund through his company, for himself, via Standard Life. This is the family's only collective investment. Unit trusts he considers 'dull and grey'. 'Imagine you had Pounds 5,000 to invest and you bought Pounds 5,000 in UK equity units from some manager. How dull] Wouldn't it be more fun to have Pounds 2,500 in BP and Pounds 2,500 in Marks and Spencer?' He expands: 'If you have a portfolio of UK equities with a reasonable spread, you've done exactly what the unit trusts have done. They have only put several eggs in one basket. He admits the worth of unit trusts for investing in foreign situations, but resists moves by brokers in this direction. 'We hold a reasonably balanced British equity portfolio - haven't the share-owning classes been owning British equities since the coffee-houses started? 'Someone once told me the stock market is only the upper class betting shop. At that time I was rather horrified. But there's a grain of truth in it. 'As investors, our balance is almost entirely widows and orphans stocks  - blue chip companies like ICI, Guinness and Glaxo. We were both brought up with the old-fashioned ideas that you should never sell capital and neither a borrower nor a lender be. And we are too busy living life to bother with short-term gambles and speculations.' Their portfolio was for many years handled by Grieveson Grant, which joined Kleinwort Benson at Big Bang. Mr Lloyd Owen then left Kleinworts for Laing &amp; Cruickshank, and now also uses a broker in Norwich. His reasons are clear and trenchantly expressed - some London brokers are over-charging, and the future for small investors lies with regional stockbrokers: 'I think the London brokers have decided not to give the client what he wants, because their main fee income comes form corporate work. The small client is having to pay huge fees for analysts. 'The provincial firm, because they don't employ analysts and don't have to pay Pounds 120 a square foot, I believe is going to end up as the best stockbroker. I think they will serve the small investors best. 'We left Kleinwort Benson when their fee became ridiculous. It was going to be a third of the income from the portfolio, even if they neither bought nor sold a share.' He is also 'heavily into Peps'. 'Anyone with a portfolio who doesn't annually move a small amount into a Pep is a fool.' The brokers are instructed to boost the Lloyd Owens' Peps to their capacity every year. The only other big investment goes towards schooling. At present, Edward is at prep school in Northamptonshire, and Rose is still at a local village school. Having made the decision to pursue a private education for their children, the Lloyd Owens put a lump-sum into a school-fees capital scheme. 'We might have been able to do as well elsewhere, but we've also got a life to lead, and the scheme is going to do it for us. At the beginning of every term, we will get a handsome cheque. We can't get at the lump sum, but it's done.' Prudence over life's most weighty concerns means bland practicality never stands in the way of a light impulse, as two delicate, and beautiful African red-eared waxbills in the corner of the Lloyd Owen kitchen could testify. He saw them while in a pet-shop to buy dog-food, and fell in love with them. He bought a cage at the same time, and carried them home. Impulse buying was off the agenda when he was an art dealer. Dealers, unlike an auctioneers, own their own art. Dealing is not for the faint-hearted, particularly if, as in Mr Lloyd Owen's case, you work on your own account. 'The problem is that, to be a London art dealer, you do not just need weekend money; you need quite major financing if you want to buy really good pictures, which is why quite a lot of London art dealers work for a bank. 'It's a very bad investment, art, anyway. You should never buy a picture for an investment. Only buy a picture if you like it. You should only buy a picture as an investment if you are a dealer - then you have a chance to make a profit out of it. Buying any object for an investment is a gamble. 'I stopped because I could no longer afford to buy the pictures I wanted, because I had just got married. That was in 1978. It was great fun - I was very much what you might call a dealer's dealer. I owned shares in pictures and bought from one dealer and sold to another, rather than having private customers.' Most dealings on his own account were in English Victorian painters, of whom Frith, best known for 'Derby Day', was an example. Mr Lloyd Owen says the experience taught him one thing: 'You have never sold a painting until you have got the money. There are a lot of companies out there supplying goods and having their customers going bust on them. It's given me extraordinary caution about giving credit to people. If you work on normal profit-margins and you do not get paid for 70 days, I would rather not have the deal.' This provides a direct line to the core of his current finances, his two companies, both of which seem far-removed from the world of high art. One, Promotion Sourcing Ltd, is owned entirely by the Lloyd Owens. It supplies companies with promotional gifts, such as golf-balls, diaries or beer coasters emblazoned with the company logo. 'I went into that in 1983 when I acquired 50 per cent of the equity. In 1985, I bought my co-partner out of it.' Then came the chance to buy into Hangar Press, a Norwich litho printer which now shares a building with Promotion Sourcing. 'That's constituted as a partnership. They are different organisations because I have a partner in Hangar Press. 'We are keen on credit control, and we have minimal borrowings. We don't bleed the business dry. The two companies have a workforce of 11 - and I have cracking good employees. They are your most important investment, and your biggest expense. We have great fun at work, and we make money.' Christopher Lloyd Owen is a 'hands-on' businessman, and regards the companies as the major financial effort in his family's life: 'They have to be. And in a way, apart from providing us with an income, they are the only bit of thinking financially that we do about inheritance. Selling out the business could be my pension fund. We are conscious of that. 'But if you can have fun on the way ..' 'Imagine you had Pounds 5,000 to invest and you bought Pounds 5,000 in UK equity units from some manager,' says Christopher Lloyd Owen 'How dull] Wouldn't it be more fun to have Pounds 2,500 in BP and Pounds 2,500 in Marks and Spencer?' Even a careful and well informed investor can lose money on what ought to be a routine operation. Ron Boyce switched his Pounds 2,853 unit trust investment into a Pep, and it cost him Pounds 248</p>

			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Buckingham bid has Pounds 3m value BUCKINGHAM International, the hotels and nursing homes group, has produced one of the more bizarre bids of the year. A bidder that did not want to bid; an adviser that does not necessarily advise rejection of the offer - even though it values Buckingham's ordinary shares at less than 3 per cent of what auditors say the company is worth on a long-term basis. The bid was triggered because the Takeover Panel has ruled that Buckingham's largest shareholder, Naaz Holdings, is acting in concert with Jemma, run by one of the deputy chairman's relatives, and now have 38.7 per cent of the common shares. Naaz is a company owned by a trust of which Mr Nurdin Jivraj, Buckingham deputy chairman, and Mr Nick Jivraj, his son and chief executive, and their families are beneficiaries. The relative of Mr Nurdin Jivraj is beneficiary of a trust run by Jemma. Buckingham shareholders are being offered 2.75p for each ordinary, valuing the offer at Pounds 3.3m, and 27.5p for each Pounds 1 nominal of loan stock, valuing this offer at Pounds 9.1m. Buckingham's share price closed 0.25p down at 4.5p. The offer comes from Purlieus, a Jersey company owned by a trust of which Mr Nick and Mr Nurdin Jivraj, are beneficiaries. Advisers to the independent directors have advised that the loan stock offer would be rejected. The loan stock holders subscribed Pounds 33m only last year and are secured on some of the group's properties. The common stock offer is a different matter. Buckingham said that 1993 and 1994 would be 'tough years for the group in terms of meeting cash requirements but the board believes these problems will be resolved'. As a result, the independent advisers are not necessarily advising rejection of the common stock offer. 'Shareholders who are convinced about the quality and value of the Buckingham Group's assets and management may wish, despite certain significant risks, to retain an ongoing interest in Buckingham', said Robert Fleming, advisers. This course of action might be taken in the light of the difference in the offer value and net assets of Pounds 113m derived from the audited figures. Net debt stands at Pounds 92.4m. 'Shareholders who are not confident in the prospects for Buckingham or who are risk averse should consider selling in the market,' the advisers said. Jemma bought its 8.6 per cent stake in Buckingham last September at a maximum price of 2.75p. Panel rules say the offer needs to be made at the highest price paid for the shares.</p>

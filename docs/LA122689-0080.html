			<p><P> December 26, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROMANIA: DEATH OF A DICTATOR;  </P> <P> JOY, SADNESS MARK DEMONSTRATION BY ROMANIAN EXPATRIATES IN L.A.  </P> <P> Strong and mixed emotions dominated a small demonstration by Romanian  expatriates at Los Angeles City Hall on Monday night.  </P> <P> Joy that Nicolae Ceausescu had been deposed as dictator of their homeland  combined with sorrow that apparently tens of thousands have died in the  process. Hope for a new democratic government was diluted by outrage at the  rumored presence of Libyan and Syrian mercenaries fighting on the side of  Ceausescu's police.  </P> <P> About 150 of the approximately 11,000 Romanians living in the Los Angeles area  gathered to hold lighted candles and red, blue and yellow Romanian flags --  conspicuously lacking the green Communist insignia in the center.  </P> <P> They chanted "Kadafi out of Romania!" and carried signs with such messages as  "Ceausescu Anti-Christ is Dead. Ho, ho, ho."  </P> <P> Virgil Anastasiu, a Panorama City resident who defected from a Romanian  merchant ship 3 1/2 years ago, said a private execution was too good for  Ceausescu. "Everybody should take a piece of his skin, like they did the Berlin  Wall," he said.  </P> <P> The Romanian Relief Fund is collecting money, food and clothing and will turn  all donations over to the Red Cross, spokesman Sergio Onaga said. The mailing  address is: 7250 Bandini Blvd., Unit 111, City of Commerce 90040. Further  information can be obtained by calling (213) 724-8360 or (213) 724-8362.  </P></p>

			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Shares fall sharply following employment data - Market Report The UK stock market fell heavily yesterday after news that domestic unemployment had fallen sharply last month, indicating that good economic news can be bad news for investors. The fall in unemployment, considerably greater than predicted, was seen as reducing the chances for an early cut in UK base rates, and thus weakened one of the props supporting the current level of share prices. Also disturbed by the overall weakness in continental European markets, the FT-SE 100 Index tumbled 41.8 to 3,372. Although upset by yesterday's statistics on the UK economy, and by the consequent firmness in sterling which also reduced the chances of a base rate cut, UK market strategists appeared unwilling to change their views on market prospects. Most strategists have already put back expectations for the next base rate cut at least until the spring, when the government may feel that the changes in social security and mortgage taxes will take effect. But the general conviction that there is another cut in base rates ahead remained unchanged. Some analysts, including the BZW team, held to the view that UK base rates could come down to 4 1/2 per cent this year. There was good deal of selling yesterday from investors who had remained unconvinced by the pre-Christmas run-up in share prices. However, the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, down 24.6 at 3,864.6, continued to outperform the FT-SE 100 Share Index and non-Footsie business represented around 60 per cent of the day's Seaq volume of 807.6m shares. Tuesday's 882.8m shares through the Seaq electronic network was worth just over Pounds 2bn in retail business worth, confirming that genuine investment activity in UK equities remains very high. Share prices opened lower in London and were again influenced strongly by trends in stock index futures. The picture was much the same as at the beginning of the week. Bank shares continued to soften ahead of the sector trading statements, and there was little recovery in the store and retail stocks which are still seen as the key to a genuine recovery in both the UK economy and also in market sentiment. International stocks were depressed by yesterday's firmness in sterling, which threatens their export prospects. Oil shares gave back some of their recent gains and the pharmaceuticals sector lacked supporters. One factor undermining overall sentiment across the London markets as well as in the blue chip sector was the suggestion from several global market strategists that institutional cash flows could begin to move back towards Japan. Kleinwort Benson, the UK merchant banking and securities house, warned that this could mean significant withdrawal of global funds from other markets - with the UK high on the list of those markets threatened. London benefited last year from an inflow of international funds. Weakness in the New York market, which fell 10 Dow points in UK hours, was a final blow to London, although UK traders saw this as no more than another temporary factor which did nothing to change investment sentiment. A technical setback on profit-taking has been widely predicted in the wake of the pre-Christmas advance in UK equities and few London specialists were prepared to change their minds on the basis of yesterday's fall in share prices.</p>

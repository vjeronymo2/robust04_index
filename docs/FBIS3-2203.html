			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 7 (AFP)--Former Pakistan premier  Moeen Qureshi announced here Monday the establishment of the  first large-scale international investment fund exclusively  targetting infrastructure projects in China and other developing  countries.    The billion-dollar AIG (American International Group) Asian  Infrastructure Fund, originally promoted and invested by AIG, is  to provide equity financing for major Chinese infrastructure  projects in the transport, telecommunications, and power  sectors, said Qureshi, a former World Bank and IMF executive.  Half the fund will be invested in China, while the other half  will be concentrated on Association of Southeast Asian Nations  (ASEAN) countries, he added.    As well as AIG, the main investor in the 10-year fund is the  Singapore government which has injected 250 million dollars  through various subsidiaries.    The first closing of the Bermuda-based fund has just been  completed in Singapore to the tune of 760 million dollars,  Qureshi said, adding that the second closing in a few months  time would bring the fund's resources to at least one billion  dollars.    China's international investment arm, the China  International  Trust and Investment Corp. (CITIC) -- another major investor in  the fund, will act as a local adviser together with the Bank of  China.    The participation of U.S. pension funds, endowment plans,  and  insurance companies in the scheme signals a changing trend in  capital flow with long-term investors beginning to target  developing countries, Qureshi said. "This represents a sea  change in the willingness of long-term investors to venture out  into developing countries," he said, adding that China's rapid  economic growth coupled with the problem of transport  bottlenecks provided "important opportunities" for  infrastructure investment here.    Following talks with Chinese officials, Qureshi said the  fund  was looking to invest in certain railway links and pilot  projects aimed at opening up China's telecommunications sector.  "We have also been specifically asked to consider the  expressway that links Beijing with the capital of Hebei  Province, Shijiazhuang, and four or five power projects."    Some 80 percent of the funds resources will be invested in  the telecommunications, power and transport sectors alone, he  added.</p>

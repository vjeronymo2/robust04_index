			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Good food costs less The whiff of grapeshot rose from Tesco's interim figures yesterday. A decline in gross margins - the first for nearly a decade - is the skirmish with live ammunition which marks the end of the phoney price war. Tesco is taking sales from the other superstore operators at a rate which none of them can ignore. They will have to respond to the 'value line' initiative with cheap own label goods, and the struggle seems likely to escalate. While Asda and Gateway were quietly folding in on themselves, the big three could rely on easy market share gains. Now Asda is on its way back. Gateway has been ring-fenced from its debts, while the discount presence is growing and leading grocers still chant the mystical mantra of expansion until the end of the decade. With ever-expanding capacity in an almost fixed-volume business, something clearly has to give. Yet the horrendous costs of quitting and high fixed overheads of superstores force the grocers to run them for cash. That effectively means there is almost no limit to the margin erosion which could occur if the grocers descended into a game of competitive devaluation. The market has, of course, already priced much of the risk of a limited engagement. It has not, however, come to terms with the possibility of an all-out war. In terms of its market value, almost all of the Pounds 572m raised in Tesco's 1991 rights issue has now gone up in smoke. At the time it was expected to make Pounds 660m in 1992, yet it will struggle to earn Pounds 600m in the current year. Meanwhile managements continue to whistle a happy tune and think a happy thought as the gravy train runs out of steam.</p>

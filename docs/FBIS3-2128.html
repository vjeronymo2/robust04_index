			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By business editor Ray Heath] </F>   [Text] In one of the most generous budgets produced  anywhere, [Financial Secretary] Sir Hamish Macleod yesterday  bowed to the fact that the Hong Kong Government is collecting  money faster than it could spend it. So he proposed giving at  least $7 billion of it back. For the first time the Government  revealed its forecast for the amount of cash that would be in  the funds after handover in 1997, and the $269 billion available  to the Special Administrative Region (SAR) government by March  1998 showed it could afford to be generous.    Tax bills are to be slashed by $3.2 billion and almost half  a  million people will join those who pay none at all, companies  will be left with more of their profits, the cost of buying a  home will be shaved and welfare spending will be raised. Sir  Hamish said there were four major challenges facing Hong Kong  which must be remedied: inflation, the improvement of rail,  road and air links, traffic congestion and the provision of  financial security for the greying population.    The overall theme was "Managing Prosperity" and was the sort  of budget finance ministers around the world dream of. It was,  said Sir Hamish after delivering his speech to the Legislative  Council, a "pretty historic Budget" and almost certainly  contained a record amount of concessions on salaries tax.    The number of individuals who will not be paying income tax  will jump from an already high 43 percent to 58 percent,  described by Sir Hamish as "a fantastic difference". The  measures take 420,000 people out of the tax net altogether and a  further 1.13 million will find themselves paying lower taxes  from this year. Huge increases in family allowances, including  the introduction of a new one for taxpayers caring for a  grandparent, meant that the very important middle and upper  income groups -- and almost every civil servant -- will benefit.    One of the big surprises of the Budget was cutting profits  tax from 17.5 percent to 16.5 percent. This will leave Hong  Kong companies with an extra $1.6 billion to invest in 1994/95,  and will reduce their tax bills by more than $10 billion up to  1997. At the same time, Sir Hamish is planning to raise the  cost of welfare spending, with funds being allocated to the  elderly, disabled, sick and disadvantaged, with more places for  nurseries and creches for children.    Despite the growing fears about the rise in residential  property prices -- which Sir Hamish shares -- the Government has  decided that it can afford to reduce stamp duty on property  transactions. Like many other proposals in the Budget, this is  aimed particularly at the sandwich class and the reductions will  apply only to properties priced at under $3 million. He said  the Government believed that the cumulative effect of stamp duty  on speculators who bought and sold flats several times before an  end-user actually moved in would be a deterrent.    Even visitors will benefit from the proposed measures. After  listening to the recommendations of the tourist industry, the  Government is to reduce the much disliked airport departure tax  from $150 to $50.    There was very little sour among the sweet -- even the usual  step of raising taxes on the good things in life was resisted.  There will be no rise in duty on tobacco, the incomprehensible  system of charging duty on alcohol content will be simplified,  to the benefit of the low end products in the market, and the  tax on fuel will go up by only 8.5 percent, to reflect  inflation. To placate the anti- smoking lobby, the Government  is to donate an extra $7.5 million to the Council on Smoking and  Health for anti-smoking campaigns, on top of the $4.1 million  they already receive every year.    If it looked a little over-generous Sir Hamish believed that  Hong Kong could afford it, safe in the knowledge that the  projection of future revenues and surpluses in the government  finances meant that it would be comfortably, even luxuriously,  within its targets for handing over a properly financed  territory to the SAR in 1997.    In his medium range forecast, Sir Hamish revealed that by  March 1998, the outgoing government would have built up reserves  of $268.9 billion. This compares with the $25 billion which the  Government has committed to set aside for the SAR government,  plus a further $7 billion in respect of civil service pensions.    After last year's 5.5 percent increase in gross domestic  product the sum total of goods and services purchased in the  territory -- Sir Hamish is predicting that the economy will grow  by the same amount this year. But the flip side of the growth  coin remains inflation, and on this, yesterday's news was not so  good for another year of rising prices is forecast, with no cut  from last year's rate of 8.5 percent. He is also planning major  overhaul of the companies ordinance, in what one official  described as "root and branch" tidying up of the piecemeal  legislation which has come on the statue books over the years.</p>

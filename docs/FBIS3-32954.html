			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with presidential hopeful Andres </F> Pastrana by Dario Arizmendi and unidentified reporters in Santa  Fe de Bogota; from "Caracol's 0600 to 0900" newscast -- live]    [Text] [Arizmendi] We are greeting the new presidential  candidate Dr. Andres Pastrana Arango, who last night staged a  spectacular event in Santa Fe de Bogota worthy of the best  campaign rally in the United States or Europe -- one that  featured truly extraordinary organization and the participation  of more than 3,000 people who packed the Gonzalo Jimenez de  Quezada Convention Center. Good morning, Dr. Pastrana.    [Pastrana] Good morning, Dario.    [Arizmendi] Are you satisfied with yesterday's event?    [Pastrana] I am very happy, but it is more important that  Colombians be satisfied, not me. Also, the truth is that we  succeeded in unveiling most of our platform. The truth is we  are very happy.    [Arizmendi] What do you think are the highlights of your  platform?    [Pastrana] I think it is the whole area of social  investment,  something I think has been missing in our country, and all the  opportunities now arising in Colombia. That is why I think  most... [pauses] I think this recaps most of what we wanted  [word indistinct] the time for Colombia has come. I think that  through the efforts and hard work of all Colombians we are going  to move ahead.    [Arizmendi] Some analysts feel that in last night's speech,  in some of your promises and chiefly in your slogans, you evoked  Jose Maria Aznar and his presidential campaign in Spain. His  slogan was: Spain now. As I understand it, you concluded your  speech by saying: Do not be mistaken, we are going to win; we  are going to win. That is how Aznar always concluded his  speeches. Is your friendship with Aznar responsible for this  similarity?    [Pastrana] [laughs] We did not do it with that in mind,  despite my friendship with Jose Maria Aznar. I think yesterday  we tried to create a different style of presenting politics by  way of a much more direct speech. As you could see, it  contained examples. The language of the speech appealed to the  people much more. I tried to explain most of our platform. I  think the time for Colombia has indeed come, and this is why we  must begin to work soon to begin to resolve the country's  problems.    [Arizmendi] Are you still a Conservative?    [Pastrana] Yes, of course, I am still a Conservative, as I  said yesterday. I think I was a little repetitive in outlining  the campaign. Sometimes campaigns center on the wrong things.  I think the topic of whether or not I am Conservative....  [pauses] this was defined a long time ago. I am and will remain  a Conservative, but I am bringing to the attention of the  Colombian people an eminently nationwide, suprapartisan  [suprapartidista] candidacy. As I said yesterday, the campaign  cannot be centered on whether or not I am Misael Pastrana's son.  I am the son of Misael Pastrana, whom I love, admire, and  respect, but as I said yesterday, we have led different lives  and have been active in politics at different times. I also said  yesterday that I will not shave my moustache. I said I was not  going to shave it, and we were going to keep it throughout the  electoral process.    [Arizmendi] Do not worry, I will not shave mine either.  [laughs] Dr. Pastrana, what role will your father -- former  President Misael Pastrana Borrero -- play in your political  campaign?    [Pastrana] No, Dario, I believe that.... [pauses] in  preparing for our campaign we have made great efforts to  consolidate a significant group that will support us and work  with us. I believe this was evident yesterday, when our  candidacy was proclaimed. Naturally, Dario, my father has always  been close to me. He is an excellent adviser, but naturally we  are maintaining our organization, and we have clear proposals.  I believe this is the first time a candidate has presented such  a complete plan. Not only are we saying what we will do, but  how we will do it, which in my opinion is the most important  aspect of our government platform.    [Arizmendi] By accepting a suprapartisan Conservative  candidacy, we imagine your running mate as vice presidential  candidate will be a Liberal candidate?    [Pastrana] That is possible, Dario. You know that from the  Senate I was possibly the one senator who was most opposed to a  constitutional amendment by which the vice presidential  candidate had to be of the same political affiliation as the  presidential candidate. We won that battle in the Senate, and  now that door remains open. I believe, Dario, that we must  wait. The process is just beginning, the parliamentarian  elections will be in March, and I believe later on in the  elections process we will elect -- at least in my case -- our  running mate.    [Arizmendi] What profile will that person have, Dr.  Pastrana?    [Pastrana] First, he must be someone who is identified fully  with our government plan, and logically a person the president  of the Republic can trust. Those are two conditions I feel the  vice president should have.    [Arizmendi] What are your views regarding the presence of  foreign troops in our country? Give us your views.    [Pastrana] Dario, I believe that troops in Colombia based on  cooperation agreements that deal with technical aspects or  aspects related to drug trafficking and terrorism must be  welcomed here. I believe Colombians should not reject any help  that will enable us to eradicate drug trafficking and terrorism  from our country. In facing that situation, I believe we must  clearly say that the signing of various agreements has been very  important for our country and that it will continue to be  important in the future to maintain foreign troops and advisers  in those fields. I believe this should be clear.    What possibly has happened in the Juanchaco case -- and even  the government has admitted this -- is that there has not been  enough clarity on the subject. Colombians are demanding  clarity. In that sense, I believe Colombians have always  reacted [word indistinct] with regard to the participation of  foreign troops or advisers in matters important to the country.  I believe we must support and maintain their presence.    [Arizmendi] What is your opinion of the way in which  President Cesar Gaviria Trujillo reacted to the decision and  statement issued by the State Council on how the government  handled the presence of foreign troops in Juanchaco?    [Pastrana]) I believe all positions should be respected.  What we are having now is a debate with regard to whether the  Constitution was properly applied or not. The State Council has  clearly stated its juridical position, and the president of the  Republic has replied to this position. I believe it is  important to mention -- and I said this in a news release --  that we are talking about the implementation of international  treaties that are current [words indistinct] and I feel it is  important and still possible to convoke the Foreign Relations  Advisory Commission to clear up any doubts that might exist with  regard to the implementation of current international treaties  Colombia has signed.    [Arizmendi] Will you extend a friendly hand to the five  members of the Conservative Party who will run against you?    [Pastrana] Not only to them, but friends from various  sectors. We want Conservatives, Liberals, and independents to  support our presidential candidacy.    [Arizmendi] You have identified with President Gaviria's  economic policy. Some sectors have criticized that policy,  which has been described as neoliberal and having a high social  cost. Will you continue the same policy as Gaviria?    [Pastrana] Yes, definitely. I believe I said this clearly  yesterday. On the subject of economic opening, I have said we  must consolidate the process. President Gaviria has laid the  foundations for a policy; now we must start building it. Some  adjustments must be made to the foundations. In our speech  yesterday we noted that today the government is seeking  efficiency from the industrialists, but we are not giving them  the tools to do this. As I said yesterday, I believe if we  create a good infrastructure to project our country abroad, and  if we make the necessary adjustments, our country will move  ahead in the opening process. I also believe -- and I have been  serious about this -- that we must consolidate all the necessary  conditions to help the country in the area of social  investments. We must make great efforts to obtain funds to  conduct a revolution in education and to consolidate and develop  rural areas once and for all, as well as consolidate peace and  tranquility, which is what all Colombians want.    [Arizmendi] Dr. Pastrana, you have said you will not  receive any contribution or aid from the Santo Domingo Group for  the election campaign. Will you adopt the same position with  regard to other economic groups?    [Pastrana] I did not say that. What I have said publicly, as  you know, is that issue is behind me. I have adopted a clear  position regarding Colombia's privatization process. I have  expressed the hope that Colombia's privatization process will  not constitute a transition from a state monopoly to a private  sector monopoly. What is at issue is the democratization of our  institutions and our ability to plan for the future as other  countries have done under similar circumstances. In Chile and  other Latin American countries, privatization processes were  employed to democratize institutions instead of creating  monopolies.    [Arizmendi] Dr. Andres Pastrana, if you have not said  publicly that you will not receive economic contributions from  the Santo Domingo Group, what is your position regarding  contributions made by various economic groups to your political  campaign?    [Pastrana] You are well aware of the Santo Domingo Group  case, Dario. The position I have adopted has nothing to do with  public opinion; it is a personal position. I believe it is  important to establish rules that will preclude concentrating  power in the hands of a few and instead truly foster the  decentralization and democratization of institutions, especially  those that belong to the state.    [Arizmendi] Dr. Pastrana, forgive me for insisting, but  perhaps I did not understand your position. Does this mean you  will not accept economic aid for your campaign from the Santo  Domingo Group?    [Pastrana] You have asked that question three times, and I  understood you each time. If the decision were mine to make I  would say no, but it is a political decision.    [Arizmendi] What about other economic groups? Will you  accept aid from the Ardila Group, Sarmiento Group, or Chavarria  Group?    [Pastrana] Dario, what matters is the management of campaign  finances, which will not be done directly by Andres Pastrana.  For that I have appointed Hernan Bell, who is very capable, and  I have a large group of friends who are helping us amass  resources to consolidate the upcoming political process.    I believe, Dario, that it is important and fortunate that  democracy exists in Colombia and that the state is largely  financing the elections. Today the state, through the Electoral  Law, is supplying funds to congressional, senatorial, council,  assembly and presidential candidates, depending on the number of  votes they receive. I believe this is a very significant aspect  of the Colombian political process, because without that aid  many people would be unable to campaign. Because of it,  however, the political process is much more transparent.    [Arizmendi] As for transparency, Dr. Pastrana, it would be  nice to have an explanation of what happened between you and the  Santo Domingo Group. What did the group do to you or what  happened to create this situation and to prompt the remarks you  have made?    [Pastrana] I believe this is an internal issue; it is not an  electoral campaign issue. The fact is that the Santo Domingo  Group and I know what happened and I do not believe this is an  issue in the campaign.    [Arizmendi] Dr. Pastrana, during your speech last night at  the Convention Center you referred to a reduction in beer taxes.  Would you briefly explain your position?    [Pastrana] Yes. It is largely an effort to defend the  incomes of municipalities and departments. I believe we should  ensure that they maintain a large part of their income from  taxes on beer, which has been essential to certain municipal and  departmental projects.    [Arizmendi] You have spoken of complete, irreversible  openness. Do you believe it is equitable for the national beer  industry to compete with contraband beer on which taxes are not  paid?    [Pastrana] I would not put it that way, Dario. I do not like  to analyze politics [word indistinct] the way you are doing it.  I believe you should listen again to the speech I delivered  yesterday. If I came down hard on anything it was on contraband  in Colombia. I even made a statement I would characterize as  very harsh but which truly represents the feelings of the  Colombian people. I said I believe Colombia's Customs Service  is an embarrassment and we cannot allow contraband to compete  against the industrial sector in our national markets. While  industry is paying manufacturing costs and the VAT [value-added  tax], contraband is invading our markets. Because of this very  situation, I have said we must consolidate customs in Colombia  because the country must try to compete in international markets  under fair conditions.    [Reporter] Dr. Pastrana, in the past Belisario Betancur,  also a Conservative, made the same call you are making today.  The Liberals who backed him later paid a high political price  and lost the elections. Do you believe that they learned their  lesson and will not support you? Or do you really believe that  your call on sectors other than the Conservatives will be  answered?    [Pastrana] I believe the call will be heeded, and we know  that the call has already been heeded in other important  sectors, Liberal Party friends are accompanying us in this  campaign. Independent sectors are accompanying us in this  campaign. I think the country believes in something more than  the simple political programs of one party or another. What we  need to present is a true government program, with national  coverage, which will allow us -- everyone in Colombia -- to  begin working on a political program in search of the  development we desire so much in Colombia. This is the  invitation we have extended to Conservatives, Liberals, and  independents, and we are certain that with all of their help and  effort we will consolidate the political program we started  yesterday.    [Arizmendi] What have you calculated to be the cost of your  political campaign, Dr. Pastrana?    [Pastrana] The truth is that I am not familiar with the  issue. This information is known by those who handle the  financial aspects of the campaign. I think this is a very good  question for (Dr. Kelskey), who is in charge of this. I believe  that as a candidate my job is to go out and tour the country and  continue to talk with the people. This is what I began doing  today with my trip to Medellin and Antioquia.    [Reporter] Within eight days the Conservative Party  convention will be held, summoned by the directorates that came  together after remaining apart right up until a few months ago.  This convention will probably proclaim you as the official  Conservative Party presidential candidate. What will be your  attitude in light of this proclamation?    [Pastrana] We truly hope to receive the support of the  Conservative Party. At the October convention we were asked to  run as a national candidate. On 18 February, the party will  decide which candidate it will back in the next elections. The  truth is that I hope the Conservative Party gives me its  support, and not only the Conservative Party, but also my  Liberal Party friends and the independents. I insist that we  can consolidate the political program I officially presented  yesterday.    [Arizmendi] Will you allow the Conservative Party to exploit  your image and candidacy?    [Pastrana] No, no, the truth is that today the country, if  it  has anything clear, Dario, is that we are presenting a national  candidacy. Logically, I want and trust I will receive my  party's support, but we will continue with the political program  -- a national program and plan that goes beyond the party.    [Reporter] Are you willing to engage in a dialogue with  rebel  candidates such as Rodrigo Marin, Gabriel Melo, and the others  who have said they will put up a fight to the very end?    [Pastrana] If they have said they will put up a fight to the  very end it will be difficult. Given such circumstances, it is  important that next Friday -- when the Conservative Party,  through the method it has chosen, elects a candidate or  candidates by [words indistinct] -- I gain the Conservative  Party's support. I believe this is important; my goal is to  obtain the support of the Conservative Party.    [Arizmendi] What is your position on the process that is  beginning to unfold in the country? This is in reference to the  surrender to justice and negotiations with members of the Cali  cartel.    [Pastrana] Dario, I hope that this endeavor will be  realized.  Nevertheless, I believe that we Colombians are waiting to be  told what the final goal of this process is. At least from what  we have heard in the media, the goal is peace, and, therefore, I  believe it is positive. The truth of the matter is that I have  been very clear in this regard. I believe the policy of  surrendering to justice is sound and good as long as it is the  criminals who surrender to justice and not justice that  surrenders to the criminals.    [Arizmendi] In the Juanchaco case, do you believe that the  president of the Republic and the defense minister have told the  truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth to the  Colombia people?    [Pastrana] The president of the Republic has said that the  information on the issue was scant, and this is why I believe it  was important to accept this and clarify the matter.    [Arizmendi] Mr. Pastrana, thank you very much for your  discussion with Emisoras Caracol. Our microphones are at your  disposal, as the Colombians have the right to information. Will  there be equal opportunity for the various media in covering  your political campaign?    [Pastrana] We expect the opposite will be true. We hope  there will be balanced coverage in the media of our activities.  In this way, we will be able to engage in a good electoral  struggle awaited by all Colombians.    [Arizmendi] Do you believe that up until now the media has  been fair in handling your political activity and your campaign?    [Pastrana] Yes, Yes, Dario, I believe that to a great extent  they have been fair. This is why we hope that now that the  process has been initiated [words indistinct] our name, we will  have the opportunity, not only through Emisoras Caracol, but  also through the various other media, to present to the  Colombian people what we think and how we expect to resolve the  nation's problems.    [Arizmendi] When I asked what happened to you with the Santo  Domingo Group, it was to give you an opportunity to clarify this  incident on the airwaves, directly to the nation. I understand  it is not a serious incident and it does not have significant  repercussions. But when matters are not explained, as happened  in Juanchaco, when the whole truth is not told, then the people  start speculating. They think: What could have happened? What  could have they told each other? How did they hurt each other?    I understand that a serious incident did not take place,  regardless of whether the dispute is ongoing, and regardless of  any type of decision you may have made. Nevertheless, as a  reporter, I believe it would be good for the nation to know why  the Santo Domingo Group and Andres Pastrana had a falling out.  What happened? What is behind the group's attitudes, which have  started to give way to other attitudes?    [Pastrana] What attitudes are you talking about?    [Arizmendi] For example, it has been said that you want  nothing to do with the Santo Domingo Group, that nothing will be  demanded from the Santo Domingo Group, but that, eventually,  requests will be made to other sectors.    [Pastrana] I am surprised by your question. If I am not  mistaken, I believe it was through Caracol that I heard a  communique from the group's president with regard to the issue  that you are presenting. Theoretically, in that communique  maybe everything that happened was not explained, but perhaps  the president of the Santo Domingo Group wanted to give his side  of the story.    [Arizmendi] Very well, Mr. Pastrana, I hope the campaign  will  be conducted in a respectful manner, respecting the rules of the  game for the good of democracy and the good of the nation.</p>

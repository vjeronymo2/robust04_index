			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Oslo approves wider oil search Norway cleared the way for future oil prospecting off its southern coast yesterday despite strong opposition from neighbouring Sweden. The Labour government won a deal with the opposition to allow exploration in the Skagerrak strait, but agreed to make further environmental studies before starting drilling. The opposition Conservative party backed the plan in return for a government promise to review controversial rules allowing the state to raise its stake in profitable oil and gas fields. The new exploration areas will open up 16 per cent more of Norway's continental shelf for prospecting, making it possible to drill under 56 per cent of the waters off the coast. Norway, western Europe's biggest oil producer, currently pumps some 2.5m barrels a day, mostly from the North Sea. Output, however, is expected to fall in few years unless new discoveries are made. Sweden, fearing pollution from oil prospecting in the waters between itself, Norway and Denmark, has requested inter-government talks before a decision is made. Norway's state pollution board has sharply criticised previous studies of the consequences of opening Skagerrak and areas off mid-Norway for exploration, calling them inadequate.</p>

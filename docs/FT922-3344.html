			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Kredietbank extends overseas network KREDIETBANK, which usually presents itself as the most regional of the three big Belgian banks, wants to put on a more international face, Reuter reports from Brussels. Announcing the opening of new branch offices in Manchester, Dublin, Maastricht, Berlin, Paris and Moscow, Mr Marcel Cockaerts, chairman, said: 'We want to grow in concentric circles (around Belgium).' The bank wants to build a network of subsidiaries in neighbouring countries and a presence in other countries if warranted. The new policy is already reflected in the balance sheet: at the end of March, 47.1 per cent of non-consolidated assets were foreign, up from 43 per cent a year ago and 38 per cent in 1987. 'In volume, foreign transactions are now as important as domestic ones,' Mr Cockaerts said.</p>

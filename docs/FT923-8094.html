			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / N American free trade deal opens up 'new era': US, Canada and Mexico agree on pact after 14 months of negotiations NORTH AMERICAN leaders yesterday hailed the completion of negotiations to bring together the US, Canada and Mexico as one of the world's two largest free trade areas. President George Bush said a 'new era' opened up with the historic agreement, creating a powerful trading zone of 360m consumers and annual economic output worth about Dollars 6,000bn. Its formation has been spurred on by plans to widen free trade in western Europe, with the eventual setting up of a 19-nation European Economic Area of 380m consumers. It reflects North American worries about the deadlock in the Uruguay Round of talks on world trade liberalisation and concern about the possible emergence of an inward-looking 'Fortress Europe'. The North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) was stitched together in 14 months of talks, ending with 10 days of intense parlaying in a Washington hotel. The US pressed for completion in time for the Republican party convention which will re-nominate Mr Bush for president next week. Appearing in the White House rose garden with Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative, Mr Bush said Nafta was 'part of my long-term economic growth plan'. He said booming trade with Mexico had already created 600,000 US jobs and more would be created. Nafta will phase out tariffs and other trade barriers between the US, Canada and Mexico over 15 years and is expected to lead to restructuring of whole industries. It is an unprecedented 'mixed marriage' linking two industrialised powers with a third world nation. It joins the capital, technology and creativity of the US and Canada with the cheap labour and resources of Mexico. But Nafta still has to be approved by the legislatures of all three countries and it faces some strong opposition, especially in Canada and among US congressmen who fear loss of jobs to Mexico and lower environmental standards. Mr Bush said Nafta broke new ground for trade pacts by including 'stringent provisions' on the environment. But he gave no promise of retraining or assistance programmes for the thousands of US workers - mostly high-wage factory workers - likely to lose their jobs as companies are drawn south to the Mexico-US border area. Under Nafta, Mexico for the first time will open its market to US cars, light trucks and motor vehicle parts. After 15 years, the agreement will guarantee total market access in agriculture. It is the first trade agreement to eliminate quotas on textiles among its parties. It is also the first to create free trade in services, opening Mexico's telecoms and insurance markets. In a vigorous defence of Nafta, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico said it would generate more jobs and better pay for Mexicans. But the benefits would not come immediately, he warned. Nafta was not a 'magic formula to resolve all our problems', he said. Nafta reflects a radical change in Mexico's economic and foreign policy in the past five years. Once deeply suspicious of both the US and free trade, Mexico is now embracing both. Mr Salinas said the treaty would make Mexico one of the centres of the world economy. Mr Michael Wilson, Canadian trade minister, called the Nafta deal a 'very good agreement' for his country. But many Canadians blame the three-year-old US-Canada free trade agreement for job losses and other economic ills and fear a further shake-up from the wider pact with Mexico.

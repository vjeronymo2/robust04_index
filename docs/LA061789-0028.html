			<p><P> June 17, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> EXPOS CONTINUE TO SUPPORT SMITH WITH OFFENSE  </P> <P> Right-hander Bryn Smith, who has been backed with an average of more than six  runs a game this season by his Montreal teammates, was once again the recipient  of timely hitting and scoring in the Expos' 8-5 victory over the Chicago Cubs  Friday night at Montreal.  </P> <P> The win, the Expos' fourth straight over Chicago this season, moved Montreal  into first place in the NL East by a half-game.  </P> <P> Hubie Brooks and Andres Galarraga each had three hits and two runs batted in.  </P> <P> Smith (7-2) allowed five runs and nine hits in eight-plus innings. Tim Burke  got the last three outs for his 14th save after Smith allowed singles to the  first two batters in the ninth.  </P> <P> Brooks doubled home two runs and scored on Mike Fitzgerald's single as Montreal  scored three runs in the first inning off Paul Kilgus (5-6).  </P> <P> The Cubs scored twice in the fifth on an RBI single by Dwight Smith and a  run-scoring double by Ryne Sandberg. Sandberg also added his 10th home run in  the eighth inning.  </P> <P> New York 15, Philadelphia 11 -- The Mets squandered an eight-run first-inning  lead, then outlasted the Phillies on a rainy night in Philadelphia.  </P> <P> Mackey Sasser put the Mets ahead, 12-11, with a two-run, pinch double in the  eighth inning after the Phillies had taken an 11-10 lead in the seventh on a  double by Von Hayes and a triple by Juan Samuel.  </P> <P> The Mets sent 13 batters to the plate in the first inning and scored eight runs  on eight hits against Bruce Ruffin.  </P> <P> But the Phillies came back against David Cone and scored five runs in the  bottom of the first.  </P> <P> Randy Myers (6-2) pitched 2 2/3 innings in relief for the victory. Steve  Bedrosian (2-3) was the loser.  </P> <P> Houston 3, San Diego 1 -- Bill Doran and Glenn Davis hit home runs, and Jim  Clancy (5-4) allowed five hits and no runs in 6 2/3 innings at San Diego.  </P> <P> Dave Smith pitched the ninth inning for his 13th save.  </P> <P> Gerald Young opened the game with a double against Ed Whitson (9-4), and one  out later, Doran homered.  </P> <P> Davis' 15th homer, leading off the fourth inning, was barely inside the  left-field foul pole and sparked an argument that led to the ejection of Padre  Manager Jack McKeon.  </P> <P> St. Louis 6, Pittsburgh 2 -- Scott Terry (5-6) allowed two runs and four hits  in seven innings, and Milt Thompson drove in two runs to lead the Cardinals at  St. Louis.  </P> <P> It was the Cardinals' third straight win and the ninth in their last 11 games.  The Pirates have lost nine of their last 13.  </P> <P> Pirate starter Randy Kramer (1-3) led, 2-1, going into the seventh inning, when  the Cardinals scored four runs.  </P> <P> Reliever Neal Heaton gave up run-scoring singles to Milt Thompson and Ozzie  Smith before giving way to Doug Bair. Two more runs scored on a passed ball by  catcher Junior Ortiz and a wild pitch by Bair.  </P> <P> Cincinnati 5, San Francisco 4 -- Pinch-hitter Eric Davis hit reliever Goose  Gossage's first pitch for a two-run home run in the ninth inning, his 12th of  the season, to cap a three-run rally and give the Reds the win at San  Francisco.  </P> <P> Todd Benzinger started the comeback with a leadoff double off Craig Lefferts,  who replaced starter Rick Reuschel. Reuschel had been seeking his 12th win.  </P> <P> With one out, Paul O'Neill singled to score Benzinger. It was O'Neill's second  RBI of the game and 10th of the season against the Giants.  </P> <P> Reliever Norm Charlton (3-0) pitched a hitless eighth inning for the win, and  John Franco took over in the ninth to earn his league-leading 18th save.  </P></p>

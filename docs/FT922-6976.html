			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Commercial Union Yesterday's placing of Pounds 100m of irredeemable preference shares is the clearest sign yet that CU is moving off the back foot. The company was forced to become risk averse in the mid 1980s after disastrous losses in the US, a policy which, as it happens, enabled it to avoid most of the mortgage guarantee problems now haunting its competitors. Emboldened by a more encouraging first quarter, CU is now in a position to take a more aggressive stance on new premium growth. Shareholders might not have been easily persuaded to put up the money themselves, and would certainly have demanded a heavy price. But they are still entitled to ask whether the chosen instrument best suits their interests. The advantage is that the shares will count as capital for solvency margin purposes - taking this ratio from 41 per cent at the end of the first quarter to 44 per cent - while the gross rate of 11.55 per cent is almost a half-point cheaper than that recently paid by Halifax building society on a similar issue. The claim that ordinary shareholders' returns are being attractively geared up will depend on whether the UK general insurance cycle really is on the turn. Certainly the tentative conclusion from the composite insurance results of the last week or so is that better premium rates are at last sticking in most classes of business. The recovery, though, looks set to be long and slow and the risk for CU is in picking up dud accounts. Its UK general insurance premiums increased by no less than 26 per cent in the first quarter, against a 2 per cent fall at General Accident and a single-figure increase at Royal.</p>

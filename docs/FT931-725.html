			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Survey of Singapore (5): Technocrat from the private sector  -Dr Richard Hu, finance minister, is a rarity among politicans an apolitical politician. Though an MP since 1984, Dr Hu is first and foremost a technocrat, groomed in the private sector and eventually parachuted into high office. That was 10 years ago. 'One thing with politics is the loss of personal freedom . . . I've been so long out of the private sector I can hardly remember what it was like.' Dr Hu, 66, gained his Ph. D. in chemical engineering from Birmingham University and went on to lecture in England before returning to Singapore in 1960. For more than 20 years he was with Shell, rising to become chief executive of their operations first in Malaysia and then in Singapore. Dr Hu's position would be envied by many of his colleagues round the world. Since the mid 1980s Singapore has been running budget surpluses. With foreign exchange reserves officially put at USDollars 40bn Singapore's fiscal position does not cause the finance minister too many sleepless nights. Furthermore the nature of Singapore government - with its emphasis on a unified, corporate approach - allows Dr Hu to manage his ministry in very much the same way as he would the finances of a giant corporation. 'The political part of this job is much less intense than it would be in the UK or elsewhere,' says Dr Hu. Nonetheless Dr Hu shares the views of Singapore's top leadership when it comes to key policy issues. New tax structures were recently introduced, with corporate and personal taxes lowered. The central aim of the changes is to keep Singapore competitive. 'The competition for investment is going to be even greater in future. Hitherto closed economies are opening up . . . protectionism is raising its head everywhere, there's a great shortage of capital. Making our investment climate more attractive is crucial.' Dr Hu is keenly aware of the changes taking place in the region, with Singapore's neighbours already nibbling away at the island republic's export markets. 'We now consider Malaysia as one of our major competitors. It's extraordinary how Malaysia has grown its industrial sector so fast.' Dr Hu went to China in 1985 and returned again recently. 'The change is amazing. The money is trickling down and consumer demand is shooting up. The same thing will happen in Vietnam.' Dr Hu feels there is a good chance of an economic upturn in the US - still Singapore's main export market. He feels Japan has a great capacity for recovery - if it can solve its political problems. But monetary developments in Europe are viewed with dismay. 'One of the unfortunate by products of liberalising financial systems is that the door is opened to speculators. As we've seen, they can knock central banks down. Modern communications aids the process. It's so easy to do now. That's one of the reasons we are reluctant to free the Singapore dollar.' Singapore has one of the highest per capita savings rates. Dr Hu defends what is criticised as an over-cautious fiscal regime but liberalisation of savings is now being investigated. 'As long as you preserve financial independence half your problems are solved . . . if you borrow too much you lose sovereignty.'</p>

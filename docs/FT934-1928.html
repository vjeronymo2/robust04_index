			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Daily Mail The sight of Viscount Rothermere blithely flouting the worldwide trend towards share enfranchisement would normally induce fund managers to foam at the mouth with apoplexy. Perversely, Daily Mail and General Trust's bonus issue, which cuts the proportion of voting shares to total equity from 50 per cent to 5 per cent, was greeted with enthusiasm. Shareholders bought into Daily Mail in the knowledge that the Rothermere family's voting power would never be diluted. The scrip issue improves the liquidity of the stock, which at Pounds 116 a share had grown too heavy. Given the performance of the A shares, such equanimity is understandable. Mr Rupert Murdoch's recent super share proposals for News Corporation are not analogous. The Rothermere interests have no intention of expanding Daily Mail's total equity base nor selling their allocation of A shares. Moreover, Daily Mail's newspaper business is performing soundly and is beginning to benefit from the patchy recovery in advertising spend. The Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday have even been able to lift cover prices without undue damage to circulation. The full year's numbers will be depressed by heavy spend on the launch costs of new supplements and investments in a rag bag of other media interests, ranging from GWR Radio to a Hungarian provincial newspaper. But the company remains one of the highest-rated newspaper groups. Its challenge is now to diversify into fruitful areas without diluting its quality of earnings. It would do well to match the success of Euromoney, where its initial investment of Pounds 6,000 in 1969 is now worth some Pounds 250m.</p>

			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR STAMPS: U.S.-SOVIET EXCHANGE IS SUGGESTED  </P> <P> Question: I haven't collected stamps systematically since high school, but I  still find them fascinating. Last summer I joined 250 Americans and 200 Soviets  for a peace walk from Leningrad to Moscow. Along the way I bought three small  albums of Soviet stamps.  </P> <P> It occurred to me that it would be a good confidence-building step if stamp  collectors in the United States and the U.S.S.R. corresponded and exchanged  stamps. Especially young people. I believe the thousands of stamp collectors in  both countries could do a lot toward lasting peace and international  cooperation.  </P> <P> What are some things I could do to get this idea off the ground? -- B.L.  </P> <P> Answer: It is legal in both countries to exchange stamps by mail between  collectors in the United States and the Soviet Union. I once carried on a  3-year correspondence with a gentleman in the Ukraine, exchanging stamps and  post cards as well as information about such subjects as our jobs and  relatives.  </P> <P> Under Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet Union has relaxed some  of its "closed society" rules a bit, but you'll find mailing letters to and  from Russia to be somewhat different from correspondence to Western Europe.  Mail often gets lost or delayed for reasons that aren't always clear.  </P> <P> Still, your idea has merit. Try writing to International Pen Friends, 9 Porter  Road, Wolcott, Conn. 06716. Also: Papyrus, 7301-VD Jefferson N.E., No. A239,  Albuquerque, N.M. 87109, and enclose a stamped envelope for a reply. Also:  Philatelic Department, V/O Mezhdunarodnaya Kniga, Moscow 121200, U.S.S.R., and  tell them you want to trade stamps with Soviet citizens.  </P> <P> Q: How can I verify if a stamp dealer in a foreign country is legitimate and  ethical? -- R.A.  </P> <P> A: This is hard without trying a few sample orders to see what kind of service  and value you get. There is an organization that many foreign dealers belong  to, and you could write to them and ask if they are aware of the dealer you are  investigating. Contact Philatelic Trader's Society, 27 John Adams St., London  WC2N 6HZ, England. Enclose a dollar to help pay for their reply.  </P> <P> Q: A pen pal in the Philippines sent me a set of stamps illustrating President  Aquino and other subjects, including a parade and the military. Do these have  value? -- T.N.  </P> <P> A: Issued in May, 1986, this set is too recent to be of great value: 85 cents  mint, 43 cents used for the set of four.  </P> <P> Krause, a member of several national stamp-collecting organizations, cannot  answer mail personally but will respond to philatelic questions of general  interest in this column. Do not telephone. Write to Your Stamps, You section,  The Times, Times Mirror Square, Los Angeles, Calif. 90053.  </P> <P> </P></p>

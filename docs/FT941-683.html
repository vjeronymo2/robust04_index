			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / 2001: a Tory odyssey Every government needs a sense of direction. A cabinet without focus can lose its way, as the then Mr Harold Wilson discovered after 1966 and 1974. Parties have always been happier when united around an agreed overall objective. Building a 'socialist' society seemed at the time to justify the post-1945 Labour government. Its Conservative successor chanted 'bonfire of controls' as wartime rationing was swept aside. In the 1980s the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher plausibly described what she was up to as rolling back the frontiers of the state. A suitable purpose for a British administration in the 1990s would be to produce a properly educated next generation, equipped to compete in global markets. To say this, and to know the unhappy fate of Mr Kenneth Baker's well-intentioned plans to reform publicly financed teaching, is to weep. It is not a thought to dwell upon. An alternative national aim could be to place the United Kingdom at the heart of Europe, the corollary being that the effectiveness of many British institutions would be enhanced by learning from their French, German or other counterparts. Such an open-minded approach is not possible, given the prevailing mood in the Conservative party. Unbelievably, it is still arguing about how many votes are needed to stop continental Europeans from acting contrary to what Tories deem to be British interests. With a sigh, we must scratch heart-of-Europe from our banner. All is not lost. If no mission statement is available, the next best glue for a polity is a project, preferably one in which many can be involved, and all can feel pride. The Citizen's Charter was intended to be such an enterprise, but it has not set the nation's heart a-flutter. Never fear. Two other possibilities - the millennium celebrations and the liberalisation of the media and communications businesses - could be exploited. They are not necessarily unrelated. Either or both could rekindle optimism in a society whose spirit has been cast down by the double weight of an unfortunate government and an uninspiring opposition. The first of these undertakings is in the hands of Mr Peter Brooke, the secretary for the national heritage; the second depends to a degree on his department's input. This is curious. Mr Brooke is a high Tory, the son of a much-maligned former home secretary. Once chairman of the Conservatives, he camouflages his intelligence by affecting the manner of an old buffer. Reconciled to the backbenches, he was recalled to the cabinet in 1992 after the enforced departure from the government of Mr David Mellor. Many of us expressed doubt about Mr Brooke's elevation then. Yet by a strange quirk of politics this 19th century figure has become the impresario of two potential star turns of the second half of the 90s - the national lottery and one of its beneficiaries, the millennium fund. He is also one of four ministers who plan to deregulate the production and dissemination of information and entertainment. The other three are the prime minister, the trade secretary and the chancellor. If all goes well, the winner of the lottery contract will be announced in time for the dice to be rolling by the autumn. That would produce income for Mr Brooke's millennium committee. He expects it to rake in about Pounds 500m between 1995 and 2000, but acknowledges that the sum could be twice that. He tells himself that the Treasury will keep its promise not to grab the cash and run. The committee is already receiving outline bids, although it has not yet clarified its own thinking. It will probably finance monuments, millennium events, and bursaries. What remains open is the unifying theme behind these activities. The 1851 Great Exhibition, for which Prince Albert took the role now occupied by Mr Brooke, demonstrated the industrial might of the British empire. A century later its successor expressed postwar optimism, in shuttered concrete. It is not clear what inevitably more muted sound the 2000-01 trumpets will emit, but Mr Brooke's contribution, which will surely be curtailed before long, may be to make it at least harmonious. His eye is on a respectful representation of British architecture. There are other possibilities, such as contributing to world culture. I am sure that the heritage secretary would entertain the suggestion that his fund should finance the restoration of the bombed library in Sarajevo. The first cheque could go out before Christmas. Such a gesture would be European without being divisive. Not so the 'information superhighway'. Neither wholly British nor entirely European, this next-century industry will be planet-wide, dominated by large players. Mind you, it is not as new as Vice-President Albert Gore makes it sound. More than 10 years ago Mr Baker - he of the 1988 education act - was junior minister for information technology. He walked with a gleam in his eyes, talking about linking every house with fibre-optic cables. He sounded mad. Perhaps he was. It has yet to be demonstrated that the market for new and recycled films, videos, digitalised information, and multi-media spectaculars is as large as the dreams of Mr Gore and his like. Mr Brooke and his fellow-ministers have first to settle little British difficulties. Next up is the question of to what extent newspapers can own TV stations, and vice-versa. This is a matter in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has an interest. I suspect the government's broadcasting bill, when it comes, will liberalise, but not so much that its 17-seat majority in the House of Commons is destabilised. Mr Brooke had the parliamentary balance in mind when he cautiously permitted TV companies to acquire one another. This Tory pragmatism should not be laughed away. It has its beneficial side. For example, Mr Brooke's instinct is to preserve British origination of TV news about Britain. That is not perfect obeisance to the market. The issue must be resolved: Mr Michael Heseltine muses expansively about a liberated BBC working hand in glove with a British Telecom freed from prior restraints on its activities. Come the millennium, they could roam the information superhighway together, as British Airways does the skies. In skilful hands, Mr Heseltine's perhaps, this kind of talk could be as intoxicating as 'the white heat of the technological revolution' sounded 30 years ago.</p>

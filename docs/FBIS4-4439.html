			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Fel V. Maragay] </F>   [Text] President Ramos inaugurated yesterday the $128  million diesel power plant at the Subic Bay Free Port which will  boost power reserves by 116 megawatts and further minimize the  possibility of brownouts during the summer months.    The opening of the plant, the chief executive said,  disproves  the apprehensions of some quarters that Luzon and other parts of  the country may be hit by power outages lasting about five hours  daily during the dry months.    "Today, we also deliver a strong message to our people that  there will be enough electric power this summer to meet the  needs of households and large industrial users alike, and  debunk, through action and accomplishment, the delusions and  fears of some doubting Thomases in our midst that power  sufficiency will not be possible at this time," Mr. Ramos said.    This is the fifth power plant to be inaugurated by the chief  executive in three weeks.    Earlier, Mr. Ramos opened four power facilities with a  combined generating capacity of 285 MW -- three plants for Luzon  and one for Mindanao.    The three power projects in Luzon with a combined capacity  of  240.73 MW which the President had switched on were the Kalayaan  Pump Storage Power Plant Unit II in Laguna de Bay (150 MW), the  Macban Binary Power Plant between Mt. Makiling and Mt. Banahaw  in Laguna (15.73 MW) and the Bacman I Unit II and Bacman II Unit  I geothermal plant (75 MW) in the boundary of Albay and Sorsogon.    The Subic Power Plant was built by Enron Power Philippines  Corp. in partnership with the Rizal Commercial Banking Corp.  headed by Chairman Alfonso Yuchengco, House of Investments, and  Pan Malayan Investment and Management Corp. under the  build-operate-transfer (BOT) scheme.    The president said it was propitious that the Enron power  plant was inaugurated on Palm Sunday, marking the "light-filled  entry" of Jesus Christ into Jerusalem.    "This power plant comes as a fitting reminder that from  suffering comes redemption and that we can triumph if we have  the will, and call upon God's help to achieve," he said.    Mr. Ramos recalled that he had vowed last year to end power  outages by December. He said he had also promised that in the  following months, his administration will take further steps to  strengthen the power sector and build up the power reserves to  cope with the peak demands of summer.    "We have made good on that promise," the president said.  "And beyond that, continue to reinforce that commitment by  augmenting our power reserves -- because the people deserve  nothing less.    "The full operation of the Enron plant will make the Subic  Free Port self-sufficient in power and therefore more attractive  to investors.    "We moved closer to our vision of transforming the Subic Bay  Free Port into one of the major launching pads of our economic  take-off with every company and facility getting established,"  the president said.    This is the second power project of Enron in the country.  The first was the 105-MW power plant built for the Batangas  Power Corp. in Pinamucan, Batangas.    Mr. Ramos noted that the United States-based Enron Corp.,  the  parent firm of Enron Power Philippines, Corp., operates the  longest pipeline in North America, and has constructed and is  operating many power plants in four continents of the world.    The president said it is "heartening to know" that Enron has  seen fit to strike a partnership with the Yuchengco Group, which  he described as a "very stable, well respected group of Filipino  companies."    "The Enron-Yuchengco partnership speaks well of Enron's  commitment to a long-term presence in the Philippines and of the  Yuchengco Group's willingness to venture into the promising area  of power generation," he said.    Under the agreement signed by the National Power Corp.  [Napocor] and Enron, the 116-MW plant, with a life span of 40  years will be operated by Enron for 15 years after which it  shall be turned over to Napocor without cost.    Present during the inauguration were Subic Bay Metropolitan  Authority [SBMA] Chairman Richard Gordon, and his wife  Catherine, Enron officials led by its president and Chief  Operating Officer Kenneth Lay, SBMA personnel and volunteers,  and other government officials.</p>

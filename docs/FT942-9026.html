			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Low safety standards cause alarm: There is 'a strong temptation to cut corners . . . we have to make it unprofitable' An alarming picture of low safety standards at sea and the environmental risks to marine life and the shoreline posed by poorly maintained tankers and other vessels is painted by the report of the Donaldson inquiry. The inquiry was prompted by the grounding of the oil tanker Braer, but 67 significant pollution-threatening marine incidents - more than one a week - were recorded while the inquiry was sitting, revealing the extent of the potential risk to the coastline. Among those incidents were: The Havkong, a Bermuda registered carrier of liquefied petroleum gas, broke adrift from its moorings in the Firth of Forth in winds of up to 80 knots. It nearly collided with another tanker but 'by a combination of good fortune and good seamanship' was successfully anchored. The Freja Svea, a Danish-owned tanker, was trapped in Tees Bay in deteriorating weather conditions and unable to put to sea. The Gran Piedra, a Cuban-registered cargo ship, went adrift near the Isles of Scilly when its engines failed because of poor-quality fuel. 'A classic example of a near miss', the vessel drifted near the isles before anchoring. The report says high standards of ship design, maintenance and operation are expensive and vast overcapacity has made the shipping industry extremely competitive. 'This produces low or negative profit margins and a strong temptation to cut corners, resisted by some, but far too few, shipowners. In one way or another we have to make it unprofitable to cut corners.' Prime responsibility for the safety of ships lies with the states whose flags they fly and the classification societies which carry out inspections. Some 'flag states' do their job well, including a number providing 'flags of convenience', such as Liberia, the flag state of the Braer, 'but others quite clearly do an inadequate job'. Lord Donaldson and his team urge the International Maritime Organisation, the United Nations body responsible for international shipping agreements, to do more to persuade flag states to improve performance, but says Britain and its European partners cannot wait for changes. International conventions place the first duty to ensure ship safety on the flag states, but the north-west European countries already have a tough system of inspection of vessels calling at their ports. In 1992 nearly half of the 15,000 north-west European port inspections revealed deficiencies, and 600 vessels were in such a poor state that they had to be detained until repaired. 'If instead of ships the inspections had been of aircraft, there would have been a public outcry.' The report proposes that vessels visiting ports for the first time should report for inspection and thereafter give advance warning at least once a year - more frequently if they are tankers - for a possible further inspection. If enough faults were found they would have to report every time they approached a port for the next 12 months. In severe cases, substandard vessels could face delays before being allowed to load or unload. The arrival of one substandard vessel could trigger an inspection of the owner's entire fleet. It also calls for an increase in the number of salvage tugs available to respond to emergencies, with costs shared by the private and public sectors. These two suggestions should form the 'bedrock of the defence of these shores', Lord Donaldson said, but his report also identifies the improved supply of information as a way of raising standards. More information about the quality of fleets would allow charterers and their brokers to make more informed choices about which vessels are most likely to reach their destination in one piece while insurance underwriters would adjust their premiums. Safer Ships, Cleaner Seas. HMSO. Pounds 38  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                TOWARDS SAFER SHIPS AND CLEANER SEAS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Problems highlighted by the Braer disaster Inadequate system of inspection for ships' design, maintenance and operation standards. Insufficient provision of emergency assistance facilities: not enough salvage tugs available. Polluting or potentially polluting ships are not easy to identify, even in daylight.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Recommendations  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Selected ships to give 48 hours notice of arrival at most European ports where they would be thoroughly inspected. Information on sub-standard ships held by charterers, insurers, agents and regulatory bodies should be shared more widely. Ships should carry a unique recognition symbol prominently on sides and deck and, longer term, be fitted with transponders for automatic electronic identification. Random aerial surveillance of shipping lanes. Establishment of Marine Environmental High Risk Areas (MEHRAs). Publication of a Seaway Code listing MEHRAs and reminding ships masters of practical steps to reduce risk of pollution. Polluters and potential polluters should pay more towards costs of prevention. Increased number of salvage tugs around coast.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

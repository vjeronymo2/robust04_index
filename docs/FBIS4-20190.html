			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yavuz Baydar] </F>   [Text] Ankara--The Turkish press and media, hit hard by the  escalating economic crisis, continue to sack hundreds of  journalists without any advance warning.    Reports from media circles say that at least 2,000  journalists, reporters and other workers involved in the media  have lost their jobs in the course of the last two weeks, as a  result of attempts by leading media companies to reduce the size  of their workforce.    The reason for this "shrinking campaign" is reported to be  the increasing price of paper, higher production costs and the  dramatic decrease in advertising, caused by the economic turmoil  in Turkey. Most leading newspapers are now published with fewer  pages than before.    Also, the new Radio-TV Bill, which strictly limits the  number  of commercials and obliges the media to respect copyright, has  provoked a feeling of concern about the future among media  moguls.  <H5>  Chain of Sackings </H5>   TGRT-TV and TURKIYE daily, owned by the IHLAS group, have so  far sacked at least 700 journalists. Some of them were  reportedly asked to provide technical and economic services, a  proposal which they rejected.    ATV and SABAH daily have by now dismissed at least 500  people. Sources within SABAH say the newspaper is facing the  worst crisis ever, and that a new wave of redundancies seem  inevitable. "Almost half of the 3,000 people employed risk  losing their jobs at the moment," one source said.    Among the journalists who lost their jobs recently are Refik  Durbas, coordinator of the arts page, and Sebnem Senyener, New  York correspondent.    The other two newspaper giants, HURRIYET and MILLIYET, have  also sacked a proportion of their staff. It is reported that a  total of 700 people have been forced to go.    Kanal D, a private TV channel owned jointly by  MILLIYET-owner  Aydin Dogan and the DOGUS group, is confronted with a crisis as  well. It is reported that workers' wages have been frozen and  recruitments suspended.    Kanal 6, a private TV channel owned by Ahmet Ozal, sacked  last week 241 of its personnel in the Programming, Advertising,  and Technical Departments. Kanal 6 is reported to have huge  debts, and CUMHURIYET daily reported last Sunday that it was on  sale. There seems to be a great deal of turbulence within the  semi-official ANATOLIA news agency as well. They are reported  to have sacked between 57 and 300 journalists.  <H5>  Political Interference </H5>   With the increasing anxiety in the ANATOLIA news agency, two  journalists are said to have been sacked by "order of the prime  minister," following their articles on the economic austerity  package, reported CUMHURIYET newspaper on Tuesday.    Emine Cal and Fatma Orhan Coskunoglu are reported to have  been pressured by Mehmet Bican, a member of ANATOLIA's  administrative board and the prime minister's press adviser, to  disclose their sources of information. When the reporters  refused to do so, Bican asked the board to dismiss them, saying,  "It is the wish of the prime minister." ANATOLIA fired them on  the grounds that "their articles were causing trouble for the  agency."  <H5>  High Fines for InterStar TV </H5>   Cem Uzan, owner of the private TV channel  InterStar,--together with two TV presenters and five  high-ranking executives of InterStar--was fined a total of TL 2  billion, on the grounds that the party propaganda and insults  broadcast on the television channel had been a breach of the  Election Law.</p>

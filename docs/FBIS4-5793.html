			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 14 KYODO -- World growth and job  problems will top discussions at a series of international  financial meetings slated later this month in Washington, a  senior Finance Ministry official said Thursday [14 April].    The meetings will "center on the issues of still high  unemployment among Group of Seven (G-7) industrial nations and  on stable world growth, particularly with European nations still  not in good shape," Vice Finance Minister Jiro Saito told a news  meeting.    A spate of international gatherings of financial leaders are  scheduled in Washington late this month, led by the semiannual  meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Interim  Committee, the Joint Development Committee of the IMF and the  World Bank.    An international financial source said finance ministers and  central bankers from the G-7 nations are expected to meet April  24 before the gatherings.    The G-7 nations are Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy,  Japan and the United States.    Saito said he is yet not certain about a bilateral meeting  between Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii and U.S. Treasury  Secretary Lloyd Bentsen.</p>

			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / SPD to fight welfare cuts THE opposition Social Democratic Party in the German parliament yesterday rejected calls for cuts in social spending to control the soaring budget deficit, and proposed an alternative DM33bn (Pounds 13.4bn) savings package for the coming year. In spite of suggestions from some senior party figures that the huge social welfare budget can no longer be a 'taboo' for spending cuts, the party leadership seems determined to fight the government on the issue. The move would seem to put paid to any early attempt to negotiate a new cross-party 'solidarity pact' to curb state spending, and keep the central government budget deficit to a ceiling of DM70bn this year and in 1994. Senior finance officials believe that only with cross-party agreement can adequate savings be made in coming years to keep the deficit under control. Mrs Ingrid Matthaus-Maier, deputy leader of the SPD parliamentary group, and Mr Joachim Poss, its finance spokesman, yesterday spelt out their alternative plan for a DM33bn package of cuts and revenue increases which would avoid any social cuts. Key elements include a further DM3bn-5bn cuts in defence spending, DM910m in abolishing fuel subsidies for farmers, DM300m from the manned space exploration programme and nuclear research, and DM170m in reduced finance for the government's publicity apparatus. The SPD is proposing dismantling a series of tax allowances, totalling DM15bn a year, including cutting allowances on company entertainment, and abolishing the reimbursement of foreign taxation. It also wants to introduce a 'labour market surcharge' for those who pay no unemployment benefit, such as the self-employed, government servants, ministers and members of parliament. The plan is intended as an alternative to the DM20bn package of spending cuts which Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, is proposing. He is calling for reduced unemployment benefits and cuts in other sensitive social areas like child allowances and student grants. The 1994 budget has to be finalised by July 13, when it is to be presented to the cabinet.</p>

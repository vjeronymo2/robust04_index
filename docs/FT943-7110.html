			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Unloved and incompetent - Salespeople's professionalism comes under attack after an international survey Salesmen and women are commonly portrayed as unloved, foot-in-the-door creatures, whose superiors provide motivation principally in the form of alternate bouts of public humiliation and recognition. In recent weeks, salesforces have received an even worse press than usual, with revelations from the UK financial services sector of dodgy advice to clients, lack of training and poor management controls. Now there appears to be fresh evidence of incompetence - although salespeople have some of their own grouses, too, about the inefficiencies of their organisations. A survey conducted by Kinnaird Communications Group, a Glasgow-based consultancy, claims that only 5 per cent of field sales staff 'possess the requisite natural selling skills that make them stand out as professionals', while 35 per cent 'just manage to pay their way', leaving 'an astounding 60 per cent just there for the beer'. Kinnaird says it arrived at these figures after an exercise which involved: questioning about 1,000 salesmen and women operating in the UK, France, Italy and Germany; looking at sales records; and talking to chief executives, supervisors and customers. The findings, says Robert Kinnaird, managing director, were supplemented by observations over many years among clients' salesforces. The elite 5 per cent of salespeople achieve about five times the sales performance level of the poorest employees, while, according to Kinnaird, much of the rest 'have drifted into the profession, attracted by the freedom, car and expense account'. In contrast to these findings, around half of the mediocre and poor salespeople surveyed counted themselves as outstanding or good performers. The tiny portion of the day apparently spent face to face with potential customers is astonishing. Kinnaird calculates that, out the average salesperson's day, 42 per cent of the time is spent in the car, while 26 per cent is spent at home planning, having lunch, telephoning, writing reports and parking the car. That leaves less than one-third of the time on customers' premises. However, all but perhaps 5 per cent of that time will be taken up by fruitless 'cold' calls, waiting in reception, interruptions and, in the case of the poorest salespeople, inadequate advance planning and an excess of small talk. Much precious face-to-face time was found to be spent talking to people with no influence on the purchasing decision. An unproductive monthly call cycle, made up of 'tea and sympathy' visits, is the only outlet for salespeople 'to find solace or escape from what they regard as a very lonely existence,' says Kinnaird. Salespeople complain of inadequate marketing and advertising support for products from head office, poor sales literature, and products or services provided more cheaply by competitors. A particular irritation seems to be that few marketing managers or, indeed, chief executives, have any direct field sales experience. This point is endorsed by Paul Williams, a former sales director for Philip Morris cigarettes, and now a course director with the Chartered Institute of Marketing, the professional body which organises sales training. Says Williams: 'The bane of my life is the fact that most chief executives have a financial background - probably the worst background you can have to motivate salespeople. The way you get salespeople to respond is to create the right attitudes, emotions and feelings in them.' He also believes that Kinnaird's figure of 5 per cent for the sales elite is probably about right: what sets this upper tranche apart is charisma in a sales situation, he says. Apart from the elusive charisma, the other main qualities that make a successful salesperson are a sense of humour and good planning and preparation skills, says Williams. 'They certainly also need initiative, because nearly all of the time they're on their own, as well as a belief in their company and their products or services. They've got to believe in their colleagues - the people in accounts, marketing and distribution - and finally, they have to believe in themselves.' John Hunt, a professor at the London Business School who has assembled a vast databank of occupational profiles, adds to that list of qualities, physical energy, tenacity and resilience in the face of rejection. The salesperson's primary motivator is recognition, hence the 'religious events where everyone gets a prize one way or another', he says. It is not so much that effective sales staff like people but they enjoy 'the game of using their own interpersonal skills to hook someone on to their sale'. Fiona Rogers, the Chartered Institute of Marketing's own marketing director, says there are 'always going to be naturals, but the training of a salesman is absolutely critical. It's not just a question of product training in the features, benefits and uses of the product, but it's also about the techniques of selling. Good-quality training can override the lack of some of the personal skills'. As well as improving training, Rogers believes the value of the salesperson to the organisation is often not exploited. Her words will be welcomed by the unloved ranks of salespeople. 'They are your front-line people. They are a most valuable information source, not just on customer attitudes and preferences, and what's going on in the marketplace, but also what the environment is like for the competition.'</p>

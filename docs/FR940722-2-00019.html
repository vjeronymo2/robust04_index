			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Board has subsequently learned that Mr. Armenis is providing consulting services to LANL that may create a potential conflict of interest with his work for the Board. Specifically, Mr. Armenis assists the LANL staff in compiling complete development reports for weapons that are presently in the stockpile and in preparing final documentation for NTS tests that have been executed since none of the weapons have been thoroughly documented and final NTS device data has not been compiled. His efforts involve working with LANL engineers in the proper compilation of data to assure consistency in methods and to prevent the exclusion of critical details of this historical reconstruction of information. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board reviewed this situation and concluded that, even if the circumstances could give rise to a potential conflict of interest situation, it is nonetheless in the best interest of the Government to have Mr. Armenis continue to provide support to the Board for the reasons described below. Mr. Armenis possesses a comprehensive understanding of nuclear weapons assembly and dismantlement procedures based on his approximately forty years of direct involvement in these activities. He spent thirty years working at LANL as a design engineer and supervisor involved in the design and assembly of nuclear devices from 1948 through 1977. He also assisted in the technical management and administration of a LANL unit which was responsible for nuclear design, nuclear device assembly, production specifications liaison with DOE contractors, and feasibility studies for various weapon programs. Further, since his departure from LANL, Mr. Armenis has worked as a consultant for his former employer in this technical area. His efforts included reviews of NTS test device records to determine document retention issues and the research of weapon development records. This research has resulted in written histories of the development of various stockpile weapons. Therefore, Mr. Armenis's unparalleled blend of hands-on expertise in the development of assembly and disassembly procedures of nuclear weapons, coupled with his more recent work in research and recreation of these activities, makes him uniquely qualified to assist the Board in its health and safety reviews of current DOE weapons disassembly efforts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board also examined Mr. Armenis's current financial relationship with LANL, which includes a vested pension program and approximately twelve weeks a year of the consulting work described above, and considered the potential effect it may have on his objectivity in performing the Board's work. Based on this review, the Board determined that these relationships should not interfere with his work for the Board since the pension, and any future increases, is calculated according to fixed formulas and prior contributions, and the relative value of his LANL consulting effort is low compared to the number of hours actually worked by Mr. Armenis each year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, the continued use of Mr. Armenis by the Board is consistent with the spirit and intent of Board Recommendation 93&hyph;6 to the Secretary of Energy dated December 10, 1993. This recommendation highlights the need for DOE to retain access to capability and capture the unique knowledge of individuals who have been engaged for many years in certain critical defense nuclear activities in order to avoid future safety problems in these and related areas. The Board's concern is that while documentation essential to DOE's current weapons dismantlement program exists on the design and safety aspects of nuclear weapons, it is also important, for safety reasons, to involve individuals from the design laboratories of LANL, LLNL, and Sandia. These individuals should participate in reviews of detailed dismantlement procedures and specialized procedures and should respond to problems encountered in the course of weapon dismantlement. The design individuals from the laboratories most needed in connection with dismantlement of a specific weapon are those who had been active in the original design of that weapon.These individuals are believed to possess information not recorded in documentation, such as reasons for specific design features and personal knowledge of any problems that have arisen during design, fabrication, and stockpile life. Therefore, while the Board believes that DOE must retain and utilize certain expertise in the weapons area, it also recognizes the value of acquiring specialized technical support from Mr. Armenis in the fulfillment of its health and safety responsibilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board also recognized that it is unlikely that the work being performed by Mr. Armenis could be satisfactorily performed by anyone else whose experience and affiliations would not give rise to a conflict of interest question. That is because the individuals who have the requisite expertise in this area could only have obtained such expertise through previous or current employment or consulting relationship with one or more of the weapons design laboratories. The pertinent experience of other qualified individuals would therefore likely raise similar conflicting questions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, as the Board is required under its OCI Regulations, where reasonably possible, to initiate measures which attempt to mitigate an OCI, Mr. Armenis and the Board agreed to the following during contract performance. Should the effort Mr. Armenis is currently performing for LANL change from only providing assistance in the historical recreation of past weapons activities to one of assessing the adequacy or safety of current weapons disassembly procedures or some other task which would directly conflict with work he performs for the Board, he will immediately notify the Board, which then will take further action as appropriate. Also, the efforts of Mr. Armenis will be overseen by experienced technical staff of the Board who are able to ensure that all of his resultant work products are impartial and contain full support for any findings and recommendations issued thereunder. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, on the basis of the determination described above and pursuant to the applicable provisions of 10 CFR part 1706, the Chairman of the Board granted a waiver of any conflicts of interests (and the pertinent provisions of the OCI Regulations) with the Board's contract with Mr. Nicholas P. Armenis that might arise out of his existing relationship with LANL. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: July 18, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Joe Neubeiser, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Acting General Manager. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;17807 Filed 7&hyph;21&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 6802&hyph;KD&hyph;M <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

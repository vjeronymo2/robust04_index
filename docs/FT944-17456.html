			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Swedish premier calls in executives Mr Ingvar Carlsson, Sweden's new Social Democratic prime minister, yesterday called in a group of the country's top business leaders to advise him on industrial policy, including three executives who launched a thinly-veiled attack on Social Democratic policies during the general election campaign. Mr Carlsson, who officially assumed office yesterday, outlined in his opening speech to the Riksdag (parliament) his government's policy platform and said that he was appointing a special industry advisory committee to support him in his efforts to reduce unemployment, running at around 14 per cent of the workforce. The committee is to include Mr Percy Barnevik, chief executive of the Swiss-Swedish engineering group Asea Brown Boveri, Mr Lars Ramqvist, chief executive of the telecommunications group Ericsson, Mr Bo Berggren, chairman of the forestry group Stora, Mr Leif Johansson, chief executive of Electrolux, and Mr Bert-Olof Svanholm, head of the Swedish division of ABB and chairman of Volvo. All five, who will be joined by other senior Swedish business leaders, are key figures in the Wallenberg family industrial empire. Mr Ramqvist, Mr Berggren and Mr Svanholm were co-signatories of a newspaper article shortly before last month's general election which warned of the threat to investment in Sweden if the new government introduced policies harmful to industry. They most strongly opposed income tax increases which Social Democrats are committed to. Mr Carlsson, saying his top priority was to tackle the budget deficit and reduce unemployment, said new jobs must come from industry. 'Sweden needs more companies and more company owners,' he said. 'This requires closer co-operation between the government and industry. I will personally be strongly engaged in this work.' The Social Democrats plan to increase investment incentives and may try to cut corporate tax. But the new prime minister gave no indication that he would back down on his election programme of raising marginal income taxes, wealth and capital taxes and taxes on dividends. Mr Carlsson said the election plan, which also included spending cuts, and measures already approved by parliament this year would over the next four years strengthen the budget by SKr80bn. Apart from the public finances and unemployment his four other priorities were to protect and develop the welfare state, increase Sweden's international engagement, deepen co-operation in Europe and harmonise the environment and industry.</p>

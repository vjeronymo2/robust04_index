			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Man in the News: Full of beans and blarney - Tony O'Reilly It is long after midnight in a leafy Pittsburgh suburb, and Tony O'Reilly is saying effusive goodnights. The Dublin-born chairman of H J Heinz, the US food group, will have a few hours' sleep, and then jet to Washington DC. There, he will defend the group's Weight Watchers division before the Federal Trade Commission, which is looking into weight loss claims. Next day, it will be on to New York for his eldest son's wedding. After that, there are his newspapers in Ireland and Australia to attend to, not to mention share stakes in Waterford Wedgwood and Fitzwilton, the Irish mini-conglomerate. At some stage, he will return to a 500-acre estate in County Kildare, where horse-breeding interests beckon. But for the past five hours, no one would have guessed this was a businessman in a hurry. O'Reilly has commanded a dinner-table with an outpouring of indiscreet anecdotes and Irish verbosity. Subjects have ranged from the tunnel vision of bankers to the merits of inflation. 'Maynard Keynes and Jesus Christ,' he proclaims, 'were the two greatest men in the past 2,000 years.' His second wife - Chryss Goulandris, a Greek-American shipping heiress - quietly leaves the room, and returns with emerald green badges designed by her husband to show to their guests. 'The Deficit Doesn't Matter,' they declare. Such is the life of Ireland's best-known executive export. The expansive bon viveur, who started out as a rugby international and once auditioned for Ben-Hur, juggles an exhausting array of private and public interests. This has fascinated commentators for years. Can anyone successfully manage so many competing demands, ask the sceptics. Or is everyone being fooled by charming Irish blarney and shrewd self-promotion? These questions have become more intense as the performance of Heinz has stalled. This week, it said it would take a Dollars 192m charge to cover cost-cutting. This resulted in a slide in operating profits, for the second year running, to Dollars 860m, below the level of four years ago. There has been speculation in the industry that O'Reilly, 57, has been focusing on short term management goals, and that he might now be ready to bail out of Heinz, after more than 20 years with the group. O'Reilly entered the foods business early in his working life. The son of an Irish customs officer, he studied law at University College, Dublin, but he soon switched to business. At 26, he became head of the Milk Marketing Board of Ireland, where he was credited with launching and promoting Kerrygold butter, the successful export brand. O'Reilly moved on to manage a couple of Irish food companies which did business with Heinz. The US company got to know him and, to the surprise of many, tapped the 32-year-old Irishman to head its UK business. Two years later, he was sitting in the Pittsburgh head office. He was named Heinz president in 1973 and became chief executive six years later. In the early days, Heinz grew commendably. In the 1980s, earnings per share virtually quadrupled. This was mainly because of vigorous pressure on costs, international expansion and the success of its Weight Watchers business. However, since 1990, the company has faced intense competition in many main markets and profits growth has been an uphill battle. At such times, some in the business wonder whether O'Reilly is spreading himself too thinly. He has more than Dollars 150m tied up in other businesses, mainly in Ireland. Only this week, it was announced that he would become non-executive chairman of Waterford Wedgwood, the prestigious but troubled ceramics and glasswear manufacturer, at the end of the year. His investments, have not always performed smoothly. Most notorious is Atlantic Resources, an oil exploration company founded in 1981 and headed by O'Reilly. It was sold last year to Conroy Petroleum at 2p a share, from a peak of IPounds 5.50, having never made a profit. O'Reilly denies that his life outside Heinz is a distraction. Eighty per cent of his time, he says, is devoted to the US company. 'I have a huge economic incentive,' he says, pointing to an option deal struck in 1990 allowing him to buy 4m Heinz shares at just under Dollars 30 apiece in 1995. With the share price at Dollars 37, there is a current paper profit of Dollars 28m. This might satisfy many people. But O'Reilly, who already owns another 3m-plus shares, says not. 'Every Dollars 10 movement in the share price is Dollars 72m. So you can hardly think of any better way to spend your time, if you're being ruthlessly economic about it, than working for Heinz.' And money, he says, is only half the story. 'I have an enormous personal commitment. Heinz was worth Dollars 900m when I took over in July 1979, and now it's got a market capitalisation of Dollars 10bn. So I think I would like to see this growth path resume. I think there is a disaffection which the investment community has not just with food stocks, but with disinflation. Usually you can get your growth out of price, volume and costs. In these times, with a shell-shocked consumer, it's only possible to get it out of volume and costs.' He points out that Heinz has been facing price wars in about five main business areas, from pet food to ketchup. In the 1980s, by contrast, it largely avoided such skirmishes. But isn't juggling the portfolio of brands, and pinpointing growth sectors, supposed to be the art of consumer products management? After all, this is what O'Reilly did when he picked up Weight Watchers for Dollars 71m in 1978. 'Well, critics can always say that,' he retorts, launching into a long defence of Heinz's particular interests. 'But I feel mostly stimulated by this present environment. I think the Heinz company has done a hell of a lot of sensible things. But the task is not complete, and I see myself at Heinz for at least another three years.' Is running Heinz what gives him most pleasure? Mr O'Reilly pauses and chuckles, but declines to go quite so far. 'There's a certain amount of native pride,' he says, the Irish brogue thickening a little. 'It's where my professional reputation rests.'</p>

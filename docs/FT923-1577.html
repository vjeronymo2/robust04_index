			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Money Markets: Cash rates softer RATES IN the sterling cash market softened considerably yesterday, as dealers wondered whether the Bundesbank's support of the French franc in the European exchange rate mechanism might force the German central bank to cut short-term interest rates. With the UK out of the ERM, the result of the French referendum on the Maastricht treaty had little impact on the sterling money market. Indeed, one dealer commented yesterday that a No vote might have made the market more bullish about the prospect of a UK base rate cut. That result would have split the ERM apart, and other central banks could have reduced lending rates. Although sterling is floating freely, the UK authorities have not yet outlined what their policy on the currency is. The market's assumption is that base rates will soon be lowered by at least  1/2 percentage point, and 3-month money ended yesterday at 9 7/16 per cent on the offered side, after a Friday close of 10 1/2 per cent. One factor which might allow the UK to cut rates with impunity would be a fall in the Bundesbank's Lombard rate. This is still deemed unlikely in the near term, and yesterday the Bundesbank cancelled this week's tender for securities and repurchase funds, effectively draining DM20bn from the market. This move helped to sterilise the massive intervention by the Bundesbank on the foreign exchanges recently to support the lira and dollar. However, overt support for the French franc from Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, suggests that the Germans do not want to see the EMS fall apart. Given the continuing pressures on the ERM, some dealers suspected yesterday that the Bundesbank could be forced to cut rates to prop up the remaining currencies. The Bank of England was quick to confirm that there would be no interest rate cut yesterday. After forecasting an Pounds 800m shortage, the Bank calmed the market by buying Pounds 200m in a repurchase agreement (repo) at 9 15/16 per cent at the established rate of 9 15/16 per cent. The Bank then purchased Pounds 126m of Band 1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent and Pounds 200m in a repo. The forecast was revised to Pounds 950m and the Bank bought Pounds 116m of Band 1 bank bills and provided Pounds 330m late assistance.</p>

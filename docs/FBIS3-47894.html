The department  should not be engaged in other activity, except the mentioned  functions, says D. Sandag.

Of activity of the previous state security organs,  D. Sandag considers as necessary promotion of young people, the  raising of their qualification.    Answering questions of the correspondent, D. Sandag stresses  that those working at state security organs as military  servicemen should observe a strict discipline, abstain from  belonging to any party, as it is envisaged by the law. In this  sense, he says, forces in opposition should not exist in state  security organs.    Concerning the statement by Colonel L. Sanjaasuren on  intentions to liquidate the materials about abuse of power and  bribery by some high officials, which are kept in the State  Security Department, D. Sandag notes that, in his view, such  serious violations do not exist, and that the accusations  brought might be based on a striving for winning authority, by  using the differences of political forces. D. Sandag notes that  the issues, which were touched upon by Colonel L. Sanjaasuren,  are being now checked up by a special commission of the  parliament and the public will be get acquainted with results in  its time [sentence as received]. In D. Sandag's view, the  recent changes of the leadership of the State Security Central  Department have been connected with shortcomings in their  activity.</p>

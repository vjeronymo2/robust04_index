			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: COMPTON;  </P> <P> COUNCIL PULLS THE PLUG ON FILMING PUBLIC COMMENTS  </P> <P> For the first time in its six-year history, Compton turned off its cable  television cameras Tuesday when it came time during the regular weekly City  Council meeting to hear comments from members of the audience and individual  council members.  </P> <P> Just moments before it pulled the plug, the council reaffirmed the 4-1 vote it  cast last week when Councilwoman Bernice Woods introduced a motion to limit the  broadcasts. Woods and other council members who supported her motion complained  that too many people use the council television broadcasts to promote  themselves and further their political ambitions.  </P> <P> From now on, the live broadcasts will include only that portion of the council  meeting that deals with items that have been put on the agenda in advance for  action.  </P> <P> Some residents, as well as Councilwoman Patricia Moore, who voted against  pulling the plug, charged that the council's action is tantamount to censorship  because audience comments often contain criticism of city officials and council  policy.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> RAMS ACTIVATE GREENE, STEWART AND REED FOR SUNDAY'S GAME  </P> <P> The Rams announced today that they have activated linebacker Kevin Greene,  defensive tackle Doug Reed and safety Michael Stewart for Sunday's game at  Green Bay against the Packers.  </P> <P> The three players signed contracts with the Rams last weekend. Because they  signed so late, the Rams received a two-week roster exemption from the NFL for  them, but have decided not to use it.  </P> <P> To make room for the trio on their roster, the Rams placed rookie wide receiver  Tony Lomack and running back Jim Price on injured reserve. Both have hamstring  injuries.  </P> <P> The Rams had an open spot on their roster before making transactions, meaning  they had to move only two players to make way for Greene, Reed and Stewart.  </P></p>

			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Madrid confronts unions head on The Spanish government is determined to confront the unions and deregulate the labour market despite the threat of a general strike next month and foreign investor nervousness about growing industrial unrest, a senior minister said yesterday. Mr Pedro Solbes, economy and finance minister, insisted at a conference in Madrid organised by the Financial Times and Expansion newspaper that the strike would have 'no impact on what the government intends to do' and that it would 'in no way affect the exchange rate'. Unions have called for a 24-hour walkout in the second half of January to force the government to withdraw legislation aimed at loosening fixed employment guidelines and making it easier to sack staff. The government, which argues that Spain's labour market rigidities are directly responsible its unemployment levels - the highest in the European Union - is to approve the deregulation measures tomorrow Mr Solbes said the cabinet would approve a decree law, with immediate effect that would end the government's monopoly on job placements for the unemployed and remove legal impediments to apprenticeship schemes and part-time employment. The government hopes as many as 900,000 18-25-year-olds will be able to enter the job market under these measures. The jobless figure stands at 3.5m or 23 per cent of the labour force, according to the national statistics office. The peseta, which has been under heavy selling pressure, remains the weakest currency in the European monetary system's exchange rate mechanism although it held steady yesterday at Pta82.18 to the D-Mark. It gained slightly against the dollar closing at Pta140.95. The government-union showdown in Spain comes at the end of a fruitless three-month attempt to negotiate a 'social pact' with unions and employers on wage restraint and labour market reform. The talks were called off officially on Tuesday. The measures are opposed by the unions who accuse the government of creating 'junk jobs'. Organised labour is even more hostile to a draft law, also to be unveiled tomorrow, which will alter statutory labour rules on a maximum eight-hour working day and a daily 12-hour minimum rest period, change collective bargaining procedures, streamline job classifications and ease relocations.</p>

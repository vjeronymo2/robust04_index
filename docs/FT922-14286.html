			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Portugal cuts rates as it enters ERM PORTUGAL yesterday cut its two key interest rates and sold escudos on currency markets to ensure that the Portuguese unit did not hit its ceiling in its first day of trading on the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM). The move by the Bank of Portugal, aimed at reducing the attraction of escudos for foreign investors, also helped to lift pressure on sterling in the tense period before the UK general election on Thursday. The escudo is heavily in demand from investors because of Portugal's high interest rates. Yesterday, sterling gained a quarter of a pfennig against a slightly stronger D-Mark, closing in London at DM2.8375. At this level it is more than 5 pfennigs above its ERM floor of about DM2.78. Last week the pound, the system's weakest member, came under pressure amid nervousness about a possible change of UK government. The Bank of Portugal reduced its top intervention rate at which it injects liquidity into the money market by 1 percentage point, to 17.9375 per cent. As well as selling escudos for pounds and D-Marks, the bank shaved to 15.375 per cent the rate at which it drains cash from the market, a drop of a quarter of a percentage point. These actions had their desired effect of pushing the escudo to a close of 85.86 against the D-Mark. This was higher than the central ERM rate of 86.94, but lower than the rate earlier in the day when the escudo had been pushed to 85.57 against the German unit. The escudo, like the pound and the Spanish peseta, trades in a wide, 6 per cent ERM band. Even though the Portuguese unit is generally thinly traded, an increase in value to near its upper limit could jeopardise sterling's position. Portugal's interest rate cuts - and the expectation of further reductions - will go some way towards meeting criticisms from Portuguese industry that growth prospects are being hit by high borrowing costs. The cuts are likely to be considered by some as insufficient to compensate for the loss of competitiveness from the escudo's high value. Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, the prime minister, said future interest rate movements would depend on the market, adding that they were likely to fall 'some percentage points in the course of the year'. The escudo's ERM entry, agreed at the weekend, means all the European Community currencies, except the Greek drachma, participate in the system. Mr Luis Nogueira, an analyst at Finantia, the merchant bank, said: 'Until now, bringing down inflation was a goal. Now there is no question that it has to be brought under control. Interest rates are also likely to fall faster than expected.' The escudo joins the FT's table of EMS currencies from today. The table, published daily, includes ecu central rates, each currency's spread against the weakest currency, and EMS divergence indicators. Editorial Comment, Page 18 Currencies, Page 31</p>

			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / World Trade News: US plans an early exit from Gatt The US plans to withdraw from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade with effect from early next year, provided the US Congress ratifies the global trade accords setting up the World Trade Organisation, Gatt's successor. The WTO is due to come into effect on January 1. Although the US maintains the move will have little practical impact, the decision has caused considerable concern among trading partners who say it will allow the US to escape Gatt obligations to countries which are not WTO members from the start. In addition, outstanding trade disputes under Gatt - including such controversial cases as the tuna-dolphin row and punitive US duties on steel imports - will simply lapse. The US Senate is to vote on the Uruguay Round trade pact on December 2, three days after the House of Representatives. The Clinton administration can then withdraw from Gatt after a 60-day notice period. The US had hoped to time its pull-out from Gatt to coincide with the WTO's entry into force but this proved impolitic after Congress delayed the ratification vote from October to December. Washington says it decided as long ago as 1991 that it would not remain a member of both Gatt and the WTO, which would involve overlapping legal obligations to different groups of countries. However, no other country has indicated its intention to follow suit. US officials denied yesterday that Washington was in some sense dodging its fair trade responsibilities. Mr Andrew Stoler, deputy US ambassador to Gatt, said the US had no intention of removing existing Gatt trade benefits from countries which were not WTO members, though the legal underpinning provided by Gatt would go. The US would also stand by obligations arising from dispute panel reports already adopted by Gatt. But unresolved disputes and those still under investigation at the time of withdrawal would fall by the wayside. Mr Stoler added that only Switzerland among important trading nations had said it could not meet the January 1 WTO deadline. However, of Gatt's 124 members, only about 40 nations, in addition to the 30 that have already ratified, have notified Gatt they are in a position to complete legal formalities by the end of the year. Switzerland apart, most of the others are small developing countries. These nations, Mr Stoler argues, are not countries with which the US is likely to be in dispute. During the Uruguay Round negotiations, it was agreed that Gatt would continue in parallel with the WTO for an undefined period, since several countries would not be able to join the WTO straight away. However, precisely how the two legal agreements will operate in tandem has not been clarified. To minimise the potential for inconsistency (and give laggards a strong incentive to join the WTO), there is broad support for a two-year 'cut-off' after which Gatt would cease to exist.</p>

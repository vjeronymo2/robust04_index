			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FRENCH SCIENTOLOGY PRESIDENT, 5 OTHERS ARRESTED  </P> <P> The president of the French branch of the Church of Scientology and five  colleagues have been arrested in a probe of alleged fraud and illegal practice  of medicine, court and church officials said Saturday.  </P> <P> The president, Daniele Gounord, was arrested Friday in Paris along with the  church's treasurer and the head of a church foundation.  </P> <P> They were placed under court supervision, but not jailed  </P> <P> Three officials of the Scientologists' branch in Lyon were arrested there in  the last 10 days -- the local president, treasurer and secretary. They have  been charged with complicity in fraud and illegal practice of medicine.  </P> <P> All six are to appear in court in Lyon, where an order for Friday's arrests was  issued by Judge Georges Fenech.  </P> <P> The arrests stem from a police investigation into the suicide of Patrick Vick,  a Church of Scientology member in Lyon who jumped out of a 12th-floor window in  1988. Investigators found medicine in his house allegedly provided to him by  the church in violation of a regulation requiring a doctor's prescription.  </P> <P> Vick's widow filed a complaint in court against the Scientologists' branch in  Lyon.  </P></p>

			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Letter: Devilish task to negotiate pensions maze Sir, John Plender must have missed the sweetener in his morning coffee before he wrote 'Sinking funds' (January 14). His indictment of the 'gaggle of actuaries, lawyers, bankers and consultants' as a 'dismal, self-serving lobby' is overdone. While I am not a member of this dismal gaggle, I have dealt with it on both sides of the Atlantic for more than 20 years. I think Mr Plender's Scud was fired in the wrong direction so here is a Patriot in response. Pension legislation is obviously needed and the professional organisations in the UK, including the National Association of Pension Funds, are providing sound advice to the lawmakers. Achieving the right degree of regulation over this complex and sensitive maze of conflicting interests will be a devilish task. The US Congress passed its landmark pension legislation in 1974 and America's pension funds (and its own gaggle of experts) have spent the past 17 years working out the snags. At the end of the day, the basic issue is simple: How effectively to insure fiduciary responsibility. Those who deal with the assets of a pension scheme are held to a standard requiring above all else loyalty to the beneficiaries. In this context 'loyalty' means the trustees must deal solely in the interest of the plan members and never benefit themselves from the use of plan assets. Fraud can no more be eliminated in the pension system than it can in the rest of the financial world. It can only be made more difficult to bring off. The UK pension community is well-served by its professional advisers and exerts as they tackle the problem of protecting plan members while avoiding smothering pension trustees under a bureaucratic blanket of regulations.

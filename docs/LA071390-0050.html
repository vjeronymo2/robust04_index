			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'MY UNCLE'S LEGACY' LOOKS AT THE EVIL EXCESSES OF COMMUNISM  </P> <P> Krsto Papic's "My Uncle's Legacy" (at the Monica 4-Plex) has reportedly been  simultaneously the most controversial and the most successful Yugoslavian film  ever made. It's easy to see why on both counts: it unflinchingly confronts the  evils of the Communist Party in the 1950s, wielding its power exultantly in the  wake of Tito's triumphant break with Stalin. However, what Papic depicts in his  and Ivan Aralica's adaptation of Aralica's novel "Framework of Hatred" couldn't  seem more Stalinist in its rigidity and paranoia.  </P> <P> The time is 1987. The camera picks up an elderly man in a bathrobe and pajamas  shuffling across a stately Zagreb square. He makes his way to the book-strewn  apartment of his nephew, a prominent middle-aged writer, and asks for a glass  of water. What he is really asking for is forgiveness of the younger man, whom  he has not seen in 36 years. He also asks that a priest officiate at his  funeral, a scandalous request for a man who has been a top party official.  </P> <P> We then flash back to 1951, to a rural community a mere four miles from the  Italian border. The uncle (Miodrag Krivokapic) is already a party leader,  coping on the one hand with a father (Fabijan Sovagovic) who resists the  collectivization of the family farm and, on the other, with his nephew Martin  (Davor Janjic), an outspoken independent thinker and talented caricaturist who  is a student at a small teachers' college.  </P> <P> Although Yugoslavia's preeminent younger director Emir Kusturica has called  Papic's film "brilliant," do not expect the passion and vitality that mark  Kusturica's films, especially his Oscar-nominated "When Father Was Away on  Business," which is set in the late '40s as Tito was still struggling to  establish his independence from Stalin. Both directors skewer Communist Party  excesses, but in Kusturica's film there is a broader perspective, a greater  willingness to forgive. Although there is some warmth, humor and even a little  sex in "My Uncle's Legacy," it is fundamentally a somber, angry, implacable  indictment and settling of scores, and understandably so: born in 1933, Papic,  a distinguished veteran filmmaker, is the same age as Martin. (Kusturica was  born in 1955.)  </P> <P> Education at the teachers' college is basically a business of heavyhanded  communist indoctrination from a principal and faculty dedicated to ferreting  out and punishing the slightest deviation from the party line. It is a place  where Martin, who is involved in a budding romance with the beautiful Martha  (Alma Prica), is inevitably headed for trouble. It's no matter that he actually  tries to subscribe to the teachings of his uncle, who has raised him; he's so  questioning that he's vulnerable to being charged with anti-revolutionary acts  he has not in fact committed.  </P> <P> Only 17 when the film was shot, Davor Janjic gives a remarkably adult  performance, intense and concentrated, and his fellow actors are on a par with  him. "My Uncle's Legacy" (Times-rated Mature) is impressive but bleak, evoking  tragedy and loss more than forgiveness and reconciliation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'MY UNCLE'S LEGACY'  </P> <P> An International Film Exchange release of a co-production of Uraniafilm  (Zagreb) and Stassen Productions (Los Angeles).

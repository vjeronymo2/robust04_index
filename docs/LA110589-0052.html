			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FREQUENTLY ACCURATE  </P> <P> As an active real estate appraiser in Southern California, I read with interest  Dan Thomas Nelson's article, "How Appraisers Value a Home" (Oct. 22).  </P> <P> Generally, the article was consistent with the appraisal profession. However, I  take exception to two items. First, Mr. Nelson stated that the county  assessor's living area for homes is "frequently wrong." In my 12 years'  experience as an appraiser, I have found the assessor's living area is  frequently accurate.  </P> <P> Usually, a substantial disparity is the result of a non-permitted (therefore  illegal) room addition. (An illegal room addition can quite possibly contribute  very little to the value of a home, especially if the addition does not meet  the local building code.)  </P> <P> Secondly, the appraiser implied that a hillside lot is generally worth less  than a level lot of similar size. In today's view-conscious society, a hillside  lot with a view, especially of the ocean, can be more valuable than an entirely  level lot. In addition, a hillside lot provides considerable privacy.  </P> <P> KEVIN HOLLINGSWORTH  </P> <P> San Dimas  </P></p>

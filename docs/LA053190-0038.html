			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOOD COALITION FALLS ON HARD TIMES AGAIN;  </P> <P> HOMELESS: A PROGRAM TO FEED THE NEEDY THAT WAS OUSTED FROM WEST HOLLYWOOD IS  NOW DRAWING POLICE AND HEALTH CITATIONS IN HOLLYWOOD.  </P> <P> The Greater West Hollywood Food Coalition, which two months ago was ousted from  West Hollywood's Plummer Park, is again fighting for its survival.  </P> <P> The nightly feeding program for the homeless moved across the city border to  Hollywood in order to continue its operation, but there too it has run into  difficulties.  </P> <P> In recent weeks, the group has been issued citations from the police and  threatened with closure by the county Department of Health Services for  operating without a permit after both agencies received complaints about the  program from a movie supply company. The program operates in front of the  company's building at Sycamore Avenue and Romaine Street.  </P> <P> "It's the same thing all over again," said Ted Landreth, a spokesman for the  coalition. "What we are faced with is an underlying hypocrisy. People pretend  that they care about the have-nots when all they really care about is  protecting their own material well-being."  </P> <P> The coalition moved the program to the intersection of Sycamore and Romaine in  March after it was ordered out of Plummer Park by the West Hollywood City  Council following neighborhood complaints that the feeding program was causing  sanitation problems and attracting criminals.  </P> <P> The new site was selected because it is in an industrial area away from homes  and is only a mile from the park where it had operated for two years. The group  bought a truck with donated funds, began using the kitchen at nearby Bethel  Lutheran Church and resumed its nightly feeding operation.  </P> <P> Within a few weeks, the program was operating at full strength, feeding roughly  150 people a night with food brought in by truck and distributed to the  homeless who would eat in a parking lot on the corner.  </P> <P> "Everything was going well; our numbers were back up, and then suddenly all  hell broke loose," said Maggie Preston Brammall, a coalition volunteer.  </P> <P> The same complaints that the group received from residents in West Hollywood  began to haunt the program at the new location.  </P> <P> Mole-Richardson Co., a movie supply company that owns the building and parking  lot on the intersection of Romaine and Sycamore, complained to the police that  the program was causing litter and attracting undesirables.  </P> <P> Police began making visits to the feeding line, warning operators that there  had been complaints about the program. And May 16, six police officers and a  county health inspector showed up at the site. The group was issued two  citations, one for parking in a red zone, another for distributing food within  100 feet of an intersection.  </P> <P> "The police told us they would continue to harass us until we moved," Brammall  said. "They told us they knew plenty of laws they could use against us."  </P> <P> Capt. Rick Dinse of the Hollywood Division denied that his officers were  harassing the program. He said the citations were issued after several  warnings.  </P> <P> In addition, he said, police have "received numerous complaints from a  businessman in the area that the program is drawing transients into the  community who are loitering around, intimidating clients, and urinating and  defecating on his property."  </P> <P> A Mole-Richardson spokesman would not comment on the matter other than to say  that the company is trying to work out a solution with the feeding program.  </P> <P> Dinse met with representatives from Mole-Richardson and the coalition in his  office May 18. Dinse said he told coalition members that they could continue  distributing food near the intersection as long as the feeding operation is  restricted to the public sidewalk and the group does not break any laws, such  as littering and trespassing on private property.  </P> <P> "Even though they may not be considered a good neighbor, they may continue to  operate there as long as they don't break any laws," he said, adding that his  officers will continue to monitor the group's operation.  </P> <P> In response to the complaints, coalition volunteers have stepped up efforts to  make sure that the area is cleaned and that their clients do not loiter in the  neighborhood after the meals are served.  </P> <P> Coalition members have also been under the scrutiny of the county Department of  Health Services, which has said the program is operating without a permit.  </P> <P> Health officials inspected the group's kitchen and its food truck and listed  three pages of violations that must be addressed before a permit is issued.  Most of the problems were considered minor, but some of the more expensive  items included removing the linoleum floors and replacing refrigerators with  professional models.  </P> <P> LeTaun J. Cole-Burke, chief environmental health specialist for the county,  said the county is not trying to put the group out of business.  </P> <P> "Our goal is not to put anyone out of business," she said. "We are working with  them to help them improve their operation so there is less likelihood that the  food will be contaminated. We don't want the homeless to become sick either.  Let's take some preventive measures."  </P> <P> The permit requirement by health officials caught coalition members off guard  because they had operated the volunteer program in West Hollywood without a  permit.  </P> <P> Because many of the requirements would place a financial burden on the group,  coalition members have asked the county to relax some of the requirements.  </P> <P> "If they start pressing us on concrete floors and professional refrigerators,  we are out of business," Brammall said. "We couldn't possibly create a concrete  floor in a church we don't own."  </P> <P> She said the group is short of money since West Hollywood cut off its funding  and evicted it from Plummer Park. It has also had to scramble to find adequate  donors to cover its food distribution. It lost a major food donor when Drexel  Burnham Lambert declared bankruptcy. In many ways, she said, the coalition is  like the people it serves.  </P> <P> "We are desperately short of money. It is almost laughable how little money we  have to operate," she said. "Every day is a struggle. The problem is that a lot  of people think we don't have a homeless problem, that the homeless are people  who are lazy and don't want to work. Then there are those who care, but they  just don't want to look at the people in our line."  </P></p>

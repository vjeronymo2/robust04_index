Next to the burned out  comets Lothar de Maiziere, Guenther Krause, and Rainer Ortleb,  she remained the fixed star in politics: Angela Merkel (39),  federal minister for women and youth, the last in the group of  the first hour from the east.    In the theater of Bonn, Angela Merkel does not dance for the  grandstands. She stands so conspicuously inconspicuously in the  first row as though applause is rather painful to her. She has  laboriously shed her cocoon without turning into a butterfly.  She emits a gentle radiance, whereas others try to light up the  sky with the brilliance of their ideas.    The adjectives for her work range from "inconspicuous" to  "persistent" and "unerring" and those for her person extend from  "sensitive" and "vulnerable" to "courageous." The truth is that  all of them fit.    In her three years in the west, the woman from the east has  learned to swim in the tank with the sharks: "There are many  here who are not as invulnerable as they appear to be." She has  developed her sense for the political depths to the point where  she can also perceive diffuse signals of power in time. Angela  Merket has no desire to "acclimate herself through opportunism";  she prefers to "dress more warmly" against political cold waves.  She uses self-irony to protect herself against being ground down  in Bonn.    "The girl," as Helmut Kohl calls his minister, is the eldest  of three children of a Hamburg pastor and a teacher. When Angela  Dorothea Kasner was still in diapers, her father took over the  pastorate in Quitzow near Templin. The family moved to the March  of Brandenburg.    The girl knew the names of all the members of the GDR  Politburo. But she could also recite "the entire cabinet of  Konrad Adenauer and experienced the election of Gustav Heinemann  as federal president through the radio in the school lavatory."    Angela Kasner majored in physics and graduated from the  University of Leipzig in 1978, and received a doctorate in 1986  with a dissertation on "The Calculation of the Velocity  Constants of Elementary Reactions With the Example of Simple  Carbohydrates." She learned how to tie the knot of the blue  neckerchief of the Young Pioneers and perceived herself "as part  of the GDR state and simultaneously lived in permanent rebellion  against the system." Her motto at the time was this: "Anyone who  does not do mischief, becomes stupid." In 1979, she married the  physicist Ulrich Merkel. The childless marriage failed.    In 1989, as the GDR neared its end, Angela Merkel got  involved as a publicity worker with the "Democratic Awakening"  of Wolfgang Schnur and as assistant spokesperson of the last GDR  Government under Lothar de Maiziere. In August 1990, she found a  brief political home with the eastern CDU [Christian Democratic  Union].    After unification, she became a member of the first  all-Germany Bundestag in Bonn through a direct candidacy in the  Stralsund/Ruegen/Grimmen election district, receiving 48.5  percent of the first votes. On 18 January 1991, Federal  Chancellor Helmut Kohl entrusted her with the new Ministry for  Women and Youth.    The rise of Angela Merkel in the CDU is likewise one of the  most abrupt political careers in postwar Germany: she became  deputy chairman of the federal party after Lothar de Maziere  resigned in December 1991, and she became chairman of the land  Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania for the CDU after Guenther Krause  resigned in June 1993.    The manager of the ministry -- 250 employees and an annual  budget of 2.5 million marks -- hurries from nest to nest:  "Unfortunately there is no time left for a real home": her  political berths are on the Rhine and the Baltic Sea; her  infrequent private resting place is Berlin, where her life  companion lives.    Angela Merkel fights against the cliche of the chancellor's  submissive foster daughter: "I admire Helmut Kohl, but that is  not a relationship of submission." She allows herself to be used  as a party soldier, "but I am not an accommodating woman." She  proved that with a number of original initiatives:     -  In the  fight about the rewording of the abortion Paragraph 218, she did  loyally join the majority in the Union against the term solution  but she set an accent of her own with the motto "help instead of  punishment."    -  She presented the draft of a law on equality of  rights, under which firms are supposed to prove that in their  hiring they do not prefer male over female applicants, and she  suffered the strong opposition of her parliamentary group.    -  She  started the national action "No Violence Against Children" to  curb the criminality with the largest number of unknown  cases.    -  She engaged in frank discussion with radical rightist and  leftist young people.    -  She called for "ethnology" as a compulsory  subject in the schools because of the continuing violence  against foreigners.    -  She called on the television establishments  to limit sex and violence on the viewing screens.    -  She favored a  general legal right to kindergarten spots.    The 60-kg woman is the talent that the CDU would like to use  in the German east in the super election year. General Secretary  Peter Hintze praises: "She is a credible representative of the  democratic movement in the former GDR and a convincing performer  in the Federal Government."    The last person in the first batch loves the soft tones of  her favorite composer Mozart, because: "The one who shouts is  usually wrong." She is not invulnerable: "If they hit me in the  right place, they can really hurt me."    By now she can do that too. She thinks: "The discussion  about  the Stasi files should not be taboo"; there ought to be "no  pause in the Stasi files because it happens to be election  time." That is aimed above all at Brandenburg's  Minister-President Manfred Stolpe (SPD) [Social Democratic Party  of Germany], whom she sees as an "obstacle in dealing with the  past of the GDR." Stolpe, she demands categorically, "must  resign"; he has let himself "into a game with the devil that has  led him into extreme situations."    The CDU woman with the bobbed hair looks at the framed  portrait of Konrad Adenauer. It is the only picture in her new  office on Rochusstrasse in Bonn. She then mounts a frontal  attack against her opponent, just as the old man from Rhoendorf  once did: "I was seldom as angry in the GDR as I was with the  passage of the SPD-SED [Socialist Unity Party of Germany] paper.  All of us there considered Hermann Axen and the others to be  idiots and social democrats around Egon Bahr got involved with  them and appealed to the same intellectual roots."    The dismantling of Saxon Minister of Justice Steffen  Heitmann, who should have been federal president if it had been  up to the chancellor and in accordance with her wishes, "really  embittered her" and "was a disappointing experience on the way  to German unification." Many in the west, she thinks, "obviously  cannot imagine that someone from the east might do something  right." The candidate from the east was asked the "sort of  elementary questions that would not be allowed for a west German  candidate--neither for Mr. Rau nor for Mr. Herzog."</p>

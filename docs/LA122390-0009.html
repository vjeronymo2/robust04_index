			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JACK SMITH ON SUNDAY: SPEAKING VOLUMES;  </P> <P> BIG BOOKS LAND ON COFFEE TABLES, WHERE THEY'RE HARDLY EVER READ  </P> <P> ONE THING I DON'T WANT for Christmas is a coffee-table book.  </P> <P> They are called coffee-table books, I suppose, because they are too big to go  anyplace else, and they are expensive, lavishly illustrated books that are  designed to catch the eye of the casual guest.  </P> <P> In most of our houses, coffee-table books have the status of vases or  sculptures. They are admired as objects, but to open one is to imply that one  is bored with the company.  </P> <P> My problem with coffee-table books is that our coffee table is covered with  them already, to a depth of three, yet I have never seen any guest of ours open  one, even for a cursory inspection.  </P> <P> I suspect that our guests are more interested in drinks and gossip than in  reading. As for me, I'm afraid I am too often seduced away from books by  television. On television, the pictures talk and move. And it is easier to turn  on the TV than to lift a four-pound book.  </P> <P> Coffee-table books have a long shelf life, but some of them get out of date.  One that now resides on our table is "The (London) Times Atlas of World  History." The book is 11 inches high and 14 1/2 inches deep -- too large for  any of our bookcases. It was inevitably consigned to the coffee table, where it  has lain for months, unopened. It appears to be an excellent book, with maps of  every historical period from the first farmers of 9000 BC to the present.  </P> <P> From time to time, I find other places for our coffee-table books. I have  already relocated a book about Maui, one on great Hollywood movies and one on  Paris, a richly illustrated exploration of that exciting city. The jacket is a  reproduction of Claude Monet's "Le Quai du Louvre," with the word Paris  scrawled across the blue sky in lipstick red.  </P> <P> That this book lay in plain sight on our coffee table for years without  attracting the slightest interest suggests that the coffee table is not a  successful setting for the display of books.  </P> <P> Our most recent acquisition is "Westwind," a splendid example of the genre at  its splashiest. "Westwind" is 12 1/2 inches high and 15 1/2 inches deep. It is  the story of a small-boat odyssey down the West Coast from Cape Flattery to  Ensenada. The text is by Walter Cronkite. The paintings, by his companion on  the voyage, Ray Ellis, are fresh, pretty, lush, evocative and serene. I did not  sample Cronkite's text, but I'm sure it is elegant. The book now resides on the  coffee table, where it doubtless will remain in virginal neglect.  </P> <P> It shares the table top with "A Day in the Country," a catalogue of the  splendid exhibition of impressionist paintings at the Los Angeles County Museum  of Art six years ago. The wraparound cover is a reproduction of Monet's "Train  in the Countryside." It shows a quaint little passenger train puffing along a  ridge behind trees and, below it, on the grass, a small child and a young woman  with a parasol.  </P> <P> You might think that cover would have seduced many of our guests into exploring  the catalogue and feasting on the sensually pretty evocations of the French  countryside it contains. I have always been especially enchanted by Monet's  "Terrace at Sainte-Andresse." One can almost feel the breeze that blows the  flags. So far as I know, the book has never been opened by anyone but me.  </P> <P> Some years ago I tried testing my guests by placing an unusual book on the  coffee table. It was an illustrated history of the Parisian bordello -- full of  arresting portraits of ladies of the night and illuminated by a factual,  sympathetic text. It remained on the table, in full sight, inviolate.  </P> <P> I have no doubt that such books are designed and published with the certain  knowledge that they will end up on coffee tables, never to be read or even  looked at. Still, they are there. One never knows when a child, bored by adult  chatter, may idly open one and be enchanted by a day in the French countryside  or a stroll through Paris.  </P> <P> Though I may ignore my own coffee-table books, I have a habit of picking up and  thumbing through those in the homes of my hosts. Usually, when I am caught  doing this, my host asks genially if I wouldn't like something from the bar,  and I realize that I am being impolite.  </P> <P> On the other hand, I do not want to let such social constraints keep me from  enjoying the landmark products of the press.  </P> <P> If anyone wants to give me a Gutenberg Bible, I accept.  </P></p>

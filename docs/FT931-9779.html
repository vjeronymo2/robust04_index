			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow reflects strong gains on jobs data Wall Street US EQUITY markets put in a solid performance yesterday, aided by strong demand for cyclical stocks, although all the major indices ended below the day's highs because of late selling, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was finally 10.27 up at 3,422.69, after standing almost 30 points ahead at one stage. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was a net 1.43 firmer at 447.66, while the Nasdaq composite gained just 0.86 on balance at 695.88. Trading volume on the New York SE was 257m shares. Advances in overseas equity markets set the tone for a strong New York opening, but it was not until mid-morning that demand really began to pick up. Sentiment was boosted by good news from the jobs area, where weekly unemployment insurance claims fell 12,000 in the last week of January (although this was partially offset by weak retail sales data), and by a strong rally in the bond market, which responded to an unexpectedly successful afternoon auction of new 30-year bonds. Corporate earnings continued to affect prices. General Motors was the day's main story, with the stock moving forward Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 40 1/2 in a volume of 11.3m shares after the car manufacturer reported a Dollars 23.5bn loss for 1992. This was primarily the result of extra-ordinary charges related to government mandated changes in accounting standards. The other two big car issues were also firmer: Chrysler put on Dollars 5/8 at Dollars 40 7/8 in busy trading after Salomon Brothers, the securities house, raised its earnings estimates for 1993, 1994 and 1995. Ford, which announced that it was to launch a credit card for customers in conjunction with Citibank, climbed Dollars 1 to Dollars 50 3/4 . IBM declined Dollars 1 to Dollars 51 1/8 in volume of 3.1m shares after announcing plans to increase the number of jobs it proposes to cut in North America. Sears Roebuck moved ahead Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 51 5/8 as it unveiled a five-year Dollars 4bn programme to upgrade its stores and announced details of a plan to complete an initial public offering of stock in its Dean Witter securities brokerage and credit card subsidiary. Cummins Engine advanced Dollars 3 to Dollars 84 1/2 on reporting strong fourth-quarter earnings as the company continues to recover from a string of losses. Canada TORONTO closed steady after heavy trading, but managed to extend its streak to nine straight sessions of gains. The TSE 300 index edged ahead just 0.2 to 3,443.2, although overall rises outnumbered declines by 348 to 282. Volume came to 52.8m shares valued at CDollars 491.3m. The gold shares group, which had advanced sharply in the previous two sessions on the rising bullion price, suffered a setback of 1.7 per cent as spot gold in New York shed USDollars 1 to USDollars 331.45 an ounce.</p>

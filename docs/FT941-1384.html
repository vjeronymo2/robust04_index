			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / People: Sir Michael Angus to chair Boots Sir Michael Angus, chairman of Whitbread and president of the CBI, is to take over as chairman of retailing and pharmaceuticals group Boots from July, in what analysts see as a highly significant appointment. There was speculation yesterday that he was being appointed to take some tough decisions at Boots - especially regarding the future of its pharmaceuticals business. Sir James Blyth, chief executive since 1987 and architect of the acquisition of Ward White and reorganisation of Boots group into separate business units, is being given the additional, and new, role, of deputy chairman. The announcement prompted speculation that he is being groomed eventually to succeed Sir Michael (right) as chairman. Sir Michael, 63, is appointed a non-executive director with immediate effect and will replace present chairman Sir Christopher Benson after the annual meeting on July 24. Sir Christopher, chairman of Sun Alliance and Costain as well as The Housing Corporation and The Funding Agency for Schools, has been chairman since 1990 but has taken a low profile during the past year. He was criticised for his handling of the group's annual meeting last year, which was disrupted by animal rights protesters. The more pugnacious Sir Michael, described by a former colleague as a 'tough, blunt businessman', spent much of his career with Unilever, after service with the RAF and a degree at Bristol University. After a spell as chairman and chief executive of Unilever US, during which he restructured the US business, he was group chairman from 1986 to 1992. He was credited with waking up a sleepy company, shedding some businesses and refocusing the group on its core activities. He has performed a similar task at Whitbread since 1992. He has also served as CBI president since 1992, forming an effective partnership with director-general Howard Davies. In addition to his capacity for taking tough decisions, Sir Michael's political influence and international experience are seen as assets to Boots, particularly as it seeks to expand its over-the-counter drugs business, Boots Healthcare International, overseas. 'The appointment of Sir Michael is quite a coup for us,' admits Boots. 'He is highly-regarded and wields considerable influence.'</p>

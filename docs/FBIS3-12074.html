			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Leticia Rodriguez Lopez] </F>   [Text] Ricardo Dajer Nahum, president of the Confederation  of National Chambers of Commerce, Concanaco, has said that  Mexico's economic project "has not drifted off course" and that  continuity of the country's economic policies is essential for  the population's tranquility.    Control of the country has not been lost. The course remains  the same. The "tragic" event in which presidential candidate  Luis Donaldo Colosio lost his life, which intended "to divide us  and make us confront one another," does not mean that Mexico "is  going overboard." For this reason, "we must remain calm and  have Mexico's future clearly before our eyes," he said.    The leader of the country's organized commerce said that,  although violence has increased in Mexico and there is even a  state of "psychosis" in some states because of kidnappings, the  possibility of establishing the death penalty in the country is  a delicate matter that requires a careful analysis and that  "very nearly requires a national forum."    In a news conference, Dajer Nahum said that more federal  highway police are needed, more training of the Judicial Branch  is required for this branch to act efficiently, and the  penalties passed should be "stiff enough" to discourage illegal  actions.    He also said that certain crimes, such as the kidnappings  that have caused "psychosis" in Sinaloa, Sonora, and Coahuila,  must be given special attention so they can be avoided and  resolved. Although, "technically" speaking, these types of  crimes could discourage investors, the crimes must be resolved,  not only for economic reasons but for the security to which all  Mexicans are entitled.    Dajer Nahum also said that the store owners' response to a  call for declaring a partial stoppage and then resuming their  activities at noon on 28 March has been favorable throughout the  country. He said this is a country-wide protest against the  recent violent events and at the same time reaffirms their  support for the Mexican Government. He added that the financial  cost of this stoppage will be minimal because stores will remain  closed only a few hours.    He went on to say that the social price is nonexistent  because the basic services employees have been asked to work  normally so the country's economic life is not disturbed at all.  He also said that the partial closure of stores throughout the  country will serve to repudiate violence and Luis Donaldo  Colosio's murder and to demand that the state of law, democracy,  harmony, and justice prevail.    Finally, he said he is sure the investigation of Colosio's  murder will yield results soon and that a clear report will be  issued so the community "can learn what the situation is."</p>

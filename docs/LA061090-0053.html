			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> SHAMIR FORMS FAR-RIGHT COALITION TO RULE ISRAEL  </P> <P> Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir formed the most right-wing coalition in Israeli  history Friday and said its top priority would be Jewish emigration from the  Soviet Union.  </P> <P> After protracted last-minute wrangling, seven right-wing and religious parties  and three independent members of the Knesset signed a coalition accord that  calls for expanded Jewish settlement in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.  </P> <P> The accord came 12 weeks after the dovish Labor Party brought down a national  unity government over Shamir's refusal to accept U.S. proposals for  Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.  </P> <P> The new government, which claims the backing of 62 members of the 120-seat  Knesset, will seek a vote of confidence Monday. But political sources said the  coalition was highly unstable and unlikely to last long.  </P> <P> Once it takes office, Shamir could quickly become a prisoner of hawks in his  own party, of ultraorthodox rabbis, and what one aide described as "right-wing  crazies."  </P> <P> The pressures may drive him to seek early elections or a renewed unity  government with Labor, political sources said.  </P> <P> "It's very difficult if you only have a narrow majority and you can be  blackmailed on every parliamentary vote. There will be three crises a week in  this coalition," a seasoned Cabinet official said.  </P> <P> The unpopularity of the new government, which opinion polls showed only 14% of  Israelis wanted, could also increase public pressure for a reform of an  electoral system that gives fringe parties the balance of power.  </P> <P> "Whatever government is formed, it is clear that Israel's political system is  rotten to the core," political commentator Yeshayahu Ben-Porat wrote in the  mass-circulation Yedioth Ahronoth. The newspaper Maariv, in an editorial,  lambasted the country's politicians as "pigs, pimps and prostitutes."  </P> <P> An exhausted-looking Shamir, 74, toasted his new coalition as "a national  government that will conduct affairs of state during a tough period with many  dangers."  </P> <P> But even after signing the pact, religious parties continued to haggle for  control of the ministries of religion and education.  </P> <P> "The government's main effort will be on the most important matter in our lives  today -- the mass immigration flowing into the country and the absorption (of  immigrants)," Shamir said.  </P> <P> Israel expects up to 250,000 Soviet Jews to arrive this year and Jewish Agency  officials disclosed last week that about 1.1 million Soviet Jews had received  immigration visas.  </P> <P> If it holds, the Cabinet will be dominated by opponents of peace talks with the  Palestinians and advocates of increased Jewish settlement in the occupied  territories.  </P> <P> Political commentators said it could set Israel on a collision course with the  United States, its guardian ally.  </P> <P> "Barring a miracle, Shamir will find himself in direct conflict with the United  States, the Soviet Union, Europe, the Palestinians and the Arab world,"  diplomatic commentator Akiva Eldar wrote in the Haaretz newspaper.  </P> <P> The coalition's policy guidelines said the new government would work to  "strengthen, expand and develop" Jewish settlement in the occupied West Bank  and Gaza Strip, the biggest source of friction between Israel and Washington.  </P> <P> "Settlement in all parts of the land of Israel is the right of the Jewish  people and an inseparable part of national security," the document said.  </P> <P> Shamir said he had not finalized Cabinet posts, but sources in his Likud party  said a troika of hard-liners -- David Levy, Ariel Sharon and Yitzhak Modai --  would receive the key ministries of foreign affairs, housing and finance.  </P> <P> Sharon, architect of Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon and the most  controversial figure in modern Israeli politics, will have overall control of  immigration.  </P> <P> Dubbed the "constraints ministers," the trio forced Shamir last July to accept  hard-line restrictions on his government's peace initiative for Palestinian  elections leading to self-rule in the occupied territories.  </P> <P> The new policy guidelines reaffirmed that plan, but added one key constraint --  ruling out Palestinian elections or autonomy in Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem.  </P></p>

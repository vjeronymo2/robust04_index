			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Observer: Yankees hacked off How much longer will America be prepared to accept the invasion of its media by journalists from its colonial past? Yesterday Martin Dunn, editor of Today - Britain's fastest growing newspaper - joined the westbound trek. Dunn had been pinning his hopes on getting the editorship of one of New York's ailing daily newspapers. In the event he has had to make do with the Boston Herald. His owner, Rupert Murdoch, has never had much luck with his US newspapers, and presumably now feels that his best chance of making a success with his sole remaining US daily is to import a former deputy editor of The Sun. It's hard to believe there is no US journalist up to the job. The Fleet Street invasion is already the subject of serious study. Columbia University is holding a seminar next month entitled 'The British are coming', which includes contributions from recent UK imports such as the editors of the National Review, The New Republic and TV Guide. And judging by the latest issue of Spy Magazine, a backlash against foreigners taking high-paying jobs away from Americans is spreading. Spy, whose co-founding Canadian editor now fills Britain's Tina Brown's spot at Vanity Fair, is concerned that the New Yorker, the city's most famous magazine, now has a London-based theatre critic, a British film critic and a foreign editor of its Talk of the Town column who had never heard of Page Six of the New York Post - a journalistic gaffe equal to not knowing about Page 3 of the Sun. How long before Washington's bureaucrats sit up and take an interest?</p>

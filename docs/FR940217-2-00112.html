PTC, at its discretion, will be entitled at a Fund's Termination Date to sell any one or more of the Fund assets to Penn Mutual for a cash price sufficient to obtain net proceeds equal to the aggregate of the Plan Account Amounts of plans holding units in the Fund. The obligations of the parties under these arrangements will be netted against one another, resulting in a ``swapping-out'' of the entire remaining portfolio at an amount equal to the aggregate Plan Account Amounts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13. Penn Mutual's fee for its minimum yield, liquidity guarantees and Plan Account Amount assurances will be an amount computed on and payable as of pre-set quarterly dates from each Fund. The fee will be equal to the product of the cost of the remaining invested assets in the Fund adjusted in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for amortization of premium and accretion of discount, times the Penn Mutual Quarterly Compensation Percentage specified in the applicable Fund Supplement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After consideration of the entire record, including the comment, the Department has determined to grant the exemption as amended in the manner described above.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> For Further Information Contact:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Ms. Lyssa E.

Furthermore, the fact that a transaction is subject to an administrative or statutory exemption is not dispositive of whether the transaction is in fact a prohibited transaction; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The availability of these exemptions is subject to the express condition that the material facts and representations contained in each application are true and complete and accurately describe all material terms of the transaction which is the subject of the exemption. In the case of continuing exemption transactions, if any of the material facts or representations described in the application change after the exemption is granted, the exemption will cease to apply as of the date of such change. In the event of any such change, application for a new exemption may be made to the Department.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Signed at Washington, DC, this 10th day of February 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Ivan Strasfeld,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Director of Exemption Determinations, Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration, U.S. Department of Labor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;3606 Filed 2&hyph;16&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4510&hyph;29&hyph;P <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

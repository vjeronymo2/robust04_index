			<p><P> August 18, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KUWAITI RAIDS FUEL IRAQ CRACKDOWN  </P> <P> Michael Ross of The Times' Washington Bureau is a member of the Pentagon press  pool currently in Saudi Arabia. This report was written for the pool, whose  members are not allowed to disclose their exact location.  </P> <P> Iraqi occupation forces in Kuwait have closed mosques and sealed the border  with Saudi Arabia in response to continuing hit-and-run attacks by Kuwaiti  resistance cells, according to refugees arriving here.  </P> <P> The resistance is still relatively small and uncoordinated, but "it is growing  as we become more organized," said a Kuwaiti shopkeeper, who fought with the  underground for nearly two weeks before the location of his cell was discovered  and surrounded by Iraqi tanks.  </P> <P> The shopkeeper, an army reservist who asked to be identified only as Nasser,  his first name, said resistance members were holding more than 150 Iraqi  soldiers prisoner.  </P> <P> They were captured, he said, in night-time raids on Iraqi patrols in  residential areas of the Kuwaiti capital.  </P> <P> Another refugee, a high school soccer coach who fled on Thursday, said Kuwaitis  knew that the resistance was continuing because scattered shooting could still  be heard throughout the city at night.  </P> <P> Abdullah Anazi, 37, said the Iraqis had imposed a curfew Wednesday because  "young Kuwaitis are shooting at their soldiers in the dark."  </P> <P> No formal curfew had been in effect before Wednesday, Anazi said, adding that  it was but one of several security measures the Iraqis have taken this week to  deal with the still small but apparently growing underground resistance.  </P> <P> "They also closed the mosques whose ulemas (prayer leaders) were denouncing the  Iraqis and speaking out against the invasion," Anazi said.  </P> <P> "It is the young people," he added. "They are the ones who are taking up arms  and fighting . . . but only at night."  </P> <P> Other newly arrived refugees also confirmed reports by Saudi sources that the  Iraqis have closed the border to Kuwaitis trying to enter Saudi Arabia. Until a  few days ago, the Iraqis were barring foreigners from leaving but were allowing  -- even encouraging -- Kuwaitis to go.  </P> <P> Saudi officials said more than 100,000 Kuwaitis were now in the kingdom but  that the flow of refugees abruptly slowed to a trickle a few days ago.  </P> <P> Anazi and another refugee who arrived in Saudi Arabia after the border was  closed said they escaped by crossing the desert at a remote spot far from the  frontier post where they had been turned back by Iraqi soldiers.  </P> <P> The refugees, interviewed at a school, a hotel and other locations where they  have been given temporary shelter by the Saudi government, gave similar  accounts of the Aug. 2 invasion, which appeared to have taken their tiny  country and its unprepared defense forces by complete surprise.  </P> <P> "We never thought they would do this to us," said Nasser Asmi, a 32-year-old  worker with the Kuwait Oil Co. "We thought, 'How could they do this to us, a  neighbor and fellow Muslim country?' But Saddam Hussein is a bad man. We never  had a chance."  </P> <P> Stunned into submission by the overwhelming size of the invasion force, the  Kuwaitis offered only scattered resistance for the first day.  </P> <P> "We woke up in the morning and found Iraqis everywhere," said Asmi.  </P> <P> Even though Iraqi troops had been massing on their borders, Kuwaiti leaders  apparently chose to believe Hussein's assurances, delivered to other Arab  governments, that he would not invade Kuwait.  </P> <P> As a result, the Kuwaiti National Guard was not on alert, and its main garrison  in the capital was nearly deserted on the morning of the invasion because most  of its men had been given the Thursday-Friday (Friday is the Muslim Sabbath)  weekend off, according to one of the defenders who escaped.  </P> <P> "Normally, there are about 2,000 soldiers stationed at the garrison, but there  were only about 120 on duty on the morning of the invasion," when the Iraqis  surrounded the garrison with tanks, said Cpl. Melfi Asmi, 34.  </P> <P> "We resisted all day, from 7 in the morning until 7 at night, but they were  firing at us from all sides," he said.  </P> <P> Asmi, who is Nasser Asmi's cousin, said about half the defenders were killed or  wounded before the rest chose to flee. "There was no officer there to make  decisions. The highest-ranking soldier was a sergeant. We did the best we  could, but at last we realized we would all be killed if we stayed," he said.  </P> <P> Nasser's garrison apparently held out longer than did the defenders at other  installations in Kuwait city.  </P> <P> In the first eyewitness account of the storming of the emir's palace, Mansour  Mohanni, 32, said that it fell to a force of "about 70 Iraqi commandos who came  over the back wall" at about 12:30 p.m., more than 10 hours after the initial  invasion.  </P> <P> "They came over the wall firing rockets and machine guns," said Mohanni, a  clerk at the palace.  </P> <P> He said the palace guards killed 15 of the Iraqis before being overwhelmed.  </P> <P> Mohanni, who escaped after the Iraqis entered the palace to hunt down the  remaining guards, said that the emir of Kuwait, Sheik Jabbar al Ahmed al Sabah,  was not there at the time of the attack. He said he knew how the emir had  escaped but would not divulge it.  </P> <P> The Kuwaitis who were interviewed all said that the invasion appeared to have  been well-planned. "They bombed the runways so our jet fighters could not take  off, and they cut the communications right away," leaving National Guard bases  throughout the country isolated from one another, Cpl. Asmi said.  </P> <P> "The Iraqis had very good intelligence. They knew where everything was. They  even knew where the foreigners lived," added Nasser, the shopkeeper and army  reservist.  </P> <P> While the thoroughness of their intelligence suggests that the Iraqis may have  been planning the invasion for some time, every Kuwaiti interviewed over the  past several days -- from senior government officials to ordinary citizens --  professed shock and profound disbelief at what had happened.  </P> <P> "I don't know why we were so complacent, so foolish," another refugee, who  asked not to be identified, said bitterly. "As Muslims, I guess we never  thought our brothers could do such a thing to us."  </P> <P> As the initial shock began to wear off, some Kuwaitis using arms taken from  police stations -- and from the Iraqi soldiers they later killed -- went  underground and began ambushing Iraqi patrols at night, Nasser said.  </P> <P> "We would not attack large groups of Iraqis, but if we saw two or three  together, we would shoot them," he added.  </P> <P> In the first week after the invasion, the troops patrolling the capital were  "relaxed" and undisciplined, Nasser said.  </P> <P> The soldiers who carried out the initial attack -- Iraq's elite Republican  Guards -- were withdrawn soon after the invasion and replaced by ordinary  troops, many of whom had been told by their commanders that they were going to  Kuwait to safeguard it from an American invasion, Nasser said.  </P> <P> "They did not expect us to attack them, so they were easy targets. These were  also the soldiers who did the terrible things, the ones who raped our women,"  he said.  </P> <P> "They looted everything," another Kuwaiti said. "They made motorists stop in  the street and give them their cars. They even stopped people on the street to  take the watches off their wrists."  </P> <P> Another witness said he saw some Iraqi soldiers shoot the plate-glass out of  the window of a Mercedes-Benz dealership and drive off with the cars. "They  took all the new American and European cars back to Baghdad," he said.  </P> <P> As the behavior of the occupying force became worse, the resistance grew  bolder, Nasser said.  </P> <P> He asked that his group's method of operations and the area in which it fought  not be disclosed in detail because his cell was still believed to be active.  </P> <P> However, he said that, on the third day following the invasion, he and his  friends chased two Iraqi soldiers into a restaurant, where they shot one and  captured the other.  </P> <P> "They tried to hide in a big refrigerator in the back of the restaurant. One  resisted and we killed him. The other one surrendered," Nasser said, adding  that the resistance was holding "about 150 Iraqis as prisoners" by the time he  left Kuwait last week.  </P> <P> Using gasoline bombs made from bottles with dates pressed into the necks to  hold the wicks in place, the group also disabled an Iraqi tank one night.  </P> <P> "The Iraqis would stand outside their tanks. We would sneak up and shoot the  men outside the tanks, then open the hatch and drop the bomb inside," Nasser  said.  </P> <P> He claimed that a number of tanks were disabled in this manner.  </P> <P> The resistance is still largely uncoordinated, "but we are getting more  organized and better disciplined every day," Nasser said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 3, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DOWNTOWN L.A. AREA FACES ROUND OF MEDFLY SPRAYING  </P> <P> After a three-week reprieve from malathion applications over Los Angeles  County, state officials announced Monday that downtown Los Angeles and numerous  surrounding neighborhoods must be sprayed for Mediterranean fruit flies.  </P> <P> A 14-square-mile sector will be visited weekly by malathion-bearing helicopters  for at least three weeks, beginning Thursday night, the officials said. The  decision to spray followed the trapping last week of a lone Medfly in a  back-yard peach tree near Echo Park, just west of downtown -- and less than a  mile from where an infestation that eventually spread throughout the region was  first detected last summer.  </P> <P> The treatment zone is bounded roughly by the Golden State Freeway and Hyperion  Avenue on the north, Vermont Avenue on the west, Olympic Boulevard on the South  and the Los Angeles River on the east. In addition to Echo Park, it encompasses  Silver Lake, Chinatown, parts of Koreatown and downtown's Bunker Hill and Skid  Row. Many of these neighborhoods had not been sprayed before.  </P> <P> Plans have been laid to bus homeless people to indoor shelters for the night.  The Dodgers also are scheduled to play a home game Thursday night at their  stadium within the treatment zone, but the spraying is expected to begin well  after the contest is completed.  </P> <P> The development marked a discouraging turn for the Medfly eradicators, who had  been buoyed by a two-month hiatus in new discoveries of the crop-destroying  pest. They had cut back the spray zone from more than 500 square miles at the  infestation's height to just 34 square miles in San Bernardino County.  </P> <P> "Of course, every new fly is a disappointment," said Roy Cunningham, a U.S.  Department of Agriculture entomologist and one of five scientists serving on  the state's Medfly Science Advisory Panel. "I was hoping things were coming to  an end."  </P> <P> The pesticide applications will be followed by release of millions of  sterilized fruit flies, which are intended to breed the fertile population out  of existence over the span of three mating cycles. Should the sometimes  troublesome supply of sterile flies run short, officials warned, it could  necessitate several additional pesticide applications.  </P> <P> In El Cajon, where malathion has been sprayed three times to eradicate an  infestation of Mexican fruit flies, no new flies have been found since May 5,  when two egg-bearing females were trapped, said Connie Smith, a spokeswoman for  the California Department of Food and Agriculture. A mature male Mexfly was  trapped near the same site April 25.  </P> <P> Trapping was intensified before three aerial applications of malathion in June  over 16 square miles of El Cajon, and trapping will be reintensified at the end  of the summer, after the last batch of sterile Mexflies is released, Smith  said.  </P> <P> No wild Mediterranean fruit flies have been found in the San Diego area since  one was trapped in 1986.  </P> <P> The crucial question now is whether the Medfly found in Echo Park is the first  of a summer onslaught or an isolated find that represents the last remnants of  the old infestation.  </P> <P> Cunningham said he believes that the long period between the new discovery and  the last Medfly trapping on May 1 is an encouraging sign that the tide has  turned against the pest.  </P> <P> "By this time we should be finding lots of flies if we had made serious  errors," Cunningham said. "It looks like we're doing the right thing because  we're not finding oodles of flies."  </P> <P> He noted that eradication officials had expected to trap a few flies in the  summer months, when the hot weather and abundance of ripe fruit offers ideal  breeding conditions for the Medfly.  </P> <P> "It's not unexpected," he said. "We all knew that we hadn't reached the point  of celebrating yet. We really have to get through August for that."  </P> <P> James R. Carey, a UC Davis entomologist who also serves on the Medfly Science  Advisory Panel, has long warned that the summer could bring a resurgence of the  Medfly.  </P> <P> Carey has plotted the dates of all Medfly discoveries in California since 1975,  when the first infestation in the state occurred, and found that the vast  majority of Medflies were trapped in July, August and September.  </P> <P> According to Carey's figures, only 9% of Medflies had been trapped from January  to July over the last 15 years, while 69% were trapped in August, September and  October.  </P> <P> It is Carey's belief, based on his statistical research, that the Medfly has  never been fully eradicated from the state, but that a porous system of  trapping makes it seem as though the pest has vanished.  </P> <P> The Medfly -- which lays its eggs in a variety of fruits and vegetables -- is  considered a major threat to the state's $17-billion farm industry.  </P> <P> Opponents of the aerial pesticide applications were upset by Monday's  announcement.  </P> <P> Adelaide Nimitz, president of the community group Families Opposed to Chemical  Urban Spraying, said the discovery of a Medfly so near a previous treatment  zone reinforced her belief that the eradication campaign is failing.  </P> <P> "No, it's not over yet," Nimitz said. "It's exactly what we knew would happen."  </P> <P> Joel Reynolds, senior staff attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council,  an environmental group, said the new spraying may cause serious problems  because it will encompass the large homeless population downtown.  </P> <P> "It's a huge area with one of the largest concentrations of homeless in the  country," Reynolds said. "We are very concerned."  </P> <P> The city of Los Angeles announced plans late Monday to notify the homeless  throughout downtown of the spraying and provide them temporary shelter. Sue  Flores, director of human services for the city, said the city will pick up  homeless people downtown and bus them to temporary shelters.  </P> <P> The city has moved homeless residents before because of malathion spraying that  touched fringes of downtown. She said only a few dozen of the estimated 1,000  homeless in Skid Row took advantage of the service.  </P> <P> Alice Callaghan, director of Las Familias del Pueblo, a community center in  Skid Row, said the biggest problem would not be moving the homeless, but  getting the word out to them that spraying will occur.  </P> <P> "How do you find over 1,000 homeless adults?" she asked. "It's an absurd  notion. They're spread everywhere."  </P> <P> Los Angeles County Agricultural Commissioner E. Leon Spaugy, a co-director of  the eradication project, expressed confidence that, despite the setback, the  campaign, overall, is succeeding.  </P> <P> "I think we're still on course," he said.  </P> <P> Spaugy said there should be few problems in handling the new outbreak, but he  is concerned about two potential difficulties: locating an airport from which  to launch the squadron of malathion-spraying helicopters, and securing a  sufficient supply of sterile flies to phase out spraying in Echo Park after  three weeks.  </P> <P> Throughout most of the eradication campaign, the helicopters flew out of El  Monte Airport and then Riverside Airport. Los Angeles County officials,  however, complained that El Monte has carried too much of the burden and have  opposed efforts to use the airport to stage flights to spray zones far from El  Monte. The Los Angeles City Council also has been discussing a ban on using  city airports for malathion spraying.  </P> <P> Spaugy said the state intends to launch from Riverside Airport for the first  spraying on July 5. After that, however, he is not sure which facility will be  used. Under emergency powers given to the eradication campaign by the governor,  the campaign technically can fly its helicopters from wherever it wants.  Officials, however, have shown a sensitivity to the political nuances of the  controversial program, especially in its latter stages.  </P> <P> The eradication campaign has suffered occasionally from shortfalls in the  number of sterile flies from breeding facilities in Hawaii. The shortfalls have  been blamed on pesticide contamination in the food used to rear the sterile  insects.  </P> <P> The shortage, which at one point left the eradication project with a third less  sterile flies than scientists had recommended, has resulted in a dilution of  the treatment program -- a move that some of the state's scientific advisers  have warned could open a "window of opportunity" for the pest to breed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> MALATHION SPRAYING  </P> <P> The state Department of Food and Agriculture has announced plans to conduct  aerial spraying of malathion in a 14-square-mile area including downtown Los  Angeles and numerous surrounding neighborhoods. Three aerial applications of  malathion will be made, followed by the release of sterile Medflies. If sterile  Medflies are unavailable, additional malathion spraying will be conducted. The  first spraying is scheduled for Thursday, to be conducted between 9 p.m. and 3  a.m., weather permitting.  </P> <P> Precautions: Stay indoors; keep animals indoors; wash animal dishes and toys  left outside; cover cars; keep doors and windows closed.  </P> <P> Information: Toll-free numbers for the Agricultural Commissioner: (800)  356-2894; (800) 225-1346.  </P></p>

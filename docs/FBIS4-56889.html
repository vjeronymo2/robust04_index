			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Panamanian President-elect Ernesto Perez  Balladares has asserted that during his term, the Panamanian  Government will maintain dignified and respectful relations with  Cuba. Perez Balladares confirmed that the ties with Cuba will be  equal to those maintained with any other nation. He went on to  say that ties between Cuba and Panama will be characterized by  respect for their existing political systems and noninterference  in the internal affairs of either nation.    Relations between these nations became virtually nonexistent  following the violent U.S. invasion of Panama on 20 December  1989, and at the moment, contacts are conducted at interim  charge d'affaires level.

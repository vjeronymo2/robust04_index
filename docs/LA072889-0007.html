			<p><P> July 28, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENTALISTS SPLIT ON LOGGING PLAN  </P> <P> Environmentalists were sharply split Thursday over a logging plan approved by  the U.S. Senate, with some praising it as a landmark improvement in forest  management and others excoriating it as an attack on major environmental laws.  </P> <P> The plan, part of the Department of Agriculture appropriation for 1990, was  introduced by Sens. Mark O. Hatfield (R-Ore.) and Brock Adams (D-Wash.) to try  to ease a log shortage that threatens the Pacific Northwest timber industry.  </P> <P> The plan would permit the harvest of 10 billion board-feet of timber from  Oregon and Washington lands managed by the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of  Land Management -- a compromise between industry and environmentalist levels.  </P> <P> The plan also for the first time acknowledges the existence and importance of  virgin, old-growth forests, which provide vital wildlife habitat, superior  watershed and exceptional recreation.  </P> <P> On the other side, it also restricts how much federal courts can interfere with  harvest plans that may threaten the forests. The courts would still be allowed  to review each timber sale but could not stop any one of them without first  conducting a full trial.  </P> <P> Some environmental groups, such as the Audubon Society and Sierra Club, say the  old-growth sections are a major step forward in federal forest management.  Others, including the Wilderness Society and Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund,  say the legal restrictions severely weaken existing environmental laws.  </P> <P> "For the first time in history, they are giving legal protection to old  growth," said Audubon Society Vice President Brock Evans. "They defined what  old-growth is and are telling the Forest Service to stay out of it whenever  possible. . . . We think substantial progress has been made."  </P> <P> "It is completely unsatisfactory," rejoined Wilderness Society spokesman  Richard Hoppe. "The Senate bill will give the Forest Service the authority to  ignore all the major environmental legislation that regulates its activity."  </P> <P> "It is an invitation to illegal action and a license to commit it," added Vic  Sher of the Sierra Club Legal Defense Club, which operates separately from the  Sierra Club itself.  </P> <P> Both environmentalist camps said they would try to strengthen the bill when a  conference committee reconciles differences in Agriculture budgets passed by  the House and Senate. Over the last two years, environmentalists have won  sweeping federal court injunctions to protect old-growth from being cut because  logging appeared to threaten the northern spotted owl with extinction. Those  orders have blocked more than a fourth of federal timber sales in Oregon and  Washington.  </P> <P> The timber industry blames this for a log shortage that has closed at least 30  mills and threatens to close many more by this winter. But others have said  mill consolidation, automation and raw-log exports are to blame.  </P></p>

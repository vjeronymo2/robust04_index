			<p>BFN     [Text] Special Public Prosecutor Raja Abdul Aziz Bhatti  yesterday filed two criminal cases of defamation against  Mohammad Nawaz Sharif in the court of the district and sessions  judge of Rawalpindi on behalf of the president and the prime  minister.    During a news conference on 30 April in Karachi, Mohammad  Nawaz Sharif had reportedly leveled serious charges of  corruption against the president, prime minister and her  husband, and the federal commerce minister in the cotton export  deal. While challenging these charges, the special public  prosecutor said that these charges were false, baseless, and  devoid of truth. He said this has not only hurt the prestige of  the president, the prime minister and her husband and the  federal commerce minister, but the people were misled by its  widespread publicity.    The court has summoned Mohammad Nawaz Sharif on 4 July.</p>

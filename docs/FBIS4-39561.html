			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 9 TASS -- Confidence that "a single  confederative state will appear with time on the territory of  the former Soviet Union" was voiced by Federation Council  chairman Vladimir Shumeyko during today's meeting with  journalists in Moscow. Shumeyko added that "later, we shall  probably live to see a federation, each member of which will  remain free".    According to Vladimir Shumeyko, the former Soviet republics  will never give up their freedom, but will continue to gravitate  towards one another on the strength of their economic, cultural,  and spiritual traditions. Shumeyko noted that the Baltic  republics alone are not "seeking contacts with the former Union  parts, while all the others are feeling the attraction".    In this connection, the head of the upper chamber of the  Russian parliament expressed his belief that in Byelorussia  [Belarus] and Ukraine "the people will vote in the presidential  elections for those whose attitude to Russia they think correct".    Vladimir Shumeyko said the council of the heads of  parliaments of the Commonwealth member-states, which met in St.  Petersburg the other day, discussed strengthening economic ties  in the framework of the Commonwealth of Independent States.  Participants in the discussion said the creation of a strong  union can be boosted by legislative acts and it is necessary to  "provide a legal frame for the economic union".    The council adopted a resolution on CIS peacekeeping forces,  which also calls for preparing a relevant regulation. Shumeyko  noted that the CIS peacekeeping forces already exist de facto,  but mainly at a cost to Russia. According to Shumeyko, this  gives rise to rumours about Russia's alleged imperial ambitions.  In order to avoid such rumours and ease Russia's economic  burden in maintaining the forces, it is necessary to create CIS  collective forces.    Shumeyko said that the participants in the St. Petersburg  forum called for joining the Commonwealth summit on September 9  to discuss this proposal, as well as preparations for the  festivities marking the fiftieth anniversary of the victory in  the last world war.</p>

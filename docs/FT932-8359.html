			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Rentokil makes hostile bid for Securiguard RENTOKIL Group, the environmental and property services company, yesterday launched a hostile Pounds 59.2m all cash bid for Securiguard, the provider of security and cleaning services in the UK and US. The offer was rejected by Securiguard's board, who said it 'significantly' undervalued the company and advised shareholders not to sell. The 270p a share offer represented a 46 per cent premium to Securiguard's closing price on Monday of 185p. Following Securiguard's rejection, its shares closed 19p above the offer price at 289p, suggesting the market expected Rentokil to raise its offer. 'People can see how this deal will help Rentokil's earnings and so expect them to go a bit higher to get the bid recommended,' an analyst said. Mr Clive Thompson, Rentokil's chief executive, said the company saw security and guarding services as a good fit with its other business services, like property management. Securiguard's cleaning activities, expanded in 1990 through the purchase of Madison, could fit with Rentokil's office cleaning activities, Mr Thompson said. Rentokil appeared less interested in Securiguard's other divisions, communications and personnel. Securiguard, which gained a full listing in 1987, has seen its shares underperform since 1990 because of fears about the quality of its management and business. Although it holds some high profile contracts, such as providing security for New York's Kennedy airport, its cleaning division is thought to be skewed towards low margin, local authority business. In the year to November, the company reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.74m on sales of Pounds 165.1m. One stock market analyst expects profits this year of Pounds 6.2m, putting the shares on 13.8 times earnings at yesterday's closing price. Securiguard had net assets of Pounds 2.68m at its year end. Rentokil said it would need to write off about Pounds 57m in goodwill if the bid succeeded. According to analysts, the acquisition would enhance short term earnings at Rentokil, which had net cash of Pounds 60.2m at December 31. However, the company's shares fell 4p to 193p on concerns about longer term earnings growth and questions about the quality of Securiguard's profits. Mr Thompson said Rentokil believed customers increasingly wanted quality security services and this would allow improved margins. Securiguard employs about 15,000 people, including part time workers. Rentokil is making the offer through its financial adviser County NatWest. Securiguard is advised by BZW.</p>

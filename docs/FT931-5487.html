			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Hambro Countrywide cuts loss to Pounds 3m HAMBRO Countrywide, the estate agency and financial services chain, cut its pre-tax loss from Pounds 6.49m to Pounds 3.14m in the 12 months to December 31. However, the result, prepared on the basis of FRS 3, included a gain of Pounds 6.06m from the sale of a 49 per cent holding in Hambro Legal Protection. Turnover fell from Pounds 93.2m to Pounds 90.8m, with losses per share up from 0.95p to 0.99p. As in 1992, the company is proposing to pass the final dividend, leaving shareholders with the nominal 0.05p per share paid after the interim results. Pointing to estimates that the number of houses sold nationally fell by 23 per cent during 1992, the company believed it did well to achieve sales down by only 3.2 per cent. The loss on the estate agency side was Pounds 13.6m, offset by profits from the sale of financial products. Hambro Guardian Consultancy arranged 6,918 policies, up 95 per cent. The estate agency chain was cut from 487 branches to 455. Mr John May, managing director, said that with a significant revival of business there were no plans for further cuts. The company was instead looking for 'expansion in due course'. Net debt rose to Pounds 12.3m (Pounds 11.9m) at the year end, taking gearing to 23 per cent (22 per cent). To break even on estate agency this year, the company estimated it needs to increase sales from last year's 39,000 to about 43,000. On the basis of sales in the first two months - February was the best month since June 1988  -it believes it is well ahead of that target. But, added Mr May, 'recovery is fragile and many challenges and uncertainties remain'. UBS Phillips and Drew are forecasting a return to the black for the first time since 1988, with profits of about Pounds 5m for the group this year.</p>

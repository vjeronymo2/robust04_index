			<p><P> October 7, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FOOTHILL REGROUPS, CHARGES BACK TO EDGE IRVINE, 21-17  </P> <P> With the help of a team meeting, Foothill High School came back from a 17-point  halftime deficit to defeat Irvine High School, 21-17, Friday night at Tustin  High.  </P> <P> "The key to this win was an incredible halftime speech," Foothill Coach Marty  McWhinney said. "And it wasn't by (the coaching staff). The kids asked us to  leave and I don't know what went on in there."  </P> <P> Quarterback John Shanahan said, "Our team had been playing lethargic so we  (Shanahan and co-captains Jamal Duff and Jason Hairston) knew we had to do  something. We told the team we had to win this for us and no one else. It was  incredibly inspirational."  </P> <P> The Knights came back strong in the second half, with Sean Saunders gaining 123  of his 135 yards rushing in the second half. Three minutes into the third  quarter, Shanahan scored on a one-yard run and Kent Donnelly kicked the extra  point to pull Foothill (2-3) within 17-7. Later in the quarter, Jamal Duff  caught a 33-yard touchdown pass from Shanahan.  </P> <P> With one minute remaining, Shanahan ran for another one-yard touchdown, with  Donnelly's kick completing the play.  </P> <P> For Irvine (2-3), Shad Vickers ran for a one-yard touchdown, Mark Huffman  kicked three field goals and Brandon Krabbe intercepted two passes.

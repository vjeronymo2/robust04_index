			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Threat to Nasa's space station The House of Representatives could this week move to force the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to abandon its Dollars 30bn (Pounds 19.3bn) space station project. The project last year survived by a single vote in the House. The Clinton administration is predicting a more comfortable margin this year, but congressional opponents claim they have the votes to kill the project outright. The House appropriations sub-committee has proposed cuts of Dollars 240m in Nasa's budget for fiscal 1995, but has left the space station budget intact, at around Dollars 2.1bn. Nasa has requested a total budget of Dollars 14.3bn for 1995. The sub-committee is instead proposing cuts of Dollars 127m to the space shuttle programme, Nasa's manned space flight project. The shuttle will fly eight missions next year instead of nine, and plans to upgrade hardware have been postponed or abandonned. However, in the House vote, which could take place as early as today, opponents of the planned station are likely to introduce an amendment to kill it completely. The amended bill would then go to the Senate where, within the next two weeks, the Senate sub-committee, in its parallel consideration, is likely to recommend cuts of up to Dollars 600m in Nasa's budget. Mr Daniel Goldin, Nasa administrator, whose agency has taken a 30 per cent budget cut over the past two years, has pleaded with senators not to slash his budget again. However, any reconciliation of the amendment to abandon the station from the House and the proposed cuts of Dollars 600m from the Senate would be likely to mean the end of the space station.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Roseau, Dominica, 28 Jan, CANA -- Dominica's trade  minister, Charles Maynard, says he is more interested in having  better Caribbean trade than in boosting trade among the wider  developing nations. For example, he said, over any "South/South"  trade, he would welcome an opportunity for "shipping things into  Barbados."    "Let us look at more trade with our neighbours. Let us look  at more trade in Caricom (the Caribbean Community). Let us look  at more trade with Guadeloupe and Martinique," Maynard  suggested. He was reacting to agronomist Arthie Martin's  suggestion that Caribbean countries should engage in more  South/South trade.    Martin said that traditional trading arrangement which small  countries like Dominica have with the industrialised world might  take a beating from international trade arrangements like the  North American Free Trade Agreement and the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade.    Maynard said: "We have engaged in a programme of moving into  trade with Venezuela... Despite that, this has been on for more  than a year ... We have not seen any breakthrough." He also  pointed to trade-related matters with Colombia and other Latin  American countries, which "have remained merely at the level of  discussions." He urged local manufacturers here to try to expand  their exports in and out of the region.</p>

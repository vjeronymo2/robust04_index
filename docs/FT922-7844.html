			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Royal first-quarter losses reduced sharply to Pounds 48m - Further evidence of recovery in insurance industry ROYAL INSURANCE, the composite insurance company, yesterday announced a reduced pre-tax loss for the three months to March 31, providing further evidence that the industry may be returning to profitability after recent heavy losses. Earlier this week General Accident also reported reduced losses for the first quarter, while Guardian Royal Exchange - which does not report on a quarterly basis - has also indicated that trading conditions are improving. Royal's pre-tax losses were reduced from Pounds 63m to Pounds 48m, largely because of an improvement in underwriting results in the UK and the US, where the benefit of premium increases, introduced over the last two years, and stricter controls over underwriting is now being felt. Worldwide underwriting losses amounted to Pounds 57m compared with Pounds 84m. Life profits were down to Pounds 14m (Pounds 16m). Investment income fell to Pounds 6m (Pounds 15m) while other income amounted to Pounds 6m (Pounds 6m) and share of associated income Pounds 5m (Pounds 10m). Loan interest for group financing amounted to Pounds 10m (Pounds 14m). UK underwriting losses fell by Pounds 15m to Pounds 91m with the combined ratio in the UK (claims plus expenses against premiums) improving by nearly 6 points to 125 per cent. The reduction of underwriting losses to Pounds 6m (Pounds 18m) on the motor account, where insurers were affected adversely last year by increased theft, climbing claims costs and a rising frequency of claims, is seen as particularly encouraging. Underwriting losses for domestic mortgage indemnity business amounted to Pounds 50m, some Pounds 33m less than in the fourth quarter of 1991, although elsewhere on the household account, Royal recorded an underwriting profit. The solvency margin, which measures net assets as a percentage of non-life premium income, remains the main blackspot. Following a fall in US bond prices the margin fell to 29 per cent at the end of the third quarter, nearly twice the legal minimum but one point below the level generally regarded as adequate in the industry. Over the last months the solvency margin has risen to 32 per cent, with the post-election recovery in the UK equity markets helping to bolster capital.</p>

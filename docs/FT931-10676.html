			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Receiver at Crown's French arm RFM, the French radio network that triggered the collapse of Crown Communications, has itself gone into receivership. However, the network, which has a total of 114 stations and goes under the slogan 'Tous les tops, toute la Pop sans les flops (all the tops, all the hits and none of the flops) is still on the air. The intention is to run it as a going concern while the merits of three different rescue plans are considered. The salaries of staff will be paid out of advertising revenue. The collapse of Crown followed the decision of the CSA, the French broadcasting authority, to block the sale of the network to a consor-tium that included NRJ, a rival French radio network, and Mr Alain Ayache, a contro-versial right-of-centre magazine pub-lisher. The NRJ consortium is one of those now trying to buy the network from the receiver. TF1, the French first television channel, has also made a proposal to save the radio network. The third rescue plan is for a management buy-out of RFM. CSA approval will be needed for any change of ownership at the radio network. Crown had debts of Pounds 16m when it went into receivership, most of them because of the French operation. Crown's main business, LBC, the London talk-based commercial radio station, did not go into receivership and is now under the effective control of Chelverton Investments, a company set up by Mr John Porter, son of Dame Shirley Porter, and his partner Mr Matthew Cartisser.</p>

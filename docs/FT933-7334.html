			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Arts: All animated about fairy tales - Tim Burt discusses Disney's plans to reinvigorate the cinema cartoon / Screen THE RENAISSANCE started with a rabbit called Roger. Although a little slow and rather clumsy, Roger has reinvigorated the world's appetite for an art form that 10 years ago was said to be facing extinction - the cinema cartoon. Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, released by Touchstone in 1988, won critical acclaim and a couple of Oscars; more importantly, it grossed Dollars 154m and persuaded Walt Disney, the US entertainment group, there was money in feature-length animated films. Disney, concerned at the losses on its theme park investment in Europe, has decided to increase production of its profitable feature films. In the past, movies were released at a rate of one every three years; that gap narrowed last year with Aladdin, Disney's latest offering, following the success in 1991 of Beauty and the Beast. The company now to plans to produce two feature-length animated films a year and is banking on European expertise to help draw them. The US company regards Europe, and London in particular, as a centre for excellence in modern animation. So the skills which first gained international recognition with the antics of Roger Rabbit are now being actively pursued by the most famous studios of them all. A senior executive from Walt Disney this week arrived in London to recruit artists for a new generation of animated films. Unlike classics such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, these productions will not be years but months in the making. Max Howard, vice president of Walt Disney Animation in Florida, thinks European animators are the ones to make it happen. Walt Disney, he says, is keen to produce more animated features because, against all the expectations of the early 1980s, they are proving wildly popular. Attracted by the new dimensions of Who Framed Roger Rabbit? - the first widely-distributed feature to use computer technology - cinema audiences have flocked to see Beauty and the Beast, which grossed Dollars 147m in the US and Pounds 94m in the UK. In Aladdin, due to be released in the UK later this year, one of the characters is entirely computer driven. A magic carpet - hand drawn and then committed to a computer's memory - moves around the screen in a way few artists could emulate. It turns and twist in three dimensions, offering the directors camera angles which where previously only available to live film features. Howard, who ran the Walt Disney studio in London where Roger Rabbit was made, believes computers now allow an audience to enter the world of the cartoon characters. That faith has paid off handsomely. Aladdin has grossed more than Dollars 212m in the US and Walt Disney expects that figure to double after its international release. Audience demand for such special effects has been a major catalyst for Disney, which intends to employ some of Britain's best animators on future production such as The Hunchback of Notre Dame and Pocahontas, both scheduled for release in 1995. There has also been a lucrative spin-off for other UK talent including lyricist Tim Rice, who is currently working on The Lion King, Disney's animated African tale, along with actor Jeremy Irons and rock star Elton John. At the company's studios in Glendale and Orlando, however, the contribution of these famous names pales against that of James Baxter, a London art school graduate recruited by Disney after working on Roger Rabbit. Baxter went on to create Belle, the feisty heroine of Beauty and the Beast. The US group's willingness to import overseas talent, however, masks a growing frustration in the UK that there are no backers willing to underwrite a home-produce animation feature. Richard Williams, the creator of Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, has failed to complete his long-awaited Thief and The Cobbler and has returned disillusioned to his native Canada. Only on television, where Channel Four and SC4 in Wales have invested heavily in animation, is there a growing market. But even so, many independent producers feel acclaimed outside the UK and ignored at home. David Sproxton, co-director of Aardman Animation in Bristol, which last year won an Oscar for best animated short film, says, 'The fact that Disney can come here reflects that we do not have resources. We have skills and ideas but not finance.' He fears that overseas studios are snapping up UK animators because there is not enough work at home. Without substantial financial backing, he predicts most animation studios will go on doing what they do best - making TV commercials. At Disney, Max Howard admits that funding has been the main brake on UK animation but suggests that the industry may also have been hindered by the stories it decided to bring to the screen. Walt Disney is not taking that kind of risk. It plans to serve up more favourite dishes - fairy tales and fables. Howard says the productions coming across the Atlantic now contain fewer spoonfuls of sugar than in the past, but Disney is determined to pour in enough syrup to keep hold of its biggest audience, the young teenagers. 'Great quality animation won't make a film a success,' he says. 'Look at Aladdin or Beauty and the Beast. There has been a renaissance, but it's still about finding the right stories to tell.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Vyacheslav Kevorkov and </F> Gennadiy Kulbitskiy]    [Text] Bonn, 3 Mar -- "We regard our visit to the FRG as  very important and we hope that it will help to activate  economic cooperation and give renewed impetus to the political  dialogue between the leadership of the two countries." This was  stated today in an exclusive interview given to the ITAR-TASS  correspondents by Pyotr Krawchanka, Belarus foreign minister,  who is on an official visit to the FRG.    The signing took place in Bonn today of two important  documents -- an agreement on cooperation in the sphere of  culture and also a memorandum on cooperation in alleviating the  consequences of the Chernobyl disaster. "At the present time,"  the head of Belarus' foreign policy department continued, "we  have begun work on preparing further accords, which will be  signed during forthcoming visits at a higher level."    "The Belarus side is satisfied with the level of development  of relations with the Federal Republic of Germany. At least  they look more solid than those with any other Western European  country: We have credits and joint enterprises. Germany is our  number one partner among Western countries; it occupies first  place in our exports and imports. Today we can state that  Germany takes its obligations to Belarus very seriously. The  fact that half the government guarantees for goods deliveries  and credits for our country is equal to the whole credit  allocated to Ukraine -- totaling 300 million German marks --  shows that the Germans' intentions are serious.    The minister was asked a question about the Belarusian  leadership's attitude to the Partnership for Peace program  approved recently by NATO. "On the whole, we are positive about  this idea. It will be discussed in the Belarus Security Council  and in the Belarusian parliament, after which Belarus' official  position will be drawn up," he said.    Stressing that considerable attention was paid to  disarmament  problems during his discussion with German Foreign Minister K.  Kinkel, the minister pointed out that "under its international  obligations, Belarus is due to destroy at least 2,000 tanks,  1,650 APC's, and 150 aircraft. The number of tanks to be  destroyed is the highest in Europe. These tanks do not belong  to us, yet it is we who must destroy them. This is why we need  technological and financial assistance now. In particular, it  is well-known that this process requires a large quantity of  energy."    Answering a question from the ITAR-TASS correspondent about  the Belarusian leadership's attitude to Gazprom's decision to  reduce gas deliveries beginning today [3 March], the Belarusian  foreign minister said, "I think this issue is not political, but  economic. After all, we have signed a preliminary agreement with  Gazprom to set up a unified Russian-Belarusian joint-stock  company, and we expect that Russia will sell us gas not at  contract prices, but at the prices charged on the domestic  Russian market."    The Belarusian foreign minister's visit to Germany lasts  until 5 March.</p>

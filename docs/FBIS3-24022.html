The trend in the slump in the gross  national product and national income continues, although some  slowing down in its rate has been noted.    Difficulties with material-technical supplies, the  disruption  in economic relations, the continuous increase in prices, and  the insolvency of enterprises have led to a further drop in  industrial production. The slow process in destatization did not  give positive results. A reduction in production occurred at  enterprises of almost all forms of property, except collective,  but its negligible proportion had no effect on the results of  the work of all of industry.    While in the first half year of 1993, the rates of cuts in  production slowed down somewhat, in the second half of the year  the slump in production intensified and for the whole year  exceeded 7 percent. Labor productivity fell by 3 percent. Every  second enterprise reduced the volume of production of products  compared to last year. The biggest slump in production was in  enterprises of the oil refining, chemical and petrochemical, and  coal industries, in ferrous metallurgy, the building materials  industry, and in light industry.    The intensification of crisis phenomena in industry is  connected in some measure with the reduction in production  volumes in the fuel-energy complex. The extraction of the basic  types of fuel in a standard calculation was reduced for the year  by 12 percent. The extraction of oil and gas condensate was less  by 5 percent, coal--by 13 percent, including coke--by 17  percent, and gas--by 8 percent. As a result of a decrease in  extraction and a reduction in imported deliveries, the volumes  of refined oil decreased by 15 million tonnes, or by 39 percent,  and, as a consequence, the output of motor vehicle gas was cut  by 35 percent (1.9 million tonnes), diesel fuel by 24 percent (2  million tonnes), mazut fuel by 40 percent (7 million tonnes).  The shortage of fuel affected the volumes of production of  electric power--at thermal electric power stations whose share  in the total development of electric power exceeds 60 percent.  For the year, the thermal power stations cut the production of  electric power by 16 percent, as a result of which its total  output decreased by 9 percent. At the same time, more electric  power was produced by nuclear and hydroelectric power stations  (by 2 and 39 percent, respectively) than in 1992.    The tense situation with the production and supply of  fuel-energy resources had a negative effect on other branches of  industry, and especially on metallurgy, one of the most fuel and  energy-consuming industries. By comparison with the 1992 level,  the production of all of the main types of products of industry  decreased.    Production was cut in nonferrous metallurgy enterprises, in  the chemical industry, in machine building, and in the building  materials industry.    The situation remained difficult in agriculture in 1993. At  the same time, some symptoms of its stabilization appeared. The  rates of reduction in the production of agricultural products  were reduced substantially. The volume of gross products in  comparison with the previous year decreased only by 2 percent,  and, at the same time, plant-growing products increased by 7  percent.    Farms of all categories produced 45.6 million tonnes of  grain  in weight after processing, which is 18.3 percent more than in  1992; sugar beets (factory)--33.6 million tonnes (by 16.8  percent); potatoes--20.9 million tonnes (by 3.3 percent more);  vegetables--5.8 million tonnes (10.1 percent more); and  sunflowers--2.2 million tonnes (at the level of the previous  year).    The situation in livestock raising remains acute. Sovkhozes  and collective and interfarm agricultural enterprises in 1993  produced 2.6 million tonnes of meat in live weight, which is 23  percent less than in 1992; 11.6 million tonnes of milk (by 10  percent less); 6.1 billion eggs of all types (by 18 percent  less). The production of livestock products in subsidiary farms  of the population increased.    A negative trend in the reduction of the total number of  cattle and a drop in its productivity in the public sector  continued.    Capital construction during the report period was  characterized by an imbalance between investment programs and  the financial capabilities for their implementation in  connection with the continuous increase in prices for building  materials and energy sources.    Because of inadequate financing (in the main), the start-up  program for putting important production and environmental  protection facilities into operation was not implemented. Out of  343 facilities that were included by name in Ukraine's 1993  state contract, only one-sixth were put into operation, of which  almost a fourth were only partially implemented.    A further worsening occurred in 1993 in the condition of  national economic and passenger transportation by all types of  transport of the country.    During 1993, the unbalance of state finances became more  pronounced. According to preliminary data of the Ministry of  Finance of Ukraine, the consolidated budget of Ukraine for the  year came to a deficit of 7.9 trillion karbovantsy, which  constituted 6.8 percent with respect to the gross domestic  product.    There was an expenditure from the budget for the national  economy of 12.6 trillion karbovantsy, or 21.8 percent of all  expenditures; for defense--2.8 trillion karbovantsy, or 4.9  percent; for administration--3 trillion karbovantsy, or 5.2  percent, and the expenditures associated with the elimination of  the aftereffects of the Chernobyl catastrophe totaled 1.8  trillion karbovantsy, which is 0.7 trillion karbovantsy less  than the payments to this fund.    The deficit of the state budget for 1993 totaled 10.3  trillion karbovantsy, and in December alone it increased by 2.9  trillion karbovantsy, or by 39 percent. Expenditures for the  social protection of the population made up a substantial share  of the expenditures of the state budget--37.4 percent of all  expenditures.    The volumes of credit investments of the banking system in  the national economy for 1 January 1994 totaled 54 trillion  karbovantsy. The emission of money for the year increased by a  factor of 25 and totaled 12.3 trillion karbovantsy.    The monetary incomes of the population totaled 65.7 trillion  karbovantsy. The expenditures of the population totaled 54.2  trillion karbovantsy. The wages of the workers of the state  sector of the economy for last year increased almost by a factor  of 50 and in December 1993 totaled 793,000 karbovantsy, as  compared to 16,000 in the corresponding month of 1992. The  average monthly wage of kolkhoz workers increased for the year  by a factor of 29.5 and totaled 106,000 karbovantsy. The level  of inflation rose significantly in 1993. Prices for consumer  goods and paid services increased by more than a factor of 100.    The labor resources of Ukraine in 1993 totaled more than 29  million persons. A total of 557,500 temporarily unemployed  citizens were registered with the state employment service. For  1993, 11 billion karbovantsy were expended from the population  employment assistance fund for unemployment benefits.    The size of the population of Ukraine on 1 January 1994 was  52.135 million persons, and it decreased in comparison with 1993  by 0.2 percent, or by 109,000 persons.    More than one-fourth of the entire population of Ukraine  consists of pensioners, whose number is increasing every year.  The government has undertaken measures for the social protection  of the population.    The crime-conducive situation has remained difficult. The  number of crimes registered by organs of Internal Affairs  exceeded the level of 1992 by 12 percent and totaled 539,300  cases; every fourth registered crime is grave.    An extremely tense situation, conditioned by a sharp  decrease  in the output of commodities, has developed in the consumer  market. For the year they were produced in the amount of 74  trillion karbovantsy at wholesale factory prices, which is 16.5  percent less than in 1992. In 1993, the quality composition of  the food ration of the population deteriorated. The consumption  of meat and meat products was only 46 kilograms, which is less  in comparison with the previous year by 7 kilograms, milk and  milk products--275 kilograms (less by 10 kilograms), eggs--193  each (less by 34 eggs), fish and fish products--3.2 kilograms  (less by 4.1 kilograms), sunflower oil--8 kilograms (less by 2.6  kilograms), sugar--39 kilograms (6 kilograms less). There was an  increase in the consumption of bakery products, potatoes, fruit,  berries, grapes, vegetables, and melons and gourds.  <H6>  * * * </H6>   Seventy-one stock exchanges were established in the  republic,  and 41 were conducting practical activity. The volumes of  concluded agreements on the exchanges totaled 313 billion  karbovantsy, which is more than in 1992 by a factor of almost  10. The growth was due mainly to high prices for food products,  commodities, and services.    According to preliminary data, the volume of the foreign  trade turnover of Ukraine with countries that were formed on the  territory of the former USSR for 1993 totaled 58.8 trillion  karbovantsy, including exports--20.7 trillion karbovantsy and  imports--38.1 trillion karbovantsy, which resulted in a negative  balance in foreign trade of 17.4 trillion (mainly owing to  payments for natural gas, oil, and oil products), including with  the Russian Federation--12.6 trillion. The Russian Federation  has the biggest share in the foreign trade turnover of Ukraine  with states of the former USSR--75 percent.    In the second half of 1993, the process of destatization of  the property of industrial enterprises accelerated somewhat. The  proportion of enterprises of a nonstate form of property in the  overall number of enterprises increased to 32 percent, as  compared with 25 percent in 1992. These enterprises produced  output for 47 trillion karbovantsy, or 29 percent of the total  volume of products. The process of the destatization of  enterprises in the sphere of services is continuing. The number  of leased enterprises of everyday services of the population is  increasing. The process of privatization of the state housing  fund has started and has picked up considerable speed.</p>

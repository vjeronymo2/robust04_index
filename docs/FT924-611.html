			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Christie's follows rival and lifts charges CHRISTIES International, the fine art auctioneer, has followed its rival Sotheby's in increasing the premium it charges buyers at its sales from 10 to 15 per cent from March 1 1993. The new charge will apply to the first Pounds 30,000 of the hammer price on any lot. Above Pounds 30,000 the 10 per cent rate will continue to be levied. Christie's South Kensington and Christie's Scotland, which between them account for 64 per cent of the lots the group sells in the UK, will retain the 10 per cent charge, as will coin and wine auctions at the main King Street saleroom. The art market is recovering from the recession more slowly than both Sotheby's and Christie's anticipated: hence the need to raise their charges to buyers. At the same time the fierce competition between the two houses for major properties to sell has forced them to reduce the commission they charge important vendors. In 1992 Christie's further closed the gap on market leader Sotheby's. Sotheby's reported year-end sales figures of Dollars 1.13bn (Pounds 674m) yesterday, a rise of 2 per cent in dollar terms and 5.5 per cent in sterling over 1991. Christie's did relatively better. Its annual turnover of Pounds 631m (Dollars 959.1m) represented a 2 per cent im-provement in dollar terms and 8 per cent in sterling. (The auction houses use slightly different currency valuations). It seems the 1991 balance of 52:48 in favour of Sotheby's has changed slightly to 51.5:48.5. Christie's had a better autumn season with sales at Pounds 312m (Dollars 488m), up 17 per cent in sterling but only 4 per cent in dollars following October's devaluation of sterling. In dollar terms Sotheby's autumn figures were down by 3 per cent at Dollars 495.4m, although translated into sterling at Pounds 318m, they were up 10 per cent. Both salerooms have shed staff in the past week. Mr Christopher Davidge, Christie's managing director, reported that since 1990 costs have been cut back by Pounds 32m, or 24 per cent, with 300, or 20 per cent, of the group's jobs going in the same period. The market is improving, but very slowly, with sellers in particular reluctant to offer good objects at auction. Sotheby's reports that it sold 70 works of art for more than Dollars 1m this year as against 51 in 1991. Christie's broke the Dollars 1m barrier 69 times in 1992 compared with 61 in 1991, and 38 times in the autumn season compared with 34 in 1991. For the fourth successive season it sold the most expensive work of art at auction, the Dollars 14.5m (Pounds 9.6m) paid in New York for Harmionie Jaune by Matisse. The salerooms' decision to increase their income from buyers is a gamble. It offers an opportunity for dealers, who are pricing their works of art more competitively, to regain some of the ground they have lost to the auction houses in recent years. Among the smaller London salerooms Phillips saw its turnover fall by 11 per cent in 1992, to Pounds 80.8m and Bonhams had its best year ever, with sales of Pounds 22.5m, a gain of 22 per cent.</p>

			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Yeltsin seeks political peace President Boris Yeltsin sought to avert a breakdown in the fragile calm in Russian politics by asking all parties to sign up to a 'civic accord', published yesterday. However, opposition figures have rejected the president's attempt to get agreement on what he sees as the basic principles of political life. The draft proposes that signatories make no proposals to change the constitution; refrain from seeking pre-term elections at the federal level; desist from stirring passions connected with the failed coups of August 1991 and October 1993, the ringleaders of which have all been freed under an amnesty. Mr Yeltsin is proposing that party and regional leaders, union and enterprise heads, ministers and the president himself sign the document. Mr Gennady Zyuganov, the Communist leader, has already dismissed the draft as unacceptable because of the moratorium on constitutional change. As the draft was published, Mr Yeltsin again cancelled meetings yesterday and on Tuesday, raising fears of a recurrence of the ill health which has kept him from his office five weeks already this year. However, his press spokesman maintained that his health was good. Russia will keep around 30 military bases in former Soviet republics - including one in the Baltic republic of Latvia.</p>

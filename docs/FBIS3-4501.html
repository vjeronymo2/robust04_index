When asked by two KYODO reporters if  she felt Jiang Zemin lacked power, she replied: "If he (Deng  Xiaoping) gives a hand, he will become more powerful."    She added: "To put it more specifically, if he (Deng  Xiaoping) says a word, it may have better results than others."    "Therefore, when necessary, he will appear."    On Deng Xiaoping's southern tour, Xiao Rong said that his  purpose was to help the incumbent leaders implement policies and  principles, because at that time Deng Xiaoping thought he was  experiencing a good opportunity for development. He wanted to  do some leaping [tiao yue yi xia 6426 6460 0001 0007], so he  appeared to help Jiang Zemin et al.    Xiao Rong stressed: Deng Xiaoping is not suffering from any  illness and he has no trouble speaking for a half hour, but  during television appearances his voice is not broadcast.    She continued: Deng Xiaoping does not have a new idea or a  new proposal on the country's reunification. "One country, two  systems" is a major policy. Hong Kong's and Macao's sovereignty  will be recovered in 1997 and 1999 respectively. On the  reunification of the two sides, Xiao Rong said that there is no  time table, but a time table can be worked out at will.    On appraising Mao Zedong, Xiao Rong said: My father does not  agree with the complete negation of Mao Zedong, because he knows  the complete negation of Mao could mean the negation of the  Communist Party's history. Therefore, viewed from the angle of  personal feelings or from the overall political situation, Mao  Zedong should not be completely negated.    Xiao Rong indicated that Deng's family does not agree with  the idea of building a Deng Xiaoping memorial hall.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Pasyakin: "Who Will Become Chairman of </F> the Sevastopol City Council?"]    [Text] Eleven candidates have registered in Sevastopol for  the post of chairman of the City Council. They include Reserve  Admiral Aleksey Kalinin, former commander of the Black Sea  Fleet, Colonel Ivan Yermakov, former mayor of Sevastopol,  Colonel Aleksey Melnikov, deputy head of Black Sea Fleet Air  Force communications, and Rear Admiral Aleksandr Penkin, aide to  the commander of the Black Sea Fleet for work with personnel.    This plethora of military candidates speaks for itself.  Sevastopol is the Black Sea Fleet's main base. It is quite  possible that a Black Sea Fleet serviceman will become head of  the City Council.</p>

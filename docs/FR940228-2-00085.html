			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because the possession-only license and the decommissioning order prohibits operation of FSV, and all spent fuel has been transferred from the reactor, the licensee contended that FSV is outside the ambit of 10 CFR 140.11(a)(4) and that 10 CFR 140.12 applies with its minimum requirement of $4,500,000 for financial protection. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the licensee indicated that it believed that reduced financial protection is warranted and that $50,000,000 in primary financial protection provides adequate coverage for liability stemming from any potential accident. PSC also cited the FSV DP to demonstrate that there were no credible accidents associated with FSV that are comparable, in consequence or severity, to the design basis accidents of an operating facility. PSC concluded that the requested $50,000,000 in primary financial protection insurance coverage is adequate for any fire, accident, or other hazardous event that could credibly occur while decommissioning FSV. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> PSC concluded that the requirement for secondary insurance only applies to plants licensed to operate and is not applicable to FSV. PSC stated that it should not be unfairly burdened with financial liability at another nuclear facility because potential damages from an accident at FSV are reduced to the extent that it could not benefit from the secondary protection. The NRC staff independently evaluated the legal and technical issues associated with the application of the Price-Anderson Act to permanently shutdown reactors in SECY&hyph;93&hyph;127, ``Financial Protection Required of Licensees of Large Nuclear Power Plants During Decommissioning,'' May 10, 1993. In this evaluation, the staff concluded that the NRC has discretionary authority to respond to licensee requests for reduction in the level of primary financial protection and withdrawal from participation in the industry retrospective rating plan. Lastly, the staff concluded that accidents and hazards insured against under Price-Anderson go beyond design basis accidents and beyond those considered ``credible'' as that term is used in 10 CFR part 100 and in interpreting the application of that regulation. The Commission issued a Staff Requirements Memorandum (SRM) based on SECY&hyph;93&hyph;127 on July 13, 1993. In the SRM, the Commission approved the staff's recommendation to permit, through the exemption process, a reduction of primary level coverage to $100,000,000 and a withdrawal from participation in the secondary financial protection layer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the exercise of its discretionary authority, the NRC may, so long as a potential hazard exists at a permanently shutdown reactor, require the full amount of primary financial protection and full participation in the industry retrospective rating plan. At such time that the hazard is determined to no longer exist, the NRC may reduce the amount of primary financial protection and permit the licensee to withdraw from participation in the industry retrospective rating plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the legislative history does not explicitly consider the potential hazards that might exist after termination of operation, the staff generically evaluated the offsite consequences associated with normal and abnormal operations, design basis accidents, and beyond design basis accidents for reactors that have been permanently defueled and shutdown. The staff concluded that, aside from the handling, storage, and transportation of radioactive materials, no reasonably conceivable potential accident exists at FSV that could cause significant offsite damage. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A severe transportation accident could potentially result in local contamination requiring cleanup and offsite liabilities resulting from traffic disruption and loss of use. This type of accident would warrant maintaining some level of liability insurance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The most significant accident sequence for a permanently defueled and shut down reactor with no fuel onsite involves a fire or the dropping of contaminated or activated components during decommissioning operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NRC staff independently evaluated the legal and technical justifications for the exemption presented by PSC. The NRC recognizes that FSV is: (1) Permanently shutdown; (2) defueled; (3) licensed with ``possession only'' status under a decommissioning order and an amended license that does not permit fuel at the reactor facility; and (4) actively being dismantled. The staff concurred with the PSC's evaluation of credible accidents at FSV and their minimal associated offsite consequences. The licensee identified need for continuing liability coverage, $50,000,000, was limited to liability stemming from any fire, accident, or other hazardous events. However, coverage needs associated with transportation of radioactive materials or precautionary evacuations were not identified. Although the licensee presented legal views and opinions regarding the applicability of 10 CFR 140.12 versus 10 CFR 140.11(a)(4), the staff did not concur with these legal views and opinions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The licensee also contended that compliance with existing regulations would result in potential payment of retrospective assessments under the secondary indemnity plan and payments of insurance premiums under the primary financial protection plan. These payments would constitute an ``unfair burden'' to the licensee and its ratepayers. The staff recognizes that relief from financial protection requirements is warranted because the potential hazards and consequences associated with a permanently shut down reactor with no spent fuel are greatly reduced, and that a permanently shut down reactor does not contribute a level of risk to the participants in the secondary pool proportionate to that of an operating reactor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The staff, on its own initiative, did consider liability coverage needs associated with decommissioning activities and transportation of radioactive materials. The results of our evaluation, as embodied in the July 13, 1993, SRM, based on SECY&hyph;93&hyph;127, allow a reduction in the amount of financial protection required of licensees of large nuclear plants that have been prematurely shut down. FSV meets the criterion established in SECY&hyph;93&hyph;127 for relief from financial protection requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the licensee requested a new primary financial protection coverage level of $50,000,000, the staff has also concluded that claims settlement experience at the Three Mile Island Unit 2 (TMI&hyph;2) (an accident which did not result in a significant release of radioactivity) provides a reasonable basis for establishing the appropriate level of primary insurance coverage. Because TMI&hyph;2 claims have reached $60,000,000 and a large number of TMI&hyph;2 claims are still unsettled, the staff concluded that a level of $100,000,000 for primary financial protection coverage is warranted. This level of primary insurance coverage is consistent with the SRM dated July 13, 1993. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Tunnel damage almost repaired Damage caused by an explosion in the Channel tunnel should be repaired by tomorrow, the Health and Safety Executive said yesterday. TML, the contractor, said the incident occurred during tests 7km from the UK end of the tunnel, where it was still under land, on November 13. It was not made public until yesterday. Eurotunnel, the operating company, dismissed fears that the start of services through the Channel tunnel might be delayed by the accident, which is reported to have happened when 25,000 volts were sent down the main power cable and hit an abandoned metal bar. An HSE official said the incident had happened during testing of the system which took electric power to equipment which carried overhead cables through the tunnel. TML, the contractor, said the area had been cleared, as part of standard safety procedures, and no one was hurt.</p>

The initial microstructure  consists mostly of _a_-Al, Al[.sub]6[/]Fe particles and a  smaller volume fraction of an amorphous phase. During annealing,  the amorphous phase transforms into _a_[.sub]T[/]-AlFeSi  phase, the globular particles of Al[.sub]6[/]Fe growth up and  some needle-like Al[.sub]3[/]Fe phase precipitates near the  _a_-Al grain boundaries. At 673 K, 96 h and 773 K, 5 h  annealing, the Ti and C dissolved in the _a_-Al during rapid  solidification precipitates as a compound phase of  TiC[.sub]0.79[/]. The formation process of TiC phase is  discussed.</p>

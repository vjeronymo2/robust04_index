			<p><P> January 4, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BROKERAGE BUYS CONTROL OF IRVINE'S CYCLE INDUSTRIES;  </P> <P> MERRILL LYNCH TURNS BULLISH ON SURFWEAR  </P> <P> Merrill Lynch is hitting the surf.  </P> <P> The big brokerage house with the button-down image has become majority owner of  an Irvine company that owns Off Shore Sportswear, a surfwear manufacturer, and  holds licenses to produce Hobie T-shirts and Catchit T-shirts.  </P> <P> Merrill Lynch Pierce Fenner &amp; Smith bought the interest in Cycle Industries  -- and its surfwear labels -- several weeks ago from Steve MacBaisey, Cycle's  founder. MacBaisey, Cycle employees and Ex-Sto Capital, an investment banking  house, also own interests in Cycle, MacBaisey said Tuesday.  </P> <P> MacBaisey on Tuesday confirmed reports of the sale, which was completed in  November, but declined to reveal financial details. Merrill Lynch officials  could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> MacBaisey will continue to run the company as chairman, chief executive and  president under a 4-year management contract.  </P> <P> Merrill Lynch's entree into surfwear marks the second major shake-up recently  in the volatile industry, which has hit rough waters in the last 2 years.  </P> <P> Catchit -- a Tustin-based manufacturer of surf trunks, board shorts and a  women's line called Haute Rush -- was sold Dec. 22 for an undisclosed sum by  Pacific Trail of Seattle to its founder and president, Ian Forman, and two  other investors. The company has been in a slump for more than a year.  </P> <P> Catchit owns the rights to its T-shirt line and now will collect royalties from  its sub-licensees, including Merrill Lynch.  </P> <P> The changes are seen as more evidence of a financial wipeout within the  $1-billion-a-year surfwear business.  </P> <P> "There's been an oversaturation of the beach look in the marketplace, and it's  a cyclical industry," said Glenn Mounger, president of the Mounger Corp. in  Seattle, parent company of Pacific Trail. "When everybody jumps on a product,  the uniqueness isn't there. The consumer got tired of it."  </P> <P> Forman, the Catchit founder, acknowledged that the firm's sales were "flat"  last year and that the company lost money.  </P> <P> Burbank-based Hobie Apparel -- which licenses its entire line, including  T-shirts -- has retail sales of about $120 million and is doing well --  particularly in such chains as Mervyn's and J.C. Penney, industry observers  said.  </P> <P> Both Off Shore and Catchit have suffered among surfwear retailers in the last 2  years, according to some industry insiders.  </P> <P> "Off Shore and Catchit mean nothing -- they've been gone for years," said Paul  Heussenstamm, owner of Newport Surf &amp; Sport in Newport Beach, a leading  retailer and industry trend-setter. "Two years ago, I used to buy a ton from  Catchit. But their line got real bad -- bad design, bad quality, poor taste."  </P> <P> To revive the lines, Merrill Lynch and MacBaisey will have to increase sales of  the labels to such major retail outlets as Walmart, Sears and J.C. Penney,  Heussenstamm said.  </P> <P> While he declined to discuss strategy, MacBaisey predicted that Cycle  Industries' sales will climb 25% in 1989.  </P> <P> Cycle was founded as a silk-screening company by MacBaisey about 10 years ago.  Today, about 65% of its business is silk-screening of clothing made by others,  MacBaisey said, while the remaining 35% is manufacturing, including the Off  Shore line of surfwear.  </P> <P> Industry sources estimated Cycle's retail revenue at $30 million to $40 million  annually.  </P> <P> According to MacBaisey, Cycle is "probably the most profitable garment  manufacturer in California."  </P></p>

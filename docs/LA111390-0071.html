Garbo's paintings go on sale today and Wednesday, and her furniture, including  a Louis XV chair with a rip in its salmon upholstery, is to be sold Thursday.  </P> <P> The Garbo collection will remain on view at the auction house next to the Henry  Ford II collection of Impressionist paintings, department store king Jerome  Ohrbach's collection of Monets and Matisses and paintings that belonged to the  late violinist Jascha Heifetz. More than 7,000 visitors have viewed the Garbo  exhibit since its opening Friday. CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Prague to construct oil pipeline from Germany THE Czech government has approved the construction of an oil pipeline between Germany and the Czech republic which will diversify Czechoslovakia's near total dependency on oil supplies from the ex-Soviet Union in the future, writes Ariane Genillard in Prague. The pipeline will join two oil refineries in the Czech republic with an oil terminal in Ingolstadt, Germany, which is linked with the Mediterranean port of Trieste. The Czech government said it will encourage local banks to invest in the building of the 320km-long pipeline. It will also seek international financing for the project which is expected to cost up to DM450m (Pounds 156.7m), according to Mr Victor Jakoubek, adviser at the federal Ministry of Economics.</p>

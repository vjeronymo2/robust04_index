			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Leonid Vinogradov] </F>   [Text] Vladivostok, 19 Apr (TASS] -- The liquid  radioactive waste from Russian Pacific Fleet submarines may be  dumped in the Sea of Japan, because it can't be disposed of  otherwise at present. Tankers, anchored at the moorings of  "Zvezda" works, are filled up to the rim with the waste and  cannot take new deliveries of the dangerous shipment. This was  stated today to an ITAR-TASS correspondent by Vladimir  Ignatenko, the Russian presidential representative in the  Maritime Kray.    He said that the government should have allocated funds for  building a waste processing installation. However, not a single  ruble has been earmarked for this purpose as yet. In the  meantime, one tanker with 794 tonnes of waste on board urgently  needs repairing. So, one should either stop the works, in order  to [word indistinct] the already critical mass of the  radioactive liquid accumulated here, or dump the liquid in the  sea. But this can't happen unless agreed by the Russian  president, Vladimir Ignatenko said.</p>

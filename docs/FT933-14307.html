			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Credit details costly CONFIDENTIAL computer data do not come cheap. The Financial Times yesterday anonymously rang three detective agencies to ask prices for details of individual bank records and credit card details - information the Data Protection Act requires banks to keep confidential. At one, the top rate was Pounds 500 plus VAT for account and credit card details. At the second, a simple search into a current account cost Pounds 250-Pounds 300 so long as the account-holder's name, address, and account numbers were provided. The third, registered with the National Association of Private Investigators, charged Pounds 300 plus VAT and needed a fortnight to deliver. Mr John Lamidey, assistant data protection registrar, said private tracing agents bribe staff to obtain data or internal codes used to authenticate inquiries. He said they place small advertisements in evening papers inviting staff of utilities or financial services companies to make extra money. Mr Geoffrey Cooke, deputy director of the British Bankers Association, said: 'It's not a matter of hacking. Dishonesty and duplicity is involved.' The banks have some way to go. Mr Lamidey said only two out of 10 banks he has visited - Abbey National and TSB - will not disclose any account details over the telephone. Barclays Bank insists its safeguards against unauthorised disclosure are sufficient. Requests for account details come from other branches or customers. A Barclays employee has to quote a password which is changed up to three times a day. Even then, information is not given out immediately. If a call comes from a customer, the bank will disclose information only if the caller's identify can be verified.</p>

			<p><P> July 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CUBA AGAIN ATTACKS U.S. ON DRUG INFORMATION  </P> <P> Preoccupied with its worst scandal in 30 years, Cuba on Tuesday again accused  the United States of not sharing information that might have earlier exposed  the Cuban military and intelligence officers who were executed or imprisoned  after a court-martial found them guilty of drug trafficking.  </P> <P> The Cuban complaint contradicted diplomatic reports in Havana that American  officials on at least six occasions this year brought information about Cuban  drug trafficking to the attention of Cuba's Foreign Ministry. The informal  American protests were made both before and during the two-month Cuban  investigation that exposed the country's top military hero and a covey of  government officials as drug traffickers, the diplomatic sources said.  </P> <P> But Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ricardo Alarcon, at a news conference  said: "It is absolutely false that U.S. authorities have given any type of  information whatsoever to Cuban authorities. . . . We received no information  whatsoever prior to the arrest of these persons, nor any information after they  were arrested."  </P> <P> Cuban army Maj. Gen. Arnaldo Ochoa Sanchez and three lesser-ranking officers  were shot by firing squad July 13, and 10 other officers of the army and the  Interior Ministry's intelligence branch were sentenced to lengthy prison terms.  </P> <P> According to testimony in their court-martial, a major part of the  drug-trafficking plot was uncovered only in the course of an investigation of  suspected sex escapades and black-marketeering while Ochoa was head of the  Cuban military mission in Angola.  </P> <P> His connection, along with the Interior Ministry officials, to the drug trade  came as an bombshell to the Cuban leadership, according to explanations in  speeches by President Fidel Castro and his brother, Defense Minister Raul  Castro. In one of the speeches, on July 9, Castro accused the United States of  not warning him that Cuban officers were trafficking in cocaine.  </P> <P> Repeating Castro's charge, Alarcon complained that even though he personally  asked a high-ranking State Department official last January to provide  information concerning drug traffic through Cuba, "until this moment no  information has been provided."  </P> <P> But the diplomatic sources here insisted that American diplomats in Havana  repeatedly informed Alarcon and other officials of what was taking place in  Cuban airspace and territorial waters, where U.S. anti-drug officials say they  had tracked more than 60 suspected drug flights since early 1988. Whether the  Americans actually passed along the names of some of the Cuban officers  believed to be involved was unclear.  </P> <P> "The representations were not a casual thing," one diplomat said about the U.S.  efforts to inform the Castro government. "It was understood that this was very  serious and they ought to look into it."  </P> <P> In a scolding tone, Alarcon repeated Castro's earlier request for "some form of  communication between Cuba and the United States in this common battle."  </P> <P> According to the diplomatic sources, the earlier U.S. representations were  "shrugged off" by the Cubans. This seeming indifference led to an assumption by  American officials that the drug smuggling had been approved at the highest  level in Havana, perhaps by Raul Castro or even Fidel Castro himself, the  diplomatic sources said.  </P> <P> However, most European and Latin American diplomats interviewed this week say  they now believe the Castro brothers were genuinely shocked by the revelations  and had no previous knowledge of the heavy drug traffic across Cuba.  </P></p>

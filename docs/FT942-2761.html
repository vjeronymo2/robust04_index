			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Porter Chadburn loss at Pounds 17m Provisions related to its withdrawal from the unprofitable consumer products division pushed pre-tax losses up sharply at Porter Chadburn in the year to April 1. On sales of Pounds 133m (Pounds 138m), including Pounds 78.9m (Pounds 70.5m) from continuing operations, the packaging and specialist distribution group reported a deficit of Pounds 17.2m (Pounds 3.62m). Mr Pat Barrett, chairman, said the withdrawal from the unprofitable division was complete. The remaining activities were all profitable and generating cash. The operating loss was Pounds 1.22m (Pounds 4.34m). Exceptional charges of Pounds 14.6m included Pounds 8m of goodwill written back to comply with new accounting standards. Bank borrowings at the year end were Pounds 9.1m (Pounds 10.9m) and the company said they had fallen further in the wake of the disposals. However, shareholders' funds had declined to Pounds 9.5m (Pounds 19.5m) due to the high losses and repayment of the preference shares in December and also the provisions. In the current year Pounds 2.3m is due in connection with deferred acquisition payments. Losses per share grew to 17.48p (4.82p) and there is no final dividend. Last year there was a 0.4p final out of a total of 1.25p. Mr Barrett said the American label business had started the year well and in the UK the specialist distribution division had made a satisfactory start.</p>

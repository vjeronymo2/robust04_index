			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Pakistan (9): Privatisation flagship - Case study / Pakistan Telecommunications - As the country celebrates this year's first public offer of shares in the Pakistan Telecommunications Corporation (PTC), no one can be entirely certain of the company's future The government claims that the offer of PTC shares is a huge success. But some analysts regard it as a grave setback - possibly one which has left the PTC's reputation in tatters. At the root of the controversy lies the claim that clients were provided with misleading information about the scale of the company's operations and the number of lines in use before 6m shares, representing 12 per cent of PTC, were placed on the markets in Pakistan and abroad this year. This included 1m shares, sold through vouchers of 100 shares each, in Pakistan. After a strong show of public interest in that effort, the government abruptly changed the initial terms and decided to keep all the subscription money. But that triggered protests from brokers and investors, many of whom expected to make windfall profits of up to 160 per cent, based on projections for future price rises. At the same time, some bankers also expressed concern over the government's last-minute decision to cancel an agreement with Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) for a subsequent placement of 5m shares in international markets. The cancellation came in response to protests from investors, many of whom claimed that the price for the international placement was undervalued and would then force down the market value of shares already sold in Pakistan. In the light of that criticism, a contract for the placement of the 5m shares was given to Jardine Fleming. That placement brought in approximately Dollars 900m, as opposed to an earlier estimate of Dollars 500m. This gave Pakistan an opportunity to claim that it was right in changing the terms of the sale. But that view has hardly helped to save the company's face, especially in view of the subsequent troubles over the disclosure of information. In less than three months, share prices have fallen by over 20 per cent, due to the uncertainty. Among other troubles, a delay in the declaration of the results for the fiscal year ending this June has also intensified anxieties among investors. Despite these difficulties, the government continues to insist that its plans remain on track. Some officials claim that problems such as the delay in the results have occurred because the government is carrying out detailed assessment of the company's assets, so that future investors are provided full information. 'We want to give confidence to the investor that the telecommunication sector will not be part of the whim and fancy of a state, but that anybody who comes within the framework (of the new terms) will know very clearly what his rights and what his obligations are,' explains Mr Shahid Aziz Siddiqui, a senior official in the government's communications ministry and a member of the PTC's board of directors. According to Mr Siddiqui, the company's new management will have exclusive rights to the market for up to seven years, so that it has a certain degree of security. The government plans to start inviting offers by the end of next summer from 'strategic investors' - a term used to describe large telephone companies or business groups which are willing to buy at least 26 per cent of the shares and take over the management. If there are no further delays, the new management may step in by early 1996. Some officials expect strong international competition, based on the different companies which have made inquiries. According to one official involved in the preparation of the privatisation plan, these have included AT&amp;T, Australian Telecom, Singapore Telecom, Alcatel and Cable &amp; Wireless. In addition to inviting these offers, it is planned that a new company shall be set up, called the National Telecommunications Corporation (NTC), to provide service to the defence forces and government offices. This is in response to concern that private ownership, especially foreign, taking over the telephone company would create new security risks for the country. These concerns have delayed privatisation efforts for almost three years. Some businessmen are worried that Islamabad risks alienating international investors if there are any further delays. 'The more the delay, the greater the possibility that companies looking at PTC will look elsewhere,' cautions Mr Farooq Hasan, chairman of Paktel, Pakistan's largest mobile telephone company, a joint venture with Britain's Cable &amp; Wireless as the lead foreign partner. 'Nowadays, there are other countries which are trying to privatise the telephone business, too,' he adds. However, Mr Hasan concedes that the government faces a dilemma, because of all the work that needs to be done, such as the provision of full financial details and preparation of the latest company results - 'they face a dilemma too, the PTC cannot be given when it is only half-cooked,' he says.</p>

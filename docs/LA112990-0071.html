			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NBA ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> PISTONS GO TO EDWARDS FOR NINTH IN A ROW  </P> <P> The Detroit Pistons are so talented and well-balanced that the same player  rarely leads them in scoring two games in a row.  </P> <P> They have developed a knack for finding one or more hot shooters whenever they  are needed.  </P> <P> What does stay constant, though, is the defense.  </P> <P> The two-time NBA champions ran their winning streak to nine games and improved  their record to 12-2 Wednesday night at Auburn Hills, Mich., with a 90-83  victory over the New York Knicks.  </P> <P> It was James Edwards' turn to lead the scoring. The veteran power forward had  22 points and sank a couple of key baskets down the stretch.  </P> <P> As usual, the defense took control. The slumping Knicks, who have lost four in  a row, played the Pistons to a 52-52 standstill at halftime. But in the second  half the Knicks scored only 31 points and, despite a Detroit cold spell in the  fourth quarter, never really had a chance.  </P> <P> The Pistons led, 77-66, going into the final 12 minutes but failed to get a  point in seven consecutive trips down the court. Their tough defense, however,  let the Knicks get no closer than six points despite the Pistons' 13-point  fourth quarter.  </P> <P> "It's a good thing we played great defense in the second half," Coach Chuck  Daly said, "because we couldn't get any shots. We had six 24-second violations,  which shows you just how good their defense was."  </P> <P> Edwards was expecting a good night. "Charles Oakley is a fine player, but at  6-9, he's too short," the seven-footer said. "I can go over the top of him."  </P> <P> Miami 97, New Jersey 79 -- Maybe winning three games in a row made the Nets  overconfident. Whatever, they didn't come to Miami ready to play.  </P> <P> They shot a season-low 36% from the field but still trailed by only four points  until late in the third period when Heat rookie Willie Burton triggered a 9-0  run that broke it open.  </P> <P> Golden State 110, Cleveland 108 -- The Warriors are a much better team with  Mitch Richmond.  </P> <P> In his second game back from a sprained ankle, Richmond scored 24 points and  made a key rebound in the closing seconds at Richfield, Ohio, to end the  Warriors' three-game losing streak.  </P> <P> Tim Hardaway had 23 points and 17 assists for the Warriors.  </P> <P> Chicago 118, Washington 94 -- Michael Jordan started out at Chicago as if he  were on his way to one of his 50-point games. He had 15 points in the first  quarter.  </P> <P> But high-scoring games are not that important to the Bulls' star these days.  With the Bulls building a 39-26 lead, Jordan spent most of the rest of the game  on the bench.  </P> <P> Jordan, 11 of 15 from the field, finished with 24 points in just 27 minutes.  All 12 Bulls scored as they romped to their third victory in a row.  </P> <P> Charlotte 118, Milwaukee 111 -- The Hornets never led during regulation at  Charlotte, but behind J.R. Reid and Rex Chapman, went wild in overtime, scoring  16 points. It was their first victory over the Bucks.  </P> <P> Armon Gilliam, after missing four games because of tendinitis, scored 20 points  and had 11 rebounds.  </P> <P> The Bucks led most of the night and had a four-point lead with 35 seconds left  in regulation. But Muggsy Bogues hit an 18-foot jumper and followed with two  free throws. Ricky Pierce, who scored 28 points, gave the Bucks the lead back  with a short jumper, but Chapman sent it into overtime with a jumper with four  seconds left.  </P> <P> Philadelphia 116, Indiana 106 -- Charles Barkley had 33 points, 12 rebounds and  five assists at Philadelphia to lead the 76ers.  </P> <P> Utah 103, Houston 92 -- Karl Malone scored 31 points at Salt Lake City and the  Jazz held Akeem Olajuwon to 19 and won their fourth in a row.

			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Observer: Embattled Kate Kate Adie, BBC TV's star foreign reporter, has just discovered another trouble spot - the leafy suburbs of Brussels. Adie was supposed to be guest of honour at a prestigious luncheon in the Belgian capital on Tuesday, marking International Women's Day. However, she failed to show up. The excuse - pressure of business in Sarajevo - didn't go down well with ambassadorial wives and other female high-flyers who had been keen to hear the latest from the front line.</p>

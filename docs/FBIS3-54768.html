In an interview with the Russian  media, he announced that over the last year prices had gone up  nine-fold. Let me remind you, in 1992 they went up by 26 times.  Moreover, they are quickly approaching world prices at present  and this means the end of prosperity for low-effective  enterprises. Boris Fedorov noted as a positive element the fact  that it proved possible in 1993 to stop a flow of unjustified  subsidies and credits to CIS countries. At the same time, the  interest rates were considerably increased and privileges for  non-effective enterprises reduced. This has led to an improved  protection of the savings of the population and enterprises  against inflation.</p>

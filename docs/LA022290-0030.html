			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: BEVERLY HILLS;  </P> <P> RESOLUTION ON MALATHION  </P> <P> With all five members indicating support, the City Council has instructed its  legal staff to draw up a resolution calling for a halt to all malathion  spraying until authorities can answer questions concerning possible health  risks.  </P> <P> "Agricultural interests are important, but cannot supersede the interests of  human health," said Councilwoman Vicki Reynolds.  </P> <P> Councilman Robert Tanenbaum agreed. "There are too many unknown potential  health hazards," he said.  </P> <P> Malathion, an insecticide, is being sprayed in parts of Los Angeles County by  the state Food and Agriculture Department in an effort to eradicate an  infestation of Mediterranean fruit flies. So far, Beverly Hills has been  outside the spraying zone, although some parts of the city were sprayed during  a 1984 infestation.  </P> <P> Once the resolution is passed, it will be sent to the Los Angeles County Board  of Supervisors and the California Legislature.  </P></p>

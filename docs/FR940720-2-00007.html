In accordance with section 732(b) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act) and 19 CFR 353.12 (1994), the petitioner alleges that small diameter circular seamless carbon and alloy steel standard, line and pressure pipe (seamless pipe) from Argentina, Brazil, Germany and Italy is being, or is likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value within the meaning of section 731 of the Act, and that these imports are materially injuring, or threaten material injury to, a U.S. industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitioner has stated that it has standing to file the petitions because it is an interested party, as defined under section 771(9)(C) of the Act, and because the petitions were filed on behalf of the U.S. industry producing the product subject to these investigations. If any interested party, as described under paragraphs (C), (D), (E), or (F) of section 771(9) of the Act, wishes to register support for, or opposition to, these petitions, it should file a written notification with the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Scope of Investigations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For purposes of these investigations, seamless pipes are seamless carbon and alloy (other than stainless) steel pipes, of circular cross-section, not more than 114.3mm (4.5 inches) in outside diameter, regardless of wall thickness, manufacturing process (hot-finished or cold-drawn), end finish (plain end, bevelled end, upset end, threaded, or threaded and coupled), or surface finish. These pipes are commonly known as standard pipe, line pipe or pressure pipe, depending upon the application. They may also be used in structural applications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The seamless pipes subject to these investigations are currently classifiable under subheadings 7304.10.10.20, 7304.10.50.20, 7304.31.60.50, 7304.39.00.16, 7304.39.00.20, 7304.39.00.24, 7304.39.00.28, 7304.39.00.32, 7304.51.50.05, 7304.51.50.60, 7304.59.60.00, 7304.59.80.10, 7304.59.80.15, 7304.59.80.20, and 7304.59.80.25 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following information further defines the scope of these investigations, which covers pipes meeting the physical parameters described above:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specifications, Characteristics and Uses: Seamless pressure pipes are intended for the conveyance of water, steam, petrochemicals, chemicals, oil products, natural gas and other liquids and gasses in industrial piping systems. They may carry these substances at elevated pressures and temperatures and may be subject to the application of external heat. Seamless carbon steel pressure pipe meeting the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standard A&hyph;106 may be used in temperatures of up to 1000 degrees fahrenheit, at various American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) code stress levels. Alloy pipes made to ASTM standard A&hyph;335 must be used if temperatures and stress levels exceed those allowed for A&hyph;106 and the ASME codes. Seamless pressure pipes sold in the United States are commonly produced to the ASTM A&hyph;106 standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Seamless standard pipes are most commonly produced to the ASTM A&hyph;53 specification and generally are not intended for high temperature service. They are intended for the low temperature and pressure conveyance of water, steam, natural gas, air and other liquids and gasses in plumbing and heating systems, air conditioning units, automatic sprinkler systems, and other related uses. Standard pipes (depending on type and code) may carry liquids at elevated temperatures but must not exceed relevant ASME code requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

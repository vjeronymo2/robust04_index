			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Upbeat PM hails 'new prosperity' THE prime minister believes Britain can still achieve 'new success and prosperity' in the 1990s despite the 'severe difficulties and tough choices' experienced recently. In a foreword to a new 48-page pamphlet setting out the government's record in the 1990s, Mr John Major looks forward to a change in the fortunes of the government and the nation yesterday. A revealing comment by Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, leaves little doubt about the despondency he and the prime minister encountered last month during their visits to various provincial centres to meet Conservative activists. Sir Norman said it was made clear to them that 'there was a need for a clear account of the government's many positive achievements'. The prime minister underlined the need to build a recovery creating jobs, and renewed opportunities for ownership of homes, shares, pensions and wealth. He also accepted that there should be wider choice in education, health, housing and transport - 'because more choice means higher standards'. The pamphlet, which according to Sir Norman 'conveys a clear impression' of where the prime minister intends to lead Britain, reaffirms the commitment to further income tax cuts. It states: 'The government will continue to move towards a 20p basic rate of income tax for all, when resources allow.' Acknowledging the political sensitivity of law and order issues, the pamphlet states 'new reforms will strengthen the partnership between the police and public still further. 'Forthcoming legislation in the new parliamentary session will focus the police's work more closely on tackling crime and will improve local accountability.'

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mustafa 'Abd-al-'Aziz: "250,000 Suspects in </F> Bribery and Embezzlement Lineup"]    [Text] Last year competent agencies investigated 56,000  bribery and 1,400 embezzlement cases. If only a quarter of these  crimes are usually reported, this means that every year there  are more than 250,000 people who take bribes and embezzle.    This dangerous phenomenon has recently spread, with the  number of bribe-takers and embezzlers growing daily. And it is  not stopping: every day one finds several stories about bribery  or embezzlement in the newspapers. The number is frightening and  terrifying, and we do not know how big it will be in a few  years. Why has the phenomenon spread? How can it be stopped, so  that the hemorrhaging of public money stops and government  employees regain their senses, their values, the teachings of  their religion, and their loyalty to their country?    There are so many examples that it is difficult to count and  list them. They begin with a minor government employee who asks  for a few pounds as a bribe; they end with a powerful and  influential senior government employee who also asks for a bribe  and exploits his power to get it. It is the same with  embezzlement. It begins with a simple factory worker who  embezzles a small amount of money; it ends with major embezzlers  who embezzle thousands and millions.    As just one example, none of us can forget the "big fish" of  Nasr City and what he did with a large number of weak-spirited  government employees, who wronged innocents, broke the laws, and  wasted millions of pounds of these people's money. After him  came "the little fish" (in comparison with the size of the big  fish's misdeeds), and they also cost the people of Egypt  millions in losses through bribery and embezzlement.    A few days ago, the newspapers published two embezzlement  stories on a single page.    The first was "the arrest of the administrative head of  Central al-Jizah District on a charge of bribery and misuse of  influence."    The second story was "a bank employee squanders 1.25 million  pounds." When will the phenomenon end?    Who will stop the hemorrhaging of public money. Who will  prevent the loss of millions and of values and principles? Who?    Bribery has become endemic in government agencies in our  country. It is a phenomenon that constitutes a chronic  disease--thus states the lawyer Ahmad 'Awdah. He adds: "It is an  intractable disease, a malady that spreads and worsens every  day. The situation now pleases no one. Those in need or  requesting a service--the interested parties--get no results  without somehow paying a bribe to 'Zayd or 'Amr.' There is no  longer any business done anywhere without bribery or at least  favoritism or influence peddling. In all cases the Egyptian  citizen is the victim. Having admitted the existence of this  sickness and vicious malady, legislation has not succeeded in  eliminating it. In the past, bribery was a misdemeanor. Now it  has become a felony with a deterrent punishment. Yet despite the  increased penalty, the unfortunate phenomenon is becoming more  and more common and the disease unfortunately is spreading.  Toughening or increasing the penalty won't accomplish anything.  Watching and oversight have accomplished nothing, because the  watchdog or oversight agencies cannot hire a guard or policeman  to stand next to every employee. What one can say is that the  source of the problem is lack of integrity, ethical corruption,  collapse of social values, and a weak religious conscience.  Moreover, complaints against a government employee receive no  attention. Complaints no longer avail because the official's  superior does not side with the aggrieved citizen, but flatters  the employee at the expense of the truth. In the end the citizen  finds himself forced to pay."    As for crimes of embezzlement, Ahmad 'Awdah points out that  they are a betrayal of trust by an employee who is in charge of  a public work or holds a deposit of money or goods in trust.  "The betrayal in this case is considered a crime in the eyes of  the law. Its punishment in government agencies is that of a  felony. In nongovernment agencies it is a misdemeanor.  Nevertheless, increasing the punishment will not succeed.  Instead, we need to awaken the conscience, which in some people  has died, in others has gone to sleep, and in yet others has  become shaky. Can we awaken consciences and again stimulate the  religious sense, the fear of God, and awareness of God's  oversight in matters private and public? I hope so, though I  think it will be hard to accomplish."    Chief appeals court judge Khalifah al-Juyushi says: "Section  103 of the Penal Code stipulates that any public employee who  asks for himself or another, or who accepts or takes a promise  or the offer of a gift for the performance of any part of his  duty, shall be considered to have taken a bribe and shall be  punished by hard labor for life and a fine not under 1,000  pounds or over the amount he was given or promised. The criminal  law concerning this item is not in need of change. The causes of  bribery can be traced basically to weakness of the religious  conscience, as well as the country's economic crisis and  inflation. The bribe-taker is someone psychologically prepared  to do so. The government needs to hold training courses for  employees before they take up their duties. The information  media has a large role to play in the phenomenon--television,  radio, and newspapers. In this way, public employees will be  ready to carry out the responsibilities of their positions. An  attempt also must be made to solve our economic problems,  especially unemployment."    As for the law and punishment for bribery, they are quite  sufficient and do not need to be increased or made more  stringent. Section 102 of the Penal Code stipulates that any  public employee who embezzles funds, papers, or anything else  found in his possession by virtue of his position shall be  punished by a term at hard labor. The punishment is hard labor  for life in the following cases:    1. If the offending official is a local tax collector, his  representative, a trustee for deposits, or a cashier who has  been entrusted with money in that capacity.    2. If the crime of embezzlement is intrinsically connected  to  the crime of falsification or using a falsified document.    3. If the crime is committed in wartime and entails damage  to  the country's economic position or national interest.    In my opinion, the problem is deficient religious  conscience,  as well as the grinding economic crisis. Also, there are the  offender's own tendencies or psychological disposition before he  commits the crime of bribery or embezzlement.    Major General Faruq Hafiz, director of the department that  investigates the implementation of sentences, says: "This  problem and these figures do not constitute a phenomenon and  should not disturb us. This is because the number of people who  accept bribes or embezzle is insignificant in comparison with  the population--about four per thousand. Human beings have  produced crime since Cain and Abel. It diminishes or increases  depending on apprehension and combat. Embezzlers have existed in  every age and time at home and abroad. If there really is any  phenomenon, it is the increased apprehension of crimes. This is  a healthy phenomenon in the fight and a sure sign that the  agencies are combatting crime. Moreover, crime is connected to  social factors. The social factors in turn are connected to the  conscience and an ethical revival. Embezzling is not related to  the question of riches and poverty. A rich man is one who is  rich in spirit, not rich in money. The large number of  apprehensions should be credited to the government's oversight  and regulatory agencies, which have indeed engaged in  apprehension." Major General Faruq Hafiz added: "The crime of  accepting bribes or embezzling has its causes. Sometimes it is  the citizen who pays the government employee and presents  bribery or embezzlement to him in a favorable light. We must not  forget to emphasize that values have changed with the passage of  time. Crime in all its forms will surely continue as long as  there are human beings. The important thing is to fight it.  Thank God the fight is going on and is strong!"    Assistant interior minister Major General 'Adil al-Nahhas  emphasizes that these numbers do not constitute a significant  phenomenon compared to the population. It is an individual  phenomenon involving certain weak-spirited employees. One cannot  generalize from them to the great majority of honest government  employees. We hear and read about the exceptions. There are  employees who hold sensitive leadership posts, and we have heard  nothing to cast opprobrium on them. Cases of embezzlement occur  not only in Egypt; individual cases of corruption come to light  in all countries of the world.</p>

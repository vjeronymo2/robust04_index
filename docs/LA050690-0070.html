			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OVERDONE PREVIEWS  </P> <P> Are we the only ones who resent the 20-minute movie previews we are shown in  movie theaters? These previews reveal the entire plot, and they show all the  major action and events. We end up feeling like we already saw the movie.  Previews should entice viewers, not tell the entire story!  </P> <P> DIRK and ERIK SANDERS  </P> <P> Woodland Hills  </P></p>

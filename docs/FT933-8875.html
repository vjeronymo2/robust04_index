			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Canadians dig in on Nafta sanctions - Negotiations on pact's labour and environment side-deals reach 'bit of an impasse' CANADA'S business community yesterday threw its support behind the Ottawa government's refusal to include trade sanctions in the side-deals on labour and the environment being negotiated as part of the North American free trade agreement. Disagreement between the US and Mexico on one hand, and Canada on the other, over the enforcement of labour and environmental standards has thrown a wrench into the protracted negotiations on the side-deals. Officials had hoped that the three countries' trade ministers would meet in Ottawa today to finalise them. Ms Kim Campbell, Canada's prime minister, said yesterday that 'we have a bit of an impasse with our partners in the negotiations. . . . There may be a compromise that can be worked out that could resolve the issue.' Ms Campbell is expected to discuss the sanctions issue by phone in the next few days with President Bill Clinton and Mexico's President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. Conclusion of the negotiations is seen largely as a matter of political will. The Clinton administration has promised to conclude the two side-deals before submitting Nafta to Congress for ratification. It has also insisted that trade remedies, such as the reintroduction of customs duties, be included as a penalty against violators of environmental and labour standards. The US and Mexico are understood to have agreed on a dispute-settlement formula which would include various types of sanctions, but with trade remedies as a last resort. Mr Thomas d'Aquino, president of the Business Council on National Issues, which represents the chief executives of Canada's 150 biggest companies, said yesterday: 'We very strongly applaud the position which the federal government has taken.' Damian Fraser adds from Mexico City: While Mexico may have already agreed to accept trade sanctions for non-compliance with environmental laws as part of the side-deals, it has firmly rejected apparent US and Canadian pressure for the right to be able to sue Mexico in Mexican courts. Sanctions would only occur in the last resort, would be extremely rare, and would involve tariffs on certain goods returning to their pre-Nafta level, according to a report in El Financiero newspaper. A Mexican official said that 'there are very few points' that divide the three countries, but it was 'not over until it's over'. He suggested the main problem was a lack of political will in Canada to reach an agreement, given the concern with its forthcoming general election. The official confirmed the veracity of a cable obtained by Reuter and sent out on Wednesday which suggested that Mexico would break off side negotiations on Nafta if the US and Canada demanded the right to sue Mexico in its own courts, presumably for not enforcing its environment and labour laws. The cable was sent to Mexican negotiators in Washington from the Trade Ministry. It said that 'the pretension of the US and Canada to include the possibility of suing Mexico in its own courts attacks the concept of sovereignty and is as such inadmissible. It is in fact a breaking point.' Suing the Mexican government in Mexico would almost certainly be futile, since the courts would be highly unlikely to rule against their own government in favour of the US even if able to.</p>

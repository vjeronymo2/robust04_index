			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / International Company News: Arco blames tight margins for decline ATLANTIC Richfield (Arco), the Los Angeles-based energy group, reported a fall in second-quarter net income to Dollars 271m, or Dollars 1.67 a share, from Dollars 309m, or Dollars 1.91, a year ago. It blamed pressure on margins in its downstream oil and gas business and chemicals. The figures include a net credit of Dollars 48m reflecting gains from the sale of oil and gas properties, compared with a Dollars 65m special credit in the 1992 quarter. Refining, marketing and transportation earnings fell from Dollars 162m to Dollars 129m. Earnings from chemicals dropped to Dollars 9m, from Dollars 24m last time, before the benefit from the Dollars 56m sale of a South Korean joint venture by Arco Chemical, an 83 per cent-owned subsidiary. Higher natural gas prices, though, helped push exploration and production earnings to Dollars 160m before the gain on disposals, from Dollars 143m. First-half net income was up year-on-year, from Dollars 489m in 1992 (before a Dollars 392m for a change in accounting policy) to Dollars 531m. Unocal, also based in Los Angeles, reported second-quarter net earnings of Dollars 88m, or 33 cents a share, up from Dollars 66m, or 28 cents a year before. Excluding the effect of accounting changes and other special items, first-half net earnings were up from Dollars 76m to Dollars 186m.</p>

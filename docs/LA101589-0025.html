			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE  </P> <P> BLUESBUSTERS: The greatest of the blues greats was Muddy Waters, who gets his  due Nov. 7 when MCA Records releases a boxed-set of 72 classic Waters  performances. Besides his many hits, the collection will offer 10 previously  unreleased tracks, most notably a 1948 gem, "Good Looking Woman," a live  version of "Country Boy" and a 1959 outtake of "Take the Bitter With the Sweet"  complete with raucous in-studio dialogue between Waters and legendary Chess  producer Leonard Chess. The box also features a wealth of rare photos and  memorabilia, including a 1975 birthday telegram from his biggest fans, the  Rolling Stones, saying: "We are all thinking of you. If it had not been for  you, we would never be where we are today." (Now if only the Stones could  donate a tiny percentage of the mega-mega-bucks they're making on their U.S.  tour to help get Mississippi's Delta Blues museum off the ground). . . . And  this month's Truth in Advertising Award goes to Columbia Records, whose  full-page ads touting Bob Dylan's "Oh Mercy" album include a Musician magazine  review that is excerpted to read ". . . A masterpiece." Only one problem: Mark  Rowland's actual review reads "It's tempting to tout a strong album like 'Oh  Mercy' as . . . a masterpiece. It would be the easy thing to do -- but as the  philosopher Richard Nixon once pointed out, that would be wrong."  </P></p>

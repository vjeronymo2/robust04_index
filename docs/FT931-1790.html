			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / International Company News: Baltica moves to avert collapse BALTICA, Denmark's largest insurance-based financial services group, yesterday announced moves aimed at averting financial collapse and ending months of turbulence in the Scandinavian insurance industry. The group hived off Baltica Holding, the lossmaking parent company, and cut its shareholding in the insurance arm, Baltica Insurance, from 50.7 per cent to 24 per cent. The group also announced that the 1992 group loss climbed to DKr4.4bn (Dollars 700m), compared with a forecast last October of a loss of between DKr2.5bn and DKr2.8bn and a profit of DKr271m in 1991. Baltica Holding's shares, which were suspended on Friday, fell by DKr55 to DKr100 when the suspension was lifted yesterday. The two biggest shareholders in Baltica Holding are its troubled Danish rival, Hafnia, with 33.4 per cent, and France's Suez/Victoire group, with 23 per cent. In a further step, Baltica Insurance offered to buy Hafnia's insurance operations in what would be an all-Danish solution to a scandal that has rocked the country's financial sector. Hafnia Holding, Hafnia's parent company, suspended payments last August. Its insurance and banking operations have been put up for sale by international tender. However, Baltica's chairman, Mr Nils Wilhjelm, admitted yesterday that the fall in the value of Baltica Holding's shares would not make it any easier for Hafnia to find a buyer. Hafnia's board yesterday said it was 'positive' towards Baltica's offer, but Mr Wilhjelm - who said he would not seek re-election to the boards of either Baltica Holding or Baltica Insurance - emphasised that no deal had been made and that the offer would only apply if Hafnia could not find another buyer. Mr Wilhjelm added that the 1992 losses were so big that the holding company faced the risk that banks would cancel long-loan agreements. The proposed solution to Baltica's problem is complex. Baltica Holding is to set up a wholly-owned subsidiary, which will take over DKr2.1bn of bank debt in Baltica Holding and shares to the same value in Baltica Insurance. The new subsidiary would be merged with Baltica Insurance, which would mean that Baltica Insurance would own 27 per cent of its own shares. It would have to dispose of these within three years, or write down the value of its shares. Baltica Insurance's equity capital after yesterday's move would be worth DKr5.8bn, but after a DKr440m net loss last year, no dividend will be paid. Baltica Holding's remaining assets would be worth about DKr3bn, Mr Wilhjelm said. Its liquidity needs have been provided for as part of yesterday's arrangements, he added. The company will continue to own the loss-making Baltica Bank and property investments in Gibraltar and Denmark, which are one of the main sources of the financial problems. Lex, Page 22</p>

			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / International Company News: Profits at SSAB tumble sharply in first quarter SSAB, the Swedish state-controlled steel company that is being privatised, reported yesterday a profit of SKr87m for the first quarter of the year, down from SKr208m for the same period of 1991. The drop in profitability was blamed by the company on a lower volume of business. Operating revenues fell to SKr4.35bn from SKr5.08bn for the first quarter of 1991. But SSAB added that steel consumption in Sweden appeared to have stabilised at the level it reached at the end of last year. The company said that its prices were 6 per cent lower during the first four months of this year than the average they had been during 1991, but 3 per cent higher than the average for the past four months. SSAB's cash-flow amounted to SKr68m, compared with SKr 422m for the first quarter of last year, while its net liquid assets (after deduction of short-term financial borrowing) totalled SKr2.26bn, up SKr400m from the beginning of the year.</p>

			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Lowest ranks take brunt of cuts in UK armed services OFFICERS have escaped largely unscathed from cuts in the UK armed forces over the past decade, which have concentrated on the lowest ranks, according to official figures. The number of army privates and their equivalents in the navy and air force fell by more than a quarter between 1980 and 1992. Officer numbers fell by just 1.6 per cent over the same period. The number of colonels and lieutenant-colonels rose. Overall, the strength of the armed services fell by 36,891 between 1980 and 1992. But nine out of 10 of those were privates; the number of commissioned officers fell by just 630. The number of officers at the rank of major-general and above fell by 21 per cent, but the reductions in the number of other officers were small by comparison. A similar pattern can be seen among the 87,900 white-collar civilian staff employed by the Ministry of Defence. Their numbers have fallen by a quarter since 1980, but there has been no reduction in the number of middle and senior managers. The distribution of cuts was described as 'surprising' by Professor Paul Rogers, a defence expert at Bradford University. Under the last Labour government, there were substantial cuts at all ranks of officers. Between 1975 and 1980, the number of servicemen to each officer rose from 6.26 to 6.71. Since 1980, however, the number of servicemen per officer has fallen. After 14 years of Conservative government, there are now 5.89 servicemen to each officer. Over the same period, officers' pay rose by more than 170 per cent, while the pay of privates rose 138 per cent. A general now typically earns almost nine times the pay of a private, compared with seven times in 1980. The policy of getting rid of privates rather than officers, combined with widening pay differentials, has reduced the savings from manpower cuts. The proportion of the defence budget spent on pay rose from 36 per cent in 1985 to almost 42 per cent this year, while the proportion spent on equipment has fallen. Dr David Clark, Labour's defence spokesman, said the UK needed 'more ordinary squaddies for deployment on peacekeeping duties in places like Bosnia'. Officers found it all too easy to fill discharge lists with other ranks, he said.</p>

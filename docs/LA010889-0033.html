			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANDERSONVILLE, GA., MUSEUM HONORS THE NATION'S POWS  </P> <P> I am dying, comrades dying  </P> <P> Far away from friends and home  </P> <P> In this rebel den I'm lying  </P> <P> suffering, staring, all alone  </P> <P>  -- From poem written by an unknown Andersonville prisoner  </P> <P> All that is left of the infamous Confederate prison in this small, central  Georgia town are graves. In the 3-foot-deep trenches are the remains of 12,912  Union soldiers and sailors, buried side by side, shoulder to shoulder.  </P> <P> Usable clothing was removed to be worn by surviving prisoners or guards. Then  dirt was shoveled on top of their partially clad or naked bodies.  </P> <P> For the living, Andersonville was a place of horror. Prisoners lived in  squalor, their excrement everywhere. Many went insane. Many killed fellow  prisoners for a few morsels of food. Still others committed suicide, died from  scurvy, gangrene, dysentery and other diseases caused by poor sanitation,  malnutrition, contaminated water, overcrowding, exposure to the elements.  </P> <P> Largest of the Confederate military prisons, Andersonville existed for 14  months -- from February, 1864, to the end of the war in May, 1865. More than  45,000 Union troops were held here.  </P> <P> All prison buildings were torn down after the Civil War. The grounds are now  occupied by the Andersonville National Cemetery, National Historic Site and  National Prisoner of War Museum.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Only POW Museum  </P> <P> Since November, 1987, the National Park Service, in cooperation with the  American Ex-Prisoners of War, has operated the National Prisoner of War Museum,  the only one of its kind in the United States.  </P> <P> "It is appropriate that here at Andersonville, where so much suffering occurred  to Union prisoners, we honor and commemorate the sacrifices of all American  POWs throughout history," said Helen Smith, 62, historian since 1972 of the  30,000-member American Ex-Prisoners of War.  </P> <P> She is the wife of Allen Smith, 66, a retired Diana, Tex., millwright and World  War II Army Air Corps sergeant who was captured in the Philippines and held  prisoner by the Japanese for 42 months.  </P> <P> Helen Smith worked with John Tucker, 40, superintendent of the Andersonville  National Historic Site, to establish the POW museum, housed temporarily in a  62-year-old storage building on the cemetery grounds. Early this year, the  organization will launch a $2.5-million fund drive to help finance construction  of a larger permanent POW museum in Andersonville.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Letters and Diaries  </P> <P> The temporary museum is filled with memorabilia from POWs of World Wars I and  II, Korea and Vietnam. "We have space in the present museum to display only  about 10% of our archival resources," Smith said. "The museum's purpose is to  tell the POW story to the American people through interpretive exhibits."  </P> <P> On display are letters from POWs, prison camp diaries and artwork, exhibits  explaining psychological warfare, photographs of emaciated POWs upon their  release from the camps and maps showing their locations.  </P> <P> </P> <P> WWII Prison Camps  </P> <P> Another exhibit describes the 666 U.S. prison camps that housed 400,000  Germans, 50,000 Italians and 5,000 Japanese during World War II.  </P> <P> POWs from throughout the nation come to Andersonville to meet with museum  visitors and explain their lives as prisoners of war. Often they are  accompanied by their wives, who detail their own nightmares -- not knowing  whether their husbands were dead or alive, sometimes for months or years.  </P> <P> </P> <P> New Jersey Monument  </P> <P> William J. Thompson's haunting sculpture of a crippled POW leaning on a crutch  stands in front of hundreds of marble headstones marking the burial place of  Andersonville prisoners. Presented by Georgia in 1976, the statue honors all  American prisoners involved in all of the nation's wars, and carries the words  of Zechariah: "Turn you to the stronghold, ye prisoners of hope."  </P> <P> New Jersey erected a monument here in 1899 in memory of its residents who died  in the Confederate camp.  </P> <P> The graves were cared for then by the Grand Army of the Republic's Woman's  Relief Corps auxiliary. From 1910 to 1970 the GAR served as caretaker of the  graves. Since then the National Park Service has had the responsibility.  </P> <P> At the turn of the century, 20 states whose soldiers died here erected  monuments in their honor. The monument for Iowa is particularly poignant, a  weeping woman with the inscription: "Iowa honors the turf that wraps their  clay. Death before dishonor." The names of all Iowans buried here are on the  monument.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Kept Records of Dead  </P> <P> At war's end Clara Barton, founder of the American Red Cross, came here with a  detachment of laborers and soldiers, and former prisoner Dorence Atwater to  properly identify all the graves.  </P> <P> While a prisoner, it was Atwater's duty to keep records of the Union dead. When  a man died, a wooden stake bearing a number was hammered into the ground over  his remains. Atwater kept the list of names corresponding to the numbers.  </P> <P> Later, he and Barton directed the placement of wooden markers bearing the names  and state of each of the dead. In the 1870s and 1880s marble headstones  replaced the wooden ones. Barton also directed the successful campaign to  convert the Andersonville Prison graveyard to a National Cemetery.  </P> <P> Perched atop the marble headstone of Lewis S. Tuttle, a young soldier from  Saco, Me., is a marble carving of a dove. No one knows how it got there, when  or why. It's the only headstone different from all the others.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Only Person Charged  </P> <P> Capt. Henry Wirz, the commandant of Andersonville Prison, was the only Civil  War veteran charged with war crimes, was found guilty and then hanged on Nov.  10, 1865.  </P> <P> Charged with "conspiring to impair and injure the health and destroy the lives  of federal prisoners in violation of the laws of war," Wirz was described as a  monster and a fiend by Northerners. Southerners claimed he was a scapegoat, a  good soldier, a hero and martyr.  </P> <P> The Daughters of the Confederacy erected a large monument to Wirz on  Andersonville's main street "to rescue his name from the stigma attached to it  by embittered prejudice."  </P> <P> Wirz's daughter and granddaughter unveiled the monument on Nov. 10, 1909, the  44th anniversary of his hanging. An annual memorial service is conducted there.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Honored Posthumously  </P> <P> In 1981 Wirz was posthumously awarded the Confederate Medal of Honor at a  convention of the Sons of Confederate Veterans in Dallas. Wirz Street in  Andersonville is named in his honor.  </P> <P> "Feelings continue to run deep to this day about Capt. Wirz, about  Andersonville Prison, about the Civil War," said Mayor Lewis F. Easterlin, 79,  grandson of William Easterlin, a Confederate drummer boy at Andersonville  Prison. "It's good to research history and research it right, good to remember  history and remember it right."  </P></p>

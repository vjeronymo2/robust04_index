			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> BARDOT ANIMAL CRUSADER ON TV  </P> <P> Brigitte Bardot went on national television and used graphic film footage to  condemn trafficking in wild animals.  </P> <P> Bardot, 55, was the host of Wednesday night's "SOS Animal Trafficking," the  latest in a series on animal abuse. Other programs have targeted vivisection,  the ivory trade and the slaughter of elephants.  </P> <P> The sex symbol-turned-animal rights activist said public reaction to her  programs has been overwhelmingly positive.  </P> <P> "Hunters have sent me their hunting licenses, tourists have burned their ivory  bracelets, doctors support me in my fight against vivisection, and the sale of  horse meat in France has dropped by 30%," she said.  </P></p>

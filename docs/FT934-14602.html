			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / International Company News: Mexico cuts tax on interest for foreign loans THE Mexican government is cutting the tax that domestic companies pay on their interest on foreign bank loans. This is expected to reduce their cost of funding in foreign currencies. The government plans to reduce, initially for a two-year period, the withholding tax to 4.9 per cent, from 15 per cent, on their interest on bank loans. This will cut the cost of foreign bank funding by one-tenth. The tax reduction is expected to increase capital flows into Mexico. It may also put pressure on Mexican banks to lower their interest rates. The move will not affect bonds issued by Mexican companies, which are exempt from the tax.</p>

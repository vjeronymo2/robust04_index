			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Mauritania loses special trade status THE US has stripped Mauritania of special trade status and threatened to do the same for eight other nations, including Indonesia and Thailand, if they do not improve workers' rights. Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, said 'specific action plans' had been developed to improve worker rights in El Salvador, Guatemala, Indonesia, Thailand, Malawi and Oman. 'If countries fail to make substantial concrete progress in address worker rights concerns during (the next six months), their GSP benefits will be in serious jeopardy,' he said. He gave Indonesia eight months to bring its labour norms into line with 'international norms'. The generalised system of preferences (GSP) is a tariff-free programme designed to help the developing countries gain markets in the US, and it has often been used as an important trade policy tool. Mr Kantor's announcement was hailed by human rights activists.</p>

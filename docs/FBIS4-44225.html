			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Katarina Koivisto: "National Debt Threatens </F> Upturn"]    [Text] The economic upturn in Finland is getting under way  in earnest and is threatened mainly by the growing national  debt, the Business Research Institute, ETLA, predicted in its  latest market forecast. Net foreign debt, previously a limiting  factor in economic policy, is now declining rapidly with the  balance of payments showing a steady surplus, ETLA pointed out.    "If state borrowing increases in the future as it has done  so  far our chance of pursuing an active economic policy will be  reduced," said ETLA's chief executive, Pentti Vartia. "We cannot  handle employment policy in a future recession by taking out new  loans, for example, and interest on the national debt will  become so large that it rules out the possibility of pursuing an  active social policy."    In spite of the expected upturn, unemployment will remain  high in Finland. Five years from now, according to the research  institute's calculations, only 80,000 more people will be  employed than in 1993. New jobs will be created primarily in  industry, while jobs will continue to decline in construction  and agriculture.  <H5>  Steady Growth </H5>   But viewed as a whole, the picture of the Finnish economy  that ETLA has now painted is positive both for this year and for  the next five years. Research director Jukka Lassila pointed out  that we can now look forward to a long period of growth and that  it could be as strong as 6 percent next year. Gross national  product is expected to increase by 2 percent this year.    "The rising interest level does not yet limit our growth  expectations," said Lassila. "Interest has now reacted primarily  to external factors such as interest rates around Europe, there  are no real grounds for a rise in interest on the Finnish market  just now."    Private domestic consumption will start to increase  gradually, ETLA predicted, but growth on the domestic market  will continue to lag behind the growth rate in export branches.  Private consumption is at around the same level this year as it  was in 1986, but despite the fact that it is now rising by  several percentage points a year it will still not reach the  same level in 1998 that it had in 1990.    Industrial investments will now grow rapidly, according to  ETLA's prognosis. However the rapid growth is based on the  assumption that the world economy also grows and that Finland  becomes a member of the European Union, EU. Other factors that  will influence investment resolve include Finnish  competitiveness remaining good, improved profitability, and  increased utilization of capacity.    "In any case domestic market industries will not increase  their investments much in the next five years," said Lassila,  who also thought there would be no significant investment in new  housing.    Vartia saw no big problem in meeting the Bank of Finland's  2-percent inflation goal for the next five years. We have had  such a deep depression that there are no big inflationary  expectations in the wage sector, for example, and the fluid  markka lessens the external inflationary pressure.    Thus, according to ETLA, the big problem is the national  debt. Offsetting the increased interest expenses would require a  very restrained spending policy, and past experience shows that  this kind of thing is hard to implement, the research institute  noted. According to Vartia, the state's large debt means that  the best thing we can hope for is a long period of growth, but  only one that is more rapid than the basic 4-percent alternative  can balance the debt level. And this also assumes that increased  tax revenues do not lead to increased public spending.  <H5>  [Box, p 9] </H5>   Growth Alternatives, 1994-98 (in percent)                        Basic alternative   Gradual             Weak export                                           investment          growth                                           alternative         alternative   GNP, growth          4.0                 3.5                 3.5   Export, growth       7.0                 7.0                 5.5   Private              9.0                 6.0                 8.0  investment, growth    Private              2.5                 2.0                 2.0  consumption,  growth   Unemployment rate    14.0                16.0                16.0  in 1998   National debt in     80.0                85.0                85.0  1998, percentage  of GNP   Balance of           2.8                 3.0                 2.0  payments surplus,  percentage of GNP   Net foreign debt     25.0                25.0                30.0  in 1998,  percentage of GNP</p>

			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Arts: Beauty relocated - New York Ballet The San Francisco Ballet can lay claim to being the oldest company in America: the San Francisco Opera Ballet was formed in 1933 with the Diaghilev dancer Adolph Bolm as ballet master. But from the late 1930s the company was chiefly identified with the Christensen brothers: William (artistic director), Harold (director of the company's school), and especially Lew, Balanchine's first American Apollo, who succeeded William in 1951. From early on, therefore, there was a Balanchine connection, reaffirmed in 1985 when Helgi Tomasson left New York City Ballet to take over the company after Lew Christensen's death in 1984. The company's claim to national status was boosted by seasons at the Kennedy Center in Washington in 1990 and at the New York City Center in 1991. It recently played for a week at the New York State Theater in Lincoln Center, and the larger stage made it possible to show Tomasson's production of Swan Lake, dating from 1988. The original libretto states that 'the action takes place in Germany.' Not so in Tomasson's version: he has set it in 18th century France, with insipid designs by Jens-Jacob Worsaae. The first act begins with a frozen tableau perhaps meant to suggest a fete champetre after Watteau; the third act is in a salon decorated with paintings of the school of Boucher, behind one of which the vision of the betrayed Odette will appear. If Tchaikovsky had intended the ballet to happen in that place and time, he would no doubt have written music evocative of them. Tomasson does not appear to have any particular point to make by relocating the ballet this way: this is not a 'concept' production. Until the last act, he follows the usual sequence of numbers, more or less, except in Act II and the 'Black Swan' pas de deux in Act III he has changed all the steps, to very little effect. Then in Act IV he has thrown out most of the music and interpolated Tchaikovsky's 'Serenade melancolique' as another pas de deux for Odette and Siegfried. (What branch of the French nobility does he belong to?) The corps de ballet, which plays such a powerful role in both the Ivanov and Ashton versions of this act, has very little to do. This is too bad, since the corps made a strong impression in the second act. In general, this is a finely schooled company that up to now has lacked a world-class ballerina. Elizabeth Loscavio, who danced Odette/Odile on opening night in New York, has shown promise of becoming one and her Odile proved that she has technique to burn; her Odette was well thought-out - too well, it looked almost calculated at times. The dancer everyone in New York wanted to see was Tina LeBlanc, who left the Joffrey Ballet to join the San Francisco Ballet last year. On the second night of the San Francisco Ballet season she appeared in a very uncharacteristic role, the first ballerina in Rubies, and gave it a wit, freshness, and feminine charm it has not had since its originator, Patricia McBride. Rubies was the only Balanchine work shown in this brief season. The rest suggested that the company, like all companies today, has a repertory problem. Tomasson's works are not terrible; not in bad taste, not grossly unmusical, just not very interesting. He has also brought in the kind of works that represent today's international style in ballet: ballets by William Forsythe, James Kudelka, Glen Tetley (the Tetley piece was not given in New York). A Mark Morris work is promised for next year, a hopeful sign, except that it is anybody's guess whether the choice arose from some conviction as to the direction the company should take, or because Morris, like Forsythe, is fashionable just now.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gennadiy Belotserkovskiy under the "Elections" </F> rubric: "Bureaucrats Become Don Legislators"]    [Text] Rostov-na-Donu -- The Rostov Oblast Legislative  Assembly elections were declared valid, having passed off amid a  low level of enthusiasm on the part of the electorate, with just  35 percent turning out to vote. What is more, the elections  were disrupted in Rostov's two largest districts. So it is that  the first session of the "Don Parliament" will bring together  not 45 deputies, as planned, but 43.    "The victory of the administration over democracy is  absolute," Sergey Ivanenko, an eminent political expert from  Rostov, said in comment on the results. "Two-thirds of the  deputies are top bureaucrats."    I glanced at the lists of "lucky winners." And, indeed,  there are 10 heads of city and rayon administrations, four  holding the office of deputy head, and three leaders of  departments which are subordinate to the oblast administration  head. There are three chiefs of Internal Affairs  Administrations -- oblast, city, and rayon. There is one  banker, one counterintelligence staffer, and the deputy chief of  a workshop. There are three entrepreneurs, three journalists,  three kolkhoz chairmen, and three major enterprise directors.  It is interesting that Kozitsyn, ataman of the Oblast Cossack  Union of the Don Host, did not appear among the elected -- he  lost the election, and this is an indication of the degree of  popularity of the Cossack movement in the Don, which has  declined in the past year.    Of course, there was the inevitable furore. Aleksandr Boyko,  a native of Rostov and a senior lecturer in law at Rostov  University, does not believe he was defeated. He told me: "If  you count up the votes cast in my favor at the 28 polling  stations, and such documentation is available, then I beat  Karachentsev, head of the administration of Rostov City's  Sovetskiy Rayon, by 142 votes. However, the district commission,  having spent the whole night sitting at the computer to complete  the simple task of adding up the votes, accorded a winning  margin of four to him."    An official complaint has been lodged, and the matter now  rests with the Oblast Electoral Commission. But even if it is  upheld, this will not affect the overall situation. As forecast  by sociologists, there is no point in expecting a division of  powers on the Don. The new parliament will simply be another  cabinet, another tier in the bureaucratic pyramid. And, when a  session is held, virtually the entire body of the parliament  could go to the local governor's office for a detailed briefing.    Incidentally, Boyko, a qualified lawyer, considers it  unacceptable in a democratic state for "intermediaries" in the  form of certain "working groups," set up under administrations  at various levels to "give technical aid to the electoral  commissions," to come between the voters and the electoral  commission. In practice, the lawyer believes, these working  groups are exceeding their powers by securing an advantage for  their own chiefs.    "In their desire to shield themselves from a truly  independent legislative power, the bureaucrats have clearly  overdone it," political commentator Ivanenko believes. "After  all, by law, two out of five deputies in the Legislative  Assembly must work on a permanent basis. It is unlikely that  any one of the newly elected will resolve to leave their top  jobs in exchange for posts which are far less lucrative, laying  to rest a civil service career into the bargain. I am convinced  that this parliament will simply be unable to begin its work.  Furthermore, the Russian Federation State Duma may adopt a law  on local organs of power, under which this combination of deputy  and bureaucratic functions will be forbidden. What then? More  elections?"    So, the Don executive can be congratulated. It has become  the parliament. The only thing is, will it arrive at the truth  in debate with itself?</p>

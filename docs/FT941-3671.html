			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Anglo Utd sells Charringtons Fuel business for Pounds 41.5m Anglo United, the heavily indebted fuels group, yesterday announced the sale of its Charringtons Fuel business to management in a venture capital-backed deal worth Pounds 41.5m. Anglo will receive Pounds 30m, reducing the core bank debt to less than Pounds 100m. Last year the group reported negative shareholders funds of Pounds 145.1m. Mr John Gainham, managing director of Anglo, said the group had investigated other options for Charringtons such as a trade sale, but management had come up with the best offer. The managment team is led by Mr Howard Birtwistle, Charrington's chairman and a former director of Shell UK Oil. The team is backed by a syndicate headed by 3i, the venture capitalist group. The syndicate will provide Pounds 16.5m of equity finance, while debt and working capital facilities of Pounds 25m will be funded by Chemical Bank and the Royal Bank of Scotland. Management is investing about Pounds 200,000 and will hold some 22.5 per cent of the equity. An employee trust will hold a further 2.5 per cent. Mr Birtwistle said there were opportunities to expand Charrington's market share. Mr Gainham said Anglo could not afford to invest in Charringtons. The disposal would free Anglo to more than double its capital investment in its coal businesses from Pounds 2m to Pounds 5m in 1994-95. Mr Gainham said he was confident Anglo would improve its performance this year, after 1993's Pounds 30m pre-tax loss. However, there was considerable uncertainty given the lack of direction on the future of British Coal, for which Anglo once hoped to bid.</p>

Partnership for Peace offers Central and Eastern  European countries closer military cooperation with NATO and  envisages that they agree to gradual expanding of their  cooperation with NATO and not insist on immediate admittance to  the Alliance.    Klaus said these countries should bear in mind that for the  United States and other NATO member states, Russia is a power  which should be taken into consideration. Klaus was reacting to  Russian President Boris Yeltsin's statement today in which he  warned NATO of a possible negative reaction by the Russian  public to NATO's probable expansion eastward. Yeltsin described  the arguments of countries seeking membership in NATO as  "unconvincing."    Klaus said he knew that "Russia considered this issue to be  a  sensitive one," but added that the question was not urgent  because "nobody is offering us membership in NATO."    Klaus said that from the first moment when it become known  that on his way from Brussels to Moscow Clinton will stop in  Prague and meet representatives of the Visegrad countries -- the  Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Poland -- it was clear  that the talks would be separate. Speculations that the Czech  Republic was preventing or not preventing coordinated talks to  be held are superfluous, he added.    Klaus was thus reacting to reports which appeared in the  Czech and foreign media that the Czechs do not support the idea  of joint talks between high-ranking Visegrad officials and  Clinton during his January 11-12 visit to Prague.    At its meeting today, the Czech Government approved the  programme of Clinton's stay in Prague. The U.S. delegation will  meet for bilateral talks with delegations of the four Visegrad  countries. Bilateral talks between Klaus and the Polish, Slovak  and Hungarian premiers will take place in Hrzansky Palac.    After Clinton's departure from Prague on January 12, Czech  President Vaclav Havel, Klaus and Czech Foreign Minister Josef  Zieleniec will give separate dinners for their Visegrad  colleagues, Klaus said.</p>

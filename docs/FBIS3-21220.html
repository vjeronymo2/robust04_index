			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The Mechanical Engineering Laboratory (MEL) of the  Agency of Industrial Science and Technology have neared the  establishment of ultra-precision machining technology with  excimer laser for ceramic surfaces. MEL developed the new laser  method for softening ceramic surfaces and combined this method  with a machining technology with a diamond needle to perform  cutting with the depth precision of a micron. In the previous  chemical treatment, a ceramic sample was immersed in a liquid  that tended to unnecessarily soften the entire surface. In  contrast, with the new technology, only a desired part of the  surface is softened and cut. This technology is expected to  widen the application range of ceramics into the advanced  material field including x-ray mirrors.    According to Hiroko Hibi, the research engineer at MEL who  was carrying out the research, the ceramics used were silicon  nitride and silicon carbide. The laser was a krypton fluoride  excimer laser with a frequency of 249 nm (1 nm is  1/1,000,000,000th of 1 m). Each of the hollow, disk-shaped  samples of silicon nitride and silicon carbide, approximately 4  cm in diameter and approximately 8-mm thick (the diameter of the  hollow interior being approximately 1.5 cm), was irradiated by a  laser at each of three different energy levels; i.e.,  frequencies of 5, 10 and 20 Hz, and the ceramic surface was  softened. At the same time, the sample was rotated and its  surface was cut for 20 minutes with a diamond needle whose tip  had a radius of curvature of 0.1 to 0.15mm. As a result, with  the laser with a frequency of 5 Hz, a groove with a width of  slightly less than 0.2mm and a depth of approximately 7  was  made on the surface of the silicon nitride disk, and a groove  with a width slightly more than 0.2mm and a depth of 40  was  made on the surface of the silicon carbide disk. The cutting  width and depth are said to be controllable by adjusting the  needle size and the cutting time. In contrast, the lasers with  frequencies of 10 and 20 Hz cut grooves 5-10  deep on the  silicon nitride disks and 10-20  deep on the silicon carbide  disks, but the groove widths were as wide as 1mm, which was too  wide. Thus, the laser with a frequency of 5 Hz was considered to  be the most suitable for machining. At the higher frequencies,  surplus laser energy tended to soften the surface more than  necessary, apparently resulting in excessive cutting. Without  the aid of the laser, it was practically impossible to machine  these ceramic disks. The hardness of a 100-percent silicon  nitride ceramic piece was 17 gigapascal (giga is million, and  pascal is a pressure unit); whereas its hardness was reduced to  1.2-1.9 gigapascal after laser irradiation.    Laser irradiation causes silicon nitride and silicon carbide  to change into softer silicon dioxide and silicon. The energy  for this softening change is estimated to be at least 0.005  J/mm[.sup]2[/] for silicon nitride and at least 0.012  J/mm[.sup]2[/] for silicon carbide.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-12A>           Cutting with diamond needle with laser irradiation </FIG></p>

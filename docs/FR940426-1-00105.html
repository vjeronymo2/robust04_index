NHTSA believes that some occupants who find their safety belts to be uncomfortable, either wear their safety belts incorrectly or do not wear their safety belts. NHTSA believes that improving safety belt fit will encourage the correct use of safety belts and could have the potential to increase the overall safety belt usage rate. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> Comment Date:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments on this notice must be received by NHTSA not later than June 27, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Effective Date:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If adopted, the proposed amendment would become effective September 1, 1996. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments should refer to the docket and notice number set forth in the heading of this notice and be submitted to: NHTSA Docket Section, room 5109, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590.

L. 102&hyph;240). In response to this statutory mandate, NHTSA issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) on May 29, 1992 (57 FR 22687). The ANPRM listed three rulemaking options and posed ten questions. The options included: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> A. Take No Regulatory Action at This Time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. Adopt Detailed Regulatory Requirements to Ensure Proper Belt Fit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C. Adopt a General Requirement that Safety Belts Adjust to Fit Different Sized Occupants. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The ten questions asked for information on costs and benefits, and for comments on the test procedure. The ANPRM also included a discussion of the types of complaints the agency receives concerning belt fit. Finally, the ANPRM explained that any proposal addressing safety belt fit will encourage the correct use of safety belts and could have the potential to increase safety belt use. Of those persons who currently do not use safety belts because of improper fit, some would respond to the improved fit by beginning to use their belts or by wearing them more frequently.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Research  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since the ANPRM, the agency has conducted research on the issue of safety belt fit. A detailed discussion of this research can be found in a technical paper titled ``Improved Design for Safety Belts,'' a copy of which has been placed in the docket for this rulemaking. For this paper, the agency surveyed eight vehicles with non-adjustable shoulder belts and seven vehicles with various types of adjustable shoulder belts to determine how well the belts fit a family of dummies (the six-year-old, the 5th percentile female, the 50th percentile male, and the 95th percentile male). The survey used the comfort zone described in the ANPRM (Option B), modified as appropriate for the different sized dummies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the vehicles with non-adjustable shoulder belts, the belt was within the comfort zone 32.3 percent of the time for the six-year-old dummy, 94.3 percent for the 5th percentile female, 51.2 percent for the 50th percentile male, and 57.1 percent for the 95th percentile male. For the adult dummies, these results do not correlate with the pattern of belt fit complaints received by the agency. The complaints are often from shorter adults, suggesting that height may not be the only factor that affects safety belt fit. For example, the agency observed that, for two persons of the same height, the belt path was higher (approaching the neck) on the person with a larger torso. The agency also observed that belts tend to ride higher on the torso as the relative position of the belt anchorage and seat are changed so that the anchorage is farther to the rear in relation to the seat. This movement of the belt occurs because the belt tends to seek the straightest line path between its anchorages.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In vehicles with adjustable shoulder belts, the belts were within the comfort zone 33.3 percent of the time for the six-year-old dummy, 95 percent for the 5th percentile female, 85.7 percent for the 50th percentile male, and 100 percent for the 95th percentile male. These results show that currently available adjustable shoulder belt designs do improve safety belt fit for adults. The significantly lower percentage of both non-adjustable and adjustable belts within the comfort zone for the six-year-old dummy suggests that additional means, such as booster seats, are necessary for comfortable belt fit for such persons. Booster seats will raise the proper fit to over 80 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

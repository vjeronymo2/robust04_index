			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / International Company News: Pasminco loses ADollars 58.6m PASMINCO, the Australian lead and zinc group, blamed lower metals prices for a net loss of ADollars 58.6m (USDollars 41.9m) for the year to the end of June, against a loss of ADollars 47.6m the previous year. Revenue fell from ADollars 1.5bn to ADollars 1.3bn, largely reflecting falls of 11 per cent and 23 per cent in the average prices of zinc and lead on world markets. The loss was in line with the group's warning last month, which coincided with the partial unwinding of an 80.6 per cent joint shareholding formerly held by North Broken Hill Peko (North) and CRA, the Australian mining groups. Pasminco said the figure included an abnormal loss of ADollars 15.4m, reflecting rationalisation costs and a tax charge of ADollars 12.5m following a tax audit of 1985 to 1988 accounts. Bottom line loss rose to ADollars 140.1m after including a net extraordinary loss of ADollars 81.5m relating to the writedown of the Elura mine in New South Wales. There is no dividend.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Finally, with respect to the provisions of 18 U.S.C. 4007, the Bureau notes that Congress recently passed legislation which provides for inmates to pay for the costs of the first year of their incarceration, if they can afford to do so. See 18 U.S.C. 4001; Section 111 of Public Law 102&hyph;395 (106 stat. 1842). Thus, the Bureau does not read 18 U.S.C. 4007 as precluding the sale of goods and services in institution commissaries or charging the inmates with other fees authorized by law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Replacement of Collect Call System <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many commenters requested the retention of inmate collect call on demand privileges. These commenters recommended that the direct-dial system be added to, rather than replace, the collect call system, so that what the commenters refer to as a ``dual system'' could operate. The ``dual system'' would continue the collect call on demand capability of the former collect call system. The Bureau responds as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. As an initial matter, the Bureau notes that these comments may be based upon a belief that, with the installation of the ITS, inmates would no longer be allowed to make collect calls. However, the amended regulations allow for limited collect calling.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the proposed rule, the Bureau recognized that there is a need for inmates to be able to make collect calls in specific instances, such as emergencies, or for holdovers or pre-trial inmates. Section 540.101(d) of the proposed rule specifically addresses this issue. As expanded in the final rule, this section, now &sect;540.101(e), provides for a more comprehensive listing of those persons who have a need to make collect calls, such as new arrivals, including new commitments and transfers, and inmates without funds. Similarly, final &sect;540.105(b) specifically provides for collect calls to be available for inmates without funds. See further discussion below, in the section entitled ``7. COSTS.&blank;.&blank;. d. Inmates without funds.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Several inmate commenters complained that their low institution earnings and need to purchase personal hygiene items would prevent them from making as many direct-dialed telephone calls as they could make with the collect call system. While it is true that inmates do not earn regular scale wages, neither do they have regular living expenses, such as housing, clothing, food, medical and dental. In addition, the Bureau's existing policy on grooming, codified at 28 CFR part 551, subpart A, provides for the Warden to make available to inmates those articles necessary for maintaining personal hygiene. The Bureau's internal implementing language to that provision provides that the basic hygiene items to be made available to inmates include soap, toothbrushes, toothpaste or powder, combs, shaving supplies, and feminine hygiene products. Inmate complaints regarding provision of these basic items should be addressed through the Administrative Remedy Program. See 28 CFR part 542.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The average inmate has ample discretionary funds to purchase items of a personal interest, such as additional hygiene and cosmetic items, and direct-dialed telephone calls. As of October 1993, the monthly inmate trust fund account balance averaged $115.78 per inmate. Through June 1993, the annual commissary purchases made by inmates averaged $1,046.87 per inmate. At the institution where the majority of inmate comments on this rule originated, the annual commissary purchases averaged $1,254.09 per inmate and the average monthly inmate trust fund account balance was $101.95 per inmate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, the amended regulations encourage the inmates to establish spending priorities and to choose between such items as telephone calls, cigarettes, candy, and special hygiene products, thus furthering the correctional goal of assistng inmates to be financially responsible. The average citizen who must live within a budget must make similar spending choices, and may not be able to pay for any more long-distance calls than the two to three calls a month that one inmate commenter complained was only possible within his budget.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For these reasons, we do not agree with comments implying that it is wrong to require inmates to make choices on how to spend their funds. However, the Bureau believes that it is necessary to address telephone access for inmates without sufficient funds. The Bureau's accommodations on that point are noted below in the section entitled ``7. COSTS. . .d. Inmates without funds.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Some inmate commenters stated that the proposed regulations would force them to beg for telephone money from the people they want to call. The Bureau believes that such characterization also applies to the solicitation to accept a collect call. As one inmate commenter stated, ``[i]t is belittling for me to have to call anyone collect.'' Although this commenter advocated the installation of ``regular pay telephones,'' he preferred to place direct-dialed calls that he could pay for, rather than his family, because his family had experienced serious difficulties due to the large telephone bills from collect calls.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d. Some commenters requested the retention of the collect call system so that they can pay for an inmate's telephone calls. Commenters stated, in a form letter, that ``[t]he new telephone system would force me to send money to ensure that loved ones could call, but would offer no means of controlling if calls were made [to] me or the money was spent otherwise.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the amended regulations, people who would accept an inmate's collect calls may send the inmate money to defray the cost of the direct-dialed calls. As discussed in the section entitled ``PURPOSE OF THE AMENDED REGULATIONS,'' this will provide the inmate with an opportunity to demonstrate the responsible use of resources provided by the community. The recipients of an inmate's calls should also benefit as they can send less money to the inmate for the same amount of telephone time since the direct-dial rates are, on average, less expensive than the former collect-call rates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

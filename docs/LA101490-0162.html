			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEST BET  </P> <P> All ye who think of church music as ancient choruses from some dusty hymnal,  take note:  </P> <P> All Saints Episcopal Church in Pasadena is singing a different tune.  </P> <P> Premiering tonight is "Musica Mundial," a concert of culturally diverse,  modern-  </P> <P> day religious music for a new world.  </P> <P> "We're suggesting that our music is the answer to the question, 'What is the  current-day religious music?' for people who want to feed the hungry, treat men  and women as equals, save the Earth and promote peace," said Ray Egan, composer  </P> <P> and music director at All Saints.  </P> <P> In keeping with the international spirit of musica mundial (which means "world  music" in Portuguese and Spanish), a five-person band and eight-person chorus  will perform a number of Latin American-influenced songs with the help of an  extensive Latino percussion section.  </P> <P> Most of the songs on tonight's program are being performed for the first time,  Egan said. About half of the composers are from far-away lands, such as Brazil  and Argentina.  </P> <P> Also featured will be a rendition of the  </P> <P> American poet E. E. Cummings' verse "i thank you God," composed by Egan.  </P> <P> Egan said some of the music is based on biblical texts and theological themes,  but as seen through the eyes of the liberation theology movement in emerging  nations.  </P> <P> "It's a theology that emanates from our own time as opposed to our  grandparents' world," Egan said.  </P> <P> The concert will begin at 7 p.m. at All Saints, 132 N. Euclid Ave. in Pasadena.  A $5 donation is requested. A second concert is being planned for February,  1991. MARY ANN SWISSLER  </P></p>

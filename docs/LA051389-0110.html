			<p><P> May 13, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FULLERTON FAIRE WILL MARK FOUNDERS DAY  </P> <P> It's Founders Day in Fullerton, and those intrepid souls who first settled the  Orange County city would scarcely recognize the place, at least not today and  definitely not at the Street Faire.  </P> <P> With free shuttle service wheeling visitors to and from the "fair grounds"  (Pomona Avenue, between Chapman and Commonwealth avenues), the celebration, 11  a.m. to 4 p.m., is a continuation of a pancake breakfast, a 10 a.m. parade down  Harbor Boulevard and Open Houses at the police and fire departments.  </P> <P> At the Faire, kids can ride not only atop elephants and camels but on the  Maintenance Services Department's cherry pickers and backhoes. Entertainment  will include a magician, a Dixieland trio, a steel-drum band, a barbershop  quartet, mariachis and belly dancers, while 90 booths offer arts, crafts and  foods, and a beer garden affords rest and relaxation for harried parents.  </P></p>

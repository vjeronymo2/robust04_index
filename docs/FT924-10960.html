			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Bridport-Gundry dips to Pounds 750,000 Bridport-Gundry almost maintained its profit in the year to July 31, despite the trading climate and without the considerable benefits it gained in 1991 from the Gulf conflict. From turnover of Pounds 27.3m (Pounds 36.2m including Pearsalls Thread, since sold) pre-tax profit came to Pounds 751,000 (Pounds 785,000). Earnings per share were 6.32p (6.06p) and the final dividend is 2.6p for an unchanged total of 4.1p. Following withdrawal from the fishing industry in the US and Canada and rationalisation of net manufacture in the UK, directors anticipate sales to the fishing sector will have fallen from over 40 per cent to below 15 per cent of turnover by the end of the current year. Sutures, aviation and defence businesses, together with industrial and sports products, now form the core of the group.</p>

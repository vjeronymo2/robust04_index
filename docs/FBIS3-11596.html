			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In Haiti, a mobilization is being organized against  the humanitarian aid from France. Several Haitian political  organizations oppose the arrival of the French humanitarian aid,  530 tons of food products sent by France for underprivileged  Haitian students. The aid will be sent to Port-au-Prince by sea  and is expected to arrive on 25 March.    FRAPH [Revolutionary Front for the Promotion and Progress of  Haiti] member Emmanuel Constant calls the French initiative  cynical. According to FRAPH, it constitutes trampling on Haitian  pride; and FRAPH added, for the information of the French  Government: You are starving an entire nation, just so you can  later give alms to clear your conscience.    Another organization, Capois-La-Mort, supports the FRAPH  position unreservedly. Capois-La-Mort leader Frank Pierre says  no to the French humanitarian aid ship and takes the opportunity  to denounce France's position. France has always demanded a  total blockade against Haiti.    [Begin Pierre recording, in Creole] We in Capois-La-Mort are  saying no, 9 times 99 times no! We will not have this  humanitarian aid ship land in Haitian territorial waters. We are  [hereby] sending the French Embassy in Haiti the message -- to  be conveyed to President Francois Mitterrand of France -- that  we in Capois-La-Mort will not have this ship entering Haitian  territorial waters. Therefore, we ask President Mitterrand to  stop this ship now, in Guadeloupe -- because the ship will just  have to go right back to where it came from. It might as well  even carry extra fuel, so that it does not stay even an hour  longer in Haitian territory. [end recording]    On the other hand, ALAH [Alliance For the Liberation and  Progress of Haiti] leader Reynold Georges has dissociated  himself from the position taken by FRAPH and Capois-La-Mort.  Georges thinks this French humanitarian aid could help prevent  the death of children in Haiti.    [Begin Georges recording, in Creole] If a country feels it  cannot let the Haitian people die of hunger and wants to offer  some aid, I believe we must accept the aid -- because there is  no glory in death. I believe that the aid must come, otherwise  many children will die; and I think the reason those people  would prefer that the aid not arrive is because they want to  capitalize on the death of those children.    We think the aid should come. If not, then FRAPH should give  it! Along with all the other people who continue to support the  coup d'etat -- because since 1986 the Army has been choosing the  governments and then overthrowing them [end recording].    Attorney Mireille Durocher Bertin opposes the arrival of the  French humanitarian aid. [Begin Durocher  recording]...consciously and categorically refuse humanitarian  aid however derisory it may be, if it can prevent even a single  child from dying of hunger. However, we must, it is our duty  to, protest against the hypocrisy of certain nations that, after  strangling us, seem to supply us with a slight breath of air for  an artificial, false, derisory, temporary resuscitation.    When France -- which is still calling for tightening the  economic sanctions against Haiti -- says that it wants to feed  50,000 children for four months, I would like to ask France:  What will happen to the other millions of children that it is  starving?    They want to reduce us to our simplest expression, on the  pretext of imposing on us, with Mr. Aristide's return, a  so-called democracy.    France wants to punish its former rebellious colony and use  it as an example to the other black nations. If they really want  to help the women and children of Haiti, they should stop  interfering in our internal affairs. [end recording]</p>

			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: PM stresses party unity on ERM MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday moved to emphasise that his commitment to sterling's parity in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism had the full backing of his cabinet colleagues. As senior ministers acknowledged that divisions on the Conservative backbenches had contributed to speculation against sterling, Downing Street signalled publicly that the cabinet was unequivocally behind the prime minister's stance. Officials said that he had reminded yesterday's cabinet meeting that when Britain had joined the ERM it had not been a 'short-term option'. Instead it offered the means to reduce inflation and provide a stable basis for sustained growth. That meant that the commitment was '100 per cent'. Mr Major's reminder of the need for his colleagues to present a united front  -a view subsequently endorsed even by ministers who were initially sceptical about entry to the ERM - was followed by a sharp attack on the government's economic strategy by Mr Neil Kinnock. It coincided also with private acknowledgement by ministers that the public calls for devaluation by some 'maverick' Conservative MPs had prompted foreign exchange traders to believe that the prime minister might be under pressure from within his government to change course. The outgoing Labour leader used his last confrontation with Mr Major at prime minister's questions to warn that present policies risked turning the recession into slump. Mr Kinnock, who stands down as leader at the weekend, was careful to avoid a direct call for a realignment, but he urged the prime minister to use the summer parliamentary recess to adopt a more ex-pansionary economic strategy. Predicting that the recovery would get under way during the second half of this year, Mr Major responded that there was 'no other way' to lay the foundations for sustained growth. The same message will be delivered in a letter being sent to all Conservative MPs by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, later today. With ministers acknowledging that MPs are coming under pressure from their constituency parties over small business bankruptcies and rising unemployment, Mr Lamont will emphasise the medium-term gains of sticking with the present policy. The chancellor, who was finalising the letter last night, will warn of a tough clamp-down on public spending but he will add that an attempt to 'kick-start' the economy now would wreck the prospect of sustainable recovery.</p>

			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Modernisers put jazz before the Red Flag Few believed a Labour party conference would ever end like this. Delegates stared in disbelief as a team of colourfully clad musicians burst through a side entrance of the Winter Gardens, sauntered up to the platform and proceeded to pump out New Orleans jazz. Before they prepared to sing the Red Flag, Mr Tony Blair's party clapped along to the Dixieland numbers. And to cap it all, Mr John Prescott, the deputy leader, executed a neat jive with his wife on the conference platform, receiving some of the loudest applause of the week. As a historic conference drew to a close many delegates were delighted to see Mr Blair's 'New Labour' party openly enjoying itself, matching the Tory reputation for joie de vivre, looking to viewers at home like a member-friendly party. But for many leftwingers the images at this conference - the greenish backdrop, the questioning of Labour's basic beliefs, the leader's smart-suited aides clutching portable telephones - have left a sense of unease. With Dixieland music still ringing in his ears, Mr Leigh Richman, a 26-year old delegate from Peckham, asked a question that has been on many lips this week: 'Where on earth is the Labour party going?' As they hurried to leave Blackpool yesterday it was the so-called 'modernisers' - the men and women who back Mr Blair's campaign to unhinge Clause 4 and the commitment to common ownership - who had the clearest answer. Yes, the delegates' decision to reassert the cherished commitment to nationalisation had been a setback for Mr Blair. The conference had defied his call for a revision of the constitution and had brought his post-election honeymoon to a close. But this did not reduce their delight that Mr Blair was now taking on the dinosaurs of the left. Mr Mike Gapes, MP for Ilford North, said: 'I left last year's conference with pessimism. I felt then that we weren't progressing anywhere. Now I believe we are moving forward and changing the party for the better.' Mrs Anne Inelgrove from Bracknell concurred. The conference decision to back Clause 4 could be ignored. 'Without that row, people would have said the conference was stage-managed,' she said. 'But the truth is that most of the party is now reconciled to change.' Above all, Mr Blair's supporters relished the quality of his keynote speech. One delegate said: 'When Neil Kinnock addressed conference, you could often fall asleep, wake up again and find he was on the same theme. This week we got John F. Kennedy.' For the activists on the left of the party it was very different. As they prepared to go home the anger over Clause 4 had not been allayed. Mr John MacIntyre, president of the MSF technical union, said: 'Tony Blair made a tactical mistake by raising the issue. There was simply no need for him to make that reference in the speech.' Indeed, criticism was not hard to find. 'A disastrous week,' was the verdict of Mr Bill Stevens from Plymouth and Sutton. Mr Tom Farnhill, a 20-year-old delegate from East Devon, said: 'He couldn't have chosen a worse time to raise this issue.' Another delegate said: 'In the next few months this could seriously split the party.' As he sets about revising the constitution Mr Blair knows that he has the upper hand because the hard left of the party is losing ground. One leftwing MP said there were many like himself who believed that their best hope now was to take up the challenge Mr Blair had set them, redefining 'common ownership' in a modern context. He said: 'Our slogan has to be: 'New Britain, New Labour, New Left'.' Like some delegates, he believed Mr Peter Hain, the MP for Neath, could play a prominent part in developing the theme. But even some of the leader's closest supporters expressed concern that change was being driven too fast. One rightwing MP privately admitted that Mr Peter Mandelson, the party's former campaign director and a close aide to Mr Blair, had abused the unions too much at the conference and could sow divisions. As they left Blackpool many delegates believed that next year's conference would bring this week's divisions - over Clause 4, the minimum wage and full employment - to a head. But they also knew that Mr Blair and Labour have set a formidable challenge.</p>

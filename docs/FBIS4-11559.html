			<p>BFN     [Text] The Haitian Army high command blamed the 22 April  incident in Gonaives on armed individuals wanting to destabilize  the state. The Army has not issued a final toll, but allegedly  28 deaths occurred, according to the latest count.    The communique signed by the Secretariat of the General  Staff  also points out that the military operation took place on the  night of 24-25 April, not at dawn on 22 April as reported in the  accounts of area residents. They explain that the police  operations took place in Raboteau, a Gonaives suburb, to thwart  the action of armed individuals who, according to bits of  intelligence, were preparing to sabotage public institutions and  attack the Artibonite Military Department Headquarters, the  premises of the departmental military command.    According to the Haitian high command, the Gonaives incident  and other recent incidents are the results of the steps of the  plan conceived during the meeting in Washington on 21 November  1993 in which some ministers of the resigning government  participated.    The military institution has renewed its determination to  guarantee order and public peace and its firm intent to stop the  actions of those who are devoid of the sense of state,  institutions, and harmony that must exist within the Haitian  family, the text adds.    The incident allegedly caused 28 deaths, according to the  latest testimony collected by AFP. Most of the victims, over 15,  were reached as they were trying to escape by sea. All but two  were buried on the spot. As of now, their identities are  unknown, they explain.    An important exodus occurred after the tragedy. Most of the  frightened inhabitants fled the neighborhood, still under high  military surveillance, to take refuge in other regions of the  city or country. According to the local Justice and Peace  Commission of the [Catholic] Church, soldiers shot at residents  of the area without warning. The correspondent of a private  radio station reported that shots were fired before the arrival  of the military.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the proposal, the definition of return air would be modified to permit operators to designate certain air courses as return air courses for the purpose of ventilating structures, areas or installations that are required to be ventilated to return air courses and for ventilating seals when this air will not be used to ventilate working places. Thus, an operator wishing to split air off of an intake for the purpose of ventilating shops, electrical installations, or for other purposes, could designate the air course into which the split is directed as a return provided the air in the air course would not used to ventilate working places or other locations, structures, installations or areas required to be ventilated with intake air. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency does not intend that operators routinely redesignate air courses from intake to return. Should questions arise as to the need to redesignate an intake as a return, MSHA will be available for consultation. Additionally, in order that all interested parties are made aware of the redesignation, MSHA is proposing to require in &sect;75.372, Mine ventilation map, that air courses that are redesignated from intake to return for the purposes discussed above be shown on the mine ventilation map.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 75.310&blank;Installation of Main Mine Fans  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Main mine fans provide the means by which mechanically produced pressure is supplied to the mine ventilating current. The Agency is proposing to revise paragraphs (a)(3), (a)(4) and (c) of &sect;75.310. The existing standard requires, in part, that each main mine fan be installed on the surface in an incombustible housing and be connected to the mine opening with incombustible air ducts. Paragraph (a)(3) of existing &sect;75.310 requires that each main mine fan be equipped with an automatic device that gives a signal when the fan either slows or stops. The signal from this device is to be placed so it can be seen or heard by a responsible person who has been designated by the operator and who is always on duty when persons are underground.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During informational meetings held with the mining community, it was suggested to the Agency that the standard should be clarified in two respects. First, it was stated that the provision was not clear as to whether the signal must automatically be given at a surface location at the mine. Second, the Agency was asked to clarify whether a fan monitoring system used in lieu of a circular pressure recorder to monitor fan pressure must generate a continuous graph or chart.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To address the first of these concerns, proposed paragraph (a)(3) specifically would require the signal to be given at a surface location at the mine where it could be seen or heard by a responsible person designated by the operator who is always on duty when persons are underground. Under the proposal, two-way communication with working sections would continue to be required. The requirement would be extended to include established locations where persons are normally assigned to work, such as belt transfer points and shops. This requirement is consistent with existing Subpart Q_Communications, but may require the installation of a limited number of mine phones at locations off the section. Many of these locations are routinely equipped with two-way communication even though it is not required by the existing standard. It is not intended that this communications capability be provided in areas where persons are assigned to work temporarily, such as areas where secondary roof support is being installed or where rock dust is being applied. The requirement that two-way communication be provided to locations where persons are normally assigned to work is intended to assure that these persons receive prompt notification of fan stoppages. Because these work locations are off the section, a lack of communication capabilities could result in delays in notification and therefore delays in withdrawal. The requirement that the signal be given at a surface location at the mine is not intended to preclude the signal from also being given elsewhere, such as at a central office, as long as it is given at the mine as previously discussed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The existing rule requires that each main mine fan be equipped with a pressure recording device or a main mine fan monitoring system. Traditionally, the instrument of choice for recording fan operating pressure has been the mechanical, circular pressure recorder. As the name implies, this device generates a record of the fan pressure. This record is generated continuously as a chart that is replaced weekly. Paragraph (a)(4) of the existing rule specifically refers to the use of a fan monitoring system as an alternative to the pressure recorder. The proposal eliminates this reference since other means of continuously monitoring the fan pressure and providing a record may be acceptable. Relatively recent advances in technology have permitted the measurement and recording through other means. This proposed provision would permit the use of this technology for monitoring main mine fan pressure, provided, as proposed in paragraph (a)(4), that a continuous record of the pressure is maintained. The proposal would require that when a pressure monitoring device is used in lieu of a pressure recording device, it produce a continuous graph or chart of the fan pressure. A hard copy of the continuous graph or chart would be printed at regular intervals of not more than 7 days. The generated graph or chart would be required to correlate fan pressure to the time and date. The term ``continuous'' refers to the frequency with which the device polls the fan pressure to obtain the data. It is the Agency's understanding that typical polling frequency is on the order of a few seconds. MSHA is soliciting comments as to an appropriate polling frequency that would provide a record that is substantially continuous.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Records of the fan pressure generated by a pressure monitoring device would be maintained in accordance with existing &sect;75.312(h). That is, the records would be maintained at a surface location at the mine for at least one year and would be made available for inspection by authorized representatives of the Secretary and the representative of miners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to permitting fan monitoring systems to be used as a means of recording fan pressure, the existing rule permits the use of other devices for measuring fan pressure under certain circumstances. This exception is for mines permitted to shut down main mine fans as approved in the ventilation plan. As explained more fully in the preamble for &sect;75.310(a)(4) of the existing rule, this provision provides a compliance alternative for small mines that normally operate only one shift a day and do not have sealed or unsealed worked-out areas. For these mines, the existing rule allows the use of a pressure measuring device if the use of the device is approved in the ventilation plan for the mine. The proposal would continue this practice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (c) of the existing rule specifies the minimum requirements for a fan monitoring system, including the parameters that a fan monitoring system must monitor if it is to be used in lieu of the daily fan check required by &sect;75.312. The Agency continues to support the use of these systems or any other technology effective in enhancing safety but believes, based on comments received, that the additional requirements relative to the use of these systems are warranted. Specifically, commenters suggested that the information generated by fan monitoring systems be provided at a surface location at the mine where a responsible person is always on duty when persons are underground and that this information be reviewed by mine management. The Agency agrees with these suggestions and proposes in paragraph (c) to require that when a fan monitoring system is used in lieu of the daily fan examination required by &sect;75.312 the monitoring system would be required to have the capability of providing, on demand, a printout of the information being monitored. This capability is intended to facilitate the review of the information by mine management required in &sect;75.312(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

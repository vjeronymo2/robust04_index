			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEST BET  </P> <P> The holiday season is upon us once again, and once again you will have the  opportunity to watch "It's a Wonderful Life" or "Miracle on 34th Street" almost  every other day. To break the holiday rut, watch a different kind of Christmas  story. The Original Theatre Works of Cerritos College will present the Lee Korf  award-winning comedy "Your Father Owned a Reindeer" on selected dates beginning  Friday through Dec. 15 in the Burnight Studio Theatre.  </P> <P> New York playwright Richard Holland has written an offbeat story revolving  around the holiday celebration of the eccentric Scavulo family. The assorted  cast of characters includes Rebecca Bailey as Carol Scavulo, the oldest Scavulo  daughter; Charles Gorman as Izzy, Carol's anthropologist husband; Dorothy  McClane as Martha, matriarch of the Scavulo clan; Fred Lanciloti as Sal, the  Scavulo patriarch; Susan Alderette as Sharon Scavulo and Jeff Tucker as Brian,  her lover, a musician and waiter; Cliff Schneider as Doug Scavulo, the  perpetual salesman; and Alecs Vildosola as Donnie Scavulo, a fashion designer.  </P> <P> The play is set in Izzy and Carol's living room, adorned with various  archeological and anthropological artifacts that are decorated by Carol with  traditional Christmas trimmings. Martha lobbies for her first grandchild by  giving Carol a sexy negligee as a present. Sal celebrates Christmas in his own  special way, by betting on a horse named Christmas Tree. But personal quirks  and hard-fought attempts at communication do not dampen the family's  expectations of a happy holiday.  </P> <P> More than 200 plays were submitted nationally for the Lee Korf Playwriting  Award, and this one by Holland was one of three winners. Holland became a  professional playwright in 1981. He has served as assistant director for "The  Chosen," Chaim Potok's $3.5-million off-Broadway musical, co-founded  Stagewrights, a nonprofit playwrights' theater, and has had finalist entries in  the O'Neill Competition and the Rosenthal New Play Prize. Holland is currently  working on a musical adaptation of Mark Twain's "The Prince and the Pauper,"  which is expected to play Broadway in the fall of 1992.  </P> <P> "Your Father Owned a Reindeer" will be presented at 8 p.m. Friday, Saturday,  Dec. 13, 14 and 15 and at 2:30 p.m. Dec. 9. Burnight Studio Theatre is on the  Cerritos College campus, 11110 Alondra Blvd., Norwalk. Tickets are $7.50 and  can be purchased at the door. This play contains some adult language and may  not be suitable for children. For more information, call 924-2100.  </P></p>

			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / French far right's advance masks rise on another front: Next month's regional polls are likely to show a dramatic surge in support for the ecology parties THE SURGE in voter support in France for the extreme right-wing National Front is monopolising national attention, sending a frisson of anxiety through all the mainstream political parties, on the right as well as on the left. Because of the ominous overtones of racism and angry xenophobia, it is overshadow ing the important parallel surge in support for the country's ecology parties, which may end up in next month's regional elections with a share of the national vote not far short of that of the NF. While all eyes seem fixed on the Front - with many surveys suggesting it will gain between 15 and 20 per cent of the vote nationally - the dramatic advance of the ecologists has also been shown in a series of regional opinion polls. In the Paris region of Ile-de-France they should get 15 per cent compared with 3.4 per cent six years ago; in the Centre region they may score 17.5 per cent compared with 0.3 per cent; in Basse Normandie 17 per cent, in Haute Normandie 18 per cent and in Brittany 16 per cent. In tactical terms, the traditional parties are less worried by the ecology breakthrough than by the National Front's: the NF faces them with agonising dilemmas, not least about how to woo the Front's potential voters without endorsing its prejudices, and, whereas the ecologists seem both innocent and benign, all parties can profess friendliness towards the environment. In reality, the political establishment should be twice as exercised, because the message of the double breakthrough is that the electorate is deserting its traditional political allegiances on a very large scale. If one includes the rump Communist party, which is likely to stay stuck in the 5-10 per cent range, it is entirely possible that the protest parties will together account for some 40 per cent of the total vote, with the remaining 60 per cent to be shared by the three mainstream parties. The second reason the ecologists are not commanding much national attention is that they are divided into two quarrelling wings: Generation Ecologie (led by 46-year-old Brice Lalonde, who as the ecology candidate in the 1981 presidential election got 3.85 per cent and is now Environment Minister in the Socialist government) and the Greens (led by 43-year-old Antoine Waechter, who as the ecology candidate in the 1988 presidential election did slightly worse at 3.78 per cent). The quarrel dates to the formation of the Green party in 1984 and revolves round the question of the relationship of ecology to the politics of power. The Greens accuse Mr Lalonde of selling out to the socialists, in particular for failing to strike a strong enough blow against nuclear power. Generation Ecologie claims to be a movement (not a party) with the reformist aim of changing minds, and accuses the Greens of being unrealistically purist. The Greens claim that Generation Ecologie is an undemocratic machine for the personal ambitions of Mr Lalonde. But the central fact is that the split does not seem to have damaged the ecologists' voter appeal. This started to take off three years ago, in the 1989 European elections, when the Greens scored 10.6 per cent. Next month the combined ecologists' score could well be 50 per cent higher, probably split fairly evenly between the two movements. The unstated agenda behind the rise of the protest parties is the question of electoral reform. Regional elections, like those to the European Parliament, are decided on the basis of proportional representation, whereas those to the National Assembly are decided on a majority vote. The result is that neither the Front nor the ecologists are represented in Parliament. President Francois Mitterrand has repeatedly indicated a temptation to switch the national voting rules to proportional representation before the general elections scheduled for next year. The ostensible purpose of such a manoeuvre would be to make Parliament more representative. The real purpose would be to prevent a tidal victory by the traditional conservative parties over his Socialists, by letting in other minority parties. Socialist Party leaders are opposed to PR, even though it might dilute the scale of their likely defeat this time, because they fear it could also dilute the scale of their possible recovery in some later election. But if the regional elections show that 30 per cent of the electorate is unrepresented in Parliament, the pressures for some degree of national PR could become irresistible.</p>

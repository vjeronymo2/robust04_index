			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Collecting: Art market begins to build a recovery led by Old Masters - Hopeful signs in London's salerooms SUDDENLY, there are the first green sprouts of spring, suggesting a re-awakening in the market for pictures as well. In New York at the end of February, both Sotheby's and Christie's sold second division Impressionist and Modern art well - 12 per cent unsold at Sotheby's and an impressively modest 10 per cent bought-in at Christie's. Of course, sellers had to be arm-twisted into putting low reserves on their pictures, and prices generally were up to 50 per cent lower than two years ago; but private collectors were back and bidding for run-of-the-mill works by Chagall and Soutine, Utrillo, and even poor old Picasso. Above all, the auctions were seen to be a success, encouraging greatly that elusive plant called confidence. It is the same in London. Agnews has had a tremendous response to the portraits of 31-year-old Sarah Raphael, selling 80 per cent of her exhibition in just three weeks at prices ranging up to Pounds 12,500. And, next door in Bond Street, Marlborough did equally well with the landscapes of Christopher Bramham. Both artists are accessible - very English in their style but backed by sinewy strength. More to the point, Agnews is confident of selling at least two of the expensive Old Masters it is exhibiting as part of its 175th anniversary show. Across the road, Leger has one of its finest exhibitions for some time to celebrate its centenary. It is offering British landscapes, ranging in price from Pounds 1,000 to more than Pounds 1.5m for one of Gainsborough's most brilliant late landscapes. The presentation of such high-quality pictures is bound to entice buyers, particularly overseas museums which are largely unaffected by financial uncertainties. In Madrid, meanwhile, the Old Master sale of Edmund Peel was only 4 per cent unsold, with a rare work by Yanez going to the Prado Museum for Pounds 435,555. In New York, there were particularly encouraging Old Master auctions at both Sotheby's and Christie's. This has inspired the belief that the revival in the picture market will be led by Old Masters, and there are good historical reasons why this should be so. In spite of the blandishments of the dealers, the Japanese - whose on-off love affair with Impressionist and modern art caused the wild fluctuations in their price, leading to the present sad slump - have never really understood or collected Old Masters. Consequently, this sector escaped the speculative fever and remained a connoisseur's market, bought by museums, committed collectors and the odd bold spirit (like Madonna) who wanted to move beyond the easy iconography of modern art. There are undoubted problems with Old Masters such as those of attribution, condition, subject matter, availability, and the fact that the great masterpieces are invariably tucked away in museums. But they still represent the greatest manifestation of western art, and the growth in art history has opened up virtually every period, and country, to informed comment. Discoveries and re-attributions are being made constantly - notably, in recent months, the confirmation of an exquisite Raphael belonging to the Duke of Northumberland; a Titian; and a Sebastiano. (The latter two are leaving the UK for the Getty Museum in Malibu.) It is not surprising, then, that when Christie's was asked by the Marquess of Cholmondeley to find a buyer for his 'Portrait of a lady with pet squirrel and a starling' by Holbein, it wanted to rush it to auction (on April 15) rather than go through long, complicated, and perhaps unsuccessful negotiations on a private treaty sale. A high-profile auction, achieving an anticipated price of Pounds 15m-plus  - which would make it the most expensive Old Master yet sold in the UK  - would galvanise the market, particularly as two other fine works, by Rembrandt and Canaletto, could be included in the same sale. They, too, come from landed English families worried by the prospect of a high-taxing Labour government after the general election and by the fact that Arts Minister Tim Renton is proposing a list of national treasures that cannot leave the UK. Of course, Christie's would also earn more money from an auction than from a negotiated deal. Christie's has run into a storm, though. The heritage lobby has rallied behind keeping the Holbein in the UK and talks are under way on a possible private treaty sale, to the National Gallery. After paying 60 per cent tax on a market sale of the Holbein, Cholmondeley might actually do better selling to the National - even if he has to wait three years for all his money. Undoubtedly, an auction would be a useful test of the strength of the art market. There are only around 10 known bidders for the three paintings but, at this quality level, a new mega-rich collector in another field could possibly be persuaded to show an interest, especially in the Holbein. Christie's is obviously doing what is best for Christie's but, in a strange way, the successful sale of this rare painting would have a knock-on effect right down to the hustlers in the Portobello Road. For many dealers, this year will show little or no improvement on the abysmal 1991; but the blocks on which the revival will be built are being established slowly. It will rise on private buying rather than trade bidding, for many dealers are over-stocked and debt-ridden. In furniture and silver, jewellery and stamps, there have been some very good auctions in recent weeks. Pictures, along with classic cars, felt the full force of late-1980s' speculation and some sectors, like the Impressionists, may take five years to recover to their 1989 price levels. But Old Masters, which suffered least, are already displaying ingrained strength. The furore over the Holbein just confirms their ability to stir up strong emotions and to tap large sums of money.</p>

			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Arts: Luscombe goes solo - Theatre We give too little honour to certain supporting actors. It is a rare artist who, in the tiny role of Moth, gives the most definitive performance in Love's Labour's Lost: which is precisely what Christopher Luscombe has been doing in the RSC's current production at Stratford. Likewise in The Merchant of Venice his Launcelot Gobbo is outstanding. Luscombe makes line after line register with new impact, and lends a sharper focus to every scene in which he belongs. Alas, the RSC is not the ensemble it once was. How come the company employs artists like Luscombe on the one hand, and certain desperately unready and misguided supporting actors on the other, is a puzzle. An altogether simpler pleasure may be had from watching Luscombe solo in Half Time, a one-man show he has co-devised with his fellow-actor Richard Bonneville, and which is currently being presented at the Donmar Warehouse, late night at weekends. The title Half Time is a multiple pun on the word 'half', for the show's first half occurs at a Cambridge college during an alumni reunion while the students are away (in 'the half'), and the second half occurs backstage while actors are preparing (in 'the half') before a performance of Hamlet. In 90 minutes, Luscombe plays nine characters, of both sexes and of all classes, making only the merest adjustments to his one basic outfit, perfectly gauging in every case the accent, vocal tone, and emotional lows and highs. Each character is presented as if talking to Luscombe himself; who plays all of them with a remarkable blend of malice and compassion. Take the Master's suave-voiced upper-class wife: 'You're our Thesbian' (sic) 'of the evening? . . . Have you got a job? . . . A proper job? . . . Done any television? . . . Have you met David Attenborough at all? . . . He was at prep school with the Master.' Awfully gracious, she is more dowdy and provincial than she knows. But it is her behaviour to her dog that is the real giveaway: it induces the only flash of real energy she ever shows. More in body language than in parlance, Luscombe invests this sourly condescending lady with a dash of real pathos and loneliness. And Luscombe reveals each character in physical as well as vocal terms. Wonderful how, as the slow and self-important old college porter, he creakily bends and kneels to find a register book (and then forgets to pick it up as he heaves himself up again). Or how, as the young actor ('Sexpot') who plays Rosencrantz and is having an affair with the cast's Gertrude, he carefully adjusts the ghastly little tuft of hair he has sticking out through a gap in the baseball cap. By such details, Luscombe brings to life more than just individual characters. You sense the atmospheres of different rooms, various relationships, and the mental climate of each milieu. Meanwhile each situation keeps getting funnier. Hamlet, apparently, is set in Art Deco scenery; and a voice over the tannoy says, 'Everyone get ready for the first court scene, please. Dancers, stand by for the charleston.' Meanwhile, the college's befuddled old senior tutor has arranged to see Jurassic Park a second time rather than suffer through the entertainment being presented to the alumni by - yes - Luscombe. Half Time: Donmar Warehouse, 11pm, Friday 4 and Saturday 5</p>

			<p><P> September 11, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> EFFORT TO HOLD DOLLAR DOWN FAILING  </P> <P> The effort by the United States and other top industrial countries to stabilize  the value of the dollar has broken down, running the risks of higher U.S. trade  deficits in future years, economists at a Washington research institute said  today.  </P> <P> "The coordination process is in shambles," said C. Fred Bergsten, director of  the Institute for International Economics.  </P> <P> He said the effort launched by the United States and the governments of Japan,  West Germany, Britain, France, Canada and Italy had failed to keep the dollar  from rising this year above the upper targets set by the world's richest  industrial countries.  </P> <P> That will spell trouble down the road as American exporters find that the  higher value of the dollar makes it more difficult to sell their goods abroad,  Bergsten said at a news conference.  </P></p>

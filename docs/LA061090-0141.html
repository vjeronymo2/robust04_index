			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAMES FLANIGAN: ROBERT NOYCE OR IVAN BOESKY? THE CHOICE IS REALLY OURS  </P> <P> "Bob Noyce changed your life."  </P> <P> That's how an electronics industry executive summed up the contribution of  Robert N. Noyce -- inventor of the integrated circuit, founder of Intel Corp.  and pioneer of the industrial phenomenon known as Silicon Valley -- who died a  week ago. Noyce, who was chairman of the government-industry electronics  consortium Sematech when he died of a heart attack at 62, exemplified enduring  values in American business -- and also reflected its current difficulties.  </P> <P> He stood in healthy contrast to the false prophets who dominated business news  in the last decade -- the likes of Ivan "Greed is Good" Boesky, Henry Kravis,  Michael Milken, T. Boone Pickens and Donald Trump -- as well as corporate  chieftains who took millions in salary and bonuses but delivered competitive  failure. It was a decade not of sowers but of reapers.  </P> <P> Noyce, by contrast, was a builder. A graduate of Iowa's Grinnell College and  the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he devised a way to cluster  electrical circuits on a wafer of silicon and thereby made possible small  computers, moon landings, automatic bank tellers, microwave ovens and a  thousand other transformations of our daily lives.  </P> <P> Moreover, he pioneered the modern entrepreneurial company. Noyce founded  Fairchild Semiconductor in 1958 -- when he was 30 -- and Intel in 1968. He  strove for a new kind of company based on individual effort rather than  corporate hierarchy. He called the process "empowering from below," and it  proved fruitful. Intel people developed the dynamic random access memory or  D-RAM, the most widely used microchip, and the microprocessor, or computer on a  chip.  </P> <P> In the 1960s and '70s, the Intel example inspired a wave of technological  start-ups, attracting venture capital to the personal computer industry, and  beyond to biotechnology and other frontiers.  </P> <P> Noyce, the son and grandson of Congregational ministers, showed that the best  career choice was to follow your dream.  </P> <P> But there's more to Noyce's legacy than past glories. Noyce also reflects the  challenge of global competition and poses the question, as he himself put it,  "of whether the U.S. financial system is suited to the development of advanced  technology to create the industries of the future."  </P> <P> Intel was bloodied in the 1980s by an assault on the memory chip market by  Japanese firms dumping low-priced chips to drive U.S. competitors from the  field. "The Japanese semiconductor industry blew $4 billion to get the D-RAM  business; we (the U.S. industry) blew $2 billion and gave up," said Noyce.  </P> <P> Intel was kept alive in 1983 by a $350-million investment from IBM -- which  Intel, now a $3-billion-sales company, later repaid.  </P> <P> But Noyce saw that the global market was a fight among nations more than  companies, and so he sought help for his industry in Washington.  </P> <P> For awhile he got results -- the Reagan Administration stopped Japanese dumping  with the semiconductor agreement of 1986.  </P> <P> However the Bush Administration lately turned cold to his ideas, holding that  market forces alone should decide the fate of U.S. companies. Government  shouldn't interfere. It's an attitude colored by years of government assistance  to the car and steel industries that has done little to benefit U.S. workers or  consumers.  </P> <P> But it's a mistaken attitude on advanced technology, says Alan Patricof, head  of a leading venture capital firm.  </P> <P> "Government has to seed technology because start-up costs are high, the payoff  is five years or more and capital isn't coming forward," says Patricof.  </P> <P> So there's a standoff, with neither government nor markets aiding U.S.  technology. Meanwhile, future jobs, opportunities and U.S. living standards are  left hanging in the balance.  </P> <P> Yet Noyce showed a way for government and industry to work together, with  Sematech, the 14-company consortium set up with a $200 million annual budget to  develop manufacturing techniques for advanced semiconductors. Sematech develops  know-how that can then be distributed to U.S. industry -- a pattern familiar in  Japan, where consortiums are widely used.  </P> <P> The point, of course, is to keep firms working and technology developing in the  United States -- because if companies drop out, know-how fades and the nation  forfeits further development. U.S. makers gave up on television sets, and lost  the videocassette recorder.  </P> <P> Now the Bush Administration says no seed money will be given to high-definition  television. That's unfortunate, says one expert, "because it's abdicating  spinoff products for the next decade."  </P> <P> What is being abdicated, as Noyce knew, is the profit -- both in money and  opportunity -- that comes from innovation. In money alone, Noyce's Intel  returned 50 times its original investment to early investors, such as his alma  mater, Grinnell College.  </P> <P> Yet the market didn't do it alone. Seed money for Noyce's early developments  came from the Gemini and Apollo space programs.  </P> <P> The truth is, left to itself the market's forces are as likely to give you an  Ivan Boesky as a Bob Noyce. If you want to control your own destiny, you have  to make choices.  </P></p>

			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Race-row pair reprieved The Liberal Democrat party was under fire from the Conservatives and Labour yesterday after plans to expel two London councillors, accused of racism, were dropped. An inquiry set up by the party last month recommended that the two Tower Hamlets councillors should be expelled for producing racist leaflets during a by-election won by the British National party. The councillors were reprieved after an appeal to the party's London region, which accepted their apologies. A third councillor involved resigned from the party. Mr Matthew Taylor, the Liberal Democrat campaigns chairman, said the decision was 'entirely consistent' with the appeal process envisaged by the inquiry report. He said the main author of the leaflets had given specific undertakings not to stand as a candidate or produce campaign leaflets in future. The Liberal Democrats also accused Labour of conducting a secret inquiry into racist campaigning in the borough by Labour candidates. 'Our procedures have been followed openly, and explicit action has been taken in line with the report. The contrast with the Labour party could not be greater,' Mr Taylor said. Mr Jack Straw, Labour's environment spokesman, said the decision not to expel the councillors was 'a major humiliation' for Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader. 'This whole exercise has now been exposed as a cynical whitewash,' Mr Straw said. 'I have no doubt that the London party acted as it did because it was petrified that any members expelled would blow the whistle on the complicity of senior members of the Tower Hamlets party about the use of the race card.' Mr Gerry Malone, deputy chairman of the Conservative party, said the decision showed that the Liberal Democrats were 'willing to say or do anything, however unscrupulous, to get elected'.</p>

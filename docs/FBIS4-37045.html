			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Baroda 10 June. Bharatiya Janata Party [BJP]  President L.K. Advani has said that India should develop nuclear  weapons and should not come under pressure from the United  States or world public opinion for the sake of the country's  unity, security, and integrity.    Addressing the three-day convention of the party's National  Council, Advani said that the United States speaks about nuclear  nonproliferation with the aim of having India subcontract its  national security to it and getting unhindered access to Indian  markets.    About 3,000 delegates from throughout the country are  attending the BJP National Council convention.    Advani said that Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao has come  under U.S. pressure. The national interests are being  compromised to please the United States. Commenting on the  government's statement in parliament on `Prithvi' and `Agni'  missiles, he said our self-prestige has come down to the extent  that we rush into apologizing at each hint of any U.S.  displeasure. He asked: "Whether India should surrender its  security interest to attract foreign investments?"    He spoke about the threats posed to India by the increasing  U.S. tilt toward Pakistan. He also cautioned the country  against the compromising stand of the Narasimha Rao government,  which is affecting national socioeconomic interests. He called  for the Rao government to be toppled. He said that the  Narasimha Rao government is ignoring the U.S. steps favoring  Pakistan's nuclear efforts and according the Most Favored Nation  status to China. It is a result of the government's wrong  policies that Pakistan through the Inter-Services Intelligence's  inspired terrorist violence and bomb explosions is waging a  proxy war. He added that these Pakistan efforts are part of  other wider designs, which can be much more dangerous,  especially if the government's response remains weak.    Advani said that foreign investment and world opinion have  importance, but to base decisions alone on them is tantamount to  abandoning the national interests. Nobody could imagine that  this country of 900 million would go begging in front of others.  He said India should act courageously and go nuclear. China  and Pakistan are already nuclear powers. In view of this, India  should not hesitate to acquire this capability. This will also  change the outlook of other countries toward India and we will  get our due place in the world.    Referring to Rao's recent visit to the United States, Advani  said he had abandoned national interests to please the United  States. Even the `Prithvi' missile tests had been postponed and  the prime minister had not felt even slightly embarrassed while  announcing this decision. Advani said that the most important  issue at this time is to acquire a respectable status for India  in the comity of nations, but the Narasimha Rao government is so  keen to weaken the country that any country is able to damn it.    Advani said the present government has not only failed to  deal with the international situation, it has also not resolved  domestic issues. The Kashmir situation is progressively  deteriorating. There is no let up in acts of terrorism and even  Jammu has become their target. He said that, due to the lack of  right policies and a unified command, the government has failed  to deal with terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir.    In his speech, Advani mainly targeted the prime minister and  his three-years of administration. He said he himself felt  embarrassed, recalling that he had once compared Narasimha Rao  to the late Lalbahadur Shastri.    Advani described it as very unfortunate that, by raising a  bogey of isolation, the government on the one hand is ruining  the country's economy, and on the other its zeal for increasing  foreign investment is even endangering national security. The  indiscriminate entry of multinationals in the name of  liberalization has threatened the very existence of the domestic  industry. Violence, criminality, and corruption have touched  extreme limits and scandal is synonymous with this government.  Advani said the government is bringing forward the so-called  electoral reforms bill to clip the wings of Chief Election  Commissioner T.N. Seshan, who is trying to root out corruption,  and to halt the growing strength of the Bharatiya Janata Party.  The party will oppose it at every stage. He said attempts made  to convert Rao's minority government into a majority one are not  hidden from anyone. Rao first divided Janata Dal, Telugu  Desam, Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, and Shiv Sena and later admitted  the dissident groups into the Congress-I by paying an  `appropriate price'. Advani said Rao even unsuccessfully tried  to divide the Congress-I ally Anna-Dravida Munnetra Kazagham.    The BJP president said that, as well as encouraging  defections, the present government also ranks first in  corruption. This government, which created all sorts of  obstacles for a probe into the Bofors gun deal, has also not  taken action against those involved in the securities scam.    He said he considers Narasimha Rao and the Congress-I  responsible for the current round of ethnic war and anarchy in  Uttar Pradesh following the assumption of power by the Bahujan  Samaj Party-Samajwadi Party coalition in the state; because of  the Congress-I support the state government has been formed  there.    Referring to the [Temple-Mosque] Ayodhya issue, the BJP  president said the construction of a Ram temple at the  birthplace of Lord Ram has become inevitable. This has been  accepted even by those who earlier opposed it. No one now talks  about reconstructing the Babri Mosque. Impressions have been  created for the last few months that the temple will be  constructed by a government trust and not by the Ramjanambhoomi  trust, but the people will never allow this to happen.

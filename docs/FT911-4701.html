			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / International Company News: Billiton incurs 35% fall BILLITON, which includes most of the mining and metals operations of the Royal Dutch/Shell group, suffered a 35 per cent fall in net income last year, from Dollars 262m in 1989 to Dollars 170m. The group said lower alumina and aluminium prices had a significant impact on the 1990 results. At the operating level aluminium profits fell by 65 per cent to Dollars 73m. Downstream operating profits fell by 80 per cent to Dollars 17m, reflecting prolonged start-up difficulties at Tiofine in the Netherlands and the impact of lower prices, reduced margins and stock write-downs at most other operations. Marketing and trading operating profits fell by 60 per cent to Dollars 26m. Exploration and mining operating profits rose by 33 per cent to Dollars 90m.</p>

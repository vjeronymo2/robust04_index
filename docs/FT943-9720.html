			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / International Company News: Disney joins 'Baby Bells' in interactive video pact Walt Disney, the US entertainment group, yesterday said it plans to form a joint venture with three regional telephone companies to provide consumers with traditional and interactive video programming in their homes. News of the alliance between Disney and the three 'Baby Bells' - Ameritech, BellSouth and Southwestern Bell - follows last month's decision by the Federal Communications Commission to allow Bell Atlantic, a local telephone operator, to provide cable TV and interactive video services to customers in its region. That decision was hailed as a breakthrough because it was the first time a telecommunications company had been allowed to offer cable and interactive programming services over its lines in competition with local cable television monopolies. At the time of the Bell Atlantic ruling, the FCC made clear that it would allow other telephone companies to compete with cable television groups. Telephone companies, however, are still forbidden in general from owning the content of television programming, which is why the three Baby Bells have joined forces with Disney. The entertainment group will provide the product  -including motion films, television shows and educational programmes - while the telephone companies will provide the means to deliver that product to consumers at home. According to the four partners, the services their venture will provide could ultimately include traditional broadcast and satellite television networks, movies-on-demand, interactive home shopping, educational programming, games and travel information and assistance. The venture will also develop a navigating system that will allow customers to access these services easily and quickly. Mr Michael Eisner, Disney's chairman, said of the project: 'Our goal is to use technological breakthroughs and new entertainment delivery systems to provide customers with a compelling and creative array of programming.'</p>

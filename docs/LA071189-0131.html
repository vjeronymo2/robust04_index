			<p><P> July 11, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> N.Y. LAW GIVES WOMEN TOILET PARITY  </P> <P> Women won equal rights in the restroom under a law signed today by Gov. Mario  M. Cuomo.  </P> <P> The law, dubbed the "Potty Parity" proposal, requires new buildings to have as  many toilets for women as they do for men. The measure, subject of sometimes  silly debate, passed the Legislature in June on a 140-1 vote.  </P> <P> The lone dissenter, Assemblyman Kemp Hannon, said women should have more  toilets than men because women take longer in the bathroom.  </P> <P> The law applies to any new building designed for public assembly and built  after June 1, 1990. The number of toilets in a women's room would have to equal  the number of urinals and toilet stalls in men's rooms.  </P></p>

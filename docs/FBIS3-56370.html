Turning back to the Russo-American summit in Moscow, he  noted  that its main task to hold it in the conditions of mature  partnership was completed. "The main sensation of the summit is  the absence of a sensation. We are proceeding to institutional  and systematic partnership," Kozyrev stressed.    In his opinion, the Moscow meeting marked a stage in the  development of smooth Russo-American trade. He singled out "the  uranium bargain" as supplementary to the space deal and said  that both contracts covered a long period (10-15years) and could  fetch billions in profit.    He noted that in Moscow the presidents also discussed  economic partnership. "In economics, partnership means  something other than a short-term credit or a portion of  humanitarian aid. It's day-to- day work to integrate markets in  international systems rather than to "patch up a hole." It  means negotiations with a long prospective and realization that  Russia is a great economic power. That's precisely what was  done at the Moscow summit, Kozyrev said.    He specifically stressed that "least of all" did he regard  the Russo-American-Ukrainian understandings as the chief result  of President Clinton's visit to Russia.    The agreements concerning the withdrawal of nuclear weapons  from Ukraine "are important, but they will bear fruit only  during their implementation. There is nothing new in these  accords," he said.    Kozyrev recalled the signing of similar accords with  Ukraine.  "At a CIS summit in Almaty two years ago, an agreement was  signed to oblige Ukraine to follow Belarus and Kazakhstan in  becoming a nuclear- free country and remove weapons... Then,  numerous meetings followed in Crimea, Moscow, Kiev, etc.  Interaction on this problem with Americans is nothing new  either since the Lisbon protocol was signed with U.S  participation."    Nonetheless, Kozyrev hopes that now when the accords are  fixed at the level of Russian, American, and Ukrainian  presidents, they will yield result. "All of us are full of  optimism. It would be strange, if the agreements, signed by the  presidents, remained on paper," he noted.</p>

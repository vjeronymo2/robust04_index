			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Grzegorz Kolodko, deputy prime minister and </F> finance minister, by Katarzyna Jedrzejewska and Piotr  Aleksandrowicz: "A Strategy for Poland;" date and place not  given]    [Excerpts] [RZECZPOSPOLITA] How high will inflation be  for the next four years?    [Kolodko] I am determined to shape the macroeconomic  proportions in such a way as to reach the level of single-digit  inflation in 1997. Thus, if in 1997 the yearly inflation  indicator were 9.6 percent, at the end of the same year  inflation would be even lower.    [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Is the starting point of your forecasts the  same as in this year's budget?    [Kolodko] It is practically the same. This year's budget  envisioned a 23.1-percent price increase from December 1993 to  December 1994; at the moment we are estimating this year's  inflation to be 23.6 percent. As far as the path of lowering  inflation is concerned: in 1995 the indicator would amount to  approximately 16 percent, in 1996 -- in the vicinity of 12  percent, and in 1997 -- less than 10 percent.    [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Will official prices rise at the same rate  as inflation? Will official prices still exist?    [Kolodko] We would like to decrease the scope of official  prices. As far as the rate of their increase is concerned, a  certain concession has already been made for those who want it  limited. This year we will be implementing the budget law  rather strictly. In the years to come, the energy prices will  be going up slightly more quickly than the overall inflation  rate; however, the process will be slower than was agreed with  the World Bank.    At this point I must make a more general remark. Reducing  inflation is not the final goal of the economic policy. In our  strategy lowering the inflation is an instrument necessary to  persuade people to save money. Thus, it is an instrument that  helps achieve investment growth as well as an increase in  productivity. Only in such a sequence -- as an effect -- can we  bring up the issue of real wage increases.    Another reason that lowering inflation is necessary is that  the budget must be made less tight as far as its expenditures  are concerned: the increase in expenditures must be controlled  and then the costs of paying off the public debt must be  reduced. Finally, the lowering of inflation means a slower  devaluation rate, as a result of which the budget expenditures  for paying off the foreign debt will be increasingly lower.    [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Right now the share of the public finances  in the Gross Domestic Product [GDP] is approximately 50 percent.  This indicator shows the degree of the redistribution. Is it  satisfactory, or should it be greater or rather smaller?    [Kolodko] It should be smaller and we are defining how it  should be lowered in the medium-term financial strategy. There  are fewer difficulties as far as receipts are concerned; there  are more difficulties concerning the expenditures. They are too  great, both if we look at the level of our development and from  the point of view of the market allocation of money, the  so-called transfers for the people. This is related to the  sphere of social benefits, which, even though small for  individuals, overwhelms the public finances with its burden.    At any rate, I believe that the budget is fulfilling the  function of redistribution to a degree that is too great;  therefore, in the "Strategy for Poland," we would like to limit  the redistribution by lowering the expenditures for the  transfers for the people, and by protecting the real level of  average wages and social benefits. This is possible.    [RZECZPOSPOLITA] With what, then, would you now start the  reforms?    [Kolodko] I would start them first of all by blocking the  process of the employees of various industry branches' gaining  further privileges, such as an earlier pension age, which we  have been witnessing for years, including very recently.    The problem is not that our benefits are too high; the real  problem is the fact that there are too many beneficiaries in  Poland. I am aware of the fact that the people will become the  beneficiaries of the reform of the system of social reforms and  insurances only after a longer period of time. However, if we  want to think about the public finances and plan certain things  a long time ahead, we must implement changes now. Our  government is prepared to take up this difficult challenge.    For me this planning means that in 2005, Poland must be in a  position to meet the Maastricht criterion which says that the  public debt should amount to approximately 60 percent of the GDP  at the most. There are no politicians among us who would think  along these lines. However, one must think this way. Today I  have made decisions, concerning the reduction of our foreign  debt, up to the year 2004. In the meantime, however, I often  have to make decisions "for yesterday."    [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Let us return to this year's budget. Is  the deficit going to be such as was included in this law, that  is, lower?    [Kolodko] I hope that it will be a little lower. We would  like to lower the size of the deficit from more than 6 percent  of the GDP in 1992 to less than 4 percent this year, and not  more than 2 percent in 1997.    [RZECZPOSPOLITA] How?    [Kolodko] Greater pressure is being placed on increasing  revenues; however, this should not be achieved through further  hardening of the state's fiscal policy, which is being --  probably unfairly -- criticized. It should rather be attained  through the completion of the construction of the taxation  system. Some issues are going to take as many as several years,  such as the cadastre and the new tax on immovable property. We  are considering gradual, quiet changes in the area of taxes on  capital-derived revenues; however, I do not think that this is  an issue of paramount importance. We are seriously treating the  slogan of absorbing the gray market and collecting overdue  taxes. [passage omitted]    [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Do you intend to exclude the National Bank  of Poland [NBP] from the financing of the budget deficit?    [Kolodko] NBP is my ally and my cooperation with Ms. Hanna  Gronkiewicz-Waltz is developing very well. The central bank  should try to minimize its share in the financing of the deficit  in the end; it should concentrate on the function of issuing and  be a modern central bank.    [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Do you think that the money supply should  be the same as the nominal GDP growth, slightly faster, or  slower? In other words, should the financial policy be stricter  or more expansive?    [Kolodko] I believe that the amount of money will be  increasing slightly faster than the nominal GDP.    First of all, I would like the central bank to see to it  that  the really positive interest rates are maintained. I expect it  to aim at lowering the cost of money and the discrepancy between  the interest rates of bank deposits and the interest rates of  credits. We have already made a serious step in this direction:  we have agreed that the reserves for bad credits be included by  banks in the costs of their activities, which decreases their  tax burdens. As a consequence, the cost of money decreases.  The activities of the central bank should not be guided by the  temporary needs of the government or of the finance minister: it  should be guided by the desire to perform the task of  stabilizing the money in the long run.    [RZECZPOSPOLITA] You said that the money supply should  increase faster than the GDP. What if the bank has a different  opinion on that?    [Kolodko] We should say this differently. The central bank  should shape the money supply in such a way as to proceed down  the roughly-defined path of limiting the inflation.    [RZECZPOSPOLITA] If it accepts it.    [Kolodko] I think that it accepts it... Second, the level  of the supply must be influenced by the problem of net  international reserves. This issue has not been settled. I  believe that the reserves should be maintained on more or less  the present level. An alternative to this is an increase.    [RZECZPOSPOLITA] In this way we have reached the issue of  the currency exchange rate. You said that you would readily  lower the rate of the creeping devaluation. In what way? Very  slowly, or faster, but perhaps with a leap devaluation, just as  it occurred last year?    [Kolodko] The scale of devaluation is a function of the  processes related to inflation, especially a function of the  increase in the prices of industrial products. On the other  hand, the scale of devaluation influences inflation through the  prices of imported goods, and especially through the  expectations concerning inflation. We want to carry out our  policy of a "creeping" devaluation in such a way as to prevent a  real appreciation of the zloty. The basket of currencies should  go up at more or less the same rate as the index of production  prices. I will not tell you how to do this because the finance  minister must not discuss certain matters. One can imagine a  process of decreasing the scale slowly, the so-called crawling  peg [preceding two words in English], or a process of decreasing  it more rapidly, along with a small corrective devaluation, by  three points for instance. I am saying this rather generally  because it should not be expected for the time being.    In the end -- I do not know whether this will be in 1997, a  year earlier, or a year later -- we would like to switch to a  floating rate which will be determined among banks.    [RZECZPOSPOLITA] What will become of the 6-percent import  tax which should be lifted this year?    [Kolodko] We will try to decrease it -- after arrangements  with our foreign and international partners -- by 1 percentage  point a year. Thus, it will disappear after some time.    [RZECZPOSPOLITA] What about the compensatory fees? Does the  lack of an executive order, necessary for their implementation,  result from the fact that you are against the fees?    [Kolodko] I believe that the scope of the compensatory fees  should be limited. They should be applied in situations when  there are clear characteristics of a dumping policy. They  should also go for products which are of fundamental importance  for the level of employment and for the level of revenues in the  Polish agriculture. Indeed, the final decisions have not yet  been made. However, the list of the products will be shorter  than might have been suggested in some press reports.    [RZECZPOSPOLITA] What is the greatest inflation increase,  caused by the compensatory fees, that you consider acceptable?    [Kolodko] I would not like to add more than half of 1  percentage point. Incidentally, the results of the introduction  of the compensatory fees have not been included in the  above-mentioned inflation estimate -- 23.6 percent.    [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Let us now discuss privatization. Is the  government going to present a uniform stand on the issue of  privatization within the next few months?    [Kolodko] You cannot see such a stand, then?    [RZECZPOSPOLITA] No, we cannot.    [Kolodko] If you cannot see it, then it will become clearer  because there are people who have clear views on this. I would  prefer concrete questions.    [RZECZPOSPOLITA] What about the privatization of banks? Is  the Industrial-Commercial Bank going to be privatized? Is a  fourth bank going to be selected for privatization this year?    [Kolodko] The first question, which we will answer as early  as June, is the following: Should this sector first be  consolidated, or privatized? Perhaps, then, the  Industrial-Commercial Bank will be privatized in a different  configuration, as a result of a consolidation process.  Increasingly more experts are saying that banks should first be  consolidated.    [RZECZPOSPOLITA] What about the privatization and the future  of the State Insurance Bureau [PZU]?    [Kolodko] We want to restructure the insurance sector in  such a way as to first of all weaken the monopolist position of  PZU.    [RZECZPOSPOLITA] A division, then?    [Kolodko] I would like to answer this question in two weeks'  time; however, I do not rule out the possibility that PZU will  be divided.    [RZECZPOSPOLITA] What is your evaluation of the program of  commercialization of state-owned enterprises?    [Kolodko] My views are similar to the views of Minister  Kaczmarek; I share his opinion that over 1,000 enterprises,  especially the bigger ones, should be quickly commercialized, so  that we will be able to lift the popiwek [tax on excessive wage  increases] at the end of this year.    We also want to establish the criteria for selecting the  enterprises that should be quickly privatized. On the other  hand, the parliament should define the areas of the economy  which will not be privatized in the foreseeable future.    [RZECZPOSPOLITA] The program of National Investment Funds  will be continued, of course, will it not?    [Kolodko] Yes, it will. One must run forward; this program  must be completed and looked upon as broadly as possible, even  though it does not entirely resolve either the problems of  ownership transformations, or the problem of running this  property.    [RZECZPOSPOLITA] What portion of the GDP and what portion of  the industrial production will come from the private sector in  1997, do you think?    [Kolodko] I do not know these figures and I am not  particularly excited by any forecasts in this area. However,  the private sector will certainly be developing faster than the  state- owned sector and the indicators of its share in  employment, production, and exports will be rising, due to the  faster growth rate of private companies, the influx of foreign  capital, and the denationalization processes. However, these  indicators will be changing in favor of the private sector less  rapidly than they have been changing in recent years, because a  revolution is carried out only once. You cannot double  something that already has over a 50- percent share in the  global indexes.    [RZECZPOSPOLITA] What do you think of the participation of  employees in privatization?    [Kolodko] My views on this are rather moderate. Not only  does it not guarantee greater efficiency, but it also decreases  budgetary receipts; moreover, it is unfair.    [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Why is it unfair?    [Kolodko] Because they put pressure on it and its  beneficiaries are only defined groups of employees of mostly  medium- sized enterprises. As a result, budget sphere  employees, senior citizens, inhabitants of rural areas, and  employees of enterprises which will still be owned by the state  for a long time, including many large enterprises, are left out  of the privatization process.    [RZECZPOSPOLITA] One of the restructurization and  privatization ideas would be the exchange of the Polish debt for  shares in Polish enterprises. Are any details known yet and  does the government unanimously approve of this idea?    [Kolodko] The answer is negative to both questions.  Generally, the thought is the following: the government's task,  resulting from the reasons of the state, is to also dispose of  some of the public debt while disposing of such a vast amount of  assets. Hence the support for the settlement procedure or, in  the future, the issuing of special public debt Treasury bonds  which may be exchanged for elements of the privatized property.  Some time in the future we would like to start buying out the  public debt and offer the privatized property, especially to  households. This will enrich our capital market. The second  aspect is of an international nature. If we successfully  finalize the reduction that has already been included in the  general agreement with the London Club -- and this process is  slowly but surely going on -- then I think that we should take  the second step and implement a bold program of exchanging part  of the remaining debt for shares in enterprises. I would like  for such transactions to be closely related with the inflow of  foreign capital from private sources; I would like them to be an  element of the packet which also includes cash investment and  (or) certain investment commitments for the future.    [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Investment or social commitments?    [Kolodko] I would prefer the former. It will create new  work places.    We want to kill three birds with one stone... I guess that  this is too much: decreasing the debt, privatization, and inflow  of direct investment enhancing the competitiveness of the Polish  economy. In this way these investments are supposed to be  advantageous to the Polish people, even though, of course, the  foreign capital will make its own business. I cannot see any  discrepancy here.    [RZECZPOSPOLITA] If the program is to yield considerable  profits, it must concern large and attractive companies --  refineries, telecommunications, insurance, perhaps airlines...    [Kolodko] That is right. In Argentina 20 percent of the  debt -- $10 billion -- was liquidated in this way. I can see no  reason why we should not try this in Poland. Also here we must  run forward and resist this pseudo-capitalist bla bla bla that  we will sell Poland out and give it away for half the price.  This is just not true.    [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Your projects seem to be rather  technocratic...    [Kolodko] They are pragmatic...    [RZECZPOSPOLITA] In the meantime, in one of your interviews  you said that you would like the GDP to be distributed more  justly. What does one have to do with the other and how do you  intend to achieve this justice?    [Kolodko] The process of transformation is related to  colossal redistribution and we touch upon this problem in almost  every question. This redistribution is done through the budget  or through the capital market, or it is transferred over  borders. The beneficiaries of this process are various social  groups and it will continue to be this way. Now, there is the  question: How to distribute the results of the increase in  productivity, the results of the growing GDP? We want to change  the relations of work and remuneration. I am determined to  depart from the chaotic, political, sick bidding system, which  is anti market.    I am certainly not a populist, I will not allow anyone to  put  such a label on me. However, I believe that right now there is  time for more social sensitivity. And I believe that it is in  the interest of the people if we change the relations of work  and the principles of remuneration. We cannot have a situation  in which bilateral negotiations are always conducted, even if  the problems are multidimensional. I am against transferring  all the decisions concerning wages to the central level. I am  in favor of deregulation and decentralization; I am also against  the idea of imposing the concept of a corporate state.    We will have the Trilateral Commission; it will be written  down in the law. However, it is supposed to be first of all a  place where the conflicting interests will be discussed; it will  be the forum of negotiations. It will certainly not decide  everything. The government is subordinated to the parliament and  to the president; it will certainly not be subordinated to the  Trilateral Commission.    Now, returning to your question, when we speak about social  justice, we do not say that we want to be good uncles and we  want to give away some of the budget money. On the contrary.  There is justice when the stronger are not allowed to take  money away from the weaker -- through strike pressure, for  instance. More just distribution is when it is those who work  hard that earn more money than those who strike hard, not vice  versa.</p>

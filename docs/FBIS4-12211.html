			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 5 Apr (INA)--Deputy Prime Minister Tariq  'Aziz today received a delegation from the Jordanian House of  Representatives headed by Deputy House Speaker 'Abd Musa  al-Nahar.    The deputy prime minister explained in detail the human  suffering and the [word indistinct] effect of the unfair  embargo, which certain tyrannical and domineering parties at the  UN Security Council seek to perpetuate, despite the fact that  Iraq has fulfilled its commitments, which obliges the UN  Security Council to lift the embargo clamped on Iraq in  fulfillment of its reciprocal obligations.    Tariq 'Aziz commended Jordan's courageous stands in support  of the Iraqi people, and urged parliamentarians as well as all  organizations and well-intentioned people in the world to  redouble their efforts to lift the unfair embargo clamped on the  Iraqi people.    For his part, the deputy speaker of the Jordanian House of  Representatives reiterated the Jordanian people's support for  and solidarity with the fraternal Iraqis. He commended the  Iraqis' steadfastness and firmness in their confrontation of the  aggression and in their handling of the unfair embargo.</p>

			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / International Company News: Berlitz accepts new offer from Fukutake THE PRICE of Berlitz shares rose by nearly 22 per cent yesterday morning after the US language school and publishing group said it had agreed to accept a revised and lower takeover offer from Fukutake, the Japanese publishing company. Fukutake, which will reduce the cash part of its payment from Dollars 21.62 to Dollars 19.50 per share, had asked for a renegotiation of its bid earlier this month after Berlitz reported a sharp decline in profits for the third quarter. The company's operating income for the quarter was Dollars 1.2m, down from Dollars 5.2m in the same period last year. Net income for the 1992 quarter tumbled by 88 per cent, to just Dollars 700,000. On Wall Street, the Berlitz share price jumped by Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars 21 at mid-session yesterday, above the actual amended offer price. One reason for this was that while shareholders will receive less cash, Berlitz's outstanding borrowings will be Dollars 115m rather than the Dollars 160m of the previous accord. As in the earlier deal, shareholders of Berlitz will still receive a 0.165 share of new common stock, together with contingent rights to receive a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of promissory notes issued by Maxwell Communication Corporation (MCC), which is currently operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. MCC has featured in the Berlitz saga because some 56.5 per cent of Berlitz stock was pledged to banks last year as collateral for loans made to the late Mr Robert Maxwell. These shares have been the subject of litigation. As in the earlier deal, Berlitz shareholders will end up with 33 per cent of the company and the Japanese buyer will own the majority 67 per cent stake.</p>

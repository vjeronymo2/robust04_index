			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Arts: Loyal audience returns - Max Loppert attends the Wigmore Hall reopening gala THE LONG days and nights of closure are done: the Wigmore Hall is back in action. In the last few days, as the date of the Gala Reopening Concert approached ever nearer, there have been outbursts of anticipatory excitement, in print and on the air - quite out of character with the normally sober, reticent demeanour of the loyal Wigmore audience. This audience embodies the most knowledgeable and un-glitzy aspects of London's 'serious music' public. For the past 16 months during the Hall's refurbishment it has been forced to behave like the Messiah sheep: 'gone astray, and turned everyone to his own way'. No wonder there has been a palpable air of disaffection and no wonder this is now being replaced by torrents of enthusiasm and joy. For no other hall in London offers soloists or chamber ensembles the same encouragement, in equal parts acoustical and atmospheric, to freely inspired performance; no other promotes the same intimacy of communication between executant and audience; and no other has developed a programming policy so intelligently balanced, so full of artistic nous, and - as a direct consequence - so assured about attracting and retaining the services of the international singing and playing elite. (Indeed, for a previously unknown or untried artist or ensemble, a successful Wigmore debut recital - such as the ones given by Olaf Baer in 1983, the Carmina Quartet in 1987, or Sergey Leiferkus in 1989 - often results in immediate access to that elite.) The auditorium has not been tampered with: that was never the aim of the refurbishment. The 550 seats; the plush red carpets; the mahogany surfaces; the air of Edwardian ease - all are untouched. The frieze in the cupola, an art nouveau allegory of Music breaking free of Materialism, has been restored to gleaming brightness; the wallpaper has been changed, the paint renewed. Yet, to the regular Wigmore-visitor, the opening minutes of Thursday's concert proved almost strange in their sense of reassuring familiarity. Soon it was as though no time at all had elapsed between July 1991 and November 1992, as though one had never been away at all. It is in the exterior areas that the changes have been made - the foyer and greatly expanded basement, with its enlarged cloakroom and toilet facilities and brand-new wine bar and restaurant. The classic Wigmore characteristics of the past were 'luxe, calme et volupte' in the concert-hall, and crush, traffic gridlock and spilled coffee and ice-cream in the foyer. The latter will now be considerably modified - though it must be recorded that on Thursday the coffee bar produced scenes of opera buffa chaos as staff struggled with an intractable till and a wildly dysfunctional espresso machine (they had only been allowed in for the first time that morning). The Gala concert (transmitted live on Radio 3) was a splash of festive fare, a brilliantly calculated and excellently achieved re-opening fanfare. Indeed, it concentrated into summary form what, under William Lyne's 26-year directorship, has come to betoken everything that is most enlightened about Wigmore Hall artistic planning. It was a 'Celebration of Shakespeare' programme - in song, and in the interleaved readings by Jill Balcon. Two pianists, Graham Johnson (newly appointed the hall's Song Advisor, and programme-deviser of the evening) and Geoffrey Parsons were in charge, superlative performance-masters both. In order to commence proceedings with the Vaughan Williams 16-voice Serenade (in a two-piano arrangement conducted by Matthew Best), Lyne, Johnson and Parsons had gathered for the occasion 16 of the many fine recital-singers - American, Austrian, French and Icelandic as well as British - with Wigmore links already established, albeit of different degree of duration. All need to be named: the sopranos Barbara Bonney, Margaret Price, Dawn Upshaw and Lillian Watson; the mezzos Felicity Palmer and Sarah Walker; the contralto Catherine Wyn-Rogers; the countertenor Derek Lee Ragin; the tenors John Mark Ainsley, Gunnar Gudbjornsson, Keith Lewis and Adrian Thompson; the baritones Wolfgang Holzmair, Kurt Ollman and Francois Le Roux; and the bass Alastair Miles. It was a programme of profuse pleasures - some familiar (Mr Ainsley ravishing in Schubert's 'Who is Sylvia?'), some rare (Finzi's 'Fear no more the heat o' the sun' sung with regal gravity by Miss Wyn-Rogers), some operatic (the Act 2 duet from Thomas's Hamlet, the Willow Song from Otello), some popular (Miss Palmer and Mr Ollman deliciously droll in numbers from Kiss Me Kate). Everything seemed to flow, in context no less than performance, from a common basis of artistic understanding; everyone caught up in it, audience no less than performers, seemed glad to be there, and glad to be alive.

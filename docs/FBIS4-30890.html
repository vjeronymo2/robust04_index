			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Vaclav Havel by Premysl Svora; </F> place and date not given: "Our Relations Will Never Be Standard  Ones"]    [Text] Czech Republic President Vaclav Havel arrives  today on a one-day working visit to the Slovak Republic. Apart  from holding talks with his Slovak counterpart, Michal Kovac, he  will also meet Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik, representatives  from nongovernment organizations, and a group of intellectuals.  He will visit the Society for Foreign Policy and, in the  evening, he will attend a theater performance of Cyrano de  Bergerac. Prior to his visit, Vaclav Havel granted an interview  to our daily.    [Svora] Mr. President, the Czech Republic is of late  becoming ever more distinct from the other postcommunist  countries. What do you think of this? Not so long ago, you  said that the term postcommunist country should no longer be  used....    [Havel] First of all, I would like to emphasize that, in the  statement you quoted, I was not insisting that the Czech  Republic be described differently from the other countries  convulsed by communism. This term should not be applied to any  of these countries. Of course, it depends on what we mean by  the term postcommunist country. I had in mind the period in  which communism had been overthrown, but in which not all of the  state's democratic and political structures had yet been  established. I meant that the aforementioned term should be  applied to this transitional period. If we perceive this word in  this way, then the time has come for us to stop using it. Free  elections have been held in all of these countries, political  parties have been formed, and democratic mechanisms have begun  to function normally. If, however, by the term postcommunist  country we mean countries in which there has been communism at  some time, then we may be described as postcommunist countries  for the next 100 years.    [Svora] All the same, the Czech Republic has -- in a certain  way -- become singled out from the transforming countries by its  economic results in particular....    [Havel] It is perhaps true that the macroeconomic indicators  are better in the Czech Republic than in other states. There  are various reasons for this. First and foremost, the Czech  lands have always been industrially more developed. This,  however, is not the only reason. It has also asserted rapid  economic transformation. The fact that the Czech Republic is  better off from an economic point of view should not have any  political consequences. I think that the principle of  solidarity should apply in the Central European region.    [Svora] Like Presidents Kovac and Walesa, you have indicated  more than once that you do not want to be merely an inactive  observer of political development. However, your activities  often meet with a lack of understanding on the part of the other  elements of power. How do you perceive the role of a president  in our geopolitical region?    [Havel] It ensues incontrovertibly from the constitutional  division of power in the state that each [element] enjoys a  differently enshrined form of jurisdiction and a different type  of legitimacy. This has its advantages. For example, when  there is a change in the government, the president comes to the  forefront and represents the continuity of power and so on.  There is a certain tension between prime ministers and  presidents in all countries, not just in ours. However, it is  perceived much more sensitively in view of the long absence of a  democratic system. The same thing holds true for all  presidents, however; they should not fulfill merely a ceremonial  function. In this case, the question would arise whether the  function of president could not be carried out concurrently, for  example, by the prime minister.    [Svora] The aforementioned triumvirate of presidents is also  linked by something else: They are in office more or less  without those with whom they had cooperated closely in the past.  Which of your former friends do you still have left?    [Havel] I am a conservative person. If someone is my  friend, then he remains a friend for life. It just so happens  with my friends from dissent that sometimes they are involved  more in political life, sometimes less. I meet with some often  and with others seldom; sometimes our views are similar, other  times they are not so similar. However, this should not -- and  does not -- alter the fact that we are still friends. Despite  the fact that I have little time, I meet with all sorts of  people, including my old friends. Every two weeks, I organize a  meeting with various personalities in the presidential Amalia  residence. Around 300 different people have already taken part  in them.    [Svora] You once said in an interview for the former SMENA  that you do not want to be a president-grave digger. Despite  this, you were the last Czechoslovak president. With the  passage of time, what is your assessment of the breakup of  Czechoslovakia?    [Havel] For many citizens in the Czech Republic, and also in  Slovakia, the breakup of the Federation came as a real blow.  They were used to a homeland that had a different dimension,  not only geographically, but also culturally and historically.  And, all of a sudden, this homeland diminished in size.  However, thanks to the decent way in which the breakup took  place, people have come to terms with it relatively well.    I resigned from my post as federal president for various  reasons. One of them was that I did not want to stand in the  way of a development that I saw as irreversible. And I had to.  Undoubtedly, I would have been faced with the task of signing  the official law on breaking up the state. How could a  president who had sworn his oath of office on the Czechoslovak  Constitution sign this law? It seemed to me that I would make  the situation easier for everyone if I resigned.    [Svora] The number of voices calling for standardized  Czech-Slovak relations is increasing in the Czech Republic. In  principle, apparently, there cannot be any difference between  Australia, Portugal, and Slovakia....    [Havel] I believe that order makes friends. We are two  states and we must have the basic attributes of statehood. We  have our ambassador in your country and you have your ambassador  in our country, we have a demarcated border, we have customs  officers, and so on. It is necessary to have these basic  attributes of statehood. This does not mean, however, that if we  have standard requirements, we also have to have standard  relations. We will always be linked to such an extent by our  common history and similar language that our mutual relations  will never be standard ones.    [Svora] What do you expect from today's visit to Slovakia?    [Havel] I am looking forward to my talks with President  Kovac. I am curious about his interpretation of the current  political situation in Slovakia prior to the early parliamentary  elections. I expect not only a further exchange of views on  various topics, but perhaps also an agreement on certain  standpoints and initiatives.</p>

			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: A red light on cheque clearing IF YOU find your bank account on the verge of going into the red, trying to remedy the situation with a quick injection of funds will often fail. The main barrier is the three-day clearing system through which the 10m cheques that are written every day in the UK are processed. This involves the physical movement of cheques transferred from the drawer's bank to the payee's bank. Assume, for example, that a customer with a Barclays account writes a cheque to his friend, who has an account with National Westminster. The friend pays in the cheque at his branch and it is sent that night, together with its credit slip, to NatWest's London clearing department. Overnight, the cheques are separated into those drawn on NatWest and those drawn on other banks. The latter, like the Barclays cheque, are sent to the Bankers Clearing House in Lombard Street, London, the following morning (day two). Those cheques drawn on NatWest are processed within the clearing department itself. The cheques and credits at the Bankers Clearing House are exchanged, processed and put into bags at the end of day two to be taken to the relevant branch of Barclays. When it arrives on day three, Barclays will theoretically examine the cheque to verify the signature and authenticity. In practice, banks rarely find this worthwhile if the cheque is for less than Pounds 1,000. The amount of the cheque would then be debited from the Barclays customer's account. However, it may not be until the following day (day four) that the payee finds he can draw on the credit at NatWest. The customer would have been better off paying the cheque into a branch other than his own - his account would then be credited on day three rather than day four. If you have more than one account, you might think it would be quicker to shift money from one to another in order to avoid going into the red. However, a cheque drawn on your branch will be debited on that day but would not be credited into your other account until day three. The money sits in the float of a bank as an 'uncleared effect'. Since it is estimated that there is some Pounds 10bn in uncleared effects, it is not surprising that 'the float has been a basic source of banking income,' according to Richard Tyson-Davies, head of public affairs at the Association for Payment Clearing Systems (APACS) the umbrella body for the industry. Trying to shore up your account with cash can be just as ineffective unless you can pay it into your own branch. A reader complains of Barclays that 'when you pay in cash to a branch other than your own, it takes two working days before you receive credit to your account. While I realise cheques have to be cleared, cash does not.' Barclays is not the exception but the rule. The other three of the Big Four, Midland, Lloyds and National Westminster, all take two to three to clear cash if it is paid into a branch other than the customer's. Midland says that its system does not distinguish between cash and cheque credits. Barclays, while arguing that its clearing system does differentiate, 'is still unable to give same day value for deposits made at branches away from the main account.' The bank says that when cash is paid in at a branch other than the account holder's, a credit slip has to be filled in and this then runs through the same three day clearing cycle as a cheque. A same day service is available - but for a charge of Pounds 10 per transaction. 'These days few people pay in cash,' said a spokesman for Barclays, 'and the majority of those that do, pay in to their own branch.' Those customers who disagree may like to know that of the banks, TSB and Abbey National will credit your account immediately wherever a cash deposit is made. Both use an on-line real-time system which makes available customer details through a centralised computer. By contrast, traditional banks operate through a branch network rather than through a central system. The downside is that cash debits from your account are made just as quickly. Girobank also provides a quicker paying in service for cash. Cash deposits are recorded in the Post Office and are sent in an overnight pouch to Girobank's processing centre at Bootle, Merseyside. Your account will be credited the next day. NatWest says that many people erroneously assume that cash is worth more to a bank than a cheque. 'Cash is not worth anything when it is paid in unless we can use it,' said a spokesman for the bank. 'It takes 2 1/2 days for the bank to get value from cash - we would have to make a commercial decision whether to give value to the customer rather than to ourselves.' TSB acknowledges that it developed its system out of necessity when it was a savings bank. Depositors could not be overdrawn and the bank needed a computerised system to keep track of their balances. 'We think it brings tremendous benefits to our customers,' said the bank. Most building societies also operate an on-line service that allows them to credit and debit cash immediately, although cheques go through a slower process. Since few building societies are clearers, they use the services of one of the clearing banks. Practice varies between building societies but many take 10 days before allowing you to draw on funds deposited by cheque on investment accounts, although interest will often start accruing on the amount from the night it is paid in. The Clearing System Day One Customer at Bank A pays into his account a cheque drawn on bank B. Cheques for customers at that branch of Bank A are retained, as are cheques encashed at that branch. Other cheques are sent at the end of the day to Bank A's London Clearing Department. Cheques are divided overnight into those drawn on Bank A and those drawn on other banks. The latter are sorted into bundles for the other banks. Day Two Cheques and credits drawn on other banks are sent in the morning to the Bankers Clearing House in Lombard Street, London. The sorted bundles are exchanged, processed at the Clearing House and sent to the branches concerned. Day Three Bank B receives the cheque, verifies its authenticity and debits the account.</p>

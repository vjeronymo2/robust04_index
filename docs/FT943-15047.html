			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Brown offers plan to save Rosyth base Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, yesterday sent Mr John Major, the prime minister, a last-minute plan which he said would enable the threatened Rosyth naval base in Fife to survive and also save money for the government. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, is believed to be poised to announce a further rundown or even closure of the base on the Firth of Forth when he reveals the results of the latest defence review, probably on Thursday. The possibility of the base closing has produced vigorous opposition from MPs of all parties, as well as from trade unions and local government representatives in Scotland. Mr Brown, whose Dunfermline East constituency includes the base, proposes that the navy locates all minesweeping activities there. This would entail moving one squadron of six minesweepers and their support services from Portsmouth to Rosyth, instead of transferring two squadrons of 12 ships from Rosyth to Portsmouth, as defenders of the base believe is intended. Mr Brown said he had devised his plan using 'detailed inside knowledge' and 'meticulously gathered expert information', including two internal navy reports which support the case for retaining Rosyth. He said the annual extra cost of keeping the base open had been wrongly costed by the Ministry of Defence at Pounds 10m but was in reality Pounds 6.7m. That could be turned into a net saving of Pounds 4m: locating all minesweeping activity at Rosyth would save Pounds 2m and concentrating other minesweeping services would cut Pounds 1.5m. Some amalgamation of existing facilities could be achieved, saving up to Pounds 4m, and marine service support at Rosyth would be directed to the base itself at a saving of Pounds 3m. There would be some job losses among the 1,300 civilian and 1,800 naval personnel numbers to which the base will be reduced by next April, but these would not be 'considerable'. He said none of the minesweeper support, fishery protection work and North Sea oil strategic support functions which the naval base performs was 'the victim of the post-cold war changes in military requirements'. He said the government wanted to close Rosyth both because the base was disliked by MoD personnel and because its priority was to protect defence jobs in southern England. Mr Rifkind, who was visiting the Faslane submarine base on the Clyde yesterday, hinted at a slightly enhanced role for Faslane. He said the decision on Rosyth would be made 'in a sensitive, thoughtful fashion'.</p>

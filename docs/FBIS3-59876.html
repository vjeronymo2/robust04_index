			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mazhar 'Arif: "Economic Ideas"] </F>   [Text] We must admit to ourselves, at least, that the  government does not have a magical solution to the problems  which, we all agree, have been caused by the sanctions. The  philosopher's stone, never found throughout history, is still  nonexistent as we and the world stand on the threshold of the  21st century.    The sanctions, however, do not mean that there are no means  for a domestic struggle against its economic and  social effects on the people and the nation, by focusing on  agricultural production to provide the people's power and  organize ration cards to put Iraq's house in order despite the  political and economic conditions imposed on Iraq.    [This could be done by] restoring life to the destroyed  laboratories and factories and relying on the private commercial  sector, especially to get the wheels of society moving for  citizens as far as possible, if not to the point of providing  all the necessities for a dignified life for citizens and  achieving total comfort for the people in their present  circumstances.    All the measures and actions, as is well known, were  accompanied by other measures and resolutions some of which have  continued for the past few years, some of which were amended,  with still others subsequently abandoned for various reasons.    We do not want to keep talking about matters that have  become  facts of life for the people, because it is all already well  known. But we do just want to allude to the fact that the  sanctions have been used, by and large, as a peg upon which all  the problems that existed before the sanctions have been hung,  and these problems have thus been aggravated. We point this out,  though some of us have fallen into the sanctions trap. Its  resolutions have come on the basis of the interpretation and the  proposition used by those directly responsible, reaching its  higher authority in the office, institution, and ministry,  mistakenly, not well studied, and in constant need of balance.    We all know about the prices of domestic products, which  have  risen several times higher than their imported counterparts,  before they were banned, even though the purpose was completely  otherwise. Arab and non-Arab visitors paying in dollars at big  hotels and other places, the sale of productive factories and  state farms before the sanctions themselves, to individuals and  the private sector, and the entry of ministries and institutions  into dollar purchases from the market in one day, changed the  distribution of the process among these parties waiting for  days, weeks, and months, freeing large, well-known families and  major merchants to speculate in dollars. This went on until  price rises continued in line with dollar rates, then kept  rising despite drops in the rate of the dollar at certain times,  resulting in what might be described as the dinar's secession  from the dollar.    The withdrawal of the government from dollar-buying  operations was an appropriate decision. Even so, the process  remained the province of major merchants and rich and merchant  families, who ruled by the dollar in the name of breaking the  economic sanctions.    Is the Central Bank capable of intervening to regulate  dollar  rates? Is it possible for the government to establish a large  financial institution, under current conditions, to buy dollars  when needed and maintain the market price?    Perhaps the Central Bank has a limited opportunity to  intervene by way of foreign exchange. However, the question of a  financial institution at present is beyond the government's  powers, because of the sanctions, the ban on exporting oil, and  Iraq's frozen assets abroad. Achieving this now is not possible,  though, unless we were to rely on domestic lending from private  banks, industrialists, and merchants in exchange for certain  concessions, guarantees, and facilities.    The conversion of governmental industrial companies into  joint stock cement and brick companies played a part in driving  up the price of the dollar.    The citizens' interest in buying shares seemed to be greater  than their interest in supplying goods to market, and this, too,  sent prices up. The people--non-merchants--were surprised at  what the media was saying about purchasing dollars in the long  term without prior assessment of the harmful effects of this  kind of media presentation.    There are possible solutions which, in my view, must be  mentioned in this article. In brief: reviewing the distribution  outlets for goods to citizens; a ban on hoarding and realizing  profits based on hoarding; and enacting punishment as severe as  execution for that, as happens in capitalistic America itself,  and other countries. And on top of that, the cancellation of  agents' security, as occurs with cigarettes, and subjecting  domestic production to ration cards on the basis of "taking  turns" for the regions. This would influence prices and reassure  citizens that they can get batteries, tires, cloth, leather  products, oils, and other goods and commodities at one time or  another during the year. What might really cause surprise on  this subject is the appearance of what might be called the  secret purchase of a certain commodity in a company or  institution, and the purchase of rebate receipts for cement, for  example, on the part of some people afflicted with monopoly  fever.    Turning the central markets and social cooperatives into a  mixed sector may seem to be an acceptable idea because it will  give citizens a better chance to obtain various goods and  commodities at prices that, whatever they were, would still be  far below market prices.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Manila, May 16 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and the  Philippines will sign a memorandum on defense industry  cooperation in Manila next week allowing Seoul to sell or donate  used jet fighters, tanks and artillery, South Korean Embassy  officials said Monday.    Vice Defense Minister Chong Chun-ho will visit Manila from  May 23-27 and sign the memorandum on May 24 with Filipino  Undersecretary for Defense Feliciano Gacis, the officials said.    The agreement is the first of its kind that Seoul has signed  with a member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations  (ASEAN). Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, here on the first leg of  his Southeast Asian tour, proposed that South Korea and the  Philippines establish a "special partnership" to bolster  civilian links in the economic and social sectors as well.    South Korea already sold 12 naval patrol boats to the  Philippines in May last year at a cut-rate 100 U.S. dollars  apiece, paving the way for talks on overall defense industry  cooperation, the officials said.    According to the memorandum, the two countries will form a  defense industry cooperation committee which will meet once a  year alternately in each other's capital.    Details of the date and place for the upcoming meeting will  be decided at next week's vice-ministerial talks.    The majority of the military equipment that South Korea can  hand over to the Philippines is of U.S. origin, and Seoul must  therefore obtain Washington's approval before this materiel can  be transferred to manila, officials explained.    The equipment would include F5-A jet fighters and tanks as  well as munitions, they said.</p>

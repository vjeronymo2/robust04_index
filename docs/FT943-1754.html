			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / International Company News: A long haul for Credit Lyonnais  -David Buchan explains why the heavy losses will continue There is still light at the end of the tunnel for Credit Lyonnais, Mr Jean Peyrelevade believes, but the tunnel is proving far longer than he thought when he took over as chairman of the state-controlled bank nearly a year ago. Credit Lyonnais will today announce a hefty first-half net loss after provisions. Last year the bank reported a full year loss of FFr6.9bn (Dollars 1.3bn). In the first six months of 1994, Credit Lyonnais suffered from the decline in the demand for bank loans by France's cash-rich companies, but also saw its profits from trading on more depressed capital markets fall sharply. At the same time, Credit Lyonnais still reckons it must maintain a high level of provisions throughout this year to clean up its messy past. One result is an inevitable delay to the further capital increase that Credit Lyonnais needs, beyond the FFr4.9bn that it got in July from the state, the state-owned Thomson electronics group and the Caisse des Depots bank, which together make up 80 per cent of its capital. At 8.3 per cent, Credit Lyonnais's solvency ratio is in need of further strengthening. Committed to public spending rigour, the Balladur government has no means to buttress the bank's capital any further, and has told Credit Lyonnais that it can tap the stock market any time before the full privatisation expected in the late 1990s. But realistically, the bank realises it has no chance of attracting investors until next year, when it hopes for strong expansion in the French economy and the start of the turnaround in its own finances. Provisions against bad risks and loans are clearly the main millstone around the neck of Credit Lyonnais. For last year, Mr Peyrelevade set aside a total of FFr17.8bn, with just over half of this considered normal provisions on 'current' banking business and the rest 'exceptional' measures to compensate for precautions which the previous regime of Mr Jean-Yves Haberer should have taken earlier, particularly in non-traditional banking activities such as investments in industry, property development and cinema. It is clear, however, that both categories of provision will remain high this year. The bank says this is not because it has uncovered any new real horrors, but is mainly because its branch managers have decided to take advantage of the 'big sweep-out' to make a clean breast of all past problems as well as to be far more cautious on new business. This has been welcomed, even encouraged, by the bank's new auditors. By contrast, the French Treasury has not been totally enthusiastic about continued high provisions, wiping out hope of any dividend for the state and maintaining the question mark over how it let Credit Lyonnais get into such bad shape in the first place. But after a parliamentary inquiry's critical conclusions about their competence, or lack of it, the Treasury has been ill-placed to oppose Mr Peyrelevade's stringency. This stringency has uncovered further problems, and need for provisions, in the group's Althus and Societe de Banque Occidentale (SDBO) subsidiaries. It was the proud boast of the high-rolling Mr Jean-Francois Henin that when he ran Althus from 1990-93 he multiplied its balance sheet many times over but never increased its staff. The upshot was a chaotic back office, out of which dubious dossiers are still emerging. SDBO was the vehicle for loans to Mr Bernard Tapie. After all the fuss it made in mortgaging and eventually seizing the politician-tycoon's valuables, Credit Lyonnais has discovered this summer that Mr Tapie's art and furniture are only worth perhaps a tenth of the FFr350m the bank was counting on. The one shaft of light penetrating the tunnel so far is that growth in the group's operating costs and depreciation which was 4.1 per cent last year has been kept close to zero this year. Mr Peyrelevade has frozen his own salary and those of his top two dozen lieutenants, and is cutting 1,100 banking jobs in France and a further 900 in Europe over the current year. This is part of the two-pronged strategy to: Improve profitability and efficiency in the core banking business. Measures already announced include closure of some UK retail branches to focus more on corporate banking and market trading there, and new centralised management of European banking and foreign exchange trading worldwide. Sell FFr20bn worth of non-core industrial participations in 1994-95. This programme is on track, and so far FFr6bn worth of assets have been sold. They include big stakes in the Fnac record and book chain, the UAF life insurance company (with Credit Lyonnais still retaining the majority), the Essilor spectacle lens company, and the TF1 television station. Credit Lyonnais is now said to want to sell its 10 per cent stake in the Meridien hotel chain to Forte, the UK group which is buying control of Meridien from Air France. Even though the eventual plan is for Credit Lyonnais to keep some FFr30bn worth of industrial holdings, for the moment 'anything that is outside banking is, in principle, sellable,' says one bank executive.</p>

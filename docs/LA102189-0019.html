On Sunday, the first-game losers will play at 4:30;  the winners at 7:30.  </P> <P> Winners of their six exhibition games this season, the Lakers will be without  forward Orlando Woolridge, out for at least three weeks after arthroscopic  surgery to remove bone fragments from his right knee. Also, reserve center Mark  McNamara was given permission to miss practice Friday so he could return to  Santa Cruz and assess the earthquake damage to his off-season home. It is not  known when McNamara will rejoin the team. SAM McMANIS  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> CARNIVAL '90 AT PALLADIUM EVOKES THE SPIRIT OF RIO  </P> <P> It wasn't exactly Rio, but it wasn't bad. The Brazil Carnival '90 Mardi Gras  celebration at the Palladium had much of the ambiance, the color and the fun of  Tuesday's season-changing festival in Brazil.  </P> <P> The evening succeeded, in large measure, for two reasons: the first American  performance of an electrifying Brazilian singer named Baby Consuelo, and the  sheer enthusiasm of a crowd that seemed determined to live it up -- no matter  what.  </P> <P> Consuelo has everything it takes to become a major international singing star.  Slender and attractive, she was a virtual caldron of energy, moving restlessly  across the stage with the fire and fury of a Latin Janis Joplin.  </P> <P> Consuelo's singing, always strikingly rhythmic, always right on the mark, had  the kind of uplifting charge characteristic of Al Jarreau's finest efforts. And  her work with the band -- which was led by the guitar-playing husband of her  six children -- sizzled with the musical interactivity of a U2.  </P> <P> Aside from Consuelo's sparkling singing, however, the music moved in fits and  starts throughout a lengthy, erratic program. The Embrasamba All-Stars and Viva  Brazil provided solid, if unspectacular rhythms for the dancing crowd. But the  subtle beauty of samba singer Joao Nogueira's music was largely defeated by the  clatter and blur of the sound system.  </P> <P> In the final analysis, it was the audience who provided the evening's most  celebratory moments, especially during a vibrant costume contest. Once the  predictable Playboy bunnies, French maids and Mickey Mice were passed, the  finalists' outfits -- shimmering with sequins, beads, feathers and huge  headdresses -- gave Carnival '90 its closest connection with the magic and  fantasy of Brazil's original festival.DON HECKMAN  </P></p>

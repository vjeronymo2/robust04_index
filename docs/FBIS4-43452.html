			<p>BFN     [Text] Government Spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis today  stressed explicitly that Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas did  not accept the 21 March UN document on the confidence-building  measures. Kasoulidhis said Denktas' claims, that he has given a  positive answer on all points raised by the United Nations, are  strictly his own personal evaluation. He said: Things will  clear up after the UN Security Council's additional briefing by  UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali.    The spokesman added that if any change to the 21 March UN  document would benefit either side, it would make the compromise  unfair and unbalanced. He said: The March proposals constitute  a compromise that the United Nations has described as fair and  balanced.    The spokesman was replying to a statement by U.S. State  Department Spokesman Michael McCurry, that the current pursuit  is to combine the Greek Cypriot views, which have accepted the  March proposals, and the Turkish Cypriot views, which have  accepted a variation. Kasoulidhis noted that the March  proposals do not conform to the positions of the Greek Cypriot  side so there is no issue of merging with those issues that the  Turkish Cypriot side have accepted in June.</p>

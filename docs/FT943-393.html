			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Cattle's Pounds 28m call to buy consumer credit provider Cattle's (Holdings) is to expand its consumer credit operations with the acquisition of Welcome Group from London and Manchester, the financial services company, for a consideration of up to Pounds 27.4m The deal is to be financed by a 2-for-9 rights issue at 118p a share, which will raise about Pounds 27.9m. Cattle's shares closed down 7p at 135p yesterday. Welcome provides monthly credit facilities, mostly unsecured personal loans and hire purchase agreements. It has a 39-strong branch network, concentrated in the Midlands and north of England, and a customer base of about 33,000. Cattle's main source of revenue, Shopacheck, makes smaller unsecured loans and product sales, with repayments made weekly to an army of door-to-door sales staff. There are also marked differences in the rate of interest charged by the two companies, with Welcome's rate anywhere between 20 and 50 per cent and Cattle's more than 50 per cent, although the company pointed out that its rates usually included administration and other fees. Mr Edward Cran, Cattle's chief executive, said that Welcome would benefit from the 44,000 customers who used Cattle's own monthly credit facility, Shopaplan, which is run out of small retail out-lets. He added that the co-operation between the group and London and Manchester, in which they have used each other's customers as leads for new business, would be developed. Cattle's is paying an initial Pounds 21.4m for Welcome. A further Pounds 2.5m is to be paid after three years, with an additional Pounds 3.5m depending on the level of investment return generated by Welcome by the end of 1996. Welcome, which started trading five years ago, turned pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.43m in 1991 into profits of Pounds 1.57m last year. Turnover nearly tripled in that time from Pounds 15.7m to Pounds 45.53m. Mr Cran said the deal would be earnings neutral in 1995. Analysts, who have pencilled in pre-tax profits of about Pounds 26.5m for Cattle's in 1995, said that it would require some Pounds 4m of profits from the new division and a further Pounds 1m from Cattle's other recent purch-ase, Reedham, an invoice factoring company, for that to happen. Mr Cran, who said that current trading in both the Shopacheck business and the two new acquisitions was at record levels, asserted: 'There should be no problem whatsoever in achieving those kind of returns.'</p>

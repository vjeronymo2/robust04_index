			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / British Steel may cut shifts BRITISH STEEL is considering extending Christmas holidays in its strip division to reduce production, Catherine Milton writes. However, the company emphasised that a final decision had not been taken, refusing to disclose how many of its 3,000 workers at the Llanwern strip production plant worked 15 shifts a week rather than the usual 21. British Steel, one of Europe's most efficient steelmakers, said it would not rule out redundancies. It said it might temporarily halt shifts attracting premium pay, such as those during unsocial hours. British Steel could not say how many workers faced short-time working and extended Christmas holidays. Market conditions were 'changing all the time' and not all workers were likely to be affected in the same way. British Steel said last week it would cut production of liquid steel by as much as 20 per cent in the present quarter because of a decline in the demand for steel products in the UK and in export markets. The company said in June that the workforce would be cut to below 42,000 by the end of the current fiscal year from 44,800 at the end of March.</p>

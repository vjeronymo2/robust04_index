			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, May 25 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav Prime Minister  Radoje Kontic said on Wednesday [25 May] that the further  maintenance of the U.N. sanctions against Yugoslavia was not  conducive to a peaceful settlement of the crisis in the  territory of the former Yugoslavia, because they encouraged the  Bosnian Moslems to continue waging a war. According to  international law, the introduction of the sanctions was  illegitimate and contrary to the humanitarian law, discrediting  the United Nations, Radoje Kontic told domestic and foreign  journalists from 22 countries, who participated in the  international conference on a new world order and mass  communications in Budva, Montenegro, from May 20-22.    Ever increasing announcements on unilateral lifting of the  U.N. sanctions by Yugoslavia's neighbouring countries and  traditional economic partners, which suffer great  blockade-induced losses, also discredit the world organization,  Kontic said. The United Nations in May 1992 imposed  comprehensive sanctions against Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro)  for its alleged involvement in the civil war in the former  Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina (BIH). Kontic said that  Yugoslav government accepted and appreciated every peace  initiative which equally treated all three sides in the civil  war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and those settlements which respected  interests of all the three warring peoples.    Efforts towards achieving a permanent ceasefire and signing  a  peace agreement would have to include lifting or, at least,  easing the sanctions against Yugoslavia, because this is also  part of the peace process, Kontic said. Kontic conveyed  Yugoslavia's stand towards a political settlement of crisis in  relations between Croatia and the Republic of Serb Krajina  (R.S.K.), which envisages a cessation of hostilities, gradual  strengthening of broken economic and other ties between the  warring sides, and, in the end, a political settlement of their  mutual relations.    The Croatian side, due to a split within Croatia's ruling  party and its other internal problems, has lately showed signs  of impatience and nervousness, Kontic said and warned about  unacceptable setting of conditions and prejudiced peace  settlements imposed by Croatia. Speaking about the Yugoslav  programme of economic revival of the country, Kontic assessed it  to be in many aspects unique in the world, because it is the  first time that the economy is being reinvigorated under the  conditions of rigid sanctions and in isolation from favourable  affects by the world market.    The Yugoslav Federation, comprising Serbia and Montenegro,  is  for the open market economy. Yugoslavia will pursue an  independent foreign policy in the next period and will link it  neither to NATO, nor to any other military alliance, Kontic  answered a journalist's question. In explaining the status of  Yugoslavia in the Nonaligned Movement, Kontic said that  Yugoslavia was still a member of the movement and that it had so  far been invited to all meetings. He stressed that after  Indonesia had begun to chair the movement, Yugoslavia was not  invited to the ministerial conference being held in Cairo.    Indonesia has openly sided with the Bosnian Moslems and  against the Serbs in the civil war in Bosnia. The Egyptian  foreign minister in Cairo tried to accuse Yugoslavia of being  involved in the Bosnian conflict and to expel it from the  movement which was cofounded by Yugoslavia.</p>

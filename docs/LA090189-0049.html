			<p><P> September 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME TECH: THE LASER BIN;  </P> <P> FELLINI'S 'LA STRADA' CLASSIC REPRODUCED IN ITALIAN AND ENGLISH  </P> <P> "La Strada." Criterion, Extended Play CLV, 94 minutes, $39.95.  </P> <P> Federico Fellini's classic film starring Anthony Quinn and Giuletta Masina has  been reproduced on videotape for many years. But this laser disc edition  reproduces the film experience like no other medium: the black-and-white  picture is sharp and true and there are two clear audio tracks. The first  offers the movie in its original Italian language; the second offers the  English dubbing version. Subtitles are included as well. This way "La Strada,"  one of the great Italian classics, can be viewed as originally intended by the  director in its original language or, for convenience, in its dubbed version.  It's the way foreign films should be presented to the English-speaking public.  BARBARA SALTZMAN  </P></p>

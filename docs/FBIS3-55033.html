Men in Tbilisi Abstain  From Comment"]    [Text] Russia has ended its economic blockade of Abkhazia.  As has been explained to your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent  at the Russian Foreign Ministry CIS Department, Moscow's  decision is the result of the following considerations: The  leaders of Abkhazia have been of late demonstrating their  readiness for a dialogue with Tbilisi and taking specific steps  toward a peaceful settlement of the situation in the conflict  zone. Besides, it is primarily civilians, including Russians,  who are suffering from the blockade. In the opinion of Russian  diplomats, the lifting of the blockade shortly before the new  year will be assessed as Moscow's goodwill gesture and will  contribute to the stabilization of the situation in the region.    From the point of view of Abkhaz leader Vladislav Ardzinba,  Russia's blockade of Abkhazia contravened the Geneva agreement  signed by Moscow. (One of the items in the document says: "The  sides appeal to the international community for assistance in  restoring the life-support systems in the zone of conflict....")    The problem, however, has a reverse side too. Russia, as a  guarantor of the Sochi agreement, is responsible for any  violation of the understandings by the Abkhaz side.  Significantly, in his interview for your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA  correspondent, Andrey Kozyrev did not deny facts attesting to  Russian Army help to the Abkhaz people. The blockade of  Abkhazia demonstrated to the world community, albeit not too  convincingly, that Moscow condemned the violators of the Sochi  agreement. The lifting of the blockade in effect consolidates  the victory for Abkhaz military formations and, as a  consequence, will lead to even an greater anti-Russian mood in  Georgia. True, at this stage, as your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA  correspondent was told at the Georgian Embassy, Tbilisi  officials refrain from assessing the event.    Also rather interesting is the fact that Moscow has made up  its mind to lift the blockade despite the fact that there was  after all no real progress in the settlement of the Abkhaz  crisis. NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA has already reported (21 December  1993) that the problem of refugees from Abkhazia had been the  main stumbling block in the talks between Tbilisi and Gudauta:  the Abkhaz side insists that the republic's status be  determined in a referendum. Today, as an overwhelming majority  of Georgians have left Abkhazia, a referendum, according to  Tbilisi, will not be legitimate. As Vladislav Ardzinba stated  in an interview with your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent, the  republic's leaders today cannot guarantee the safety of Georgian  refugees who would like to return, hence the question of the  republic's status is being shelved once again. Also, your  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent, who has just returned from  Abkhazia, can testify that the remaining Georgian population in  the republic is continuing to be plundered.    Moscow's position would have been explicable had it rejected  the blockade idea right away on the grounds that it was  unwilling to punish innocent civilians. As for Moscow's present  decision, there may be only two explanations: Either Russia has  realized it made yet another mistake, or the decision to  institute economic sanctions had been no more than a trick aimed  at pacifying the world community.</p>

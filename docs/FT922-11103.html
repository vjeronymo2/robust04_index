			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / UK Company News: Better second half helps limit fall at Moss Bros to Pounds 1.32m MOSS BROS, the menswear retailer and hire chain, yesterday announced slightly better-than-expected profits and said improved margins and cost controls helped it weather recession in the high street. Pre-tax profits fell to Pounds 1.32m (Pounds 2.39m) in the year to January 25. This followed a poor first-half performance when interim profits fell from Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 102,000. Mr Rowland Gee, managing director, said it was still too early to predict recovery in menswear retailing. Turnover for the 109-store group fell to Pounds 51.8m (Pounds 54.8m). Cecil Gee, which mainly trades in London, was worst affected and saw a 10 per cent fall in sales. But London was now recovering more quickly than other regions, Mr Gee said. Suit Co, spread throughout the UK and therefore better insulated from recession in the south-east, lifted turnover slightly. Its estimated share of the UK suit market grew from 3.2 to 5.8 per cent. The hire division increased its market share from 25 per cent to 35 per cent with last year's purchase of Dormie from Sears Menswear for Pounds 775,000. Gross profits increased slightly to Pounds 24.6m (Pounds 24.5m) due to better buying and stock control, and despite last April's 2.5 per cent VAT rise. This cost the company about Pounds 500,000 because the increase was not fully passed on to customers. There was a Pounds 1.5m prior year tax credit from reduced provisions for capital gains tax on the 1988 sale of its Covent Garden shop. Earnings fell to 5.19p (9.43p) per share before the tax credit, but rose to 14.18p if it is included. The directors are recommending a maintained final dividend of 3.5p, to make an unchanged total of 5p. The shares gained 4p to 118p. COMMENT Moss Bros' evidently stronger second half augurs well for the coming year. But as Mr Gee points out, predicting the timing of recovery is tricky because of distorting features last year, such as the VAT rise and an earlier Easter. Even if confidence returns, consumers may prefer to buy new kitchens before new suits. Yet most of the rental reversions are out of the way, and the VAT losses will not have to be repeated. Forecast profits of Pounds 1.6m put the shares on a multiple of about 19, in line with their sector. Given the company's affinity for the steady rather than the spectacular, the rating looks about right.</p>

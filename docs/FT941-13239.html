			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Government Bonds: Weakness in Germany affects prices across Europe A sudden drop in German government bonds was yesterday attributed to factors ranging from worries about the lack of progress at the IG Metall pay talks, to a large sell order hitting a relatively thin market. Union negotiators have warned that German employers could face a fierce industrial dispute if they remain inflexible. The union has also threatened token strikes later this month. Earlier in the day, the market had found fleeting cheer in the release of favourable January inflation data from the state of Baden-Wurttemberg. The March bund future on Liffe rose as high as 100.21, but slumped to 99.79 in the late afternoon in good volume, down 0.34 point on the day. The weakness in Germany spread to other government bond markets in Europe. UK gilts fell by as much as  3/8 point at the long end in thin trading as the market awaited the Bank of England's Pounds 2.75bn auction of 15-year stock today. By contrast, gilts with shorter maturities found greater protection, losing only around  1/16 point. The March long gilt future on Liffe stood at 119 3/8 in late trading, down 13/32 on the day and off the day's high of 119 7/8 . Italian government bonds were hit by the fall in Germany and by news that the minimum accepted rate at the Bank of Italy's L7,000bn repurchase tender for government securities rose to 8.65 per cent from 8.60 per cent at the last operation on January 19. The unexpected rise in short-term rates led traders to speculate that the bank was seeking to build up the availability of funds in case of jitters in the financial markets in the run-up to the general election in March. The March future on Liffe went as high as 119.06, as traders sought to break the previous record high of 119.12, before dropping back to 118.59 in the late afternoon, a loss of 0.34 point on the day. Danish government bonds were boosted in the morning by news that the Danish finance ministry had reduced its estimate for Denmark's state budget deficit for 1993 and 1994 to around or just below DKr50bn. In its last economic forecast in December, the ministry had forecast budget shortfalls of DKr51.7bn and DKr54.4bn for 1993 and 1994 respectively. The 8 per cent state bond due 2003 stood a half-point higher at 113.95 by the early afternoon, but later fell back due to weakness in German government bonds. Spanish government bonds bucked the weaker trend in Europe and rallied in the wake of the Bank of Spain's unexpected cut in its money rate, to 8.75 per cent from 9 per cent. The market was also supported by the peseta's strengthening after the rate cut. The yield on 10-year government bonds fell to 7.74 per cent from 7.8 per cent. Japanese government bond futures fell more than a point in Tokyo on fears that the Japanese ministry of finance might increase the size of its monthly auction, which is due to be held today. The auctions usually raise Y1,000bn, but there was speculation that the ministry would increase the amount to Y1,200bn. The market was also undermined by the recovery in the stock market, which traders said prompted some investors to switch short-term funds from bonds into equities. The March future fell to 114.80 at the close in Tokyo, down 1.15 points from Monday's final level, and drifted to 114.58 in London trading. Prices on longer-dated US bonds were weaker yesterday, but the short end held steady as sufficient demand surfaced for the Treasury's auction of Dollars 17bn in new two-year notes. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  15/32 at 98 13/16 , with the yield rising to 6.334 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was unchanged at 100 5/16 , to yield 4.061 per cent. At the beginning of the session, uncertainty over the market's ability to absorb the fresh supply hit prices across the maturity range. However, the short end soon rebounded and finished the day with little change after the sale went smoothly. The bid-to-cover ratio - which measures bids tendered and accepted - was 2.85, indicating fairly strong demand. Most of the damage came at the long end. Misgivings about the pace of economic recovery were stirred by news of a surge in sales of existing single-family homes in December. A weaker-than-expected reading on consumer confidence by the Conference Board failed to improve sentiment. The market's next hurdle comes today, when the Treasury auctions Dollars 12bn in five-year notes. Many dealers were selling securities to lighten inventories ahead of the sale.</p>

			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Management: Resetting the clock - Asea Brown Boveri is transforming its factories by slashing lead times Asea Brown Boveri, the Swedish-Swiss engineering giant, is going through what it calls 'a new industrial revolution' in its plants around the world. Known as the T50 strategy in Sweden, where it is most advanced, it has a firm objective: to halve all lead times in the company's activities by the end of this year. This is being done by decentralising work responsibilities and widening individual worker skills within teams. 'We have made work cycle times the instrument for reform,' declares Bert-Olof Svanholm, ABB's Swedish president, the inspiration behind T50. 'Time at work is a concept everybody can understand.' The company can point to some early successes for the strategy. In its power systems production it has cut the time for making high-voltage direct current transmission equipment from three to two years. The time for supplying customers with standard switchgear has fallen from three to five weeks to three to five days from receipt of the order to delivery. Cycle times in ABB's components division have been reduced from 86 to 35 days. ABB started to introduce T50 into its Swedish plants in June 1990. In the company's words it is 'a programme with a beginning but no end'. An estimated half of the company's 32,000 Swedish workers are now involved actively in the strategy with most of the rest in the initial stages. So far the company claims that, on average, cycle times have been slashed by 21 per cent and more than 300 high-performance teams have been created. Until now, ABB argues, most companies have given the highest priority to reforming direct production methods. 'For too long the direct production area alone has been the autostrada of manufacturing and little attention was being given to what happened before and after it,' explains Svanholm. He draws inspiration for the strategy from the practice of lean management so widespread in Japan's auto industry. 'We are trying to blend Japanese methods with the Swedish work culture,' he explains. The drive behind T50 has come from the top of ABB under the direction of Percy Barnevik, the company's charismatic chief executive. He made his senior managers read and digest the influential management study from the Boston Consultancy group - Competing Against Time - when it was published three years ago. The company is perhaps better suited than most Swedish enterprises to introduce the time-based concept into its operations. 'We have become a very decentralised organisation over the past 10 years,' explains Svanholm. 'If we had tried this in the old days of stratified management hierarchies there would have been so much resistance and it would have been abandoned within a fortnight.' It was the structural change pushed through by Barnevik in Asea during the early 1980s that paved the way. The T50 concept was a logical evolution from the existing organisation, not a radical break with past practice. T50's most important result has been to place the much-hyped, but seldom-practised, principle of customer satisfaction at the centre of ABB's priorities. 'The customers are our focus. We must respond to their demands for the delivery of orders on time,' says Svanholm. It is the close alliance forged between the company and the trade unions that smoothed the way for T50. Indeed, says Svanholm, the trade unions at ABB are as enthusiastic as the company in transforming the work process. 'They were in on the strategy from the start,' he points out. According to Klaus Eklund, who headed a government-commissioned inquiry into Sweden's productivity problems, ABB has gone much further than other companies in creating 'a coalition between progressive management and blue-collar unions in boosting productivity'. The unions, moreover, have established their own committees to monitor T50 and make sure it works with the full involvement of their members. Without such co-operation it is hard to see how T50 could make any headway in ABB's Swedish plants, where the unions remain powerful. In part, the strategy has developed in response to the expressed views of the company's own employees. Three years ago ABB commissioned an independent opinion survey of the shopfloor mood. It found that while manual as well as white-collar workers were loyal and committed to the company they felt they did not enjoy enough influence over their own working conditions, their work was not being managed effectively enough and there was a lack of team spirit. Such findings strengthened Svandholm's conviction that the company needed to reappraise its attitude to its own employees. 'We want to create a new kind of independent-minded, all-round worker,' he explains. 'There is a lot of bullshit in management theory about treating people as a human resource. But too often that has meant very little in practice. We really do believe workers should become adaptable and independent and as a result gain more control over their own work.' For ABB T-50 means the prospect of bigger profits, better productivity and higher-quality products as well as lower absenteeism and labour turnover. For the employees it means a better working environment, greater job interest with constant skill upgrading, and eventually a better wage rate linked more closely to individual effort. The creation of what ABB calls Target Oriented High Performance work teams made up of 10 to 15 workers is crucial to the T50 strategy. 'The old system handed down orders from above through different, fragmented departments and it was very time-consuming,' explains Kenneth Synnersten, ABB's executive vice-president in charge of T50 in Sweden. 'Now we organise around the flow of production through the team approach.' The traditional system involved specialised demarcation of responsibilities for sales, inventories, production and distribution with an inevitably high level of bureaucratic managerial control and top-heavy administration. By the creation of smaller, flexible teams with wider responsibilities, the frontiers between administration and production have been abolished. The new strategy has also brought the collapse of the barriers separating white- from blue-collar workers. Now all ABB employees are called 'associates' and under new agreements will have the same pay rates, working hours, holidays and travel allowances, although this has brought some difficulty with some white-collar workers who fear a threat to their status. T50 has also introduced what Svanholm calls a 'flat organisation with fewer bosses and more workers taking on responsibilities'. As a result the functions of ABB's line managers have been transformed. 'They have many more demanding job tasks to do now,' says Svanholm. 'Before they were a combination of policeman and errand boy. Now they act as a support for workers.' The foremen and the production engineer are being turned into 'coaches' who move between the work teams to assist when needed. The company puts a strong emphasis on training and education. The need to upgrade worker skills lies at the heart of the T50 strategy. What ABB wants is to heighten the competence of each worker within the team. The strategy, however, is not trouble-free. It is being introduced at ABB in the middle of recession. 'So far this has not affected the programme,' insists Synnersten. But the strategy means a leaner workforce. Without any growth in production up to a quarter of ABB's jobs may disappear as a result. 'Yes, T50 will mean fewer jobs,' admits Anders Vallius from the Metalworkers union. 'But if we can increase sales in the longer term then employment opportunities will go up as well. We know ABB must stay ahead of its competitors.'</p>

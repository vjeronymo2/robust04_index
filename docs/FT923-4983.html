			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / International Company News: Air Canada in new plan for merger with PWA AIR CANADA has presented a new merger proposal to PWA, holding company of Canadian Airlines International, which aims to overcome objections to earlier plans for the creation of a single national airline. The proposal is the latest move in a battle for survival between the two Canadian carriers, both of which are suffering heavy losses. Air Canada is anxious to thwart moves by Calgary-based PWA to revive plans for an alliance with American Airlines. At the same time, the Montreal-based carrier is taking steps to forge its own international links. Last week, it announced an offer with a group of Texas investors to buy Continental Airlines of the US, which is operating under bankruptcy protection. Air Canada's latest proposal to PWA seeks to answer fears that a new monopoly carrier would be dominated by Air Canada and would result in massive job losses. Under the revised version, the two groups would set up a joint holding company but would continue to be managed separately by chief operating officers in Calgary and Montreal. Domestic and international routes would be rationalised to minimise competition. Shareholders in each airline would receive one share in the new holding company for each share presently held. Mr Hollis Harris, Air Canada chief executive, said the offer 'is viewed as a partnership to build a strong Canadian carrier for the future, and not as an Air Canada takeover'. PWA has made no secret of its distaste for any deal with Air Canada. Earlier this week, it asked a court to declare insolvent the computerised reservation system which it shares with Air Canada. The move is widely interpreted as an effort to link Canadian Airlines to the Sabre network owned by American Airlines.</p>

			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / International Company News: Hong Kong group buys Charles Jourdan - The changes taking place in the French footwear industry CHARLES Jourdan, one of the best known names among France's classic shoe makers, has fallen victim to the downturn in the luxury goods industry by being taken over by Dickson Concepts, a Hong Kong retailing group. The deal comes at a time of far-reaching changes for the French footwear companies which, in common with other areas of the global luxury goods market, are experiencing intense financial pressure. Earlier this year Stephane Kelian, one of Jourdan's chief competitors in France, was forced to seek a fresh injection of capital to restructure its finances. Dickson Concepts has agreed to acquire Jourdan for FFr158m (Dollars 28.21m) by buying an initial 20 per cent stake for FFr40m with an agreement to purchase the remaining shares between 1993 and 1994. The market for luxury shoes enjoyed rapid growth in the 1980s thanks to strong demand from Europe, North America and the new market of Japan. The French companies, based around the traditional shoe-making town of Romans in the Rhone valley, benefited from the buoyant climate. Even in the bullish era of the 1980s they came under fierce pressure from the Italian shoe industry. In the past year or so this pressure has intensified as tastes have swung back to classic styles, and old-established Italian companies, such as Gucci and Ferragamo, have staged a renaissance. These problems have been aggravated by the slowdown in the global luxury goods market reflecting the economic problems of the US and, more recently, of Japan. Charles Jourdan has attempted to cut costs by transferring production from the Rhone valley to lower-cost plants in Spain and by shedding staff. Its manufacturing workforce in France has fallen from 2,100 in 1986 to 650. But the group has been plagued by intermittent financial problems. It made a net loss of Dollars 4.6m in 1991, although this represented a reduction on its Dollars 9.5m loss from 1990. Earlier this year Jourdan was forced into short-time working, while management sought a longer-term solution to its financial difficulties. Meanwhile Stephane Kelian has found a French solution to its problems in the form of Andre, one of France's largest footwear groups, which has taken a stake in the company following a FFr46.6m recapitalisation package on the Lyon stock market.</p>

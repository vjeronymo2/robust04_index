			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / This Week: Music Two of the best female voices in rock bring out greatest hits collections this week. Tina Turner celebrates three decades of chart success with The Collected Recordings: Sixties to Nineties (EMI/Capitol), a three-CD set which includes rare recordings from every period of her career. Listening to the set from beginning-to-end reminds one of how superior her early material was to the blander songs written for her in the 1980s, when she enjoyed a remarkable renaissance. The less famous but arguably more influential Donna Summer also looks back nostalgically with Endless Summer - the Very Best of Donna Summer (Mercury), featuring highlights from her 20-year career, from the provocative Love to Love You Baby to the highly intelligent versions of On the Radio and State of Independence. Having been rather left out of the rush of cross-over artists releasing album after album of pleasant, tuneful melodies, Julie Andrews makes her own measured response with Broadway - the Music of Richard Rogers (Philips), which includes new versions of her most famous material: The Sound of Music, Edelweiss and My Funny Valentine. The voice seems in good nick, but it all sounds distinctly stocking-filler-for-granny to me. Many punters over the age of 11 will be pleased to see the return to fashion of the three-minute, melodic English pop song. The latest example of the genre is Dodgy's new album, Homegrown (A&amp;M), full of bright tunes and a light, feel-good touch which repays a listen. The choir of King's College, Cambridge, directed by Stephen Cleobury, tackles the work of three of the most religious composers of the 20th century on Ikos (EMI). The pieces, by Henryk Gorecki, Arvo Part and John Tavener, are proof that we do not need to go back to Gregorian chants to find spirituality in music. Two of the rarer operas in the repertoire, both with eastern European connections, get an airing this week. On the Marco Polo label, Antoni Wit conducts the Polish National Radio Symphony Orchestra for Karol Szymanowski's King Roger, while on Philips, Valery Gergiev and the Kirov Orchestra and Opera perform a live version of Rimsky-Korsakov's Sadko. Finally, the Christmas present from hell. I can only give it to you straight: James Last and Richard Clayderman perform a selection of popular tunes including Love is All Around, I Will Always Love You and (gulp) Streets of Philadelphia on In Harmony (Polydor).

The names of the companies were found in the petition and in data supplied by the Port Import Export Reporting Service (PIERS). We requested MOFTEC's assistance in forwarding the survey to all exporters and producers of furfuryl alcohol and in submitting complete responses on their behalf. On June 23, 1994, MOFTEC sent us a list of exporters of furfuryl alcohol. On July 1 and 8, 1994, we sent letters to the China Chamber of Commerce of Metals, Minerals &amp; Chemical Importers &amp; Exporters (CCCMMC) for assistance in identifying the producers and any other exporters of furfuryl alcohol. CCCMMC provided a list of producers on July 12, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On July 15, 1994, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) notified the Department of its preliminary determination that there is a reasonable indication that an industry in the United States is materially injured by reason of imports of furfuryl alcohol from the PRC that are alleged to be sold at less than fair value.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department forwarded to MOFTEC and those PRC producers and exporters identified in the course of this proceeding full questionnaires on August 5, 1994. Additionally, during the month of August 1994, the Department held a questionnaire presentation with company officials in China.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On September 2, 1994, responses to section A of our questionnaire were received from the following two exporters of furfuryl alcohol: Qingdao Chemicals &amp; Medicines Import &amp; Export Corporation (Qingdao I&amp;E) and Sinochem Shandong Import &amp; Export Group Corporation Ltd.

(Zhucheng), and Zibo Gaintact Chemical Co., Ltd. (Zibo).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On September 20, 1994, we received relevant responses to the remaining sections of our questionnaire from Qingdao I&amp;E, Sinochem Shandong I&amp;E, Linzi, Zhucheng, and Zibo.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Autonomy Is the Life and Soul of FTC"] </F>   [Text] While the Fair Trade Commission [FTC] is a bona fide  administrative agency, it differs from the other government  agencies in that it is a "quasi-legislative organ" with  additional authority similar to that of the public prosecutors  office.    The FTC is given authority to indict and criminally  prosecute  acts which violate the Antimonopoly Law. The chairman and four  commission members, like the public prosecutor's office and  judges, are guaranteed the authority to independently perform  their duties.    Former Construction Minister Kishiro Nakamura's request that  the FTC overlook indictment of the "dango" incident by the  Saitama Doyokai was tantamount to demanding a change by the  court prior to its decision. This is quite difficult to  comprehend.    In addition, it has been clarified that former Prime  Minister  Miyazawa relayed former LDP [Liberal Democratic Party] Vice  President Kanemaru's wish to "forego indictment" to former FTC  Umezawa. He cannot escape criticism for indiscretion.    The responsibility of politicians will eventually be  clarified. The problem is that politicians had the understanding  that "the policy of the FTC could be changed by applying  pressure."    The FTC's posture in seeking the understanding and  cooperation of politicians--particularly of the ruling parties'  Dietmen--on budget acquisition and reform of laws is, as in the  case of the other agencies, inevitable in some aspects. However,  if a relationship of indebtedness arises with an inclination to  comply with demands, it is simply out of the question.    The FTC should take this opportunity for a complete  reexamination of past antimonopoly administration. It is  necessary to check whether it has permitted political  intervention, or whether it has lacked the integrity to reject  pressures when there were doubtful moves. Unless it does so,  suspicion concerning the FTC's autonomy cannot be eradicated.    When former Chairman Umezawa dropped the idea of criminal  indictment, he stated that "it was totally based on a lack of  evidence" and denied any pressures from politicians. If it was  based on close consultation with the public prosecutors office,  we would like to believe at the present that it was a proper  judgment.    However, if the arrest of former Construction Minister  Nakamura was in fact based on suspicion, it would mean that he  had lied about the intervention by politicians. Umezawa himself  should clarify when and how the former construction minister  applied pressure and whether there were other approaches made.    It is well known that the FTC is a "legacy" left by the  postwar U.S. Occupation policy. Subsequently, emasculation of  the Antimonopoly Law has consistently been contrived.    However, a reinforcement of the FTC has been demanded  through  the Japan-U.S. talks. The government is faced with the need to  promote competitive measures based on the Antimonopoly Law in  order to set forth a posture of emphasis on the consumers. The  role of the FTC has grown unprecedentedly.    To meet the expectations of the people, the FTC must adopt a  consistent posture to avoid the impression that its application  of the Antimonopoly Law is arbitrary and discriminatory.    There is said to be a considerable variation in the  interpretation of the Antimonoply Law among experts. It is  therefore important to display clear-cut judgment. If its  application varies according to acts of violation, credibility  regarding antimonopoly administration will not only be shaken,  but also political intervention will be permitted to pass  through the cracks.    There is also a problem with the present FTC system. In  recent years, the chair has been occupied by former Treasury  Ministry officials. The remaining four commission seats have all  been occupied by former bureaucrats. Based on the nature of the  FTC's duty to promote fair business activity and free  competition, an array of personnel that speaks for the  government agencies is not desirable. Representatives of the  consumers and neutral persons such as scholars should be  appointed.    Political intervention can be rejected by enhancing  neutrality and by consistent and appropriate application of the  Antimonopoly Law.</p>

			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Renewed interest rate doubts depress shares - Market Report Weakness in government bond prices, reflecting underlying worries over interest rate prospects, wore down the UK equity market towards the close of yesterday's trading session. After moving erratically at first, the FT-SE 100-share Index closed 9.9 off at 3,150.5, only just above the low for the day. The fall would have been greater but for gains in several pharmaceutical stocks as European investors pondered the implications of the Dollars 8.5bn bid for American Cyanamid from American Home Products, which has put a new - and higher - price tag on drug company assets. The attention placed on the blue chip pharmaceuticals kept market turnover at a satisfactory level, from the point of view of the market participants. But the general tone of the market was uninspiring, with August holiday factors taking effect among fund managers already evidently unwilling to chase stocks ahead. At the day's low of 3,150.1, the Footsie was beginning to approach support levels, so traders were not unhappy to see the index steady in the final minutes. Profit-takers appeared to be less active across the broader range of second line stocks, where the FT-SE Mid 250 Index gained 10.6 at 3,700.2. Wall Street was 9 Dow points off at the London close, and the unexpected dip in US jobless claims set the scene for data due today on US unemployment and payrolls. Any sign that economic recovery is stronger than expected would bring back fears that the Federal Reserve may tighten credit policy. On the other side of the interest rate balance, yesterday's disclosure that German industrial orders were strong in June suggested less pressure on the Bundesbank to trim its rates any further. In early trading, the Footsie added nearly 6 points, largely under the influence of the stock index futures sector. Shares in Zeneca, last year's biochemicals spin-off from ICI, rose sharply after disclosure of a gain in underlying profits for the first half; but part of the share gain related to the general speculation among drug stocks. A more direct focus for speculation came in the advance in Wellcome, which had been previously identified as a possible target by a US securities house. Uncertainty in the US dollar restrained other blue chip share sectors, the oil issues slipping back in modest turnover. The banking stocks, still responding to trading statements from the leading names, were mostly firmer. Elsewhere, the modest improvements in the early part of the session served to bring out the profit-takers later. Investors now take the view that, while UK interest rates are unlikely to rise for at least a month, the prospect of higher base rates may counterbalance the benefits of the flow of higher earnings and dividend announcements from British companies. Interest rate-related issues closed with mixed changes, the dull spots being those building and construction stocks with a German focus. The excitement on the food retailing side died down, and shares in William Low traded at an acceptable discount to the 360p a share cash bid with which Tesco scooped the victory from J. Sainsbury, the rival bidder which drew the line firmly at 305p. Stock Exchange statistics for Wednesday's session showed that retail, or customer, business in equities remained high, returning an overall worth of Pounds 1.61bn. Trading volume, as measured by the Seaq electronic network, was again buoyant yesterday, with 670.6m shares traded compared with 711m on the previous day. But non-Footsie stocks made up around 62 per cent of yesterday's total, an increase on recent sessions and an indication of increased activity among the capital goods stocks represented in the FT-SE Mid 250 Index.</p>

			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HILL GIVES BACKING TO HORCHER  </P> <P> State Sen. Frank Hill (R-Whittier), who said last week that he would not  endorse anyone as his successor in the 52nd Assembly District, changed his mind  this week and endorsed Diamond Bar Councilman Paul Horcher.  </P> <P> Hill said he endorsed Horcher because of Horcher's support during his campaign  for the state Senate earlier this year.  </P> <P> Horcher was so critical of former Diamond Bar Councilman Gary Miller, who was  running against Hill, that Horcher was removed by his council colleagues as  mayor pro tem, next in line to become mayor. "I had a tough time saying no to  Paul," Hill said. "He stuck his neck out for me.  </P> <P> Horcher's opponents quickly downplayed the endorsement's significance.  </P> <P> "I don't think it's going to be a big deal in this campaign," said Kenneth  Manning, a Hacienda La Puente school board member who is one of eight  Republicans in the primary. Wil Baca, a Hacienda Heights businessman and  engineer, noted that Hill only last week had said he would not make an  endorsement because there was no front-runner. Nothing has happened in the  campaign to change that, Baca said, adding that the race is wide open.  </P> <P> Other Republicans in the race are Hacienda Heights Improvement Assn. board  member Jim Baker, West Covina construction foreman Jack Dortignac, former Rep.  Wayne Grisham of La Mirada, La Habra Heights attorney Paul Mautino and Hacienda  Heights political aide Tony Russo.  </P> <P> Gary Neely, a Diamond Bar marketing consultant, is the only Democrat in the  race.  </P></p>

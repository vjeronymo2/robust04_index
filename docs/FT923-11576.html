			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Strikes put strain on Polish austerity POLAND'S tight monetary policies are coming under threat from the country's most serious waves of industrial unrest since economic changes began three years ago. As strikes by coal and copper ore miners continue, an important western investor, Fiat, is also faced with a stoppage for the first time. Workers at the FSM plant in Tychy, which is being sold to the Italian motor group, went on strike on Wednesday to demand that their wages should correspond to those paid by Fiat in its plants elsewhere. Fiat produces its Cinquecento car at FSM and the autumn should see the completion of an agreement under which it has agreed to commit nearly Dollars 2bn to the plant in exchange for a 90 per cent share of the equity. The strike followed a stoppage which started on Monday by some 40,000 workers at the copper-producing combine at Lubin in western Poland. The miners are demanding a 30 per cent wage rise, which can only be paid if the government eases tough wage controls. Ms Hanna Suchocka, the new prime minister, told the senate, parliament's second chamber, yesterday that the government would not permit settlements which 'would favour one group of workers at the cost of other groups'. A strike also began at the Zofiowka coal mine, one of the largest pits in the Rybnik mining region in southern Poland which had remained unaffected by last week's stoppages in about 15 pits elsewhere. The coal industry is already reporting financial losses, and pay concessions would imply a return to government subsidies. These would place an additional burden on the budget where the present ceiling for the deficit of 5 per cent of gross domestic product is seen by the International Monetary Fund as a key element of a forthcoming agreement on renewed Polish access to credits worth Dollars 1.6bn. Real wages in Poland in the first five months of the year fell by 5 per cent compared with the same period last year, while money supply has contracted by 1 per cent since the beginning of the year.</p>

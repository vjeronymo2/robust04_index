Speaking at an official lunch in the  Kremlin in honor of the British premier on Tuesday [15  February], the Russian president stressed John Major's sincere  attention to what happens in Russia, his real and concrete  support of democratic reforms in the country.    Yeltsin indicated that Russia moves along this path not  easily, like all countries which have already passed it. "But  the most important thing is that a reliable foundation, the  Constitution, has been laid beneath the reform building,"  Yeltsin said.    President Yeltsin expressed satisfaction with the talks in  Moscow and the signed documents, noting that every meeting with  John Major brings "something new and significant in relations  between the two countries, brings them closer to each other and  enriches their cooperation."    Boris Yeltsin pointed out that Russia and Great Britain  share  common goals and values -- to do everything possible so that  people live in a safer and more prosperous world, be free and  not worried about the fate of their children and grandchildren.    "Our approaches are not completely the same," the president  said. "And naturally it is in common interests to find a correct  and painless way toward reaching this great and noble goal." He  said this is one of the most important guidelines of the  Russian-British cooperation.</p>

			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong and New Zealand extend gains THE CLOSURE of Tokyo yesterday for the second of its Golden Week holidays did not restrain other Pacific Rim markets, which were more concerned with domestic matters. HONG KONG extended its gains in active trading following the previous day's 2.6 per cent surge, but it came off slightly in the final minutes of trading. The Hang Seng index climbed 11.74 to 3,737.88, up 3.1 per cent on the week. Turnover improved to HKDollars 1.82bn from HKDollars 1.72bn. The index came off the day's high of 3,769 on rumours that Li Ka-Shing, the Hong Kong investor, would issue a second batch of covered warrants on his companies, Cheung Kong (Holdings) and Hutchison Whampoa. NEW ZEALAND made its biggest gain in three months, which took the market to its best level since October 2. The Barclays index closed 36.28 or 2.4 per cent higher at 1,527.83, a rise of 3 per cent on the week. Turnover was active at NZDollars 33m, up from NZDollars 19.6m. The continuing rally in the bond market fuelled the gains, after news that the current account deficit would be revised sharply downwards. Fletcher Challenge rose 7 cents to NZDollars 4.10 on volume of 2.7m shares and Brierley Investments gained 5 cents to NZDollars 1.10 on 4m shares. AUSTRALIA slipped in quiet trading. The All Ordinaries index eased 2.1 to 1,517.8 - a fall on the week of 1.3 per cent - in turnover of ADollars 159m, down from ADollars 197m. Investors took profits in morning trading, while the firmer Australian dollar depressed mining stocks. Foreigners stayed away after Thursday's suspension of Adelaide Steamship and its associates, Tooth and Co and David Jones, after they shelved their restructuring plans. Pioneer International fell 6 cents to ADollars 2.50. On Wednesday, it announced a placement of 70m new shares at ADollars 2.55 each to raise ADollars 178.5m. TAIWAN moved higher in thin trade, with the weighted index up 75.88 or 1.3 per cent at 5,852.95, but down 1.5 per cent on the week. Turnover fell to TDollars 49.6bn from TDollars 59.1bn. SEOUL fell slightly in spite of further moves by the government to prop up the stock market. The composite index lost 3.17 to 649.10, up 2.3 per cent on the week, in turnover of Won141.4bn, down from Won341.2bn. The government announced an emergency measure yesterday, making about Dollars 3bn worth of low interest loans to three local investment trust firms that have suffered serious financial difficulties. The loans would come from the government's surplus funds deposited at the Bank of Korea. The three investment trust firms would be allowed to resume stock purchases after clearing their debts with the new loans. SINGAPORE fell in light trading. The Straits Times Industrial index lost 11.28 to 1,545.95, down 0.8 per cent on the week. Volume fell to 51m shares from 67.5m. KUALA LUMPUR was also weak, although rises in index stocks helped the composite index rise 0.89 to 588.09. BANGKOK suffered a correction after its recent strength. The SET index fell 10.93 to 868.00, a decline of 0.5 per cent during the week. Turnover was about 3.9bn baht. JAKARTA remained under selling pressure, which brought the index down 4.74 to 407.48. Volume fell to 2.64m shares from 3.77m. MANILA drifted lower in dull trading. The composite index shed 3.15 to 1,058.68, but rose 1 per cent on the week. The turnover shrank to 98m pesos from 112m pesos. BOMBAY recovered on prospects of a right-wing win in elections this month. The BSE index rose 36.98 to 1,272.09.</p>

			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Ferruzzi The news from Ferruzzi goes from bad to worse - as yesterday's collapse in the share price after a two-day suspension demonstrates. The position was desperate even before the additional losses in commodity futures trading were disclosed on Tuesday. Since international auditors have now been through the books, that could be the last of the nasty surprises. With an investigation into alleged political bribes still in progress, though, the stock market can hardly be blamed for assuming the worst. Reasons for optimism are few and far between. The appointment of foreign banks to the creditors steering committee offers some encouragement that restructuring proposals will meet the expectations of overseas investors. By forcing Ferruzzi to amend the terms of the proposed rights issue for La Fondiaria, its insurance subsidiary, the Italian investment authorities have also shown some teeth. If Tuesday's figures are correct, group companies are generating decent operating profits despite the pain of the parent. While such profits are still dwarfed by interest payments, that is reason to hope asset sales might be achieved even in the current depressed economic climate. On a sympathetic interpretation, the two-week delay in presenting restructuring proposals might allow for the completion of the proposed sale of Himont, the chemicals subsidiary, to Shell. It will, however, take more than one disposal to restore financial balance.</p>

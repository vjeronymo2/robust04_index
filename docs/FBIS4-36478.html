			<p>BFN     [Text] Philippine Foreign Minister Roberto Romulo says he  will positively recommend to his president Israel Aircraft  Industries products, particularly Kfir planes. At the end of  his visit he called on Israeli high-tech firms to establish  production and marketing systems in the Philippines that could  serve as a basis for all Southeast Asia. Romulo also said his  country would be glad to help Israel in promoting relations with  Muslim states in the area, whom he believed would establish full  ties with Israel as the peace process advanced.</p>

			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Call to overhaul medicine charges A restructuring of the way National Health Service patients pay for medicines is expected to be recommended tomorrow by the Commons health committee, Paul Abrahams and David Owen write. It will publish a report proposing that exemptions for prescription charges should be based on the ability to pay rather than arbitrary categories. At present broad categories - such as women over 60, men over 65, nursing mothers, and some people with long-term illnesses - are exempt from the charge. The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry says this means that as many as 85 per cent of prescriptions are free. The MPs will call for a significant reduction in the Pounds 4.75 prescription charge. Their report is not expected to propose a figure to which the charge should be reduced. It is understood that the report was not unanimously agreed, with some Labour MPs on the committee voting against some of the more radical proposals. The committee is expected to call for a thorough overhaul of the pharmaceutical price-regulation scheme, by which the government controls drugs company profits. Some MPs are understood to want its abolition. The report will urge the Department of Health to establish a national formulary - a list of drugs paid for by the NHS and prescribed by hospitals and general practitioners. Patients prescribed drugs not on the list would have to pay for their medicines privately. The committee wants pharmacies to be able to dispense cheaper generic medicines if doctors prescribe a branded alternative. The report will add pressure on the government to continue its efforts to limit the growth of the NHS drugs bill, although the committee has no power to force the government to implement its recommendations. The conclusions are likely to draw significant criticisms from the pharmaceuticals industry, which has warned that efforts to reduce the growth of the NHS drugs bill could undermine the UK's position as one of the world's leading centres for medicines research.</p>

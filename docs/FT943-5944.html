			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Japan Tobacco at Pounds 9,410 a share leaves 'em gasping: Monopoly's privatisation price seems steep as core growth is being extinguished The Japanese finance ministry yesterday put a market value of Y2,876bn (Pounds 18.6bn) on the country's monopoly cigarette manufacturer, setting the privatisation price for Japan Tobacco at what many found a gasp-inducing Y1.438m (Pounds 9,410) per share. While maximising revenues for the government at a time when its tax receipts are down, the pricing drew concerns from analysts that the Tokyo Stock Exchange might be in for another bumpy autumn journey. Initial trading last October in JR East, the previous big state sell-off, all but derailed the exchange's systems as the price ran up furiously. But liquidity was drained from the rest of the market, and stock in the regional train operator eventually fell back to join other issues in a hibernation which they have yet to shake off. Japan Tobacco shares, which go on sale from tomorrow, start trading on October 27. Like JR East, the company has strong cash flow and a healthy land portfolio. It is also virtually debt-free. But like tobacco groups elsewhere, it has no prospect of growth in its main business. Its diversification attempts are not expected to contribute significantly to earnings for as much as a decade. JT's asset base helped prompt bids of up to Y2.11m a share in a pre-offer auction among institutions. Although the lowest accepted bid in the auction of 230,000 shares, or 11.5 per cent of equity, was more than Y1.36m, some securities houses said the shares were worth only Y500,000 if measured against western industry leaders such as Philip Morris of the US, maker of Marlboro. After the public tranche, the government will retain two-thirds control of JT, and has left intact its status as the only licensed producer of cigarettes in Japan. The market has, however, been open to imports since 1987, and these have grown steadily to account for 17.9 per cent of all cigarettes sold in Japan last year. JT acknowledges that the rise in foreign penetration will continue. The company's main advantage is its distribution system, which extends to pavement vending machines which fall under its control. The main foreign brand there is Marlboro, which JT makes under licence. The group has struck a similar deal with France's Seita state monopoly to produce Gitanes Blondes, and international links are seen as a way forward. JT licenses its own best-selling Mild Seven brand to be manufactured in Malaysia, and in 1992 bought Manchester Tobacco in the UK to supply Europe and parts of Asia. In May JT said it was quintupling capacity in Manchester to 10bn cigarettes a year, a figure that pales compared with the 272.9bn JT products which Japanese lit up last year. Japan is among the few developed countries where most men still smoke - 59.8 per cent - but the proportion is slowly falling, while the 13.8 per cent of women who are smokers has barely changed in a decade. JT admits: 'We will see a decline in the number of young people who are the primary consumers, so the tobacco industry will be faced with difficulties.' Japan, where foreign consumer products have usually sold on a premium image, has not yet encountered the wave of supermarket brands which have brought price competition to some western cigarette markets. In the current climate of austerity JT recognises this as a threat and at least one US maker has begun selling a discounted line in Japan. To shape up for the private sector, JT's workforce has been cut by nearly a quarter to 23,700 and the number of domestic plants reduced by a similar margin to 26. It has sought other businesses, most notably pharmaceuticals where it now produces 40 over-the-counter drugs and an agent used in chemotherapy, its first prescription treatment developed in-house. But it is likely to be 10 years before the sector generates an income stream, and outlays are still high. The company spent Y40bn on a research centre for the division and says that such spending, along with increased promotional for its tobacco business, account for a steady increase in marketing and administrative expenses - these outlays rose 44 per cent over the past five years while pre-tax profits were up a little more than a third. JT is forecasting a 4.5 per cent dip in profits before tax to Y109bn in its current year to March, on a 2.6 per cent decline in sales to Y2,711bn. Net earnings are, however, projected to emerge higher at Y36,000 a share against Y33,246, from which a dividend of at least Y5,000 will be paid. Net assets per share in March were put at Y564,947. Most foreign funds which track Japanese stock market indices will shell out for some Mild Seven. But Mr Keith Donaldson, investment strategist at Salomon Bros in Tokyo, says: 'I don't think I'd recommend it at this price.' Individual Japanese investors may decide differently. But in a country where decisions are commonly made in smoke-filled rooms, there was one possible portent yesterday. As Mr Masayoshi Takemura, finance minister, chaired the meeting of dozens of officials and advisers which set the JT price, the air was curiously clear.</p>

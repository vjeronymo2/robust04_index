			<p><P> August 1, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> The Wrath of Bardot: Former film goddess turned animal rights champion Brigitte  Bardot has assailed the Islamic world's ritual slaughter of animals as  revolting and cruel. "It is revolting . . . and unacceptable that in the name  of religion, man should submit animals to such cruel and barbarous sufferings,"  she said in an interview published Tuesday in France's weekly magazine Present.  Bardot, 55, made her statement after seeing a film of the mass slaughter last  month of 3,000 sheep by North African immigrants in the Mediterranean port of  Marseille. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

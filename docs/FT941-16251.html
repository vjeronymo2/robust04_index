			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Thomas French pushes ahead to over Pounds 1m The integration of British Tapes together with the disposal of lossmaker Kaz Krafts enabled Thomas French &amp; Sons to record a rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 110,000 to Pounds 1.05m for the year to October 2. The figure took account of abortive acquisition costs of Pounds 257,000. Turnover of continuing businesses rose from Pounds 12.84m to Pounds 14.61m - the Manchester-based group makes curtain tapes and window accessories. Earnings worked through at 4.67p (0.19p). A proposed final dividend of 2.175p makes a maintained 3.625p total. Year-end gearing was reduced from 40 per cent to 22 per cent. Mr Michael Snapes, formerly managing director of Coral Holdings, has been appointed chief executive. The move splits the role of Mr Jeremy French, who continues as executive chairman. Mr French said the sale by Marling Industries in November of a 22.8 per cent stake to institutions should help share liquidity.</p>

			<p><P> October 3, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RALLY LAUNCHES AIDS AWARENESS MONTH  </P> <P> Los Angeles political leaders and activists kicked off AIDS Awareness Month  Monday by calling on area residents to become better educated about the deadly  disease and more supportive of those affected by it.  </P> <P> "We must realize our best defense is education," Mayor Tom Bradley told about  200 people at a rally at the Civic Center Mall. "We must call on the entire  community to help us generate enthusiasm in fighting the lack of information,  in fighting the tragedy of this disease."  </P> <P> Stephen Bennet, executive director of AIDS Project Los Angeles, said he felt  that he was "preaching to the saved here."  </P> <P> "If we were educating, I feel the mall should be filled with 10,000 people and  we should be storming buildings," he said. "I feel very frustrated. . . . I  feel the people who need to be educated are not just in the high-risk  population, but are elected officials."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ushuaia (DYN-NA) -- At least nine people were  seriously injured yesterday and scores arrested after police  clashed violently with groups of workers at the local Crown  Mustang electronics factory, where workers have been on strike  for 12 days in protest against a series of labour disputes.    The trouble was sparked off in the early hours of yesterday  morning when police moved in to the electronics factory and  tried to evict them and a number of reporters by force.    Among those seriously injured were at least five workers  from  the firm and four reporters. As many as 20 other workers were  said to have received minor injuries.    Although police denied there had been any arrests, reporters  said there had been several and that other people had been  forced to hand over identity documents.    Witnesses told reporters that police had been firing guns  amid the rioting and hitting workers with truncheons as the  trouble flared.    Workers had occupied the offices of the Crown Mustang  building for nearly two weeks in protest against low salaries  and redundancies. Fifteen workers at the firm and a further 120  at Continental Fueguina were laid off last week.    UOM metal workers union representative Oscar Martinez said  the repression had been "absolutely terrible" and that police  had "chased workers along the streets for at least ten blocks.    "One man had his head split open by a stick smashed over his  head by police," Martinez said. "Another was shot in the arm  while another was kicked while on the ground."    A statement, issued by Tierra del Fuego Government Minister  Fulvio Baseda, said that the violent eviction order had been  ordered by Judge Fernando Machado after workers had refused to  stop their strike late Friday evening.    Moments later in direct contradiction to the statement,  Tierra del Fuego Governor Jose Strabillo, who had said Friday  that the strikes would not lead to violence, said that the  police action had been wholly justified: "They (the police) were  merely carrying out their legal orders."    "On arrival (at the factory) they were hit by stones and  home-made bombs that were being thrown out of the windows of the  factory by the workers," the governor said.    Yet Strabillo's deputy, Miguel Angel Castro, told reporters  later in the evening that there would be an immediate  independent investigation in order to determine whether the  police had in any way abused their authority.    He also said police had been ordered to move in given that  the workers had "illegally invaded what constitutes private  property."    As a result of the clashes, which workers said had been on  the cards ever since the government ordered a detachment of  Border Guards to the province last week supposedly to curb any  hints of violence, there will be a general strike tomorrow as a  further mark of protest.    Union leaders also refused to rule out further collective  action in the latter parts of next week.    Local reporters said the police had also cordoned off the  local FM Fuego radio station and fired rifle shots at its  offices, forcing the station to close down for some three hours.    Hours after the turmoil, witnesses said there was still  tension between the public and police as a series of marches  were being held through the streets with approximately 800  people participating.    The decision to strike was voted for unanimously by members  of the local branches of the UOM metal workers union, the ATSA  health workers union as well as members of the restaurant and  oil workers union.    Employees at local-based companies have been demanding wage  hikes for two years in order to compensate for living in one of  the most expensive provinces in the country.    Labour Minister Armando Caro Figueroa and Interior Minister  Carlos Ruckauf were originally due to visit the province  tomorrow in an attempt to pacify workers and bring the situation  back to normal. There was no immediate statement as to whether  the plans would still be enforced.    Meanwhile Ruckauf said last night that the government was  not  planning to revert to intervention in an attempt to bring order  to the troubled zone.    "It's not even a remote possibility," the minister said. "It  would only be considered if the local government pleaded for  such a step or if the police forces were out of their depth."    He added that although the government and security services  would continue to monitor the developments in the province  closely, they would respect the workers' right to strike.    Ruckauf emphasized that the Border Guards stationed nearby  were on alert and that the government would not hesitate to  dispatch them to the scene of the disturbances if the situation  gets out of hand over the next few days.</p>

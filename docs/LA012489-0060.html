			<p><P> January 24, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO EARNINGS  </P> <P>  Mycogen, a San Diego manufacturer of biopesticides, reported a first-quarter  net loss of $736,000 on revenue of $1.4 million, against a loss of $719,000 on  revenue of $1.3 million over the corresponding three months ended Dec. 31 the  previous year.  </P> <P> Reflecting the seasonality of Mycogen's product sales, its first-quarter  revenues were all derived from contract research and interest income. Mycogen's  only product, its M-One biopesticide for the Colorado potato beetle, is sold  only in the spring and summer, Vice President Andrew Barnes said Monday.  </P></p>

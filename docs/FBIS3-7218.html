			<p>Language: <F P=105> Vietnamese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nguyen Van Rop, Tay Ninh Province CPV secretary] </F>   [Text] Tay Ninh Province has a very important position in  the southwestern part of the fatherland and in eastern Nam Bo.  It served as a revolutionary base during the periods of  resistance. Thus, during the war, Tay Ninh was an area where the  enemy frequently launched attacks and sweeps. The material base  and infrastructure, which were weak to begin with, suffered  great damage. After the south was completely liberated, Tay Ninh  had to cope with the border war started by the Khmer Rouge. Tay  Ninh really started rebuilding only at the beginning of the  1980s.    Tay Ninh's border with Cambodia runs for 240 km. Recently  along the border, there have frequently been cases of smuggling,  encroachments on the land, armed robberies, and disturbances.  Many overseas Vietnamese living in Cambodia have been terrorized  by the Khmer Rouge and have had to take refuge here, which has  made the situation even more tense and complex.    There are many religious groups in Tay Ninh Province, and  this is where the Vatican, or "capital" of the Cao Dai religion  is located. The followers of the Cao Dai religion make up more  than 30 percent of the province's population. The  counterrevolutionaries and bad elements frequently make use of  the Cao Dai religion, disguise themselves as religious  followers, and plot to destroy the revolutionary regime.    This situation and these special characteristics mean that  we  must regularly solidify and build the party and revolutionary  forces, maintain political security, order, and social safety,  and stabilize and develop the economy and society. After the  seventh party congress and the fifth congress of the provincial  party organization, Tay Ninh made many positive changes, but  there are still a number of shortcomings and weaknesses. The  most striking thing is that some cadres and party members are  wavering with respect to their ideological position, their  confidence and combat will power has declined, their quality has  declined, their way of life has become degenerate, they have  become remote from the masses, and they violate party discipline  and the laws of the state. From 1989 to November 1992, a total  of 1,304 party members committed disciplinary violations. Among  these were committee chairmen and vice chairmen and sector heads  in the province, members of district Communist Party of Vietnam  standing committees, and members of party committees directly  subordinate to the province.    Although the apparatus has been solidified somewhat, it is  still not strong enough, particularly at the base, village, and  subward echelons and in the economic units. The staff committees  of the party committee echelons are generally weak. The district  echelon is both weak and unstable. As of September 1992, 11.59  percent of the party bases in the province were weak. In the  border villages, 15.78 percent of the party bases were weak, and  10.4 percent of the hamlets did not have any party members on  the spot. Only 7.3 percent of the party members came from  religious families.    Cadres are not selected, trained, assigned, or used  rationally. A number of sectors lack key cadres and cadres with  technical capabilities. As of September 1992, 18.99 percent of  the key cadres at the primary, district, and city levels had  only a level-I cultural standard; 86 percent of the cadres who  lead and manage sectors in the province, districts, and cities  had not attended advanced schools or college. For many reasons,  many cadres at the primary level lack enthusiasm and are not at  ease in their work.    Because of the lack of work regulations or because people do  not follow the regulations, in many places the relationship  between the party committee echelons and the people's councils  and between the party committees and the authorities and mass  organizations are "skewed" and they "overlap each other." At the  same time, a number of spheres lack party leadership.    After the resolution of the Third Plenum of the CPV Central  Committee was issued, we made an effort to continue renovating  and reorganizing the party and overcome the shortcoming and  weaknesses. We organized things to implement the resolution of  the third plenum and viewed this as an important step in  establishing order in order to implement the party's  resolutions. After accepting the resolution at the central  echelon, the standing committee of the provincial CPV committee  organized things to study and thoroughly understand the  resolution and immediately formulated an action program. After  that, we organized meetings for the key cadres from the  provincial to the primary echelons to help them thoroughly  understand the resolution of the central echelon and the action  program of the province. Based on that, the district, city, and  primary-level party committees formulated their own action  programs.    The striking points in understanding the resolutions and  formulating action programs this time are: Implementing the  party resolutions has been tied to carrying out the political  tasks and solving the pressing economic and social problems of  the localities. We view economic development as the central  task. Party construction is a key task, and security and  national defense work is an important and regular task. The  decisive element is organization-cadre work.    The party committee echelons are giving much attention to  formulating action programs. The provincial guidance committee  has directly contributed ideas to the action programs of the  districts, and party committees directly subordinate to the  province and bases have been chosen to serve as test points. In  providing guidance, the standing committee of the provincial  party committee has given much attention to ensuring that cadres  outside the party and the masses thoroughly understand the  resolution. As of March 1993, the resolution had been  disseminated to 135,268 people (approximately 16 percent of the  population).    In order to provide close and timely guidance, the  provincial  CPV committee has established a committee to guide disseminating  the resolutions. This committee consists of a number of members  of the standing committee of the provincial CPV committee, and  it is chaired by the deputy secretary of the standing committee.  We have also established work teams consisting of talented  cadres from the party committees in order to directly help,  guide, and monitor the target districts and bases. In the  districts and cities, the party committees directly subordinate  to the province are carrying on similar activities. As for  military party committees, we have not established guidance  committees. Instead, the standing committee of the provincial  military party committee is providing direct guidance. Besides  this, the provincial CPV committee and the party committee  echelons directly subordinate to the province have assigned  party committee members at each echelon the task of monitoring  and guiding a particular base. Today, at 127 of the 425 party  bases, provincial or district party committee members are  monitoring and guiding the implementation of the resolution of  the Third Plenum of the CPV Central Committee.    As for selecting guidance points, the province has selected  one border district (Ben Cau District), one inner district (Hao  Thanh District, where 98 percent of the people are followers of  the Cao Dai faith), one border village, one inner village, a  party chapter of the provincial people's organ of control, a  party chapter of the Sugar Cane Corporation, and a party  organization in the Tax Department. The party organizations  directly subordinate to the province have also selected 31 bases  to serve as test points.    After carrying out the resolution of the Third Plenum of the  CPV Central Committee for more than a year, although there are  still many limitations, we have achieved a number of results:    The majority of party members, cadres outside the party, and  masses see the urgent requirements and have grasped the basic  contents of renovating and reorganizing the party. Most party  members and people agree with the decrees of the central echelon  and regard renovating and reorganizing the party as a  particularly important and urgent task that is decisive for  building and defending the country and that is decisive with  respect to the fate of the party. With this understanding, the  party members and masses have actively participated in the work  of the party. The sense of responsibility of most party members  has been elevated, and their party concepts have been improved.  This is a major and fundamental achievement that has long-term  significance. Without this great response and participation, the  party committee echelons would not be able to achieve good  results in building the party.    Because of having integrated plans and good organization,  many places have solved various problems and made new changes.  The party committee echelons have grasped the real state of  affairs of the cadres and party members and the strengths and  weaknesses of each party base. Thus, when engaging in  self-criticism and criticism in accord with Directive 14-CT/TW  of the Secretariat of the CPV Central Committee, they have dealt  promptly with a number of party committee echelon members and  party members who had long been committing violations. They have  assigned tasks to party members who had not assigned tasks  previously. There is a closeness between retired party members  and party members now holding positions, and they are  coordinating things, which is helping to strengthen the party  bases. The changes in understanding have led to changes in  action. Many people have confidence in the party and want to  join. During the first six months of 1992, the province  recruited 191 party members, and during the first six months of  1993 it recruited 234 party members. A number of "white hamlets"  have been eliminated, and primary-level administration and  primary-level organizations have been solidified somewhat.    The party bases have begun to be solidified and reorganized  (29 bases have been disbanded, and 22 new bases have been  established). All of the bases have action programs. These  action programs have been thoroughly reviewed by higher  echelons, and the masses have contributed ideas to them. Because  of this, they are both practical and suitable, and this has  improved the quality of the activities of the party bases. More  than 93 percent of the various-echelon party committees have  completed making reviews and begun making good changes on many  fronts. Almost all of the party committees directly subordinate  to the province have expanded on the decisions of the Politburo  and Secretariat of the CPV Central Committee and the guidelines  of the Organization Department of the provincial CPV committee  on the functions, tasks, and work regulations of the various  types of party bases and on the requirements and contents in  examining strong party bases.    The party committee echelons have given special attention to  transforming cadre work, from renovating viewpoints on  evaluating and training cadres to renovating the procedures and  policies on compensating cadres. Based on examining and  evaluating the cadres, the party committee echelons have  formulated plans to train nearby cadres. The standing committee  of the provincial CPV committee has guided those in charge of  the blocks, committees, sectors, districts, cities, and party  committees directly subordinate to the province in grasping the  real situation and evaluating the key cadres who hold position,  cadres in line, and cadres with aspirations in order to examine  the entire system and formulate plans to fundamentally rearrange  and reorganize things.    Never before has Tay Ninh Province had such theoretical,  political, and technical training campaigns. Besides sending  cadres to train at schools and to attend classes at the central  echelon and at the zone, the province is also opening advanced  on-the-job theoretical and political classes. The provincial  party school has opened seven middle-level theoretical and  political classes in the province and in the districts. Among  these is one for scientific and technical cadres who are not  party members. Besides this, many cadres have been sent to  attend regular and on-the-job technical and professional classes  at colleges and on-the-job training centers.    Although the budget is still limited, the province has  decided to temporarily provide allowances to primary-level  cadres based on a fixed number. Specifically, the maximum number  for each village and subward is 33, including: party block, 4;  organizations, 10 (youth union: 2; Veterans Association: 1; Red  Cross: 1); people's council, 1; people's committee, 3; and  technical sectors, 15. Each hamlet has also been allotted two  for the party chapter secretary and the head of the hamlet  management board. The allowance system is being carried out in a  unified manner: The village and subward secretaries and chairmen  receive an allowance equal to the salary of the deputy bureau  chief at the district level. Those of the party chapter  secretaries and heads of the hamlet management boards are equal  to the salary of village sector heads. In addition to the  general stipulations, the border villages and key villages have  been given a number of additional allowances. Although they do  not match the labor of the primary-level cadres, these initial  allowances have increased the enthusiasm of these people, given  them peace of mind, and involved them deeply in the movements.    Because of the results achieved in party renovation and  reorganization, Tay Ninh has had positive economic and social  changes. As compared with previous years, since 1992, on many  fronts Tay Ninh has made clear progress, and the rate of  economic growth has been good. As compared with 1991, the 1992  gross social product increased 8.7 percent, the national income  increased 10 percent, and the value of agricultural yields  increased 10.5 percent. Paddy yields reached 295,000 tons, the  highest ever, averaging 309 kg of paddy per person per year.  During the first 6 months of 1993, agricultural production  increased in terms of both area and yields. As compared with the  same time last year, the crop growing area has increased 4  percent. In this, the rice area has increased 7 percent, the  manioc area has increased 11 percent, and the peanut area has  increased 3 percent.    The cultural and social spheres have made clear progress,  too. Based on satisfactorily implementing the resolution of the  Third Plenum of the CPV Central Committee, the province has  implemented the resolutions of the fourth and fifth plenums of  the CPV Central Committee, guided the sectors and echelons in  formulating work programs, solved the urgent social problems,  and improved the quality of the activities of the village  literary blocks. What is worth noting is that the program to  eliminate poverty has achieved good results and had a practical  effect. The echelons, sectors, mass organizations, and people  have responded to the movements, and many assets (of the state,  social organizations, and people) have been mobilized. Most of  the poor households now have capital to carry on production and  engage in commercial and service activities. These households  are being stabilized, and their standard of living is gradually  rising. The number of poor households in the province has  clearly declined. Today, the assets of this program have reached  50 billion dong. A total of 23,215 households have been given  loans and provided jobs in production, business, and service  occupations. The number of households that lack food is  declining daily.    Although this is a complex area where the enemy continues to  implement plots to destroy the revolution, because the echelons  and sectors in Tay Ninh have concentrated on providing  leadership and guidance and invested much in security and  national defense work, political security, order, and social  safety here has been maintained. There have not been any major  disturbances recently, and the evil plots of the destructive  groups have been discovered and blocked in time. During the past  period, social evils have declined greatly.    The initial results achieved by Tay Ninh in building the  party prove that:    Renovating and reorganizing the party must also be tied to  stabilizing and developing the economy and society and  maintaining security and national defense. Solidifying the  primary-level party organizations and improving the quality of  the party members must go hand in hand with solving the pressing  problems in the localities and at the bases.    In order to have a suitable plan of action, an all-around  survey must be conducted from the party bases. The people must  be allowed to contribute ideas to and discuss the action  programs so that they can implement the programs along with the  party. This will help create a close relationship between the  party and the people.    Cadre work is always the key element in party renovation and  reorganization. We must understand the cadres and party members,  know the strengths and weaknesses of each person, formulate  plans for recruiting, training, assigning, and using people, and  have suitable compensation procedures and policies in order to  create the conditions and mobilize people to satisfy the new  needs of the revolution.    At present, Tay Ninh still has many difficulties, but the  results that we have achieved in the past period have generated  momentum for the next steps on the path of carrying on  renovation.</p>

			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Investment income behind profits rise at Munich Re LOSSES in mainstream reinsurance business improved only slightly from the very high levels of last year, Munich Re reported, although income from capital investments enabled the group to improve overall profits substantially in the year ended June 1992. At the parent company - which accounts for some 80 per cent of group business - the reinsurance loss was DM922.5m (Dollars 578.7m), down from DM962.3m in 1990-1991. Mr Horst Jannott, chief executive, blamed the scale of these losses chiefly on large claims in the European fire insurance sector, as well on natural disasters such as Typhoon Mireille which caused Dollars 5.2bn damage to Japan in September 1991. In the parent company, income from capital investments rose to DM1.98bn from DM1.69bn in the previous year. This helped ensure that profits for the group as a whole rose to DM177.6m in 1991-1992 compared with DM104.9m. Group premium income rose by 11.3 per cent to DM15.8bn and the dividend for this year would once again be DM10 per share, Mr Jannott said. He said that the group would once again report reinsurance losses in the current year, partly because of Hurricane Andrew which hit the US at the end of August, but also because of industrial fire risks and the sharply increased number of car thefts in Germany. But this would be compensated for by investment income and it was likely that the dividend for 1992-1993 would also be DM10 a share. The impetus for turnover growth last year came from expansion into the eastern part of Germany, with the result that parent company domestic fee income rose by 12.6 per cent. Mr Jannott warned that this year's fee income figures would be hit by the translation effects of a higher D-Mark.</p>

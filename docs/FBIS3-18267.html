At a meeting  in Saxony, leading members of two banned neo-Nazi parties, the  German Alternative and the National Offensive, decided to  establish an electors' initiative for the Republikaner together  with the Hamburg National List, which is facing a possible ban  by the Federal Constitutional Court. According to Christian  Worch, leader of the National List, the neo-Nazis are "grimly  determined" to "make important impacts" on the election  campaign. The Republikaner, who are careful to disassociate  themselves from the neo-Nazi scene in the public's eye, have  threatened to take legal action against the unwanted neo-Nazi  helpers. This does not trouble Worch: "Legally, Schoenhuber is  completely powerless against demonstrations of sympathy."</p>

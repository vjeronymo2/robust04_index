			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / Nadir investigator 'probed tax affairs of minister' THE Inland Revenue investigator blamed by Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive businessman, for his downfall also probed the tax affairs of a government minister, it is claimed today. Mr Michael Allcock headed the Revenue's crack investigative unit Special Office 2, known as The Ghostbusters. SO2 probed the tax affairs of wealthy City businessmen including Mr Nadir, who jumped bail in May and fled to northern Cyprus. Mr Allcock was suspended from the Revenue last September, and was arrested and questioned by police last month but released without charges. In an interview with ITV's World In Action, to be screened tonight, Mr Allcock tells how a stockbroker informant tipped him off that a government minister was implicated in offshore tax frauds. Mr Allcock says he tried to examine the politician's tax files before he was suspended. However, Mr Allcock refuses to name the minister. 'I cannot comment on that,' he says, adding that although he is suspended he is 'still a civil servant and it is quite improper for me to talk about individual cases'. Mr Allcock also tells how his team launched a large-scale investigation, named The Stock Exchange Project, into alleged tax dodges by City business people. The dodges involved depositing the profits from share dealings in the accounts of bogus companies based in offshore tax havens. In order to avoid tax, the people involved would bring suitcases full of money back to Britain. Mr Allcock says: 'Somebody would go on a plane, go to Jersey or Switzerland with a briefcase and draw the money in cash and bring it back.'</p>

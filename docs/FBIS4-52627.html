			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 12 KYODO -- The chief of former  coalition bloc new party Sakigake (Harbinger) said Thursday [12  May] there would be a change of power after enactment of the  fiscal 1994 state budget, indicating the administration of Prime  Minister Tsutomu Hata will be short-lived. Masayoshi Takemura  said Hata's minority administration is not in "good shape" and  defined it as a government that takes charge of "certain things"  for a "certain period."    Takemura made the remarks in a campaign speech in front of  the Shimbashi Railway Station in central Tokyo. He was joined  by eight of the party's 15 House of Representatives lawmakers  who also gave speeches.    Sakigake, previously a small body in the seven-party  coalition of former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, left the  coalition last month during the process of picking Hata as  Hosokawa's successor, complaining of the coalition's way of  selecting a new leader. Departure of the leading coalition  Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan, SDPJ] put the Hata  administration on a minority power base.    Political analysts predicted that the Hata cabinet will be  forced to resign en masse or call a snap election of the  powerful lower house as early as June after the Diet legislates  the state budget for the current fiscal year that began April 1.</p>

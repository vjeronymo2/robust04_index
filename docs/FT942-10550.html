			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Sidlaw shares fall 11p as margins are squeezed Shares in Sidlaw fell 11p to 338p after the Scotland-based packaging, oil services and textiles company said it was suffering margin pressure. Turnover leapt from Pounds 71.5m to Pounds 150.4m in the six months to March 31, thanks mainly to a full contribution from the flexible packaging business which it bought for Pounds 79m from Courtaulds last July. Group pre-tax profits rose 49 per cent to Pounds 6.9m and operating profits were 68 per cent higher at Pounds 8.8m. Mr Digby Morrow, chief executive, said he was pleased with the progress made by all three divisions. In particular, the recently acquired flexible packaging business had met expectations so far and had been comfortably integrated. The packaging division's sales rose from Pounds 20m to Pounds 83m and operating profits increased from Pounds 2m to Pounds 5.5m. Although sales and orders held up well, the group said price pressure was relentless and affected profits performance. Oil services increased sales to Pounds 52m (Pounds 34m) and operating profits by 2 per cent to Pounds 3m. The results included a loss of Pounds 274,000 in the Supplylink joint venture set up in 1992 to offer logistics services internationally. Mr Morrow said that he now expected Supplylink to break even next year - a year later than expected. Without that loss, the division would have shown profit growth of 7 per cent. The textiles division increased operating profits by 9 per cent to Pounds 326,000. Earnings per share rose to 9.1p (8.8p) and the interim dividend was 4.5p (4.25p).</p>

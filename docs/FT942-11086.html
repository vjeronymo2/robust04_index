			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Major to fight any challenge to his leadership Mr John Major confronted head-on yesterday the growing threat to his leadership as a shell-shocked Conservative party digested its worst performance for more than 50 years in a nationwide election. Confirmation of the government's rout in Thursday's local elections intensified speculation at Westminster that a similar defeat in the June 9 European elections would spell the end of his premiership. Mr Paddy Ashdown's Liberal Democrats celebrated the biggest gains in the battle for 5,000 council seats contested across the country, adding 388 to their previous total and claiming the party was now winning positive, rather than protest, votes. But Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, said his party's strong showing in once-Tory strongholds around London confirmed it was now poised to win the next general election. The government held its flagship Wandsworth and Westminster councils, but Labour now controls 17 of the capital's 32 boroughs against the Conservatives' four. Defeated in such bastions as Tunbridge Wells, Basildon and Woking, the Conservatives had nationwide losses of 429 seats. The result in Scotland was still more damaging. The Conservatives were driven into fourth place behind Labour, the Scottish National party and the Liberal Democrats. As the final results indicated the Tory share of the overall vote had slumped to 27 per cent - the same as the Liberal Democrats - Mr John Carlisle, a maverick Tory MP, said he was ready to stand in an autumn leadership contest. Other rightwing Conservatives said they had already collected the necessary 34 pledges from backbench colleagues to trigger such a contest. But in a blunt warning that he would not be driven from office by opponents in his own party, Mr Major said he would fight off any challenge. Speaking outside 10 Downing Street before joining the Queen for the formal opening of the Channel tunnel, he dismissed Mr Carlisle's threat. The prime minister pledged a Conservative fightback in the poll for the European Parliament and Mr Major predicted a backlash against his party's dissidents during the campaign. It would not forgive 'anyone who stands on the sidelines or utters a discordant note'. Asked how he would respond to any challenge Mr Major responded briskly: 'If anybody chooses to engage in that fight, they will find me standing there waiting for them.' He added: 'I will meet a challenge whenever it comes.' Cabinet colleagues sought to shore up the prime minister's position with pledges to unite around the the Tory manifesto for the June 9 election. Mr Michael Portillo, the rightwing Treasury minister at the centre of a cabinet row this week over Europe, insisted there was no question of a drive to oust Mr Major. Mr Michael Heseltine, regarded as the most likely successor if Mr Major fell, also urged an end to leadership speculation.

			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer] Fatos Nano has requested that he be  released from detention; Robert Gjini and Hasan Hallko have  asked to be declared innocent; and Sokrat Plaka has not  presented any request to the Appeals Court. To learn more about  today's hearing on the appeal of these defendants, let us hear  the report by our correspondent Armir Shkurti:    [Shkurti] The examination of the criminal case of the  defendants Fatos Nano, Robert Gjini, and Hasan Hallko began in  the Appeals Court this morning. Following the decision of the  Tirana Court on 3 April this year, on the basis of the law,  today the three defendants and their defense counsel presented  the reasons for their complaints against the verdict of the  Tirana Court. Fatos Nano and Robert Gjini were present in  court, while defendant Hasan Hallko was in the hospital with a  serious case of depression.    Perparim Sanxhaku, counsel for defendant Fatos Nano,  declared  in front of reporters that he had no complaints against the  bench of this court, made up of Prele Martini, chairman of the  Appeals Court, Koco Mano, and Mergim Dragushi. The prosecutor  is Petrit Duka. Mano read the verdict of the Tirana Court.    In a 70-page statement, Counsel Sanxhaku brought forward  arguments that the verdict of the court of first instance was  unjust. The defense case appears to be based on reports  referring to the actions and documentation prepared in Italy.  According to Sanxhaku, an approximately 500-page report  contained in the file is in Italian and has not been translated  in Albanian. Some 200 of the approximately 470 pages of the  Italian experts' report are missing, the counsel said. Sanxhaku  insisted that the Italian aid amounted to 20 and not 23 billion  lira, as stated in the verdict. Sanxhaku asked that the  indictment be addressed to Pergniola, as he has directly  profited from the money.    The counsel asked the court to rescind the arrest warrant  against defendant Fatos Nano, include in the file the documents  that are missing, and translate those that are in Italian.  Sanxhaku also requested that the case be returned to the Tirana  Court for completion of the investigation.    Defendant Nano began his statement with a political  discussion in which he called himself a victim of the political  struggle. He said the trial was a point of reference for  international states and organizations considering Albania.  Nano believes that financing from these organizations would  depend on the position that the judicary maintained toward him.    The chairman of the court warned the defendant several times  that if he continued the political discussion rather than  present his evidence, his speech would be interrupted. This  appeared to convince Nano and he continued by defending himself,  essentially with the same arguments as his counsel, but again  from the position of a politician.    Roland Permeti, counsel for defendant Robert Gjini, used  almost the same arguments and logic as put forward in the  defense in the court of first instance. The statement is not a  document of payment and material responsibility. Albkontrol was  the one that checked the items and Workshop No. 101/K of the  State Reserves was directly responsible for receiving the items.    Defendant Robert Gjini added few things to the defense of  his  counsel. The counsel for defendant Hasan Hallko defended him in  almost the same way. His client had authorized the counsel to  speak on his behalf, as he himself was in hospital. Gjini and  Hallko pleaded innocent.    Nano's counsel submitted 10 requests to the court. The court  turned down the request to requestion 11 witnesses, reexamine  the experts' report by experts Telegrafi and Shkreli, produce  the minutes on the interrogation of Fatos Nano at the  Investigation Office, and produce the price bulletin from the  Chamber of Commerce in Milan, as well as the request to  translate 500 pages from Italian and produce the reports of  petitions, letters, and demands to release Fatos Nano. They  acceded to the request to produce all the documentation that has  not been produced so far and investigate all the documentation  that the counsel thought was not assessed in the trial of first  instance.    Counsel Sanxhaku presented several documents not produced so  far, which the court will consider. Prosecutor Duka asked for  time to consider the documents, while the counsels of the  defendants said they would condition their final statements on  the prosecutor's statement. The hearing was interrupted and  will continue at 0900 tomorrow.</p>

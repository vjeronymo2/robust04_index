			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIXING FACT AND FICTION IN NORTHEAST TENNESSEE  </P> <P> Near the community of Trade, population about 40, a beautiful antebellum white  mansion sprawls across the top of a small knoll in the midst of rolling green  hill. David O. Selznick could have used it for Tara in "Gone With the Wind." A  local citizen caught our astonished looks and laughed.  </P> <P> "Pretty nice spread for us hillbillies, isn't it?" she asked.  </P> <P> Old myths and stereotypes die hard. People still envision poverty-stricken,  bare-foot farmers smoking corn-cob pipes when they talk about this corner of  southern Appalachia in northeastern Tennessee.  </P> <P> The citizens of this historic mountain country take it all in stride. And while  they're a tolerant lot who even make fun of that hardscrabble farmer image,  they're also loyal Tennesseans who are fiercely proud of their heritage.  </P> <P> This is the land of America's first frontier, where westward migration began in  the 18th Century. Daniel Boone set off from here with his 30 ax-men to cut the  Wilderness Trail into Kentucky.  </P> <P> The first constitution ever written by Americans was drafted here. The first  territorial capitol was established here. Davy Crockett was born here.  </P> <P> America's seventh President, Andrew Jackson, practiced law in Jonesborough,  Tennessee's oldest town.  </P> <P> Nowadays, Jonesborough has gained notoriety as the home of the National  Storytelling Festival, held for three days during the first full weekend in  October.  </P> <P> The festival began in 1973, the creation of Jonesborough's former mayor, Jimmy  Neil Smith, who invited five storytellers to tell tales from the back of a hay  wagon to about 60 listeners. Today, storytellers come from around the world.  This year, more than 6,000 people are expected to hear them when the festival  is held Oct. 5-7.  </P> <P> Jonesborough is the first town in the United States to be entered on the  National Register as a designated historic district. Chartered in 1779 (before  there was even a Tennessee), Jonesborough has survived Cherokee Indian attacks,  the Revolution and the Civil War.  </P> <P> Much of the town looks as it did a century ago, with handsomely restored old  buildings, cluttered antique shops and churches dating back to the 1840s.  </P> <P> Andrew Jackson lived here when he was a young lawyer, boarding in a log cabin  that has been restored and relocated on Main Street, which was once the Great  Stage Road between Nashville and Washington, D.C.  </P> <P> Jackson was threatened with a tar-and-feathering in his younger days, just down  the block at the Chester Inn, which dates to 1797. Later, he returned and  hosted a great reception there during his presidency.  </P> <P> The inn is undergoing restoration, and is soon to be the official home and  museum of the National Association for the Preservation and Perpetuation of  Storytelling (NAPPS).  </P> <P> Every small town in this historic corner of Tennessee, or at least some part of  it, seems to be either a National Historic Landmark or on the National Register  of Historic Places. The townspeople live in houses listed in the National  Register. Their homes are featured in national magazines, their furniture so  exquisite they are asked to loan it to museums for display. So much for that  hillbilly image.  </P> <P> Millions of visitors pass by this area every year on their way to the Great  Smoky Mountains National Park, 80 miles south. They miss a lot.  </P> <P> A short detour off Interstate 81 takes visitors along winding scenic country  roads, past lakes, rivers, state parks or into the Cherokee National Forest to  the east. Historic cities and towns, crammed with things to see and do, skirt  both sides of the busy highway.  </P> <P> In 1965, potter Nancy Patterson Lamb, who trained in Los Angeles and perfected  her craft at Finland's Arabia pottery works and Denmark's Royal Copenhagen,  founded Iron Mountain Stoneware in the hamlet of Laurel Bloomery, near the  junction of the Virginia and North Carolina borders. The transplanted  Californian has been there ever since, selling her products across the country  -- to places such as Tiffany's in New York and Gump's in San Francisco.  </P> <P> Just up the road from Jonesborough, off Highway 321, more history-making events  took place at Sycamore Shoals in Elizabethton, site of the first permanent  settlement outside the original 13 colonies.  </P> <P> The first constitution ever written by Americans (even before the Declaration  of Independence) was drafted there, and the largest land purchase in our  nation's history, the Transylvania Purchase, took place at Ft. Watauga, when  Richard Henderson bought 20 million acres from the Cherokee Indians for a  paltry 10,000.  </P> <P> The reconstructed fort stands near the Watauga River, part of the Sycamore  Shoals State Historic Area. Other worthwhile visits in Elizabethton are the  1780 Carter Mansion, one of the oldest houses remaining in Tennessee, and, for  fans of covered bridges, the still-in-use, l34-foot wooden structure crossing  the Doe River.  </P> <P> At Piney Flats, less then 10 miles away, a log house known as Rocky Mount  served as the first territorial capitol in the United States when President  Washington appointed William Blount as territorial governor in 1790.  </P> <P> Rocky Mount is now a living-history museum, where interpreters dressed in  authentic costumes re-create life as it was when Mr. and Mrs. William Cobb, the  original owners, lived there.  </P> <P> Visitors are greeted as if they are friends who have come to call for a Sunday  visit, and Mrs. Cobb leads guests through her home and shows off her "purdy"  furniture and "necessary chair" (commode), punctuating her gossip about the  neighbors with frequent "mercy sakes" declarations.  </P> <P> When Daniel Boone set out to cross the Cumberland Gap in 1775, the area of  Kingsport was still part of North Carolina. The city wasn't established until  1802 when William King built a boat yard on the Holston River.  </P> <P> Exchange Place, a restored 19th-Century pioneer farm homestead in Kingsport,  was another major stop where travelers exchanged horses and currency along the  Great Stage Road. Today, visitors are treated to crafts demonstrations and  tours of the eight buildings (six are original) on the grounds, including a  blacksmith shop and smokehouse.  </P> <P> If historic houses and architecture are your passion, take a run south on  Highway 11W to Rogersville, another small town on the Great Stage Road. Founded  in 1789, Rogersville claims 35 sites on the National Register, from churches  and mansions to a railroad depot.  </P> <P> It's worth the trip just to stop in (for a meal or for the night) at the Hale  Springs Inn, which has been serving travelers since it was built in 1824.  You'll find an 1889 guest book in the lobby, as well as the original  wainscoting, chair rails, pine plank floors and Colonial furniture.  </P> <P> The streets of Greeneville, founded in 1783, are still lined with gracious  antebellum homes. The town claims America's l7th President, Andrew Johnson, as  its most famous resident. The much-maligned Johnson (he was the only President  to have articles of impeachment brought against him) came to Greeneville from  North Carolina as a l7-year-old in 1826 and died there in 1875.  </P> <P> Just east of Greeneville, the 63-acre Davy Crockett Birthplace State Park,  including a reproduction of the log cabin in which he was born, runs along the  banks of the Nolichuckey River. (Crockett was not born on a mountaintop,  contrary to what Walt Disney Studiosmay have depicted.)  </P> <P> If you feel a need to unwind after all this historic touring, one perfect spot  would be Roan Mountain State Resort Park, with its lofty meadows, wildflowers,  gardens, conifer forest and impressive views of the Blue Ridge Range.  </P> <P> There's also a preserved homestead, settled in 1878, in the park on Strawberry  Mountain. The caretaker, grandson of the original homesteader, will sit on the  front porch with visitors and reminisce. It's like being on Walton's Mountain.  Any moment you expect to hear Mary Beth or Erin call out "Night, John."  </P> <P> If you're really lucky, you might catch Jim Miller playing his hammered  dulcimer on a balmy summer evening in the park. The music ("It's bluegrass, not  country; there's a difference, you know," says Miller) is so sweet it can bring  tears to your eyes.  </P> <P> Hillbilly music, some people say.  </P> <P> Beautiful music.  </P></p>

			<p>Intake   <F P=102>   94FE0357A Tokyo KOGIKEN NYUSU in Japanese Oct 93 pp 2-3 </F> <F P=103> 94FE0357A </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo KOGIKEN NYUSU </F> <F P=105>  Japanese </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Kimio Sakata and Shigemi Shindo, Engine </F> Department, National Aerospace Laboratory]    [Text] As part of joint academic-private sector element  research on a turbo propulsion system for the space plane and  supersonic/ultra-supersonic plane, research is being conducted  at the National Aerospace Laboratory on supersonic intake in  two-dimensional mixed compression form. The goal of this  research is two-dimensional variable form intake up to mach 5  (focusing mainly on mach 3). Up to now, overall tests have been  conducted, such as supersonic wind tunnel tests, partial element  model tests, basic aerodynamic tests and CFD. In this article we  will introduce the results of tests concerning improvements to  the subsonic diffuser aimed at improving the intake's pressure  recovery performance.    The following are some of the reasons for the loss that  arises between the subsonic diffuser and the area near the  throat where vertical shock waves occur:    (1) Interference between vertical shock waves and wall  surface boundary layer;    (2) flow separation inside the subsonic diffuser;    (3) growth of corner eddies inside the subsonic diffuser.    This loss accounts for a relatively large part of intake  losses, and it became clear that the subsonic diffuser flow  path, including the air bleed in the throat section, had to be  improved. Thus model tests using a small-scale continuous type  mach 2 supersonic wind tunnel (supersonic heat transfer wind  tunnel) were carried out to improve subsonic diffusers with  vertical shock waves.    Tests were conducted on five models to clarify the effect of  entry mach differences (M[.sub]1[/]=1.9, 1.35) and pressure  gradient. Figure 1 shows a representative part of test sections  and models and Photo 1 is an external view of an entry mach 1.35  wind tunnel test section.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-43A>      Figure 1:  Subsonic Diffuser Models </FIG>    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-44A>      Photo 1: External View of Diffuser Model (Low Mach Model) Connected to Small-Scale Supersonic Wind Tunnel </FIG>     In the model there are boundary layer air bleed holes in the  vertical shock wave upper flow, and in the low mach test  section, slits were made in the throat section to simulate  actual intake.    Here, we will discuss three models: SB-11 (dA/dx=c), with  uniform sectional area change and straight wall composition; and  SB-12 and SB-21, in which mach gradient is set with flow  direction (dM/dx= -0.0018 and -0.0031, respectively). Figure 2  shows experimental results in terms of flow direction pressure  distribution. With model SB-21, which has a low entry mach,  overall pressure recovery is high because vertical shock wave  loss is small, and it was found that a lower loss than the  straight wall model could be achieved by setting the mach  gradient. It is thought that the main factors are: (1) High  pressure gradient near the vertical shock waves encourages  separation; and (2) boundary layer behavior greatly depends on  pressure gradient.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-44B>      Figure 2: Static Pressure Recovery of Each Subsonic Diffuser Model </FIG>     Figure 3 shows the outcome of applying the above results to  the mach 3 intake model. Performance was improved about  12% by  changing pressure gradient (shown graphically in Figure 3 by  squares to triangles), and a target pressure recovery rate of  0.81 (circles in Figure 3) was achieved by eliminating corner  eddies.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-44C>      Figure 3:  Mach 3 Intake Model Pressure Recovery </FIG>     Model testing also is underway on the effect of mach  gradient, shortened diffuser length and three-dimensionality.</p>

			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Hughes attacks damages award Hughes Aircraft, a General Motors subsidiary, described as 'irrational, irresponsible and outrageous' the Dollars 89.5m damages award against the company handed down this week by a Los Angeles jury. In the case, which involves two former Hughes employees, one white and one black, the company was found to have violated fair employment laws. Hughes intends to appeal and legal experts said the award would almost certainly be reduced substantially. The award comes amid a rash of discrimination and harassment suits. In another high profile case the US Labor Department, which is supposed to be a watchdog against workplace discrimination, agreed to pay an estimated Dollars 4.9m to settle a suit that accused the agency of discrimination against its own black employees. Businesses complain that despite efforts to eliminate bias in the workplace, increasingly restrictive laws make it very hard to comply.</p>

			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Finance and the Family: Directors' Transactions DIRECTORS appear undecided about which way to deal, with purchases and sales very evenly balanced. Viscount Rothermere, chairman of the Daily Mail and General Trust, sold 10,000 of the A non-voting shares, realising a little over Pounds 650,000 before expenses. At the same time, he sold a further 12,000 in which he did not have a better financial interest. After these sales, Viscount Rothermere's vehicle still controls more than half the company's shares. The media sector features quite highly this week. Christopher Bland, chairman of LWT Holdings, has sold 84,000 of the convertible cumulative preference, leaving himself with 186,000 preference shares. Unlike its London weekday rivals, LWT retained its franchise in last year's bidding contest. Weir Group has been one of the great success stories in the UK engineering sector, riding out the recession in impressive style. William McLean has sold 38,000 shares at 553p, at which level the shares have doubled since the beginning of 1991. Relative to the market over the last 12 months, they have outperformed by almost 30 per cent.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                              No of Company                    Sector     Shares   Value     directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Allied Textiles              Text      4,000        16           1 BPP                          BuSe     25,000        63           1 BTR                          OthI     75,000       364           1* Candover                     InTr     15,000        34           2 Cresta Care                  Hlth     70,000        17           1 Daily Mail A                  Med     10,000       652           1 Enterprise                    O&amp;G      9,500        41           1 Halstead                     Chem      3,000        14           1 LWT Holdings (CCP)            Med     84,000       214           1 Scottish TV                   Med    200,000       854           1 Weir Group                   EngG     38,000       210           1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ASDA                         FdRe     80,000        29           2 BM Group                     EngG     70,000        42           3 Broadgate                    InTr     16,200        15           2 Cussins                       C&amp;C    208,000        53           1 EL Oro                        n/a      7,500        28           1 Forte                        Hotl     35,000        52           1 Goodhead Group                Med     50,000        16           1 Greenwich Res                Mine    820,800        37           4 Johnston Group               BdMa     20,000        24           1 Morrison (Wm)                FdRe     35,000        47           1 P &amp; O                        Tran     10,000        39           1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / People: Berrill is latest departure from Henderson Robin Berrill, 33, a main board director of fund mangers Henderson Administration and architect of its show jumping sponsorship policy, resigned yesterday less than a week after the company announced it intended to acquire Touche Remnant, the investment trust manager. Berrill, whose responsibilities included the marketing of investment trusts and Personal Equity Plans, quit after Henderson's chairman failed to reassure him about his future there. Touche Remnant's chief executive, Paul Manduca, has expertise in a similar area and is expected to assume at least some of those duties when the two firms merge. Indeed, Henderson was said to have informally approached Manduca about a job some months back but was unable to agree a suitable package. Berrill is believed to have left with a handshake worth roughly Pounds 100,000. Berrill is the latest in a string of departures from Henderson which is struggling to overcome the haemorrhage of pension fund clients after its particularly poor investment performance in 1987 and 1988. Recent pension fund performance has been above average but moves to strengthen management internally by bringing in fresh faces have not all sat well with the existing team, industry insiders say. Earlier this year, Henderson brought in Ian Buckley from Sun Life to head its investment division - a move believed to have prompted the departure of Robin Hindle-Fisher to Phillips &amp; Drew Fund Management. Meanwhile, the remaining question is the future of Henderson'sponsorship of show jumping, a sport with a declining number of corporate patrons. Henderson said yesterday that the company's investment in the sport is 'substantially less' than the Pounds 500,000 reported but it will be reviewed at year end. 'We are very happy with our sponsorship so far' says Henderson.</p>

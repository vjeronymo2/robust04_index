			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Counterterrorism Directorate (Dincote)  budget has been considerably reduced in the last few months. As  a result, operational and intelligence services by this  specialized unit in its fight against the Shining Path and the  Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) have decreased  considerably. Various sources consulted have asserted that,  compared with previous years, the budget has been reduced 30 to  40 percent.    It also has been reported that the number of trips to the  provinces usually taken by Dincote members have been reduced to  only extremely necessary ones, like when the presence of 2d  Counterterrorism Intelligence Division (Divicote-2) personnel  was requested in Trujillo. This operation ended with the arrest  of six important MRTA leaders. Aside from this, no trips have  been taken to the interior.    Until 1993, personnel from different Divicotes and even the  so-called "Delta" Group frequently traveled to the interior.  Their trips yielded good results and several members of regional  MRTA directorates, who also belonged to the MRTA national board,  were arrested.    Budget cutbacks are also affecting the serious and patient  intelligence work (basic pursuits) by Dincote detectives. They  said: "Now the chiefs are recommending we do not spend more than  the indispensable expenses. Nonetheless, if we do not risk some  expenses, we will not be able to succeed. If we had followed  orders, we would not have arrested Abimael Guzman and his  leaders. Sometimes we have to grope in the dark until we are  able to obtain important information."    It also has been reported that, so far, almost 30  high-ranking officials have been appointed to the National  Intelligence Service (SIN), including those comprising  Divicote-1 or the Special Intelligence Groups (GEIN) that  captured Abimael Guzman.    They have explained that only now, with the presence of  these  specialized detectives, is SIN really conducting intelligence  work and supplying appropriate information to the operational  units that conduct the required raids.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] SUVA, Feb 1 (AFP) -- Any prospect of a coalition  after next month's election between between Fiji's governing  Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei (SVT) and the Indian dominated  opposition has been ruled out by both sides, former opposition  leader Jai Ram Reddy made clear Tuesday.    SVT leader and outgoing Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka told  a  political rally here Monday he would not entertain a coalition  with an Indian political party if his party won the general  election. Rabuka blamed a "bad experience" with the  Indian-dominated Fiji Labour Party (FLP) after the 1992 general  election, when it supported his candidacy for the prime  ministership.    Rabuka said FLP leader Mahendra Chaudhry had made  uncompromising demands on the SVT which he later could not  honour. These included the review of what Chaudry described as  the "racist 1990 Constitution" which gave indigenous Fijians a  parliamentary majority of 37 seats in a 70-seat House of  Rpresentatives and the abolition of a value added tax (VAT).    National Federation Party (NFP) leader Jai Ram Reddy  responded sharply Tuesday saying it was Rabuka who had talked  about coalition with the NFP in the past. Reddy, who was leader  of the opposition in the last House of Representatives, had  supported Rabuka's plan for a government of national unity  announced in November 1992. A committee of which Reddy was a  member sat on several occasions to look into the issue but  nothing eventuated.    In his response Tuesday, Reddy said in a statement that his  party's priority was "to secure as many Indian seats as possible  and to press for the review of the 1990 Constitution through  dialogue with the Fijian leaders." Reddy said he had repeatedly  warned since 1992 of the dangers of becoming locked under the  present constitution into a coalition which he said could become  "embarrassing if no progress was made on the review (of the  constitution) satisfactory to the party."    It was therefore academic for Rabuka to rule out a coalition  with the NFP, Reddy said. "The NFP has no intention of repeating  the mistake that the Fiji Labour Party made in 1992," he added.</p>

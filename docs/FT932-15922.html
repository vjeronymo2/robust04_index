			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Observer: Electric shock The habits of a boring old utility have been clearly left behind by the biggest of the UK's hived-off electricity generators, National Power. After a mere couple of years in the private sector, it is switching its advisers on and off with unseemly speed. Out goes Lazard Brothers as principal financial adviser and in comes J Henry Schroder Wagg, while County NatWest has been dumped as joint broker and replaced by Smith New Court. However, even National Power didn't feel brave enough to turn off Cazenove, its other joint broker. Presumably the privatised generator is lining up ambitious corporate plans. Schroder's knows more about regulation than most, and Smith New Court has the number one research analyst in the sector. But will Smith ever again issue a sell note on its biggest blue chip client?</p>

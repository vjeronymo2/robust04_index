			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Piotr Aleksandrowicz: "Business Community Does </F> Not Approve of Waldemar Pawlak; Social Research Institute for  RZECZPOSPOLITA; Company Managers Critical, Concerned Over  Government Policies"]    [Text] Just 9 percent of managers of Polish companies  approve of the way Waldemar Pawlak has been performing as prime  minister. Fifty-five percent of company owners, managers,  chairmen, and their deputies do not approve of Pawlak's  performance, while over one-third has no opinion on the issue.  The prime minister enjoys only a marginally better approval  rate from the state-owned sector (12 percent in favor, 49  percent against), whereas, with regard to the cooperative  sector, the approval rate is more or less the same as the  average. Such are the results obtained from a poll conducted in  February by the Social Research Institute, despite the fact that  evaluations of the climate for making money are getting better  and better.    The results of this research involving a group of more than  500 managers of companies, which is another in a series (fourth  in a row), are clearly different from responses obtained during  a survey conducted among Poles generally. During a poll of  citizens at large conducted in mid-February, 36 percent agreed  with the way the prime minister performs his job, whereas 35  percent disagreed. In March, the prime minister's approval  ratings suffered a slight deterioration (33 percent approve, 37  percent do not), but these results are definitely better than  those obtained during polls of economic leaders. The prime  minister's social support basis consists of senior citizens,  residents of rural areas, farmers, and the least educated  people. The business community is against him, and so are  people with higher educations, the young, and city residents.  <H5>  They Would Prefer Another Prime Minister </H5>   So it is no wonder that, while responding to another  question  of the survey (which is Poland's only representative poll of  company owners and managers), only between 10 and 20 company  managers (3.5 percent) said that, in their view, Pawlak would be  the best prime minister from the standpoint of the entire  economy and of their respective companies. In February of this  year, the top consisted of Kwasniewski and Suchocka (each with  11 percent of the voters) and Balcerowicz (9 percent). Apart  from them, Pawlak was beaten by Olechowski (7 percent) and  Borowski and Korwin-Mikke (4 percent each). The current prime  minister suffered a loss compared with December 1992, when 5  percent of the polled company managers were in favor of him.  Olechowski and Balcerowicz clearly suffered their own losses in  that time period (by a few percentage points); Suchocka suffered  a minor loss, while Kwasniewski gained the most (a jump from 2  percent).  <H5>  Government Is Not Approved, Either </H5>   The rate of approval, or rather of disapproval, for the  government is (in the poll of company managers) identically the  same as for the prime minister (within the statistical  error)--that is to say, it is also very low. Ten percent of  company owners, managers, chairmen, and their deputies approve  of the way the government does its job, whereas 53 percent do  not approve. In this case, managers of companies in the private  sector are the most critical, but the differences are minor, and  they are mostly due to an increased percentage of the undecided  among managers in the cooperative and state-owned sectors. Also  in these sectors, it is hard to find signs of approval.    It is a characteristic trait that neither Pawlak nor the  government as a whole is approved of by those managers who voted  for the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] or the Democratic Left  Alliance in the September elections. Because there were  relatively few company managers who voted for the PSL to begin  with, the margin of error may be slightly higher than usual, but  there is no doubt that the business community is satisfied  neither with Pawlak nor with the government. Those managers who  during the elections voted for the parties currently in power  are not satisfied, either. At most, there is a somewhat greater  confusion for that reason among managers who are left-wing,  compared with the rest of the managerial group.   <H5>    Economy Opposed to Authorities </H5>   The question arises: What is the reason for this phenomenon?  Our research provides plenty of data in that regard, requiring  thorough analysis--and we will do that. What can be seen  immediately is the fact that company managers are critical of  the prime minister and the government, despite a positive  assessment of the economic climate, generally speaking.    Currently, as many as 61 percent of the polled company  managers think that there is a climate for making money in  Poland. In June 1993, the proportion was 53 percent, whereas,  in December 1992, it was 49 percent. The improvement in the  economic microclimate, which can be seen in forecasts of higher  sales or higher profitability of the managers' companies, among  others, is accompanied by current views of worse prospects for  the entire Polish economy than was the case in the middle of  last year. So the company managers are most probably convinced  that their companies will be developing in spite of the  authorities that are making mistakes and conducting policies not  conducive to the economy as a whole.    There are more reasons to think the proposition is  true--namely, in response to another question, those polled  expressed their concern over the government's economic policies  more often than they did a few months ago (22 percent currently,  17 percent in June 1993). But, in all fairness, that was not  the issue that was listed as the most important. More often,  there was talk about the companies' internal problems,  inflation, and the changing legal provisions.  <H5>  Barriers for Development </H5>   But, with regard to another question, one about what the  greatest obstacles are to developing businesses, there were  increases by a few more points regarding the changing legal  provisions and the high taxes; these, after all, are issues that  are directly up to the government to decide.    They were listed most frequently already in the past, but  right now the percentage of company owners who complain about  them reached 70 percent, when it comes to the changing legal  provisions, and it exceeded 50 percent with regard to tax  levels. Perhaps it is the wave of changes in legal provisions  associated with the new team coming to power (these changes were  partially prepared by the previous government) and more tax  raises that are the reason for the reluctant attitude toward the  authorities in power since the fall of last year.    We also asked company managers about their approval or  disapproval regarding a few specific issues relative to the  economy. Only government measures in issues like privatization  enjoyed a higher approval rating than a disapproval rating (57  percent and 34 percent, respectively). Regarding other issues  that we asked about, lack of approval clearly prevailed. And so  the ratios of approving managers to disapproving ones, regarding  government measures, were as follows on the following issues:  taxes--15 to 79 percent; customs duties and compensatory  payments--31 to 55 percent; price policies and inflation--18 to  73 percent; and salary policies--20 to 66 percent.  <H5>  More Than Just Numbers </H5>   From the standpoint of election arithmetic, the results of  the poll are not very significant. In Poland, there are fewer  economic units (including one-person partnerships) than there  are agricultural farms, whereas there are slightly over 100,000  companies employing at least five persons (which is the kind  included in our poll). Despite that, it is obvious that the  poll results constitute a serious warning to both the governing  coalition and the prime minister personally, and that is due to  the specific position and power enjoyed by entrepreneurs and  company managers, the economy's leaders.  <H6>  * * * </H6>   The poll was conducted by the Sopot-based Social Research  Institute between 14 and 26 February, using a sample of 516  managers (as chiefs or their deputies) in companies employing at  least five persons. Seventy percent of the respondents were  managers in charge of privately owned companies, while managers  in charge of state-owned and cooperative companies constituted  15 percent each.</p>

			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Boundaries of assisted areas are to be reviewed THE BOUNDARIES of assisted areas are to be reviewed, prompting warnings that the move may lead to a reduction in government financial assistance to the regions. A consultation paper, accompanying the announcement by Mr Tim Sainsbury, the industry minister, said: 'It is unlikely that the coverage of the new map will be greater than now, and it could be somewhat less.' Specialists in regional policy noted yesterday that government financial assistance had been steadily declining. They warned that a review of the boundaries of assisted areas was likely to accentuate that trend. The assisted areas map defines the geographical areas where, under regional policy, industrial incentives can be paid to companies. There are two sorts of assisted areas - development and intermediate - denoting the extent of subsidies that can be paid. Such financial assistance cost Pounds 642.6m in the 1986-87 financial year, but had declined to Pounds 264.4m by 1991-92. During the 1980s, automatic entitlements to regional aid were phased out, and subsidies have become discretionary on a project-by-project basis. Assisted areas cover 35 per cent of the UK working population and, except for parts of Cornwall and Devon, are concentrated north of a line drawn from the Severn to the Wash. In its review of the areas to be included on a new map, the government will take into account factors such as un-employment and future economic performance. Mr Keith Hayton, senior lecturer at Strathclyde University's centre for planning, suggested that 'the core assisted areas' such as parts of Scotland, north-east England, the Welsh valleys and the western tip of Cornwall would remain on the map. The government promised a review of the map during the present session of parliament as far back as 1988, and European Community competition rules mean that any changes will have to be negotiated with Brussels. The new map should be published early next year.</p>

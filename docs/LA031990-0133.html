			<p><P> March 19, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY VOICES LITERACY;  </P> <P> FOR MOST, ILLITERACY REMAINS HIDDEN  </P> <P> "The most important thing I learned was that I'm not stupid!"  </P> <P> These words were written by an Orange County resident who, at that time, had  been in literacy classes for 1 1/2 years. She had always wanted to learn to  read, but it was not until she was 40 years old that she got the courage to do  something about it.  </P> <P> While watching the movie "Bluffing It," she was reminded of herself. She had  been bluffing it for 30 years. It was a handicap in everything she did. It  stopped her from going places, ordering in restaurants, reading her Bible,  personal letters, everything.  </P> <P> She tried public adult education, but because of the large class sizes, it  didn't work for her. Then she began attending volunteer classes offered by the  Central Orange County Literacy Council and, for the first time in her life, was  learning to read and write. She is now a nurse's aide.  </P> <P> The story of this Orange County woman has a happy ending, but not all Orange  County's illiterates are so fortunate. It is conservatively estimated that of  the more than 2.2 million people in Orange County, more than 100,000 adults are  functionally illiterate.  </P> <P> There are many different definitions of illiteracy. Is it a total inability to  read or write anything? Is it less than a fifth-grade reading level? Is it less  than an eighth-grade reading level?  </P> <P> When an individual's reading and writing abilities are inadequate for him to  function competently in today's print-oriented world, that individual is, for  all practical purposes, functionally illiterate.  </P> <P> The literacy requirements for today's high-tech civilization are well above  those of even a few decades ago. Many people with formerly adequate skills are  in a precarious position.  </P> <P> The problem remains hidden for most. Would you willingly admit to your best  friend -- never mind your boss -- that you can't do a particular job of paper  work because you can't read well enough? The stigma is too great.  </P> <P> Most illiterates' ways of hiding their problems serve them fairly well up to a  point. But what if they are offered a promotion involving more reading and  writing than they can handle? They are likely to find an excuse not to take it  or quit rather than reveal their "terrible secret."  </P> <P> Why can't these people read and write? Why didn't they learn as children as the  rest of us did?  </P> <P> Some children have trouble learning by the methods used in many schools. They  don't qualify for special help, and many classrooms are overcrowded. Some  children have undiagnosed hearing and vision problems. Because of difficulty at  home, some children do not learn. Some families move a great deal, and an  elementary school child can lose six months with each school change. Children  of migrant workers are especially hard hit. Some had illiterate parents who  passed on their indifference to the value of learning to their children.  </P> <P> Illiterate people come from a variety of social and educational backgrounds.  Some are economically secure and often have high school diplomas. Some are  regularly employed without diplomas and with low basic skills. Others are  irregularly employed with almost no marketable skills. As many as 80% of all  juveniles who appear in court are functionally illiterate, as are more than 65%  of incarcerated adults.  </P> <P> How can you recognize people who are low-level or non-readers? Their methods of  hiding their problem can be ingenious. They become very adept at memorizing.  Some excuses they use are: "I'll have my wife look at the form." "I left my  glasses at home." "I don't have time to help my children with homework." "I  don't have time to read this form now." "My handwriting is bad."  </P> <P> When referring a friend or acquaintance to a literacy class, focus on the  opportunity to improve his reading and writing, not to learn to read or write.  I would suggest you call the Central Orange County Literacy Center first to  verify hours, days and location before approaching the subject.  </P> <P> Be sensitive to the feelings of these low-level or non-reading individuals.  Treat the situation matter-of-factly and openly with a positive and supportive  attitude.  </P></p>

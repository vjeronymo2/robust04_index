			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LABOR SECRETARY DOLE QUITS CABINET  </P> <P> Labor Secretary Elizabeth Hanford Dole today became the first member of  President Bush's Cabinet to resign, saying she wanted to turn her attention to  humanitarian concerns by heading the American Red Cross.  </P> <P> "It is with real deep regret that I accept this resignation, but let me hasten  to say I understand her desire to continue her public service as president of  the American Red Cross," Bush told reporters at the White House as Dole stood  at his side.  </P> <P> Dole, 54, plans to leave her post at the end of November to begin work at the  Red Cross in January, Labor Department spokeswoman Dale Tate said. Her first  project there will involve disaster relief.  </P> <P> A North Carolina native married to Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas  -- who unsuccessfully sought the Republican presidential nomination against  Bush in 1988 -- she dismissed speculation that she may seek the Republican  nomination for North Carolina governor in 1992.  </P> <P> "I'm on my way to the Red Cross," Dole told reporters. "I have no plans to run  for anything."  </P> <P> She has served in government for the last 25 years, holding jobs in every  presidential Administration since that of Lyndon B. Johnson.  </P> <P> She said she was leaving government because she "felt a calling to join" an  organization performing charitable acts.  </P> <P> "The Labor Department is the peoples' department, and what we have tried to do  there is to use the power of the Labor Department to empower people with the  skills they need, with safety on the job and with security of their pensions in  their retirement years," Dole told reporters.  </P> <P> President Bush said: "After a quarter-century of service to this country,  Elizabeth Dole has earned the respect of the American people, and as secretary  of labor she has made the workplace safer, healthier and more secure."  </P></p>

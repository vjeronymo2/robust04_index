			<p><P> December 28, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAGHDAD SAYS IT'S READY FOR SERIOUS TALKS;  </P> <P> IRAQ: BUT HUSSEIN WON'T BEND ON LINKING THE PALESTINIAN ISSUE TO CRISIS. SENIOR  DIPLOMATS ARE SENT BACK TO THEIR POSTS.  </P> <P> A group of senior Iraqi diplomats were dispatched back to their overseas posts  Thursday, and the government said it is ready for "serious and constructive  dialogue" to avert war. But officials denied that Iraq is launching a new peace  initiative.  </P> <P> Kuwait's foreign minister said it is too late for peace initiatives in the  Persian Gulf, maintaining that only military force will dislodge Iraq from the  oil-rich emirate that it invaded Aug. 2.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, with less than three weeks remaining before the Jan. 15 U.N.  deadline for Iraq to pull out of Kuwait, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein met  with 20 diplomats who had been recalled to Baghdad, diplomats said on condition  of anonymity. They included Iraq's envoys to the United States, the Soviet  Union and the United Nations.  </P> <P> "We are ready for a serious and constructive dialogue based on mutual respect  and the rejection of the course of hegemony and arrogance which the American  Administration tries to impose on us," the state Iraqi News Agency quoted  Hussein as telling the diplomats.  </P> <P> But Hussein repeated his demand to link an Israeli withdrawal from the West  Bank and Gaza Strip with any Iraqi pullout from Kuwait, the diplomats said. The  United States has rejected any such linkage.  </P> <P> Hussein showed little willingness to compromise on the issue. Iraq is "ready to  take any sacrifice for the battle it wages against the United States and its  allies," the news agency quoted him as saying.  </P> <P> Iraq also denied reports surfacing in recent days that Hussein was preparing a  diplomatic initiative ahead of the Jan. 15 deadline.  </P> <P> The diplomats said the envoys were beginning to leave Iraq on Thursday to  return to their posts overseas.  </P> <P> Hussein met with Soviet Deputy Prime Minister Igor Belousov about the gulf  crisis on Thursday, the Tass news agency said in Moscow. Belousov was also  arranging for Soviet citizens remaining in Iraq who want to leave to be  evacuated by Jan. 10. There were no other details on their discussions.  </P> <P> Kuwait's foreign minister, Sheik Sabah al Ahmed al Sabah, said that only  military force will dislodge Iraq from Kuwait.  </P> <P> "The whole world has given enough time for a peaceful settlement of the gulf  crisis," Sabah told a news conference during a visit to Beijing.  </P> <P> "Whether by the Arab world, whether by the friendly countries, whether by the  Third World countries or by the big powers, it is very late for such (peace)  initiatives. It would not be useful," he said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, thousands of women and children marched past the U.S. Embassy in  Baghdad on Thursday to protest the boarding and diversion of a "peace ship"'  bound for Iraq in defiance of an international blockade.  </P> <P> The freighter Ibn Khaldoon was boarded off Oman on Wednesday by U.S. sailors,  who scuffled with passengers and crew.  </P> <P> The ship, with 200 women peace activists and others aboard, was carrying sugar,  rice, cooking oil and other cargo banned under U.N. sanctions against Iraq.  </P> <P> Iraqi Transport Minister Mohammed Hamza al Zubeidi accused the boarding party  of beating the women activists. But a U.S. Navy spokesman said no evidence of  injuries was found.  </P> <P> The Ibn Khaldoon was being escorted to an undisclosed destination after the  interception.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MEXICAN CONSUL JOINS TALKS ON MIGRANT WOES  </P> <P> The consul general of Mexico met with a cadre of North County leaders Thursday,  showing the increasing concern by officials on both sides of the border over  the growing tension between migrant workers and suburbanites.  </P> <P> In a private home in Encinitas, Hermilo Lopez-Bassols told an assembly of  county, state and legislative representatives that "bilateral cooperation"  would be needed to finance housing for workers living in squalid conditions in  North County.  </P> <P> "It's impossible for just one body of government to solve this problem,"  Lopez-Bassols said. "Solutions and money must come from my government, from  Sacramento, from Washington, from the city and the community."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Result of Growth  </P> <P> Increasingly surrounded by the new subdivisions that are part of the North  County development boom, migrant workers have retreated to their camps of  plywood and cardboard hooches, creating pockets of poverty amid affluence.  </P> <P> Although many of these workers contribute to the North County work force, often  doing domestic labor for its residents, their living conditions have raised the  ire of homeowners and many elected officials.  </P> <P> In the past, angry residents have simply demanded the workers' removal. But,  since many of them are now residing here legally under the federal amnesty law,  such action is no longer a viable option.  </P> <P> "Just like the Irish and other immigrants who have come here, so have these  people," said Oceanside Councilwoman Melba Bishop. "They're here legally, and  that makes them our responsibility."  </P> <P> Many regional leaders have criticized the amnesty law for allowing workers to  stay in the United States while not providing any money to build housing for  them.  </P> <P> "Amnesty is a good idea, but for Congress to have passed it without  </P> <P> enough money for housing was a mistake," said Gloria Valencia-Cothran, who  deals with social-service issues for County Supervisor John MacDonald.  </P> <P> Valencia-Cothran and other local leaders asked that the consul general join  their efforts to gain more housing money from Washington.  </P> <P> "We need another voice," Valencia-Cothran said. "Congress has already heard  from us. The consul general has access to Washington. He can serve as a  bullhorn to let them know about our problem."  </P></p>

			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / Opponents of Yeltsin accused in anti-corruption probe AN anti-corruption commission made up of supporters of Russian president Boris Yeltsin yesterday accused the vice-president, Mr Alexander Rutskoi, one of Mr Yeltsin's most outspoken critics, of being 'linked' to a Swiss bank account containing millions of dollars smuggled from Russia. The commission also asked parliament to sack another Yeltsin opponent, the chief prosecutor, Mr Valentin Stepankov, Russia's most senior legal official, and to 'review the conduct' of Mr Rutskoi. Mr Rutskoi dismissed the charges and described his accusers as 'a committee of rascals'. The commission, whose chairman is the minister of justice, was set up by Mr Yeltsin. It has no authority to prosecute individuals, but it can make recommendations to the president that he bring cases before either the public prosecutors or parliament. Yesterday's allegations highlight the extent to which widely popular anti-corruption campaigns are being wielded as political weapons in the conflict between Mr Yeltsin and his conservative antagonists. The battle began last April when Mr Rutskoi accused top Yeltsin allies of assisting 'mafia-style groups' in their attempt to 'seize control of the country'. Mr Stepankov continued the offensive by launching corruption probes into the affairs of two cabinet ministers who are strong supporters of the president. Mr Yeltsin's camp struck back yesterday. Mr Andrei Makarov, a member of the anti-corruption commission, said the group had uncovered a network of corruption in the Russian government and law-enforcement agencies. 'We are no longer dealing with individuals but a fully fledged system,' Mr Makarov said. He also accused Mr Stepankov of plotting to murder him and said that he could substantiate his charges with taped telephone conversations. Yesterday's allegations included charges that officials illegally diverted oil which had been earmarked to fulfil Russian state contracts with Bulgaria and India and sold it instead in western Europe, privately pocketing the revenues. Mr Yuri Kalmikov, the Russian minister of justice and chairman of the commission, blamed the prosecutor-general's office for 'complete failure in the struggle against crime' and said he was handing his commission's charges over to the Moscow prosecutor's office instead. Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the chairman of parliament and one of Mr Yeltsin's most bitter opponents, defended Mr Stepankov as the only Russian official seriously battling corruption. In response to widespread fears that many export deals benefit corrupt officials, the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations yesterday severely restricted the number of companies, including joint ventures, allowed to trade in strategic raw materials. Only four companies have retained the right to export oil, five to export petroleum products and five to export coloured metals.</p>

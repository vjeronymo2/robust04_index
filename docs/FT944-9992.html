			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): M&amp;S makes haste slowly - Company in the news Investors in Marks and Spencer expect good steady progress - and that is exactly what the UK's most profitable retailer delivered this week. Perhaps expectations are always a little too high, for the share price once again shed a few pence following the announcement of the interim results on Tuesday. Pre-tax profits for the 26 weeks to October 1 rose 15 per cent to Pounds 354m on the back of a 7 per cent sales increase to Pounds 3.07bn. This was, by any standards, a strong performance in a competitive market where consumers are proving extremely cautious - perhaps taking their cue from the group itself. For caution is a key ingredient in the M&amp;S approach to business, even when its expansion plans are accelerating. Capital spending is being lifted to a record Pounds 400m this year and is likely to be more than Pounds 1bn over three years. Sir Richard Greenbury, the chairman who has been with the group since he was 16, cites the parable of the tortoise and the hare while explaining how M&amp;S is increasing its presence in Europe and the Far East. 'It's a marathon not a sprint,' he insists. The group now has only 25 stores on the continent of Europe, but it is investigating around 50 further sites in France, the Netherlands and Spain. Interim operating profits in Europe were down from Pounds 9.3m to Pounds 5m after charging Pounds 3.8m for the opening of new stores. But sales increased from Pounds 134.5m to Pounds 152.3m, and further gains are expected following the introduction of the Outstanding Value Campaign. The campaign, run in the UK for the past couple of years, passes on to customers cost savings made through improvements in efficiency and information technology without damaging operating margins. Sir Richard said that, since the end of the half, sales had grown by about 20 per cent. There were signs of France and Spain coming out of recession and, if the increase could be maintained, the second half would benefit strongly. In contrast to Europe, the Far East showed a good rise in operating profits from Pounds 5.1m to Pounds 8m, while sales were up from Pounds 23.2m to Pounds 32.1m. The half-dozen M&amp;S stores in Hong Kong are considered to be the most profitable in the group. Meanwhile, a management team is in Japan looking at the possibility of opening stores there - but, again, the watchword is caution. Back home the room for expansion is more limited. While there are not many high streets or out-of-town shopping centres where the group is not already represented, it is continuing to extend its selling space. This year, about 500,000 sq ft is to be added, mostly in town and city centres, to bring the total UK space to 11.1m sq ft. Sir Richard described progress last year as 'substantial'. UK sales improved to Pounds 2.52bn from Pounds 2.37bn, yielding operating profits of Pounds 343m, up from a previous Pounds 297m. The group continued to win market share in clothing, where sales improved by 8.9 per cent to Pounds 1.3bn, and food sales were ahead by 3.9 per cent to Pounds 1.1bn. The black spot was home furnishing, where sales were down by almost 1 per cent. But forecast profits of around Pounds 950m for the full year leave the shares at a premium of 25 per cent to the market. While some criticisms can be levelled at the group - it does not, for example, provide like-for-like sales figures - its track record is impressive, and it is certain to remain a core holding.</p>

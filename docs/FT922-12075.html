			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / International Bonds: Activity set to centre on demand for dollar securities SELECTIVE demand for dollar securities is set to provide some direction for activity in the Eurobond market over the next few weeks. Following the latest easing by the Federal Reserve, the market has so far failed to rally. Borrowers are keeping an eye on the market, however, and a number of companies are likely to tap the dollar sector, if the market picks up as they expect. Although swap opportunities remain unappealing, many borrowers may be prepared to lock in to fixed interest rates at around these levels. A number of Japanese borrowers, including the Export Import Bank of Japan, have been looking at the market, but so far only the Japan Finance Corporation for Municipal Enterprises (JFM) has mandated a bank to arrange a transaction. A Dollars 200m 10-year deal for JFM is expected to emerge later this week via Bank of Tokyo. The deal is expected to be priced to yield about 30 basis points above the 10-year US Treasury. France's Compagnie Bancaire is expected to launch a Dollars 500m five-year deal via J. P. Morgan after a series of roadshows in the next few weeks. Demand for dollar paper is concentrated mainly among retail and small institutional investors in continental Europe, who take a positive view on the dollar. Three deals emerged, in dollars and D-Marks, in the Japanese equity-linked sector, despite a further fall in the Nikkei index, which ended below 17,000. However, the calendar for new issues in the coming weeks is extremely thin. Few deals had been planned, and several have been cancelled due to the dire performance of the Tokyo stock market. The two dollar offerings yesterday, for Nippon Synthetic Chemical Industry and Nippon Koshuha Steel, both performed quite well, bid at 100 1/4 and 100 5/8 respectively, above their par issue price, according to lead manager Yamaichi International.</p>

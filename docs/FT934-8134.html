			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Survey of World Nuclear Industry (6): Reluctant heirs to the Soviet legacy - Russia and Ukraine make the best of their plants despite doubts on safety WIDESPREAD alarm over the safety of Soviet-designed reactors in eastern Europe has not prevented a resumption of expansion plans by post-Soviet Russia and the Ukraine. In the Ukraine a recent parliamentary vote not only facilitated the resumption of construction at three sites, but also permitted continued operation at Chernobyl, site of the 1986 disaster. Ukraine's decision is is understandable. It imports half its primary energy requirements, mostly from Russia. Since it gained its independence, the cost of that energy has escalated because Russia is no longer prepared to sell gas and oil at subsidised prices, given its own desperation for hard currency earnings. Ukraine now owes Rbs600bn for gas, which is used extensively in power generation, with the prospect of paying full world prices from January 1994. Ukraine is therefore forced to increase its dependence on nuclear because it cannot afford to buy alternative sources, such as the plentiful Russian gas. Current generation is dominated by thermal plants (66 per cent) while nuclear accounts for 27 per cent of generation. The Ukraine's decision to continue operating units at Chernobyl aroused particular dismay because the reactors are the RBMK type, considered the most unsafe. However, the parliament also voted to complete the partly built 1,000MW third generation WWER units at the Khmelnitski, Rovno and Zaporozhe plants. The Ukrainians still have to decide what to do with their waste as Russia seems no longer willing to handle it on a long-term basis. The WWER units are generally recognised as being much safer although they have often been tarred with the same brush as the RBMK, mainly because of the state of the Kozloduy plant in Bulgaria. While western technology can greatly improve the safety of the plants concerned, there is little evidence that the Ukrainians or the Russians are looking for new western reactors. This was compounded when an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) panel reported there was no reason for the closure of RBMKs at five sites in Russia and Lithuania, provided earlier IAEA safety recommendations were implemented. Such statements reinforce Russia's decision to press on with its own nuclear programme, placed on hold after Chernobyl, and to rely almost entirely on home grown reactors. Russia intends to increase nuclear's share of generation from 11.8 per cent to 30 per cent by the year 2030. A main motive for the Russians is their need to maximise oil and gas exports for urgently required hard currency earnings. Given the danger that because of Russia's declining oil sector it may change to a net importer of crude from a major exporter, the emphasis on gas exports is growing. As gas is also used extensively for electricity generation, the Russians are likely to prefer growth in nuclear generation rather than gas-fired plant in order to maximise hard currency exports. The Russian programme envisages the completion and operation of three new units at Kalinin, Kursk and Balakovo by 1997 as well as two new units at Balakovo by 2005 and a further 20 reactors by 2010. The programme is based largely on development of various new medium-sized reactor designs. The Russians are also persisting with fast breeder reactors, developing a larger version of the reactors now operating at Beloyarsk and at Shevchenko in Kazakhstan. Although the main expansion programmes in the region are intending to utilise domestic technology, there is still plenty of work for western utilities in enhancing safety and efficiency at existing plant. This is particularly the case as more funds seem to be flowing in the region's direction. One key step was the establishment of the G-7 multilateral fund to improve safety at plants in eastern Europe, which is being administered by the EBRD. The fund is also only designed for the 32 reactors deemed safe enough for upgrading, and excludes the 26 RBMK reactors currently operating in the region, as well as equipment designed to prolong the operating life of a plant. A timetable for closure has to be therefore agreed before a grant is made - a difficult business for a country such as Bulgaria which relies on its sole nuclear plant at Kozloduy for 40 per cent of its electricity. In order to obtain a grant of Ecu24m from the fund the Bulgarians had to agree to close down two of the older units at the plant. Another important breakthrough came in the summer when the EC announced that for the first time teams of western experts were to carry out long-term safety work at six Russian and Ukrainian sites. The agreement was reached because the Russians and Ukrainians offered suitable legal indemnity in the event of accidents. The agreement is expected to add a further Ecu62m to the Ecu20m the EC has spent on nuclear safety in Russia and Ukraine so far under the TACIS programme. Companies across the Community, including EdF, Scottish Nuclear, Tractebel, Nuclear Electric and RWE have obtained contracts under the programme. Elsewhere in the region, Western operators have had some joy in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Both countries currently operate one nuclear plant each but, after much indecision, the Czechs announced in March that they would complete two units on the country's second plant at Temelin. Westinghouse was employed as the principal contractor for safety and control equipment. The decision comes in spite of a significant decline in demand for power in recent years and assumes, despite evidence to the contrary, that demand will grow by 2 per cent a year from 1995. Westinghouse hopes that its modernisation of the WWER 1,000MW reactors at Temelin will give it prime position when other countries embark on similar schemes. Meanwhile, the Czech Republic's former partner Slovakia has embarked upon an even more controversial course. The Slovaks estimate that it will cost Dollars 780m to complete two units at the partially constructed Mochovce plant and have held negotiations with western companies over the formation of a joint venture to complete the plant which is being lined up for privatisation. Extensive talks have been held with Bayernwerk and EdF and the EBRD is said to have been approached over funding. John Leslie is Editor of FT East European Energy Report</p>

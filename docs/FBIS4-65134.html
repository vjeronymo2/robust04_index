			<p>BFN     [Text] Returning tonight from his visit to Barbados,  Canada, and Strasbourg, Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis  said the Greek Cypriot side expects the UN secretary general to  circulate his report on the Cyprus issue, which will tell the  truth about what has happened and the positions of the two sides  in the upcoming talks on the confidence-building measures.    Mikhailidhis said any further delay in the circulation of  the  report endangers the credibility of the procedure. He noted  that our side has no objection if others want to continue  persuading the Turkish side to accept the UN document of 21  March. The foreign minister added: Our side, however, objects  to interventions in the circulation of the report and actions  that will question the image and the credibility of the  procedure. The confidence-building measures issue acted as a  catalyst to show foreigners that Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot  side have no political will for any solution.    Mikhailidhis stressed that Cyprus' closeness to Europe will  continue despite threats by Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas,  who is obviously concerned that Cyprus' course toward Europe  will proceed.    The foreign minister said that by abandoning the  confidence-building measures to discuss the substance of the  Cyprus issue, we are essentially opening the door for Denktas to  escape from the difficult position he is in. He added that if  the UN secretary general's efforts fail, we will ask the  Security Council to adopt alternative ways to implement the  resolutions on Cyprus.</p>

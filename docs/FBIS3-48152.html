North Korean and senior Australian officials have held  secret  talks at Australian Embassies in Jakarta and Bangkok, and the  federal government has informed the United States, Japan and  South Korea.    "But those talks have really essentially been about whether  we should talk," Bilney said.    No decisions have been made about formal dialogue, which  would be contingent upon three conditions, the Department of  Foreign Affairs said in a statement.    Satisfactory progress must be made in the implementation of  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] safeguards and  Australia "strongly supports" the U.S. negotiating stance on the  nuclear issue, the statement said.    Australia would never play a "solo role" in putting  relations  with Korea at a normal footing and so progress would also be  necessary in North Korea's relations with South Korea and the  United States, it said.    Australia would also respect a call from North Korea's three  adversaries not to reestablish ties.    Restoring ties relies strongly on whether North Korea will  comply with U.S. pressure to allow international inspectors into  its nuclear facilities.    Australia reportedly wants North Korea to rejoin the world  community's economic and political affairs and would therefore  be sympathetic to Pyongyang's reported proposal.    "North Korea...is an isolated country, and one can only  speculate that perhaps it's feeling that isolation more now,"  Bilney said.    The Australian Government has considered inviting a senior  North Korean Government official to visit Australia later in the  year to initiate a stronger dialogue between the two countries.    While the step was entirely unsolicited, there were a number  of possible reasons why Australia was approached, including the  close relations with North Korea's main adversaries, the U.S.,  Japan and South Korea, the statement said.    Other reasons could include the fact that Australia  currently  chairs the IAEA Board of Governors and maintains a strong  non-proliferation stance on nuclear weapons, the department  said, adding that there have been sporadic contacts between  Australia and North Korea in recent years.    Relations between Australia and North Korea were severed in  1975 when the militant Communist government reacted to  Australia's backing of South Korea in the United Nations by  abandoning its embassy in Canberra and expelling Australian  diplomats from Pyongyang.</p>

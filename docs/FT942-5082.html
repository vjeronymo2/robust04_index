			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Tupolev crash adds to China's air woes China's reputation for air safety was yesterday dealt another severe blow when a Russian-built Tupolev-154 crashed eight minutes after take-off from the city of Xian, killing all 160 passengers on board. The crash of the Russian TU-154 of China Northwest Airlines, bound for the southern city of Guangzhou, continues a run of accidents, hijackings and near-misses for China's overstretched aviation sector. Its airline industry has undergone explosive growth in the past few years, which has strained overstretched pilot and maintenance resources. The country now has over 30 regional airlines; passenger growth has been running at 20 per cent annually. In 1993, 76 people died in five crashes. This followed the deaths of 276 the previous year, including those in the November 1992 crash of a Boeing 737 near Guilin, a southern beauty spot, in which 141 perished. A foreign airline representative said visitors to China were entitled to 'shudder' if they found themselves booked on Russian-built aircraft widely used on domestic routes. Some 10-15 per cent of China's airliners are Russian-supplied, including Ilyushins, Antonovs and TU-154s. A Chinese company announced at the weekend it had leased a further five Tupolevs. A Chinese newspaper reported yesterday that mechanical and personnel problems had increased in China's aviation sector this year. The China Business Times quoted an official of the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), the country's aviation regulatory agency, as attributing problems to 'lack of safety consciousness and poor management'. In the first five months of this year 17 accidents had occurred, involving aircraft missing the tarmac on landing, mid-air engine failure and wing tips touching the ground on landing, the official said. Among factors behind China's disastrous safety record was the 'poor quality' of pilots and ground crew, and ill-discipline among staff. In February the International Airline Passengers' Association described China as an aviation danger spot. The authorities have launched air safety drives with, it seems, little effect. Safety procedures at airports are lax by international standards; so too is cabin discipline. China air row, Page 6</p>

			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Oil bid alert The Enterprise/Lasmo bid battle flared up again with the latter the market's heaviest traded stock and the former the FT-SE 100's best individual performer as the takeover saga moved into its closing two weeks. Lasmo shares underperformed a generally strong oil sector early in the session, still weighed down by worries that the Enterprise takeover bid will fail. However, late in the session the stock price perked up, eventually closing a net 8 higher at 149p after very heavy trade of 15m shares. Enterprise, meanwhile, were always on the uptick, and raced ahead to 416p before closing a net 16 1/2 higher at 414 1/2 p with a good 3.5m shares changing hands. Close observers of the takeover struggle said that the outcome was much closer than the market was indicating. Others, however, said that with Lasmo shares still at a discount to the bid terms - worth around 170p a share - the odds favoured a Lasmo escape. It was also pointed out that the recent strong performance of the oil price was making Lasmo's assumptions in its defence document look increasingly conservative.</p>

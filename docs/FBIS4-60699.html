			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Khartoum, 26 May (SUNA) -- The Foreign Ministry  today issued a statement on allegations made by official media  organs and the Government of Egypt concerning the directives  issued by the authorities of the state of Khartoum on planning  and reorganizing the national capital.    It said that these directives affect 16 places, including  three properties belonging to the Egyptian Army which should  have been returned to the Sudanese Government after the  departure of the British-Egyptian occupying force at Sudan's  independence in 1956. The other 13 areas were leased to the  (?Irrigation Department) and to an Arab-Egyptian company which  the government assigned for Egyptian and other resident  communities in 1958.    The Ministry added in its statement that these places were  unoccupied for a long period and claims that some families were  evicted on the eve of the festival 'Id al-Adha are pure and  unfounded distortions indulged in by newspapers. The ministry  stressed that these directives were routine and also affected  citizens, as well as Sudanese and foreign institutions. [passage  omitted]</p>

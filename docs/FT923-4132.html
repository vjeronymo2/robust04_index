			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Romanians chase paper profits from privatisation: Efforts to bury suspicion of capitalism THE pedlars in Bucharest's University Square have a new ware to hawk this summer: privatisation vouchers. Trade is brisk. Since June 1, when the National Privatisation Agency (NPA) opened registration, more than 8.4m vouchers have been issued to the public. The public is to receive vouchers for 30 per cent of all shares in 6,200 state-run enterprises up for privatisation. 'It doesn't matter that people are trading their vouchers straightaway. The important thing is that for the first time in 40 years Romanians have a financial asset they can dispose of freely and which cannot be retracted,' says Mr Teodor Nicolaescu, the NPA'S director general. Mr Nicolaescu says the past 12 months have produced noticeable results. For instance, more than 5,000 small businesses, restaurants, shops and factories, have been sold to the public. About 5,500 small and medium-sized companies have been allocated to five Private Ownership Funds into which domestic and foreign investors can buy and sell. A State Ownership Fund has been set up to manage and hold the equity of the commercial companies. A pilot scheme was launched last month in an attempt to attract greater public support for the privatisation process. This involved selling Vranco, a clothes manufacturer, and Ursus, a brewery. 'We needed a success to increase public confidence,' said Mr Doru Tiberiu, the NPA's general manager. 'Many politicians and sections of the media have misrepresented what we have been doing. They are feeding fears that mass privatisation equals mass unemployment and that the country is being sold out to foreigners,' he added. The pilot scheme involved splitting Vranco's equity. Incom SpA, an Italian company, bought 51 per cent of the equity, while the remainder was divided between the company's 3,800 employees. In addition, Incom guaranteed jobs for two years, and undertook to invest Dollars 5m over five years. Ursus, was privatised differently. The majority of its shares was sold via a public offer, while the remaining 49 per cent is expected to be sold to one or more strategic investors. The NPA hopes that the methods used to privatise the two companies will serve as a blueprint for future sales. Yet, despite these successes, the NPA admits the scheme, which involves 30 companies, is progressing slowly. Roland Berger, the German management consultants who are assisting Romania's privatisation through the the European Community's Phare programme, attribute the delays in part to Romania's unpopularity with foreign investors. 'It remains difficult to convince western companies to look at Romania when they have other opportunities closer to home, and when the country's image in the media has been one of political and social instability,' says Mr Michael Nagel of Roland Berger. The consultants helped privatise Vranco and hope to complete negotiations for Pantera, a shoe manufacturer, later this month. Significantly, companies specialising in textiles, leather and furniture making, considered amongst Romania's most promising industries, have attracted interest from German and Italian companies. This lingering, and inherent public suspicion of foreigners is being eagerly tapped by the country's political parties, which are in the middle of parliamentary and presidential election campaigns. The outcome of the elections could well determine the extent of any future foreign investment in Romania. Political parties in the campaign are debating the pace and depth of reform during the country's transition to a market economy. Indeed, Mr Adrian Severin, head of the NPA, says the entire economic  - and political  - reform programme could become unhinged, as nationalist opposition parties regroup. These parties, such as the Vatra Romaneasca, are xenophobic and critical of any foreign involvement in the country. Some of the opposition to reforms also comes from the National Salvation Front, which was catapulted into power following the overthrow of the Ceausescu regime in December 1989. The irony is that one of its leading members is Mr Severin.</p>

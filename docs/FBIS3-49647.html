When expounding yesterday on  some decisions by the Maribor Public Prosecutor's Office  regarding the finding of arms at the Maribor airport, Dusan  Pozar, senior prosecutor in the Maribor Public Prosecutor's  Office, pointed out that the basic prosecutor's office worked  according to law. Proof was insufficient to prove unauthorized  dealing in arms, or to prove smuggling. According to the  prosecutor, there is still the suspicion that the Defense  Ministry has recognized Hasan Cengic as the authorized envoy of  the former Bosnia-Herzegovina and traded in arms with him. This  happened in spring 1992 when it sold him 5,560 automatic rifles  in violation of the UN Security Council Resolution on the  embargo on arms sale to the territory of the former Yugoslavia.  According to the prosecutor, Janez Jansa, as the only competent  person, has violated the Security Council Resolution several  times. Therefore, the Maribor Public Prosecutor's Office has  presented the matter to the Ljubljana Public Prosecutor's Office.</p>

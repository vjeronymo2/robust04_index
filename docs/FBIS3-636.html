The chairman of the Task Force Relief Committee, Group Captain  George Ayitey, who was briefing newsmen in Tamale today, did not  disclose the amount. He, however, explained that the task force  cannot do much with the donations from the nongovernmental  source, hence, the government's intervention. The task force  has, so far, registered 132,000 displaced persons in the region,  the bulk of them, over 60,000 in Bimbila. These figures do not  include Konkombas, because the task force has not been able to  reach them in the bush. Group Captain Ayitey said the security  agencies had been concentrating on the restoration of public  confidence which has not been easy, especially because of two  shooting incidents on the Tamale-Salaga road last week.  [passage omitted]    Meanwhile, reports reaching Tamale indicate that fighting is  raging at Sakpe in the Yendi District and that the village has  been burned down. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> January 2, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> MEDICAL TRAINING CURBS  </P> <P> In an effort to allay public fear that medical residents are working too many  hours and providing inadequate patient care in hospitals, an ad hoc committee  organized by the University of California has recommended that the state's five  public and three private medical schools restrict doctors in training to no  more than 84 hours of work per week. The recommendations are in stark contrast  to current practices of allowing young physicians, particularly obstetricians  and surgeons, to work round the clock without sleep for upwards of 90 or 100  hours a week.  </P> <P> The California plan for reform, however, is in keeping with those of a number  of other efforts around the country to make medical residency training less  stressful and to improve hospital care of patients.  </P> <P> The problem for California, and one the UC committee did not address, is how to  pay for the additional personnel that would be needed to implement such a plan.  According to the committee's own estimates, to replace residents with  additional residents, nurses, or trained physicians could cost anywhere from  $26 million to $190 million a year.  </P></p>

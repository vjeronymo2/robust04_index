			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian border guards are preparing to repel a cross  border attack in Tajikistan. Officials in the Russian border  guard headquarters told INTERFAX that Tajik opposition fighters  and Afghan Mojahedin were expected to attack the 12th post of  the Moskovskiy unit towards the end of April.    The border guard chief of staff Lieutenant General Aleksandr  Tymko did not rule out the possibility that other posts of the  unit would be attacked. He thought that the objective of the  provocations was to wreck the peace process.    He also emphasized that the Russian border guards were  capable of repelling any attack on the Tajik-Afghan border.</p>

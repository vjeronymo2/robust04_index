Testifying at the National Assembly session, Yi said his  government would submit a market opening schedule to the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) after taking into account  the contents of similar schedules to be submitted by major  countries like the United States, Japan and the European Union  (EU). He thus implied that South Korea may revise its original  market opening plan depending on the outcome of the on-going  U.S.-Japan trade talks.    The premier said that so far most other countries are  withholding their market opening schedules. "This is due to  their policy to cope with the outcome of the U.S.-Japan trade  talks," Yi said.    Also speaking at the assembly floor, Agriculture, Forestry  and Fisheries Minister Kim Yang-pae said that last year, South  Korea recorded a deficit of about 5,040 million dollars in the  trade of agricultural and fishery products. He said exports  amounted to some 2,750 million dollars and imports to 7,790  million dollars.    "We plan to boost farm and fishery goods exports by  promoting, for instance, the shipment of large amounts of hog  meat and Kimchi to the vast Japanese market," Kim said.</p>

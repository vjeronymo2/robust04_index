			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Government Bonds: Strong tap issue demand lifts long-dated gilts LONG-DATED UK government bonds gained more than half a point, helped by strong demand for the latest 15-year tap issue. The Bank of England has sold a total of between Pounds 700m and Pounds 750m of its Pounds 1bn tap issue, the 8 1/2 per cent gilt due 2007, according to traders. About half of the tap issue was sold yesterday. Traders said demand for long-dated issues was strong. The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 rose to 115 23/32 yielding 9.42 per cent, after opening at 115 1/16 . Short-dated gilts remained firm in spite of sterling's decline against the D-Mark yesterday. US Treasury prices firmed across the board yesterday as demand in the underlying cash market picked up in the wake of a rally in the futures market. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  7/16 at 107 7/32 , yielding 7.391 per cent. The two-year note was also higher, up  3/16 at 100 5/8 , yielding 4.648 per cent. There was particularly heavy buying from retail investors, said dealers, and securities at both the short and long end of the market were well bid, supported by hopes that the Federal Reserve might ease monetary policy one more time. If the Fed does cut interest rates again, it could well come after Friday's jobs figure. The market is expecting non-farm payrolls last month to have fallen by between 50,000 and 100,000. If payrolls prove to have declined by substantially more than that, an easing of policy could be triggered, say some analysts. THE strong yen and lower interest rates helped Japanese government bond prices to reach new highs in moderate trading yesterday. The yield on the benchmark No 129 opened at 5.31 per cent and closed at 5.28 per cent in Tokyo. Prices gained further in the London trading session, with the benchmark yielding 5.275 per cent. Short-term money market rates fell again on yesterday, with the three-month certificates of deposit rate slipping to 5.27 per cent from 5.4 per cent on Monday. The Bank of Japan lowered the official discount rate from 5 to 4.5 per cent at late last month, and money market rates have slipped on subsequent trading days. GERMAN government bonds closed little changed on the day as investors took profits, wiping out early gains. The Liffe bund futures contract reached a high of 88.02, breaking through the 88.01 technical resistance level, but then fell back to close at 87.85. Traders said a combination of industrial production figures and worries about inflation prompted some profit-taking. The November industrial production figures for western Germany released yesterday were stronger than expected. Industrial output rose a seasonally and price-adjusted 1.2 per cent in November from October and was up 2.4 per cent on a year ago. Traders said the figures prompted some nervousness that the German economy might not be slowing down as much as previously expected. Elsewhere in Europe, the Dutch bond market witnessed another strong session helped by strong demand from foreigners. The 8 3/4 per cent Dutch bond due January 2007 closed at 103.15, compared with Monday's close of 102.68. Prices closed below the highs of the day, however, as some investors started switching out of the Dutch market ahead of Friday's Consumer Price Index announcement and on rumours that the Dutch agency may announce a further issue.</p>

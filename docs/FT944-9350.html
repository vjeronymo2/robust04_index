			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Management: Cherry-picking top talent - Reuters Holdings has taken the 'virtual' office concept beyond its usual boundaries, finds Desmond Dearlove Just a few yards off Fleet Street on the first floor of the London headquarters of Reuters Holdings, one of the most far-reaching examples of 'virtual business practice' is unfolding. It represents a break with traditional business structures and pushes at the frontiers of current management thinking - it could radically redefine the nature of organisations. In the UK, the concept of the 'virtual organisation' has been largely technology-driven, with a number of companies using networked computer terminals to create an IT infrastructure - or 'virtual office' - which exists independently of the physical location of employees. IBM, Mercury Communications and Digital Equipment, for example, have all experimented with this sort of model, using electronic-mail and other IT tools to enable employees working remotely to plug into virtual offices. However, commentators in the US claim that the virtual concept can be taken further. Tom Peters, in particular, argues that an important strength of software companies in California's Silicon Valley lies in a complex web of relationships that promotes multiple collaborations. This, he says, results in amorphous business groupings that can reconfigure to create new virtual organisations without the pain and expense of restructuring or redundancies. It is this model that inspired Greg Garrison, director of the Reuters usability group, to create what is probably one of the first truly virtual organisations in Europe; one which spans two continents and incorporates people from 12 other companies - including Microsoft, Logica and Admiral Computing. Garrison's achievement has brought a ringing endorsement from Peters who described him in the September issue of his newsletter On Achieving Excellence as 'an impresario, creating a new way of doing business as he goes'. In early 1993, Garrison was drafted into the Reuters London headquarters from its Asia Pacific office to set up the usability group. His brief was to achieve a breakthrough in the user-friendliness of the financial information services provided by Reuters to international bankers, brokers and dealers in 150 countries. The aim was to seize competitive advantage through the creation of highly intuitive user interfaces which accurately matched the delivery of information with the way customers in dealing room environments wanted to work. With keen competition from other suppliers, including Bloombergs Financial Services and Dow Jones Telerate, Reuters' leadership of the highly lucrative market for real-time information was at stake. Garrison's start-up plan for the usability operation called for a staff of 24 full-time Reuters employees specialising in human-computer interface design. But a combination of hiring controls and the company's reluctance to employ permanent specialists with the esoteric skills required meant Garrison was allowed only two of the 24 staff requested. Board level commitment to the initiative, however, ensured a generous budget to fund the staffing requirements from outside. Garrison's dilemma was how to assemble the team of highly specialised IT experts. The traditional method was to outsource. But an initial evaluation of the sorts of skills required - ergonomics, software prototyping, interface graphic design and artificial intelligence - convinced him that no single consultancy in the UK could provide all the solutions. In response he invented a 'virtual' organisation, cherry-picking the top talent from 12 companies around the world. 'I needed an organisation which would be a constantly evolving and changing team of experts - some of whom would be from other companies, some of whom would be independent - but most of whom would not be permanent Reuters staff,' Garrison explains. 'I wanted to employ them very flexibly on a project-by-project basis when and as I needed them.' Using the promise of substantial contracts as a carrot, Garrison was able to convince the consultancies to take the unusual step of signing non-disclosure contracts, not just with Reuters but with each other. This laid the foundation for a collaborative environment. What he now has at his disposal is an extended virtual team of 50 people, consisting of a core group of between 12 and 24 who work on-site at the Reuters' office in London. Some individuals contribute from other UK locations, and consultants based in the US and Europe participate in the team remotely using E-mail, fax and telephone. Garrison operates his virtual organisation as a 'just-in-time' skills pool, which shrinks and grows - and can even change its skills composition - to match the workload. When not required, participating consultants return to their own companies. Such an arrangement does not come cheap, however. Team members are charged to Reuters on a day rate, typically between Pounds 300 and Pounds 500 per person. But Garrison calculates that savings on recruitment costs and staff benefits including holidays, sick leave and pensions mean that he pays a premium of only 8 per cent to 15 per cent above the market rate for his virtual employees. He believes that the calibre of the staff alone justifies the premium. It also enables him to start and stop projects almost instantaneously. Along with the expertise they bring, each of the 50 or so consultants also brings access to the skills pool of the organisation. In one case, by accessing the Microsoft product research laboratories in the US, team members from Microsoft were able to provide a software tool that Reuters needed but which wasn't available in the marketplace. Reuters has just installed state-of-the-art usability testing laboratories to enable Garrison to continue the virtual experiment. This suggests that so far at least the virtual concept is delivering tangible results.</p>

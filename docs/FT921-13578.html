			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Seismic rumblings along global party-lines  -The industry-wide effects of an AT&amp;T/Cable and Wireless alliance A GLOBAL alliance between American Telephone &amp; Telegraph and Cable and Wireless - which has been the subject of intense negotiations since last September - would create an earthquake in the international telecommunications industry. AT&amp;T is the most formidable player in the industry, although largely based in the US. C and W is much smaller but has the best global spread of any telephone company, with operations in the UK, Hong Kong, Japan, the US, Australia and countless developing countries. Wide-ranging collaboration between the two groups would almost certainly cause a knock-on effect in the rest of the industry as other telephone companies scramble to form their own alliances. The sector is already in a frenzy of matchmaking as national monopolies try to turn themselves into internationally competitive operators. But will an alliance be concluded? The negotiators failed to make progress in talks earlier this month, denting hopes of a quick deal. The two companies seem to have reached agreement in principle on AT&amp;T buying a quarter to a third of Mercury Communications, C and W's UK subsidiary. But they were unable to agree on how wider co-operation would work and AT&amp;T also has doubts about moving ahead on Mercury before the British general election later this year. The main attraction of an alliance from C and W's perspective is that AT&amp;T would give it the necessary muscle to compete more effectively with British Telecommunications in the UK. Lord Young, C and W's chairman, has made it clear that he does not want to compete head on with large groups like AT&amp;T and BT. He prefers a 'super-niche' strategy of providing mobile, data and international services in high-margin markets around the world. AT&amp;T would be expected to pay about Pounds 1bn for a minority share of Mercury as well as committing itself to investing further cash to help build Mercury up as a competitor to BT. Effectively, Lord Young would be getting two giants to compete against each other, rather than competing directly against either himself. Such thinking was also behind C and W's decision not to proceed with its planned Dollars 174m (Pounds 97m) acquisition of TRT/FTC last November, which would have made it the fourth largest long-distance operator in the US, but pitted it directly against AT&amp;T. Lord Young seems also to want AT&amp;T's collaboration in continental Europe. He has already called on the European Commission to take decisive action later this year to open up the telecommunications market to competition. For C and W, the main problems in concluding a deal are to get the maximum price and to ensure that it does not get squashed by AT&amp;T, which has been described as 'an 800lb gorilla'. C and W is protected from a hostile takeover bid by the UK government's 'golden share', which prevents any single shareholder owning more than 15 per cent of its stock. On the other hand, the company appears to want to do a deal on more than just Mercury for fear that AT&amp;T would otherwise team up with different partners in other European countries, turning Mercury into the UK appendage of a global empire. For AT&amp;T, a deal with C and W would take it closer to chairman Mr Bob Allen's goal of earning half the group's revenue from outside the US by the time he retires in 2000. The main attraction of taking a stake in Mercury would be that AT&amp;T would then be operating a network on both sides of the Atlantic. Instead of handing over most of its UK phone calls to BT in the mid-Atlantic, as at present, it would hope to channel most of them through Mercury. International calls have been a pot of gold for telephone companies in recent years as a result of cartel practices which have kept prices artificially high. The UK-US route is the most lucrative anywhere in the world, earning both BT and AT&amp;T well over Pounds 100m in annual profits, and the US group may well ask why it should not try to grab a larger share for itself. Some AT&amp;T executives are concerned about disturbing the traditional profitable correspondent relationship with BT. Others, though, argue that BT has already declared war by buying a 20 per cent share of McCaw, the largest US mobile communications operator, and setting up Syncordia, a US subsidiary which is designed to poach some of AT&amp;T's largest business customers. The old correspondent relationships, which have characterised the industry for decades, are breaking down anyway. Technological advances are driving down costs while liberalisation is allowing new breeds of competitor to chip away at the market. Earlier this month Sprint, the third largest US long-distance operator, said it planned to establish a UK network to compete with BT and Mercury. If AT&amp;T teamed up with Mercury, BT might feel it had no option but to do a deal with MCI, the second largest US long-distance operator. But AT&amp;T may have doubts about joining forces with C and W throughout the European Community. C and W's operations on the Continent are still embryonic and the US company may therefore feel it could do better on its own. AT&amp;T is also clearly concerned that a Labour government might change UK telecommunications policy. Some observers,though, believe the most likely change would be to block any new competition - so strengthening Mercury's position. AT&amp;T has looked seriously at making a sizeable investment in the UK several times - acquiring a stake in Mercury in the early 1980s, buying part of STC and taking over the manufacturer GPT as part of the Metsun consortium which considered bidding for GEC in 1989. Each time, though, it pulled out and its only significant UK acquisition to date has been Istel, which provides enhanced telecommunications services, for Pounds 180m in 1989. Recently AT&amp;T has been more aggressive. Last year it acquired NCR, the US computer manufacturer, after a bitter takeover bid. Only last week it formed a joint venture to build and run a telephone network in the Ukraine. Strategic decisions within AT&amp;T usually follow a fight between hawks and doves. Whether to link up with C and W or not will be largely determined by which group of AT&amp;T executives has the upper hand.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TRYING TO MAKE A CONNECTION  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                              AT&amp;T         CABLE &amp; WIRELESS                         Year end Dec '90   Year end Jun '91  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Employees                   325,000           39,500 Pre-tax profits         Dollars 4.23bn     Dollars 1.08bn Turnover                Dollars 55.98bn    Dollars 4.59bn Millions of minutes           5,780            1,291 of international out-going telephone traffic in 1990  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

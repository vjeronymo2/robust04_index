			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Fotis Kafarakis from Corfu--recorded statements </F> in English with Greek subtitles]    [Text] The first foreign delegations began arriving at  Ioannis Kapodhistrias Airport in Corfu around 1800 today. More  than 800 people were expected to arrive in Corfu today. These  were the heads of the European socialist parties and their  delegations that will participate in the European Socialist  Party conference. More than 2,500 people are expected to arrive  in the next few days. These are the delegations of the twelve  European Union [EU] members, the four new members, Russia, and  Cyprus.    [Begin recording] [Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring] I  hope  there will be lots of agreements in Corfu. Also, I would like  to congratulate the Greek presidency on the work it has done in  the past six months. We have the signing of the agreements with  the EFTA [European Free Trade Association] countries tomorrow,  which is a major progress for the European Union. We also have  the signing of the cooperation agreement with the Russian  Federation, which is in everybody's interest in Europe. We  obviously have the question of the succession of Jacques Delors.  This matter will be discussed. I would hope we can make  progress, but we will obviously know tomorrow afternoon or  evening.    [Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky] It is true that we  ended up with a very good result at the Austrian referendum for  a country joining the European Union. I think the explanation  for the very good result was that the Austrian Federal  Government and the so-called partners and the universities and  many many others joined forces in showing to the Austrian people  that joining the European Union is more or less a logical step  for Austria, because it has been linked and integrated with the  Twelve for so many years or even decades that it means more or  less formalizing a logical step. Well, from my point of view,  the Greek presidency actually deserves the respect of a country  that negotiated its entry into the European Union taking into  account that we finalized our negotiations under the Greek  presidency and we finalized our negotiations especially from the  point of view that we came through with our own interest,  without being in conflict or controversy with the European Union  and its members. So, the Greek Presidency served as a very  important and efficient catalyst for our own negotiations. [end  recording]</p>

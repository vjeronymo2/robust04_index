			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Britain and China in military land deal Britain and China agreed yesterday on a military land deal in one of the most comprehensive bilateral agreements signed since the 1984 accord under which Hong Kong reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. The agreement was reached just hours after the Legislative Council (LegCo) approved democratic reforms proposed by Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong governor, despite intensive lobbying against the proposals by China. Mr Patten described the accord with China as an honourable agreement. 'It is a good and fair bargain over what has been a difficult issue for both sides,' he told the Financial Times. The lands deal commits the Hong Kong government to spending HKDollars 4bn (Pounds 335m) on building military facilities, including a new base for the Chinese navy. In return, Hong Kong will receive former military sites worth HKDollars 65bn in redevelopment rights. The agreement commits the People's Liberation Army to surrendering to the post-1997 Hong Kong administration all land surplus to its requirements. The PLA has also undertaken to use the land only for military purposes, and to make its personnel stationed in Hong Kong subject to Hong Kong law. Coming so close after the LegCo vote, yesterday's agreement was the clearest sign to date that China is prepared to put its row with Britain to one side and get on with the practical business of the handover. In Beijing, Mr Shen Guofang, the foreign ministry spokesman, described the military bases accord as 'an important achievement'. His remarks were seen as an indication that China was anxious to separate political issues from the practical consid-erations of ensuring a smooth transfer of power. The governor said he was hopeful that with this agreement the two sides could accelerate co-operation. 'We have no option but to step up the pace of co-operation,' he said in an interview. 'The transfer of sovereignty is only three years away.' Mr Hugh Davies, Britain's senior representative to the Joint Liaison Group, the body charged with negotiating the details of the transfer, said he believed that if past differences could be put to one side there was no reason why the JLG could not enter into a more productive and useful phase. However, another British official doubted if the work required could be completed by 1997. He said: 'If everything goes very well, then we could complete three quarters of it, but not all.' In general, however, British officials were upbeat about the defence lands deal. One said: 'The Chinese have come to terms with what has happened on the political front. It won't be easy for us, but we have a basis for talking to them.' Nevertheless, Mr Shen reiterated in Beijing that China would not accept this week's electoral reforms, approved by Hong Kong's Legislative Council, which he insisted ran counter to prior agreements on the handover. He said differences over Hong Kong would continue to bedevil Sino-British relations. Let's try to keep things moving': Chris Patten interview, Page 6 Observer, Page 19</p>

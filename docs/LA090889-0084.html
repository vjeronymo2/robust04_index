			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. OFFERS TO MEDIATE FOR S. AFRICA, BLACKS  </P> <P> The Bush Administration congratulated South Africa's ruling party for its  election victory and offered Thursday to serve as mediator between the  government and the black majority.  </P> <P> "We are committed to working with all parties to bring the South African  government and black South Africans together in a substantial effort to end  apartheid," State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said. "We therefore  are prepared to work with the new government toward this end."  </P> <P> White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush sent a personal telegram  of congratulations to acting President Frederik W. de Klerk, although Fitzwater  insisted that such messages are "relatively routine," even in elections that  Washington considers to be less than democratic.  </P> <P> Tutwiler declined to say if the United States is ready to lift its economic  sanctions against South Africa.  </P> <P> In a formal statement reacting to the ruling National Party's narrow victory in  Wednesday's election, the Administration underlined its objections to the  apartheid system of racial segregation. But the statement also echoed Bush's  congratulations to the ruling party for winning an election that the U.S.  government had earlier decried as unfair and unrepresentative because blacks  were denied a right to vote.  </P> <P> "We congratulate acting President De Klerk on his party's victory at the polls  and for leading his party to win its mandate for real change in South Africa,"  Tutwiler said.  </P> <P> Reminded that Washington has seldom used such warm language in reference to  South Africa's tightly segregated political system, Tutwiler replied: "You keep  focusing on congratulations. The message is a two-page message. There's more  than just congratulations."  </P> <P> Fitzwater added that U.S. policy toward South Africa is essentially unchanged.  </P> <P> "I would not characterize these telegrams as any different from those sent to  other heads of state in the same situation," he said. However, Fitzwater agreed  with a questioner who noted that no similar telegram was sent to Iranian  President Hashemi Rafsanjani after his recent electoral victory.  </P> <P> Tutwiler emphasized that the Administration's offer of cooperation is  conditioned on the De Klerk government's taking prompt action to bring the  country's black majority into the political system.  </P></p>

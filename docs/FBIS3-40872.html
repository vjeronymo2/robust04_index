			<p>Language: <F P=105> Indonesian </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] In a short time a highly respected institution--in  fact some considered it unapproachable--will be history. It is  the Strategic Intelligence Agency (BAIS) of ABRI [Republic of  Indonesia Armed Forces], which was recently scheduled to change  form. It will be renamed the ABRI Intelligence Agency (BIA). It  will have a slimmer organization and fewer personnel than BAIS.  "In accordance with the needs of the time, a large BAIS is no  longer needed at the present time," said a high-ranking official  commenting on the plans for change.    More important, this intelligence agency will have a lower  line of command. According to TEMPO's source, BIA will no longer  be directly under the commanding general of ABRI's line of  command, as is BAIS, which is presently headed by the commanding  general of ABRI. The head of BIA, according to that source, will  ex officio be the assistant for intelligence to the chief of the  General Staff (ASINTEL KASUM) of ABRI. However, according to  other high-ranking officers, it is still possible that BIA will  be an independent agency under the supervision of ABRI's KASUM  [chief of the General Staff], a position now held by Lieutenant  General H.L. Mantiri. In that case, BIA will not be a separate  agency with easy access to everything.    It is said that Gen. Feisal Tanjung, commanding general of  ABRI, recently reported to the president that BAIS will be  changed into BIA. However, the commanding general of ABRI could  not make an official announcement of the change because some  details still have to be looked into. "So, this might not be  announced until next week (meaning this week)," Brigadier  General Syarwan Hamid, head of ABRI's Information Center, told  TEMPO last Wednesday [19 January] in Jakarta.    This plan has been in preparation for a long time, since  Feisal Tanjung became commanding general of ABRI after the MPR's  [Parliament] general session in March 1993. ABRI Headquarters  formed a team to work on the change. In fact, according to a  former high-ranking officer of BAIS, this has been under  discussion for some years. Changing the structure of BAIS is to  make it more efficient. "But changing the organizational  structure and decreasing the number of personnel doesn't mean  that the organization will be any less important," he continued.    These changes appear to be consistent with the times, which  no longer require that the security apparatus, especially those  active in the field of military intelligence, act with a "tight  fit." Nowadays, he went on to say, given the issues of  democratization and human rights, whether we want to or not, the  security apparatus is being asked to act with more of a "loose  fit." He meant that we only hope that the BIA will limit its  role to suggesting actions which will prevent political, social,  and economic destabilization.    It was different, that retired high-ranking officer  continued, in the era of "tight fit," which allowed BAIS to  carry out direct actions against those considered "enemies of  the state"; for example, imprisonment without due process.    The day-to-day operations of the old intelligence agency  (BAIS), an organization under the direct control of the  commanding general of ABRI, were led by the deputy chairman, an  office now held by Major General Arie Sudewo. This agency has  eight directorates, each led by a director with the rank of one  star, i.e., brigadier general. This does not include the task  units (SATGAS), which handle special areas.    This agency has really become a filter for every activity  here; for example it screens candidates to the DPR/MPR  [Parliament/People's Consultative Assembly], candidates to  high-ranking government posts, diplomats who are going to be  assigned overseas and even BUMN [state-owned company] officials.  One important part of BAIS is Directorate A. They say that this  directorate has a wide scope of operations because it covers  domestic political, social, economic and cultural problems. Its  present director is Brigadier General Agum Gumelar. It is this  directorate which is well known as having the largest number of  aides (PABAN); it has six of them. It is not surprising that  members of this directorate have been present at various  domestic political incidents. For example, Brig. Gen. Agum  played a role in "bringing order to" PDI's [Indonesian Democracy  Party] National Congress in Jakarta in December 1993, at which  Megawati Soekarnoputri was elected general chairman.    BAIS operations also seem to have played a big role in  Indonesian political history, such as dealing with opposition  groups in East Timor and with those referred to as "disturbers  of the peace" in Aceh. This military intelligence agency has  played such an important role that it is not surprising that it  has become more prestigious than, for example, the State  Intelligence Coordinating Board (BAKIN), an agency given the  task of coordinating all existing intelligence agencies.    However, the conspicuous role played by BAIS is  understandable because it has networks at several levels. At the  territorial level, for example, BAIS can take advantage of  ABRI's existing apparatus, i.e., KODAM [Military Area Command],  KOREM [Military Sub-Area Command], KODIM [Military District  Command] and KORAMIL [Military Precinct Command], and in fact,  if necessary, as far down as the BABINSA [village management  noncommissioned officer] at the village level. On the other  hand, BAKIN, as a coordinating body, does not need a  wide-ranging network, even though it has a limited number of  field "correspondents."    BAIS plays an important role, and the strength of this  agency  can also be seen in the number of BAIS "alumni" who have gone on  to hold important positions within ABRI and in government  administration. Because, according to one of its "alumni,"  holding a position in BAIS means having the opportunity to learn  about territorial problems and national sociopolitical problems  at the same time.    Lieutenant General (at that time) L.B. Moerdani, who was  promoted to commanding general of ABRI for the period 1983 to  1988 and minister of defense and security from 1988 to 1993,  came out of BAIS headquarters on Saharjo Street in the Tebet  area of South Jakarta. A number of the aides who were with Benny  Moerdani when he led the Strategic Intelligence Center--before  it became BAIS--have become key leaders in ABRI and the  government. Examples are Admiral (retired) M. Arifin (former  Navy chief of staff); Rear Admiral (ret.) Sudibjo Rahardjo  (former KASUM ABRI), now ambassador to Singapore; Rear Marshal  (ret.) Teddy Rusdi (former assistant for general planning);  Major General (ret.) Nugroho (former junior attorney general for  intelligence and secretary general of the Department of Home  Affairs); and Lieutenant General (ret.) Sudibyo, who still heads  BAKIN. There are also a number of other high-ranking officers  who have risen fast, such as Major General A.M. Hendropriyono  (commander of the Greater Jakarta Military Area Command) and  Brigadier General Agum Gumelar (commander of Special Mission  Forces).    The conspicuous role that BAIS has played is the work of its  founder, L.B. Moerdani. This agency goes back to the Strategic  Intelligence Center (PUSINTELSTRAT), which was under the command  of ABRI Headquarters. Benny Moerdani has headed that agency  since 1977 and he has also been assistant for intelligence at  ABRI Headquarters since 1974. In the late 1970's and the early  1980's he was also entrusted with the task of heading two other  important intelligence agencies: he was deputy head of BAKIN and  head of intelligence at KOPKAMTIB [Operational Command for the  Restoration of Security and Order].    Not long after Lieut. Gen. Benny was inaugurated as  commanding general of ABRI in 1983, PUSINTELSTRAT became BAIS.  Richard Tanter, an Australian observer of Indonesian  intelligence agencies, thinks that BAIS was formed due to the  efforts made by Benny, who thought that ABRI needed a  centralized and professional intelligence agency. "It was needed  to watch over even the smallest activities and to have the  ability to prevent or, if necessary, take action against  activities not approved by the government," said Tanter, who now  teaches at Kyoto University.    He also said that the formation of BAIS, with all its  authority, was inspired by Gen. Benny's observation of the South  Korean Central Intelligence Agency (KCIA) in the 1970's, when he  served as defense attache in that country. "Benny very much  wanted to create a more professional and sophisticated ABRI  intelligence agency," Tanter told TEMPO.    Although Benny was already the commanding general of ABRI,  he  still held the position of head of BAIS. For day-to-day  operations he was helped by the deputy chairman of BAIS, at that  time Maj. Gen. Sutaryo. After he was no longer commanding  general of ABRI and head of BAIS, Benny Moerdani (later to  become minister of defense and security) continued to be very  influential at the "Saharjo office."    In his doctoral dissertation at Monash University in  Australia, entitled "Intelligence Agencies in Third World  Militarisation, a Case Study of Indonesia 1966-1989," Tanter  describes how at that time the deputy chairman of BAIS, Maj.  Gen. Sutaryo, reported to two bosses: Try Sutrisno, commanding  general of ABRI, and Benny Moerdani, minister of defense and  security.    This structure, in which the head of BAIS was also the  commanding general of ABRI, was heavily criticized, even though  it was considered effective. "Intelligence must be separate from  direct force. Intelligence must be independent," said Sutopo  Yuwono, former head of BAKIN. The products of intelligence  should stop at the stage of a "report" to the power holders. The  power holders will make policy based on those intelligence  reports. But since there are functions and posts held by both  the power holders and the intelligence agencies at the same  time, the results of the intelligence reports can be used to  create power.    So Sutopo welcomes the plans for restructuring ABRI's  intelligence bodies. "That's the way it should have been," he  said. The head of BIA will not be the commanding general of ABRI  as well. The number of directorates will also be reduced from  eight to five (see diagram).    The change in structure will not make BIA's scope of  operations very different from those of BAIS. The scope of  operations, put simply, can still be formulated as an agency  which estimates threats within a strategic range which might  endanger the state, especially those connected with domestic and  foreign social, political, economic, and cultural problems. At  the same time, ASINTEL, structurally below ABRI's KASUM, will  deal with matters directly connected with ABRI's operational  tactics and strategies. In other words, whatever its name and  position within an organization, "intelligence remains ABRI's  eyes and ears".    So who will be the first head of BIA? Rumors are that it  will  be Major General Arie Sudewo, the present deputy head of BAIS.  In fact, rumors are that he will also hold the position of  ASINTEL KASUM of ABRI. These changes will invite attention. Some  people are pleased and some are still taking a "wait-and-see"  attitude. Some people connect these changes with the  government's response to society's demands for a lower approach  to security. And some people connect them with government  efforts to present a democratic image.    As retired Brig. Gen. Soedibjo, former defense attache in  Moscow and now on the staff of the Indonesian Strategic Studies  Agency, said, "Such tight control, supported by a complex  organization, might no longer be necessary." For example, the  problem of the recent flare-up of demonstrations. As long as  those demonstrations are not aimed at overthrowing the  government or replacing the constitution, "Let the police handle  it; you don't need the intelligence agencies. People don't feel  restrained any more."    However, there are some who are not completely sure that  these changes have any great importance for Indonesian political  life. Changing the structure of BAIS into BIA is like "changing  your hat." The objective is the same. Whether it is more of a  "tight fit" or a "loose fit" depends completely on who is using  those "eyes and ears."    Or, as Tanter said, at first glance BIA will play less of a  role than BAIS. "Maybe there will be a change in operational  style and method. But I'm not convinced that its influence and  power will diminish," he said. But he would still like to know  who the head of BIA and its five directors will be, and what  their influence on and relations with the commanding general of  ABRI and the president will be, which are certainly much further  away.</p>

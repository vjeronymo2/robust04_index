			<p>940312 FT  12 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Wild beast's real problems Sir, The gist of Angus Foster's piece ('Taming the wild beast' - March 4) is that Brazil has had unacceptably high inflation, the Urv may force it down but not keep it there, and the finance minister might act as kingmaker to himself or someone else. Brazil's real problems were not mentioned, giving the impression that the pursuit of macro-economic stability was all that is required. While not an insignificant ingredient of an environment which may be conducive to growth and prosperity, macro-economic stability alone is insufficient. Tackling a record of poor governance and facing head on the endemic poverty of many of its citizens are among a long list of complementary factors required. Without these, resources devoted to achieving macro-economic stability will just be wasted. Parvis Dabir-Alai, Richmond College, Richmond, Surrey TW10 6JP</p>

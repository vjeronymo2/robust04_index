			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Management: Clash of steel as beer can battle is joined - Gary Mead looks at moves to woo designers away from aluminium British Steel's tin plate division has just paid Pounds 16,000 for 150 empty cans of non-existent, fictitious beer. Everyone knows that premium lagers are absurdly expensive, but surely Pounds 106 a can is just a little extravagant? British Steel shareholders can relax; their money is not being wasted but invested in a project which could well turn out to be a clever marketing investment in steel's battle with aluminium manufacturers over who supplies the metal for the 7bn beer and beverage cans sold annually in the UK. This week, British Steel's tin plate division is taking a stall at the international packaging exhibition - Pakex '92 - at the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham. The hope is that the collection of fake beer cans - with invented names like 'Old Guinea Stout' - will persuade packagers that a combination of technical innovation and design work means that steel meets their requirements. Though empty, the cans were neither cheap nor easy to produce. Lewis Moberly, the London designers, took on the commission a year ago. The brief was to come up with designs which would display a new tin plate steel to the best visual effect. British Steel is now pushing ahead a marketing drive which uses Moberly's beer-can designs as examples of what can be done with the new type of tin plate. While most food cans around the world are made of steel, there is an international battle between steel and aluminium for the important beer and beverage sector. In the UK this market is divided almost equally between steel and aluminium. In Germany and Holland, steel has about 90 per cent of the market but if you buy a canned drink in the US, it is almost certainly going to be in aluminium. British Steel now regards itself as competing in an international market and its drive to gain market share is both technical and marketing driven. On the technical side, British Steel's research and development arm has reduced the weight of the average steel can by 53 per cent since 1968. David Jones, research and development manager at the tin plate division, says: 'We think that aluminium has now reached its weight reduction limit, whereas we believe we can reduce the weight of a 33cl steel can by another 33 per cent in a fairly short time, which means that steel will become very competitive.' Removing one of the main competitive advantages of aluminium - low weight - without sacrificing the greatest asset of steel - its strength - will give vital marketing advantages. But as the two metals close the weight gap, the competition focuses on less tangible areas, such as appearance and design qualities. Jones says: 'We are not just marketing tin plate but marketing tin plate as a finished product.' Julie Bell, in charge of the tin plate division's marketing development, picked up from brewers that their marketing managers had hit on a more metallic look as a means of attracting supermarket shoppers to high premium beers. 'The premium perception is actually for a metallic look. It was using the look of the metal itself in the design. If you look along the shelves, the majority of the premium beers show a lot more metal on the can.' Given that aluminium has a naturally brighter appearance than tin plate, British Steel risked losing out on the high premium beer canning market. Consequently, it has been working to develop a new and brighter look to its tin plate steel. It now manufactures what it calls a 'bright' tin plated steel, with as great a shininess as aluminium. The bright tin plate gave Moberly's designers something new to work on, to demonstrate to both brewers and other designers that there is an alternative to aluminium even if they want to go for a sparkling metallic look.</p>

			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Survey of The Food Industry (1): An appetite for growth - Europe's makers and distributors of food, with sales of Dollars 600bn a year, are licking their lips at the prospect of a single market. But the continent's gastronomic diversity should ensure that the day of the homogenous 'Eurosausage' will never dawn AFTER the acquisition binge in the late 1980s, the European food industry was bound to pause for digestion. Recession and fewer obvious large takeover targets meant the chances of another NJR Nabisco buyout and break-up last year were remote. But the large players such as Nestle, Unilever, Philip Morris and BSN which fought over morsels during the Dollars 25bn Nabisco feast are far from replete. True to the best gastronomic traditions, they are merely enjoying un trou normand - a breather to cleanse their palates before they tuck into another course of takeovers and unbundlings. While the size of European takeovers may never be the same again, numerous smaller deals in the past year suggest the Dollars 600bn European food market is nevertheless changing at a rapid pace. New names are emerging: Cereal Partners in breakfast cereals; old names are popping up in new sectors - BSN in biscuits in the UK and Mars in ice cream; and old players are bowing out in the face of competition - Ranks Hovis McDougall in cereals. The most obvious change in the last year is the recession that has struck most markets to a varying degrees. After a decade in which food manufacturers enjoyed both strong margin and profit growth, their 'recession proof' tags are now being severely tested. By and large they appear to be living up to their reputation, says David Lang, who heads Henderson Crosthwaite's food team. 'The recession looks bad but feels OK,' he says. Not only does the industry appear to be holding its own, but the sharp fall in consumer spending has brought surprisingly few signs even of trading down, according to Christopher Haskins, the chairman of Northern Foods, one of the largest suppliers of fresh food to Marks and Spencer. 'The high street has been hit but fresh food sales are holding up partly because the restaurant trade is suffering and people are eating more at home,' says Haskins. A similar picture emerges from continental Europe, where recession has bitten less deeply but food again appears among the last items cut from shopping lists. Looking beyond recession, the industry's biggest challenge remains the single market in 1992. Manufacturers have tempered early optimism, which at its most unrealistic envisaged a homogenous market of 320m people emerging almost overnight. They are now most excited by the chance to shake up the way they source and distribute products. For the first time, says Morris Tabaksblat, the chairman of Unilever's food executive, large markets will be supplied from fewer plants that are no longer constrained within national borders. There should be no reason why Nestle, for example, should not ship Findus fish fingers from Grimsby on Humberside as far afield as Sicily (Sicilian tastes permitting). But these opportunities may only be enjoyed by the likes of Nestle, BSN of France, Unilever and Philip Morris, some analysts say. What does an 'enlarged' Europe hold for smaller and medium sized companies which do not have sector-leading brands and lack the muscle of their bigger competitors? 'Most category followers are too broadly based,' says Jim Grover, a director of OC&amp;C Strategy Consultants. 'The number one in a brand can spend huge amounts on advertising support and the retailers are increasingly discriminating against weaker brands in terms of pricing and listing. For sector followers, life is tough.' Just how tough it can be for 'followers' - and why companies are likely to continue paying fancy prices for strong brands - is demonstrated in the recent Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry into Nestle's dominant position in soluble coffee. The report absolved Nestle of any wrong doing but nevertheless showed its return on capital for coffee was 114 per cent. Its nearest rival, General Foods, earned 29 per cent and the third player, Lyons Tetley, a mainly own label supplier, earned only 10 per cent, the report showed. Smaller companies with weaker brands in the enlarged European market as well as in domestic markets may have to shrink and play to their strengths in order to survive, says Grover. An example of a group concentrating on its strongest suit is the recent sale by Bahlsen, the German biscuits group, of its Gubor subsidiary to Hershey Foods, the largest US chocolate confectioner. Even mighty Unilever appears to have recognised its relative weakness in the manufacture of meat pies when it sold a Mattessons Wall's factory to Northern Foods earlier this year. While unbundlings, such as these, may be limited in scope and number at the moment, a new wave of European food industry demergers is on its way. More businesses will be put up for sale and each market sector will see fewer and fewer players, says Henderson Crosthwaite's Lang. More immediately, food manufacturers may already be stumbling on to a rockier path after the smooth ascent of profits and margins in the late 1980s. Some analysts see recent results from Dalgety and United Biscuits as the first signs of the harder times. First of all, many markets and product categories are mature in northern Europe. Secondly, the easiest cost savings have already been made. And, perhaps most significantly, manufacturers are facing an increasingly sophisticated and powerful retail trade. Here again size talks; the Nestle coffee salesman is unlikely to have to fight the retailer for shelf space or margin. But retailers are beginning to limit the number of suppliers they deal with and are increasingly trying to claw back margin from weaker brands, says Grover. Sophisticated store checkout systems and central distribution networks are also helping reduce the stock levels retailers hold - effectively forcing the food manufacturers to hold stock for them. Tesco, for example, has halved the amount of stock it carries over the past five years. In continental Europe, no such sophistication exists even in the large retailers such as France's Carrefour, where local ordering and distribution remains the norm. One obvious way the industry will overcome these constraints on growth is to continue to innovate. Ten years ago, who would have given fresh pre-prepared meals much of a chance? But this market was made by technological advances that led to shorter production runs, rapid information transfer from store to factory and advances in bug detection. Mars's formidably successful transfer of its Mars bar brand to ice cream suggests the industry has plenty of resourcefulness up its sleeve. The industry will also capitalise on changes in habits and taste. 'In Northern Europe, quality improvements and a drive towards convenience foods will keep the momentum of growth going,' says Unilever's Tabaksblat. As tastes change it is not always clear whether the consumer is leading the manufacturer or vice versa. Consumers by and large remain conservative but there is a role for manufacturers to lead with new products, as Mars ice cream experience shows. In general, though, manufacturers will be following or leading a trend towards value and safety combined with convenience and variety, according to the Leatherhead Food Research Association. Food will increasingly be bought and marketed for its perceived health benefits, although manufacturers believe that the pure 'green' market will remain a small part of the total market. There will be a continuing decline in the use of preservatives, emulsifiers and stabilisers while tins will give way to frozen and fresh food. And following the Food Safety Act's implementation in January, manufacturers will be increasingly anxious to raise safety standards. This is already creating a whole new market for suppliers of food monitoring equipment that can be installed on high speed production lines. As if all this was not already enough for Europe's food industry, they are also aware of the increasing interest shown by US giants anxious to spread beyond their mature markets. Looking at the already crowded dinner table, they must be counting their blessings that the Japanese have yet to develop a real appetite for Europe. The Food Industry of the Future.

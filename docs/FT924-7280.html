			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow falls despite signs of revival Wall Street DESPITE new signs of economic life, US share prices fell across the board in light trading yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 27.29 at 3,205.74, at its lows for the day. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also finished lower, down 1.61 at 420.82, while the Amex composite slipped 2.86 to 386.83. The Nasdaq composite, which has performed strongly in recent weeks on exceptionally heavy buying, gave back some of its recent gains, declining 3.15 to 634.01. Turnover on the NYSE was 174m shares. The morning's economic statistics failed to spur demand for stocks, even though the 0.3 per cent rise in October industrial production and the 0.1 percentage point gain in capacity utilisation were both slightly higher than forecasts. Instead, investors focused on a few third-quarter earnings reports, notably from Toys 'R' Us and Kmart, which disappointed expectations, and on a big earnings downgrade of the airline industry from Wall Street. At one stage share prices staged a brief recovery, aided by comments from President-elect Clinton which suggested he would not be scaling back his plans to aid the economic recovery, but a late sell-off sent shares to new lows. Airline stocks fell sharply after after the securities house First Boston drastically reduced its earnings estimates for the industry. Delta Air Lines, which saw its 1993 estimate slashed from a profit of Dollars 2 a share to a loss of Dollars 3.50 a share, plunged Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars 53 1/4 . UAL fell Dollars 5 to Dollars 118 7/8 , AMR, parent of American Airlines, dropped Dollars 2 to Dollars 63 1/4 and USAir eased Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 13 1/8 . Kmart fell Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 27 1/4 after reporting that third quarter net income was 27 cents a share, only slightly better than the 25 cents a share recorded a year earlier. Although the per-share earnings figure was distorted by the impact of newly issued shares on the calculation, Kmart's performance in the quarter disappointed some investors. There was a similar response to the earnings report from Toys 'R' Us, which showed profits up marginally to 12 cents a share in the July to September period. The news left the toy retailer's shares Dollars  5/8 lower at Dollars 36. American Reliance fell Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 6 1/4 on the American Stock Exchange after reporting a third-quarter loss of Dollars 11.92 a share, a sharp deterioration from the 45 cents a share profit in the year-ago period. On the Nasdaq market some leading technology stocks ran into selling as investors consolidated recent gains. Borland International fell Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 28 3/4 , Microsoft gave up Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 92 3/4 and Oracle Systems, undermined by a broker's downgrade, dropped Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 21 3/4 . Canada TORONTO stocks ended sharply weaker, pressured by a steep rise in Canadian prime rates which sidelined many players and sent ripples through Canada's stock, bond and currency markets. The TSE-300 composite index ended down 33.1 points or 1.01 per centt at 3,236.4 on light turnover of 28.5 million shares worth CDollars 258.6 million, compared with volume of 49.26 million shares on Friday valued at CDollars 467.48 million.</p>

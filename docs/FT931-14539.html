			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Arts: Today's Television Class changed In Don't Bank on Us (ITV, 8.30) the World in Action team promises to set the vital juices flowing by reporting on the unpopularity of Britain's banks, which have experienced a decline in public esteem surpassed only by the monarchy. Evidence will be provided to show that the banks are consistently overcharging to take them through the recession. Still talking money, but in this case won through straightforward dishonesty, Cutting Edge: Fraud Squad (C4, 9.0) goes on the trail with the Metropolitan Fraud Squad and follows successful investigations into three uncomplicated, small-beer cases. One of them involves a fraudulent hospital appeal, another is a 'Nigerian fraud' of the type which, although highly publicised in the last few years, still manages, remarkably enough, to find gullible victims. On a markedly more elevated plane, we come a little closer to the Russian soul with the second part of Writing on the Edge (C4, 11.00), a semi-dramatised portrayal of the relationship between art and political commitment in the life of the poet Alexander Pushkin.</p>

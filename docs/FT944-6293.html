			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Their Budget): The rail controller Alastair Fyfe, 34: Duty control manager for European Passenger Services, supervising running of trains on UK side of Channel Tunnel. Married with two daughters aged three and one. Earns: Pounds 26,000. Has Pounds 80,000 mortgage. Politics: Voted Scottish Nationalist in last election. Thinks he would vote Lib-Dem now. Wanted: More spending on pre-school nurseries and tax breaks for users of company supervised creches. More funds for NHS and public transport and the creation of an integrated network of roads and railways. Incentives to transfer freight from road to rail. Said yesterday: 'Proposals to reduce the government's direct contribution to rail spending represent a missed opportunity and show the government only pays lip service to green policies. I was disappointed that no extra money was made available for pre-school nursery facilities. 'I accept the need for some increase in car fuel duty though, as a country dweller, I am happy the chancellor did not increase it by the higher amounts called for by some commentators.'</p>

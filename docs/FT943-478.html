			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Saga seeks more youthful line in pensioners You no longer have to be 60 to play Scrabble with pensioners in Torquay, roll your woods along the bowling greens of Bournemouth or go ballroom dancing on the cruise ship Canberra. Saga, the travel group which sells holidays to pensioners, is breaking with a 45-year tradition and lowering the minimum age of its customers from 60 to 50. Mr Roger De Haan, Saga's chairman and the son of its founder, said yesterday he had originally opposed the change but had accepted that his group should cater to the growing number of pensioners under 60. The change will lead to a large increase in the size of Saga's market. There are 12m UK residents over 60 and a further 6m between 50 and 60. Mr De Haan said: 'I reckon there are going to be 6m deeply depressed people contemplating the thought that they qualify for Saga holidays.' Mr De Haan, who turns 46 next month, said that research into 15 large occupational pension schemes earlier this year showed that two-thirds of employees were now retiring before they reached the age of 60. In four of the schemes, 40 per cent retired before they were 55. Research among Saga's customers found little opposition to lowering the minimum age. Some travellers in their 70s said that they had long wanted to take their 50-year-old sons and daughters on holiday with them. Saga, which is privately owned, does not reveal how many customers it has. Mr De Haan said, however, that the group sells about Pounds 100m worth of holidays a year. He said lowering the minimum age would not result in any change in Saga's established policy of ensuring its holidays were accessible even to the most frail. The group has always promised that its customers would not have to climb a hill to reach their hotel. There are porters present to carry guests' luggage. All travellers have telephone access to a 24-hour reception desk.</p>

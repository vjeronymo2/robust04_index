			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: He will or he won't The end of the first quarter. Tempus fugit. At the end of each threemonth I indulge myself no end by taking stock. I ponder my career. Examine my lifestyle. Count my money. Scrutinise my will. And estimate how many quarterly stock-takings I still have to come - about 52, by my calculation, which is not a large number, sad to say. I especially enjoy re-reading my will, and deciding which of the people mentioned in it should be given greater prominence, or moved into the shadows. People change as they get older, especially people mentioned in wills. They get nicer, or not; more grateful, or less. You have to keep on top of it, and update the paperwork. In addition to my usual stock-taking, I have been examining the predictions for 1994 made in this column on January 1, to see how they are faring. If they are proving to be idiotic my idiocy should be acknowledged, at least by me, for I claimed that they were serious predictions, even if wishful thinking had infected most of them. To calibrate my performance at the end of the first quarter, I decided to award each forecast a provisional score out of 10. Markets: displaying a machismo that was entirely uncalled for, I predicted that the FT-SE 100 would set a record high of approximately 3,660 before Easter, then endure months of choppiness before falling like a stone in September or October, and finishing the year below 3,000. As it happened, the index topped-out at 3,520.3 on February 2. I still think it will finish 1994 at a far lower level than experts were predicting on January 1. But even if it does, my other forecast - that gold would approach Dollars 500 an ounce, as a prelude to startling gains at the end of the century - is looking flyblown. I am counting on China. The Chinese love gold. Buy more, you toiling masses. Unless we all heave together, the wretched gold price is going nowhere. Provisional score out of 10: 4. US politics: I predicted 'a good year for Bill Clinton - Washington's dozy columnists will finally warm to him - and a good year, too, for Hillary Clinton.' I am sticking to my guns, storms in eggcups notwithstanding. Score: 8. UK politics: John Major would resign, to be succeeded as prime minister by Kenneth Clarke; John Smith would meander through another low-key year as Opposition leader; and something 'painful and messy' would happen to bossy Virginia Bottomley, the UK health secretary. I still believe that Major will quit Downing Street voluntarily, late in the year, probably late at night, his poor wife in tow, screaming soundlessly. And Smith is certainly snoozing through a low-key year. But Bottomley is uncrushed. In fact, still glowing. Score: 7. Sport: I like soccer, so I predicted that the World Cup would be a great success. I know almost nothing about soccer, so I predicted that Norway would beat Brazil 3-1 in the final. I also reckoned that the Grand National steeplechase at Aintree would produce a fiasco to rival last year's. Neither of these events has yet been staged. Score: 5. The monarchy: 'A good year for Prince Charles, as more and more people come to appreciate the attraction of having a divorced heir to the British throne. What could be more fin de siecle or sophisticated?' (The divorce itself was tipped for 1995). Without doubt, Prince Charles is having a good year, having launched a massive PR campaign to buttress himself against the sniggering of the populace. Score: 9. Religion: 'The Church of England will stumble ever faster towards disestablishment and outer darkness.' As forecasts go, this is one of my bankers. Score: 8. Hunting: 'People who hunt animals - big ones, small ones - will feel more and more like pariahs as revulsion at their activities becomes pronounced.' Score: 7. Journalism: Incredibly, I reckoned that news desks would realise that people are fed up with coverage of Russia and China, and wanted about 30 years' silence from those two countries while they licked their wounds and smartened-up their acts. Score: 0. My average provisional score is thus six out of 10. This is not a good score. It has made me gloomy. To revive my spirits, I have torn up my will and am starting again from scratch. The fun is quite considerable.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by L.S. Nekrasova, Institute of Plant and Animal </F> Ecology at Russian Academy of Sciences, Urals Department; UDC  502.5:595.765.4]    [Abstract] An ecological study in the region of the  Karabash Copper Smelting Combine was begun in 1986, of concern  being the effect of this industry on the mesofauna habitating in  the soil. Soil specimens, 30x50x50 cm[.sup]3[/] large clods,  were dug up according to standard procedure at five sites: four  sites respectively 1.5-2.5-6.0-15 km south-east away from the  factory in the direction of the dominant winds, the nearest site  being a treeless hill, and one site 8 km north-west (against  those winds) away from the factory. Generally, the total biomass  and the numbers of animals were found to become smaller with  decreasing distance from the pollution source. Noteworthy is the  effect of industrial fallout on the taxonomic structure of the  mesofauna: ants dominant 1.5-2.5 km SE, earthworms dominant 15  km SE, both species and myriapodes in about equal numbers 8 km  NW, earthworms and myriapodes along with click beetles still  found 6 km SE away. Presence and absence of these species can  serve as indicator for establishing the boundary of the  ``impacted'' zone around a copper smelting plant. Acidity  measurements made in three successive soil layers yielded: pH  3.6-3.8 in the 0-5 cm deep top layers and pH 5.6-6.4 in the  15-30 cm deep lower layers at the sites nearest to the pollution  source. Only the number of ants was found not to depend on the  acidity of the top soil layer, that of all other species to  strongly depending on it. The results of studies made concerning  the phytomass in this region indicate that such a distribution  of invertebrates in the soil is due to worsening of the soil  quality in terms of phytocoenoses.

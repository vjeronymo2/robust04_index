In the first quarter of 1994,  the real gross domestic product of the old laender will increase  again over the same period of the previous year for the first  time since the end of 1992, the ministry stated Tuesday [15  March] in its monthly economic report. Despite the 0.5-percent  decline from the third to the fourth quarter of 1993, economic  activities have overcome the lowest point.    The last time the west German GDP achieved a real plus (0.9  percent) compared to the same three-months period of the  previous year was in the fourth quarter of 1992. In 1993, the  decline in the first quarter was 3.4 percent but diminished in  the course of the year to 1.9, 1.4, and finally 0.9 percent in  the last quarter.</p>

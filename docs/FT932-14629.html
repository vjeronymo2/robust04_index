			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Region volatile as Nikkei declines A wave of profit-taking by dealers, investment trusts and arbitrageurs left equities 1.8 per cent lower ahead of yesterday's summit in Washington between Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, and Mr Bill Clinton, the US president, writes Wayne Aponte in Tokyo. The Nikkei average fell 377.98 to 20,297.86, still 1.9 per cent higher on the week, after a day's high of 20,743.20 and a low of 20,225.78. The broader Topix Index of all first section issues ended 24.63 lower at 1,565.10. Volume was estimated at 550m shares compared with Thursday's 637m. Declines led advances by 821 to 271, with 99 unchanged. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.48 to 1,233.92. Losses were attributed to political uncertainty and to some nervousness over Monday's money supply data for March. Data reflecting private bank lending and demand for time deposits rose last February for the first time in six months. However, some economists expect negative figures for March, indicating slower economic recovery. In spite of the day's declines, the consensus among market participants is that the Nikkei will hold above 20,000 in the short-term. One analyst at a British brokerage said that investors were looking for fresh incentives to join the market. Profit-taking pushed Sumitomo Metal Mining, again the day's most active issue, Y22 lower at Y950. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone dropped Y10,000 to Y1.01m. The financial sector was also under pressure, with Fuji Bank down Y60 at Y1,990. Mitsubishi Bank lost Y50 to Y2,440 and the Industrial Bank of Japan dropping Y40 to Y2,600. Mazda Motor, developing a fuel efficient engine, was actively bought, gaining Y51 to Y601. In Osaka, the OSE average declined 193.86 to 21,984.83, in volume of 22.5m shares. Roundup THE REGION was mixed, and volatile. SINGAPORE hit a third consecutive closing high, the Straits Times Industrial index closing 31.95, or 1.85 per cent higher at 1,763.35, 2.6 per cent up on the week, as volume fell to 398.9m shares from Thursday's record 550.1m. KUALA LUMPUR, likewise, saw volume shrink from a record 1.04bn shares to 512.5m as the KLSE composite index rose 1.29 to a new high of 662.02, a fraction higher on the week. BANGKOK saw foreign buying and climbed by 1.6 per cent, the SET index closing 14.44 higher at 888.96, 3 per cent higher on the week, in turnover up from Bt3.1bn to Bt4.6bn. AUSTRALIA closed mixed after a strong week, with banking and industrial stocks ahead and mines mostly easier as the All Ordinaries index eased 0.9 to 1,703.2, up 2.3 per cent on the week. HONG KONG fell on profit-taking, the Hang Seng index finishing 57.70 lower at 6,732.04, still 7.1 per cent higher on a week enlivened by news of renewed Sino-British talks. Turnover was HKDollars 5.68bn against Wednesday's record HKDollars 7.74bn. TAIWAN dropped 3.4 per cent on late selling after unconfirmed local media reports that the country might be included on a list of unfair traders by the US. The weighted index slid 161.30 to 4,534.19, 6.5 per cent lower on the week in turnover of TDollars 42.87bn. SEOUL tumbled as cautious investors pulled back before the market could reach a new high for the year, the composite index falling 9.90 to 706.86, 0.6 per cent up on the week, as volume rose from 50.9m to 63.2m shares. BOMBAY picked up to close marginally ahead after a hesitant start. The BSE index finished 6.66 higher at 2,299.78 - or 0.4 per cent lower on the week - after recovering from the day's low of 2,259.71.</p>

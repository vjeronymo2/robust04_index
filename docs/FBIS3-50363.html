			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Z.L.: "Meeting of General Staff With President </F> and Prime Minister"]    [Text] According to generals of the General Staff's  strict leadership, the Army's budget planned for this year "is  not conducive to the implementation of tasks that Poland's  interests determine for the Armed Forces."    According to the generals, a lack of funds not only makes it  difficult to implement tasks that have already been planned but  also determines the fact that the process of the Army's  technical deterioration will not be stopped.    This pessimistic analysis was presented to President Lech  Walesa, commander in chief of the Armed Forces, and Prime  Minister Waldemar Pawlak during their first visit to the Polish  Army's General Staff on Thursday [27 January]. In the presence  of Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk and Mieczyslaw  Wachowski, minister of state in the President's Office, the  officers presented results of analyses and of conceptual work  pertaining to the Army's new model. The meeting was closed to  the press.    According to the plans, an "aerial-mobile," land-aerial army  is to be established within two years, whose basis will be  provided by armored forces, landing-storming forces, the air  force, and aerial cavalry, Major Mariusz Jedrzejko told us. He  is the spokesman for the Collegium of Armed Forces' Commanders  of the Republic of Poland and the only person authorized to  inform the press on the contents of Thursday's talks. The only  reason the General Staff could be happy with the talks (the  General Staff, according to recent announcements by its chief,  General Tadeusz Wilecki, is to become the chief institution for  commanding the Polish Republic's Armed Forces) was that there  were unanimous declarations made by both the head of state and  the Cabinet chief that they care very much for defense issues.    President Walesa and Prime Minister Pawlak announced that  they will support the necessary legislative changes that would  make it possible to continue with the reforms in the area of the  defense system. They also expressed their interest in the idea  of establishing a National Defense Fund that would collect  financial means from society. These would then be devoted  primarily to purchasing modern combat equipment.</p>

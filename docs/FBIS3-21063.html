The chance for plastics to  develop into a recyclable packaging material continues to  increase. Since the Federal German Packaging Ordinance went into  effect, more and more paths are bypassing the landfill.    According to Dr. Albrecht Eckell, "the question of plastic  recycling will be answered by 1998," simply by means of  raw-material recycling. Dr. Eckell is the chairman of the  Association of the Plastics Producing Industry. He said that the  chemical transformation of plastic waste back into its initial  products could recycle several hundred thousand metric tons in  the coming years. This was recently at the symposium on  "Plastics + Environment" in Cologne.    The announced recycling push is also urgently needed.  However, in the opinion of Prof. Dr. Klaus Topfer, in the  future, human labor will no longer be scarce. Rather energy, raw  materials, and environmental media will be the scarce  commodities of the economy. This will show up in the costs of  the production processes as desired by the Federal Minister of  the Environment. For this reason, he wants to continue to set  clear priorities and provide an economic stimulus for material  recycling (quota for plastics starting on 1 January 1998: at  least 60%, half of this by means of polymer  reutilization) even  in the amendment of the Packaging Ordinance. However, Topfer  also admits that thermal recycling is not only a possibility but  a necessity for the remaining 40%.    The recycling principle behind the German Packaging  Ordinance  is correct in the opinion of Wolfram Bruck. He is the manager of  Dual System Deutschland (DSD) in Bonn. "Our government was  compelled to reduce the amount of waste going to landfills  because an economy can also choke on clogged landfills." Today,  with the help of the Dual System, about 50% of the volume  has  been transferred from the trash cans of Federal German  households onto other recycling tracks.    In Cologne, Prof. Dr. Michael Droscher also confirmed the  necessity of plastics recycling. "Used plastics do not belong in  landfills," according to the chemist with a master's degree,  responsible for environmental issues at Huls. Independent of  this, there is less and less landfill space available. Droscher  says, "In 1977, there were still 1,355 landfills. Today, there  are about 290 and, by 1995, the capacity will drop again by  50%."    In spite of this, the plastics expert remains skeptical with  regard to the recycling quotas of the Minister of the  Environment. "At some specific recycling quota, we start to make  ecological nonsense," says Droscher. For this reason, the  plastic recycling should not be controlled using rigid quotas  but rather using ecological and economical factors. Droscher  says, "There is no one true path. Every recycling path must be  optimized. Processed-material recycling is to be limited to  large pure material streams. Raw-material recycling and thermal  recycling should handle large quantities of mixed plastics.  Small and highly polluted packaging should remain in the trash  and be mineralized, thus incinerated, with this trash."</p>

			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> E. CONTINI'S DEATH  </P> <P> I read with deep sadness of the passing of Edgardo Contini, FAIA. Edgardo was a  towering presence in the Los Angeles design community whose pioneering efforts  in residential land planning and design in the 1950s and 1960s created the  innovative Crestwood Hills tract in Brentwood and residential prototypes as a  part of the famous Case Study Houses program.  </P> <P> His humane design principals touched thousands of lives.  </P> <P> Edgardo was a valued friend and adviser to Architects/Designers/ Planners for  Social Responsibility, this nation's largest pro-active group of designers  (2,500 members). We at ADPSR will work hard to create a living memorial of  action and commitment to the enduring principles of environmental renewal and  responsible development that were the hallmark of Edgardo's life.  </P> <P> GARTH SHERIFF  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P> <P> Sheriff is chairman of Architects/Designers/Planners for Social Responsibility.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p><P> September 25, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ATHLETICS TAKE STEP FORWARD, 9-3  </P> <P> Dave Parker doesn't seem to be enjoying Oakland's stretch run. To hear him tell  it, winning the American League West title is a chore.  </P> <P> "We want to get it out of the way," Parker said Sunday after his two-run single  in the fifth inning helped give the Athletics a 9-3 victory over the Minnesota  Twins and put them another step ahead of the Angels. "We just want to get it  behind us and go on."  </P> <P> The A's could clinch as early as Tuesday.  </P> <P> The A's victory over the Twins combined with the Angels' loss at Cleveland put  Oakland 5 1/2 games up with a week to play, reducing their magic number to two.  </P> <P> "We'll go home now and hopefully win the next two and kill the suspense and  say, 'The hell with this,' " said Parker, who has batted .324 and driven in 18  runs during the last 17 games. "We'd like to go out and get 27 outs and do it  quietly."  </P> <P> The A's play their final seven games at home, where they are 49-25. Their 45-36  road record is the best in baseball.  </P> <P> After Parker, who leads the team in RBIs with 95, gave the A's the lead, Jose  Canseco hit a run-scoring single in the seventh, Dave Henderson singled home a  run in the ninth and Mark McGwire followed with a three-run homer, his second  of the game and 31st of the season.  </P> <P> While Oakland has won with its veteran rotation, the Twins have lost seven of  eight, with their four rookie pitchers going 0-6.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HONIG, SCHOOL BOARD STILL AT ODDS AFTER TALKS  </P> <P> Although State Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig and the State Board of  Education tried Thursday to put a good face on efforts to sort out how much  authority each should have over California educational policy, the two sides  still seemed far apart on key issues.  </P> <P> "I think we did make progress," Honig told the board's policy and planning  committee about several meetings in recent weeks. He said he was hopeful that  final agreement could be reached when the board next meets in January.  </P> <P> Said Howard L. Dickstein, special counsel to the board, "While agreement was  not reached, there was movement by the superintendent that I consider  significant."  </P> <P> However, the 35-minute discussion that followed brought out at least two  important issues on which there is still substantial disagreement:  </P> <P> * How much the 11-member board should be involved in reviewing budget decisions  made by Honig and other Department of Education administrators.  </P> <P> * What the board's role should be in appointing and evaluating top officials in  the department.  </P> <P> A Dickstein "memo of understanding" that has served as a basis for the  negotiations would give board members significantly increased authority both in  preparing the annual education budget and in making sure the funds are spent  properly.  </P> <P> For instance, the board would have to approve all personal service contracts of  more than $20,000 and changes in the budget involving expenditures of more than  $10,000.  </P> <P> Honig called these provisions "getting into the day-by-day administration of  the department" and claimed they were "taken off the table" and will remain  under his control.  </P> <P> But Dickstein disagreed, saying: "The scope of these discussions is  comprehensive. Every issue that is in that memo is being discussed."  </P> <P> Honig later suggested to reporters that he and the board might submit separate  budgets in the future and the governor and Legislature could decide which to  consider.  </P> <P> The Dickstein memo also proposes that the board approve high-level Department  of Education appointments and review the employees' performance annually.  Additionally, it calls on Honig to appoint a deputy superintendent and three  associate superintendents, positions that are called for in the state  Constitution but have been left vacant during his eight years in office.  </P> <P> Instead of making these appointments, which are for four-year terms, Honig has  used another process to hire top aides whose terms are indefinite.  </P> <P> The superintendent indicated Thursday that he would not agree to adopt the  procedure set out in the Dickstein memo.  </P> <P> The principal issue between the superintendent and the board is how involved  the board, made up of part-time appointees of the governor, should be in  managing the 1,400-employee department.  </P> <P> Honig said he is willing to grant the board "policy review" but would continue  to resist what he called "day-by-day micro-management."  </P> <P> But what the superintendent sees as "micro-management" is a crucial part of  what some board members are seeking.  </P> <P> "I think it's absolutely essential that the board have control over program  mix, dollar mix and any promiscuous movement of money from one program to  another," Board President Joseph D. Carrabino said.  </P> <P> So far, board members have not succeeded even in obtaining office space and  telephones.  </P> <P> When Carrabino raised that issue, Honig said that was "one of the items in the  discussion" and should be part of a final "package."  </P></p>

			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Support is growing in Norway for EU entry Norwegians are warming to membership of the European Union, according to an opinion poll published yesterday in the tabloid daily Dagbladet, writes Karen Fossli from Oslo. The poll showed a three percentage point gain from January to 36 per cent in favour of Norway's application to join the EU. Opposition fell two points to 52 per cent. Norway is currently negotiating accession to the EU alongside Sweden, Finland and Austria, but its electorate has voiced the fiercest resistance of the four countries' voters to the move. However, fears about developments in neighbouring Russia, where nationalists gained the largest vote in recent parliamentary elections, have swelled support for EU membership, say analysts. Those undecided about joining the Union dropped one percentage point to 12 per cent, but overall support for EU membership is the strongest in more than six months.</p>

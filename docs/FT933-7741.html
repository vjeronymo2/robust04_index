			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading STRONG overseas demand drove the derivatives sector sharply ahead, sending the September Footsie futures contract to a new peak, and brought healthy turnover in the traded options, writes Joel Kibazo. In futures, a firm start to trading in the September contract on the FT-SE 100 at 3,042 was followed by strong demand, in anticipation of favourable data on inflation. Confirmation of good inflation figures, together with good demand from US buyers, drove the contract further ahead, with UK institutions said to have been largely absent from the day's main action. This developed into a squeeze, in which the futures led the cash market higher. It finished at 3,086, up 55 from the previous close and around 4 points above the estimated fair value premium to cash of about 7 points. A premium of between 10 and 15 points was seen for most of the session. By the close a hefty 17,086 contracts had been traded, the daily average for this year being 11,313 lots. Active dealing in the index options, ahead of Friday's expiry, made a significant contribution to strong volume in the traded options. Total turnover reached 73,642, of which 29,434 was dealt in the FT-SE 100 option and 8,796 in the Euro FT-SE option. The combined average volume for the two options this year stands at 10,985 lots. British Steel was the busiest stock option.</p>

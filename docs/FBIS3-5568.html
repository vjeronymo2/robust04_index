Chang Pyong-yong, chief of the Defense Ministry's special  inspection team, said this when he announced the results of its  two-month investigation into the eight Yulgok projects.    Chief Chang said: "The 240 billion-won Phantom upgrade  project was feasible when it was first mapped out in 1988.  However, when we examined the project now, we found that we  have no reason to go ahead with this project because it is not  efficient and because we will not be able to obtain much  aviation technology from it."    The Defense Ministry decided to reimburse the investment of  Samsung Aviation in this project (four billion won).    The Piho project (one trillion 19.5 billion won) was  designed  to develop 30 mm antiair guns. The plan requires imports of  major technologies and parts from foreign countries, and, as a  result, the local content of the equipment will be a mere 44.4  percent. However, the ministry decided to reorganize this  project, because its cancellation would result in a loss of the  international credibility of the local corporations involved.    The ministry also decided to go ahead with some of the  projects under investigation, including the marine patrol  aircraft project (602.3 billion), the Sangmu project (560  billion won) [a project to relocate the Army Training and  Doctrine Command in Kwangju], the destroyer project (110 billion  won), and the Naval Tactical Data System project (15.6 billion).  Nevertheless, the ministry decided to readjust the excessively  appropriated expenses. [passage omitted]</p>

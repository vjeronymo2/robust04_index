			<p><P> April 4, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> PESTICIDE TRUCK DRIVER KILLED IN 2-CAR CRASH  </P> <P> The driver of a truck carrying pesticides was fatally injured when his vehicle  overturned after hitting two cars on the southbound Hollywood Freeway near  Oxnard Street in North Hollywood, authorities said.  </P> <P> No chemicals were spilled in the 11 a.m. accident, according to California  Highway Patrol Officer Dave Grajeda. The driver, who was not identified since  relatives had not been notified, died of head, chest and abdominal injuries  shortly after being taken to Saint Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, hospital  spokeswoman Lori Hull said.  </P> <P> The pesticide truck made an erratic lane change, clipped the right rear end of  one car, struck the rear of another car and overturned, Grajeda said. The  driver was thrown from the truck, he said. No other injuries were reported.  </P> <P> Authorities closed the southbound off-ramp to Oxnard Street for about 45  minutes after the accident, causing heavy delays for southbound traffic,  Grajeda said. Witnesses told the CHP that other vehicles -- in addition to the  truck and the two autos -- were involved in the accident, but the drivers left  the scene and made no reports, Grajeda said.  </P></p>

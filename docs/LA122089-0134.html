			<p><P> December 20, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOTELS FIGHT HOLIDAY SLUMP WITH BARGAINS;  </P> <P> LODGING: ORANGE COUNTY HOTELIERS FIND THAT LOWER-THAN-USUAL OCCUPANCY RATES  THIS CHRISTMAS SEASON CAP A DISAPPOINTING YEAR FOR TOURISM.  </P> <P> With Christmas only days away, one of the best bargains these days isn't on the  retailers' racks. It was at Orange County's hotels.  </P> <P> Just as sure as there are jammed stores and packed parking lots at area malls,  it is a certainty that the holidays will be the slowest time of the year for  the lodging industry. And Orange County's hoteliers are finding that this  season is no exception.  </P> <P> "It's the worst I've seen in the past 23 years," bemoaned John Hill, general  manager of the Heritage Inn in Fullerton.  </P> <P> The occupancy level at the 124-room Heritage is down about 30% for November and  December compared to the same period in 1988, he said. Hill attributes this  year's drop to fewer Asian tourists and the countywide glut of hotels.  </P> <P> While others are more optimistic, the Heritage is by no means alone.  </P> <P> "Business travelers as well as tourists just don't travel as much," said Sandra  Louvier, a hotel consultant with the accounting firm of Laventhol &amp; Horwath  in Costa Mesa. "So it's not unusual for (hotel occupancy rates) to run in the  40% or 50% range."  </P> <P> Compounding the seasonal problem this year is the fact that 1989 has been, at  best, a disappointing year for tourism in Orange County.  </P> <P> The result? Hotels from Fullerton to Dana Point are following what has become a  Christmas tradition: slashing room rates and offering special package deals.  Consider, for example, these basement-level bargains on room rates:  </P> <P> * The Disneyland Hotel -- generally acknowledged to be one of the most  successful in the county -- is offering a special rate of $99 per couple on  Sunday, Monday and Tuesday. That compares to a usual rate of $150 to $180 for  each night in those same accommodations.  </P> <P> * Through New Year's eve, the Newport Beach Marriott Hotel and Tennis Club has  a $99 special for its Two for Breakfast Promotion, which includes a double room  for one night, plus breakfast the next morning. By lowering the usual daily  rate of about $164 for doubles, marketing director Greg Smith estimates that  the 600-room hotel fills another 15 to 20 rooms each night.  </P> <P> * The Hyatt Regency Alicante in Garden Grove is offering package deals to the  Freedom Bowl or Disneyland, including a one-night stay and two tickets to the  football game or the theme park, priced at $125 and $128, respectively. That  compares with the ordinary rate of $139 per night for a double room, without  other amenities.  </P> <P> * Even the exclusive Ritz-Carlton Laguna Niguel has a holiday package. The deal  costs $350 per couple for two nights' stay in the ocean-view hotel, and  includes a gift basket loaded with luxury tidbits such as champagne and a gift  booklet for shopping at South Coast Plaza's Crystal Court annex. Ordinarily,  rooms at the Ritz-Carlton go for $185 to $360 per night.  </P> <P> What they are all trying to do is put some life into the deadest time of the  year, a time when meetings and convention business has wound down and what  pleasure travelers there are often prefer to stay with family or friends.  </P> <P> "Nobody likes to be away from home during the holidays," said Smith of the  Newport Beach Marriott. "So hotels just aren't the hot spots over the holidays  -- at least to sleep, anyway."  </P> <P> The countywide numbers for 1988 give a good indication of just how low  occupancy can go during the off-season. Consider that all of Orange County had  a 53.7% occupancy level last December -- contrasted with a 68.4% occupancy  level for the county during all of 1988, according to Pannell Kerr Forster, an  accounting firm that monitors the hotel industry.  </P> <P> Industry experts say in general that an occupancy level of about 65% is needed  for a hotel to make money. So if they had to depend on holiday traffic alone,  it would be a depressing business.  </P> <P> "You would not build a hotel for that type of occupancy," said Jim Burba, a  partner with Pannell Kerr in Irvine, referring to holiday occupancy levels.  "But everyone realizes that's part of the business and plans for it  accordingly."  </P> <P> So hotels look for ways to lure guests and trim expenses. They generally lower  prices as an enticement and many hotels reduce their staff to cut costs.  </P> <P> "Most hotels have no choice but to lay off a tremendous amount of workers in  order to counteract expenses," said William Torresala, general manager of the  Pan Pacific Hotel in Anaheim.  </P> <P> While the Pan Pacific this year opted to keep all of its regular employees  during December, Torresala said some hotels will lay off as much as 50% of  their staff -- especially housekeepers, gardeners, bellmen and front desk  personnel -- for half of December.  </P> <P> Sprucing up the premises by adding a bit of Christmas cheer never hurt  occupancy, either. That's why the Ritz-Carlton, for example, starts its  celebrating soon after Thanksgiving with a ceremony to light its 50-foot tree.  </P> <P> "Since December is the weakest month of the year, we had two choices," said  Henry Schielein, general manager at the 393-room hotel. "Either lay everyone  off and close up shop or create other options."  </P> <P> In addition to offering package rates, those other options at the Ritz-Carlton  have come to include carolers, puppet shows, a gigantic gingerbread house and a  display of 130,000 white lights -- all of which are heavily promoted.  </P> <P> The strategy seems to work. Since the hotel began actively promoting Christmas  a few years ago, occupancy in December has climbed to the low 60s from the low  40s, Schielein said, making the Ritz among the most successful in the area.  </P> <P> The hotel industry also relies heavily on holiday parties and New Year's Eve to  bring in much needed revenue dollars at the end of the year.  </P> <P> With Christmas celebrations, year-ender parties and employees being taken to  lunch, the Newport Beach Marriott, for instance, sees probably a 15% jump in  food and beverage sales in December, Smith estimated.  </P> <P> O.C. HOTELS SUFFER DECEMBER SLOWDOWN  </P> <P> OCCUPANCY RATES  </P> <P> While occupancy rates plunged last December, a boom in food and beverage sales  helped the county's hotels hang on until the new year.  </P> <P> Anaheim  </P> <P> Dec. 1988: 54.3%  </P> <P> 1988 annual percentage: 72.8%  </P> <P> Airport/Newport Beach  </P> <P> Dec. 1988: 53.7%  </P> <P> 1988 annual percentage: 63.4%  </P> <P> North county  </P> <P> Dec. 1988: 49.8%  </P> <P> 1988 annual percentage: 62.5%  </P> <P> South county  </P> <P> Dec. 1988: 52.1%  </P> <P> 1988 annual percentage: 66.3%  </P> <P> DAILY FOOD AND BEVERAGE SPENDING PER ROOM  </P> <P> Food and beverage revenues increased last December in all but the northern part  of the county.  </P> <TABLE CWL="3.43IN:1.89IN:2.00IN:2.22IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="4"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1988  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> December  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Percent  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Region  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Average  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1988  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Difference  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Anaheim  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $30.08  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $32.11  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 6.7  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Airport/Newport Beach  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 35.97  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 41.42  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 17.1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> North County  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 18.58  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 17.78  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> -5.6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> South County  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 40.01  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 48.54  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 20.0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> Source: Pannell Kerr Forster  </P></p>

			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / International Company News: Domtar reduces deficit DOMTAR, the Canadian forest products, building materials and packaging group, reduced losses in the third quarter with higher shipments, lower operating costs and a lower Canadian dollar. Most of Domtar's pulp and paper is exported to the US while it operates a large US gypsum wallboard business. A lower dollar increases Domtar's exchange gains. The loss was CDollars 32m (USDollars 25.67m), or 26 cents a share, against a loss of CDollars 39m, or 43 cents, a year earlier, on sales of Dollars 482m, up 6 per cent. Fine paper sales were stable and sales of market pulp and groundwood papers were up 15 per cent. Packaging results were little changed. Building materials sales rose 13 per cent but wallboard prices were weak. Domtar's nine months' loss was CDollars 117m, or CDollars 1.02 a share, against a loss of CDollars 104m, or CDollars 1.22, a year earlier. The first quarter this year was the worst. Nine months' sales were up 3 per cent overall to CDollars 1.4bn.</p>

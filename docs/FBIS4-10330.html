			<p>BFN     [Text] Guatemala City, 11 Apr (AFP) -- A girl of U.S.  nationality was kidnapped today as she was on her way to school.  Despite the silence of authorities and the school, diplomatic  sources learned that the girl's father is a businessman.    Sources from the Attorney General's Office who spoke with  AFP  and asked to remained anonymous identified the girl as  seven-year-old Georgina Rosse Robyn, the daughter of a U.S.  businessman who exports nontraditional products in Guatemala.    According to this report, the girl was abducted by  unidentified persons shortly after leaving her home in a  residential neighborhood in southern Guatemala City.    Thus far, both the U.S. Embassy and the principal's office  of  Maya School, which the girl attends, have remained silent and  have neither confirmed nor denied the news, which was also  disclosed by Police sources.    Two weeks ago the U.S. Embassy in Guatemala warned U.S.  citizens of future attacks in retaliation for the presumed  abduction of Guatemalan children by U.S. citizens.    Recently an Alaskan photographer was accused of abducting  children and was attacked by a mob in a rural town. The  individual was hospitalized in serious condition.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia's Democratic Choice leaders' plans to remove  Director of the Federal Counterintelligence Service (FCS) Sergey  Stepashin from office is "yet another attempt to play the  political card and distract the attention of the public from the  president's efforts to combat crime," FCS spokesman Aleksandr  Mikhailov told INTERFAX on Tuesday.    The party's political council, led by Yegor Gaydar,  announced  that it would insist on the resignation of Stepashin if the  latter did not distance himself from the earlier made statement  that he was in favor of violating the rights of the individual,  if this individual is a criminal.    Mikhailov said that by making such a statement during the  enlarged session of the Collegium of the Prosecutor-General's  Office on June 23, Stepashin meant the right "to kill, rob and  rape", appropriated by criminals.    He also said that Stepashin, the chairman of the former  parliamentary committee for investigating the activities of the  KGB, had a clear position: the campaign to combat crime must be  put on a solid legal footing. The counterintelligence personnel  intend to act in strict accordance with legal acts while  implementation the presidential decree on combating organized  crime, said Mikhailov.    He said the people who are trying to play the FCS card once  again must not forget President Yeltsin's statement that "a  strong Russia needs strong special services."</p>

Economic problems militate against the optimistic scenario of  maintaining 1993's rhythm of inflation (an average rate of 46  percent.)    Garcia believes that this government has inherited a  profound  economic and financial crisis, whose solution becomes more  difficult because of the country's social problems and the  restrictions that Caldera himself spoke of in his inaugural  address (taxes, increase in the price of gasoline). The  principal reason for the economic crisis is the budget deficit,  which could reach from 5 to 8 percent of the gross domestic  product (from 350 billion to 560 billion pesos, respectively).    The feasibility of maintaining an accord on prices  (salaries,  exchange rates, and prices of goods and services), mentioned by  some members of the new government, seems unrealistic and  improbable, according to Garcia. [passage omitted]    The new government will apply the IVA [Value Added Tax],  although with another name, only to wholesalers and with a long  list of exemptions, which Garcia believes, could contribute to  higher levels of tax evasion. He warns of the grave error of  falling into the temptation of using funds from the sale of the  assets of privatized firms to cover the deficit.    The sale of shares in PDVSA [Venezuelan Petroleum, Inc.] to  pay off large amounts of the external debt is another  possibility, which would also reduce the pressure of interest  payments. Although this measure is impeccable from a financial  point of view, it would be dangerous if not accompanied by a  radical restructuring of government finances.    According to the IESA economist, the alternatives for  financing the deficit are very restricted, because Venezuela's  access to international financial markets is limited, especially  when the macroeconomic situation is not sustainable. Economic  instability would limit the funds that could be obtained from  the multilateral organizations if there is no clear intention  and specific plan to put government finances in order.    There are also serious restrictions on further increases in  the domestic debt (new issues of letters of credit in bolivares)  to finance part of the deficit, because it would mean  substantial increases in interest rates.

			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Observers held by Khmer Rouge SIX United Nations peacekeepers were being held hostage by Khmer Rouge guerrillas in Cambodia last night after more than 24 hours in captivity, the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac) announced. A further six UN staff were injured by landmine explosions yesterday and Lt-Col Thierry Monet, the French chief of Untac's military operations, was injured when the helicopter in which he was travelling was hit by gunfire. He was on his way to assist in negotiations over the fate of the six captives. The incidents were a further indication of the increasing tension in Cambodia. Untac is registering voters for elections in May next year without having succeeded in disarming the four main factions as originally planned. The Khmer Rouge is refusing to abide by a peace plan it signed 13 months ago in Paris and some of its guerrillas have been telling Cambodian villagers not to take part in the election. At the same time government forces and Khmer Rouge units are preparing to do battle as usual now that the rains have ended. The six men held by the Khmer Rouge were unarmed military and naval observers. They include three Britons, Lieutenant Scott Verney of the Royal Navy and army officers Captain Richard Williams and Lieutenant-Colonel Mark Walton. A New Zealander, a Petty Officer Oxenham, and two unidentified Filipinos are also being held. In London the Foreign Office condemned the attempt to undermine Untac's work in Cambodia and called for the immediate release of the six. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, contacted Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general. India, the current president of the UN Security Council, was expected to see the Cambodian representative at the UN. Carrying only walkie-talkies, the observers were investigating troop movements of Khmer Rouge and government forces from an inflatable boat on a river near Kompong Thom when they were apprehended at a Khmer Rouge checkpoint. Untac said it appeared the guerrilla commander suspected the observers of spying for the government. Untac officials said it appeared the six men did not have an interpreter with them. Untac, which said the men were unharmed when radio contact was last made in mid-afternoon, announced that it had asked a Khmer Rouge representative in Phnom Penh to accompany a UN team to the area to secure the release of the captives, but the Khmer Rouge had not been co-operative. 'We are at this stage gravely concerned,' said Mr Eric Falt, Untac spokesman. 'We have been unable to secure a NADK (Khmer Rouge) liaison officer to accompany us. This is very unfortunate and surprising.' He said of the six captives: 'They are being held hostage and they shouldn't be.' He declined to give details of negotiations which took place yesterday between Untac and the guerrillas. Britain said last night that the Untac chief liaison officer was on the way to the area to try to negotiate their release. It is the first time that any of the 16,000 UN military personnel in Cambodia have been held captive for any length of time. Khmer Rouge leaders have refused Untac forces access to the territory under their control, but in a highly mobile guerrilla war it is almost impossible to say where one faction's territory ends and another's begins. Two of the men injured in landmine blasts were Tunisian policemen whose vehicle ran over an anti-tank mine on a road near Siem Reap yesterday morning. Three Indonesian policemen and a Nepali were injured two hours later when their vehicle detonated another anti-tank mine in the same place. Untac personnel were then ordered to stay off the road until it had been cleared. One of the Tunisians has already had a leg amputated, and it is feared that one of the Indonesians will also lose a leg.</p>

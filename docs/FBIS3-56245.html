			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gennadiy Charodeyev: "Lithuanian Seimas </F> Chairman: Kaliningrad Does Not Belong to Russia"]    [Text] There are growing calls in the Lithuanian  parliament for the separation of Kaliningrad Oblast from the  Russian Federation and the formation of a new Baltic republic on  its territory.    In a joint statement, Seimas Chairman Ceslovas Jursenas and  Deputy Romualdas Ozolas demand the oblast's "demilitarization"  and "deoccupation," a review of its international status, and  the creation of a new state, integrated into the structure of  North Europe. Ozolas stated: "At the Potsdam Conference in  1945, the victorious countries entrusted the oblast's  administration to the USSR for a period of only 50 years."    The Potsdam Conference decision to transfer what is now  Kaliningrad Oblast to the Soviet Union was final, irrevocable,  and indefinite, which unequivocally follows from the text of the  relevant accord. The fact that territorially the oblast belongs  to the USSR, and correspondingly to Russia, was subsequently  enshrined in the Treaty on the Final Settlement Against Germany  of 12 September 1990 and the Treaty on Good-Neighborliness,  Partnership, and Cooperation Between the USSR and the FRG of 9  November 1990.    As regards the Russian military presence in the oblast, it  is  and will be determined exclusively by Russia's defense needs.    Do the Lithuanian deputies realize that their irresponsible  comments could complicate Lithuanian-Russian relations and that  they can only play into the hands of the notorious extremist  forces in Russia?</p>

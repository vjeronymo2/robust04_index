			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Abacha vows to end Nigerian military rule: Constitutional conference opens General Sani Abacha, Nigeria's head of state, opened the country's constitutional conference yesterday with a pledge to end military rule once his regime had found the structure for lasting democracy. He refused, however, to set a date for quitting office until after the four-month conference. Doubts remain whether the 360 delegates at the conference have the power to shape Nigeria's political future. Gen Abacha described his government's role in the conference as 'facilitators'. Mr Adolphus Kabiri-Whyte, the chairman of the delegates, took a more optimistic view of their powers at the opening session when he thanked Gen Abacha for giving them a free hand. . The outcome of the conference will be summarised in November in a report by a government-appointed commission which will be the basis of next year's political pro-gramme. Previous constitutional conferences in Nigeria have been the springboard for political parties and careers. The list of delegates of whom 90, including the conference chairman, are nominated by the government, contains many prominent figures from previous regimes. They include Mr Shehu Yar'Adua, a leading candidate for the presidency two years ago, former vice-president Mr Alex Ekwueme, and former leader of the rebel Biafran state, Mr Emeka Ojukwu. The most surprising come-back is by Mr Umaru Dikko, who returned from exile in Britain on Sunday. Mr Dikko is a former minister of transport, whom a past military regime tried to abduct from Britain for trial. Although he would not give a timetable, Gen Abacha was specific about ending military rule. 'We are aware that it is neither in our personal interest nor that of the nation to perpetuate ourselves in power. Nothing could be further from our plans.' It should be clear even to his detractors, said Gen Abacha, that 'once political parties begin to emerge from the first quarter of 1995, the next logical process would be activities leading to elections into the various tiers of governance which the constitutional conference will recommend'. Gen Abacha's speech seemed to rule out significant changes to the federal structure of Nigeria and made no reference to renewed protests over the annulment of the presidential election which was won by Mr Moshood Abiola last June. Mr Abiola has been in detention at an unknown location since last week following his demands that the military make way for him to become president.</p>

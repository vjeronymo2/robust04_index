			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Other big moves Furniture maker Silentnight was one of the main losers in the London market after issuing a profits warning at its annual meeting. The shares were off 34 and touched an 18-month low before rallying to finish 24 down at 219p. Disappointment over its half-year figures saw Quality Care, the nursing home group, drop 23 to 290p. Lamont Holdings, the textile group, lost 21 at 403p after it was announced that investment institution M&amp;G had sold 175,000 shares, reducing its stake to 3.9m, or 12.98 per cent.

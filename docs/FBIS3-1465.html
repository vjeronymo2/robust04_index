He said what had happened showed  how a small group of people could upset the entire peace  process. Dr. Gildenhuys also announced that the National Peace  Secretariat would meet in Durban tomorrow to discuss the  situation in Natal. A member of the secretariat, Mr. Rupert  Lorimer, said the events in Johannesburg were directly related  to the situation in Natal. He added that the peace structures  had not been officially informed of the march and only found out  about it yesterday. Mr. Lorimer confirmed receiving calls from  IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] members claiming they had received  reports that agent provocateur would be infiltrated into the  crowds to begin shooting and causing chaos.</p>

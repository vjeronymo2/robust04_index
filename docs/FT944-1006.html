			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Select Inds to acquire AirBoss Select Industries, the USM-traded company which, through a subsidiary, produces the AirBoss tyre for off-road vehicles, plans to acquire AirBoss Tyres of Australia, which holds a 50.4 per cent voting stake in Select. The deal will simplify the complex ownership structure of the various individual companies involved with the non-pneumatic tyre and the new company will be known as AirBoss Group. Perth-based AirBoss Tyres and its listed parent, AirBoss, own the right to the wheel system technology. AirBoss Ground Engagement, the Abingdon-based subsidiary of Select, has a licence to produce the tyre for Europe and some other markets. AirBoss said yesterday the existing structure did not provide a clear and unified corporate image to customers in the construction equipment industry. The refocusing, with operations merged into one company quoted in London and managed from the UK, was 'the next logical step' in the evolution of AirBoss and its technology.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yuriy Khnychkin and Yuriy Katsman: "The First </F> `Russian' Bank Opens in the United States: There Will Be Banks  for Russians in America and Europe"]    [Text] Today in many countries around the world one finds  "Arab," "Japanese" and "Chinese" banks -- i.e. financial  institutions that serve their own national clientele  exclusively. Soon Russian citizens will also have the chance to  make transactions on the international financial market through  "their" banks. Yesterday Washington was the site of a meeting of  a committee formed to establish a new international network of  banks to serve the needs of Russian entrepreneurs for  high-quality banking services abroad. There are plans to open  the first "Russian" bank in the United States this year.    The idea of establishing a network of "Russian" banks abroad  was put forward by Aleksandr Konanykhin, former president of the  All-Russian Exchange Bank, who has been in Washington since the  widely-publicized scandal that erupted within that bank's  highest-level administration the year before last. Taking part  in the project along with Mr. Konanykhin are the heads of a  number of Russian banks which have not yet been named publicly.  The founders refused the services of foreign investors who  offered to help finance the program.    On the whole, the idea of establishing a network of  "Russian"  banks abroad is quite justified. Many Russian entrepreneurs are  still unable to find a bank that suits them from the standpoints  of quality of service and reliability. For a number of reasons  (the unpredictable political situation, the high crime rate, and  a certain mistrust of banks) it has been extremely difficult to  find the desired combination of qualities in Russia. As for  foreign banks, they are clearly not eager to work with Russian  clients. Among the serious obstacles to the establishment of  stable partnerships between a Russian client and a foreign bank  are differences in business standards and the language barrier.  On the other hand, the return on deposits offered by foreign  banks (in the United States or Switzerland, for example) as a  rule does not exceed 4-6 percent annually. Furthermore, Russian  companies are often unable to manage their funds abroad  efficiently.    The new banking network, establishment of which will begin  with the United States, England and Switzerland, is intended to  solve precisely those problems. Firstly, even though a majority  of personnel at the new banks will presumably be comprised of  foreign specialists (who have a wealth of experience with  banking in their own countries), the personnel who work directly  with clients will know Russian. Secondly, Russian customers will  be able to able to manage funds on account with those banks  quickly and efficiently. The necessary instructions could be  given by phone, telex or fax, and in the entrepreneurs' native  language. Thirdly and finally, the new banks intend to offer  their customers a relatively high interest rate on accounts (of  course, not the same as in Russia -- 50-60 percent annually --  but at least two or three times higher than the world average).    As envisioned by the project's organizers, the operations of  "Russian" banks will involve not only depositing Russian  companies' fund and managing their assets, but also financing  foreign business transactions, participating in investment  projects and providing accounting services. Specifically, during  the first stage in the operations of the "Russian" bank in the  United States, according to Mr. Konanykhin everything possible  will be done to help attract Russian investment in the American  economy (ownership of property in the United States is one of  the essential conditions for obtaining a residence visa in that  country). True, at this point it is unclear how Russian monetary  oversight agencies will feel about the appearance of a new  channel for capital flight from Russia.</p>

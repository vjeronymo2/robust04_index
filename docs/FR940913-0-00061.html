			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OMB issued Circular A&hyph;110 in 1976 and made a minor revision in February 1987. To update the circular, OMB established an interagency task force to review the circular. The task force solicited suggestions for changes to the circular from university groups, non-profit organizations and other interested parties and compared, for consistency, the provisions of similar provisions applied to State and local governments. On August 27, 1992, OMB published a notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , at 57 FR 39018, requesting comments on proposed revisions to OMB Circular A&hyph;110. Interested parties were invited to submit comments. OMB received over 200 comments from Federal agencies, non-profit organizations, professional organizations and others. All comments were considered in developing the final revision. On November 29, 1993, at 58 FR 62992, OMB issued a revised circular which reflects the results of these efforts. This final rule represents HUD's adoption of the revised circular as part 84 of title 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations and sets forth the provisions and procedures HUD will follow in compliance with the uniform requirements set for Federal agencies in the newly revised OMB Circular A&hyph;110 regarding the administration of grants to and agreements with institutions of higher education, hospitals, commercial organizations and international organizations when operating domestically, and other non-profit organizations. If any statute specifically prescribes policies or specific requirements that differ from the standards provided herein, the provisions of the statute shall govern.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Recipients shall apply the provisions of this Circular to subrecipients performing substantive work under grants and agreements that are passed through or awarded by the primary recipient. This rule does not apply to grants, contracts, or other agreements between HUD and units of State or local governments covered by OMB Circular A&hyph;102, ``Administrative Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements to State, Local and Federally Recognized Indian Tribal Governments,'' as codified in 24 CFR part 85. In addition, subawards and contracts to State or local governments are not covered by this rule. However, this rule applies to subawards made by State and local governments to organizations covered by this rule. HUD shall apply the provisions of this part to commercial organizations and international organizations (when operating domestically).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The definition of ``award'' does not include technical assistance, which provides services instead of money; other assistance in the form of loans, loan guarantees, capital advances under the Sections 202 and 811 programs, interest subsidies, or insurance; direct payments of any kind to individuals; and, contracts which are required to be entered into and administered under procurement laws and regulations. Therefore, this rule does not apply to these types of activities. Consequently, this rule does not apply to any matter involving funds which would be covered by a regulatory agreement between a mortgagor and the Secretary, executed under Sections 201, 207(b), 232(d)(1), 242(d)(1), and 236 (including Rental Assistance Payments) of the National Housing Act; Section 101(a) of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965; and Section 201(a) of the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1978.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Other Matters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Justification for Interim and Final Rule <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department has determined that notice and public comment are unnecessary and contrary to the public interest before making this rule effective because the substance of the rule received public comment when the circular was published on August 27 1992. All comments received were reviewed and considered in the development of the revised circular. However, the Department will accept and review any comments received on subpart E because of the selective use of certain provisions as they apply to the use of lump sum grants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 on Regulatory Planning and review, issued by the President on September 30, 1993. Any changes made in the rule subsequent to its submission to OMB are identified in the docket file, which is available for public inspection with the Rules Docket Clerk, Room 10276, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW, Washington, DC 20410.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Review <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with HUD regulations at 24 CFR Part 50, which implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. The Finding of No Significant Impact is available for public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk, Office of the General Counsel, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Room 10276, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this rule before publication and by approving it certifies that this rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. It pertains only to the administration of grants and agreements with institutions of higher education, hospitals, and other non-profit organizations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: 'Green' measure of GDP propose - Environment A NEW way of measuring national income which takes better account of environmental factors - a 'green gross domestic product' - will be endorsed next week by the Liberal Democrats. Based on the idea of a 'sustainable net national income', it proposes that some environmentally undesirable activities should count as minuses in calculating gross domestic product (GDP), and that weight should be given to 'green' initiatives which are not included under the current measurements. The party believes that it would take about five years to set up the system, which could ultimately replace the existing one. The system derives from a report, to be published next week, by Mr Roefie Heuting, an environmental economist who advises the Dutch government. It addresses the point that while cleaning up pollution counts as economic activity and is thus included in the calculation of GDP, benefits from initiatives such as investment in energy efficiency and low-energy technology are not included. By becoming the first party to commit itself to developing these plans, the Liberal Democrats believe they can reinforce their high profile on environmental issues. Party officials believe there is some frustration among government environmental advisers that little or no progress has been made on work in this area, though there was some discussion of it when the white paper on the environment was published in 1990. Among the activities that the report proposes should be included in GDP calculations are afforestation, a shift away from air traffic to greater use of water and rail and the replacement of paper by electronic publication.</p>

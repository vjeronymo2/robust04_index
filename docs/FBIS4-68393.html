			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Natalya Kalashnikova: "Investment Cooperation </F> Between the Russian Federation and the United States: Americans  Want To Feel at Home in Russia"]    [Text] If you take into account that it is a  statutory requirement of the American Chamber of Commerce not  only to contribute to American business in Russia but also to  "provide for communication with the Russian Government,"  yesterday's meeting (and it takes place once a month) may be  considered to be program-defining. The board of directors  invited Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Shokhin to speak. The  meeting proceeded in the traditional American style: The  negotiating table doubled as a dinner table. True, after Mr.  Shokhin's 40-minute speech there were so many questions about  Russian investment legislation that the deputy prime minister  did [not] have a chance to "lunch."    The American Chamber of Commerce, which has been operating  in  Moscow only since January, has begun to work with a knowledge of  its task. Which is not surprising: Its board of directors  includes representatives of the largest companies--from  Coca-Cola to Caterpillar, from Johnson &amp; Johnson to General  Electric, from Philip Morris to Chase Manhattan. And the  communication with Mr. Shokhin shifted from problems of Russian  reforms and civil accord (he noted, in particular, that  parliament's readiness to reach agreement with the government  should be revealed as early as Friday--during the discussion of  the draft budget)--to questions related to business in Russia.  Here too, as the deputy prime minister noted, on the one hand,  Russia cannot use the old Soviet laws, and on the  other--business conditions cannot be changed frequently. In this  connection he recalled Boris Yeltsin's September edict which  introduced a three-year moratorium on changing legislation  regarding foreign firms operating in Russia. Other laws will  also have to wait their turn--in a couple of days the civil code  ("the most productive economic document") will be submitted to  the State Duma, and the government's immediate plans include  laws on the banking system and foreign investments. From the  podium of the American Chamber of Commerce the deputy prime  minister presented an initiative to introduce one more  moratorium. This time regarding state structures that handle  foreign investments and redistribution of duties among them: "Or  else we will all be 'improving' the structures but the investor,  in confusion, will not even know with whom he is dealing."    The questions from the businessmen showed one thing:  Americans, even those who have firmly set their feet on Russian  soil along with their capital, cannot understand precisely what  it is here that does not coincide with their native laws. For  example, why their commercial banks and insurance companies are  not given freedom in Russia. Mr. Shokhin had to explain that one  strong insurance firm from the United States is capable of  crowding out practically all similar Russian ones in a year. And  in response to the obvious desire to feel at home in Russia  (from the standpoint of laws) the businessmen had to hear many  reproaches against their own authorities as well. The laws of  the United States, according to Mr. Shokhin's estimate, contain  up to 260 discriminatory restrictions against Russia. Bill  Clinton promised to abolish them back in Vancouver. In Russia  they expected that this would be done by a single act  ("restrictions regarding the USSR do not apply to Russia"), but  "in Congress they decided to study each case individually."  One-third of them have been abolished, but the congressmen will  have to work another couple of years on the rest of them. So  Russian exporters to the United States will not soon feel that  they are equal either.    [First box, page 3]  <H5>  Some Information from U.S. Investment Legislation </H5>   --The United States does not require special permission or  preliminary registration of investment operations. The national  conditions envisioned for U.S. firms, as a rule, apply to joint  companies.    --Federal laws prohibit foreign investors from owning or  holding a controlling block of shares in corporations in the  spheres of television and radio broadcasting, telegraph, and  satellite communications systems, construction and operation of  nuclear power plants and pipelines, extraction of mineral  resources, and coastal or maritime shipping. Aid to foreign  investors at the federal level is most frequently granted in the  form of guaranteed loans.    --Supervision of the activity of foreign firms is provided  by  the Interdepartmental Committee on Foreign Investments  (consultative agency) which is answerable to Congress.  Monitoring of portfolio investments is the responsibility of the  Department of Finance.    --At the level of the states and local agencies the finance  department coordinates the activity of foreign capital and  leaves monitoring up to the states. A number of states have  programs for attracting investments and more than 20 have  missions in Europe. [end box]    [Second box, page 3]  <H5>  American Investments in Russia </H5>   There are 953 Russian-American joint ventures registered in  Russia and the proportion of American capital in them is 46.3  percent. Including in the sphere of new technologies and the  petroleum and gas complex--44 joint ventures. Moreover, 327  enterprises with a total authorized capital of $2.3 billion  belong completely to U.S. investors.    Some joint projects:    --The Kirov plant, Uralmash, and the ZIL Joint-Stock Company  are working with Caterpillar on the creation of a  machine-building product (electric generators for drills,  internal combustion engines, trucks, and prime movers)    --With IBM and American Airlines they are developing a  system  for control of airline shipments (it is to replace the currently  existing Sirena)    --The Mosmed Joint-Stock Company and Baxter--a joint venture  for producing surgical instruments    --The AKRIKhIN Joint-Stock Company (Russia) and  Bristol-Myers--production of cardiovascular medical preparations    --The Novomoskovsk Household Chemical Plant and Proctor  &amp;  Gamble--production of household chemicals and detergents.

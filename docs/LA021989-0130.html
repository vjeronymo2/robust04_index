			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JERRY HULSE'S TRAVEL TIPS  </P> <P> A note from Scott McTiernan of the little San Juan Guest Ranch in the Colorado  Rockies tells of summer plans. The season opens June 1 with a thrifty package  ($700) that includes a room in the ranch house, meals, a horse, sightseeing by  Jeep, fishing (McTiernan supplies poles, bait).  </P> <P> New in '89 will be two spring flower photo workshops (June 11-17 and June  18-24). Film is developed nightly with critiques by professional photographer  Chuck Dresner. Two "autumn colors" photo workshops are planned for Sept. 24-30,  Oct. 1-7. The price remains the same throughout the season, whether guests  attend the workshops or just ride, fish and sightsee (or else just laze in the  shade of the towering ponderosa pine outside the ranch).  </P> <P> The San Juan is next door to the village of Ouray (the "Switzerland of  America"). Meals served family-style. Morning and afternoon or all-day rides.  Jeep trips to ghost towns hidden in the San Juan Mountains. This is a small,  friendly ranch. Only 25 guests. Meadows reach out to the mountains. A white  rail fence, red barn. Dudes come all the way from Europe to saddle up at this  friendly little ranch.  </P> <P> Scott McTiernan, San Juan Guest Ranch, 2882 Highway 23, Ridgway, Colo. 81432.

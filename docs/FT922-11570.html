			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Incomes and output decline in Russia GRIM figures on Russia's living standards and industrial production were published by its state statistics committee yesterday, as medical staff and teachers began a wave of strikes. At the same time Mr Nursultan Nazarbayev, president of Kazakhstan and an enthusiastic supporter of the Commonwealth of Independent States, warned that the organisation was in danger. The lack of agreement between CIS members has aggravated the desperate economic plight of each - though no mechanisms for closer co-operation can be agreed. Mr Nazarbayev, speaking after a summit meeting of the Central Asian states in Kirghizia, gave two reasons for his concern: statements by the Ukrainian government after the CIS summit meeting in Kiev last month which suggested Ukraine might leave the grouping; and proceedings in the Russian Congress, where many deputies called the CIS unconstitutional and demanded the return of the Soviet Union. Mr Nazarbayev said the next CIS summit, on May 15, would be crucial. The Russian figures show that gross national product dropped by 14 per cent and output by 13 per cent in the first quarter compared with a year ago. Oil and gas production dropped by 15m tonnes, and coal by 1 per cent. More than 50m people, or one-third of the population, had incomes of Rbs900 or less in the first quarter. Rbs900 is the level of the new minimum wage which Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy prime minister, has promised to introduce by May 1. However, the statistics committee says that the monthly subsistence level now stands at Rbs1,200. Unemployment remains relatively low - up from 70,000 at the beginning of the year to 118,000 by the end of last month. But the combination of low wages and high prices is triggering more strikes. Stoppages lost the economy 260,000 work days in the first quarter.</p>

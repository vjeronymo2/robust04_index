			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Bond formally declared bankrupt: Order marks the end of entrepreneur's involvement in business MR ALAN BOND, the Australian entrepreneur whose flamboyant rise was matched only by his dramatic fall, was declared bankrupt yesterday after a legal battle lasting almost a year. The bankruptcy order marks the formal end of Mr Bond's involvement in business, but not the end of his career as a public figure, which is likely to last for at least another year. In addition to further bankruptcy hearings, he faces criminal charges in Perth, and is the subject of inquiries by the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) and a Royal Commission into alleged corruption in Western Australia. Mr Bond is also in early stages of divorce proceedings from his wife Eileen, which could become entangled with bankruptcy hearings into the disposal of his assets. Ironically, Mr Bond was not in the federal court in Sydney to hear Mr Justice Morling appoint Mr Robert Ramsay, a Western Australian accountant, as his trustee in bankruptcy. Mr Bond was giving evidence to the royal commission in Perth, which sat in secret to avoid compromising his trial on fraud charges, which is due to open on May 25. Mr Bond denies the charges. The judge's ruling followed a series of court hearings and appeals by Mr Bond against an earlier order that he was liable to pay a personal debt of USDollars 194m to to a banking syndicate led by the Hongkong Bank of Australia. The debt relates to personal guarantees given by Mr Bond against loans by the syndicate to Dallhold Investments, a private company controlled by the Bond family which has nickel mining interests. Justice Morling rejected arguments by Mr Bond's lawyers that an affidavit presented by the creditors was deficient, and that the hearing should be postponed for two weeks to allow him to take further legal advice. Mr Ramsay said he expected to meet Mr Bond shortly to demand a statement of his financial affairs and assets, confiscate his passport, and begin an examination of a group of family trusts. Mr Bond will have to ask Mr Ramsay's permission to travel abroad, own a car worth more than ADollars 2,500, or negotiate credit of more than ADollars 500. 'He would have to have a good reason to convince me that he should have his passport back,' Mr Ramsay said. Mr Bond resigned as chairman of Bond Corporation Holdings, his flagship listed company, in September 1990, two days before the group announced an Australian record loss of ADollars 2.24bn. Bond Corp is being restructured under a debt for equity swap which will transfer more than 90 per cent of the company's equity to its creditors, mostly European bondholders. Most of the company's assets have been sold. At his peak in the mid 1980s, Mr Bond was estimated by an Australian business magazine to be worth more than ADollars 100m. He won the America's Cup for Australia, and in 1987 was named Australian of the Year. His public displays of wealth were famous, and his life seemed divided between country estates in Britain and Australia, luxury yachts and intercontinental commuting by private aircraft. Bond Corp and a network of subsidiaries and associates controlled newspapers, television stations, and a number of major breweries, including G. Heilemann in the US and the Toohey's, Castlemaine XXXX and Swan brands in Australia. The group also built up significant shareholdings in a range of overseas companies, including Allied Lyons, the diversified UK food and drink group; TV-am, the UK television station; M &amp; G, Britain's biggest unit trust, and Airship Industries. The end came after a risky foray against Lonrho, the diversified UK group managed by Mr Roland 'Tiny' Rowland, provoked a document identifying numerous financial weaknesses in Bond Corp's structure. Mr Bond's remaining assets are unclear. He told a court last September that he had little left apart from ADollars 50,000 in three bank accounts. Some personal assets such as furniture are believed to have been disposed of since then.</p>

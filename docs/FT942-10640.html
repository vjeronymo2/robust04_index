			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Eurostar tunnel trains delayed It could be nine to 12 months before a full service of Euro-star trains is running through the Channel tunnel from London to Paris and Brussels, says European Passenger Services, operator of the trains, Charles Batchelor writes. The service is expected to start with just two trains a day to each destination, rising to 15 a day. Delays in deliveries and the time taken to test each train will mean there will be a gradual build-up of services from July or August. The 400-metre trains will take three hours at speeds of up to 186mph to travel between London and Paris and three hours 15 minutes between London and Brussels. Ticket prices will be announced three weeks before the start of the service. First-class fares are expected to be slightly lower than airlines' premium rates and there will be discount fares for leisure travellers.</p>

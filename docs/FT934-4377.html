			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Survey of Japanese Industry (11): Powerful competitive position - Profile / Yamazaki Mazak Japan's big machine tool producers - Yamazaki Mazak, Amada, Toyoda, Okuma, Hitachi Seiki - are rightly seen by European and US rivals as formidable worldwide competitors, but not even they have remained immune from the industry's global recession. The Japanese industry is the largest in the world, accounting for about a quarter of total machine tool production worth Dollars 34.6bn last year, according to statistics from American Machinist. But consumption of machine tools in Japan, which was also the world's largest market, fell 32 per cent to Dollars 5.7bn last year, says the magazine. Last month, the Japan Machine Tool Builders Association said orders received by the Japanese producers this year were likely to fall short of Y600bn for the first time since 1983. Total orders last year were Y710.2bn, down 37 per cent from 1991 and only just over half the Y1,412.1bn achieved in the boom year of 1990. And the recession is still continuing - machine tool orders in September were down 31.5 per cent from a year earlier at Y42.3bn due to weak private sector demand amid continued economic stagnation, the association said. Mr Teruyuki Yamazaki, chairman and president of privately-held Yamazaki Mazak, points out that in some respects, Japanese producers are suffering in the same way as their German counterparts. 'For the machine tool industry in Europe, volumes are about 50 per cent down, compared with the peak time (two to three years ago),' he says. 'Japan has seen about the same fall.' Up to a point, there are similarities in the longer-term structural changes going on in both the German and Japanese domestic markets for machine tools. In Japan, one of the reasons for the rapid fall in demand for machine tools has been the excess capacity in the automotive and other industries built in the expectation that growth rates in domestic sales and exports would continue. As in Germany, the high costs of domestic manufacturing are encouraging the machine tool industry's customers to move manufacturing, or at least the supply of components, overseas. Investments by the Japanese automotive industry in the US and the UK represent machine tool orders that might once have been domestic business but are now either export orders or supplied by Japanese or rival machine tool builders manufacturing elsewhere. It is in the export business that Mr Yamazaki sees further similarities between the Japanese industry's predicament and that of the German industry. 'Japanese exporters are facing heavy competition in the European market because the yen is too strong,' he says. This is a disadvantage for Yamazaki in respect of the machines it exports from Japan, but Mr Yamazaki notes that German producers are facing similar problems exporting to countries with weak currencies. Some might argue that the key difference between the two leading machine tool producing countries is that the Japanese have a much tighter grip on their home market where imports accounted for 10 per cent of consumption last year, compared with 36 per cent in Germany. But while many believe that the present recession has seriously weakened the European machine tool industry's competitiveness vis-a-vis its Japanese rivals, Mr Yamazaki does not believe this is the case. 'In Germany the machine tool industry has suffered, and so have we, so the competitive balance has not changed much.' In spite of the global recession, the strong yen, and the more fundamental changes in the Japanese market, though, Yamazaki Mazak is in a powerful position competitively, when compared not only with non-Japanese producers but also with domestic rivals. With overseas manufacturing at Florence in Kentucky, Worcester in the UK, Les Ulis in France, and Singapore its production base is more international than is the case generally in the machine tool industry. The Worcester plant began producing machine tools in 1987 and was intended mainly as a manufacturing base for Europe. It was then considered that the investment would foreshadow many more by Japanese producers in Europe - 'We were a step ahead,' says Mr Yamazaki. That this has not happened is due partly to recent market conditions. But Mr Yamazaki believes it has also been much more difficult for the Japanese producers to invest in one European country than in the US, because of the many different cultures, markets, languages and tax systems in Europe. 'Some of the Japanese wanted to invest in Europe, but they could not do it,' he says. The Worcester plant, along with other UK-based machine tool producers, has seen its home market hit by the recession - first in the UK and then in continental Europe. But lower costs and the recent devaluation of sterling mean that, according to Mr Yamazaki, 'we have good competitiveness from our UK machines.' The company is now expanding exports from the Worcester plant to markets outside Europe, and is also gradually increasing the number of machine tool types made there. No one in the machine tool industry is predicting a return to the heady days of 1990, when sales were being buoyed by factors such as the 'bubble economy' in Japan. But Mr Yamazaki is confident about the long-term need for machine tools, especially in Europe and the US. 'If you look at European and US customers of the machine tool industry,' he says, 'you will see that many of their production facilities are older than those used in Japan. So these customers will have to make more investment in equipment.' He is also keeping a close eye on Asia, where cheap labour and booming markets have encouraged many traditional Yamazaki customers to begin manufacturing. Machine tool producers such as Yamazaki are following their customers into Asia, but also want to be there to take advantage of the region's overall market opportunities. The company began producing machine tool parts in Singapore last year, and also has a technical co-operation agreement with a Chinese machine tool builder, Shenyang No 1 Machine Tool Works. This is not yet a joint venture, but Mr Yamazaki says the co-operation has good potential for further development.</p>

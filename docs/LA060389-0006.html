			<p><P> June 3, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOS ANGELES TEACHERS' STRIKE SETTLEMENT  </P> <P> This strike has been an education in the truest sense of the word. However,  this one had little to do with books and pencils.  </P> <P> As educators we have precious little time to spend with one another but we  won't soon forget one memorable exception. Those of us on strike from my school  went to breakfast one morning after picketing to assess how we were holding up  as a group. At that time we each shared our feelings about continuing our  resolve to stay on strike and the discussion started to grow into something  else.  </P> <P> Our sharings made me truly proud to be in this beleaguered profession. We spoke  about ours being one of the most important jobs on the planet. We spoke of  being separated from those little faces that came to the fence every day and we  were grieving. There was a growing awareness of real professional pride among  us.  </P> <P> Something happened that morning and the strike had actually brought us a gift.  We can now go back to our school knowing we bring with us pride, a sense of  trust and dignity. At the ratification rally I felt all teachers in Los Angeles  had gained this and no one can take that away from us now.  </P> <P> PAT TOBIAS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

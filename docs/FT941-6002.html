			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / International Company News: Banks meet to finalise Euro Disney strategies Euro Disney's creditor banks met in Paris yesterday to discuss their negotiating tactics ahead of tomorrow's formal meeting with the troubled leisure group, and Walt Disney, its US parent company. Members of the steering committee representing the banks in talks over Euro Disney's proposed financial rescue have been meeting informally for the past 10 days with representatives of the Disney camp. These meetings began after the publication on Monday last week of an audit of Euro Disney's finances commissioned by the banks from KPMG Peat Marwick. Tomorrow's meeting will be the first formal negotiating session between the 63 international banks in the Euro Disney loan syndicates and the Disney companies since the completion of the audit. Euro Disney is being advised in the negotiations by S. G. Warburg in London, and Walt Disney by Lazard Freres in New York. The steering committee, led by Banque Nationale de Paris and Banque Indosuez, has already told the Disney companies it envisaged the final restructuring package being worth between FFr12bn and FFr13bn (Dollars 2.2bn). Walt Disney would share the burden of the restructuring equally with the banks. However some of the smaller banks in the syndicates (which are not represented on the steering committee) are anxious for Disney to play a larger part. A number of these smaller lenders yesterday called on the committee to consult them more closely on negotiating tactics. The banks plan at tomorrow's meeting to discuss ways in which Disney can participate in the restructuring. They will propose that Disney should significantly reduce its entitlement to various contractual payments from Euro Disney, to alleviate the financial burden on the company. These payments include the US group's entitlement to royalty income from the EuroDisneyland theme park, a management fee on sales and a performance-related incentive fee.</p>

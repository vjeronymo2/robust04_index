			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / UK Company News: TR Pacific net assets rise STRONG performances by south-east Asian stock markets, particularly Hong Kong and Indonesia, contributed to a rise of 23.6 per cent in net asset value at TR Pacific Investment Trust over the six months to June 30. The figure of 141.7p compared with 114.63p in December and 95.3p a year earlier. Net revenue improved to Pounds 370,000 (Pounds 328,000) for earnings of 0.552p (0.49p) per share. Plans to raise further equity finance have been under consideration since the beginning of July, but directors said they were not proceeding immediately. The proposals will be kept under review. The trust continues to be optimistic on the region's growth prospects. The overheating economy in China may have a temporarily adverse effect on sentiment, but directors see a good outlook for longer term investment.</p>

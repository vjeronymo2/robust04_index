			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Ambassador Mahmud Abu-al-Nasr, the </F> Arab League's delegate at the United Nations, in New York, by  Ashraf 'Abd-al-'Aziz, in Cairo; date not given; from the  "Dialogue From Afar" program -- recorded]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] ['Abd-al-'Aziz] In front of me  is a statement by Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat  'Abd-al-Majid saying that the League has exhausted its efforts  to resolve the Yemeni crisis and end the current fighting  between the Yemeni people. He also said the Yemeni crisis has  been internationalized by the Security Council's intervention.  Should we consider this to be a real failure by the Arab League  to intervene in the crisis?    [Abu-al-Nasr] I do not want to say the situation is a  failure  or success, because the efforts are continuing. The Arab League  and the United Nations have tried. This does not mean the two  organizations have failed to achieve a cease-fire or that the  door has been closed to future attempts by the Arab league or  the United Nations. These efforts are continuing and  cooperation with the Arab League is also continuing. There are  constant consultations between the UN and Arab League  secretaries general to reach a solution. I do not want to get  into the issue of internationalizing the problem because what  concerns us now is stopping this tragedy and the Yemeni people's  suffering.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Should we expect a new intervention by the  Arab League?    [Abu-al-Nasr] If the two parties agree. The issue is now  being raised at the Security Council and undoubtedly the Arab  League will cooperate with the Council to urge the parties to  comply with the resolutions passed in this regard.

			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> CHEWING KHAT A COMMON BOND IN YEMEN  </P> <P> Down a dusty alley of the old city's ramshackle bazaar, behind huge mounds of  sultanas, coffee and spices that have been marketed here for more than three  millennia, a young vendor named Ahmed invited a curious visitor to join him and  his neighbors in an afternoon ritual enigmatically described as the key to  Yemeni democracy.  </P> <P> The men stretched languidly on mats spread around the floor and began munching  green leaves plucked from bundles of small branches. Each of them would slowly  build up a wad of moist leaves in his cheek, sucking the juice through the  mucous membranes. The bitter, astringent taste was soon forgotten as  conversation became more animated, ranging over diverse issues such as bread  and fuel prices, the revolutionary changes in the role of women, Iraq's  President Saddam Hussein and the risks of war in the Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> Each afternoon, life in Yemen comes to a virtual standstill for three or four  hours as this scene unfolds in countless shops and salons around the country.  Chewing khat (pronounced "gut") -- the mildly narcotic leaf that packs a  stimulant punch equal to a double espresso -- is more than the national  pastime. It functions as a basic forum of social intercourse where business  deals are consummated, marriages are brokered and political bonds are sealed.  In Western terms, the khat chew fulfills all of the purposes served by the  power lunch, the kaffeeklatsch and the cocktail hour.  </P> <P> In this rugged land of almost incessant tribal warfare, the khat chew helps  hold a violent society together. Blood feuds -- perpetuated when assassinations  are habitually revenged by killing kinsmen of the murderer -- are rarely  settled unless money changes hands and khat is chewed.  </P> <P> In a country where most men proudly flaunt curved daggers in their belts or  Kalashnikov assault rifles on their shoulders, the bitter green leaf's  universal popularity represents a unique common bond, helping sustain tenuous  truces that have preoccupied President Ali Abdullah Saleh during much of his 12  years in power.  </P> <P> When North and South Yemen merged into one nation last May, Saleh vowed to  promote a democratic society through free speech and free elections. Successful  experiments in democracy are rare in the Arab world, but Yemeni officials  believe that their effort will be aided by the national habit of munching those  green leaves.  </P> <P> "The khat chew, in a way, is like a little parliament," explained Abdel Malik  Sindi, an Information Ministry official. "You can find government ministers  sitting together with laborers, discussing big problems and small, irrespective  of social status. Besides, many poorer people usually know where to find the  best khat."  </P> <P> In some households more than half the monthly income is spent on khat. Children  have been known to go hungry so a father can maintain respect and admiration  among his peers by sharing the finest-quality khat at an afternoon chew. As a  luxury crop, khat has acquired not only high economic value but great social  prestige for its cultivators.  </P> <P> Production has more than doubled in the last two decades, displacing grain and  the famed Mocha coffee because of its lucrative value.  </P> <P> Khat connoisseurs estimate that there are 80 varieties, with different tastes,  strengths and sensations. "It can be as complex as wine, and people will go to  great lengths to find choice branches from a particular part of the valley,"  said Eric Watkins, a British journalist and academic researcher based in Sanaa  who has traveled widely throughout Yemen sampling different kinds of khat.  </P> <P> Some Yemenis swear that khat has important medicinal value, particularly in  controlling diabetes. A popular rumor among returning Yemeni laborers who  worked for years in neighboring Saudi Arabia is that the portly King Fahd has  taken up khat chewing to control diabetes, curb his appetite and reduce his  weight. But doctors in Yemen warn that too much consumption can cause heart  palpitations and, ultimately, cancer of the esophagus if wads of khat are  swallowed too frequently.  </P></p>

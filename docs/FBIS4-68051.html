We draw your attention to  his report: [passage omitted]    On the futue of the intifadah after implementation of the  Gaza-Jericho accord, Shaqaqi said: Far from being curtailed,  the military operation will -- in my opinion -- intensify, even  though continuation of the military operations under these  circumstances will be difficult. We will, however, exert every  effort.</p>

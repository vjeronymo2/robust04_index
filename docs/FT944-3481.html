			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Observer: Give your all Short of ideas for this season's perfect gift? The Christmas catalogue from Dallas-based retailer Neiman-Marcus can perhaps retrieve the situation. How about an electric gondola for a swing round the nearest canal? The modest Dollars 7,400 price-tag includes a removable cassette player, ice bucket and an emergency paddle. Or there's the scaled-down but live three-foot-high donkey - to which the retailer attributes an 'affectionate nature' - at anything between Dollars 1,300 and Dollars 9,000, depending on sex and pedigree. Perhaps the 300-gallon elephant-shaped aquarium for Dollars 120,000 grabs your fancy. Just perfect for an elephant-shaped fish.</p>

			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> 2ND SUCCESS IN TRIDENT 2 TEST  </P> <P> A Navy submarine successfully launched a Trident 2 missile today without  interference from Greenpeace anti-nuclear protesters who had threatened to  enter the safety zone, the Navy said.  </P> <P> The launch from the submerged nuclear submarine Tennessee was the second  straight successful undersea firing of the Navy's newest and deadliest nuclear  weapon. Two of the first three submarine tests failed explosively.  </P> <P> A 60-foot Greenpeace ketch, the Mondeivitano, was on the scene but did not  attempt to enter a safety zone after the Navy warned it to keep away, the Navy  said. On Dec. 4, a Navy ship damaged a Greenpeace vessel with 25 protesters  aboard by bumping it and using fire hoses to pour water down the smokestacks,  stopping the engines.  </P></p>

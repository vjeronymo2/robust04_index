			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 8 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- UN Representative  Jean Arnault said here that the Guatemalan Government and  guerrillas today ended a new round of talks without reaching  definite agreements, but after achieving significant headway.  In a news conference the UN representative announced that the  next round of talks is slated for 23-27 March in Mexico City.    He explained that the two topics discussed in this round  were  the approval of the negotiations calendar on pending topics from  the general agenda and the topic of human rights. Arnault also  remarked that it was not possible to complete the topics in  these negotiations in view that by consensus all sides agreed  that a new round of talks was necessary.    The government representatives and the Guatemalan National  Revolutionary Unity (URNG) leadership had planned to complete  talks by Monday -- talks which seek an end to the war that has  afflicted Guatemala for more than 30 years.</p>

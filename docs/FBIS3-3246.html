Economics Professor Dong Fureng said the new reform measures  mean a major readjustment of interest relations of all social  sectors.    "Reform in the new phase is so extensive that it can be  described as `touch of a single hair will give a jolt to the  whole body'," he said.    Professor Wu Jinglian described the new reform measures as  signaling the start of a "storming heavily-fortified positions"  phase for China's reform program.    Since the early 1980s, he said, China's economic reform has  gone through "rapids and shoals." The country's economic system  has finally come on the track of a market economy after  different steps of transition, from central planning, to central  planning supplemented by market regulations, to "a planned  commodity economy," he said.    Statistics show that prices of 90 percent of consumer goods  and 85 percent of capital goods are now regulated by the market;  and the value of products unregulated by state mandatory plans  account for over 95 percent of the national industrial output,  he said.    Scholars attending the sessions agree that reforms in the  past decade have accumulated precious experience and achieved  great successes.    However, limited progress has been made in the reform of  such  difficult areas as banking, finance, taxation, foreign exchange,  investment and enterprise system. If nothing is done for these  areas, they said, China's economy would face the double ills of  hyerflation and stagnation for a long time to come.    Facing challenges and opportunities, the government has  started all-round reforms, which have won support from the  public, they said.    Since China instituted a single exchange rate, a new  taxation  system and other reform measures from the beginning of this  year, Wu Jinglian said, the economy has maintained a relatively  high growth rate and the market shown a stable trend.    Reform of banking, finance, investment and foreign trade  sectors as well as state-owned enterprises is proceeding  healthily, he said.    Professor Wang Jue believed that the new reform measures  will  result in a prototype of a new system by the end of this year,  the public will become familiar with them next year and a  framework of the new system will come into being in three years.  "By the year 2000, China's economy will `dock' with the  international market," he said.    However, some economists have worries over the current  reforms. An economist with a Ph.D. said that the real test will  come in the second half of 1994 when all reform measures are  implemented and economic growth approaches the zenith of the  current cycle.    Monetary experts said that real threat comes from inflation,  because a considerable number of the Chinese people have a  limited tolerance for price hikes.    For Economics Professor Li Yining, the main problem is  unemployment. "In terms of economics, inflation is not a serious  question as long as it is lower or equal to economic growth," he  said. "But high unemployment may trigger social instability."    Another economist said success of the ongoing reforms hinges  on the performances of governments at all levels, which are  targets of the reforms as well as their designers, executors and  organizers.</p>

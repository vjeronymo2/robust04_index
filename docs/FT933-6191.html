			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Bottomley warns troubled hospitals to cuts costs MRS VIRGINIA BOTTOMLEY, the health secretary, yesterday warned two London hospitals to cut costs after they ran into funding difficulties just five months into the financial year. The Department of Health last night confirmed that four other hospitals in the capital - the Royal London, the Royal Orthopaedic, the Royal Ear Nose and Throat and the Havering - have been asked to cut back on some non-urgent operations. Mrs Bottomley's warning to University College Hospital - one of the capital's biggest teaching hospitals - and Middlesex Hospital underlined the government's intention to take a firm stand against inner-city hospitals which fail to bring their spending into line with contractual obligations. UCH and Middlesex Hospital, both part of the UCL Trust, have been forced to stop carrying out routine operations after exceeding targets imposed by Camden and Islington Health Authority. The hospitals had treated 500 patients too many, putting them 21 per cent over budget by the end of June. Ms Alyson MacRae, the health authority manager, said the hospitals had over-performed on their Pounds 26m contract. She said: 'If they were allowed to treat everyone on the waiting list as they wanted to, the contract would be used up, leaving no more funds for the urgent cases. We took this action so that they did not treat too many people on the waiting list too fast.' The authority had no contingency or reserve funds for hospitals that exceeded their contracts. The health authority said that it was monitoring non-urgent cases 'very closely' at St Bartholomew's Hospital with which it also has a contract. Individual cases were being referred to the authority for approval. UCH, like many of the large inner-city teaching hospitals, has seen demand for its services dwindle as shire health authorities, which used to refer patients, started to use local hospitals under the contracting system. A spokesman for UCH and Middlesex Hospital admitted that management might not have faced up to financial pressures quickly enough. He said the hospitals had known that the contract could not cover the expected number of patients based on previous years, but managers had hoped that more money could be made available. The hospitals now plan to shed between 20 and 30 consultants' posts and up to 40 non-medical staff as part of a cost-cutting exercise designed to save Pounds 10m this year, he said. Ms MacRae said: 'They have not responded quickly to the market situation.' The authority had no contingency or reserve funds for hospitals that exceeded their contracts. Mrs Bottomley said costs of treatment at the hospitals were high compared with The Royal Free or St. Mary's, two other London hospitals. 'For every two patients treated at UCH and Middlesex and Bart's more than three could be treated at the other hospitals.' Mr Geoff Martin, campaigns director of London Health Emergency, a pressure group backed by Labour-controlled local authorities, warned that similar cuts could happen elsewhere in London and in other large urban areas. He said: 'We know of other health authorities in London with similar financial problems. We are in a situation where before Christmas we could have a blanket ban on non-emergency operations across the whole of inner London.'</p>

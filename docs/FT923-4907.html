			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Ukraine military step in MILITARY air traffic controllers yesterday prepared to take over Ukrainian airports as an indefinite general strike paralysed the country for a second day. The Ukrainian government refused to bow to strikers' pay demands and sought a court order to force them back to work. The strike was called by the Council of Free Trade Unions, once the official trade union under communism. Strikers have closed most airports and train stations, stranding thousands, including a delegation from the International Monetary Fund. Support was weaker in the mining region of eastern Ukraine. Most politicians back government efforts to stop the wage and price rise spiral.</p>

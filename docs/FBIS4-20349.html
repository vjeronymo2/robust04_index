			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Xiao Yang (5135 4441), governor of Sichuan, </F> by QIUSHI reporter Zhang Sufang (1728 4790 5364) and SICHUAN  JINGJI RIBAO reporter Xiao Baoguo (5135 0202 0948); date and  place of interview not given: "Use Regional Approach To Develop  Sichuan Economy"]    [Text] Long celebrated as the "land of abundance," Sichuan  Province is China's most populous province whose reform and open  policy, economic development, and degree of social progress have  a profound impact on all China. The deepening of economic  structural reform, the steady expansion of the open policy, and,  in particular, the CPC Central Committee's call for the creation  of a socialist market economy have all given the landlocked  province of Sichuan a historic opportunity to develop its  economy. Its success has been enormous. However, Sichuan is  still some distance behind the provinces along the southeastern  coast. How to accelerate Sichuan's economic development? The  reporters posed this question to Comrade Xiao Yang, governor of  Sichuan, during an interview.    [QIUSHI] There is a famous couplet written on scrolls and  hung on the pillars of Wuhou Temple in Chengdu. The second line  reads, "When one fails to size up the situation, one will err by  being either too lenient or too strict." This shows the vital  importance of judging the hour and sizing up the situation.  Governor Xiao Yang, what can you tell us about Sichuan's  economic development strategy in the new era?    [Xiao Yang] As a local government, the principal mission of  the Sichuan government is to implement and carry through with  the CPC Central Committee's line and policies and come up with  specific policies in light of the reality. Agriculture is the  foundation of the national economy and rural stability is the  cornerstone of social stability overall. With its 90 million  peasants, Sichuan is a leading agricultural province. It is  imperative that in economic construction the basic position of  agriculture be strengthened and consolidated. Accordingly  Sichuan must make agriculture its top economic priority at all  times. In Sichuan, agriculture is highly developed and rests on  a firm foundation. While Sichuan accounts for one-sixteenth of  the nation's arable land, it feeds one-tenth of its population.  Its per capita grain consumption is 800 jin. Be that as it may,  there is still widespread rural poverty here and a vast majority  of the localities have not achieved a moderately comfortable  standard of living. A basic task of economic construction in  Sichuan, therefore, is to enable its 90 million peasants to  achieve just such a standard of living. Failing that, we cannot  say Sichuan has a decent standard of living. Accordingly,  developing an agriculture that is "high-quality, high-output,  and high-profit" and achieving rural industrialization will  decide whether or not Sichuan will attain a comfortable standard  of living by the end of this century.    Given the reality in rural Sichuan today, we must pay  special  attention to the adjustment of the mix of agricultural products.  We must work hard to increase the output of both agricultural  byproducts and cash crops to meet market demand and enhance  peasants' incomes. At the same time, we must tackle farmland  capital construction with urgency, building and maintaining  irrigation works and practicing water and soil conservation and  soil improvement, thus raising the productive capacity of  agriculture.    The fundamental way to develop the rural economy is  industrialization. Traditional agriculture may meet the  peasants' basic need for food and clothing, but it cannot bring  about a comfortable standard of living. To achieve that  objective calls for a mighty effort to develop township and town  enterprises. Hence our decision to give the development of  township and town enterprises a prominent place in the economic  development plan of the entire province, making it a strategic  focus of the drive to revitalize the rural economy, accelerate  economic development, and enhance the province's overall  strength. The development of township and town enterprises  mainly involves using agricultural resources as the base and  utilizing what is available locally. That means taking  agricultural byproducts such as grain and pork, which the  province turns out in large quantities, and putting them through  multiple processing. These days, for instance, over 60 million  pigs are slaughtered province-wide each year, giving rise to two  major industries, the multiple processing of pork and pigskin.  Not only are counties and regions along the Chengdu-Chongqing  railroad well-equipped in these trades, but even the counties in  the hill country and mountains surrounding the basin have  considerable development potential as well. Accordingly we have  set a goal of more than 50 billion yuan for the increase in  output value by township and town enterprises each year for the  next several years. If that comes to pass, township and town  enterprises will have an annual output value of about 250  billion yuan by 1995, making Sichuan much stronger economically  and bringing the achievement of a comfortable standard of living  closer to reality. Meanwhile, by placing new demands on  infrastructural development, the substantial development of  township and town enterprises is bound to greatly fuel the  development of related industries and facilitate the  modernization of the countryside over time.    Not only is Sichuan a large province, but it is also a  multi-nationality province with enormous inter-regional  differences. Of its population of 110 million, 7 million are  members of 55 minority nationalities. Geographically, Sichuan  includes both impoverished hill country and primitive mountain  areas as well as fertile plains. A mix of plains, grassland,  plateau, hills, mountains, and big rivers gives Sichuan a  complex geographical milieu. In terms of climate, it includes  both subtropical areas with their distinctive four seasons and a  frigid zone covered with snow year round. Turning to economic  and social development, it boasts a developed region centered on  Chengdu and Chongqing as well as minority-inhabited areas such  as Liangshan, Ganzi, and Aba, which are relatively backward both  economically and culturally, not to mention the old liberated  areas, minority areas, border regions, and impoverished areas.  Per capita annual income exceeds 400 yuan in the affluent areas  but ranges from 200 to 300 yuan in the impoverished mountain  areas. Take Liangshan Prefecture, for example. The outskirts of  Xichang Shi has a high-tech corps capable of putting a satellite  into space, yet many illiterates and semi-illiterates can be  found around the launching center. Some areas still languish in  the era of the matrilineal society with its slash-and-burn  culture. In a province like Sichuan, populous, vast in size,  home to multiple nationalities, and featuring distinct regional  characteristics and significant disparities in the level of  economic and social development from region to region, we cannot  practice subjectivism or over-simplify things by trying to  impose a uniform policy across the board as we make economic  policies. Instead, we must liberate our thinking and truly  proceed from reality so that our ideas are in line with the  objective world. Only by conducting in-depth studies and clearly  understanding the situation can we work out a plan that is right  for each locality.    [QIUSHI] After obtaining a comprehensive understanding of  the  situation in Sichuan, how did you go about formulating a  regional economic development strategy?    [Xiao Yang] Sichuan is called Sichuan because there are four  rivers in the province. Social and economic development takes  place along the rivers. Sichuan is actually a riverine economy.  In building a socialist market economy, we try to exploit the  resources of all areas fully and go all out to develop commodity  production and commodity circulation by putting industrial  advantage to work so as to spur social economic development.  When we talk about regional economies, we refer to, first of  all, the three-gorge economic region in eastern Sichuan,  including the Chang Jiang basin downstream from Chongqing. Next  is the Panxi economic region in southern Sichuan, specifically  the region upstream from Chongqing all the way to Yibin. The  third economic region is the western Sichuan economic region.  The fourth, the minority nationality economic region, including  Aba and Ganzi, among other places. By developing Sichuan's  economy based on these four economic regions, we can work out a  policy appropriate to the realities in each region and give them  a substantial measure of balanced power so that each region can  maintain its relative independence. The idea is to have the  various regions develop jointly on a basis of equality and  mutual benefit, exploiting their strengths but downplaying their  weaknesses. By offsetting one another's weaknesses, the regions  can promote economic development province-wide.    [QIUSHI] How will the various economic regions bring out  their own strengths?    [Xiao Yang] Besides doing a good job in infrastructural  construction, including energy, transportation, and  communications, the regions must start out by furthering their  mainstay industries by taking advantage of their existing  strengths. Mainstay industries should be the locomotive that  will drive the development of related industries and the  tertiary sector. The result should be a sound industrial  structure dominated by the mainstay industries where related  industries and the tertiary sector also have their proper place.  Take the three-gorge economic region of eastern Sichuan, for  example. Centered on Chongqing, this economic region features  such mainstay industries as metallurgy, machinery, automobile,  petroleum, and chemical industry. Right now, Sichuan is  dependent on finished petroleum products shipped into the  province from outside. That will not do in the long haul. We  must start with the oil refining industry. Ship crude oil into  Sichuan on Chang Jiang for processing here. That way we can  develop the province's oil refining industry and chemical raw  materials industry. The Panxi economic region in southern  Sichuan includes such localities as Panzihua, Luzhou, Yibin, and  Zigong. Here the mainstay industries are metallurgy, natural  gas, and chemical industry. The rare metals processing industry  should also be developed. The western Sichuan economic region is  based on Chengdu and has these mainstay industries: electronics,  automobile, and heavy machinery and equipment. With its  considerable strength in these industries, this economic region  is capable of rapid development too. Given their ample reserves  of lignite, places like Aba and Ganzi in the  minority-nationality economic region are in a position to  develop the coal-mining industry and coal chemical industry. By  accelerating the exploitation of such resources as minerals,  hydropower, electric power, Chinese medicinal materials, and  tourism, the minority economic region should develop pasture  land properly and improve forage grass and livestock breeds in  order to develop livestock husbandry. Meanwhile, the development  of the transportation system in minority areas should be  accelerated and enterprises that handle minority trade must be  given aid so that they are properly run and minority areas  gradually embark on the road to prosperity.    [QIUSHI] How should we solve problems relating to the  industrial structure and investment funds in order to build up  our mainstay industries as the engine that would drive economic  growth in all regions?    [Xiao Yang] If we are to grasp the opportunity and build up  our mainstay industries, we must expand their scale, upgrade  them, and raise their standard. Take pains to optimize the  industrial structure and product mix. Avoid thoughtless  investment and project duplication and really bring about an  essentially export-oriented strategic economic pattern with a  comprehensive infrastructure and a rational industrial  structure. Toward that end, we must continue to deepen reform;  transform the operating mechanism of state enterprises;  establish and nurture an open, unified, and orderly market  system; overhaul government functions; create and strengthen the  macroeconomic regulatory and control system; and speed up the  development of mainstay industries and the adjustment and  optimization of the industrial structure.    The biggest problem right now is a shortage of funds. And  there is only one way to solve it: self-accumulation and opening  the province to the outside world across the board. As far as  Sichuan is concerned, the strategy of all-round openness  involves heading to the east, to the south, and to the north at  the same time; combining the utilization of foreign capital with  foreign trade and the development of foreign economic relations;  and taking advantage of the opening of the coast to tap the  international market. "Heading to the east" means taking  advantage of the opening of the ports along the Chang Jiang to  act in concert with the development of Pudong in Shanghai. It  also means opening Sichuan to cities on the eastern coast  connected to us by rail. "Heading to the north" means opening  Sichuan to the neighboring countries via border-trade cities in  Xinjiang. "Heading to the south" means looking for land or sea  entry/exit points in places like Guangxi and Yunnan to expand  our trade with Southeast Asia. We plan to introduce from abroad  a number of projects that have a high technical content and high  added value through the establishment of Sino-foreign joint  ventures, Sino-foreign contractual joint ventures, and wholly  foreign-funded enterprises. In particular, we are going after  the creation of a large number of the "three kinds of  enterprises that are either wholly or partially foreign-funded,"  enterprises that have a high starting point and operate on a  large scale. We should exhaust all avenues to channel funds,  technology, projects, and managerial experience into Sichuan for  use in developing its economy.    [QIUSHI] Some people lament that Sichuan is a "bitter sea  without bounds." They are full of gripes and have no confidence  that Sichuan would achieve fast economic growth. How do you see  it?    [Xiao Yang] Sichuan is a landlocked province more than 2,000  kilometers from the coast or the border. As far as opening-up  and attracting foreign capital are concerned, Sichuan is no  doubt at a disadvantage compared to the coastal provinces. But  we should also be aware of our own strengths. We are trying to  put together a socialist market economy. That means we must  first of all have a market. We are a populous province with a  large volume of consumption, so the market potential is immense.  Suppose per capita consumption goes up 30 yuan. That would mean  an additional 3 billion yuan in the province, creating a market  for ourselves as well as a forum for the open policy. In this  sense, we should say, Sichuan has a relative edge. Provided we  break with the traditional way of thinking and practices and end  the isolation imposed on us by the "basic mentality," Sichuan's  economy will be able to orient itself to the world.    It is not right to gripe and complain. Yet it is imperative  that we genuinely identify the ways in which Sichuan falls  short. To a certain extent the gap between Sichuan and the coast  is mainly a result of our lagging behind in the formation of a  market mechanism and the development of principal players in the  market. What we must do at the moment is to work hard to nurture  the market system and develop a non-state economy even as we  search for a more rational and more effective operating  mechanism for the state economy, go all out to transform the  operating mechanism of large- and medium-sized state  enterprises, and make the most of the state economy as the  leading player in the economy. We must apply ourselves to the  development of the urban-rural shareholding cooperative economy  and push ahead with the "transformation, renovation, leasing,  sale, and merger" of small- and medium-sized industrial and  commercial state enterprises that have lost a good deal of  money. Develop the Sichuan economy even more rapidly and close  its gaps with the coastal provinces by deepening reform and  opening Sichuan more and more to the outside world.    Apart from its economic muscle and foundation, Sichuan also  boasts a scientific and technical army consisting of 1.4 million  people, something no other coastal province or municipality has,  with the exception of Shanghai. The people of Sichuan are  hard-working and intelligent. Once their thinking is liberated  and their intelligence and talents are fully tapped and put to  work, they will perform many miracles. Sichuan enjoys an edge in  resources as well. It also has a large number of backbone  enterprises that run the gamut of the industrial line-up and  that came of age during the three-front construction and the 15  years of reform and opening up to the outside world,  constituting a formidable industrial base. With all these  advantages, Sichuan's economy will achieve another quantum leap  provided we carry through with the party's line, principles, and  policies firmly and unwaveringly, adhere to economic  construction as our focus, further deepen reform and broaden the  open policy, and vigorously create a socialist market economy. I  am fully confident about that.</p>

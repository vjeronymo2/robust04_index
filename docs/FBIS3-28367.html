The message reads:    On the occasion of the 64th anniversary of the establishment  of the Communist Party of Vietnam, the LPRP Central Committee,  on behalf of party members and multiethnic Lao people, would  like to extend warmest greetings and best wishes to the CPV  Central Committee, party members, and all fraternal Vietnamese  people.    Since the inception of the CPV, which was founded, trained,  and molded by the great Chairman Ho Chi Minh, the party has led  the Vietnamese people to courageously carry out struggles and  create excellent heroic deeds of great historical significance  to conquer imperialist aggressors. As a result, it absolutely  liberated the nation and led the whole country to advance on the  socialist path. In the recent years, under the correct  leadership of the CPV, the Vietnamese people have significantly  enhanced the traditions of extreme patriotism and endeavors and  initiatives to successfully and firmly protect the fruits of  revolution. Besides, they have also attained very important  basic achievements in the cause of comprehensive renovation.  This has helped the national economy to enjoy the new firm  steps of development. The living conditions, both in material  and cultural aspects, of the people have noticeably been  improved. The role and prestige of the Socialist Republic of  Vietnam has been endlessly elevated in the international arena.    The LPDR and Lao people are very pleased with and would like  to wholeheartedly congratulate on such great achievements of the  CPV and fraternal Vietnamese people. Your glorious successes  have vigorously boosted the morale of the Lao people who have  also carried out the restructuring tasks too.    We would like to take this auspicious opportunity to wish  the  fraternal Vietnamese people under the leadership of the CPV,  which is headed by respected and beloved Comrade General  Secretary Do Muoi, to attain new and greater achievements in  implementing the resolutions of the seventh party congress and  the guidelines set by the party's recent meeting of  representatives from all parts of the country. We wish you all  continue to fulfill tasks of all-around renovation and advance  firmly to steadily bring to the SRV progress and prosperity.    We are delighted to see that our two parties, which are of  the same origin, have assisted each other sincerely and steadily  over the past years. On this honorable and glorious occasion of  the founding anniversary of the CPV, the LPRP Central Committee,  on behalf of the entire party and Lao people, would like to  express profound gratitude to the CPV and fraternal Vietnamese  people for having always rendered invaluable support and  assistance to the revolutionary tasks of Lao people.    May the great spirit of friendship, special solidarity, and  all-around cooperation between the two parties, countries, and  peoples of Laos and Vietnam last and flourish forever.</p>

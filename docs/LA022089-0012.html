			<p><P> February 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KHOMEINI RENEWS CALL FOR DEATH OF RUSHDIE  </P> <P> Iran's supreme leader, the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, overruling his  president and other Iranian moderates, declared Sunday that British author  Salman Rushdie must be killed and sent "to hell" for writing "The Satanic  Verses," a novel that many Muslims believe blasphemes Islam.  </P> <P> In a harshly worded statement that seemed certain to set the stage for a major  conflict with Britain and other Western nations, the 88-year-old Iranian  patriarch rejected Rushdie's apology to Muslims on Saturday and said the  Indian-born author could "never be forgiven" even if he repents.  </P> <P> "Even if Salman Rushdie repents and becomes the most pious man of all time, it  is incumbent upon every Muslim to employ everything he has, his life and  wealth, to send him to hell," Khomeini said in a statement released by the  official Iranian news agency IRNA.  </P> <P> The Iranian ruler also said that, while it is every Muslim's religious duty to  try to kill Rushdie, Iran would also handsomely reward any non-Muslim assassin  who got to the author first.  </P> <P> Several Iranian clerics, responding to Khomeini's initial call last week for  Rushdie's assassination, have already posted bounties of nearly $6 million on  the 41-year-old author's head.  </P> <P> "If a non-Muslim becomes aware of his whereabouts and has the ability to  execute him faster than a Muslim, it is incumbent upon Muslims to pay a reward  or a fee for this action," Khomeini said.  </P> <P> Khomeini's uncompromising remarks seemed bound to further incite a passionate  controversy raging throughout the Muslim world -- and, most significantly, even  in Iran itself -- over Rushdie's critically acclaimed but heretofore obscure  novel.  </P> <P> The controversy also seemed certain to increase Iran's isolation, not only from  the West but from the Arab world, where Islamic scholars -- while sharing  Iran's indignation over the book -- have condemned its calls for the author's  murder.  </P> <P> "Khomeini has the right to condemn the book, but not the man," a prominent  Egyptian Islamic intellectual said, echoing a sentiment expressed throughout  the Arab world, where the controversy over "The Satanic Verses" has generally  been muted.  </P> <P> Like a number of diplomats and other specialists who follow events in Iran,  this scholar said that the controversy over the Rushdie book in Iran appears to  be rooted more in politics than religion, reflecting an ongoing power struggle  within the leadership over the course that the Iranian revolution -- emerging  as the loser from a long and costly war with Iraq -- will take.  </P> <P> This view was reinforced by a number of conflicting signals over the Rushdie  affair emanating from Tehran over the past few days.  </P> <P> On Friday, only three days after Khomeini sentenced Rushdie to death, Iranian  President Ali Khamenei sought to defuse the crisis by suggesting that the  author could be "pardoned" if he repented and publicly apologized for the book.  </P> <P> The following day, Rushdie, who is under 24-hour police protection at a secret  location in Britain, issued a statement through his London literary agent  expressing "profound regret" for "the distress that publication (of his novel)  has occasioned to sincere followers of Islam."  </P> <P> IRNA, in a series of contradictory reactions that appeared to reflect political  conflict in Iran, subsequently rejected Rushdie's apology, then accepted it and  finally rejected it again.  </P> <P> On Sunday, in another indication of the conflict being waged in Iran, two  Tehran newspapers strongly criticized the clerics who have put a  multimillion-dollar bounty on Rushdie's life. "To pay one man to kill another  man is murder at a premium and not a religiously inspired act," the newspaper  Ettelaat said. Alluding to the power struggle, the English-language Tehran  Times added that those offering a reward for Rushdie's slaying "were demeaning  their religion for the sake of domestic political opportunism."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Radical Strategy Seen  </P> <P> Within the context of this divisive debate, the fact that Rushdie's fate seems  to have become suddenly entwined with that of the Iranian revolution has less  to do with the religious controversy surrounding "The Satanic Verses" than with  what Iran specialists view as an attempt by Iranian radicals to abort their  country's gradual reopening to the West following last year's cease-fire with  Iraq.  </P> <P> "What is taking place in Iran right now is a struggle between those who want to  rebuild the state and those who want to remain revolutionaries," said Fahmy  Hueidy, a prominent Egyptian writer on Islamic affairs and an Iran specialist  who has just returned from a visit to Tehran.  </P> <P> "The hard-liners, who have been forced to keep a low profile since the  cease-fire with Iraq, have found in this (Rushdie controversy) a pretext for  inciting the situation," he added.  </P> <P> While the uproar over the Rushdie affair clearly poses a threat to efforts by  Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani and other leading moderates to normalize  Iran's ties with Britain, France and other Western nations, President  Khamenei's conciliatory remarks on Friday were seen by most observers as an  indication that the pragmatists had more or less regained control of the  situation.  </P> <P> However, Khomeini's fiercely uncompromising statement appeared to deal a heavy  blow to these expectations and cast new doubts on Iran's postwar course.  </P> <P> While he avoided naming him by shifting the blame to the foreign press,  Khomeini nevertheless appeared to sharply rebuke Khamenei's efforts to end the  crisis by contradicting the president's offer of a pardon to Rushdie.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'This Is Denied, 100%'  </P> <P> "The imperialist foreign mass media are falsely alleging that officials of the  Islamic Republic have said that, if the author of 'The Satanic Verses' repents,  the execution order against him would be abolished. This is denied, 100%,"  Khomeini said.  </P> <P> Britain has responded to the Iranian threats against Rushdie's life by freezing  plans to increase the size of its embassy staff in Tehran. France indicated it  would postpone plans to send an ambassador back to Iran and said it would  consult with its European allies on a joint response to the threats against  Rushdie.  </P> <P> In Washington, Secretary of State James A. Baker III on Sunday called the death  threat against Rushdie "basically intolerable" behavior that will hamper Iran's  "rejoining the community of civilized nations." Baker made his remarks during  an interview on NBC-TV's "Meet the Press" program.  </P> <P> Less noted but no less significant has been the concern felt in the Arab world,  where the controversy over Rushdie's book has been eclipsed by shock and anger,  in both religious and secular circles, over the Iranian reaction to it.  </P> <P> On one level, the Iranian threats have reopened Islam's centuries-old schism  between the majority Sunni sect, which predominates throughout the Arab world,  and the Shiite sect, which rules in Iran. Sunnis have always considered  themselves to be more tolerant than the fundamentalist-oriented Shiites.  </P> <P> However, this distinction, while real, is also simplistic. For, while many  Sunnis seem to view the controversy as another example of Iranian Shiite  extremism, the offense felt over Rushdie's book is by no means confined to  Muslims of the Shiite sect.  </P> <P> "I have read the book, and I can say that it is very offensive to every  Muslim," said Ahmed Baha Eddin, one of Egypt's most respected newspaper  columnists.  </P> <P> Eddin, however, said he shares the indignation expressed Saturday by Egypt's  Nobel laureate, Naguib Mahfouz, who called Khomeini's decision to urge that  Rushdie be killed an act of "terrorism" against both "humanity and Islam  because it harms the reputation of Islam and Muslims in the civilized world."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Giving Islam a Bad Name  </P> <P> Concern that Iranian extremism is once again giving Islam a bad name was  underscored by a number of Islamic scholars and other intellectuals who pointed  out that, while violent demonstrations against Rushdie's book have taken place  in Pakistan, India and Western Europe, there have been no similar disturbances  in the Arab world.  </P> <P> Although "The Satanic Verses" is banned in many Arab countries, the notion that  "one has a right to kill someone for what he has written strikes most Muslims  as shocking and medieval," Eddin said.  </P> <P> The Canadian government, meanwhile, ruling Sunday on a complaint from an  unnamed Ottawa Muslim group, found that the book is not hate propaganda and  lifted a temporary ban on its import, Reuters news service said.  </P></p>

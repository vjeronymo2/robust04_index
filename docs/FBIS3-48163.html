The conference listened to 19 opinions expressed by  delegates  of different sectors, localities, and the armed forces. The  opinions were almost totally in agreement with the political  report on the achievements scored in the last two years, the  four challenging dangers, and the main duties in the coming  period.    Most of the opinions concentrated on the analysis of the  four  challenging dangers. They emphasized the possibility that our  country might be left behind at a great distance by regional and  other countries. They said that economic lagging also has  political meaning because it is the manifestation of a backward  general policy and not a practical economic policy.    Regarding the danger of peaceful evolution against socialism  from enemies, the delegates held that it is not only an external  danger but an internal danger as well. The reality of the  situation is that many reactionary groups have returned from  foreign countries to oppose and sabotage our country. This  danger, if we are not vigilant, it will become a reality.    With respect to corruption, the opinions held that  corruption  is not only practiced by a few people, but it resembles an  organization which operates from a system existing in state  organs. Corruption it not only tied to a conception of  morality, it also carries political meaning. Therefore, in  order to stop this danger, uniform measures must be applied.  The first of these measures is the education of cadres and  party members. In the implementation of a market mechanism and  door-open policy to the outside world, we need to further  strengthen the consolidation of our armed forces and the  maintenance of social security and order.    Through analysis, most of the delegates held that the basic  nature of these four dangers is the class struggle and who will  triumph over whom.    As for future duties, the delegates discussed the  definitions  of the terms of transferring economic structures and developing  industry with regard to the modernization of the national  economy. They said the transfer of economic structures creates  great values for key leading industries on the basis of  exploiting national potential and intelligence. Therefore, we  must continue to pay attention to economic development and  investment for mountainous and Central Highland areas. In  industrial development, we have to strengthen processing  industries and improve tree planting structures in agricultural  areas. By doing so, these areas can provide raw materials for  different industrial sectors. We must increase our exports and  encourage the use of our locally made products.    Tomorrow, 23 January, the MNPC delegates will continue to  work at the conference hall.</p>

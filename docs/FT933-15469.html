			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / International Company News: Rush to buy Chinese brewer's HK offering TSINGTAO Brewery, the first of nine mainland Chinese state-controlled companies to be listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, yesterday said its HKDollars 889m (USDollars 114.9m) public offer had been subscribed 110.5 times. Anheuser-Busch, the largest US brewer, has taken 5 per cent of the issue for HKDollars 126m, which suggests that Hong Kong and other foreign investors have put up HKDollars 84.3bn in their attempt to win stock in the Chinese brewer. Tsingtao's 'H' shares will begin trading on the Hong Kong exchange on July 15. The company offered investors 317.6m new shares, at HKDollars 2.80 each, or 35 per cent of the company's enlarged capital. A further 11 per cent of Tsingtao's shares will be issued as 'A' shares to mainland investors at a future date. The company's profits are forecast to rise to Yn193m (USDollars 33m) this year, compared with Yn44m in 1992. However further strong growth in profits may have to wait until 1995, when the company's fourth brewery comes on stream. The level of oversubscription for the Tsingtao issue fell well short of that achieved in February by Denway Investment, a Hong Kong-based mainland company with automotive assets in southern China. Denway sought HKDollars 402m, but speculators applied for HKDollars 240bn of stock. Since then, Hong Kong's monetary authorities - fearing a risk to the colony's banking system - have tightened regulations governing bank lending for new issues. However, in spite of this, market expectations were for Tsingtao to be subscribed by up to 300 times. China Everbright, a Chinese state-owned company, has acquired 25m shares of HTP Holdings. The investment represents 15 per cent of HTP and is the Chinese company's first large investment in the Singapore stock market.</p>

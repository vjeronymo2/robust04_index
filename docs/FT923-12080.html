			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Court in the video act THE British court system took a step into the technological age yesterday with the launch of a video designed for jurors. Topics covered include eligibility for jury service, what happens in court, and a juror's legal responsibilities including turning up on time and not discussing the case except with other jurors. The video - a still from which is shown - was commissioned by the Lord Chancellor's Department and will be shown to everyone called up for jury service in England and Wales. It will partly replace the traditional explanatory talk from the court staff, although they will still be available to answer questions. Televisions and videos have been installed to show the video at 45 crown courts. Jurors are warned that they may spend some time waiting during legal arguments, and that it is not always possible to predict the length of trials. Mr John Taylor, parliamentary secretary to the department, said the new televisions should be available for jurors to watch when not on a case while the video suggests they should bring along books, crosswords or knitting. The video had been tried out at a number of courts around the country and met with positive reaction, Mr Taylor said. Staff from Wood Green crown court, north London, where the video was filmed, play all the roles, except those of the judge, barristers and witness, who are played by actors.</p>

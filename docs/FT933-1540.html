			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Wates City of London in Pounds 24m cash call WATES CITY of London Properties, which in August reported a pre-tax profits fall from Pounds 3.74m to Pounds 860,000 and a passed dividend for the first half of 1993, is to raise about Pounds 24m net in a rights issue. Mr Rodney Clutton, development and property director of the company, all of whose properties but one fall within the core of the City, said the proceeds would be used to reduce borrowings 'to a comfortable level'. At June 30 they stood at Pounds 95m, since when they have been cut by Pounds 12m to Pounds 83m via the sale of Bolsa House, Cheapside. Wates said that at December 31 1992 gearing was 102 per cent. Adjusting for the rights proceeds and the Bolsa House sale, pro forma gearing at that same date would have been about 48 per cent. Some 34.3m new shares are to be issued at 72p on a 2-for-7 basis. Wates shares closed down 6p at 82p last night. The company said that after a long period of decline, there was now evidence that City property values were stabilising. Mr Clutton said that the rights issue was so that 'we don't have to sub-optimise and can protect our crown jewels', especially 100 Old Broad Street and 90 Queen Street. At the end of 1992, Wates sold 1-6 Milk Street for Pounds 9.35m and 20 Cannon Street for Pounds 14.2m. Mr John Nettleton, finance director, said in August that these properties were 'over-rented and old', but Mr Clutton said that more could have been got for them now. The rights has been fully underwritten by Morgan Grenfell. Brokers are Cazenove and SG Warburg Securities. COMMENT There seem to be fewer property purchases than rights issues these days and with no dividend payments on the horizon, this rescue rights could be seen as opportunistic. Many analysts harbour suspicions about it. Family and institutions close to the group have made recent share sales  - indeed the Wates Foundation sold the second 1.5m tranche of shares this year at the beginning of September. The success of the rights is assured, but perhaps this is more to do with the muscle of Cazenove and Warburg than investor feeling for Wates.</p>

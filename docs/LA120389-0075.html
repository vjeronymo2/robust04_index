			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOWN WITH DOCTRINES UP WITH A TREATY;  </P> <P> FINDING THE PROPER TERMS FOR A WORLD REBORN;  </P> <P> GEOPOLITICS: WITH THE SOVIETS FOLLOWING THE SINATRA DOCTRINE IN EUROPE, CAN THE  U.S. COME UP WITH A VERSION OF ITS OWN FOR CENTRAL AMERICA AND CUBA?  </P> <P> In December of 1968 I traveled to Prague with Argentinian writer Julio Cortazar  and Colombian novelist Gabriel Garcia Marquez. Our purpose was to express  solidarity with the Dubcek government, which was formally still in power, in  spite of the Soviet invasion in August of that year.  </P> <P> The Czechs, children of Franz Kafka and "The Good Soldier Schweik," were  maintaining the fiction that, if they withstood morally and intellectually,  they could maintain the Prague Spring in the face of Russian tanks surrounding  the city.  </P> <P> It was a brave but unrealistic myth. Yet, as Latin American writers, we were  asked to speak not of the Brezhnev Doctrine, which had come into existence to  justify the crushing of "socialism with a human face" in Czechoslovakia, and  which declared that once a country entered the Soviet Union's sphere of  influence and established a communist regime, it could never change the regime  or leave the sphere of influence.  </P> <P> We were asked, instead, to talk about the Monroe Doctrine. By mentioning U.S.  interventions in Latin America, our audiences would understand that we were  talking about Soviet interventions in Central Europe. "Monroe" would stand for  "Brezhnev."  </P> <P> Perestroika and glasnost began in Czechoslovakia two decades ago and were then  crushed right there. It is only fitting that now both concepts should return to  their place of origin. Instead of the Brezhnev Doctrine, we have what the  impish Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman, Gennady I. Gerasimov, whose humor is  perhaps more Gogolian than Kafkaesque, calls the Frank Sinatra Doctrine: Let  each country do it its way.  </P> <P> But comparing situations in the Soviet and the U.S. spheres of influence  (Central Europe and Central America), we have to wonder whether the Bush  Administration can come up with its own Sinatra Doctrine for El Salvador,  Nicaragua and Cuba; or whether we will all find ourselves in the paradoxical  position that while the Soviet Union moves forward with breathtaking  initiatives toward the 21st Century, it is the United States that hangs on to  anachronistic illusions about spheres of influence and ideological rigidity.  </P> <P> For the United States is not responding in Central America and the Caribbean to  imaginative and renovative Soviet policies in Europe. Perhaps this is  explainable because of yet another current paradox. In the era of economic  interdependence and instant communications, we are witnessing a resurrection of  the oldest nationalistic claims. From Armenia to Lithuania to the Ukraine, and  from Northern Ireland to Brittany to the Basque country, regional nationalisms  are sending warning signs to the process of European unification. The "common  house of Europe" will have to come up with some inventive forms of federalism  to meet these challenges.  </P> <P> But in Latin America, nationalism is not dispersed in eccentric regions, it is  strictly contained within national boundaries and states which, furthermore, it  identifies. Countries such as Brazil or Mexico have by now consolidated their  nationalism and can face the challenges of political and economic modernization  without outside interference. But nations such as Nicaragua are barely  establishing their national institutions, and defending them from constant  outside aggression. In fact, the Sandinista government has already defeated the  Contras and is now pushing for their elimination. But what Nicaragua is really  asking for is the liquidation of a century-old story of North American  interventionism. The current Nicaraguan regime bases its legitimacy, among  other things, on the fact that it is the first government since 1909 that does  not take orders from Washington. Once this is established, the elections next  February can proceed, under international supervision, to give free play to  opposition parties, consolidating national institutions and opening the way for  a greater participation of the infant civil society. But, again, the Bush  Administration has thought fit to forget the lessons of the past and imprint  its kiss of death on the cheek of Violetta Barrios de Chamorro, endorsed as the  U.S. candidate. The election thus becomes a contest between George Bush and  Daniel Ortega, much as the 1946 election in Argentina became a contest between  Juan Domingo Peron and his enemy, U.S. Ambassador Spruille Braden. Naturally,  the nationalist candidate won.  </P> <P> The Salvadoran situation cannot be compared with the one developing in  Nicaragua. The FMLN guerrillas were not invented, as the Contras were, abroad.  They are native to El Salvador and in El Salvador they win or lose. The FMLN  not only controls big chunks of territory, it has also been capable of  launching a violent offensive in the capital itself, to force President Alfredo  Cristiani into serious negotiations or face the reality of uninterrupted  bloodletting in a stalemated situation.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration pretends to go on arming the Salvadoran army and death  squads while demanding that the Soviet Union cease to arm Nicaragua or the  FMLN. This attitude not only rejects Moscow's assurance that it has ceased to  arm any parties in Central America, it evades the responsibility shared by both  the United States and the Soviet Union not to send arms to anyone in Central  America. This is the issue, and Bush will not join it. One can only surmise  that perhaps Washington stands more to lose if no U.S. arms are sent to the  Contras and the Salvadorans than if the Sandinistas or the FMLN receive no  further shipments.  </P> <P> But if Bush were to proclaim the Sinatra Doctrine in Central America, we would  quickly see a rush to the negotiating table in El Salvador and normalizing  political relations in Nicaragua. Can anyone truly believe, as the East Bloc  opens, that Gorbachev has the intention, let alone the capacity, of gambling it  all away on establishing Stalinist dictatorships in two remote Central American  ministates? If not Kafka or Gogol, this idea defies Marx -- not Karl, Groucho.  </P> <P> The problem, of course, is Cuba -- and that is where the proof will come. The  Castro regime is each day more isolated from its old alliances in the communist  world. In 1963, a stormy session of the Cuban Cabinet debated whether to  denounce or support the invasion of Czechoslovakia by the Warsaw Pact forces.  Fidel Castro hoped that the Czechs would resist. But there is no Sierra Maestra  on the Danube. Once more, Fidel was forced to follow not the policy he would  have wanted to, but the policy he had to.  </P> <P> U.S.-Cuban relations reveal a reciprocal insecurity. Castro is afraid that if  he opens any door, the gringos will play a trick on him. And Bush, perhaps, is  afraid that if relations with Cuba are mended, the United States will be left  without enemies for one of its deepest needs: to identify villains, put on its  white hat and ride off to combat the bad guys. Without an evil empire, the  United States is forced to match the diplomatic imagination of Gorbachev. It is  in Central America and Cuba where Bush, with as much guts as Gorbachev in  Central Europe, can restore credibility to North American statesmanship.  </P></p>

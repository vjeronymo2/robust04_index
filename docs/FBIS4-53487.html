			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 17 (YONHAP) -- Following a month-long  tug-of-war, the ruling and main opposition parties finally  agreed Tuesday to conduct a parliamentary investigation into the  Sangmudae scandal.    The agreement came at a meeting of party floor leaders at  the  National Assembly Tuesday morning. The assembly is expected to  begin the probe right after it approves investigation plans at  an extraordinary session to be convened on Saturday.    The accord was the product of a rare compromise worked out  between the ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) and the  opposition Democratic Party (DP), both of which were well aware  of the public's critical eye on the Sangmudae scam.    The scandal involves a medium-sized construction company  which received a multibillion won contract from the Defense  Ministry to move a military facility called Sangmudae in Kwangju  to the outskirts of the city.    The DP alleges that the president of the company siphoned  part of the project's profits into a slush fund, which  eventually found its way into the ruling circle and was used as  campaign expenses during the 1992 presidential election.    The opposition party has demanded that the National Assembly  invoke its right to investigate national affairs and find out  how the alleged slush fund was used and by whom.    The DLP and DP have been bickering for a month over who  should be called as witnesses. The DP finally gave in and  agreed with the DLP to limit the number of witnesses to 30, as  the ruling party insisted. The opposition party also agreed not  to include current and former presidents as witnesses.    As for the probe's length, the two parties had originally  agreed that it would last 20 days. The DP demanded that 20 more  days be added, however, and the ruling party apparently gave in  as a compromise for the issue of witnesses.    In addition, the two sides agreed to trace the whereabouts  of  checks totaling 27.7 billion won that had allegedly been used by  the construction company's president, Cho Ki-hyon.    There is no denying that for ruling party officials, the  proposed investigation of the Sangmudae scam is an irksome  undertaking, even though the scandal allegedly took place during  the administration of Former President No Tae-u.    A parliamentary investigation into the scam would expose  many  old as well as new members of the ruling party.    Consequently, the DLP is expected to minimize the effects of  the investigation as much as possible.    The Defense Ministry and the prosecution have already  undertaken separate, thorough investigations into the scam. The  ruling party is thus insisting that a parliamentary probe would  reveal little else.    Everything that could possibily be known by authorities is  already known, and some other aspects alleged by the opposition  party have been rejected by the prosecution due to a lack of  hard evidence.    What worries the ruling party, therefore, is the possibility  that the opposition party will launch a political offensive  during the parliamentary investigation, although the DP has  already agreed not to call the present and former presidents and  lawmakers as witnesses.    Both the ruling and opposition parties would face severe  criticism if the upcoming probe failed to produce any  substantial results since the DP has managed to plant deep  suspicion among ordinary citizens through its unsubstantiated  allegations.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Slovak Deputy Prime Minister Roman Kovac asked  Slovak Television today to allow him to make a statement on the  current political situation:    [Begin Kovac recording] I would like to emphasize, in this  tense political situation, that the establishment of the  Alternative of Political Realism within the Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] is neither a deviation from its  principles nor a betrayal. I am afraid that our honest  intentions have been misinterpreted. Therefore, as one of the  signatories of the Alternative, I would like to explain our  proposal for dealing with the situation.    The political situation in the Slovak Republic is rather  tense. Its worst feature is the situation in parliament, where  the government is struggling with its need for a majority. As a  result, parliament faces difficulties and is not able to pass  important economic and social laws that are eagerly awaited by  the population. On one side, there are diverging views and there  is insufficent willingness to reach agreement; on the other,  there is a well-coordinated attitude of the opposition. This,  together, is paralyzing the work of parliament.    A democratic and a constitutional solution to this  situation,  which is in the interests of Slovakia as a whole, is early  parliamentary elections. It is equally in the interests of  Slovakia as a whole to make use of the time before early  parliamentary elections to make sure that steps toward economic  and social transformation are not halted. This requires a  sensible agreement between all political forces, asked for by  three-quarters of our population.    A group of parliamentary deputies and two members of the  government put forward a possible solution within the HZDS  parliamentary group: to create, before early parliamentary  elections, a broad, coalition government that would consist of  candidates from the majority of political forces. The role of  this government would be to make participating parties  concentrate on topical problems and to share political  responsibility for solving them.    At the election, citizens will have to decide the direction  Slovakia is to follow in the future. The right thing to do  would be for the top representatives of the political entities  to agree on this solution and, under the leadership of the HZDS,  to form such a government jointly for a transitional period.  This would also make it possible to continue with the tasks  planned by the HZDS. Their personal attitudes and mutual  relations, however, make this step unlikely.    This is why the idea came into being of setting up a  government without the personal participation of the chairmen of  the parties and to include in this government a number of  experts without political affiliation. This is not a negation  of the election result. This is simply the acknowledgement of  the real distribution of political forces in parliament before  early elections.    Only the continuation of economic and social measures that  will gain sufficient support from the political forces will be  able help Slovakia to overcome growing problems in the  economy--the growth of unemployment and of social tension,  problems in health care and education, and the decline in our  citizens' standard of living.    It is impossible to continue the politics of confrontation,  promoting the one and only correct view. It is necessary to  stop seeing things in black and white and to get rid of the  slogan "Who is not with us is against us." To reach agreement  is in the real interests of Slovakia. This is not political  naivete. This is political realism. [end recording]</p>

			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Enterprise Computer back in the black Enterprise Computer Holdings, the Berkshire-based computer services group which has repositioned itself in the market, has returned to profit after a period of substantial losses. The pre-tax profit of Pounds 90,000 for the six months to September 30 included Pounds 677,000 from the disposal of an investment in an associated company. The previous first half suffered a Pounds 3.41m deficit and the loss for that year came to Pounds 6.03m. Turnover for the latest six months fell to Pounds 9.9m (Pounds 35.5m) earned entirely from mainframe sales and service. Last year's figure also included Pounds 6.63m from operations now discontinued. Mr John Small, chairman, said the sales decline reflected 'the general fall in demand for second-user mainframes,' However, the group's change of focus towards providing corporation-wide network systems meant that mainframes represented less than 30 per cent of sales. Interest payments jumped to Pounds 286,000 (Pounds 51,000) but the company said they were running at a much reduced level than in the second half of last year. Losses per share were shaved to 0.02p (4.3p). Mr Small added that SRH, in which Enterprise is a minority shareholder, was selling its communications division to TSB International of Canada. Consequently a Pounds 3.5m loan owed to Enterprise would be redeemed early in 1994.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Amman -- The deputies of the Jordanian Islamic  Action Front [IAF] today denounced the Jordanian-Israeli  agreements signed recently, considering them a clear recognition  of the Zionist entity and its usurpation of security, stability,  and waters in the region.    In a statement in Amman today, the deputies said: We think  that these agreements represent a Jordanian retreat from the  constant principles reiterated repeatedly by the officials,  mainly, rejecting unilateral peace, adhering to the Islamic and  Arab character of Jerusalem, and the right of the refugees to  return to their usurped country.    The Jordanian IAF deputies stressed their condemnation and  rejection of this approach that is being pursued by the  Jordanian government, contrary to the attitudes of the Jordanian  people who reject all these concessions, noting that the opinion  of the Jordanian people and their representatives was not sought  on these negotiations that target their land, destiny, and  future.    Also, the Jordanian Arab Constitutional Front Party has  asserted that Syria represents the strong spirit of the Arabs in  the face of the enemies of the Arab nation and their supporters.    In a statement today, the party said: At a time when we were  expecting to consolidate and expand cooperation and coordination  between Jordan and fraternal Syria to overcome this serious,  decisive stage of the peace talks, the new Jordanian position to  resume the Jordanian-Israeli negotiations in Washington came as  a destructive turning point for the Arab position in its  stronger Damascus-Amman-Beirut front.    The statement went on: Our Jordanian people were surprised  by this serious turning point which was peddled by diverting the  attention of the people by what preceded the recent cabinet  reshuffle and the statements about more coordination and  cohesion between Syria and Jordan. The Jordanian officials  themselves said that coordination enhances the Arab negotiating  position to a level that can force the occupiers to submit to  the resolutions of international legitimacy by withdrawing from  all the occupied Arab territories.    The statement added that the new position of the Jordanian  government, whose head had led the negotiations before he  assumed the premiership, constitutes an imminent danger to  Jordan and the Palestinian cause and is an offense to the  requirements of coordination and cooperation between the Arab  brothers in Syria and Lebanon.    It added that all that Syria is facing is on account of its  adherence to Arab rights, embodied in the constant principles of  the nation, noting that Syria is standing like a solid wall in  the face of all international pressures and Arab deviations.    The statement concluded: The new policy of the Jordanian  government will lead us to an inevitable national disaster.  Jordan -- land and people -- does not stand to gain from  turning its back on its brothers. Its interest lies in  harmonizing its steps and policies with the steps of its Arab  brothers.    Tujan Faysal, member of the Jordanian House of  Representatives, said the Jordanian government has shown  reservations over the question of comprehensive coordination  among Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon.    In an interview with the Lebanese newspaper AL-HAYAH, the  Jordanian deputy added: I am against this position. I believe  that if I am looking for solutions to the economic problems,  then I should coordinate my cooperation with any Arab party so  that we can achieve what is better and more useful for both of  us.    Answering another question, Deputy Tujan Faysal said the  opposition deputies at the Jordanian parliament have felt that  the Jordanian government opposes Syrian proposals because it  thinks these proposals aim at something wider than what we want.    Mrs. Tujan asked: Is this reasonable and logical? How can  it be in our interest to coordinate with Israel and the PLO  leadership and ignore coordination with the Arabs, such as Syria  and Lebanon?    Answering another question, Mrs. Tujan said: The popular  forces that stood with Iraq during the Gulf war today want to  coordinate with Syria. This stems from our feeling that we are  facing a common enemy and that Syria still refuses to make  concessions to this enemy. So is it in our interest to leave  Syria and adopt a unilateral stance in the face of this enemy?    She added: If we cite the pretext that we are doing this  because we are a small, weak nation and our economy is suffering  from difficulties, then we can reply to this by saying that it  is in our interest to cooperate and coordinate more closely with  Syria, since it is a big country that has a strong economy.  This will be more secure for us than dealing with Israel, which  only thinks about how to swallow us and devour our rights after  dealing with us individually.    She added: The Jordanian people demand coordination with  Syria while the government insists on heading west toward  Israel. It was no coincidence that the Jordanian information  minister's statements about the details of the agreement with  Israel came in the wake of increasing promises that the people  will see economic boom and prosperity.</p>

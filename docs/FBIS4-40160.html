			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Dmitriy Gorokhov] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 14 TASS--"If there were no initiative  from President Boris Yeltsin, nobody knows how the war over  Sarajevo would have ended," Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic  said in Moscow today, speaking of support extended by Russia to  Bosnian Serbs. During his meeting with Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev, the Bosnian Serb leader called the Russian  people "friends of the Serbs for centuries."    Karadzic, who arrived in Moscow for receiving Mikhail  Sholokhov Literary Award conferred on him by the Writers' Union  of Russia, said that he plans to meet with representatives of  different political movements. At the same time the Serb  politician emphasised that he does not intend to forget the  important role played by the Russian Government and Russian  diplomacy in the search for a peaceful solution to the Bosnian  conflict. According to Karadzic, the Bosnian Serbs are aware of  Russia's objective stand, and do not expect any one-sided or  unbalanced approach to events in the region.    "It is very difficult to end the civil war, because not only  armies, but civilians are also involved in combat actions,"  Karadzic said. "We are getting tired of the crisis which  continues for several years. We need peace, so as to construct  a democratic society and a free economy," he said.</p>

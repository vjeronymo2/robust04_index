			<p>CSO     [Text] Various circles think that lifting the American  embargo on Vietnam will threaten the Indonesian ability to  attract foreign investments.    "Lifting the embargo will have a serious and direct effect  on  Indonesia, in addition to the low labor costs there. For that  reason, Indonesia must really compete with Vietnam," said  Sanyoto Sastrowardojo, state minister for investment (Meninves)  and chairman of the Investment Board, at the DPR  [Parliament]/MPR [People's Consultative Council] building this  week.    Aburizal Bakrie, general chairman of the Indonesian Chamber  of Commerce and Industry; J. B. Bambang Warih Koesoema, member  of the DPR's Commission VI; Djaf'ar H. Assegaff, Indonesian  ambassador to Vietnam; and the economic observers Christianto  Wibisono and Hartojo Wignyowijoto, made similar statements.  However, Sanyoto said, lifting the embargo will also provide an  opportunity to export Indonesian goods to that country.    At the same time, said Bambang, Indonesia must implement an  integrated and comprehensive action plan in order to meet the  increased competition.    "Planned and integrated measures must be taken in order to  meet the increased competition from Vietnam."    Dja'far, the new Indonesian ambassador to Vietnam, stated  that lifting the American embargo on Vietnam should spur  Indonesia to increase its competitive abilities.    "However, we need to think positively, that is, how can the  two countries take advantage of what each one does best for  their common good."    Dja'far explained that the first step to be taken in  anticipation of lifting the embargo would be to open up direct  trade relations between Vietnam and Indonesia. "Indonesian trade  with Vietnam has never been direct but has had to go through a  third country. This is inefficient and wasteful."    At the same time, Christianto Wibisono, director of the  Indonesian Business Data Center (PBDI), said that Indonesia  should not be too concerned about the embargo being lifted.    "Indonesia has a 25-year lead so why should we worry? What  we  have to do is figure out how to maintain our position."    Vietnam, he continued, still has a lot of fixing up to do  before it can increase foreign investment in the country.  "Indonesia has a much better infrastructure. Right now Vietnam  is like Indonesia was in the 1970s."    For Hartojo the most serious threat that we have to be  concerned about is that Vietnam has copied various regulations  in the field of oil and natural gas mining (Migas).    "They have plagiarized our ideas about mining contracts  exactly, meaning that they are prepared to compete with  Indonesia in attracting investors who are active in the field of  Migas mining."    Aburizal said that Vietnam can be an extension of  investments  from various Indonesian companies.</p>

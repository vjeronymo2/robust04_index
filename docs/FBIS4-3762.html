			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News" program] </F>   [Text] About eight to 10 renegade soldiers of the People's  Liberation Army [PLA] were involved in the mass murder of 24  Taiwan tourists last month and the three mainland civilians  arrested were just scapegoats, lawmakers quoted Taiwan's top  intelligence officials as saying. Lawmaker Chen Shui-pien  quoted National Security Bureau Director (Yin Chung-wen) as  saying that their intelligence sources in the Mainland showed  that PLA soldiers were behind the Chientao [Qiandao] lake murder.    From the beginning of the incident, the National Security  Bureau sources indicated that it was a premeditated robbery and  murder case, not an accident as earlier claimed by Chechiang  [Zhejiang] authorities, the lawmaker said. Mainland authorities  on Sunday [17 April] announced the arrest of three civilian  suspects, all natives of Chechiang, on charges of murder,  robbery, and arson but they gave few details about them or the  evidence against the suspects. In Peking [Beijing] on Wednesday  [20 April], an Mainland Foreign Ministry spokesman categorically  denied Taiwan's allegation of army involvement in this pleasure  boat arson.</p>

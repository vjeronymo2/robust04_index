			<p>BFN     [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 23/5/1994 -- President Mircea  Snegur's decision to join the governing party, the Agrarian  Democratic Party of Moldova [PDAM], reveals unsteadiness in his  political views, declared to BASA Valentin Krylov, a leader of  the Socialist Party. According to Krylov, previously, President  Snegur declared that the president should be above any party's  interests. "It might seem that the president has changed his  political views, thought it is possible that he follows two  objectives: to give more strength to the PDAM before local  elections and to prepare to run as an agrarian for President in  1996, which are expected to be multi-party," said Krylov,  mentioning that "today it is not too early to consider the next  presidential elections and the PDAM will gain much strength from  Snegur's membership."</p>

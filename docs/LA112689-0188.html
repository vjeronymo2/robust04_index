"The case will be reopened if something develops."  </P> <P> The bodies of an elderly Hemet couple, Robert Reid, 84, and Thelma Reid, 75,  were found late Thursday amid debris from the wreckage of the Lucky R, the  cabin cruiser owned by their son, Charles Reid of Long Beach. Relatives told  Coast Guard officials that Charles Reid also was aboard the boat, which was  found demolished about 10 miles northeast of Avalon.  </P> <P> Coast Guard investigators are trying to piece together remains of the boat in  an effort to determine what happened.  </P></p>

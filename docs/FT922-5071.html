			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Business in Thailand urges new elections THAILAND'S private sector called yesterday for the dissolution of parliament and new elections in an attempt to break a political deadlock following the killing last month of at least 48 pro-democracy demonstrators. The Federation of Thai Industries, the Board of Trade of Thailand and the Thai Bankers' Association made their appeal after a meeting yesterday to discuss the political crisis. The three groups acknowledged that the country's image had been tarnished by the clashes between soldiers and demonstrators but expressed confidence in the future of the Thai economy. Elections were held in March this year, a year after Gen Suchinda Kraprayoon, the then armed forces chief, overthrew the previous elected government on the grounds that it was excessively corrupt. Five pro-military parties formed a government and eventually chose Gen Suchinda as prime minister, outraging liberals who took to the streets to demand a reformed constitution and an end to military influence in politics. Gen Suchinda was forced to resign, leaving the five discredited coalition parties casting around for a replacement. In their statement yesterday, the three private sector organisations said they wanted an interim government followed by new elections because the present situation did not favour the formation of 'a permanent government that is of good quality, stable and acceptable to the public at large'. Last night Mr Arthit Urairat, the president of the Thai parliament, said he was postponing the search for a new prime minister until after the constitutional amendments demanded by the opposition had passed their final reading in parliament on June 10. Another unresolved issue arising from the violence is the fate of an amnesty decreed by Gen Suchinda shortly before he quit. Opposition groups have challenged the amnesty and referred it to the Constitutional Tribunal because it covers military officers who ordered the killing as well as demonstrators.</p>

			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Nigeria postpones civilian handover Nigeria's handover to civilian rule has been postponed from next January to August 27, President Ibrahim Babangida announced last night, writes Michael Holman. Last month the military government nullified the results of presidential primaries, marred by widespread electoral fraud, and sacked the executives of the country's two permitted parties. President Babangida, speaking in the federal capital of Abuja, said that the 23 presidential candidates who ran in the primaries would be disqualified from contesting the presidential election now set for June 12. The government is now expected to redouble efforts to renew a lapsed stand-by agreement with the IMF. Negotiations have been affected by uncertainty over the hand-over timetable. An agreement is an essential precondition to further rescheduling of Nigeria's Dollars 30bn external debt.</p>

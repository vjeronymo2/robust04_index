			<p><P> December 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEST AIR TRYING TO ACQUIRE ROUTES OF VIRGINIA AIRLINE  </P> <P> West Air said Tuesday that it is talking with United Airlines about taking over  the routes of a troubled Virginia airline that halted operations Monday.  </P> <P> West Air, based in Fresno, said it wants to take over the routes of  Presidential Airways, which fed passengers from small East Coast cities to  United Airlines' hub at Washington's Dulles International Airport. Presidential  filed for bankruptcy protection in October.  </P> <P> West Air feeds passengers from small airports in California, Washington state  and Oregon to United hubs in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle and Portland.  It is the nation's largest regional airline and, as part of a marketing  agreement with United, operates under the name United Express.  </P> <P> West Air is not the only airline interested in Presidential's routes. A person  familiar with the situation said Tuesday that Air Wisconsin, an Appleton,  Wis.-based regional airline that already flies into the Washington area, is  also interested in Presidential's business. Air Wisconsin is also a United  Express carrier.  </P> <P> Mark Peterson, a spokesman for West Air, said the regional airline is not yet  sure how it would deploy aircraft to take over Presidential's 24 daily flights  from six cities. He said West Air has orders and options for 37 British  Aerospace Jetstream 31 aircraft, some of which could be used for an East Coast  operation. The new aircraft are to be delivered through 1992.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The environmental scandal surrounding the storage  of [former] German Democratic Republic-produced toxic pesticide  waste in northern Albania is evidently greater than previously  assumed. Environmental protection organizations yesterday warned  that entire regions could become contaminated, severely  threatening thousands of people. Greenpeace spoke of  pesticide-poisoned "chemical lakes."    The Federal Environment Ministry also conceded yesterday  that  the drums were "improperly" stored. According to Environment  Minister Toepfer (CDU [Christian Democratic Union]) there is a  total of 4,000 tons of pesticides in Albania, some of it highly  toxic, that had been delivered by the World Bank, the European  Union, and Germany. One liter of this substance is enough to  contaminate two million liters of drinking water.    The toxic waste also includes 217 tons of GDR pesticides,  which according to the Environment Ministry in Bonn were  exported by Lower Saxony playing card firm Schmidt-Cretan in  1991 and 1992.    Greenpeace claims that at the time the cargo, totaling 790  tons, was declared as "humanitarian aid" to agriculture. The  environmental protection group tracked the toxic pesticides down  two years ago in wagons of the eastern German railways.  Government agencies in Bonn had known about the drums for years  but so far failed to do anything.    According to Toepfer (CDU), the German authorities had so  far  looked in vain for a World Bank and EU [European Union] disposal  program. Toepfer now announced Germany would go for it alone.  The possibility of "bringing them back" was currently being  examined. He had already sent a team of experts from the  Technical Support Service to Albania at the end of December.    Toepfer is considering bringing the drums back to Germany by  ship. He is afraid Albania is not an isolated case. Hungary  and the Ukraine are also affected.    Meanwhile, Greenpeace yesterday began making the pesticide  containers safe. About 20 drums were packed and taken to the  Yugoslav border by truck. It describes the situation in some  places in northern Albania as catastrophic. "Drums are leaking,  a chemical cocktail is seeping into the ground, gasses are  escaping," Greenpeace says. People were complaining of burning  eyes and breathing difficulties. Drinking water wells were  threatened.</p>

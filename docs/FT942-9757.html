			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Wool offerings in the closing weeks of the Australian selling season are normally low and this week auctions were held on only two instead of the normal three days. Prices moved sharply ahead for finer merinos, and the market indicator rose above the 600 cent mark which many feel provides the prospect of economic production for most wool growers. The Wool international market indicator was 603 cents at the close, compared with 587 a week before. Currency developments have tended to underline the rise in wool costs in most wool using countries in the past week or so. Recognition of a rising price trend for wool is obvious among those trading near to the raw wool end of the trade, but manufacturers and retailers are proving more difficult to convince that high prices must now be paid.</p>

			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Brussels ruling on perfume marketing THE European Commission has outlawed the establishment of an elite list of top brands of scent which could restrict competition in the distribution of luxury perfumes. But at the same time Brussels has underlined its basic approval of the way in which high-prestige, image-driven perfumes are sold in the EC through selected distributors. The Commission yesterday redefined the system operated by Parfums Givenchy, the French luxury scent company. Its investigation found that Givenchy was preventing its distributors from stocking competing brands which were not on a list drawn up by the manufacturer. The practice could have restricted the prestige market to an elite dozen or so brands, but Givenchy and its competitors will now have to delete such clauses from their distribution contracts. Under a deal with the Commission, Givenchy cannot prevent new distributors from joining the network except on quality grounds, such as their location or the cleanliness of the store. The Commission has also outlawed contract clauses which set unreasonably high sales requirements, and restrict the sale of perfumes between authorised retailers. EC competition rules allow luxury perfume to be sold through selected distributors.</p>

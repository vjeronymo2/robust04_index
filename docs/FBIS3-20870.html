I know that no prophet is welcome in his own house, but I  must admit that I am surprised by the amount of hatred that  spills forth upon each of my absences from the city. At the same  time, the president of the republic and the people at the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs understand this, they know exactly  what I am doing, that I do not do anything privately.    Dr. Zlatko Kramaric, the mayor of Osijek and the vice  chairman of the Croatian Social-Liberal Party [HSLS], has been a  focal point of interest by the Croatian political public for  some time now. In recent weeks, however, this has been not  because of his political virtues or shortcomings, his good or  bad moves, but rather because he and his city government have  been forced to move out of their previous office space in their  own city. The conflict with the zupanija government, headed by  Branimir Glavas, the zupan of Osijek-Baranja Zupanija,  culminated in arbitration by the government of the Republic of  Croatia, which ruled in favor of the zupanija government. In an  interview which he himself called candid, he talks openly about  this fight for office space for municipal authorities, but also  about his frequent travels abroad, because of which he has often  been targeted by no small number of critics from the ranks of  the ruling party, and about the latest clashes within his own  party.    [Divjak] In the so-called fight with the zupanija  government,  you lost "on points," through the judge's decision. There was no  knockout, but from the beginning you had little, practically no  chance of winning. Why then did you even contest the issue?    [Kramaric] I see this as a candid interview, where there is  trust between us, and I believe in your good intentions, while I  think that you believe in mine as well. You yourself have said  that this was a so-called fight and I do not want to speak in  terms of winners or losers. It even seems to me that if one  analyzes some of my actions, I have continuously tried to avoid  any conflict, because I am not a contentious person by nature,  at least not in politics.  <H5>  No Cause for Feeling Triumphant </H5>   If there was some program of mine as a person that  characterized the elections in this region in 1993, it was a  story of cooperation. And I think that I have consistently  represented this story, not only during the elections, but also  when we assumed power in May 1993; I continually spoke of  patience because I wanted to reach an agreement that would  satisfy both sides. If we examine the genesis of what happened  10 days ago, we arrive at a situation where we must reveal  certain stories and certain details that should perhaps be  forgotten. Quite simply, the situation is this. I felt that in a  certain fight I did not have the necessary support that I should  have received from certain institutions to keep from ending up  in a position where someone, as you say, would be knocked out  and someone else would triumph. I took one step that was by no  means easy. I would call that the three hardest days of my life.  I made a decision that can be called this or that, that can even  be considered anti-city, that could go down as a bad decision,  but that is a political assessment. I considered that I was not  acting as poorly as some might interpret, and I wanted to create  the preconditions for the city government to finally be able to  do the things that it was entrusted to do in the elections.    Nearly a year has passed since the elections, but the  preconditions for achieving a real demarcation between the  authorities and the competences of local self-rule, the zupanija  and city governments, have not been created. There are plenty of  these unclarified areas here, so to speak, and it is not easy to  be prudent and rational. It could easily happen that if the next  elections are won by some other party that has thwarted our  efforts right now, it would then accuse us of not having fought  for enough self-rule. That is politics. Time will tell whether I  have made a mistake, but I think that no one has any cause for  feeling triumphant.    [Divjak] Nevertheless, the city government has been expelled  from the center of the city, it has gone to the old heart of the  city, which is the former heart, but today there is nothing left  of that?    [Kramaric] We can talk in terms of serious frivolity. For  the  city, it could seemingly turn out to be a bad move, it could  turn out to be a good move. If we support the policentric  development of Croatia, then there is no reason not to support  the policentric development of Osijek. Perhaps our return to the  old heart of the city, where city hall used to stand, will help  to bridge the gap that exists between the three parts of Osijek.  Perhaps that will not be so bad either, as it rightly appears  today.    [Divjak] What is Osijek actually--a city or the capital of a  zupanija?    [Kramaric] I always see Osijek as a city, and I am the  spokesman for a certain civic element in this city. You have the  impression that cities that are also zupanija capitals are in  some sense also penalized, placed in a position where there are  two powerful people acting in one place, if I may say that in  this case. But I think that there is room for both and that time  will tell in this regard as well. Everyone should deal with his  own problems and accept the situation as it is.    [Divjak] Of the two powerful people of whom you speak, one  was not at all gentle in describing you, not choosing words....    [Kramaric] I will say this--my study of philosophy has  taught  me tranquility. I have always said, I love the media: If there  are disagreements, then they are conceptual in nature, not  personal. I can disagree with some concept, be opposed to it,  but I cannot be against a person because my nature does not  permit it. I am not structured for that and you cannot hear  harsh words from me.    [Divjak] Charges are often leveled concerning your travels.  To what extent is there any real, general benefit from them, and  to what extent is there personal benefit, as is charged? For  example, you recently spent 10 days in the United States.  <H5>  Clinton's Invitation </H5>   [Kramaric] Actually, I have sometimes wondered whence and  for  what reason such odium has arisen, even among the public,  concerning each of my trips. I do travel on business, I do not  ask anyone to invite me, and I do think that my activities  before and during the war created a certain image of me, of the  city, of the political option that I advocate, in the world at  large. I think that the image that I have created and conveyed  is never harmful to Croatia; on the contrary, that it displays  certain other colors and most often that is the motivation  behind certain invitations that I receive and that I often must  carry out, around 80 percent of them. There really are a lot of  them.    But the invitation from the U.S. Congress and President  Clinton, to attend a certain event that for us Europeans, and  especially Croats, has an almost metaphysical appeal in the  sense that you are attending a "national breakfast," a prayer  meeting, which did not last only one day. Congressman Wolf says,  "We want to hear your story too." This is an opportunity for you  to meet with a number of very important and influential U.S.  politicians, and if you want to change your image, then you must  tell a story and someone must want to hear that story. It is  better for us to talk than for there to exist an entire series  of prejudices and stereotypes about us, which unfortunately do  exist. We are a nation whose history has been disputed, about  whose history others are unaware. If you get the opportunity to  interpret this disputed history, to show our truth to those  people who make the decisions, then that is a big thing. And  Kramaric uses these trips precisely for that purpose.    It is interesting that I have a much higher rating at the  State Department, in Bonn, or elsewhere far beyond our borders,  than I have at home. I know that no one is a prophet in his own  house, but I must admit that I am surprised by the amount of  hatred that spills forth upon each of my absences from the city.  When it comes down to it, I could be very private and say that I  have a son who is of the age when he requires his father's  presence, that I have an obligation to him. It is clearly not  simple. There you come into contact with people who are clearly  not well-disposed toward us, who know how to raise very perverse  questions, and you have to be very skillful to defend something  known as Croatian politics and the Croatian situation.    At the same time, the president of the republic and the  people at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs understand this, they  know exactly what I am doing, that I do not do anything  privately. This is delicate work, which often lands you in  delicate situations that it is definitely not easy to get out  of, and it seems to me that I have done a good job. It is not up  to me to make that assessment, but if you have direct contact  with a man named Reismueller, who is a difficult person and does  not talk to just anyone, if he wants to hear my assessments and  is interested in what I think about the situation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, and if I can express that opinion elsewhere  as well, then you have to respect these in no sense easy efforts  that you make up your mind to do as a person.    [Divjak] During your trip, you met with James Baker, who  today is increasingly feeling remorse for what the West has done  in the former Yugoslavia. Does he really understand what he did  in June 1991 in Belgrade?    [Kramaric] You know, perhaps Baker has not evolved as much  as  we would like him to, and he still has a very negative attitude  toward the Croatian position regarding Bosnia. I met with Baker  together with, among others, representatives of Romania,  Bulgaria, and Hungary. While the Bulgarians and Romanians were  euphoric when discussing Baker's visits in 1990 and 1991, I had  the good fortune to observe and say to him that we in Croatia do  not share this enthusiasm and that in fact we regard his visit  to Belgrade in June 1991 as a green light for all the horrors  and calamities that happened after that.    Naturally, no one said that he imagined that what he did at  the time would have such consequences, but it did, and in any  event Baker has heard that now. That much is clear to him now,  but there is still an awareness that tries to equate the  aggressor and the victim and that must be told that this is a  classic imperialist, ideological, colonial war, a war for  territory. Anything else is an effort to justify the moral  bankruptcy of 1991 and 1992, when this could have been  prevented. And everything is being repeated in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Russian entry into Sarajevo is the  definitive fall of Yalta, with the West losing 400 km of its  territory and the East gaining it. A weak Russia is dictating  policy while the West is wavering again. This is an  indiscretion, this failure to understand that the East is  approaching by very quick steps is a grave danger.    [Divjak] Let us return to the domestic scene. What is  happening to you in your party, Mr. HSLS vice chairman?    [Kramaric] In any party, especially a party that is on a  certain upswing, that wants to capture as much political room as  possible, it is inevitable that there will be certain  disagreements. I am a linguist by profession, and one of the  first rules of linguistics is that disagreement is a condition  of reaching agreement. That is the context in which I consider  the response to your question. There must be certain differences  in order to achieve any agreement.    [Divjak] What is the essence of the disagreement?    [Kramaric] It is very hard to come from Zagreb, Split,  Rijeka, Osijek, Cakovac, Varazdin, Koprivnica, Zadar, Sibenik;  you do not have the same views on some problems. This war, the  extremely motley quality of Croatia, heightened by these wartime  events, has slowly clouded our views. Something seems completely  normal from Zagreb's perspective, while from the perspective of  Osijek or Zadar-Sibenik it has a different look to it. I think  that fundamental disagreement should be sought here. Second, you  have patient and impatient people in any party.    A certain number of people in the HSLS may think that power  comes rolling by and you only have to bend over and pick it up.  I personally do not think that power is that weak, that it is  served up on a platter. On the contrary, I would like for the  political scene in Croatia to be stabilized and that one party  no longer receive more than 50 percent of the votes, that a  coalition-based, cooperative relationship be the foundation of  the future Croatia, both in the Assembly and in the government,  that we be forced to talk to each other and eliminate the amount  of animosity that exists. Governmental authority must be a  category of responsibility, not of strength. Sometimes my  colleagues on the city council tell me that they have the  impression that I am afraid of something, and I am in fact  afraid because I make decisions that could hurt someone, but I  do not want to hurt anyone. This principle of responsibility is  my fundamental principle, which guides me when I make decisions.  <H5>  Liberal Consensus </H5>   [Divjak] To what extent is that the majority principle in  your party?    [Kramaric] I hope that this will be well-emphasized here.  Although I am vice chairman, I am not very involved in making  important decisions on the party level. Are you commenting on  my, shall we say, indecision about what to do in the future? I  have not made being an Assembly deputy my profession, I have  retained my faculty position, and ultimately I am the mayor.  Although--and I can say this now--I grudgingly agreed to run for  office. At first I did not expect to win, I thought I was  lending my name to the liberals' impetus. But there was a big, I  would even say excessive, victory by the HSLS on the city level,  I succumbed to persuasion by people who said that I had to  assume power, although even then I thought differently, and  organize my life in the sense of working in the party, in the  Assembly, and at the university.    Thus, I am in a position to marginalize myself in relation  to  creating strategic projects in my own party, by my own will. But  I am satisfied with the work of the Grand Council, where  liberals from all over Croatia come together, and those  differences that emerged previously now emerge only in public.  And that does not have to be a bad thing. For now, it seems to  me that for certain views there are mild misunderstandings.  Second, many people forget the "S" in the name of the party,  which has a Christian democratic connotation, which shows that  the liberals are aware of the situation in which Croatia finds  itself. Not only because of the war, but also because of the  Bolshevik legacy that has left behind a number of social  problems that we would like to solve in a liberal fashion, but  with the very refined, Christian component of justice and  awareness of all hardships. Some people might say that this is a  contradiction, but I would say that it is an oxymoron, and I  like oxymorons.    [Divjak] Is it possible for us to speak of some leading  faction in the party? Whose positions are the strongest?    [Kramaric] I think that there is a general consensus among  all so-called factions on key issues. I try to be a person who  will be good with everyone and have understanding for everyone.  If you really want to know, I am closest to the government of  Gotovac, if I may say so and reveal that. There is a whole  series of sensible people there with whom we mostly agree, from  Budisa, Rados, and Granic to Butkovic....    [Divjak] You have listed almost everyone. With whom do you  not agree?    [Kramaric] I think that there are some, I might call them  techno-managerial components of the liberals whom I personally  feel are somewhat impatient and do not see the motley nature of  Croatia....    [Divjak] Whom do you mean concretely, Fizulic?    [Kramaric] Well, yes. Personally, I do not have poor  relations with Mr. Fizulic, but a few times he has made some  decisions--we said that we would be candid--that do not hold up.  Let there be no misunderstanding--he does not have a bad  concept, but he does not always do the best job in harmonizing  this concept with every Croatian concept. That is my most  precise response.  <H5>  President for 21st Century </H5>   [Divjak] Could the same thing that happened to the IDS  [Istrian Democratic Assembly] in Pula also happen to the HSLS in  May at the electoral assembly in Osijek?    [Kramaric] I think that we are in any event a serious party,  and if such signs were to appear then we would know how to reach  a gentlemen's agreement. To be precise, so you do not catch me,  I think that it cannot happen, but if there were certain  tendencies--and I say this only in the conditional--then we  would know how to resolve them through a gentlemen's agreement,  without amusing the Croatian public in that way.    [Divjak] Is Drazen Budisa remaining at the head of the  liberals?    [Kramaric] I think that he is. I must repeat this--I welcome  his candidacy as party chairman with sincere satisfaction. He is  a person, politician, and friend for whom I feel exceptional  esteem and with whom I have not had a single important  disagreement thus far. He is necessary to both the liberals and  Croatia, and he must complete the cycle that began with him.  That is good, whereby we too are aware of what we have  conditionally called the policy of a new course, that what  applied yesterday does not apply today. That there will be  adjustments in some of our positions toward current events, but  there will be no abandonment of the fundamental premises.    [Divjak] How then does this fit in with the appearance of  Zlatko Kramaric in the post of HSLS chairman for the 21st  century, and does he in fact want to be that?    [Kramaric] That should not be ruled out either. It is  possible that our turn will come in that regard if I continue to  offer good answers, good solutions in the concrete situation.  There is no reason for me not to assume that honor and  obligation. I am not running away from that, but I think that  this time, the 20th century and perhaps the 21st century as  well, if it does not turn out that I am giving Budisa a short  life span, must end with him. But anything is possible in the  21st century.    [Divjak] Does that mean that your concept of understanding  could have a place on the Croatian political scene?    [Kramaric] Once this time of triumph and tragedy that has  happened to us as a nation is over, people will have to start  behaving reasonably. We have paid dearly for a big school, and  we must draw some lessons from it. I think that the time is  coming for rational behavior, for the concept of cooperation, a  concept in which you do not regard political adversaries as  enemies, that the time of hatred is over. Because this amount of  hatred can be our undoing; I have always said that our political  conception will be drawn into question when we respond to the  hatred of others with hatred of our own. But unfortunately it  seems to me that on the current Croatian political scene, now  that we have lost our enemies, we are looking for new enemies,  that we are looking for them in our very midst, and that is what  distresses me very much and why I think that it is not good for  the future of Croatia.</p>

			<p>920111 FT  11 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Arbitrage deals push Nikkei down 3.2% INVESTMENT TRUST and futures-linked arbitrage selling pushed the Nikkei average down by 3.2 per cent yesterday, to the lowest level since the Bank of Japan's December 30 official discount rate cut, writes Neil Weinberg in Tokyo. The index closed 731.34 lower at 22,381.90, 2.6 per cent down on the week, after a day's high of 23,018.24 at the opening, and low of 22,203.03. Volume rose from 198m to 230m shares. Advances led declines 816 to 134 with 146 unchanged, the Topix index of all first-section issues fell 39.25 to 1,660.16 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 0.78 to 1,247.57. Prices fell sharply in the morning, under pressure from losses in March index futures prices, and there was continued selling from investment trusts facing widespread redemptions prior to their March 31 book-closing. City banks are bailing out of investment trusts and offsetting the losses with bond dealing gains, said Mr Yoichi Kamina, director of Japanese equity sales at SG Warburg Securities. Word that the Finance Ministry was holding discussions with various securities houses about the influence of futures arbitrage trading on the stock market also sparked concern that new restrictions could be forthcoming next week and further depressed the market, another trader said. High technology issues were broadly lower, with Toshiba down Y23 at Y612 and NEC Y40 at Y1,180. Drug companies were also off, with Daiichi Pharmaceutical losing Y80 to Y1,560 and Dainippon Pharmaceutical Y60 to Y1,440. NTT ended at the record low of Y720,000 touched twice last year. Kyocera gained Y110 to Y4,070 on prospects for lower losses than previously expected. Honda lost ground for the fourth consecutive day on a weak earnings outlook, ending off Y30 at Y1,390. In Osaka, the OSE average declined 370.25 to 23,661.41 on volume of 21m shares. Roundup THE REGION offered a mixed, but muted reaction to Tokyo's fall. HONG KONG registered another all-time high, gaining 14.38 to 4348.2 for a rise of 1 per cent on the week. Turnover climbed from HKDollars 1.44bn to HKDollars 2.15bn. Brokers said that fund managers were restructuring their portfolios by buying laggards such as Hutchison Whampoa and New World and dumping the over-bought banks. The heavy volume was attributed to good turnover in the active blue-chips, and overseas buying. AUSTRALIA's metals, mining, gold and resources shares, all relying largely on foreign exchange for their earnings, were aided by a fall in the Australian dollar and a stronger price for gold bullion. Industrials were little changed and oil and gas stocks lost ground in line with weak oil prices, but the All Ordinaries index still rose 6.0 to 1,668.0, 0.5 per cent higher on the week. The NEW ZEALAND dollar rose against its Australian counterpart and this left the NZSE-40 Index 1.21 lower at 1,518.35. SINGAPORE closed above the day's lows, but the Straits Times Industrial index still ended 2.44 lower at 1,488.07, fractionally higher on the week in quiet trading. SEOUL dropped 2.8 per cent on the day but just 0.8 per cent on the week as the composite index fell 17.64 to 619.47 after reports of foreign selling. TAIWAN saw profit-taking in heavy trading, and fell after eight rising sessions. The weighted index closed 20.69 lower at 4782.82 for a rise on the week of 5.3 per cent. Turnover rose from TDollars 38.4bn to TDollars 42.4bn. MANILA was encouraged by Thursday's rise in Philippine Long Distance Telephone on the American Stock Exchange in New York and the composite index advanced 11.74 to 1,219.83, fractionally down on the week. BANGKOK took losses in most shares but Bangkok Bank was heavily bought for the second day and its gain pushed the stock index to a higher close. Bangkok Bank rose Bt2 to Bt522 with Bt1.29bn of shares changing hands, equal to 26.5 per cent of the total market turnover. The SET index ended 1.93 higher at 727.63 on turnover of Bt4.84bn.</p>

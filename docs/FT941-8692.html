			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Arts: Today's Television Friday nights are heavy on comedy and gardening. The BBC is currently offering repeats of Only Fools And Horses where Del has plans for a satellite TV company (8.00 BBC1); Red Dwarf, which now moves on to Series II and introduces its best character, the robot Kryten (9.00 BBC2); and Blackadder II, in which Blackadder and Lord Melchett are kidnapped (10.00 BBC2). On Channel 4 there is also Roseanne for those who find defensive/aggressive fat people funny; and a new series of The Jack Dee Show with the stand-up comedian who is now best known for the 'widget' beer commercial (10.30). Channel 4's repeat of the series Nature Perfected looks at Italian gardens from the Renaissance onwards (9.00). As that ends BBC2 begins a new series of Gardeners' World (9.30). Items include a dried herbaceous border created by gardening photographer Andrew Lawson. Friday is also film night. Best bet is the Clint Eastwood western High Plains Drifter (10.20 BBC1) which, even in 1972, had all the violence and vague supernaturalism that became Eastwood's trademarks.</p>

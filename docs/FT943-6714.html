			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Lib Dems plan NHS 'rationing' The Liberal Democrats are considering a system of healthcare 'rationing' which would make non-essential cosmetic and fertility treatments difficult or impossible to obtain on the National Health Service. The idea is floated in a consultation paper to be published on Monday by the party's health policy working group. The paper says informal rationing is already operating in the health service, mainly through long waiting lists for certain kinds of treatment, but there is a case for 'rational priority setting' of the kind introduced in some US states and New Zealand. It suggests treatment priorities could be established through public consultation after the costs and benefits had been clarified by medical experts. It does not say which conditions might cease to be covered, but the working party is understood to have focused on areas such as tattoo removal and advanced fertility treatments. Priority setting would be accompanied by a shift of NHS resources into preventive healthcare, combined with a health tax and 'transparent' NHS accounting to show the annual costs of different forms of treatment. Members of the working party believe this would increase public pressure for a reduction in 'self-inflicted' illnesses such as those caused by smoking.</p>

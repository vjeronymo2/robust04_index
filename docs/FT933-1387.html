			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Defeated city counts its blessings: Government pledges support if Manchester bids for Olympics Games in 2004 WILL Manchester try again by bidding for the 2004 games? 'If the British Olympic Committee decide to opt for Manchester next time, I will certainly be with them,' Mr Robert Key, the environment minister, said last night. 'What the committee decides is up to them. All I can do is pledge the British government's support in the future.' Mr John Major, the prime minister, said last night that he would 'most certainly' like to see a British bid for 2004. Speaking outside 10 Downing Street on his return from speaking to the International Olympic Committee in Monte Carlo, he said that it was for Manchester to decide whether to make a third attempt. 'I can only say I don't think they could have presented the bid better,' he added. 'They may well wish to try again.' Mr Craig Reedie, British Olympic Association chairman, said it was too soon to decide whether or not to bid for the games in 2004. 'We have until March 1996 before any decision is taken and that gives us a little time to think about it,' he said. If our national Olympic committee is very keen to go again, we'll have to look at all applications.' Meanwhile Mr Key joined in the general, sometimes tearful, disappointment at Manchester Town Hall, where about 600 of north-west England's political, business and community leaders had gathered to watch the events in Monte Carlo. In spite of the result, people were generally counting their blessings: a new velodrome - Britain's first national cycling stadium - and an international-class arena which is already sparking redevelopment around it that should extend and enhance Manchester's city centre. The world cycling championships will be held in the city in 1996. KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm, has put the benefit of the new facilities, plus environmental improvements to go with them and the act of bidding itself, at Pounds 200m of investment and 480 jobs. The government has put up about Pounds 75m of the money. Mr Key said the bid had developed a new means and spirit of co-operation between central government and the private sector which was proving an important spur to urban regeneration. 'We could not have done anything more to win,' Mr Key added, echoing a widespread feeling among the bidding team that Manchester's bid was the best Britain could do. Their team yesterday included Mr Major, the Princess Royal, political and business leaders and sporting stars. Manchester was making its second bid for the Olympics, having knocked Birmingham out of bidding for the 1996 Games and beaten London to carry the flag in yesterday's race. It had a series of good selling points: wholehearted government support; a guarantee by Mr Major that costs would be met; an athlete's village within walking distance of most of the events; Britain's position as a stable democracy; the country's best regional transportation infrastructure of roads, railways and airport, and good telecommunications. Mr Scott's team persuaded 79 of the IOC's 91 members to visit Manchester - more than went to any other bidding city. After Atlanta won the race for 1996, Mr Sebastian Coe, a double Olympic gold medallist runner and now a Tory MP, said only London had enough status and prestige to win for Britain. Last night Amec, the construction company leading the consortium to build Manchester's Olympic stadium, said there was a groundswell of support for a world-class stadium in the city. 'Although there is no commitment to fund a stadium now Manchester has lost the bid, Amec will work hard . . . to bring forward construction proposals, albeit a smaller version of the current design,' the company said.</p>

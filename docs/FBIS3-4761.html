			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, February 28 (KCNA) -- The great leader  President Kim Il-song published the famous work "Theses on the  Socialist Rural Question in Our Country," the chuche-based  programme of socialist rural construction, on Feb. 25, 1964, and  has wisely led the work to carry it into reality.    He visited many rural communities throughout the country to  teach the officials of the rural economy and the agricultural  working people how to do farming and manage the farms.    After the publication of the theses, President Kim Il-song  convened national agricultural conferences and meetings of  agricultural officials on scores of occasions and guided the  agricultural working people to effect an epoch-making turn in  socialist rural construction.    Vigorous efforts to implement the theses over the past  thirty  years resulted in the completion of irrigation and  electrification of agriculture on a high level and fulfilment of  the tasks of mechanization and wide use application of chemicals.    In recent years grand projects of harnessing nature, among  them the building of the West Sea barrage and of waterways  extending 800 kilometres in the western areas have successfully  been carried out to complete the irrigation of agriculture at a  high level.    28.7 percent of paddy and non-paddy fields had been  irrigated  before the publication of the theses. But all the cultivated  lands in plain, intermediary and mountainous areas have been  irrigated today.    Electrification of agriculture has also been completed on a  high level.    In a few years after the publication of the theses  electricity found its way into all the rural villages and  cooperative farms of the country and to all the farm houses as  lighting, power and heating energies. The annual consumption of  electricity in the countryside today increased 8.6 times the  1963 figure.    The task to mechanize agriculture has been fulfilled. Over  the past thirty years the number of the tractors and lorries  serving agriculture has increased 6 and 5 times respectively.  Now all the farm work from ploughing to sowing,  rice-transplanting, weeding, harvesting, threshing and transport  are done with the help of machines.    The task of extensive application of chemicals to  agriculture  has been carried out. The amount of the chemical fertilizers  supplied to each hectare was 300 kilogrammes in 1963 and it has  shown a rise of more than two tons at present.    The output of grain has leaped 1.9 times the figure of the  time when the theses was published, of which rice 1.8 times and  maize 2.2 times.    With tens of thousands of public service establishments  built  in the rural villages, the farmers live without any worry.    Regular agricultural universities and colleges and farm  colleges and study-while-you-work training centres of various  forms for training technicians have been set up in provinces.    The number of the technicians and experts who serve for  socialist rural construction has increased more than ten times  the figure before the publication of the theses.    Ideal communist villages has made their appearance in  Chongsan- ri, Kangso District, in Yongrim-ri, Mundok County, in  Changdong-ri, Sukchon County, in Oguk-ri, Anak County, in  Wangjaesan-ri, Onsong County, and other places of the country.    Houses built at the state expense have been distributed to  the farmers free of charge, leaving not a person homeless.    Korea's countryside has turned into a modern socialist  community and the standard of the farmers' living has reached  the level of well-to-do middle peasants in the past days.</p>

			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / UK Company News: Laura Ashley back with Pounds 1.8m but passes dividend LAURA ASHLEY, the international clothing and home furnishings group, yesterday reported its first pre-tax profit since 1989, in spite of a management shake-up which resulted in a large operating loss in its US division. The group, which sees itself as a 'lifestyle brand' rather than a retailer, made a profit of Pounds 1.8m before tax for the year to January 30, compared with a Pounds 9.1m loss after restructuring costs last time. Earnings were 0.34p (3.86p losses) but the company once again decided that it was 'prudent' to pass its dividend. 'Whilst it's only a modest profit, it's obviously a milestone,' said Mr Jim Maxmin, the American who became chief executive in 1991. But Mr Maxmin said Laura Ashley's performance did not reflect a general pick-up in high street sales, where he claimed the improvement experienced by some retailers was due to heavy discounting. Turnover fell to Pounds 248m (Pounds 263m), but Mr Maxmin said this reflected the group's concentration on building gross margins rather than turnover. A reorganisation of its US division, including cutting buying to reduce a large stock surplus, led to the virtual collapse of its haphazard distribution system, and the division plunged to a Pounds 6.9m operating loss. But Mr Maxmin insisted yesterday that the problems in the US were operational, rather than problems with the Laura Ashley brand. He was determined to bring them under control by the end of the year, using the same 'Simplify, Focus, Act' formula employed in the UK and Europe. The US loss contributed to a Pounds 2m reduction in group operating profits to Pounds 1.1m. Profits from associated businesses also declined from Pounds 1.9m to Pounds 1.5m, reflecting the high costs of opening shops in Asia, which are carried by Laura Ashley's Japanese joint venture. But interest payments fell from Pounds 2.4m to Pounds 0.8m. Operating profits in the UK retail business improved from Pounds 1.4m to Pounds 5.6m. A strong turnround in the second half saw garment sales increase 3 per cent, following a 14 per cent fall in the first half. Sales in the current year were running some 30 per cent ahead of last year, Mr Maxmin said. Furnishings sales grew in the second half for the first time since 1988, and were currently 9 per cent ahead. In Europe, like-for-like sales - which exclude those in newly-opened stores  -improved 12 per cent for garments and 4 per cent for furnishings. See Lex</p>

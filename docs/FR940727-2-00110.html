The complete application may be obtained for a fee from the SEC's Public Reference Branch. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicant's Representations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Applicant is a non-diversified open-end management investment company organized as a Washington corporation. On August 23, 1990, applicant registered under section 8(a) of the Act and filed a registration statement under section 8(b) of the Act and the Securities Act of 1933. The registration statement was declared effective and applicant commenced its initial public offering on February 7, 1991.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. According to applicant's Combined Proxy Statement/Prospectus dated February 16, 1994, in January 1994, First Albany Asset Management Corporation (``First Albany''), applicant's investment adviser, entered into an asset purchase agreement (the ``Asset Purchase Agreement'') with Key Trust Company (``Key Trust''). Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, Key Trust would acquire substantially all of the assets of First Albany related to the management of applicant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Consummation of the Asset Purchase Agreement was conditioned upon applicant's Board of Directors approving the plan of reorganization described below. On January 10, 1994, applicant's Board of Directors approved a plan of reorganization whereby application agreed to transfer substantially all of its assets and certain of its liabilities to the Victory NY Tax-Free Portfolio (the ``Acquiring Fund''), a newly-created series of The Victory Fund in exchange for shares of the Acquiring Fund. According to the Combined Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the Board of Directors determined that the facilities and resources of Key Trust would be a benefit to applicant and its shareholders. The Board of Directors also determined, among other things, that the opportunity to exchange shares of applicants for shares of the other 11 portfolios of the Victory Fund would be an added advantage to applicant's shareholders.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Proxy materials related to the reorganization were filed with the SEC and distributed to shareholders on or about February 28, 1994. On April 22, 1994, holders of more than two-thirds of the outstanding voting shares of applicant approved the reorganization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. On April 30, 1994, applicant had 1,782,572 shares outstanding and total net assets of $22,795,947 and a net asset value per share of $12.79. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. As of April 30, 1994, applicant transferred substantially all of its assets and certain of its liabilities to the Acquiring Fund in exchange for full and fractional shares of the Acquiring Fund. Each of applicant's shareholders received as a liquidating distribution shares of the Acquiring Fund in the same dollar amount as the shares of applicant held by such shareholder immediately prior to the effective date of the reorganization, plus the right to receive any unpaid dividends or distributions declared before the effective time of the reorganization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. The cost of preparing, filing, and distributing registration and proxy materials necessary to obtain shareholder approval of the reorganization was borne by the Acquiring Fund's and applicant's managers. No cost of the reorganization was borne by applicant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. As of the date of the application, applicant had retained $3,630 in cash to pay its remaining liabilities. Applicant has no shareholders. Applicant is not a party to any litigation or administrative proceeding. Applicant is not presently engaged in, nor does it propose to engage in, any business activities other than those necessary for the winding up of its affairs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9.

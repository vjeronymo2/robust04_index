			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Mates refuses to resign over links with Nadir: Major infuriated by claims about funding of Tory party MR JOHN MAJOR last night faced a fresh test of his authority when the minister at the centre of the row over Tory links with fugitive businessman Mr Asil Nadir made clear he would not resign. As the prime minister and Sir Norman Fowler, Tory party chairman, reacted angrily to the latest allegations over undisclosed donations to the Tory party, Mr Michael Mates, Northern Ireland minister, said: 'I have done nothing wrong.' Signalling that he hoped to brazen out calls to resign, Mr Mates said the prime minister had expressed 'full confidence' in him - though Mr Major's support has been less than wholehearted. At the European Community summit in Copenhagen, Mr Major gave the impression he would be ready to accept Mr Mates' resignation but was reluctant to sack him. The prime minister stuck to the line that Mr Mates had been guilty of misjudgment but not 'a hanging offence'. The reaction of senior Tory MPs today and tomorrow is likely to determine Mr Mates' fate. Many had been urging him to resign after revelations about a watch he gave to Mr Nadir and the loan of a car by a public relations adviser working for the head of the collapsed Polly Peck business empire. However the 1922 committee executive of backbench Tories could decide to rally behind Mr Mates in an attempt to avoid undermining Mr Major's leadership or leaving him vulnerable to charges of indecision. In Copenhagen, Mr Major denounced as 'fantasy' reports that the Conservatives had accepted contributions from the Saudi royal family and rejected calls from opposition MPs that the party reveal the names of donors. Last night, a Labour MP used parliamentary privilege to quote from a letter naming Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, as having met a Saudi prince before the last election to discuss aid to the Tories. But earlier Mr Major did little to disguise his anger at allegations about contributors to Tory funds. Newspapers should provide evidence for the charges or 'stop printing them', he said. Referring to a Guardian report that a Saudi royal family member had contributed several million pounds to the Tories just before the last election, he insisted: 'The Conservative party does not accept money from foreign governments or from royal families and has not done so.' Clearly enraged about the continuing suggestions that the party was funded through much of the 1980s from questionable sources, Mr Major offered another hint that it was preparing to pay back money given to the Tories by Mr Nadir. Mr Major rejected the principle of state funding of political parties, as urged by the Labour party. But he insisted: 'In the event that any money handed to us is found to be tainted we will return that money.' Separately, Sir Norman used a Commons debate on financing of political parties to attack Touche Ross, liquidators to Polly Peck, for taking two years to reply to a letter from Conservative Central Office on Mr Nadir's Pounds 440,000 of donations and for leaking information to Sunday newspapers. Prince Bandar bin Sultan, Saudi ambassador to the US, said he was considering legal action against The Guardian for a report yesterday that he authorised a Pounds 7m donation to Tory funds.

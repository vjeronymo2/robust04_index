			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Inna Rozanova: "A Bitter Mixture from the </F> Barbaric Market: How Hucksters Do Business in Medicines"]    [Text] Panadol, fever-reducing tablets--3,000 rubles [R],  Neo-angin for the throat--6,000, Galazolin for a cold--1,000,  the cough mixture Bronkholitin--2,500. Such are the prices for  medicines for the common cold in pharmacies of the capital today.    But what about people with more serious maladies? Where are  they to get this money during the times of this wild market and  the merciless prices of medicines? After all, even the most  ordinary No-Shpa now costs R3,000-4,000, the stomach preparation  Festal--28,000, Nootropil for improving the memory--26,000,  Moditen, a preparation with a psychotropic effect--R40,000, and  the antitumor preparation Ziniristin--R117,000. There are even  more costly medicines--for the antitumor preparation  Litoksantron they are asking more than R2 million.    Are such prices always justified? State controller-price  setters, conducting planned inspections throughout the country,  state: There are now too many people in Russia wanting to line  their pockets at the expense of those who are ill.    The most expensive medicines in our country are imported.  State procurements through imports used to be subsidized from  the budget and the prices were relatively low. Now the subsidies  have been abolished. The state regulates only the level of the  trade markup, but the price asked by Western firms or buyers is  determined by supply and demand.    Many of the former domestic medicines have become imports.  Plants on the territory of the Soviet Union specialized in  particular kinds of medications. Now more than two-thirds of  these plants are outside the Russian Federation.    In order to put a stop to energetic people who make a  business out of pharmaceuticals and thus to protect the  population from arbitrary prices, the government has adopted a  decision to regulate prices of medicines. The rules of the game  are very simple: Domestic manufacturing enterprises must deliver  medicines to wholesalers at a price no more than the production  cost plus 30 percent. In turn, pharmacies have been ordered to  sell the preparations to the population at no more than 1.5  times the wholesale factory price of the producer.    It is only possible to verify the correctness of the price  in  each specific case. It sometimes happens that at neighboring  pharmacies the prices for the same medicine differ severalfold,  but there can be quite legitimate reasons for this. After all,  although domestic producers also work "under scrutiny" of the  state, with a restriction on profitability, they still purchase  raw materials at free prices, including through exchanges.  Therefore batches of one and the same medicine from one and the  same plant, even if they are produced only a couple of days  apart, can have completely different factory wholesale prices.    According to the law the penalty for exceeding the trade  markup is paid by the pharmacy--the last link in the commercial  chain. It most frequently happens that the pharmacies are left  with the last little bits of the total markup. As a result it  turns out that this trading point is not able to pay its  expenses. The majority of pharmacies in the country operate at a  loss and local administrative organs have to cover their costs.  But since the local administration does not always have enough  money for this, the real prices of the medicines in pharmacies  frequently exceed the amounts of the established markups.    When it comes to the northern and remote regions of the  country that are accessible only by aircraft, this is a special  problem. Transportation costs of delivering medicines there  sometimes turn out to be several times higher than the factory  wholesale price of the manufacturing plant. Local authorities  must deal with this problem as well. For example, the Council of  Ministers of the Republic of Komi, arbitrarily and with the  consent of its Supreme Soviet, permitted them to apply free  trade markups of an average of up to 300 percent. And the  government of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia), conversely,  established and introduced fixed retail prices for 260 kinds of  medicines. This means that in Yakutia pharmacies are subsidized  from the local budget.    But Yakutia and Komi are special regions, the local  authorities are not asleep at the wheel there, they have the  situation under control. It is another matter when individual  pharmacies apply arbitrary trade markups without permission and  thus profit from those who are suffering. For example, BAZL, a  small enterprise that is a limited liability partnership from  Bratsk in Irkutsk Oblast, when selling medicines applied an  arbitrary trade markup of from 200 to 1,500 percent. As a  result, in just a half year the total excess of prices amounted  to more than R2 million.    As was discovered as a result of a state inspection, the  Zelenograd pharmacy from a satellite city of the capital by the  same name sold the medicine Novopassit at 23 times the wholesale  price, and pharmacy No. 422 from the same population point  "gladdened" the buyers of the preparation Nikodin by exceeding  the factory wholesale price as much as 29-fold.    An inspection of one-tenth of the Moscow pharmacy network  showed that 70 percent of the pharmacies are violating the law  by applying trade markups in excess of the maximum level. As a  result of this the population was overcharged more than R16  million.    There is no doubt that the pharmacies, like the producers of  the medicines, are having to return their illegally obtained  profit and are being fined in the same amount.    The deliberate raising of the trade markup by the pharmacies  is only the most primitive of all the possible financial tricks.  Much more clever machinations can occur in any of the links of  the trade chain, including at the level of the  intermediary-wholesalers. For example, the joint venture  Panta-Vitamin was created in July 1993 in order to sell products  of the Moscow Endocrine Plant. This plant was one of the  founders and, a month later, by August, 82 percent of all the  products produced by the plant were sold through the joint  venture. By raising the prices of medicines over such a short  period of time the schemers from Panta-Vitamin were able to  overcharge the pharmacies a total of R2.5 million, the  wholesalers--R176.4 million, and private individuals--R29,200.  In addition to the fine the price controllers made the  Panta-Vitamin joint venture pay R357.8 million into the budget.    Machinations are also possible against a background of  privatization and the founding of "fake" joint-stock companies.  The manager of pharmacy No. 477 in the city of Zelenograd, N.  Suvorova, and her accomplices, illegally, without consent from  the Moscow Government, decided to change the  organizational-legal form of the institution entrusted to her,  forming the Central Pharmacy joint-stock company. At the same  time the energetic manager founded another joint-stock company,  on the same premises, but with a different name--Vitafarm. The  business was organized, as it were, simply but tastefully. A  one-sided "exchange" of goods took place between these  joint-stock companies. Central Pharmacy, receiving medicines  that were in critical short supply with subsidies from the  budget, turned them over to Vitafarm--and here they were not shy  about jacking up the prices as far as they would go.    True, frequently the pharmacies had to violate the law by  not  requiring their suppliers to indicate the prices of the  manufacturing plants in the payment documents. This happens when  medicines that are in critically short supply are offered to  them by exchanges or intermediaries working with foreign goods.  They give only their final price. And what they pay the  manufacturer for the goods--this is their trade secret.    Frequently the medical workers themselves try to feather  their nests from medicines, operating according to the principle  "what they do not know will not hurt them." How do prescription  medications end up in the bags of those people who are selling  them directly at the doors to the pharmacies? There are plenty  of "loopholes" for underhanded people.    What ways of lowering the cost of medicines are suggested by  experts from the former Russian State Committee on Prices? They  think that it is undoubtedly necessary for the state to monitor  the prices of manufacturing plants and the level of markups for  the trade network. Fines should be imposed not only on  enterprises and organizations that violate the price-setting  procedure but also on specific officials who contribute to these  violations. This right has been granted to organs for monitoring  prices by the Law of the Russian Federation "On Making Changes  and Additions to Legislative Acts of the Russian Federation in  Connection with Clarifying Liability for Illegal Trade."  Specialists recommend that the pharmacies switch to direct  deliveries of medications from the production plants--but this  is difficult right now, especially in outlying areas. The fact  that the pharmacies do not have enough of their own funds to  purchase medicines and the high cost of bank credit are also  unsolved problems.    Until we manage to beat inflation we will remain far away  from the ideal system of prices for medications that exists in  developed countries. There prices of medications are fixed--this  is linked mainly to medical insurance. The cost of the  medications included on the "insurance list" is balanced between  supply and demand.    There is no doubt that at this point our state is capable of  helping purchase medicines only for disabled persons, veterans,  and other underprivileged citizens by granting them the  opportunity to obtain medicine free of charge or with a  considerable rebate. But this certainly does not mean that  anybody can take advantage of our problems to feather their  nests.</p>

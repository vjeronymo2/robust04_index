Becirovic: "Zhirinovskiy: There Will Be No </F> Bombing of Serbian Towns"]    [Text] "Do you believe that NATO will indeed attack the  Serbs from the air?" Vladimir Zhirinovskiy was asked today at a  news conference.    "This will not happen. They only want to affect the morale  of  the Serbs by threatening them. And if that should happen, there  is a group of Russian officers in Europe who support me. They  would use a secret weapon, unused thus far, which destroys any  force in the air and on the ground, in order to cool off the  Western heads that threaten attacks on peaceful towns in Bosnia.  There will be no bombing whatsoever because they know very well  how Napoleon and Hitler fared, and if they do not know we will  once again show them," Zhirinovskiy said.    Asked what he thought about independent Montenegro, Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy stated that he believes that there should be two to  three Orthodox states in the Balkans and that he opposes the  creation of small states. "The West wants to introduce this in  the Balkans in order to partition them. Because it wants to  divide the Balkans: With Catholicism from the west and Turkey in  the east, and the Germans would arrive from the north, Turkish  and German would be spoken in the Balkans by the middle of the  21st century. It will not be able to do so because the Balkans  are the land of Orthodoxy, where Serbian and Russian will be  spoken," Vladimir Zhirinovskiy predicts. Speaking about the  strategy of the West, Zhirinovskiy also said the following: "The  time will come when the Western politicians will be standing in  line so that I may receive them."    Otherwise, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, who came to Montenegro at  the invitation of the Russian-Serbian Friendship Society, the  Serbian National Renewal, and the Social Democratic Party of  Montenegro, also talked this morning with a group of  representatives of some opposition parties and was received by  the secretary of the Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS),  Svetozar Marovic. According to the information issued by  Marovic's office, the guest was informed of the DPS efforts to  resolve the conflict in the territory of the former Yugoslavia  in a peaceful and democratic way, because the people are tired  of wars and conflicts.    "We must fight for our religion, our spirit, and our mind in  order to survive in this area. This is why we do this today as  well, in spite of all the injustices, pressures, and decisions  of the West. We remember that the Russian people were with us in  the past, and they are with us today in spite of all the  tribulations, and we expect to be together in the defense of  what is ours," Marovic said.    Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, strongly praising the contribution of  the DPS in the resolution of the crisis in the territory of the  former Yugoslavia, stressed that "the Russian policy in this  respect did not always correspond adequately to the expectations  of the peoples of Serbia and Montenegro," that the policy of his  party consists of supporting the Slavs and resolving problems  through peaceful means, and that his party will actively  participate in the resolution of the crisis and do everything in  order for the sanctions to be lifted as soon as possible.    At exactly 1300 hours in Ivan Milutinovic Square in  Podgorica, a large assembly was held at which more than 1,000  citizens were present. Greeted enthusiastically with shouts  "Russians, Russians" and posters, saying, for example,  "Priyekhal Petr Velikiy" [Russian for "Peter the Great has  arrived"], Vladimir Zhirinovskiy addressed the citizens: "We do  not threaten anyone, but one should know what Russian tanks and  Russian airplanes are and who was the first to fly into the  cosmos. Brother Serbs, Montenegrins, be proud to be Orthodox. We  are both spiritually and economically richer. If they are  forming the European Gommunity from London to Vienna, we will  form the Eastern European Community from Knin to Crimea."    Offering all possible aid, as he said, to the heroic Serbian  people, Zhirinovskiy added: "On Saturday, 5 February, I will  personally organize a meeting in support of the Serbian people,  and I will ask in the sharpest way in the Russian parliament for  the resignation of minister-traitor Kozyrev."    "Only a short time remains before the leadership in Russia  is  removed. We will force it to remove the blockade in Yugoslavia  and find a way to compensate the Serbs for the material losses  they have suffered. We are obligated to take care of you more  than anyone else. Let the war move on to Latin America, Africa,  and the Far East," Zhirinovskiy said, among other things, at  today's meeting in Podgorica, which was in a way spontaneous,  because it was announced only late last night.</p>

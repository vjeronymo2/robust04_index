			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / International Company News: Fairview in mortgage move Cadillac Fairview, one of Canada's biggest commercial property groups, will halt mortgage payments on at least six troubled properties to conserve cash and speed a financial restructuring. Fairview owns 74 large properties in Canada and the US, mainly shopping centres, and including Toronto's downtown Eaton Centre and Vancouver's Pacific Centre. The last two are generating enough cash to cover debt payments. Fairview was sold by the Montreal Bronfman family in 1987 to Chicago's JMB Realty and 41 institutions. Since 1990 it has been hit by steeply falling property values, lower rents and rising vacancies. It owes CDollars 2.2bn (USDollars 1.64bn) on individual properties and has CDollars 11bn of corporate debt. A week ago Fairview said it was negotiating a restructuring with shareholders and lenders and was considering asset sales and a public share issue. Mr Graeme Eadie, president, said as an interim measure Fairview would segregate cash flow and liabilities for each of its 62 Canadian properties. Hitherto revenues were pooled and cash flow from one property could support others. Interest and principal to mortgage holders and joint owners would be limited to actual cash flow generated by an individual property, while trade creditors would continue to be paid fully, Mr Eadie explained. It means that Fairview could risk foreclosure attempts, analysts said. Fairview is in talks with its lenders to obtain new financing to complete the restructuring. The Toronto Dominion Bank is agent for the lenders.</p>

Drawing from the IoM study on nursing homes, which criticized the large numbers of facilities that fluctuated between compliance and noncompliance, the Act is designed to impose alternative sanctions swiftly once noncompliance is identified as a means of spurring facilities to correct deficiencies more rapidly than might otherwise be the case. While this may prove costly to those facilities that find themselves subject to such sanctions, this is a cost that the Congress obviously anticipated and concluded was necessary to assure high quality care for program beneficiaries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 488.456&blank;Termination of Provider Agreement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters argued that the proposed regulations rely too heavily upon termination as a remedy. These commenters feel that termination should be used as a last resort and only where other remedies have failed or where the building is unsafe. In addition, some of these commenters want to consider the effect of termination on residents (transfer trauma) and a few of them go further to recommend that the regulations prohibit the use of termination unless immediate jeopardy to residents is present and only after everything else has failed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One of the main goals of the proposed enforcement regulations was to increase the number of remedies available to HCFA and the States in order to ensure compliance with the health and safety requirements. We believe that implementation of these final regulations will accomplish that goal. While we will encourage the use of alternative sanctions, we firmly believe that provider agreement terminations may be appropriate in certain cases of noncompliance whether or not deficiencies pose immediate jeopardy to residents. We, too, are concerned about the potential harm to residents when they are required to move from a facility. For this reason, the regulations are designed to provide HCFA and the State survey agency with the ability to target noncompliance with appropriate remedies to assure compliance with the least disruption to residents and the facility. We cannot, however, restrict the use of termination to immediate jeopardy situations. Sections 1819(a)(3) and 1919(a)(3) of the Act require that a facility meet all of the statutory participation requirements to be considered a SNF or a NF, respectively (in other words, participate in either Medicare or Medicaid). While we have explained elsewhere why it is justifiable to consider substantial compliance as acceptable, the Act does not limit the above provisions by allowing indefinite noncompliance in non-immediate jeopardy situations. Indeed, sections 1819(h)(2)(C) and 1919(h)(3)(D) of the Act only permit continuation of Federal payments to facilities with non-immediate jeopardy deficiencies for a maximum of 6 months, and then only if certain criteria are met. Continuation of payment after 6 months is only permissible if substantial compliance has been achieved. Further, section 1919(h)(7)(A)(i) reinforces the 6 months maximum for participation for a noncompliant SNF.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter recommended that HCFA create a conditional waiver, not to exceed two years, that would apply to all physical environment requirements. The commenter recognized that no period of correction may exceed the 6-month limitation but pointed out that it may be physically impossible to correct structural deficiencies within that timeframe. Such correction may necessitate applications for bank loans and certificate of need approval; moreover, the construction season is limited by geographical location. The commenter believed that creation of conditional waiver not to exceed two years, for physical environment requirements, would allow facilities to continue to participate legitimately while correcting problems that the facility cannot correct within the 6-month period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We agree that some physical environment deficiencies may take longer to correct than others and that these deficiencies may not be wholly corrected within 6 months of the last day of the survey. However, as we have discussed previously, facilities must meet the standard of ``substantial compliance'' in order to continue participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. To meet the standard of ``substantial compliance'', deficiencies must be such that they cause no harm or potential for more than minimal harm. Although we have no desire to terminate facilities that are otherwise providing good quality of care, we believe that facilities have had ample time to comply with these requirements. Physical environment requirements have been in place since October 1990. Moreover, this regulation will not become effective until 6 months after the first day of the month after the regulation is published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , so facilities will have even more time to comply.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

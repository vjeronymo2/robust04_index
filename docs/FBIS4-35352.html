			<p>BFN     [Text] A responsible military source at the Armed Forces  Command of the Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY] has ridiculed  the lies spooned out by the information kitchen of the al-Ahmar  family to the news media, the latest of which were what was  reported by MENA that the artillery of the forces of the  al-Ahmar gang were positioned 14 km from Aden from where it was  said to be shelling Aden International Airport.    In a statement to the Yemeni news agency, the military  source  said the report was not only absolutely untrue, but it was  further evidence of the bankruptcy of the media of the Sanaa  gang and a reflection of its political and military bankruptcy.  Indeed, its lies will fluctuate within a day or two.    The source went on to say: We wish to confirm for the 20th  time that the fighting is taking place in between the two parts  of Yemen, hundreds of kilometers away from Aden. The foreign  journalists, let alone the residents of Aden, can confirm that.    The military source concluded its statement differentiates  between artillery shelling and missiles. The military source  also advised the foreign news media to be precise and seek  information from reliable sources instead of from the  information kitchen of the adventurous al-Ahmar family.</p>

			<p><P> January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE FOOTBALL: THE BOWL GAMES;  </P> <P> IT HAS BEEN QUITE A REIGN FOR DUKE;  </P> <P> BIG TEN COMMISSIONER WILL RETIRE WHEN A REPLACEMENT IS CHOSEN  </P> <P> One of Wayne Duke's most prized possessions is the clipping from Sports  Illustrated that pictures him with John Wayne at the Rose parade. John Wayne  sent him the clipping and signed it, "To Wayne Duke from Duke Wayne."  </P> <P> Wayne Duke, commissioner of the Big Ten, smiles when he tells about that  now-fading momento.  </P> <P> So you see, Duke does have some fond memories of the annual trip he has made to  California for the Rose Bowl every year for the past 18 years. But ask him  about the highlights and lowlights of his New Year's Day ritual and he gives  that familiar Wayne Duke grimace.  </P> <P> He had been in town less than 3 hours Wednesday and he had already been asked  why the Big Ten can't win the Rose Bowl.  </P> <P> Since announcing his retirement last summer, a retirement that will become  effective in the upcoming year when a successor is chosen, Duke has had plenty  of opportunities to review his tenure as leader of the Big Ten.  </P> <P> The conference boasts the largest football and basketball attendance in the  country, and that comes from winning a lot of games.  </P> <P> Duke was chairman of the NCAA basketball tournament committee that expanded the  field to 64 teams and upped the TV rights so that the tournament now brings in  about $55 million.  </P> <P> Duke was on the committee that put together a $103 million TV package between  the Big Ten and the Rose Bowl that will run through 1997.  </P> <P> The Rose Bowl game is truly dear to his heart. Duke has always been able to  refer to the game as "the granddaddy of them all" without cracking a smile at  the corny sound. He believes it.  </P> <P> It's a traditional matchup, and Duke believes that college football should be  more traditional, should match schools and school spirits for the pride and the  memories and the glory, not an abstract No. 1 and No. 2 for a mythical title.  </P> <P> "You can have a 'national championship' game in Phoenix this year, or, from  time to time, in Miami, but this game will be sold out year after year after  year," Duke said.  </P> <P> The Rose Bowl is his kind of college football.  </P> <P> Walter Byers, the longtime executive director of the NCAA, now retired, who  strongly influenced Duke during his early years in the NCAA office, told the  Chicago Tribune: "We both came from the romantic era in sports. Emphasis was  placed on values to be learned from the game. You competed because you enjoyed  it."  </P> <P> While he can get quite philosophical about the over-emphasis on winning and  losing, even at the level of eighth-grade soccer his grandson plays, Duke  cannot deny the impact it has on him to have to see his teams lose.  </P> <P> "I go in the dressing rooms," Duke said. "I try to go to our team's dressing  room after any game I see in the conference. I always go down after the Rose  Bowl game. And there's a disappointment in there after a loss. People who are  critical of our bowl record, or even people who are critical of the team's  performance that day, don't have to see, first hand, the terrible  disappointment that is felt by the players and the coaches who have put so much  into the game.  </P> <P> "The guy up in the stands who has been tailgating all day and who thinks he has  all the answers, doesn't have to see what losing does to the players and the  coaches."  </P> <P> Or what it does to Duke, who has come back up to the pressbox looking so  distressed that writers have joked about keeping an eye on him so he doesn't  jump from the roof.  </P> <P> Duke tries to keep smiling. "Tom Hansen (commissioner of the Pacific 10) tells  me I'm a very good loser," Duke said. "I tell him, that's because I've had a  lot of practice."  </P> <P> But it doesn't get easier.  </P> <P> As he flipped through the pages of his memories, Duke could not seem to  separate good times and bad times in Southern California from the wins and the  losses.  </P> <P> "I'll tell you the contrast," Duke said. "The first year we were here and  something that happened just last year make a good contrast."  </P> <P> The first year Duke and his wife, Martha, came out for the Rose Bowl game,  Stanford beat Michigan. It was after the 1971 season.  </P> <P> For the Duke family, it was an emotional time, anyway. He had become Big Ten  commissioner on Sept. 1, 1971, after 8 years as commissioner of the Big Eight  and 11 years of service in the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. office. They  had just sold their home of 19 years to make the move to Chicago.  </P> <P> After all those years of going to Miami every holiday season for the Orange  Bowl, they were in Southern California -- where it was raining.  </P> <P> The Michigan team was having to practice in Bakersfield.  </P> <P> Nothing was looking too rosy.  </P> <P> And then, the all-important game. In the final minutes of the game, Michigan  got a safety to go ahead of Stanford, 12-10. But Don Bunce, the Stanford  quarterback, took Stanford down the field and Rod Garcia kicked a field goal to  beat the Wolverines.  </P> <P> "Martha and I had been talking about how the final standings would go if  Michigan lost, and we knew that Big Eight teams were going to be 1-2-3," Duke  said. "We'd been talking about that for days.  </P> <P> "Well, Lawrence Welk was grand marshal of the parade that year, and he was at  the Tournament House that night for the party. He stood up there and said, 'A-1  and a-2 and a-3,' and Martha burst into tears."  </P> <P> Not a happy memory.  </P> <P> The Dukes decided in subsequent years to skip the party at the Tournament  House. It was a celebration. Often the Big Ten contingent didn't feel like  celebrating. The Dukes would go back to the presidential suite at the Pasadena  Hilton to spend the evening with Big Ten guests.  </P> <P> Last season, when Michigan State beat USC, they again skipped the Tournament  House celebration. It wouldn't look right to show up only after a victory.  </P> <P> So the Dukes were back in their suite that evening, savoring a victory that,  admittedly, was a "blue collar win . . . a game we won after USC fumbled, but  we'd lost a lot of games that way" when there was a knock at the door.  </P> <P> "All the Rose Bowl officers -- Harriman Cronk and all the rest -- came to bring  me my Rose Bowl watch," Duke said. "That was a highlight. They left their  celebration to bring that to me, and I appreciated that."  </P> <P> There were some points in their long relationship when some of the Rose Bowl  folks were not too happy with Duke, when he sided with the movement to exclude  the exclusivity clause from the Rose Bowl contract.  </P> <P> Some feared that allowing Big Ten and Pac-10 teams to compete in other bowls,  also, would dilute the impact of the Rose Bowl. Duke believed that the Rose  Bowl, matching the champions of the conferences, would remain as strong as ever  while letting more teams compete would be of benefit to both conferences.  </P> <P> He was right, as usual.  </P> <P> Over the last few years, Big Ten and Pac-10 schools have claimed an average of  40% of the total bowl pot of about $50 million.  </P> <P> Duke points out that opening opportunities was good for parity in his  conference, good for attendance, good for recruiting.  </P> <P> "When I had just been named commissioner of the Big Eight, and I was only 34  years old at the time, one of the first things I faced was the news that the  Orange Bowl was terminating our exclusive contract," Duke said. "They wanted to  be able to invite the top teams, to have a 'national championship' game.  </P> <P> "Sports Illustrated wrote that the loss of that contract would be the death  knoll of the Big Eight. Actually, it turned out to be a boon to the Big Eight.  It opened up vistas for other bowls. We went to the Cotton Bowl, the Sugar Bowl  and the Orange Bowl. It was great for our conference."  </P> <P> Since the Rose Bowl changed its policy, and the Big Ten started to compete in  other bowls in 1976, Big Ten schools have taken 56 bowl berths.  </P> <P> Duke and his wife have been at a bowl game on New Year's Day for the last 26  years. They might attend a bowl game just for fun next year. Or they might not.  </P> <P> If he's not at the Rose Bowl next year, he says he'll miss it.  </P> <P> "I've been to most of the bowl games at one time or another," Duke said. "I've  been to all the major bowls -- Orange, Cotton, Sugar. . . . And this is not to  degrade any of the others. But I think the Rose Bowl is special."  </P></p>

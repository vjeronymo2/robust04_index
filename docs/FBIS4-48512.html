			<p>BFN     [Text] Deputy President F.W. de Klerk has played down  concern that the ANC's reconstruction and development plan will  cost twice as much as originally estimated. Addressing a news  conference in London he said that the government would provide a  better quality of life for everyone, but only by spending what  it could afford. This might mean that the government would not  reach the ANC's declared goal of one million new homes in five  years. He said South Africa was not looking for handouts but  for free trade and investment. Mr. De Klerk is in London to  deliver the SUNDAY TIMES Nobel Laureate peace lecture.</p>

			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report London robusta COFFEE and COCOA limped to a close little changed from opening levels and lamenting the delayed opening of their New York counterparts following the bomb at the World Trade Centre. 'It's been a waste of time this afternoon. Everyone's been sitting around, twiddling their thumbs,' one London cocoa dealer said. The weakness of the French franc against sterling was keeping origins sidelined and adding some light support. Otherwise, dealers were keeping one eye on pact talks in Geneva, where consumers and producers failed to agree last week on a compromise proposal. After separate group meetings, delegates said there were signs the gap between the two sides was beginning to narrow, but many traders were still cynical. Coffee traders were expecting little market-moving news from a two-day producer meeting in Mexico City in preparation for the next set of pact talks later this month. In New York arabica prices were sharply down after a delayed opening. Compiled from Reuters</p>

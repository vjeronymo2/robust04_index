			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / Business and the Environment: Japan's electric rubbish The hum of electric rubbish trucks is becoming a familiar sound to the residents of Yokohama, south of Tokyo. There are only four of them at the moment, but the city council's environment bureau hopes to raise the number to 30 before long. What is unusual about the trucks is that their batteries are charged up using power generated by the incineration plant to which they deliver their rubbish. The plant, one of five large incinerators which consume Yokohama's vast rubbish output, uses its heat to drive a 12MW steam turbine. (Some electricity also goes to run a nearby old people's home and the remainder is sold to the local electric utility.) The trucks themselves have the capacity to carry 1.75 tonnes of rubbish. But the drawback is the batteries. Each truck has 26 of them weighing the better part of a tonne, and until the weight can be brought down there is a limit to the trucks' possibilities, according to Hiromasa Hayashi, who is in charge of development. The Hokubu incinerator plant was designed to be as self-contained and environment-friendly as possible. The main plant is almost completely air-tight. The only large entrance - the one through which the rubbish trucks come and go - is also the air intake for the furnaces. A constant inrush of air prevents unpleasant smells from escaping. The main chamber is a vast space-age hall with grabber cranes which load rubbish into the three furnaces. The ash produced at the other end is used for land reclamation in the harbour. The stack is subject to strict emission controls. Hokubu processes 1m tonnes of rubbish a year and employs 98 workers. The plant is only eight years old, but Suzumu Ichinokawa, the plant manager, doubts that the council would be able to site any more plants close to the city, despite all the efforts to make them acceptable. 'It's very hard to get such plants built now because local people don't like them,' he explains</p>

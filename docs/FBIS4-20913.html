			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev -- On 7 April, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister  Valeriy Shmarov met representatives of the U.S. Department of  Energy and the U.S. commission for nuclear regulation. He  expressed concern in connection with the fact that the Russian  Minatom [Ministry of Nuclear Power Engineering] had no money for  the production of fuel cassettes for nuclear power stations,  which Russia pledged to supply to Ukraine in exchange for  nuclear warheads, in compliance with the trilateral agreement  between the United States, Ukraine, and Russia on the nuclear  disarmament of Ukraine. In this situation, pointed out the  deputy prime minister, those $60 million that the United States  was going to pass over to Russia would be of help, however, this  has not been done as yet. U.S. Ambassador William Miller, who  was present at the meeting, responded by saying that the money  had already been transferred to the relevant bank account.</p>

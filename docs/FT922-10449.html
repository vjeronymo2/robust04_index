			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Survey of Building For Asia's Future (13): Grappling with solutions - Thailand: Bangkok transport THERE are two ways of developing a country's infrastructure, a wise diplomat with commercial experience in Africa and Asia said recently. In Africa, governments tend to build infrastructure, get into debt and wait vainly for economic growth and foreign investors. In Asia, they tend to encourage business, get rich, and try to cope with the resulting chaos by expensively inserting the infrastructure into the existing economy. Both methods were flawed, the diplomat believed, but the Asian approach was better because at least it encouraged the sort of economic growth regarded as essential in the modern world. Thailand, and in particular Bangkok, the capital, is probably the best-known example of the 'let's-build-the-infrastructure-later' approach. After two decades of rapid growth and industrialisation centred on Bangkok, it became clear by the late 1980s that the city's nightmarish traffic jams and environmental problems were starting to throttle the economy, alienate tourists and make the prospect of life in well-ordered Singapore ever more inviting for companies and individuals. Two solutions have been adopted. The first is to try to industrialise in the regions - especially the eastern seaboard and the southern seaboard - and the second is to improve the transport network in Bangkok, a city of some 9m inhabitants plagued by lack of planning, an exceptionally poor road network and the absence of any underground railway or mass transit system. Each day in the capital, there are 218 train movements which periodically stop the already slow-moving traffic at level crossings. A visitor to Bangkok can see the engineering and management skills involved in building prefabricated flyovers and elevated expressways with minimum disruption to the existing traffic. But the large mass transit projects - delayed for years by indecision and the manoeuverings of successive governments - have yet to begin. According to the Seventh Plan Urban and Regional Transport report, inelegantly named Spurt, about Bt200bn is forecast to be spent on transport investment in the Bangkok area between 1992 and 1996 (about half of it by private concessionaires), compared with a total of Bt30bn (mostly by the public sector) in the previous five-year plan. Much of the money is destined for three large projects: the Bt80bn combined property development, road and rail scheme hurriedly proposed by Hopewell of Hong Kong when the State Railway of Thailand wanted to elevate its tracks; the Bt65bn Skytrain, an idea dating back 17 years and now to be developed by a consortium led by SNC-Lavalin of Canada, with the help of CDollars 800m in Canadian government money; and the Bt18bn elevated railway ordered by the Bangkok Metropolitan Authority (BMA) from local property developer Tanayong. All the projects have been approved, but there is a snag: they conflict with each other and with other expressway plans in 33 places and duplicate each other on certain routes. Such conflicts arose because the three projects come under the auspices of different authorities - the Ministry of Transport and Communications for Hopewell, the Expressway and Rapid Transit Authority for the Skytrain, and the BMA for the Tanayong project. The result is that the concessionaires will find it more difficult to raise finance for routes duplicated by competing projects, and contracts may have to be rewritten to take into account changes made to avoid the conflicts. A report, published last year by consultants Wilbur Smith for the government, analysed the various conflicts between four expressways and the three mass transit systems and concluded soberly: 'Worthy as each project may be by itself, co-ordination between these (government) agencies and the concessionaires involved has been lacking as to land and air rights usage, and they do not provide for the interchange of vehicles or passengers to the extent needed to constitute a co-ordinated, coherent transport system.' The problem was, the report said, that each of the 33 conflict points could be resolved individually, but not if it was considered in conjunction with the adjacent conflict points. Long-suffering Bangkok residents could only smile as they imagined the bizarre seven-level structure which would have to be built to accommodate the worst cross-over point involving the various schemes. The Smith report, citing the risk of severe environmental damage and high costs, made recommendations which are generally regarded as sensible both by the authorities and by the concessionaires. Thailand had the technical talent to overcome its transport difficulties, it said, and needed to do so because the cost of delay was far greater than the combined cost of all the projects. But the country had to have 'a clear statement of goals'. Above all, the report recommends the formation of a clearing house, known as the Office of the Megaprojects (Omega), to resolve conflicts and co-ordinate everything from engineering and architecture to finance and real estate management. Mr Sansern Wongcha-um, director of the infrastructure projects division at the National Economic and Social Development Board, is philosophical: 'In Bangkok we never had a plan. Everything grew up individually.' For Mr Sansern the main obstacle to progress has been the tendency of successive governments to grant concessions to the private sector without preparing strict guidelines, but he believes the difficulties will be overcome. 'I'm sure that we can solve it,' he said. 'Engineering I think we can solve. We don't have a problem of investment. The only problem that we have to solve is management.' Although the concessionaires regard the raising of finance as tricky, they agree that demand for transport is so high in Bangkok - and the potential profits from property development along the various routes so tempting - that viability is not seriously in doubt as long as the conflicts between the various leading contracts are resolved. 'Some serious decisions have to be taken eventually,' said one senior project manager. 'The question is when is that to be done? It's really a question of who builds first.' With Thai politics in its usual turmoil following the general election in March, and corruption never far from the surface, the prospect of contractors rushing to build multi-million dollar mass transit systems and present their competitors with a fait accompli is likely to attract only the hardiest investors. And even if the three mass transit projects go ahead with all the conflicts resolved under strict government supervision, Mr Sansern will not be satisfied. 'As for mass transit we need more than this,' he said, pointing out that Bangkok was expanding to the east and north-east and that the new airport would be finished in eight years, requiring further transport decisions within about two years. 'We need another long-term plan,' he said, 'and we should start now.'</p>

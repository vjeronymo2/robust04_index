			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Wm Low warns on full-year profits WM LOW, the Scottish super-market group, alarmed the City yesterday by warning that full-year profits would fall below last year's Pounds 23.6m. The announcement sparked a 38p fall to 224p in the company's share price. Dundee-based Low blamed the recession for a fall in sales volumes and operating margins and the financial strains imposed by its ambitious store opening programme. The group, which trades from 66 supermarkets, said sales volumes from comparable trading space were some 4 per cent to 5 per cent lower than in a good year but that this decline had had a disproportionate impact on margins. Mr Jim Millar, chairman and chief executive, said: 'Across the board we are still seeing double-digit sales increases on last year including our new stores. But we tightened gross margins quite deliberately with our price freeze last year and have now seen a further tightening because of the sales situation and the rising costs in some of our older stores.' Low said it was confident that the benefits of the store opening programme would eventually flow through as planned. The company opened six stores in the first half of the year which incurred heavy promotional costs, but they are expected to contribute strongly to profits in the second half. Low is not the only food retailer to feel the effects of the recession. Gateway and Tesco have recently announced plans to reduce their cost bases by trimming staff numbers. Mr Millar said it might be necessary to 'tweak' labour costs in some of its stores to align them more closely with sales levels. 'But we have no programme of saying 'let's go out and take Pounds 1m out of our personnel bill',' he said. He added that there was no connection between the profits warning and the abrupt announcement last week of the departure of Mr Colin Mitchell as managing director after the company had been 'unable to resolve the future role he would play in the organisation'. Mr Mitchell had been seen by many as Mr Millar's heir apparent. 'I am 61 and the board is well aware that the succession is something that has to be addressed,' Mr Millar said yesterday.

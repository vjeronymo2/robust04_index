			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Observer: Liberal talents His party could never bring itself to sup with Neil Kinnock's socialists, but Des Wilson, the Liberal Democrats' former campaign manager, prides himself on his professional ability to turn tricks in all directions. Now he's signed a contract to run a public relations campaign for an organisation which thought Kinnock too soft  - the Trades Union Congress. For a fee around Pounds 50,000  - modest enough in British PR terms  - Wilson will build a zimmer frame to help the TUC clamber forth from the 19th century. Burson-Marsteller will be pleased; not for the cash but more for the free PR it gets from handling a well-known, if somewhat humbled, client. Meanwhile, Wilson is certainly having more success as a buccaneering spin-doctor than one glued to a party line.</p>

			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Magnet beats forecasts and Berisford cuts loss Berisford International, the former commodities and property group which bought the Magnet kitchen and joinery business in March, yesterday announced its first dividend for five years. Operating profits from the first seven months at Magnet were Pounds 6.2m - well ahead of City expectations. However, the group remained in the red for the year to the end of September, with a pre-tax loss of Pounds 3.2m on total turnover of Pounds 157.5m, compared with a loss of Pounds 5.5m on turnover of Pounds 77.6m previously. The board is proposing a dividend of 0.5p a share. Mr Alan Bowkett, chief executive, said the shareholders deserved 'something for supporting us over the last few years'. Mr Bowkett said the group was now profitable in its continuing business. Furthermore, it was making good progress in its search for another acquisition, this time in the US, where it has more than Dollars 600m (Pounds 365m) of tax losses. The group ended the year with Pounds 53.6m of net cash, up from Pounds 3.5m. Since then it has sold Ketlon, the automotive components concern, realising Pounds 21m and taking the net cash position to Pounds 70m. Mr Bowkett said that he hoped to have completed a deal in the US by the middle of next year. Magnet's operating profits were struck on sales of Pounds 102m and followed a previous loss of Pounds 900,000. Since March the group has cut staff by 469 and closed 31 high street outlets. So far it has spent Pounds 4.9m on restructuring. It has begun to address new markets, particularly national builders of new houses. But it has also made big efforts to get back the jobbing builder, a likely repeat purchaser, by using its mailing list of 40,000 tradesmen. Total group operating profits were Pounds 3.3m. The loss from discontinued operations, including the cocoa trading associate, totalled Pounds 8.4m. Losses per share came out at 2.1p, compared with 4.5p. COMMENT Stripping out the Pounds 4m of gains from property and other disposals and the Pounds 8.9m of provisions would leave Berisford with a 'normalised' pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.7m - or better than the break-even figure expected by the City. This reflects the impressive result at Magnet, where margins have been quickly lifted to 6 per cent, or about half the level of competitors. The shares are being held for Magnet's potential, the hitherto successful management team, and the potential for a US acquisition. The group has a head start in the US with the tax losses and Pounds 70m in the bank. Whether investors should buy more shares depends less on the forecast profits, estimated at Pounds 18m this year, than on how strongly they feel that success can be repeated across the Atlantic.</p>

			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / International Capital Markets: CBOT may lose main stock index contract THE Chicago Board of Trade may lose the right to trade its biggest stock index futures contract, the Major Market Index. The CBOT's cross-town rival, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, is negotiating to add the product to its own cache of stock index futures products. The New York Futures Exchange is also lobbying to obtain rights to trade MMI futures. The CBOT trades MMI futures under licence from the American Stock Exchange, which invented the 20-stock high capitalisation index in 1983. The Amex trades options on the instrument, which is designed to track the movements of the closely-watched Dow Jones Industrial Average. The CBOT's agreement with the Amex expires in October. It is understood that the Amex is considering a more profitable venue for the futures contract, and this could possibly end 10 years of co-operation with the CBOT. Although the CBOT's MMI futures traded in excess of 10,000 contracts per day before the 1987 stock market crash, daily volume has since fallen to about 800 contracts. Fewer than 25 CBOT members are committed to trading the index futures. The CME is thought to be a strong contender for the MMI, because it has several hundred traders dealing in its successful S&amp;P 500 stock index futures pit. CME traders say the MMI would provide spreading opportunities with the broad-based S&amp;P 500 futures. Ms Kathy Fitzpatrick, Amex spokeswoman, confirmed the Amex was talking with the CME about the MMI futures licence, but said no decision has been made. Mr Fred Grede, the CBOT's vice-president for administration, said the exchange was in negotiations with the Amex to retain the MMI contract. He expected a decision during July.</p>

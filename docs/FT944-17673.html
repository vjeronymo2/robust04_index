			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Bosnian POW exchange Bosnian Serb and Moslem troops completed an exchange of prisoners of war in Sarajevo yesterday after nearly a year of negotiations, writes James Whittington. The prisoner swap - involving 129 Serbs and 166 Moslems - took place at the Brotherhood Unit Bridge in the beseiged capital early in the morning. Mr Yasushi Akashi, UN envoy, said he hoped the swap would help ease other problems between the warring sides.

			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Bowater Bowater's premium rating, which has been carefully cultivated over the years, was blown away in one puff yesterday as its shares fell 8 per cent. That may partly reflect a cyclical reversal of fortune with Bowater's previous virtues being transformed into present vices: defensiveness in recession now appears dullness in recovery. Good treasury management, which produced interest income despite year-end debt of Pounds 262m, now smacks more of financial alchemy. Bowater's penchant for buying exhausted leveraged buy-out companies once seemed a clever way of buying assets on the cheap. But the drawbacks are now becoming apparent, with Bowater having to spend much time and capital injecting vim and vigour. The most serious worry, though, is what differential rates of inflation will do to margins. Bowater's suppliers - most conspicuously the pulp and paper manufacturers - are currently pushing through big price rises. But it may prove difficult for Bowater to pass the parcel on to its customers, producing a nasty margin squeeze. Besides, Bowater's customers are growing ever more demanding, specifying shorter runs and higher standards. That puts another pressure on margins, which will not quickly be reversed. With no currency gains likely this year, Bowater's attractions as a recovery stock have soured. But with volumes growing at a respectable 3 per cent, Bowater still retains its longer-term appeal. After a frantic spell of corporate activity, Bowater must now consolidate. The shares seem likely to do the same.</p>

			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Survey of Egypt (9): Strict controls applied - The cotton industry is being rescued from terminal decline The winds of change are picking up speed over Egypt's cotton fields, breezing through its spinning mills, and buffeting the country's textiles industry. Egypt's production of cotton is all classed as Extra Fine Cotton. About one-quarter is Extra Long Staple (ELS), which means that fibre lengths are 1 3/8' and above, such as the varieties Giza 77, Giza 70 and Giza 45. ELS is popular because of its long fibrelength - which can produce high counts in weaving - together with its strength and durability. After more than 30 years of strict state control the Egyptian government has finally accepted that capitalist forces are required to rescue the cotton sector from terminal decline. The resulting process of deregulation and eventual privatisation is causing the biggest shake-up since the sector was nationalised in the early 1960s. The government's long term strategy in liberalising the cotton sector is to try to regain Egypt's prominent position as a world exporter. Well before Liverpool or New York became world centres for the cotton trade, the Egyptian city port of Alexandria on the Mediterranean had an active futures market - as early as 1861. As the number one producer of premium long and extra long cotton staples, famed for comfort and durability, the sector flourished until the mid-1970s. Before then the cotton crop was a lucrative 10m qantars, 77 per cent of which were exported. Local farmers planted cotton in more than twice the area planted today (currently 840,296 feddans), and all the best designer labels of the time were marked; 'Made With The Finest Egyptian Cotton'. But government mismanagement has caused Egypt's cotton output, particularly exports, to fall dramatically. The six state-run co-operative marketing companies, which control the buying and selling of cotton, have been offering increasingly low procurement prices for the crop to cover the mounting costs of its monopoly. This lack of a financial incentive caused farmers to switch to more competitive produce which they could sell on the open market - even at the expense of being fined for ignoring government instructions to allocate a certain acreage of their land to cotton. Thus cultivation techniques became sloppy and yields fell. At the same time, mounting inefficiencies ate into the 12 public sector spinning and weaving mills. They did not have to compete for their work; they became beset by problems of excess labour and outdated technology. Deterioration of quality went side by side with mounting debts. As more and more subsidies were pumped into flagging operations, the government-fixed cotton prices rose above the international market. Foreign demand diminished. Among cotton traders Egypt became known as expensive and unreliable. On top of all this, the collapse of important markets in the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe, which received 40 per cent of exports, and an overall glut in world cotton supplies, exacerbated the decline. As a result, cotton exports plummeted from 7.5m qantars in the 1960-1961 season to 3.29m qantars in 1980-1981 - and just 360,000 qantars in 1990-1991. Gross lint revenues were worth only Dollars 52m in 1991-1992 and Dollars 43m last year, leaving cotton as the country's sixth main source of foreign exchange after rice. Faced with the eventual bureaucratic strangulation of cotton farming in Egypt, the government decided once again to open up to the private sector. A new law, which is expected to be on the statute books in September 1994, in time for the coming season, will formalise this transition. Plans are under way to re-open the spot price Mina Al Basal Cotton Exchange in Alexandria and the sector will be open to private competition. 'The new law will finally give choice to those working in cotton,' explains Mr Ahmad Shouman, chairman of the state-owned Cotton and International Trade Company, who has helped to draft the law. 'Suddenly farmers will be able to choose at what price they sell. Traders will choose which spinning and weaving mills to use. Clothes manufacturers will choose which yarn or fibre they want. They will all be free to do what they like,' he says from his office in Alexandria. In an attempt to cushion the shock of price changes when the exchange opens, the government has raised the price at which cotton is bought from farmers, and lowered its export rates closer to the international market. This, along with a concerted effort by the state to improve yields through a more refined use of pesticides, resulted in a 22 per cent rise in output last season over 1991-1992, from 5.8m qantars to 7.1m qantars, and a slight rise in export volumes. On the input side, subsidies on cotton seed, fertilisers, pesticides, and irrigation costs are due to be completely scrapped this season, and their supply also opened to the private sector. This will wipe away sizeable government outlays. A report prepared by the American embassy in Cairo calculates that despite a 50 per cent reduction in fertiliser subsidies, it still cost the government EPounds 25m in 1992-1993, while pest control cost EPounds 112m. Some farmers in the Delta region fear that the cut in subsidies, together with the expected drop in cotton prices when the exchange opens, will make cotton less profitable. Mr Madi Fayez Taboul, who rents 25 acres of land from the government near Alexandria, says that he has not planted cotton this year because he has no idea what its price will be. 'When I sell to the government I know what I'll get - but now I don't know what's happening,' he complains. Textiles manufacturers and cotton traders, however, are more sanguine about the changes. 'Only those making money without work have been cornered,' says Mr Fathi Ahmad Ali, chairman of Egypt's second largest spinning and weaving factory (which is 100 per cent state owned), looking forward to more competitive prices. Most observers agree that those with the most to gain from the liberalisation programme will be the exporters. Mr Said Haggag, managing director of Alcotan, the public trading company, says that cotton exporters will be able to focus on recapturing the world market in the premium ELS cotton varieties which have been losing ground over the past decade to American grown Pima cotton. For local consumption, spinners and clothes manufacturers do not require the high quality of ELS and are increasingly turning to imported medium and coarse cotton varieties. About 1m qantars of medium and short staple American cotton are normally imported in a year, making up nearly one fifth of local consumption. But with US cotton selling locally at Dollars 0.74/lb compared with over Dollars 1.5/lb for Egyptian varieties, this share is likely to widen as the textiles industry is given more freedom of choice. Mr Shouman believes that by the end of the century more than half of Egypt's cotton output will be exported in the form of either yarn, fabric or high quality clothing while the local market will mainly import foreign cottons. 'Whatever the balance, it will be for the market to decide,' he says.</p>

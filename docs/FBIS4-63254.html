			<p>BFN     [Text] Intensive consultations are under way in Kiev  following the Crimean parliament's decision to reinstate the  republic's constitution of May 6, 1992, presidential spokesman  Nikolay Mikhalchenko told Interfax-Ukraine.    "President Kravchuk and Speaker of Parliament Aleksandr  Moroz  are meeting to discuss the issue and I hope the president will  address the deputies today," he said.    On Wednesday, Kravchuk said that if Simferopol took a  decision to bring back its constitution, he would ask the  Ukrainian parliament to rescind it.    Mikhalchenko said that Simferopol's decision was out of line  with the Ukrainian basic law and therefore, illegal. "The  decision would lead to the setting up of a confederation in  Ukraine which is a unitary state," he said.</p>

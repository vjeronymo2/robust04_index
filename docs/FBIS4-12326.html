			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by News Research and Commentaries Group] </F>   [Text] The brave and martyr-seeking attack by a Palestinian  mujahid at a Zionist bus stop -- on the 40th day of the massacre  of fasting worshipers in the al-Khalil mosque -- which resulted  in the death of eight Zionists and the wounding of more than 50  others, shows, first and foremost, that the era of the intifadah  is different from the past. By undertaking responsibility for  this operation, the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement  Hamas stated that the car explosion at a Zionist bus stop in  'Afula in the north of occupied Palestine is in answer to the  massacre of the fasting Palestinian worshipers at the  al-Ibrahimi shrine and in order to avenge their unjustly shed  blood.    Political observers believe that this attack demonstrates  the  strength of the Palestinian Islamic movement in organizing and  carrying out jihad operations. Yesterday's attack took place on  the anniversary of the commencement of the intifadah and the  Zionist forces were on full alert. The place where the  operation took place was north of occupied Palestine, or, in  other words, outside the West Bank and Gaza Strip, a place where  carrying out operations is extremely difficult. The admission  by the Zionist chief of staff that the Zionist regime's military  forces will not be able to prevent such operations in the future  proves this point even further.    Since its founding, the Zionist regime has unilaterally  massacred and rendered homeless the people of Palestine and Arab  countries that share borders with occupied Palestine. Because  of the unequal military balance and extensive support by  international powers for the usurping regime, the reaction by  the people of Palestine and the world has not been strong enough  to stop this inhuman process. However, now that the Muslim  Palestinians have been armed with the spirit of jihad and  martyrdom, the situation has completely changed.    Seven years ago, with the commencement of the intifadah and  the persistent struggle against the Zionist regime, the  Palestinians gave up the past beliefs of political leaders of  Palestine in defending the rights of the Palestinian Muslims  through international organizations. By relying on the  Palestinian people and their Islamic belief, they set off on a  path that has proven to be effective and, God willing, will lead  to victory in the not very distant future.</p>

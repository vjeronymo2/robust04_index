			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Caparo deal may soon get court approval Caparo Group, the privately-owned UK steel and engineering business, expects to win court approval in the next two weeks for its acquisition of Pennsylvania-based Sharon Speciality Steel, writes Tim Burt. Mr Swraj Paul, the Anglo-Indian businessman who founded and chairs Caparo, said the group had given court officials details of its plans for the US group, which has been operating under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code for more than a year. 'We are planning to spend Dollars 25m (Pounds 16m) on expanding the plant and talks are already taking place with the unions about re-employing the workforce,' he said yesterday. The move follows lengthy negotiations with Sharon's creditors, who are understood to have welcomed the Caparo approach.</p>

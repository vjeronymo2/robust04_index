Mr. Yarov is also president of the Russian subcommitte in the  Russia-Vietnam intergovernmental committee on economic, trade,  scientific, and technological cooperation. Here is our radio  editor's opinion:    Throughout the meeting, the two sides informed each other of  the situation in each country, compared notes on bilateral  issues, and affirmed their wish to develop the traditional  friendly relations between Vietnam and Russia. Foreign Minister  Nguyen Manh Cam and Vice Premier Yarov reaffirmed that they will  quickly promote and broaden the cooperation for mutual interest  between Vietnam and Russia in the field of energy, planting, and  prospecting of tropical farm products, mining, and mine  industry. The two sides are determined to strengthen relations  between Vietnamese localities and those in the (?Far East) of  Russia and promote the trade relations between the business  enterprises between the two countries. On this occasion,  Vietnam and Russia observed positive developments in recent  relations between the two countries and maintained that these  relations will further develop in the future.    Their statements are correct. Over the last six months, the  two countries held repeated meetings at high level. Vietnamese  Vice Premier Tran Duc Luong last year paid a working visit to  Russia. Over the last five months, the Vietnamese foreign  minister paid two working visits to this country.    Despite many difficulties confronting Russia, Russian  leaders  spent much time to contact and discuss with the Vietnamese  leaders in order to strengthen the close relations between the  two countries. Particularly, Russia agreed to let Vietnam pay  its debt within its capacity. Russia also agreed with Vietnam's  proposal to have measures to ensure safety and security for  Vietnamese people working and studying in Russia.    The relations between Vietnam and Russia have undergone many  years of fine development. Now there is a ground to believe  that these relations will develop as those in the past on the  basis of equality and mutual benefit.</p>

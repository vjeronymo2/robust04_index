			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 5 KYODO -- Construction Minister Kozo  Igarashi said Tuesday [5 April] that his ministry will dispatch  a research team to the United States in April or May to study  using more imported construction materials to lower Japan's  housing costs.    Igarashi said the purpose of the mission is to study  construction costs. According to the ministry, housing  construction costs in Japan are 30 percent higher than in the  U.S. The ministry hopes to lower the cost by one-third by 2000.    Increased imports of housing materials from North America  have been cited as a way to lower prices.    Officials from the ministry and the Housing and Urban  Development Corp. will visit a factory that manufactures housing  material and interview U.S. Government and trading company  officials, the minister said. Igarashi said the schedule has  not been fixed, but indicated that the team will also visit  Canada, which also exports housing materials to Japan.</p>

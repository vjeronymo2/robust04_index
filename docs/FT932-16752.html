			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Cookery: An aromatic antidote arrives from Amalfi THE THOUGHT of the chocolate excesses that Easter usually brings makes me feel faintly queasy already. The lovely freshness of lemons provides a welcome antidote, and the lemons to be found in some parts of Britain this Easter are cause for special celebration. In Greece and Spain I have enjoyed lemons as they should be, picked fresh from the tree when needed, but the pleasure of these pales beside the magnificent offerings of Amalfi. The sfusato, or semi-sweet lemon of Amalfi, is unique to that area. It is big enough to suggest it has swallowed two ordinary lemons. Best of all, it is supremely aromatic. The juicy flesh is sharp and refreshing but not mouth-puckeringly acid. The pith is remarkably tender and lacks the bitterness that spoils so many lemons. And the zesty, oil-laden rind is scented so gloriously that 'ice and a slice' has taken on new meaning. Gone is the gin, gone is the tonic. Good plain water, ice cubes and a slice of Amalfi lemon is all I need. The Amalfi lemon is grown the traditional way without chemicals to force growth or sprays to prolong shelf life. You can use it in all the ways of an ordinary lemon - and many more. Because it is semi-sweet, you can reduce greatly the amount of sugar needed normally to make lemon puddings and drinks such as lemon barley water and lemonade. It makes exceptional lemon curd and the best candied peel I have tasted. For those on low-sodium and low-fat diets, it is invaluable as an alternative to salt and butter for seasoning vegetables. The perfumed juice is the making of elegant avgolemono soups and sauces, and the chopped flesh adds savour to meat and fish stews. In its homeland, the Amalfi lemon often is eaten on its own - cut into thin wedges, peel and all, to dip into sugar or salt. The thought might make you cringe, but try it. I like, too, the Amalfitana practice of serving salads of peeled and sliced lemons dressed with good olive oil and sea salt, scattered perhaps with black olives or celery leaves or rocket. Such salads make invigorating hors d'oeuvres and complement rich meats such as duck and oxtail. Because cultivating Amalfi lemons is difficult and expensive, they were in danger of dying out unless a new market could be found. They will be on sale  -on a trial basis - at selected branches of Safeway in the south-east. The average ordinary lemon, complete with nasty chemical cocktail, costs nearly 20p. Organic lemons, diminutive compared with the Amalfi variety and less aromatic by far, cost about 24p. So, the price tag of 59p for an Amalfi strikes me as very fair. ITALIAN LEMON CREAMS (serves 6) Portions here are small, as I find a few spoonfuls of dessert is as much as most people want at the end of a fine meal. One Amalfi lemon probably will yield all the juice you need, but it is wise to have a second on hand. Ingredients:  1/2 pt double cream; 1-1 1/2 Amalfi lemons; amaretti biscuits. Method: Grate the lemon zest into a small pan and stir in the cream. Place over low heat until the cream bubbles all round the edges. Cover the scalded cream and set it aside to infuse until barely tepid. Then stir in 6 tablespoons of lemon juice, one at a time. Crumble a pair of amaretti biscuits into each of six small glasses. Break up the biscuits with your fingers; do not reduce them to fine crumbs. Strain the cool lemon cream over the biscuits: some of the pieces will bob up as you do so. Cover and chill until ready to serve. The mixture firms as it cools, reaching syllabub consistency after 2-3 hours and setting softly if left for 8 hours or overnight. Eat using teaspoons, dipping the spoon to the depth of the glass so that each mouthful contains its fair share of soft, intensely lemony cream and of the sugary, bitter almond crunch of biscuit. Extra amaretti can be served on the side. Sweet-toothed friends will appreciate the offer of sugar.</p>

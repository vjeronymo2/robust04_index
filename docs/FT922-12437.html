			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Markets (At a glance): Quarterly Review of Personal Finance Will the present recession repeat some of the trends of the great Depression of the early 1930s? Could entry into the Exchange Rate Mechanism result in a long period of low inflation and low interest rates? And what will that mean for investors? The parallels are discussed in the FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance, published with next Friday's paper and repeated with Saturday's. The review also contains its normal wide-ranging coverage of the savings market, including a special survey on investment trusts.</p>

			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Leading Article: On earth, peace? English-speaking Christians have for centuries proclaimed 'on earth peace, good will toward men' at this season, following the Authorised Version of the Bible. The words attributed by St Luke to the heavenly host outside Bethlehem, however, are more exactly rendered as 'on earth peace among men of good will'. This is quite an important distinction. The passage in its original form gives no warrant for pure pacifism. It implicitly recognises that there are also men of ill will, who pose a threat to peace and should not expect to benefit from it. It is a perennial dilemma, and not only for Christians. The value of peace has always to be weighed against the danger of rewarding aggression, consecrating injustice, and thereby encouraging men of ill will to persist in the threat and use of force. The definition of 'men of good will' is inevitably subjective. In many cases peace can only be made by accepting professions of good will from those who hitherto have given and received ill will in abundant measure; and by allowing them to keep what seem thoroughly ill-gotten gains. Topical examples abound. Black South Africans have had to accept leaders of the National party, which devised and implemented apartheid, as men of good will; and to accept, as part of the price of peace, the perpetuation of gross disparities in average wealth between white and black. Palestinians are being told, without any assurance that they will get a state of their own, that the path to peace lies through acceptance of the permanent loss of many of their homes, and the greater part of their country. Israelis are asked to accept that peace involves giving power to a man whose whole career was built on violence against them and denial of their state's right to exist; while law-abiding people in Northern Ireland are told that peace requires concessions to people who have sought them through terror and violence in preference to the ballot box. Public opinion In these cases, world public opinion applauds those who put peace before justice, and condemns those who believe the price they are asked to pay for peace is too high. Yet few argue that Britain would have been right to make peace with Hitler in 1940; and most people still recoil at the suggestion that Bosnia should accept a peace based on the simple ratification of Serb conquests. In all such discussions, the claims of equity have to be weighed against those of realism. No one nowadays argues (as in the past many did) that war is good and healthy in itself. All agree that it is at best a necessary evil, and therefore those who argue for it in some circumstances have to demonstrate that the net result of pursuing it will be less bad than the alternative. The Catholic doctrine of the just war, which requires among other things a reasonable prospect of victory, is not as Machiavellian as it sounds; or rather, it shows that Machiavelli is not as unethical as he is often painted. Ethics does not forbid political leaders to weigh carefully the practical consequences of their decisions. On the contrary, it requires them to do so, most of all when faced with a choice between war and peace. Complex conflicts In the early 1990s, the end of the cold war and the reversal of Iraq's aggression against Kuwait gave rise to hopes that justice could henceforth be effectively upheld by international action, and that realism would no longer dictate the acceptance of flagrant injustice as the price of peace. But since then, attention has focused on more complex conflicts, where citizens of the same state are ranged on opposite sides, so that consensus is not easily reached among outsiders about the precise balance of right and wrong, or about the degree of external aggression, if any. International intervention in these conflicts has been confused, half-hearted and agonisingly slow, especially in contrast to the decisive and spectacular action against Iraq. In Somalia and Bosnia, 'humanitarian' intervention may only have served to prolong conflict. In Rwanda, intervention came too late to prevent the massacre of up to a million people. The result is disillusionment and a return to passivity. Not only is Russian brutality in the Caucasus considered beyond the reach of western influence. In Algeria, on the doorstep of western Europe, a civil war is now claiming 700 lives a week, yet is virtually ignored by the outside world. The UN Security Council has not even discussed the matter. Peace has become divisible. After briefly glimpsing a new world order, the victors of the cold war have resigned themselves to tolerating anarchy in large areas of the globe, so long as their own material interests are not directly threatened. No doubt a dose of realism and modesty was required, after the euphoria of early 1991. But between euphoria and abdication there is, or should be, a sense of the responsibility that goes with wealth and power, and of the longer-term risks involved in letting men of ill will have their way.</p>

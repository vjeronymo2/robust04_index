			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Cleaner killed by IRA bomb A police station cleaner was killed and his wife and two young children injured yesterday when their car was blown up by an IRA bomb. John Anthony, 38, died and his three-year-old daughter was hurled from the car in Lurgan, County Armagh. Mr Anthony's nine-year-old son, suffering from cuts and bruises, ran for help to his grandparents' house nearby. Mr David Trimble, the Ulster Unionist MP for Upper Bann, said the killing showed the government there was no point talking to republicans.</p>

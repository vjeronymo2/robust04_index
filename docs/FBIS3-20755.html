			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Marcin Dominik Zdort: "Peasants to the Right"] </F>   [Text] It appears that, before long, the only peasant  party remaining will be the PSL (Polish Peasant Party). Other  groups, until recently willing to appeal to the peasant  tradition, today renounce the "class character" and prefer to  call themselves nationwide parties. In seeking their place  rather in the center or on the right of the political spectrum,  they place themselves within broader alliances as their "peasant  legs."  <H5>  Kaczynski's Peasant Activists </H5>   PSL-Peasant Accord (PSL-PL), the group led by Gabriel  Janowski, entered the center right bloc called forth by Center  Accord (PC) and the Christian-National Union (ZChN). The  right-wing tendencies of the PSL-PL do not, however, apply to  its economic program. Janowski's group is against the "overly  strong" competition in Polish agriculture. The president of this  party maintains that "our farmer is sufficiently innovative, and  it is not necessary to flog him with the whip of competition."  Also for this reason, Gabriel Janowski, former minister of  agriculture (in the Olszewski and Suchocka governments), strived  to introduce measures to protect the peasants against foreign  competition, favoring the introduction of compensatory payments,  fighting for minimum prices and for establishing the Fund for  Farm Restructuring and Debt Reduction (FRiOR). The PSL-PL  leader, on the other hand, is against "the ideological  privatization of the PGR's (the state farms)." He thinks that  the land should not end up in the hands of people with no  connection to agriculture.    The right-wing tendencies of the PL manifests itself in the  ideological sphere. The PL is closely tied to the Catholic  Church and was even viewed as the "peasant leg of the ZChN,"  although, despite attempts by both parties, it did not result in  the formation of an electoral coalition of these parties before  19 September [the date of the parliamentary elections of 1993].  Janowski's party, underscoring its ties to Catholicism,  supported the introduction into legal acts of the obligation to  comply with Christian values and today resists the proposed  compromises to the abortion law. The right-wingedness of the  PSL-PL also is based on its relationship to communism--the party  leaders are advocates of decommunization, and the party deputies  voted in favor of the lustration resolution. Those among the  PL's politicians who found themselves on Macierewicz's list  [Antoni Macierewicz, minister of internal affairs in the  Olszewski government, who produced a list of people he claimed  had cooperated with the secret police in the communist  government], even if, like Antoni Furtak, they won their suit  against the Ministry of Internal Affairs, were not among the  candidates for Sejm deputy in the September elections.    The position of the PSL-PL in the alliance called forth by  the PC and the ZChN is rather weak. It became further weakened  when the "tripartite accord" was transformed into a "quaternary  accord" (Romuald Szeremietiew of the RDR [Movement for the  Republic] entered). Today the PL fulfills the rolls of the  "peasant leg" of the future federation of right-wing parties,  which want to be open also to rural centers. Even though its  leaders claim that the PL has about 20,000 members (hence a  rather large party), the election results of 2.37 percent do not  testify to its strength.    Waldemar Pawlak's Polish Peasant Party is not, according to  PSL-PL activists, an authentic peasant party but, rather, a  group that emerged from the rural nomenklatura. In  the best case, Pawlak's PSL is described as a leftist party, in  opposition to the rightist or centrist Solidarity-based peasant  parties. Former PSL-PL Senator Janusz Woznica thinks "the PSL is  a leftist party with a ZSL [United Peasant Party, the peasant  party allowed under communism, hence considered compromised]  lineage, the PL has a center lineage, and the SLCh  (Peasant-Christian Party) has a rather rightist countenance."  <H5>  Korwin's Peasant Activists </H5>   The other right-wing bloc--the "11 November Accord,"  established by UPR (Union for Real Politics), the PChD (Party of  Christian Democrats), and the PK (Conservative Party)--also has  its "peasant leg"--namely, the very same SLCh of Jozef Slisz and  Artur Balazs mentioned by Woznica [UPR is headed by Janusz  Korwin Mikke, hence the name in the subtitle]. In its program,  the SLCh clearly states, however, that it is not a peasant party  but a "nationwide" party. "The problems of the functioning of  the state are for us more important than the defense of the  interests of career farmers," states SLCh deputy chairman Artur  Balazs. He does not, however, hide the fact that his party  emerged from the countryside, that it was formed as an  alternative to the ZSL, and that it continues to maintain this  formula. Slisz's and Balazs's party from the very beginning saw  itself on the right side of the political scene and came out for  procapitalist changes and integration with the EC. The SLCh is  the only party with a rural lineage that cites Leszek  Balcerowicz [former minister of finance and deputy premier,  whose economic program set the reform in motion]. The party even  published a lecture by the former minister given at a seminar  dealing with the future of the Polish countryside.    The party's ties to the Catholic Ghurch are strong (as  underscored by the adjective "Christian" in its name), but  Balazs states that he understands Christianity to mean a  catalogue of moral principles.    "The PSL is a group with a leftist lineage, and it also  implements that kind of program," says Artur Balazs, when asked  to evaluate other peasant parties. "The PL is found on the right  side of the political scene, but its program clearly differs  from ours in that it is directed primarily toward the defense of  peasant interests."    The influences of the SLCh in the countryside are not the  greatest, even though the party admits to having about 20,000  members (like the PL). "We do not propose easy solutions, and we  do not promise universal, preferential, 10-percent credits. We  think that the process of economic transformation must equally  involve the countryside. This pertains to changes in agrarian  structures and technical infrastructures--we are in favor of a  modern countryside, simply stated, a European one," explains  Balazs, who maintains that time will verify the electoral  promises of the SLCh's opposition and that rural support for the  SLCh will increase in two or perhaps three years.</p>

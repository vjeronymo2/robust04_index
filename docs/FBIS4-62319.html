			<p>BFN     [Text] The communique on Bosnia signed on Friday by the  foreign ministers of Russia, the United States, Britain and  France and the European Union, "makes unhappy those who would  like to continue war there." The statement was made at the news  conference in Geneva by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev  following the talks there.    The summing-up document says that the settlement in Bosnia  is  possible only through talks. It fixes the idea for granting 51  pct of the territory to the Moslem-Croatian federation (49 pct  to the Serbs) and says about the possible stage-by-stage lifting  of sanctions against the Union Republic of Yugoslavia if the  settlement in materialised.    The Russian diplomats with whom an Interfax correspondent  talked to, stressed those provisions in the communique which, as  they believe, largely are based on the message by the Russian  leader Boris Yeltsin to the presidents of the United States and  France, Bill Clinton and Francois Mitterrand, to British Prime  Minister John Major and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.    Among them is the need to strictly observe all UN  resolutions, including the maintenance of the embargo for arms  deliveries to the Moslems; to deny claims by the Moslems and  Croats for possessing 58 pct of the Bosnian territory and the  idea that Bosnia-Herzegovina should consist of two equal parts.  There is still another point which, according to the Russian  diplomats, is a "clear hint" to the Moslems that the world  community will not tolerate hostilities around the town of Brcko.    According to a senior Russian diplomats, if Bosnian Serbs  agree to 49 pct of the territory and withdraw their troops, the  prospect for the lifting of sanctions from the Union Republic of  Yugoslavia will be realistic. Otherwise this will mean an  isolation, he said.    As Kozyrev noted at the news conference in Geneva, "our task  is not to ease life for one side, it is to advance every side to  reasonable solutions".</p>

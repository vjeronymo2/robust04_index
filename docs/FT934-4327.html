			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / State 'central to SA growth' A think-tank linked to the African National Congress yesterday published proposals to revive the South African economy which stress the central role of the state, rather than the private sector, in triggering growth from now until the end of the century. Introducing the proposals from the Macroeconomic Research Group, Mr Trevor Manuel, head of the ANC economics department, said they did not represent ANC policy. But ANC economists were involved in drawing them up, and they could have a significant influence over policy formulation. One ANC official said that some of the proposals were 'too conservative'. The research group, which includes members of the radical trade union movement, Cosatu, as well as members of the ANC and academics from local and foreign universities, drew up an economic model in which the state's role is central - in direct contradiction to the government's model, which focuses on private sector investment to revive growth. 'To achieve the goals of economic growth and redistribution, the state. . . must play a strong and active role in leading development,' the group said. Growth would rise from 1.1 per cent in 1994 to nearly 5 per cent annually within the first years of the next century, it said. This year's growth is expected to total 1 per cent. The model focuses on job creation, as well as improving access to and quality of health, housing, and electricity. It calls for a minimum wage to be set, but rules out any early recourse to a wealth tax. The think-tank said a post-apartheid government should resist raising personal and corporate tax rates, but the tax system should be restructured and should include a multiple-rate indirect value added tax favouring the poor.</p>

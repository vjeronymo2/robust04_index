			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Drop in French investment seen BUSINESS confidence in France has deteriorated since the start of the year, according to Insee, the state statistics institute. The new centre-right government had hoped recent interest rate cuts might encourage investment. But the Insee survey suggests industrialists will lower investment by a further 9 per cent this year, following last year's 10 per cent cut. Reductions are expected to be deepest in the motor industry, which yesterday reported a 14.2 per cent fall in output in the first quarter, and a 16.4 per cent drop in exports. The consumer goods sector is also expected to be badly hit. First-quarter growth figures, due soon, are expected to show a real decline in GDP - the second successive quarter of negative growth. The state-controlled Banque Nationale de Paris yesterday predicted negligible growth for the full year.</p>

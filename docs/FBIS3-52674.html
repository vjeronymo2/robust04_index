			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Dan Izenberg] </F>   [Text] The Knesset yesterday rejected a bill establishing  guidelines for the granting of compensation to Jewish settlers  leaving the administered territories.    Deputy Defense Minister Mordekhay Gur urged the Knesset to  vote against the bill, in a debate over policy and approach  which took place mainly within the ranks of the coalition.    It was the first discussion in the plenum by mainstream  coalition MKs [Knesset members] that touched on the final  settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute and the future of  the territories.    "The supporters of this government and those who believe in  it know we are not telling the nation the truth regarding  withdrawal," argued Avraham Poraz, who introduced the bill.  "They know we will not be able to preserve all the settlements  in the long run. They all know it, so let us not be afraid of  the Likud and the right. Our supporters know the truth, so we do  not have to hide it."    Gur urged the Knesset to vote against the bill, warning that  the controversy that it would trigger would endanger the peace  process.    "The government is opposed with all its might to this bill,"  he said. "If we have to choose between the difficulties in  drafting the bill in all its details and the political-human  difficulties we face at this juncture in our history, I am  convinced that we must give precedence to the proper and  efficient handling of the negotiations.    "Even if it is true that in the final analysis -- and I hope  we won't reach that point -- we will have to act under pressure  and pass a law, I still say to you that in choosing between the  alternatives, we must give precedence to the correct alternative  in terms of achieving the sacred goal of peace and security."    Poraz originally submitted his private member's bill in  March  1993, almost six months before the Israel-PLO Declaration of  Principles was signed. He wrote at the time that "when a peace  treaty is signed, there is a high probability that Israeli  citizens living or working in the territories will have to  leave, as happened in the evacuation of the Sinai."    Poraz urged drafting compensation legislation now to avoid  the "chaos" that ensued in the wake of the peace treaty with  Egypt. His bill was based on the 1982 Compensation of Sinai  Evacuees Law, while the evacuation of the settlers was already  in progress.</p>

			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Lloyd's uses TV to promote plan LLOYD'S OF LONDON yesterday unveiled details of an innovative publicity campaign to accompany the launch of its business plan next Thursday. The plan will outline ways in which Lloyd's expects to increase efficiency, boost profitability and attract fresh capital, following losses of more than Pounds 5bn over the last five years. The market is spending several thousand pounds to buy television time from a new commercial business channel, which is broadcast nationally in the early hours of the morning by BBC transmitters. Lloyd's is also holding press conferences to Toronto and New York by satellite as well as a press conference in London. The TV programme, which will feature presentations by Mr David Rowland, chairman, and Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive, is one of a handful to be broadcast by The Business Channel - a joint venture between BMH Communications and the BBC. Nuclear Electric, Cable &amp; Wireless and Scottish Power have made use of the channel since it was launched last May. Lloyd's has taken a 15-minute slot early on Friday morning. The service typically costs up to Pounds 60,000 per hour. Mr Peter Hill, head of communications, said: 'The broadcast gives us speed to communicate the implications of the business plan.' Lloyd's will spend a further Pounds 1,500 on British Telecom facilities for its satellite press conferences to north America: 1,600 of the market's 20,000 Names - the individuals supplying the market's capital - come from the United States and 300 from Canada.</p>

			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 911 SYSTEM CRASHES; COMPUTER IS BLAMED  </P> <P> The Los Angeles city emergency 911 telephone system crashed twice Saturday  afternoon -- once for 45 minutes -- according to officials, who blamed the  breakdown on a computer malfunction.  </P> <P> For four hours, the system was only partly functioning as Pacific Bell  engineers worked to repair computers at the Police Department's central  dispatch center in the basement of City Hall East, said Sgt. John Emerson of  the department's Communications Division. Officials reported that the problems  were fixed by 5:15 p.m.  </P> <P> Police said they were not aware of any emergency that went unanswered, but some  of the Police Department's stations reported an increase in calls as people  unable to get through to 911 operators called them directly.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Crashed a Second Time  </P> <P> Operators first discovered the phone lines out about 1 p.m., Emerson said.  Pacific Bell engineers restored parts of the system five minutes later, he  said, but at 3 p.m the system crashed again. A backup system also failed,  stopping all emergency calls for 45 minutes.  </P> <P> "Our computer has gone belly-up all over the place," Emerson said. "This has  never happened to us in the 911 system."  </P> <P> Pacific Bell officials said that four out of five callers who were unable to  get through to 911 operators were getting a recorded message. They said the  shutdown was caused by a power failure in the computer's signaling mechanism.  </P> <P> A similar but shorter blackout occurred Feb. 16, 1987; that one-hour outage was  also blamed on a power failure.  </P> <P> Engineers once again succeeded in restoring the system's phone lines at 3:45,  Emerson said. But the system's computers were still not working by late  afternoon and the 25 operators at the dispatch center were forced to process  calls manually, Emerson said.  </P> <P> Computers normally display the address and phone number of the person making  the emergency call. With the computers down, the operators had to transfer  calls by hand. "It's been so long since we've used this old (manual) system,"  Emerson said. "We've just stepped back 15 years."  </P> <P> Operators at the center receive about 200 calls per hour and relay them to  police and fire stations. Even after the phone lines were restored, operators  were having difficulty transfering the calls to Fire Department dispatchers,  Emerson said.  </P> <P> Emerson said that although people making calls to the emergency number might be  placed on hold for a few seconds longer, all calls were being answered by late  Saturday. "If people aren't calling in too much, we'll be OK," he said.  </P> <P> At some Police Department stations, officers noticed an increase in emergency  calls.  </P> <P> "To tell you the truth, no one officially told us why we were getting them,"  said Officer Tony Rivera of the Wilshire Station. "A few people told us that  they called 911 and were put on hold for . . . (an) unbelievable time."  </P> <P> Calls made to police at the Hollenbeck Station were relayed by radio to  dispatchers at City Hall, said Officer William Malin. "Everything was screwed  up, but it worked all right," he said.  </P> <P> Police in the field monitored the radio transmissions so that units that were  close to the site of the emergency could let dispatchers know that they were  available, Malin said.  </P> <P> Twice during the afternoon, Police and Fire Department officials released the  numbers of nine police and fire stations to call instead of 911 in emergencies.  </P> <P> Jim Wells, a spokesman for the Los Angeles City Fire Deparment, explained that  although by late afternoon calls were getting through to 911 dispatchers, the  alternative numbers were provided as a "precautionary measure" in case the  system broke down again.  </P> <P> Lt. Ron Young of the Northeast Station said it was fortunate that the breakdown  occurred Saturday afternoon, during a quiet part of the weekend.  </P> <P> "Things really haven't gotten rolling yet. This is the calm before the storm on  the weekends," he said.  </P> <P> The computerized 911 system was installed in Los Angeles in 1983. Located four  floors below ground level, it is designed to withstand a major earthquake.  </P> <P> "It's a very good system," said Pacific Bell spokeswoman Lisa Zanville.  </P> <P> The majority of calls received by the system operators are not emergencies and  are transferred to radio dispatchers who assign patrol cars according to  priority and availability. In life-threatening situations, however, operators  immediately dispatch the caller's location to patrol cars.  </P> <P> Staff writers Eric Malnic and Carol McGraw contributed to this article.  </P></p>

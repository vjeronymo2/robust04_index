The meeting will be held at the Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza, 4255 South Paradise Road, Las Vegas, NV 89109; tel (702) 369&hyph;4400, fax (702) 369&hyph;3770. The meeting, which is open to the public, will run from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. on Monday, June 13; then continue on Tuesday, June 14 at 8 a.m. The meeting on Tuesday should end around noon. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the meeting, panel members will hear presentations from the Department of Energy (DOE) and its contractors on improving the efficiency of underground exploration and construction of the exploratory studies facility (ESF). Efforts are under way to identify potential ways to reduce costs and shorten the excavation schedule by simplifying the design of the underground facility. Additional topics that will be addressed at the meeting include how the administration's new funding proposal for the high-level waste management program (Scenario A) will affect site-suitability issues; how to use the tunnel boring machine most efficiently during excavation of the five-mile, portal-to-portal main loop; how thermal loading issues could affect repository design; and how the proposed plan for 100-year retrievability, including in Scenario A, could affect the design of the repository. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board was created in the 1987 amendments act to evaluate the technical and scientific activities in the DOE's civilian radioactive waste management program, including site characterization, storage, and transport. A site at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, currently is being characterized by the DOE for its suitability as the possible location of a permanent repository for civilian spent fuel and defense high-level waste. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Transcripts of the meeting will be available on computer disk or on a library-loan basis in paper format from Victoria Reich, Board librarian, beginning July 26, 1994.

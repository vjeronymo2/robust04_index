			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Red tape task force to survey 500 small businesses THE government task force seeking to reduce red tape is to survey 500 small businesses on their views about European Community regulations, Charles Batchelor writes. The task force, which has responsibility for EC legislation, plans to recommend improvements in the way in which EC member states negotiate new laws as well as the way they are implemented and enforced in the UK. The survey will ask small businesses to identify regulations which are particularly burdensome. It will consist of a postal questionnaire followed by a telephone interview  -the aim is to make sure that the survey itself does not become an additional burden.</p>

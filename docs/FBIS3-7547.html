			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Due to engine trouble, a Cessna airplane  belonging to the aeroclub at the U.S. military's Kadena Air Base  [KAB] on Okinawa made an emergency landing in the car park at  Blue Beach, Kin village at about 1010 on 26 March. The male  pilot was not injured. According to U.S. Forces and Ishikawa  Police Station sources, no cars or people were in the car park  when the plane made its emergency landing, despite the fact it  was Saturday. The airplane was not damaged. And, despite the  fact any slight miscalculation in the maneuver could have caused  disaster, the public relations office of the 18th Flight Wing at  KAB did not file a report on the incident to the prefectural  government until 1700 on 27 March and then provided no details.  [passage omitted on details] The flight wing public relations  office report said "it was the only possible measure that could  have been taken," and "the pilot followed safety procedures."  [passage providing further details omitted]    The U.S. military contacted Ishikawa Police Station by phone  at about 1120. The pilot was alone at the site when police  officers arrived. Soon, however, other members of the aeroclub  and the U.S. military police arrived at the beach in a truck,  dismantled the wings of the plane, loaded everything onto the  truck, and took the plane back to KAB. Villagers at the beach  for recreation watched the dismantling in wonder.    According to the 18th Flight Wing, its security office is  currently carrying out an investigation into the cause of the  accident.    When the OKINAWA TIMES made a telephone inquiry into the  accident, the person at the aeroclub, to which the plane  belongs, refused to answer, saying they "do not have any  obligation to provide information." He repeatedly said: "You  should direct any inquiries to the public relations office (at  KAB)."    The aeroclub was discussed at last year's prefectural  assembly session for its alleged involvement in providing  fee-charging sightseeing flights to Japanese. The Ministry of  Foreign Affairs issued a strong protest to the U.S. Forces  saying such a practice was a violation of the Japan-U.S. Status  of Forces Agreement, and that "such incidents would certainly  lead to misunderstanding."

			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Algerian rebels murder Italians Suspected guerrillas have killed seven Italian sailors in their sleep during an overnight attack on their ship in Algeria, Reuter reports from Rome. It was the second biggest action against a single group of foreigners in Algeria since fighting erupted in 1992 between Islamic fundamentalists and security forces. The crew of the Naples-based Lucina had arrived to deliver grain at Jijel, east of Algiers. The deaths bring to 42 those of foreigners killed in the conflict.</p>

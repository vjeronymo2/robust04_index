			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Chip strategists seek way ahead TOP semiconductor technologists from industry, academia and US government laboratories are meeting in Dallas this week to develop a strategy for semiconductor research and development that can be used to direct future US industry and government spending. The group will prepare a report to be presented to President-elect Bill Clinton shortly before his inauguration. The meeting has been planned for over a year, but has taken on a new significance in light of Mr Clinton's plans to boost government spending on non-military research and development. 'The report is not expected to call for new money' or government-supported programmes for semiconductor research and development, said Mr Gordon Moore, chairman of Intel, who is chairing the meeting, 'but it should serve as a useful guide to ensure that both public and private funds are spent efficiently'. The technologists will identify critical areas of research that need to be addressed and determine where this work can best be done - whether at Sematech, the government-backed semiconductor industry research consortium, in national laboratories, university research departments or by individual companies or groups of companies. Elements of the strategy are expected to be drawn from the work of other industry-led groups including the Semiconductor Research Council, the National Advisory Committee on Semiconductors and Sematech. Rather than compiling a 'wish list' for semiconductor research, however, the technologists will attempt to formulate a plan for the industry to maintain its competitive posture without the influx of new funds, Mr Moore explained. The group hopes to guide the efforts of university and government researchers, Mr Moore said, preventing the possibility of research being diverted into 'weird materials and weird effects,' with little commercial potential. 'I don't know of any other industry in which the chief technologies from government laboratories, universities, consortia and private industries have come together to work out a technology direction. This could serve as a useful model for other industries,' Mr Moore said. The plan to present the industry-led report to Mr Clinton signals what is expected to be a much closer relationship between industry and the White House under the new administration.</p>

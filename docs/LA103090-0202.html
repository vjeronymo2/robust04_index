			<p><P> October 30, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: DEATH OF HER FATHER ADDS TO TROUBLES OF IVANA TRUMP  </P> <P> LAST WEEK, Ivana Trump struck me as lonely and upset, sitting in the baroque  gilt splendor of the Trump Tower penthouse. Now we add the loss of her father  to these feelings. Milos Zelnicek, 63, died of a heart attack Saturday and  Ivana, her aide Lisa, and the three children are all in Czechoslovakia.  </P> <P> It's no small thing for Ivana to lose her tall, handsome, supportive father. He  has been her strong right arm all her life and a devoted and helpful  grandfather to the little Trumps. Now he is gone.  </P> <P> Ivana has to be very strong herself to go on without her wonderful dad.  </P> <P> IT'S NO secret anymore that French actor Yves Montand entered into an affair  with Marilyn Monroe during the making of their aptly titled 1960 movie "Let's  Make Love." But just how serious was this dangerous liaison? Montand was  married to Simone Signoret, MM to Arthur Miller.  </P> <P> Well, according to a new biography, just published in Europe, it was very  serious indeed. Montand is quoted in "You See, I Have Not Forgotten" by Herve  Harmon and Patrick Rothman: "Not for a second did I envisage breaking with my  wife, but if she had slammed the door, I probably would have made my life with  Marilyn. Or tried to. Perhaps it would have lasted only two or three years. But  what years!"  </P> <P> And despite the fact that their romance came during what is considered to be  the beginning of the end for Marilyn, Montand says: "I knew Marilyn for six  months, and not once did she behave like the unbalanced person people have made  her out to be. . . . Marilyn was an exceptional woman."  </P> <P> This book also traces Simone Signoret's terrible physical decline (she went  somewhat beyond the natural aging process). And the authors opine that Yves'  affair with Marilyn exacerbated her eating, drinking and smoking. Montand  recalls: "What I found hardest to accept was this form of self-destruction. The  more she demolished herself the more I loved her."  </P> <P> Signoret was characteristically Gallic. She was sanguine and sympathetic about  Marilyn and Yves in all her public pronouncements at the time. Years later in  her wonderful autobiography, she maintained this dispassionate distance. But,  according to her friend Catherine Deneuve, "Marilyn remained carved on her face  like an unhealed wound."  </P></p>

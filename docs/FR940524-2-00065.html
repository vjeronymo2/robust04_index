			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With respect to factor (4), the administrative law judge found that Respondent's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> nolo contendere <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  plea to a misdemeanor charge of possession of marijuana was not intended as an admission of guilt. Rather, the plea was entered in an effort to resolve the case without submitting to the risks of litigation. The administrative law judge found the explanations regarding the marijuana, cocaine and methamphetamine of both Mrs. Patwell and Respondent to be credible. With respect to the prescription bottles found in the Patwell residence, the administrative law judge noted that such storage was in violation of DEA regulations. The administrative law judge, however, found convincing Respondent's explanation and concluded that the violation was inadvertent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Turning his attention to factor (5), the administrative law judge noted that regardless of Respondent's lack of wrongdoing with respect to the marijuana, the fact remains that approximately one and one-half pounds of marijuana were found in his home, as were trace amounts of other drugs and drug paraphernalia. The administrative law judge commented that greater diligence on the part of Respondent should be expected. Consequently, the administrative law judge recommended that three conditions be applied to the continuation of Respondent's registration. First, Respondent shall not allow any controlled substances, other than those prescribed by a doctor other than Respondent for a legitimate medical need, to be kept in his home. Second, Respondent must report to the local DEA office and appropriate law enforcement authorities any illegal use of controlled substances by any individual. Third, Respondent must report to the local DEA office and appropriate law enforcement authorities any controlled substances, except those prescribed by a doctor for a legitimate medical need, found in his home. The Deputy Administrator agrees with the administrative law judge that Respondent's registration should not be revoked and adopts his findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommended ruling in its entirety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the Deputy Administrator finds the recommendation of the administrative law judge to be appropriate, this decision should in no way be interpreted as an endorsement of the past behavior of either Mrs. Patwell or Respondent. Respondent's testimony indicates that he recognizes that his failure to take action in the face of his wife's drug abuse was both unprofessional and unacceptable. Respondent's remorse for his past inaction and his apparent commitment to a more responsible future lead to the conclusion that revocation would not be appropriate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104, hereby orders that Steven W. Patwell, M.D.'s DEA Certificate of Registration, BP0597508, be, and it hereby is, continued. This order is effective May 24, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: May 17, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Stephen H.

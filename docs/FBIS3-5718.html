The author of the article notes:    Keeping independence in foreign relations means to establish  and develop relations with other countries on the basis of  complete equality and mutual respect for sovereignty, to fully  exercise sovereignty in external relations and to resolve all  the questions by one's own judgement and decision in the  interests of the revolution in one's country.    Adhering to independence in foreign relations is a  fundamental principle that must be maintained consistently,  first of all, because independence is the life and soul of a  country and a nation. Independence is the first criterion of an  independent and sovereign state. If a country acts under the  baton of others, losing independence, it cannot be called an  independent and sovereign state, though it has power. If  independence is ignored in foreign relations, unequal relations  of domination and subjugation appear and the sovereignty of the  country and the nation is encroached upon and violated.    Keeping independence in foreign relations is a fundamental  principle that must be consistently maintained next because only  when independence is maintained can a successful contribution be  made to the cause of global independence, the common cause of  mankind. An independent world is one free from domination and  subjugation, interference and pressure, a world where all the  countries and nations fully exercise the sovereignty as masters  of their destiny. If the people of each country are to  contribute to the realization of global independence as a member  of the international community, they must always adhere to  independence in foreign relations. Only then there will be in  the world neither commanding and submitting countries nor ruling  and ruled nations, and full equality and freedom of the  countries and nations will be ensured.    The main target of the struggle for making the world  independent is the imperialists and other dominationist forces.  If all the countries and nations firmly maintain independence,  totally reject all forms of interference of outside forces and  do not dance to other's tune nor blindly follow others,  dominationism will become impotent and strong-arm action and the  baton will not work.</p>

			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / High-flyer takes over Mr Ciro Gomes, Brazil's new finance minister, is a high-flying politician with very close links to Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, government candidate and front-runner for the presidential election in October. The new minister is best known for his efficient and honest government of Ceara, a small state in the Brazilian north-east, a region more often associated with bad government and corruption. Now 37, he represents a new crop of Brazilian politicians who remain populist and aware of the importance of the media, but who are less nationalist than past generations. Mr Gomes was born in Sao Paulo but grew up in Ceara, where several family members have held political office. He practised law before switching to politics. In 1988, he was elected mayor of Fortaleza, the Ceara capital, and emerged as a principal follower of Mr Tasso Jereissati, The latter was elected state governor in 1987, modernised its government and balanced its budget. Mr Gomes succeeded as governor in 1990, and continued his policies of controlling public spending and improving government efficiency. This has led to a wave of foreign investment in Ceara and its economic growth has outstripped that of all Brazil by a factor of five in the last seven years. However, opponents argue that it has taken too long for the benefits of growth to reach the poor. The new minister has also won plaudits, and criticism, for his skilful handling of the Brazilian and international media. He is a well-known figure in Brazil, despite the relative obscurity of his state. His media presence will help him continue the work of his predecessor at the finance ministry, Mr Rubens Ricupero, whose work of explaining Brazil's new Real currency to the public, as well as fighting industrial groups wanting to raise prices. He is likely to be weakened, however, by his links to Mr Cardoso. Other candidates are unhappy that one of the presidential front-runner's closest allies has been appointed finance minister so close to the elections. Mr Jereissati is well ahead in opinion polls to secure a second term as governor of Ceara. Both men are key members of the same political party as Mr Cardoso, the social democratic PSDB.</p>

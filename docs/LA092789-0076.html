			<p><P> September 27, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WASHINGTON STATE WINNING DESPITE PROBLEMS  </P> <P> It probably wouldn't be accurate to say that Washington State's football team  thrives on adversity. Nonetheless, the Cougars are winning despite injuries and  off-the-field problems that have plagued them in recent months.  </P> <P> "If I was a rookie head coach, I don't think I could have handled some of the  problems we've had with the maturity I did," Washington State Coach Mike Price  said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Price, whose Cougars will play USC Saturday at Pullman, Wash., would not  discuss the problems that produced embarrassing summer headlines for the  university.  </P> <P> Consider:  </P> <P>  -- Tailback Steve Broussard spent five days in jail, charged with assaulting a  store's night manager in Pullman.  </P> <P>  -- The backup tailback, Rich Swinton, was convicted of fourth-degree assault  for "improperly touching a woman" and was jailed for two days.  </P> <P>  -- Wide receiver Tim Stallworth served 90 days in jail for traffic violations,  including a second offense of driving with a suspended license.  </P> <P>  -- Linebacker Dan Grayson was jailed last spring on assault charges but was  allowed to participate in spring practice.  </P> <P> In a small town such as Pullman, players live in a fishbowl and their  transgressions don't go unnoticed.  </P> <P> Moreover, if these offending athletes had been marginal players, the cases  probably wouldn't have attracted so much attention.  </P> <P> But Broussard, who played at L.A.'s Manual Arts High School, was the Pacific  10's leading rusher last year with 1,280 yards. He has been hampered recently  by a hamstring injury and might not play extensively against USC.  </P> <P> Although he started only two games last season, Swinton, who attended Montclair  Prep in Van Nuys, rushed for 1,018 yards as the Cougars went 9-3.  </P> <P> He also has a hamstring injury and isn't expected to play against USC.  </P> <P> Stallworth, also from Montclair Prep, is not injured, however and is Washington  State's leading receiver with 20 catches for a 19.4-yard average and four  touchdowns.  </P> <P> Grayson is a starting linebacker.  </P> <P> The problems of the summer aside, WSU is playing without quarterback Brad  Gossen, who suffered torn cartilage in his left thumb, his passing hand, two  weeks ago against Oregon State.  </P> <P> Gossen was a teammate of USC wide receiver Gary Wellman at Westlake High  School.  </P> <P> And 6-foot-4, 288-pound tackle Tony Savage, who has been mentioned as a  candidate for the Outland Trophy, is recovering from an ankle injury.  </P> <P> Yet the Cougars prosper. They are unbeaten in four games and are riding a  nine-game winning streak, its best since it went to the Rose Bowl in 1930.  </P> <P> "We've had all kinds of adversity," said Price, the former Weber State coach  who replaced Dennis Erickson, now at the University of Miami. "But we have a  tough team and nothing is going to stop the players from reaching their goals."  </P> <P> USC Coach Larry Smith, whose team is 2-1 after a 42-3 victory over Ohio State  Saturday, has reason to be concerned about USC's first road game.  </P> <P> Even though USC has a commanding 40-5-4 advantage in the series, it has only a  3-2 edge -- there have been two ties -- in games played in Pullman.  </P> <P> "Washington State is on a roll and, as their coach said, they've gone through a  lot of adversity which has made then mentally tough," Smith said. "They're  playing with a lot of confidence.  </P> <P> "They have great speed at the skill positions. And they have a stretch-type  offense with the passing game and a ton of formations and sometimes no backs at  all.  </P> <P> "On defense, all four of their guys in the down positions are seniors. They  play the run really well and are excellent pass rushers. Overall, they've got  14 interceptions to lead the country."  </P> <P> However, the Cougars have had plenty of opportunities for interceptions, having  played Brigham Young and Oregon State, both passing teams, along with Idaho and  Wyoming.  </P> <P> Price acknowledged as much, saying, "Our first season, the passing season, is  over. Now we play the running and passing teams."  </P> <P> Trojan Notes  </P> <P> Larry Smith said that the cast will be removed from the injured thumb of  tailback Scott Lockwood, but Lockwood is not expected to play against  Washington State. . . . Redshirt freshman Aaron Garcia has replaced Brad Gossen  at quarterback for Washington State. Since taking over in the third game, when  Gossen was injured, Garcia has completed 53.7% of his passes for 322 yards,  four touchdowns and three interceptions.  </P> <P> USC quarterback Todd Marinovich has a sprained left wrist, an injury he  suffered against Ohio State. "I'm most concerned that the injury is on his  throwing arm, and you can't throw a pass with a stiff wrist," Smith said. . . .  Saturday's game will be televised by Channel 7, starting at 12:30 p.m. The game  was originally scheduled for 2 p.m.  </P></p>

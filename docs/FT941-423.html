			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Arts: Today's Television CBC1's new current affairs programme with shorter items, Here And Now (7.30) reports on chocoholics, and what can be done to lighten the impact of next week's tax increases. What with the Question Time job going to a Dimbleby, and Jeremy Paxman, according to scuttlebutt, holding out for too high a fee as questionmaster on the about-to-be revived University Challenge, it seems that the search for a role other than Newsnight presenter for Paxo continues. Today he presents Elizabeth The Last: The Radical Option (8.10 BBC2). This is a pilot for what could become an occasional series. Professor Stephen Haseler puts the case for a British republic. As part of Channel 4's French season Dispatches reports on a year in the life of a tough school in Paris where teachers have to contend with superglue in the keyholes and pupils armed with tear gas bombs (9.00). Ironically French Letters (9.45) is one of those rare programmes not about condoms. It offers a picture of the 'other' France: rundown housing estates and illegal immigrants.</p>

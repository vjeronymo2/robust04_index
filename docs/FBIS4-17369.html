			<p>BFN     [Text] By 1999, Russia will have to bring up the standards  of its offshore oil exploration and development facilities to  meet the requirements of the Solace '74 international convention  and the global maritime safety communications system, said an  executive from Rosneft, a Russian holding company managing state  shares in the country's oil enterprises.    Otherwise Russia will lose its contracts for projects  outside  its territorial waters, Gennadiy Elefteriadi told Interfax.    He said Russia would have to buy INMARSAT global satellite  communications systems joined to the GPS-GLONAS navigation  system, satellite monitoring systems, automatic compact ships'  radio stations, etc. Russia today produces no such equipment  meeting international standards, although, according to Rosneft  experts, it is able to if it buys foreign licenses.    Russia nowadays possesses more than 140 vessels and other  facilities for offshore oil exploration and development, more  than 20 of which operate outside Russian waters, including in  the Gulf of Mexico, the Middle East Gulf, and on the shelf of  Vietnam.</p>

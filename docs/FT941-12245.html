			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Major set to resist right wing calls for reshuffle Mr John Major, the prime minister, is expected to warn the right wing of the Tory party to stop undermining his leadership when he meets MPs from the 92 Group today. The 92 Group deputation, led by Sir George Gardiner, will press for promotion for up to eight rightwing ministers, half of whom would enter the cabinet. But last night the Tory right was backing away from demands for an early cabinet reshuffle after Mr Major made it clear that he will not be hurried. The group's main aim is to secure promotion for Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, who is widely regarded as the most plausible rightwing leadership contender. Friends of the prime minister said he had agreed to meet the deputation to show that his door is open to all party sections. But he will tell Sir George that a reshuffle is 'far from his mind'. The right believes that such a reshuffle would bring fresh blood into the party leadership ahead of the local and European elections in May and June. But support has ebbed since the demand was disclosed at the weekend. Many Tory MPs said that it had merely reinforced the image of a party in turmoil. One prominent Eurosceptic said the demand for a reshuffle had distracted attention from the real divisions in the party over Europe and taxation policy. Others said it reflected continuing disillusionment with the prime minister's leadership and anger over his failure to take a firm grip of the party. 'The prime minister cannot regain the support of the right unless he rules out a return to the European Monetary System - ever - and pledges to cut taxes to the 1992 level before the next election,' said one. The prime minister appeared to have sustained little damage from a weekend interview in which Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, was said to have described Mr Major as 'weak and hopeless'. Most MPs said the article had damaged Mr Lamont more than the prime minister and senior Conservatives rallied to give public support, including Mr John Redwood, the Welsh secretary. However, the upheaval in the party was underlined by Lord Tebbit, a key indicator of opinion on the Thatcherite right, who warned MPs not to panic. Writing in the Daily Mail, Lord Tebbit said the economy was likely to continue growing, but added that 'many Conservative MPs are determined to panic again, as they did when they overthrew Margaret Thatcher. They would do well to take a grip on themselves'. Lamont attack, Page 7 Government close to retreat on single-tier councils, Page 20</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 22 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- Manuel Camacho  Solis, government commissioner for peace and reconciliation in  Chiapas, denied today that he seeks to be a presidential  candidate in the upcoming 21 August general elections.    Local newspaper reports had reported the possibility that  Camacho might be one of the contenders in view of his primary  role in the Chiapas peace process and that political analysts  had included him in the list of "presidential hopefuls."    "The decision I am making might disappoint some people, but  I  am certain that they would reproach me if I were to place any  other interest above the topic of peace," Camacho stated in  statements to newsmen. He also dismissed the possibility of  occupying a Senate seat and said he will dedicate his efforts to  peace in Chiapas, where an armed group occupied several towns  and attacked a garrison early this year, prompting the Mexican  Army to step in.    Camacho was appointed by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari  as commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas on 10  January. After intense negotiations he achieved a preliminary  agreement which will be analyzed by the government and the armed  group.    "Without this (political) definition, it would be difficult  to continue my work in favor of peace in Chiapas," Camacho  added. His position is independent of the government [words  indistinct] refusal to participate in the elections. The  commissioner noted that "if it is noted that my priorities  include being a presidential candidate, it could harm the peace  process" in Chiapas where over 100 persons were killed.    Some 42 million voters, a little less than half of the  country's population, will go to the polls on 21 August to elect  a new president, new deputies, and part of the Senate.    The candidates in the elections will be Luis Donaldo Colosio  of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, Diego Fernandez  de Cevallos of the National Action Party, and Cuauhtemoc  Cardenas of the Party of the Democratic Revolution. There are  two female candidates: Cecilia Soto of the Labor Party and  Marcela Lombardo of the Popular Socialist Party. Other hopefuls  are Rafael Aguilar of the Cardenist Front for National  Reconstruction Party, Pablo Emilio Madero of the National  Opposition National Union, Alvaro Perez of the Authentic Party  of the Mexican Revolution, and Jorge Gonzalez of the Ecologist  Party of Mexico.</p>

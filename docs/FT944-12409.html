			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / International Company News: UBS 'unlikely' to match last year's record Union Bank of Switzerland, which is in the midst of a proxy battle with its largest shareholder over its business strategy, has said its 1994 net income will be lower than the record SFr2.27bn (Dollars 1.8bn) it made last year. 'Last year's excellent result is unlikely to be reached,' UBS, Switzerland's largest bank, said in a statement on third-quarter trading. Earlier, it had left open the possibility of matching the 1993 result. The bank blamed unfavourable market conditions for a decline in third-quarter profits. No figures were given, but it said both net interest income and trading income were down, although the trading result was 'substantially higher' than in the previous quarter. Fee and commission income were said to be 'excellent', marking the only contrast with the third-quarter report of Credit Suisse which said last week its commissions business suffered a 'slight downturn'. UBS said commissions from its corporate finance business were unsatisfactory. Expenses were down noticeably. As in the case of Credit Suisse, bad loan provisions were reduced but remained at a high level. UBS has called an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders for November 22 to vote on its proposal to convert all registered shares into bearer shares. The par value on the registered is one-fifth that on the bearers, giving an investment in them much more voting power than the same stake in bearers. The proposal is opposed by BK Vision, an investment fund which has a large holding in the registered shares and is seeking to rally a majority of votes to make substantial board changes at the next annual meeting in April. Operating profit at Maculan, the Austrian construction group with large operations in eastern Germany, plunged in the first half by 42 per cent to Sch81.7m (Dollars 7.69m). It also forecast lower net income in the full year. Turnover was up 14 per cent to Sch6.9bn, due to a 19 per cent increase in Germany, which accounted for just over half of group revenue. The group said the decline in operating profit was partly due to delays in Russian housing projects for returning soldiers. The extra costs in the Russian projects will be borne by the customer but this will be reflected only in next year's earnings after they are completed.</p>

			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: NONFICTION  </P> <P> THE IVORY TRADE: Music and the Business of Music at the Van Cliburn  International Piano Competition by Joseph Horowitz (Summit Books: $21.95; 290  pp.).  </P> <P> Former New York Times music critic Joseph Horowitz could well have titled his  fascinating new book "The Politics of Music." Horowitz reports on piano  competitions and critiques performances, but at bottom, "The Ivory Trade" is an  extended condemnation of the way the classical music world finds and promotes  promising young pianists: by staging grueling, high-pressure, sports-like  contests that appear to damage as many careers as they make. The Van Cliburn  competition was born in 1958, months after Cliburn had won, to enormous  international acclaim, the first Tchaikovsky piano competition in Moscow. A  high-profile American counterpart no doubt seemed a good idea at the time --  Horowitz cites the furious cultural race between the United States and the  U.S.S.R. that began the previous year with Sputnik -- but by the 1970s, the  quadrennial, Fort Worth-based event had become as much an affair of money,  social climbing and media stardom as of keyboard talent. Horowitz forcefully  documents an opinion best expressed by cellist and teacher Gregor Piatigorsky:  "It cannot be useful to discourage a hundred merely to encourage one." Chris  Goodrich  </P></p>

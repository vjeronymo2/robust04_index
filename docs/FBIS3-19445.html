Batu quelled fears that Turkish involvement in the Balkans,  which was Ottoman domain for 500 years, would be a contribution  toward peace and not conquest [as received].    A meeting is expected to be held in New York between U.N.  Peace Forces Operations (UNPROFOR) Commander Kofi Hannan [name  as received] and Batu.    Batu is expected to reiterate Turkey's readiness to  contribute with a mechanized battalion of 1,000 troops, which  could be deployed within a week.    Batu also said that Ankara favors a solution which would  allow the deployment of Turkish forces in the already secured  regions in Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

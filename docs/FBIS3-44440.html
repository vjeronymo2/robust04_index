The  municipality will create conditions in order to realize the  desire for cooperation.

After hearing this introduction, Mr. Guo Henian expressed  great determination and interest in the plan. He said: I was  very impressed with Mayor Zhang Lichang's introduction. My  intentions to cooperate with Tianjin are late. I will  immediately take action not only to personally invest money in  Tianjin but also look into opportunities by going to Tianjin  with some large companies and corporations of the United States  and Japan. During the call, both guest and host talked  specifically about renovation of residential houses, outdated  enterprises and about building the municipality's  infrastructure.

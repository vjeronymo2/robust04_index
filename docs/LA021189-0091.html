			<p><P> February 11, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREP BASKETBALL;  </P> <P> SUNSET LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> FOUNTAIN VALLEY TIES UP LEAGUE RACE WITH COMEBACK  </P> <P> Fountain Valley High School scored eight consecutive points in the final 2  minutes of play to defeat Huntington Beach, 72-64, Friday and create a  three-way tie for the Sunset League championship.  </P> <P> Despite the loss, Huntington Beach, Ocean View and Edison are the co-champions  of the six-team league with 7-3 records. Edison will advance to the Southern  Section 5-A playoffs as the league's No. 1 entry, followed by Huntington Beach  (No. 2, 5-AA playoffs) and Ocean View (No. 3, 5-A).  </P> <P> School administrators used a coin flip to determine the team's designations for  the playoffs that begin Wednesday. Edison earned the top designation when Coach  Jon Borchert was the odd man among the trio of coaches in a three-way coin  flip.  </P> <P> Then, another coin flip was used to determine the No. 2 and No. 3 bids. Jim  Harris, Ocean View coach, called "heads" and Huntington Beach got the second  bid.  </P> <P> "We play two and a half months and then decide things by flipping a quarter,"  said Roy Miller, Huntington Beach coach. "At worst, I saw us losing the game,  losing the flips and having to play Saddleback or Mater Dei on the round in the  first round."  </P> <P> Edison (14-12, 7-3) is guaranteed a home game in the first round.Ocean View  (17-7, 7-3) is guaranteed a road game by losing the flip. Pairings will be  announced Sunday at the Southern Section office in Cerritos.  </P> <P> Of course, Huntington Beach (12-11, 7-3) could have avoided the suspense by  winning its season finale against Fountain Valley and claiming its first league  title since 1985 outright.  </P> <P> But Fountain Valley (18-6, 6-4) outplayed Huntington Beach in the second half  and gained some much-needed momentum going into the playoffs after losing four  of its last five games before beating the Oilers. Fountain Valley is expected  to gain an at-large entry into the playoffs.  </P> <P> Mike Cook and Doug Weaver, the standout receivers on Fountain Valley's Division  I championship football team, played big roles on the basketball court. Weaver  made four three-point shots and finished with 16 points. Fountain Valley made  seven three-point shots.  </P> <P> Cook had 12 rebounds and scored nine points, including a breakaway layup with  29 seconds remaining to push Fountain Valley ahead, 70-64. Center Mike Merli  added 18 points in what Coach Dave Brown called his best game of the season.  </P> <P> "That was a good win in a big-time game," Brown said. "We've shown the ability  to come back all year long and did it again tonight."  </P> <P> Huntington Beach was cruising with a seven-point lead in the second quarter but  the Oilers also had three starters with three fouls each. Fountain Valley  trimmed the deficit to a point, 33-32, at halftime, and Merli gave the Barons  their first lead to open the second.  </P> <P> "We had a chance to put them away in the first half, but they got back in it  and that was the key to the game," Miller said. "We didn't contain their inside  game, and they shot a lot better than the first time we played them."  </P> <P> Forward Jeff Long led Huntington Beach with 21 points and scored 14 of the  Oilers' 31 points in the second half before fouling out.  </P> <P> Edison 62, Westminster 36 -- Art Baird scored 14 points and Tom Tyler and Brian  Murphy each added 10 points as Edison (14-12, 7-3) earned a share of the league  championship.  </P></p>

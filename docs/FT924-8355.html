			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / International Company News: SNC declines to CDollars 2.8m SNC, the international engineering and construction group, saw earnings fall to CDollars 2.8m (USDollars 2.2m), or 19 cents a share, in the first nine months, from CDollars 6.1m, or 51 cents, a year earlier. It attributed the decline to the North American recession and delays in overseas work. Revenues were CDollars 492m, against CDollars 370m. Third-quarter profit was CDollars 2.1m, or 14 cents a share, against CDollars 2.4m, or 19 cents, on revenues of CDollars 173m, against CDollars 151m. SNC has cut engineering and administrative staff and will feel the financial benefits next year. Its manufacturing activities have declined to about 25 per cent of the total business. It is looking for more international work and has won engineering-construction contracts in Mexico, Africa, Indonesia and Russia.</p>

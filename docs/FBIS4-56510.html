			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 4 May (NA) -- The Grand Front (FG) and  the Socialist Unity (US) today agreed to create a Political  Action Commission that will outline a program of cooperation and  the election strategy for an eventual alliance, with an eye to  the 1995 elections.    In addition, the leaders of the two coalitions decided that  their members in the Constituent Assembly, which is to be held  in the cities of Santa Fe and Parana, will work "together," and  thus the two blocs will hold their first meeting in Congress on  6 April.    The resolutions were adopted during a meeting at FG  headquarters between the FG and the US. Attending for the FG  were: Fernando Solanas, Carlos Chacho Alvarez, Patricio  Echegaray, Marcelo Vensentini, Carlos Auyero, Anibal Ibarra, and  Mary Sanchez; and for the US: Norberto La Porta, Alfredo Bravo,  Hector Bravo, Guillermo Estevez Boero, Ernesto Jaimovich, Mario  Mazitelli, and Jose Seoane.</p>

			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Coal sell-off 'may hurt BR freight' PRIVATISING British Coal could damage prospects for selling British Rail's bulk freight operation, according to Coal UK, a Financial Times newsletter, John Willman writes. The Queen's Speech next week is expected to include legislation on privatising British coal and BR. BR privatisation will be achieved in stages, with profitable divisions such as Railfreight and Trainload Freight sold first. But Coal UK warns that the marketability of Trainload Freight could be threatened if further pits were closed to make British Coal attractive enough for privatisation. Almost two thirds of Trainload Freight income comes from moving coal to power stations and other user plant. Coal UK predicts that movements could fall by more than half to 35m tonnes by 1995 and a further 10m to 20m tonnes by the end of the decade. The tonnage shipped by Trainload Freight has already fallen by 20 per cent over the last 10 years as a result of pit closures. Further closures of around half the remaining pits - just under 50 in number  -are likely by the end of the decade if British Coal is to be profitable.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview of Security Forces Commander Juris Vectirans by </F> Andris Jakubans and Eriks Hanbergs: "Juris Vectirans--Only to  Andris Jakubans and Eriks Hanbergs"]    [Text]    [NEATKARIGA CINA] You are the leader of the type of agency  that appears dangerous to some, and maybe even ready for the  dustbin. Therefore, the first question is quite simple: How many  times have you been shot at?    [Vectirans] I remember the last time quite well. It was New  Year's. My brother-in-law. With a champagne cork.    But, seriously, there have been critical situations, of  course. I served in the militia; in the Internal Affairs  Ministry my work was connected with examining criminal activity  at various levels. I have been shot at, but, thank God, never  been hit.    [NEATKARIGA CINA] What is the feeling at that moment, when  the bullet goes past?    [Vectirans] It is, of course, not pleasant. I heard the most  buzzing bullets in January of '91. Back then I was carrying out  the duties of the deputy commander of the government guard  service. In carrying out my responsibilities there occured a  contact with OMON troops. When the takeover of the Internal  Affairs Ministry occured I found myself at the Cabinet of  Ministers building. From there I repeatedly went to ministry  building to evaluate the situation and to resolve it. Bullets  whined past; but I did not act like a hero, either in the  classical nor in any different sense, when I did what I had to  do, and that's all.    [NEATKARIGA CINA] But you are not like the "Brave Soldier  Shweek?"    [Vectirans] Certainly not, although I like very much this  Haek character. I have found that book again, so that I could  read it again. It often occurs to me that a colonel in the  Latvian army is injured more than in the Soviet times, being a  Soviet officer.    [NEATKARIGA CINA] In the days of the barricades [January  1991  and later] someone wrote on the Riga railway station platform,  in Russian: Let's Hang Vectirans!    [Vectirans] Ha! I guess those who wrote it didn't do as well  with the rope!    Of course, my connection to the events of the time of  Awakening was close. Those years in my life are the brightest  and remain best in my memory. Of course I am not thinking about  my personal life, since the birth of my second daughter in '89  also was a huge event in my life; as a rank and file member of  the Popular Front I obeyed my leader, Dainis Ivans, in his  appeal to enrich Latvian families.    Yes, time of Awakening was rich in events. We began to  organize volunteer police formations in the self-defense units.  That functioned successfully and for some time, causing alarm on  the side of the imperial defenders.    [NEATKARIGA CINA] The public seems to know you well, but  they  would certainly like to know even more.    [Vectirans] I was born in '53. October. In a good time,  after  the death of the despot Stalin. My generation must work off the  difficulties of that time, to develop Latvia into a powerful  country.    I was born in Zemgale, in the famous port city of  Jaunjelgava, into a provincial intelligentsia family. I studied  there until I turned 18, then I enrolled in the army college,  but due to circumstances I ended up in active military service.  I served in the USSR Internal Affairs Ministry's special  motorized militia unit. I ended my service in Riga as a  sergeant, group commander.    Then there was work in the ranks of the Internal Affairs  Ministry posts, teaching in the militia school and in the USSR  Internal Affairs Ministry school in Lviv. I also finished at the  Higher School of the Internal Affairs Ministry. Various  promotions, courses, also highest academics in Kiev.    Among other things, I arrived in Ukraine at the end of May  '90, so from a country that had declared its independence from  the USSR. I was accepted with understanding, well-treated,  perhaps also because of my personal characteristics, as my  country's representatives, as a Latvian officer.    [NEATKARIGA CINA] We have it on good authority that you have  in your house an historical sword and that your ancestors were  policemen.    [Vectirans] I have many swords, but the one to which you are  referring is unique. It belonged to one of our relatives, a  cavalryman who was awarded the Order of Lacplesis, third class.  He managed to save himself from the repressions, perhaps because  he de-mobilized from the army in '33.    I have read in his documents, by the way, that Latvian  officers in the Tsar's army declared their support for the  establishment of the Latvian state. And these officers wore a  ribbon in the colors of the flag of Latvia on their uniforms,  thereby publicly displaying their stand. To join the ranks of  the Latvian army, an affadavit from several colleagues in the  service was required, attesting to the person's having  demonstrated a nationalist orientation. (I, too, when I assumed  the post of First Police Battalion commander, was strongly  vetted in a meeting; they took into account sponsor affadavits,  although I was the Internal Affairs Ministry's senior cadre  officer with 17 years of service.)    [NEATKARIGA CINA] How did your path as a Popular Fronter  start?    [Vectirans] I participated in meetings and the like, along  with my wife and oldest daughter. I wanted to be together with  my people, to feel the oneness.    [NEATKARIGA CINA] Did you arrive as a private person or as  an  officer?    [Vectirans] Back then I was an Internal Affairs service  officer and the uniform was military: the uniform of a USSR army  officer. It was just by accident that I did not have to stand in  the human chain at the Monument of Freedom and interfere with  the right of the Latvian people to honor our most sacred symbol.  For that I am thankful to fate, for I cannot even imagine how  much strength it would have required within me to fail to carry  out the order of the commander of the day.    [NEATKARIGA CINA] Yes, it was a time when many militiamen  had  a moment to examine their consciences.    [Vectirans] Many militia workers have told me about their  feelings at that time. But many carried out their duties at the  Monument of Freedom back then with great joy. But we all will  have our time to be sifted into history's granaries and we each  will receive our judgment.    My daughter was a student in the nineth grade in the First  High School of Jelgava, and I joined the Popular Front group at  this school, with the teachers. My comrades in the service knew  little of this. But my stand was clear to them.    [NEATKARIGA CINA] Have you met with your service comrades  from that time?    [Vectirans] My current service duties are such that I do  have  the opportunity to meet former, I do not want to call them all  comrades, but more often colleagues. We understand  one another, and we do not have many disagreements, if we are  not talking about the most important things.    [NEATKARIGA CINA] Perhaps you have arrested some of them,  the  former ones.    [Vectirans] Only Parmyonov was arrested and tried. There is  not a single document which at least analyzes the activities of  those Internal Affairs Ministry workers who were involved in  supporting the imperial system, their actions, inactions or  offered assistance in the dramatic events of that time, when the  existence of the Latvian state was decided.    [NEATKARIGA CINA] But still, you as Security Agency leader  have such a balance, of course?    [Vectirans] Hmmm. Many think that the Security Agency  operates like the one-time KGB, but that is not so. Our  functions include protection of the highest officials, receiving  foreign delegations and guaranteeing their security, guarding  embassies and other nationally significant objects, and, of  course, operational activities to ensure all of that.    But, if you refer in your question to activities against  elements, organizations hostile to the Latvian state, then I can  say that there are no specific national policies on this issue.  There is completely uncoordinated information collection by  various state organizations.    [NEATKARIGA CINA] How was it that the Internal Affairs  Ministry was unable to locate Mr. Rucs, while your Security  Agency men did so without a problem?    [Vectirans] There was nothing illusory or abstract in that  situation. Everyone acted much more simply and prosaically than  perhaps might be imagined, but not simply.    [NEATKARIGA CINA] Was [Internal Affairs Minister] Girts  Kristovskis jealous of you for such a turn of events?    [Vectirans] I think that Girts is not trampled down by this  character flaw common among some men. And in this event there  was no basis for jealousy. We joined the operation at the  direction of the President, but the successful conclusion was  determined by both the Agency's specific character and by the  prevalence of good contacts with all organizations.    [NEATKARIGA CINA] I once read this conclusion in the history  of assassination attempts: in the de Gaulle era French security  agency workers trained in America, but remained faithful to  their system and boasted that they guarded de Gaulle, but not  the American Kennedy. Where are your workers trained? What do  your people gather from international experience?    [Vectirans] We are constantly improving ourselves. I, too,  even though I have a degree with the highest legal education and  experience working in the Internal Affairs Ministry. I have  studied in many courses which were organized at the request of  our government by foreign specialists, but we must continue to  improve our model.    [NEATKARIGA CINA] You were also trained in America. How did  the American service and police differ?    [Vectirans] We acquired experience in a similar service,  which makes arrangements for national leaders, the top official,  organizing a representative task. These jobs, you can say, have  a visible part that looks similar, two or three strapping men  walking with the person being guarded, but of course there is a  whole complex range of tasks being performed, which are carried  out by other particular agencies. The experiences I acquired in  America come in handy.    [NEATKARIGA CINA] Those who have seen the famous film  "Bodyguard" for the first time completely understand how  complicated this profession is.    [Vectirans] And they were also convinced of how unsuccessful  it is, if it is not connected with the other services. The  success or lack of success in guarding people is always directly  dependent on the other security agencies.    [NEATKARIGA CINA] Your's are strong?    [Vectirans] Developed, but not to the point that we could  say  that in this area nothing more needs to be done.    The one-time KGB carried out their job well and effectively  enough. The Soviet era personal protection system was only a  small part of the totalitarian regime's system, which ensured  its existence. Now a few journalists wonder why nothing was seen  before, but now suddenly it is seen! We must remember that that  system carried out complete scrutiny and control of society,  both spectators and the composition of people's groups were  given out in doses. Even in May Day demonstrations marchers were  specially selected from factories.    My wife told me that at VEF they consciensciously selected  marchers. Those who did not carry out this task were not  permitted at the demonstrations the next time. Yes, the KGB,  which in principle managed public opinion, actively operated in  factories and the larger enterprises.    [NEATKARIGA CINA] Does such a system also operate now?    [Vectirans] No. But still, caution is necessary. We actively  cooperate with government institutions with similar functions,  with the Internal Affairs and Defense ministries, with the Home  Guard. The successful conclusion to the Pope's visit was  attributable to our agency, the aforementioned department, of  all the country and, I will not be particularly bashful if I  mention to a certain extent also my modest contribution. The  stress of preparing for that was terrific, a big job was carried  out, and everything, with the Lord's help, succeeded as  befitting, not to mention that the level of threat was  sufficient. That is proof that the country's security system is  functioning.    [NEATKARIGA CINA] Our photographers were not satisfied with  being permitted to photograph the Pope only from a great  distance. That was not just the caprice of the press this time;  this visit was a distinguished event in Latvian history.    [Vectirans] Mmm, yes. There will always be someone who is  dissatisfied, including journalists. We tried to take into  account their wishes also, of course, for the closer they got to  the Pope, the closer they wanted to get.    [NEATKARIGA CINA] The successful security for the Pope's  visit truly was your agency's most satisfying hour. Afterwords  the press reported that Vectirans was walking around with a  smile on his face. But how did you yourself perceive the arrival  of such a high-ranking person?    [Vectirans] The groundwork was done very carefully, the  stress is considerable, but there is satisfaction after  successful visits. The Pope's visit was unique, leaving me with  a deep personal impression. Finding myself next to the Holy  Father, that was a unique event for me.    [NEATKARIGA CINA] What are your contacts with those security  agencies which escort high-ranking officials here?  Psychological, practical?    [Vectirans] In August '91, after the Putsch events, when  Russian Federation leader Yeltsin found himself in Latvia, and  that was kept secret, our Security Agency also participated in  protecting him. The situation had not yet been completely  resolved, and therefore was stressful; we were in full combat  readiness. Yeltsin's bodyguards were significantly better  equipped than we were. We adopted their recommendations in a  business-like way.    We have always had collegial relations with our  brothers-in-arms, although, for instance, the Americans really  have a lot to be proud of (we, too, have no shortage of pride,  either), a high level of professionalism, sufficient autonomy to  resolve our questions.    [NEATKARIGA CINA] Did you communicate in English?    [Vectirans] Yes, quite successfully, using a translator.    [NEATKARIGA CINA] In Latvia arguments have flashed up over  independence, subordination, and cooperation, also regarding the  Security Agency. How independent are you? To whom are you  subordinated? With whom do you cooperate? How much are you  permitted to say about all that? Also about those altogether  behind-the-scenes brawls?    [Vectirans] I would say that real battles happen, not just  brawls! I probably do not even know all of it, but that is a  matter for the politicians who must after all heed our  professional viewpoints to develop a model appropriate to  Latvia. The Security Agency grew out of the First Police  Battalion, which appeared as part of the Internal Affairs  Ministry and was the first national armed organization. In the  time of Awakening it was a strikingly national unit. During the  August Putsch the battalion succeeded in escaping physical  losses (but not material ones), maintained itself as an  organizatio and developed; the Supreme Council's guard service  was established, and autonomous, independent organization which  later was transformed into the Security Agency. We are a  constituent part of the National Armed Forces.    [NEATKARIGA CINA] Who is your commander?    [Vectirans] The Security Agency is subordinated to the  President of Latvia as the Commander in Chief of the National  Armed Forces. We actively cooperate with the other organizations.    Yes, but rumors the reorganization of the Security Agency  are  not without basis. Once the Internal Affairs Ministry was viewed  as stagnant and a program was worked out to reorganize it. The  Security Agency needed to secure a bloc more connected to state  sovereignty, but the Internal Affairs Ministry was in its direct  competence, the battle against crime and so forth. Now we, who  have proven by our actions that we are powers faithful to the  Latvian state are being reformed. Still, reforms are necessary  in all of the system.    [NEATKARIGA CINA] Perhaps because you are working too well?    [Vectirans] If it were only so, then I could answer the  question differently. The classical variant has been  established: the Internal Affairs Ministry, the Defense  Ministry, the Home Guard (a new organization, which they may  also grab hold of and liquidate soon?). The job is done  energetically. Security Police are foreseen within the Internal  Affairs Ministry. All that's left is to wish them well in  actively working to protect Latvia's sovereignty!    [NEATKARIGA CINA] But still, what is your view of the way in  which we should move in this instance?    [Vectirans] The country must have permanent service with the  task of carrying out a complex variety of tasks, including  special ones, to guard the independence of the state of Latvia,  the people's freedom. These last words must be the guiding motto  of this service.    Our organization's work could be included within this  complex. In no way can it be found within the Internal Affairs  Ministry, at least in the near term. It [the Internal Affairs  Minstry] already now carries on operations, inquiries and  investigations inside and outside the country's territory; it  has prisons and its own army subordinated to it. All that it is  missing is its own judiciary, and then it would be a complete  model of Stalin's Security Ministry. That would be dangerouis to  the Republic of Latvia, to the renewal of democracy. I have  already expressed my ideas to the President, the Prime Minister,  and the Chairman of the Saeima.    We must bring into order the penal (prisons) system and  subordinate it to the Justice Ministry, investigations to the  Procuracy and the financial police to the Finance Ministry, to  decentralize powers of repression. The powers of repression are  particularly unacceptable if the Internal Affairs Ministry is  led by politicians, who, whether they want to or not, more or  less, will be led by their party interests.    [NEATKARIGA CINA] You were one of those who arrested  [Communist Party Secretary Alfreds] Rubiks after the Putsch,  placing irons on his arms...    [Vectirans] No, I determined that, evaluating the situation  as a professional, that it was not necessary to place this  person in irons.    [NEATKARIGA CINA] Among other things the Generals were  complaining that the irons placed on Mr. Rucs scraped his upper  arms.    [Vectirans] Mr. Rucs is a leader in the civilian  administrator and perhaps he has different rules and regulations  than we soldiers.    Yes, but regarding the arrest of Rubiks I can tell you  plainly only that I cannot say much, because the legal  proceedings are continuing and I have not yet given my testimony.    [NEATKARIGA CINA] It is clear how you two met on that August  day, but at least tell us about how you parted back then!    [Vectirans] Rather lyrically. Yes, there were certain  emotions and not negative ones alone. That day was very  turbulent overall. While we were still in the former [Communist]  party central committee building, we received information that  OMON was preparing to arrive, to liberate the building and those  arrested in it. We arrested Rubiks are were preparing to leave  in a mostly unknown direction. Even I had in mind a certain  place, but at the last moment we ended up in another. In  addition, it was 23 August, a very significant day to the  Latvian people [anniversary of the signing of the  Molotov-Ribbentrop pact]. I also wanted to be together with  everyone elst at the Monument of Freedom, and we were hurrying.  There were several incidents. Yes, perhaps some day I will be  able to talk about it all more deeply.    [NEATKARIGA CINA] In the Ulmanis era, it turned out that  Latvia was a diplomatic and spying center. Are there any  espionage services operating? Is the government able to control  it at all? It sometimes seems that the Russian service operates  completely in the open.    [Vectirans] I must be circumspect in what a I say. In  general  I could say this: Questions must be resolved more quickly about  the withdrawal of the Russian army in planned steps, for that is  connected with handing over certain positions (in a secret way)  in the tossed-off territory. If we can do it that way, then why  not withdraw? Some sort of planning can be seen. Would positions  be sufficiently strengthened? There is food for thought here.    [NEATKARIGA CINA] Could a secret police be established in  Latvia?    [Vectirans] In the era of Latvia there were the secret  police, the political administration and the security police.  Three different names, but in reality the Internal Affairs  Ministry political administration.    Among other things I can say that the are no [former]  Chekhists working in the political administration of Latvia.    [NEATKARIGA CINA] Was Fridriksons a shining personality?    [Vectirans] Other countries used the fruits of his labors.  His workers were in other institutions, carrying out collosal  work. I think that Latvia must remember its patriots, such as  these Fridriksons people.    The practice of the special services of other countries is  to  utilize professionals for the benefit of the state. And done  correctly. Latvia is not so rich to throw around professionals.  Another thing, I do not think that, for instance, Dzerzhinsky's  students would operate in the Latvian political adminstration.  Please, God, save us from Dzerzhinsky's grandchildren  working in our security police!    [NEATKARIGA CINA] How is it with the selection of personnel?  What are the principles for selection? How does one become  persuaded that such grandchildren of Dzerzhinsky will  not be able to infiltrate? Can you think about that and sleep  peacefully at night?    [Vectirans] I am not tormented by sleeplessness; the agency  has accustomed me to sleeping in any manner. But Latvia is not  to the point where Vectirans can sleep peacefully.    The first and most important criterion for choosing  personnel  is loyalty to the Latvian state. Also professional fitness and  preparation, of course, but the determining factor is whether  this person is a Latvian patriot. In my opinion the approach to  it is still overly superficial, formal. Although for me as a  soldier, the survival of the Latvian state, speaking without  particular emotion, is a matter of honor.    [NEATKARIGA CINA] In selecting employees have you sometimes  made mistakes?    [Vectirans] Unfortunately, yes.    [NEATKARIGA CINA] What do you do with them? Deport them?    [Vectirans] There are various methods. Generally I am led by  the interests of the agency and the demands of the situation,  based on the law.    [NEATKARIGA CINA] What do you do in instances of  imcompatiblity?    [Vectirans] That has happened and it is a specific  circumstance. The mutual compatibility of people in carrying out  the agency's duties is very important. If that is missing then  the problem must be resolved in an ethically correct way.  Everyone must understand that protection is not necessary just  for its own sake, but because the bodyguard carries out duties  important to the state and our duty is to secure them, correctly  and inconspicuously.    [NEATKARIGA CINA] There are many military units in Riga and  every company has its own security service. The rackets are  operating. The disorder in this area appears dangerous. Are you  on top of the situation?    [Vectirans] Being concerned with personal protection,  companies hope that they will thereby be guaranteed security.  But personal protection does not guarantee that, if there is no  security and order in the country, if every citizen's security  is not guaranteed. We cannot depend on the successes of  individual guards until the state ensures law and order.    [NEATKARIGA CINA] What are you by nature: an optimist or a  pessimist?    [Vectirans] It is a very hard time for Latvia right now. We  are standing at the crossroads--perhaps it is out country's  fate, always to be at the crossroads. But still, I as a  Christian person, also know that we must do everything possible  so that we again have order here. And I also know that IT WILL  BE ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT WAYS, BUT IT WILL BE GOOD. One hundred  percent! I will even swear to it with my signature!

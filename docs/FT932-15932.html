			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Letter: ACT and pensions: short-term gain but long-term loss Sir, I was interested to read Norma Cohen's article on Budget changes to ACT and its effect on pensions ('Worse off at the end of the day', April 5). There are many things about current government policy which are difficult to understand other than on purely hard-nosed money terms (for example, closure of mental hospitals and cuts in legal aid). But even on those terms, considering that in future an increasing percentage of the population will be in the older age brackets, it surely makes good long-term fiscal sense to encourage people to provide for their retirement years. Retirees who have made adequate pension provisions will be less of a drain on public resources in the years to come. From your reports and others I have read, it seems that the government is charting a course of short-term fiscal gain at the expense of long-term policy.

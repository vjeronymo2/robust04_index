			<p>BFN     [Text] Landless farmer groups have invaded public buildings  and created huge confusion in the traffic in four state  capitals. In Pernambuco, they caused a traffic jam and occupied  the INCRA [National Land Reform and Settlement Institute]  headquarters in Recife. The invaders want the government to  accelerate the expropriation of farms in the interior of the  state. The INCRA regional superintendent blamed the delay on  bureaucracy.    In Fortaleza, Ceara State, 400 invaders have been occupying  the Legislative Assembly since last night. Police are  preventing other demonstrators from entering the building. The  demonstrators demand the payment of emergency front salaries  which are due. They have not received their salaries for 45  days. The payment must be made by the federal government.  After meeting Governor Ciro Gomes, the invaders decided to  leave the Legislative Assembly late in the afternoon. The  governor promised to do his best to ensure payment of the  overdue salaries and to convince the government to increase the  emergency front salaries.    In Maceio, Alagoas State, the invaders have been in the  Finance Ministry offices since 9 May. It was decided in a  meeting that on 16 May they will receive seeds and basic  foodstuff baskets, but the invaders decided to remain in the  offices until the seeds and food are delivered.    On the third day of demonstrations in Porto Alegre, the  landless farmers marched along downtown streets and caused huge  traffic jams. They walked up to the government palace and tried  to meet with Governor Alceu Collares. They want land for  settlements, credits for small farmers, and a meeting with the  finance minister. The striking invaders even barred the finance  minister's entrance to the Finance Ministry. Here is Alexandre  Garcia's report:    [Begin Garcia recording] Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero  has  been the victim of two incidents that could have had serious  consequences if it had not been for his common sense.    The first incident occurred during a class he was teaching  at  Brasilia University, where he has been teaching for the last 24  years. Strikers invaded the classroom carrying a coffin and CUT  [Sole Workers Center] flags. The professor suspended the class  and walked toward his car in the parking lot. He was followed  by the strikers, who were threatening the professor and minister.    The second incident occurred after lunch yesterday, when he  was returning to the Finance Ministry and found the entrance  door blocked by members of the Landless Farmers Movement who  were carrying CUT flags. He turned around and went to his  Planalto Palace office.    The finance minister reported on these incidents a few  minutes ago. He said the incidents seemed to have been  coordinated so as to be conducted throughout the country as a  political strike against the economic plan. He pointed out that  even the CUT national treasurer had admitted that. As an  example, he mentioned that the offices of the Finance Ministry  in four capitals have been simultaneously invaded. He added  that these methods are not democratic. [end recording]    We will now report on reactions to the strikes and the  invasion of public buildings nationwide:    [Begin recording] [Deputy Miro Teixeira; Democratic Labor  Party, Rio de Janeiro] I do not believe, for example, that to  maintain a minister inside his ministry's facilities, as if he  were in a private prison, can benefit strikers. These incidents,  however, may have been carried out by an agitator infiltrated  into the movement.    [Deputy Artur da Tavola; Brazilian Social Democracy Party  leader] The PT [Workers Party] radical sector wants to unite the  people around the excuse of the salary demand. The most  reasonable PT sectors are hurriedly trying to extinguish this  fire, but it has already given birth to the dragon that is now  giving orders.    [Deputy Chico Vigilante; PT deputy leader] These strikes  have  no political objective whatsoever. These strikes have economic  reasons: The workers are demanding regaining their salaries'  purchasing power.    [Senator Marco Maciel; Liberal Front Party leader] As the  strikes seek to destabilize the economic plan, they will result  not only in political and electoral harm, but will also harm the  country itself.    [Jair Meneghelli; CUT president] These strikes logically  help, as they enable workers to obtain compensation for losses  resulting from the Fernando Henrique Cardoso plan.    [Enilson Simoes de Moura; Union Force secretary] The recent  strikes have clearly caused large electoral losses. There is a  clear movement aimed at giving social consistency to Lula and PT  criticism of the economic plan currently in force in the  country. [end recording]</p>

			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / International Company News: Sabena to strengthen alliance with Delta Sabena is to strengthen its links with Delta Air Lines of the US, the Belgian state airline said yesterday. The airlines will share the Brussels - New York route from January 16. Passengers booking through Sabena or Delta will travel on one of Sabena's Boeing 747s to and from New York's JFK airport and Delta will supply cabin crew. Sabena, which has been working to cut costs and improve its service, said the arrangement would save it some BFr600m (Dollars 16.5m) a year in operating costs. In March, the two companies announced a similar deal on the Brussels - Atlanta route. Delta's Boeing 767-300s have been carrying Sabena passengers on this route since June 1. Sabena said there was 'always the possibility' that they might co-operate on other routes. The Sabena announcement follows the collapse of talks on an ambitious merger between four European airlines - Swissair, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Scandinavian Airlines System and Austrian Airlines. The four groups announced the end of talks last week after failing to agree on a suitable US partner. Delta, which has cross-equity links with Swissair, was one of the possible partners. Sabena said yesterday that the success or failure of the four-way 'Alcazar' alliance had not been a factor in negotiations with Delta on the Brussels - New York route. European carriers have moved quickly to establish alliances with US counterparts in recent years. Air France, which has a large stake in Sabena, has links with Continental of the US. Sabena said yesterday competition between the two alliances would be slight because Continental does not fly between New York and Brussels. 'This co-operation (with Delta) is proof that Sabena can develop its own strategy with the approval of Air France,' said the Belgian airline.</p>

			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Recovery hopes dented by weak bank lending Exceptionally weak bank lending figures out yesterday underlined the continuing reluctance of consumers and companies to take on new debts. Bank of England data showed that sterling lending to the private sector  - M4 lending - was only Pounds 0.5bn in November compared with the previous month's Pounds 1.8bn. The year-on-year growth rate stayed flat at 3 per cent, just marginally higher than the 30-year low of 2.9 per cent recorded in July. Economists said the figures were not encouraging for recovery prospects. Mr Ian Shepherdson of Midland Global Markets said the sluggishness of lending probably reflected 'massive uncertainty' before last month's Budget. M4 itself - the broad measure of the money supply - rose a seasonally adjusted 0.4 per cent in November compared with October, to stand 4.9 per cent up on a year ago. The Bank said the pick-up in M4 was being driven mainly by government gilts sales rather than by growth in lend-ing to the private sector. Other figures yesterday from the British Bankers' Association showed that lending by the UK's main banking groups was strong in November. The seasonally adjusted statistics showed very strong lending to the financial sector, a steady growth in mortgage lending, but falls in lending to most other categories including manufacturers, wholesalers, property and construction companies. Overall, lending rose by Pounds 2.08bn, slightly higher than October's Pounds 1.94bn increase. The November rise would have been larger had two banks not securitised some of their personal loans. Commenting on the figures, Lord Inchyra, director-general of the BBA, said: 'After making allowance for the two securitisations this month, it would seem that there was some pick-up in consumer borrowing.' Mr John Ecklin, director of statistics at the BBA, said the difference between the association's figures and the M4 lending figure mainly reflected big net repayments of company debt to banks that are not part of the nine main groups.</p>

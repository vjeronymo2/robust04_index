The construction of the first phase of the Haicang port,  involving a total investment of some 406 million yuan, is aimed  at building a container berth of 30,000 dwt and a berth for bulk  cargo with a planned handling capacity of some 500,000 tons  annually.    Another construction project begun in Haicang last Saturday  [26 February] is the first phase of the Xinyang industrial park.    With a total area of some 6.7 sq km, the industrial park  will  attract domestic and overseas businesses involved in such  sectors as computers, plastics, chemicals and machinery  electronics.    Meanwhile, three giant firms, including Xiamen "Huili"  Investment and Development Ltd., the Xiamen "Dazhong" Taxi  Company and "Yongsheng" Container Ltd., a Sino-Hong Kong joint  venture, went into operation last Saturday in this China's  largest Taiwan-funded development zone.    With favorable natural and geographic conditions, the zone,  opened to the outside world in November 1993, is expected to  become the third largest development zone after Pudong area in  Shanghai and Yangpu in south China's Hainan Province.    To date, the zone has invested nearly 800 million yuan to  upgrade its infrastructure and has worked out a series of  preferential polices in a bid to attract more overseas investors.</p>

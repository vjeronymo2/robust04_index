			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE PRACTICAL MIND: TERRY SAVAGE TALKS MONEY BY TERRY SAVAGE (DEARBORN  FINANCIAL PUBLISHING: $22.95)  </P> <P> It's Sunday morning. Do you know where your money is, and what it's doing?  </P> <P> Chances are, you don't.  </P> <P> If you don't have much, the worry is next week's bills.  </P> <P> If you do, you probably turn over some control of your money to experts --  accountants or investment advisers of one sort or another -- who manage it for  you.  </P> <P> In either case, you can benefit from "Terry Savage Talks Money: The  Common-Sense Guide to Money Matters." Savage is a business reporter for a  Chicago TV station, and a registered investment adviser, but she writes in a  language even a civilian can comprehend. Her TV training (make it fast, make it  simple) may have helped her in putting together this book; it's basic stuff,  and it's presented in easily digestible form.  </P> <P> For example, Savage explains not only how to invest in Treasury Bills or notes  but also how the payout of those instruments works. She's as clear on buying a  house or a car, and, for anyone with a dime left over, investing in stocks and  bonds, commodities, precious metals and real estate. Her cautionary attitude on  the last category is in marked contrast, and a welcome antidote, to the  pie-in-the-sky promises made by promoters, both on TV and in print.  </P> <P> What Savage has to say may sound like eat-your-oatmeal to people who tend to  spend today and worry tomorrow. But she's trying to protect your assets -- from  your own carpe diem madness (why buy a T-bill when I can have a new Armani  suit?) as well as from financial "experts" who manage to plunder the funds  funneled through them. What Savage suggests is that we all invest wisely,  whether a little or a lot; money is not some mystical language known only to a  select few.  </P></p>

			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / World Trade News: US foments beer war with Canada THE beer war between the US and Canada intensified yesterday when Washington demanded authorisation from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to retaliate against its northern neighbour for discriminating against imports of US beer. The US said it was seeking to recoup damage to US brewers of about Dollars 80m a year. A US complaint against discriminatory practices by state liquor boards in Canada was upheld by a Gatt disputes panel last September. In April, following earlier threats of retaliation by Washington, the two sides said they had reached agreement on giving US brewers easier access to the Canadian market. At yesterday's meeting of Gatt's governing council, Washington accused Canada of deliberately trying to circumvent the panel's findings. The US is particularly angry about two practices by Ontario - a new beer pricing system operated by the monopoly state liquor board, which includes a handling charge for imported beer, and a rise in the tax on non-refillable containers for alcoholic drinks. Canada yesterday rejected the US demand for trade reprisals as 'completely unwarranted' and said Washington was complaining simply because Canada had not made changes to its liquor regime in a way that satisfied US brewers. Separately, Washington agreed yesterday to a request by the EC for the establishment of a disputes panel on the US trade embargo against some 20 countries which re-export yellow-fin tuna caught by nets which kill dolphins. Earlier the Gatt council approved a six-month extension to end-June 1993 for Mr Arthur Dunkel's term of office as director-general.</p>

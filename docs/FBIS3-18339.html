The entire investment amounts to  1.5 billion schillings, making Austria one of the most important  investors in Poland.    The strongest Austrian commitment has been in the  construction sector. Yet, Austria is also represented in the  trade, consulting, and the banking sectors. "Austrian companies  should invest more in Poland now," trade delegate Rudolf Orisich  recommended at a seminar in Vienna. He emphasized that Poland  could boast the best economic figures in East Europe. GDP has  increased by 4.5 percent, industrial production by 7 percent,  the agricultural sector by 1.5 percent, and private consumption  by 9 percent (estimated figures for 1993). At the moment, some  40 percent of the economy has been privatized, and a third of  industry, 50 percent of foreign trade, and 90 percent of retail  trade has been denationalized.    In 1993, Austrian exports decreased by 8.8 percent to 6.4  billion schillings, while imports fell by 6.6 percent to 4.7  billion schillings. The agreement between Poland and the  European Free Trade Association is intended to stimulate  relations.</p>

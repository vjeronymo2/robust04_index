			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Perpetual improves to Pounds 4.79m PERPETUAL, the unit trust and portfolio management organisation, saw its pre-tax profit expand from Pounds 2.94m to Pounds 4.79m in the year ended September 30 1992. Earnings per share grew from 7.95p to 12.49p and the final dividend is 3.6p to lift the total from 3.2p to 4.8p. The investment performance, in comparative terms, was excellent in the long, medium and short term, said Mr Martyn Arbib, chairman. Over the year funds under management had risen from Pounds 693m to Pounds 846m, and had now further grown to Pounds 1bn following sterling devaluation, stock market improvements, and an influx of new money for investment. The long-term strategy to effect an entry into the pension fund industry continued although there were no significant developments to report. However, there was an encouraging level of interest in the group's unit trusts by institutions and sales volumes had increased substantially.</p>

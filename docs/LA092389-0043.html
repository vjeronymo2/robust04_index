			<p><P> September 23, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PERSISTENCE PAYS OFF FOR CASEY, SYLMAR  </P> <P> Jerome Casey made several nice runs Friday night against Verdugo Hills High.  </P> <P> Some of them even counted.  </P> <P> Casey, billed as one of the nation's 10 best high school running backs by Super  Prep magazine, scored three touchdowns and had two others nullified by  penalties to lead Sylmar to a 28-7 victory over Verdugo Hills in a nonleague  opener at Sylmar.  </P> <P> Surprisingly, Casey finished with more receiving yardage than rushing yardage.  The senior tailback gained 78 yards in 15 carries and scored on a three-yard  touchdown run in the third quarter.  </P> <P> Casey also caught three passes for 97 yards and two touchdowns -- one of 28  yards from Daniel Terry in the second quarter and one of 47 yards from Terry  with 32 seconds to play.  </P> <P> "That's what we want to do, keep defenses honest," Casey said. "As long as I  help my team, that's all that matters."  </P> <P> He helped all right. Casey accounted for 175 of Sylmar's 244 total yards.  </P> <P> He also had touchdown runs of 19 and 16 yards nullified by holding penalties.  </P> <P> Terry completed six of 14 passes for 139 yards and two touchdowns and threw two  interceptions.  </P> <P> The Sylmar defense, led by linebacker London Woodfin, limited Verdugo Hills to  109 yards in offense -- 28 in the second half. The Dons netted just 13 yards  passing, misfiring on nine of 11 passing attempts.  </P> <P> Joe Vaughn and Girmar Johnson each had an interception for Sylmar.  </P> <P> Verdugo Hills played the last 15 minutes without starting quarterback Darryl  Evans, who left the game in the third period because of a leg injury.  </P> <P> Sylmar turned the ball over four times -- twice on fumbles, twice on  interceptions -- and Verdugo Hills had three turnovers.  </P></p>

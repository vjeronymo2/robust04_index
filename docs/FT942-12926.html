			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / International Company News: Publication of Euro Disney audit urged The chairman of the French stock market watchdog yesterday urged Euro Disney's creditors to make public their audit of the troubled leisure group's finances. Mr Jean Saint-Geours, chairman of the Commission des Operations de Bourse (COB), said it was difficult to assess the fairness of the terms of Euro Disney's FFr13bn (Dollars 2bn) emergency financial restructuring without the detailed information contained in the audit, which was commissioned by creditors from KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy group. The COB stressed, however, that Mr Saint-Geours was not making an official request for the audit to be made public. However, it is investigating the dramatic movements in Euro Disney's share price in the approach to the restructuring negotiations, to check whether there were any leaks of information. Euro Disney was one of 85 cases investigated last year by the COB. It handed 35 dossiers over to the French courts for further investigation during the year, against 24 in 1992. One of France's biggest insider trading scandals yesterday opened a new chapter as the appeal began in the Pechiney affair, a case concerning illegal dealing in the shares of the state-controlled aluminium and packaging group on the eve of a large US acquisition.</p>

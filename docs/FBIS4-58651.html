			<p>BFN     [Text] Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin says American  Secretary of State Warren Christopher will return to the region  in the middle of the month, because he is convinced peace can be  achieved between Israel and Syria. Beilin told reporters in Tel  Aviv that Christopher received a detailed Israeli proposal  representing official thinking on the nature of the settlement.  He had received the Syrian reply, which was very different from  Israel's proposal, but was sufficiently detailed to envisage a  common denominator between the two sides, he said. Beilin also  said there was no serious prospect of development between Israel  and Syria without American intervention.    Referring to the agreement with the PLO, Beilin stressed  'Arafat's biggest test would be the manner of the entry of the  Palestinian police and 'Arafat's ability to stand up to the  opposition against him. Israel would not agree to any PLO  agreement with Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] enabling  Hamas to operate outside the autonomy, because it would be a  violation of the agreement.</p>

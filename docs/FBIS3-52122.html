			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mahmud Bakri] </F>   [Text] Well-informed sources have told AL-SHA'B that the  Israeli intelligence service (Mosad) is probably behind the  abduction of Libyan oppositionist Mansur al-Kikhya. The sources  say that it is part of a scheme to undermine Egyptian-Libyan  relations by blaming the operation on Libya and paving the way  for a military strike against the Libyan Jamahiriyah.    The circles noted that an eight-member team from the U.S.  intelligence service (CIA) will arrive in Cairo within a few  days to investigate the disappearance of al-Kikhya. This is  part of the U.S. Administration's plan to highlight the issue to  adopt a military plan to strike at Colonel Mu'ammar  al-Qadhdhafi's regime under the pretext of his violations of  human rights.    U.S. President Bill Clinton had instructed the U.S.  intelligence service to adopt a speedy plan to identify the  location of al-Kikhya and investigate claims that Libyan  elements kidnapped him in collaboration with Egyptian security  elements. He asked President Mubarak to intervene to clear up  the mystery of al-Kikhya's disappearance. The visit to Libya of  Dr. Usamah al-Baz, first Foreign Ministry under secretary and  director of the President's Office for Political Affairs, came  within this context.    In the past few days Cairo has received several U.S. reports  accusing Libya of being involved in al-Kikhya's disappearance.  The U.S. reports accused Libyan diplomats in Cairo of planning  the operation and called on the Egyptian Government to downgrade  its relations with Libya as a quick reaction to the operation.  However, Egypt told Washington that it would not adopt any  measures against Libya before the accusation is confirmed.</p>

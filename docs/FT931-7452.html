			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Sharp fall to Pounds 58m at Sedgwick RECESSION AND low insurance rates in the United States led to a sharp fall in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 82.4m to Pounds 58.2m, at Sedgwick Group, one of the UK's biggest insurance brokers. Business was also adversely affected by a shrinkage in the London insurance market, a decline in interest rates worldwide and a sharp rise in underwriting losses at River Thames Insurance, the insurance company in which Sedgwick has a 49 per cent share. A final dividend of 3p is proposed, cutting the total for the year from 12p to 6p. Earnings were Pounds 35.5m and earnings per share 8.3p, compared with Pounds 54.6m and 12.8p in 1991 respectively. Mr Sax Riley, chief executive, said the group was focusing on 'increasing revenue' in 1993, but warned that 'no significant improvement' was expected. Executives were downbeat about prospects for US insurance rates, where despite recent losses, rates remain competitive. Some 40 per cent of Sedgwick's revenues are generated by its US operations. 'We have seen some tightening in the reinsurance market,' said Mr Quill Healey, head of Sedgwick's US operation, 'but not much of it has fed through on a day-to-day basis. We are seeing some change in Florida but in general it just hasn't happened yet.' Brokerage and fee income rose by Pounds 10m to Pounds 631.9m, but interest and investment income fell to Pounds 53m (Pounds 63.2m). Expenses rose 2 per cent to Pounds 608.8m. Operating profit dropped to Pounds 76.1m (Pounds 92.7m). Associates' losses amounted to Pounds 3.1m (profit Pounds 1.4m). Insurance underwriting profits amounted to Pounds 900,000 (Pounds 1.5m). Interest payable rose to Pounds 15.7m (Pounds 13.2m), reflecting an increase in borrowings from Pounds 96m to Pounds 156m during the year. Profitability of the EW Payne reinsurance subsidiary fell by approximately Pounds 4m, a decline of 25 per cent compared with 1991. Brokerage declined by Pounds 5m to Pounds 63.1m, reflecting the sharp contraction in capacity. See Lex</p>

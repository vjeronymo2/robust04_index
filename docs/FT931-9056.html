			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / International Capital Markets: Bank of England faces pressure for auction timetable THE BANK of England continues to face pressure to set an official calendar for its auctions of UK government bonds, as investors press for a predictable timetable similar to those in the US and France, according to the Bank of England's Quarterly Bulletin*. The Bank says that its survey of around 70 investing institutions, both domestic and overseas, indicated that while most are satisfied with the way in which the gilt market operates, some were keen that 'the authorities should move from the current discretionary auction timetable to a pre-announced auction calendar'. However, the Bank argues there is an 'advantage to both the authorities and the market as a whole in retaining an element of flexibility in the execution of the funding programme, particularly with regard to tap sales as a supplement to the auction programme'. It says the current arrangement allows it to respond to market conditions. For example, immediately after the Conservative victory in the April general election, demand for gilts was very strong and the Bank sold an estimated Pounds 3bn-Pounds 5bn of stock through the night and the following day. The bulletin points to 'an encouraging degree of satisfaction among the investor community with the gilt market-making service provided by the GEMMs (gilt-edged market-makers)', and says that the approach to funding received broad support from investors. The Bank held five gilt auctions in 1992 for a combined amount of Pounds 12bn (nominal), representing just under 40 per cent of the total stock issued. The total nominal value of gilt-edged stock outstanding rose from Pounds 122.4bn at the end of 1991 to Pounds 144.1bn at the end of 1992. This exceeds the previous peak of Pounds 141bn in March 1988. The Bank noted an increase in the market's holdings of long-dated conventional gilts - from 8.2 per cent to 13.7 per cent of total holdings - which was offset by falls in short- and medium-dated issues. 'The decision to concentrate new issues in longer-dated maturities was influenced by good demand for such stocks from domestic institutional investors, which were the major buyers of gilts in the course of 1992 as they sought to increase their holdings of gilts and to lengthen their portfolios,' the Bank says. Investors sought to maximise capital gains as interest rates fell by buying long-dated issues. *The gilt-edged market: developments in 1992 - from the Bank of England's Quarterly Bulletin.

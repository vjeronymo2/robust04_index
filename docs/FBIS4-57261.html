			<p>BFN     [Text] Army Commander General Lino Oviedo said yesterday  that the military forces who left their barracks to overthrow  the Stroessnerist dictatorship will continue defending democracy  "to the last day of our lives, whether from the inside or  outside of the Armed Forces." Oviedo said the military will  perform social works in the interior "without their weapons" if  these works are ordered by the commander in chief. He made it  clear that he will retire from the military if he is ordered to  use his weapons against peasants. Oviedo also denied charges  made by opposition politicians who accused him of being one of  the main elements destabilizing President Juan Carlos Wasmosy's  government.    The Army commander said that the defense of the democratic  system installed in the country following the coup that deposed  Stroessner was a matter of consistency. "At least those of us  who left the barracks on the night of 2 and 3 February must be  consistent. We are going to be consistent to the last days of  our lives, whether from the inside or outside of the Armed  Forces," Oviedo said, repeating Wasmosy's words that the  military and the people will defend democracy in our country.    Asked if he was aware of the existence of groups of people  who are attempting to destabilize President Wasmosy's  government, Oviedo answered: "The best informed person in the  country is our commander in chief. He gives us the information  we know. If he says so, it must be so," Oviedo said.    The Army commander said the violence that affected our  country lately "will end." He made clear, however, that the  Armed Forces will always act according to the Constitution, our  laws, and military regulations.    "We will follow our commander in chief's orders. We will  follow his instructions and what is established in the  Constitution," Oviedo added.    He also promised to defend this and other government in the  future "with everything in his hands." He reiterated that at  this time he does not have a possible presidential candidacy in  mind.    Oviedo also said if the commander in chief decides that the  military must cooperate in social works in the interior of the  country, the military will follow orders. "We will be very glad  to work with our soldiers in the interior," Oviedo said.    The commander warned, however, that he will not have "the  courage" to use his weapons against peasants even if the  commander in chief orders him to do so. "I would retire from the  Army if this were the case," he said.    Yesterday morning Wasmosy and Oviedo presided over the  traditional military parade in front of government palace to  commemorate the 183rd anniversary of our independence. Army,  Navy, and Air Force units participated in the parade.  Detachments of the National Police also paraded in front of the  official stage.    Brazilian and Argentine naval forces participated in the  military parade, receiving long applause from the public  watching the ceremony.    Later the president received a delegation of indigenous  people. Indian leaders complained about their urgent need for  land, food, health, and education</p>

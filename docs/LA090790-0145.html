			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> PREP COACHES ARE LOOKING FOR A FEW GOOD MEN  </P> <P> Morningside High football Coach Ron Tatum constantly struggles to find players  for his team. It's not that Morningside lacks good athletes. The problem is  finding more than a few students willing to put in the time and energy to  become top-flight players.  </P> <P> "Football is one of the oldest traditional activities, but it is not socially  accepted anymore to do the things needed to succeed in football," Tatum said.  "The things that football demands, society doesn't demand anymore. That's why  the number (of players coming out to play) has dwindled. Discipline is not as  important as it used to be."  </P> <P> What Tatum and other high school coaches look for is a student with the  discipline to endure the long, hot practices of summer, work out during the  off-season and stay academically eligible.  </P> <P> "It is difficult to get kids to come out," Tatum said. "We get some, but after  they run a few times, get up early a few times and get hit, they disappear."  </P> <P> Commitment, dedication and drive: Coaches work as hard to find high school  students with these qualities as they do to design game plans.  </P> <P> However, the problem might not be the shrinking number of potential prep stars  with commitment. To play high school football and succeed in the classroom,  16-, 17- and 18-year-olds need organizational skills, attitudes and  sophistication that some adults couldn't muster.  </P> <P> Being a high school football player has become a tough, year-round job.  </P> <P> The required commitment began to increase when the National Collegiate Athletic  Assn. introduced Proposition 48 and raised academic requirements for athletes  entering college.  </P> <P> The high schools followed the NCAA's lead and began demanding respectable  showings from athletes in the classroom. Before that time, school was seen as  an obstacle standing between the athlete and the football field. Today, coaches  view grades as part of an athlete's contribution to the team. Doing well in  class is as vital as coming to practice every day.  </P> <P> Football players must also lift weights in the off-season, participate in  summer passing leagues and, unless they are playing another sport, be available  for workouts and meetings during the day.  </P> <P> The season ends with the last game in the fall, but the athlete's obligations  remain the same in March as in September.  </P> <P> "Back in the '50s and '60s, coaches were trying to get dedication from their  players, but they really didn't have to try that hard to get it," Carson Coach  Gene Vollnogle said. "Then it became a year-round thing, with the  weight-lifting and the passing leagues, and it took dedication to do this."  </P> <P> Yet football wasn't easy on a teen-ager even when it was played just in the  fall. During the season, a player's typical day includes a team meeting,  practice, taping, and getting in and out of uniform.  </P> <P> At Carson, for example, players meet during lunch and practice after school for  two hours. The practices, which Vollnogle describes as "exhausting but  necessary," are highly concentrated and strenuous.  </P> <P> Still, Carson linebacker and team captain Edgar Ta'ase enjoys keeping busy with  football. When not involved with the team, he might be taking care of his  duties as student body president or studying to maintain his 3.5 grade-point  average.  </P> <P> Ta'ase must work hard, but he says he enjoys trying to maintain excellence in  his many activities.  </P> <P> "I don't feel any disadvantage (in the classroom)," he said. "I enjoy football  and I don't see it as a chore. I'd rather be going to meetings, doing  constructive things all the time, instead of sitting around. You have to be  willing to give up the time if you are going to get what you want."  </P> <P> But if you add football duties to the usual commitments of a high school  student, such as classes, dinner and homework, there is little time for  anything else.  </P> <P> Many forces tend to pull students off the football field, ranging from extra  time for school work to pressure from friends and family obligations.  </P> <P> "For a kid to be successful, kids need to have vigilance," Tatum said. "There  are so many things that deter kids today."  </P> <P> At Bishop Montgomery, tight end-linebacker Mike Hall plays football and  baseball, carries a 3.7 GPA and serves on the student council. Maintaining his  hectic schedule takes time away from other activities, but Hall has seen the  rewards of keeping organized: He has received recruiting letters from schools  such as Stanford, USC, Notre Dame, Washington and Colorado.  </P> <P> "You have to keep you priorities straight," Hall said. "You do make sacrifices.  You can't mess around with your teammates after practice; you have to go home  and work. It does put a dent in your social life."  </P> <P> Coaches say a player's first responsibilities are to school and family, but  being a football player takes up most of the rest of a student's time. There is  no limit to his need to build muscles or refine his football skills.  </P> <P> Rolling Hills Coach Gary Kimbrell said: "On the Peninsula, the kids are very  goal-oriented. In an affluent area like this, with smart kids, I wonder why  they put up with it. But they do. The kids usually know how to budget their  time. Some actually perform better in the classroom knowing that each minute  has to be accounted for."  </P> <P> Morningside linebacker Danny Katoa added: "You have to concentrate on  everything you do. I feel a little stress, but my coaches and my family keep me  going. I have learned that I have to be mature and I have to take charge. You  learn to make sacrifices."  </P> <P> The players are not the only ones forced to adjust. Coaches who modeled  themselves after drill sergeants are disappearing or toning down their  hard-line ways in response to the declining number of students willing to put  up with such methods.  </P> <P> Football hasn't all changed. Hell weeks are still hell weeks, and the grueling  workouts still break the strongest of teen-agers, but coaches now try to better  understand the pressures under which their players operate. For example, the  growing importance of academics has forced coaches to provide more time and  encouragement for players to study.  </P> <P> Coaches also show more restraint in criticizing players.  </P> <P> "We have gotten away from the style when a coach was a tyrant, a Vince Lombardi  type," Bishop Montgomery Coach Steve Carroll said. "Coaches are now using  positive reinforcement to get through to players."  </P> <P> Morningside's Katoa added: "Some guys playing don't have the talent. Coaches  know (it does no good) to yell at them. They have to explain, point out the  good things. If they can't, that player will never understand what he did  wrong."  </P> <P> Some coaches even worry that the year-round demands of high school football  today may be too great for teen-agers.  </P> <P> "There is more to life than just football," said Bill Seixas, who coached at  San Pedro High from 1957 through 1965. "Kids should be able to enjoy other  sports. Football has become overemphasized. The commitment for the athlete  should be (only) for the fall season. Then he should be able to develop other  things, like a social life and an interest in other sports."  </P> <P> Current football coaches are quick to note that all their players are free to  play other sports and should put in only the time they have available after  fulfilling other obligations.  </P> <P> Katoa is a standout wrestler at Morningside and Hall plays baseball at Bishop  Montgomery. Neither athlete said he felt pressure to participate in football  when he had other commitments.  </P> <P> "There are times when I've been in a bind between football and baseball, but  the coaches try to help you," Hall said. "Coach Carroll really stresses grades.  It's not like I'm on my own at school. It's definitely a strain if you play two  or three sports, but the coaches understand."  </P> <P> Besides realizing the importance of academics, coaches also seem to be learning  players' limits. Coaches still devise ways to build a better football player,  but their emphasis on high grade-point averages almost rivals the drive for  bigger biceps.  </P></p>

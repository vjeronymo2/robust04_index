			<p><P> September 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOVERNOR URGED TO ASSUME PROP. 103 RESPONSIBILITY  </P> <P> The director of California Common Cause, in a lengthy letter to Gov. George  Deukmejian on Friday, asked the governor to assume personal responsibility for  the implementation of Proposition 103.  </P> <P> Writing that Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie and her department are  "clearly floundering" and have lost the confidence of the public, Common Cause  official Walter Zelman urged the governor to restore public confidence in the  state's effort to implement the landmark insurance initiative.  </P> <P> A spokesman for Deukmejian said the governor was traveling and there would be  no immediate comment. A political consultant recently hired by Gillespie, Stu  Mollrich, noted that Zelman, a Democrat, has been mentioned as considering  running for insurance commissioner next year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Full-Blown Crisis'  </P> <P> In his letter, Zelman said, "The Proposition 103 implementation problem is  becoming a full-blown crisis in government administration.  </P> <P> "The crisis we perceive is not one of personnel or even insurance," he wrote.  "It is a crisis of public confidence in the capacity of California government  to execute state law. We fear that the governmental process is becoming an  object of public anger, scorn and ridicule.  </P> <P> "Our government, and specifically the Department of Insurance, appears adrift  and unable to cope with its new administrative burden or with the political  controversy that is part of the 103 implementation process."  </P> <P> Zelman said the public has come to believe that Gillespie and her department  have been "either biased, ineffective, indecisive or without direction."  </P> <P> He accused Gillespie of allowing months to pass without preparing  implementation procedures, resisting certain parts of Proposition 103 while  advocating alternative insurance reform solutions such as no-fault, failing to  organize well-defined hearings and data collection processes and exempting many  insurers from rate rollbacks without fully disclosing why.  </P> <P> Under the circumstances, Zelman told Deukmejian, "The direct involvement of  your office is now mandatory."  </P> <P> He asked the governor to convene a high-level representative task force of all  major groups to reach reasonable compromises on implementation procedures,  insist that Gillespie hold hearings on major issues such as what rate of return  the insurance companies should be allowed, agree to finance consumer  representation in the upcoming proceedings and make it clear that the full  authority of the governor's office is behind implementation.  </P> <P> Barring this, there will be "more public frustration and anger and a further  decline in public confidence in governmental institutions," Zelman said.  </P> <P> Gillespie consultant Mollrich responded later that "Zelman may as well ask the  governor to take over the Legislature. They're not doing the job either."  </P> <P> Mollrich, coordinator of the oust-Rose Bird campaign three years ago and the  campaign for the property-tax cutting Proposition 13 a decade ago, was recently  retained by Gillespie to assess her chances of keeping her post when it becomes  an elective office next year.  </P> <P> He said Friday he has just begun his assessment and cannot say when it will be  completed. But he disagreed with those who have been saying that Gillespie  ruined her chances when she decided that hundreds of insurance companies should  be exempted from the Proposition 103 rollbacks.  </P> <P> "There's no perception of Gillespie that has really impacted the public at  all," Mollrich said in an interview. "There have been a few stories over a  one-week period about her exemption decisions, but they won't have a  tremendously long impact.  </P></p>

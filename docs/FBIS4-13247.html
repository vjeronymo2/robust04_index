			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Nabih Birri, speaker of the Lebanese Chamber of  Deputies, began an official visit to Jordan at the head of a  Lebanese parliamentary delegation. His visit is aimed at  discussing bilateral relations and the current Arab situation.  Details are in the following report by our parliamentary  affairs correspondent:    A session of Jordanian-Lebanese parliamentary talks was held  at the Parliament today. The Jordanian side was led by Tahir  al-Masri, speaker of the House of Representatives, and included  members of the permanent office, heads of committees, and  rapporteurs of the parliamentary blocs. The Lebanese side was  led by Nabih Birri, speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, and  included a number of deputies as well as representatives of  leading Lebanese newspapers.    Tahir al-Masri said: We welcome Mr. Birri as a prominent  national and pan-Arab figure who is playing a distinguished role  in restoring Arab solidarity. Al-Masri said that we, in Jordan  and Lebanon, are convinced that our democratic march and respect  of citizens' rights constitute the basic cornerstone in the  battle of restoring Arab rights.    He added that we, in Jordan, have Arab rather than Jordanian  concerns. Jordan is unionist and Arabist. It has paid a dear  price as a result of its pan-Arab stands and democratic march.    Nabih Birri, speaker of the Lebanese Chamber of Deputies,  thanked the king and people of Jordan for not acting  unilaterally and for paying the tax of war.    He said that we should return to our Arab solidarity, adding  that the Arab cordon states --Syria. Lebanon, Jordan, and  Palestine -- must be supported so that none of them are singled  out.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Brother President 'Arafat, president of the state of  Palestine and chairman of the PLO Executive Committee, received  a reply message from his brother Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz Al  Sa'ud, king of the fraternal Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and  custodian of the two holy mosques.    The message stated: We stress that the Kingdom of Saudi  Arabia, stemming from its firm stands and its everlasting  fraternal links with the brotherly Palestinian people, will--God  willing--remain as ever supportive of the legitimate cause to  accomplish the security and just peace that will guarantee its  legitimate rights and realize its benevolent objectives in the  return to its homeland and the establishment of its independent  state with holy Jerusalem as its capital.</p>

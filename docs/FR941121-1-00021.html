			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4. The Federal Processor Permit Application (Form FPP&hyph;1) is revised to reflect changes referenced in items 2. and 3., above; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The definition of ``round weight or round-weight equivalent'' is revised to reflect the recent amendment of the definition of this term in 50 CFR 672.2 and 675.2 (59 FR 50699, October 5, 1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A further description of and justification for the proposed regulatory amendments listed under the first three items follow.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 1995 Observer Coverage Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Prior to the effective date of the Research Plan, Amendments 13 and 18 to the FMPs for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska and Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area respectively, authorized the Observer Plan, which set out domestic observer coverage requirements for groundfish vessels and processors. The Observer Plan stated `` *&blank;*&blank;*&blank;operators of catcher vessels which transport unsorted codends to a mothership are not required to comply with this Observer Plan.'' On April 29, 1994, a final rule was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to revise observer coverage requirements that inadvertently deleted this exemption for catcher vessels 125 ft (38.1 m) length overall (LOA) or longer (59 FR 22133). This erroneous regulatory language was incorporated into the final rule implementing 1995 observer coverage requirements under the Research Plan (&sect;677.10(a)(1)(i)(C)). The result is that current regulations under the Research Plan require catcher vessels 125 ft (38.1 m) LOA or longer to carry an observer at all times, even when the vessel is delivering unsorted codends to a processor and no opportunity exists for the observer to observe the catch.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed rule would revise regulations at &sect;677.10(a)(1)(i)(C) to correct this error by requiring a catcher vessel 125 ft (38.1 m) LOA or longer to carry an observer 100 percent of its fishing days. The term ``fishing days'' currently is defined at &sect;677.2 to exclude days during which a vessel only delivers unsorted codends to a processor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Definition of the Term ``Processor''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The definition of the term ``processor,'' as published in the September 6, 1994, final rule implementing the Research Plan, includes any person, except a restaurant, who receives fish from fishermen for commercial purposes. The final rule implementing the Research Plan added the exclusion for restaurants, but indicated the intent was that all landings of fish harvested in Research Plan fisheries be accounted for so that fees may be assessed based on the amount of fish landed and an annually specified fee per pound.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the definition published in the September 6, 1994, final rule, a tender vessel receiving fish from fishermen for delivery to a shoreside processing facility could be considered a processor. Inclusion of tender vessels as processors for purposes of the Research Plan was not the intent of the final rule implementing the Research Plan and is unnecessary to account for landings of fish. Accordingly, NMFS proposes to revise the definition of ``processor'' so that it is clear that tender vessels are not included.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The definition of processor in the September 6, 1994, final rule also inadvertently excluded fishermen who transport fish to persons outside the United States. To date, the amount of fish transferred by fishermen to persons outside the United States is believed to be small. However, the halibut and sablefish Individual Fishing Quota (IFQ) program scheduled for implementation in 1995 (58 FR 59375, November 9, 1993) is anticipated to result in increased deliveries of these species to persons in Canada and elsewhere outside the United States. Such deliveries could result in unreported landings. Consequently, NMFS proposes to revise the definition of ``processor'' to clarify that these fishermen are considered processors so that they are held accountable for payment of billed fee assessments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Exemption of Certain Processors From Applying for a Processor Permit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The final rule implementing the Research Plan requires that all processors of fish from Research Plan fisheries must have a Federal Processor Permit. This requirement is reasonable for those processors that anticipate participation in a Research Plan fishery, but is not necessary for a fisherman who delivers fish outside of the United States or sells fish directly to restaurants or to individuals for use as bait or personal consumption. Furthermore, the fisherman may not be the owner of the catcher vessel. Vessel owners often cannot anticipate the number or identity of operators of their vessels during a given fishing year. As a result, individual fishermen who are processors under the Research Plan may be difficult to identify until after an Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&amp;G) fish ticket or other documentation of landing has been submitted. Therefore, this proposed rule would make it explicit that these processors are exempt from such requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NMFS further notes its intent that the following sections of the Observer Plan still are effective during the first year of the Research Plan (1995): (1) Standards of observer conduct (attachment number 3); and (2) the description, specifications, and work statement for certified domestic observer contractors, including conflict of interest standards for NMFS-certified observers and contractors and conditions for contractor and observer certification revocation (attachment number 4). Copies of the Observer Plan dated May 1994 are available from NMFS (see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After the first year of the Research Plan, standards and criteria for conduct, certification, conflict of interest, and revocation of certification of observers and observer contractors will be included as part of the contractual arrangements between NMFS and observer contractors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

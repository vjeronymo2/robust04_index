He  expressed condolences in connection with the tragic death of  scores of totally innocent people in Hebron (al-Khalil), which  has aroused the indignation of Palestinians, Arabs, and the  entire Muslim world. We resolutely condemn this crime, the  minister said.    Andrey Kozyrev expressed the hope that neither the  Palestinians nor the Israelis would give in to the provocations  of extremists and that the vigorous search for an all-embracing  peace in the Near East would be continued.    In this connection Yasir 'Arafat stressed that he was  interested in Russia's vigorous efforts. He requested the UN  Security Council to support the Palestinian proposals.    Andrey Kozyrev replied that Russian representatives at the  UN  would urgently be given instructions on this score. They agreed  to maintain day-to-day contact on these issues both by telephone  and via diplomatic channels.</p>

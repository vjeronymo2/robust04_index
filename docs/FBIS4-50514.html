			<p>BFN     [Text] In line with their different conditions, Hailun  city has adopted various forms to sell its 13 state-owned  enterprises in order to enable them to regain their vitality.    The enterprises on sale have long suffered losses and have  been on the verge of bankruptcy. The accumulated volume of  losses amounted to more than 2 million yuan. The city  previously adopted the contracting and leasing systems to save  these enterprises. However, these systems have proved to be only  slightly effective. In response, since 1993 the city has sent  its work teams to carry out investigations to learn about their  situation. These teams have also estimated their assets and had  them form a list according to their different situation so that  these enterprises can be sold all at once, sold by issuing  shares, and sold by transferring the repayment of bank loans and  debts.    The city has sold all at once through public bidding the  rubber plant, the fertilizer plant, and the daily chemical  necessities plant because their management has been relatively  poor and their losses have been serious. After the sale, these  state-owned plants have become privately run enterprises.    As for the vibration prescription equipment plant, whose  equipment runs well, the department in charge of the sale has  fixed its sale price at 1.1 million yuan and sold it by issuing  shares to the 132 staff members and workers of the plant.    As for the shoe general plant, the knitwear general factory,  and the No.3 foodstuffs plant, whose debits and bank loans have  been relatively large, the city has rented them out by  transferring the repayment of their bank loans and debts. This  means these plants can be leased in line with the negotiated  prices without paying the entire sum for the deal, but have the  renters be responsible for repaying the bank loans and debts.  The property rights of these plants is owned by the staff  members and workers.    After the sale, all legal persons in these enterprises said:  More persons have assumed responsibility in the enterprise at  present, more personnel have taken charge of management, and  more persons have a sense of crisis. Since the beginning of  this year, the fertilizer plant has turned out more than 3,000  tonnes of compound fertilizer of various categories, showing a  50 percent increase over the same period of 1993. The mining  parts plant has turned out more than 460 tonnes of steel ingots  and shape steel products, topping the previous peak scored in  the same period. The vibration prescription equipment plant has  succeeded in increasing the variety of three new products within  a short period of several months. Each share owned by the staff  members and workers of the plant is expected to increase its  value by 20 percent. The wages of staff members and workers in  the fertilizer plant has shown a 100 percent increase over that  before the sale.</p>

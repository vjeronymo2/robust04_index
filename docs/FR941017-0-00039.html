OSM shall require in connection with any project for the control or extinguishment of fires in any inactive coal mine on lands not owned or controlled by the United States or any of its agencies, except where such project is necessary for the protection of lands or other property owned or controlled by the United States or any of its agencies in such a State that: (1) the State or the person owning or controlling such lands contribute on a matching basis 50 percent of the cost of planning and executing such project, or (2) if such State or person furnishes evidence satisfactory to the Secretary of an inability to make the immediately matching contribution herein provided for, that such State or person pay the Government, within such time as the Secretary shall determine, an amount equal to 50 percent of the cost of planning and executing such project. If the project is funded by the Appalachian Regional Commission, the Federal share shall not exceed 75 percent of the cost of the project. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) OSM is authorized to conduct fire control projects on lands owned or controlled by the United States.

There are no cost sharing requirements for this type of project. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8.

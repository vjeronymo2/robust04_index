			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / International Company News: Svenska Handelsbanken tumbles 39% SVENSKA Handelsbanken, one of Sweden's leading commercial banks, suffered a 39 per cent drop in profits to SKr2.77bn (Dollars 470m) for 1991, the bank announced yesterday. The main cause for the setback has been the increase in credit losses which climbed to SKr3.188bn, or 1.1 per cent of loan volume, from SKr623m, or 0.3 per cent, in 1990. The bank said that SKr455m of the losses stemmed from loans to the finance company Gamlestaden. Mr Arne Mortensson, chief executive, said he expected credit losses to be lower this year but he would not make a profit forecast for 1992. The bank said that before taking account of credit losses there was a 15 per cent improvement in profits to SKr5.96bn. Total income was SKr11.5bn, a record figure which after interest was 30 per cent better than in 1990. Despite reduced earnings, Handelsbanken is lifting its dividend to SKr4.75 per share from SKr4.50 in 1990. Return on capital after deductions declined to 11.3 per cent from 22.2 per cent, but the bank pointed out that this was above the average for the Swedish banks. It added that the profit per share (after extraordinary items) fell to SKr8.90 from SKr19.22 in the previous year. Postipankki, Finland's post office bank, suffered a loss of FM135m (Dollars 30.5m) last year compared with a FM35m profit in 1990. The main cause of the deficit was the FM675m of credit losses, which amounted to 0.72 per cent of the bank's loan volume. However, the bank's debt-equity ratio of 10.6 per cent was better than a year earlier. The bank said Finland's deep recession would cast a shadow over its activities during this year. Although there were signs of an improvement, credit losses would continue to be exceptionally high in 1992, it added.</p>

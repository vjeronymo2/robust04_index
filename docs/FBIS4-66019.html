			<p>CSO     [Excerpt] Istanbul News Service--Businessman Vehbi Koc,  citing the foreign and domestic dangers facing Turkey today,  said, "Our country is today entering a heretofore unprecedented  economic crisis." Discounting the need to ascribe blame for the  present difficulty to any particular group or groups, Koc  stressed that the effects of the "economic measures plan"  recently announced by the Tansu Ciller government should be  realized by the middle of 1996. Koc said, "If everyone carries  his share of the burden in a spirit of unity and solidarity, I  am confident that the Turkish nation will overcome this problem."    Koc, in a written three-page statement, issued a call for  unity and solidarity to enable Turkey to overcome the economic  and political crisis it finds itself in today. The 70-year-old  Koc pointed out that he has experienced everything from the  National Salvation Struggle under Ataturk's leadership to the  Inonu, Bayar, and Menderes eras that culminated in single party  regimes with military and coalition governments. Koc cited these  as examples of hard times that Turkey had to endure. Pointing  out that Turkey is entering another period of hard times, Koc  said, "There is widespread devastation from the terrorism in the  southeast. There are economic problems waiting to be solved. Our  country is facing foreign and domestic dangers. We have been in  economic and political turmoil for the past 10 years, but on  similar occasions in the past we have surmounted the  difficulties. This time, however, we have entered a heretofore  unprecedented economic crisis."    Koc continued his statement by saying, "In order to resolve  this situation, the Ciller government announced on 5 April that  it had prepared an `economic measures plan.' This is a good  plan, but the results will be realized gradually over a two-year  period, provided that the plan can be put into effect  immediately. Public opinion has not yet reached a consensus on  how we should overcome the present crisis. There is no point in  assigning blame for this crisis. The Ciller plan may have some  shortcomings--the details have to be worked out--but our  president, prime minister, party leaders, and assembly members  must support and adopt it. The press and television must also  contribute to this effort by pointing the public in the right  direction. It would also be beneficial, after soliciting the  views of the labor unions, the Turkish Union of Chambers and  Commodity Exchanges [TOBB], and the Turkish Industrialists and  Businessmen's Association [TUSIAD] to make the requisite foreign  contacts in order to regain our country's prestige abroad. For  example, what steps will be taken with regard to tax reform,  budget reductions, state enterprise [KIT] privatization and/or  closure, and minimization of the state's share of the economy?  These questions require input and support from the party  leaders. There is no possibility of success if the whole country  is going to be taxed while the government continues to waste  money on unprofitable state enterprises. If taxes are used to  make up the deficits of these state enterprises, you can forget  any possibility of success. If the plan is to be successful, the  burdens must be borne and shared equally. There must be no  turning back after implementation begins. If the implementation  is equitable and all sectors are consulted, and if everyone pays  his taxes, I am convinced that free market forces will ensure  the success of the plan and no further sacrifices will be  necessary. The Turkish nation is a great nation. Any sacrifice  is justified if you believe it is for the good of the nation. If  each one of us does his duty in a spirit of unity and  solidarity, the Turkish nation will overcome the present  difficulty."</p>

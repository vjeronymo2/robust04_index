			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Technology: Public peep at politics Most technological achievements take years - if not centuries - to become the subject of academic research. But a service to be launched to a wider audience next Monday has already become part of a course at the University of Central England in Birmingham. Students studying the official and legal information course are looking at the workings of Polis, a parliamentary online information system which will be available internationally as Justis Parliament next week. Justis Parliament, from Context, the information service company based in London, will enable businesses, government departments, lobbying groups, the media and academics to obtain information about what will happen in both Houses of Parliament - standing committees, tabled questions, early day motions and so on. 'Hansard is only a report of what has happened. Justis looks ahead,' explains Michelle Green, marketing director of Context. Whereas Polis is an online database service, available largely to members of parliament, Justis Parliament combines CD-Rom technology with an online service. This makes it considerably less expensive for the user. A complete record of parliamentary events from 1979 to 1987 is stored on a single disc which costs Pounds 250; a second Pounds 250 disc buys records from 1987 to 1992. For the current parliamentary term from 1992, subscribers buy a combination of CD-Rom and online services. An annual subscription of Pounds 480 buys two discs plus the first 60 minutes of database search time. Because the archival data is stored on CD-Rom, the time it takes to search the database is reduced, Green points out, resulting in lower costs. The service is available over the public packet switched phone network and will be available on the Internet network later this year.</p>

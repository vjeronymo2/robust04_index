			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Top Conservatives question future of unified Budget WHITEHALL officials and senior Conservatives have put a serious question mark over the long-term future of the Treasury's new 'unified' Budget. A month before Mr Kenneth Clarke unveils the first joint tax and spending package on November 30, some ministers believe the new system - combining the old spring Budget and autumn public spending statement - cannot last. The change is being condemned in Whitehall as a clever administrative reform which risks going horribly wrong. It is viewed within Conservative Central Office as a grievous political error. One senior Conservative commented bluntly: 'The change could cost us the next general election.' The party had won the last three elections by going to the country within weeks of announcing income tax cuts in March. No one had considered that it would make no sense to call an election in January. The initial enthusiasm of some in the cabinet for the move has been damped down by the Treasury's refusal to discuss tax changes during the current spending negotiations. Ministers are now describing the phrase 'unified Budget' as a misnomer. Party managers have also realised that switching the Budget to November may make it more difficult to manage the government's small and fractious majority at Westminster. In the past, the finance bill has been debated after the start of the financial year in April. The fact that Budget tax changes were already in place discouraged backbench rebellions. But now a five-month gap between announcements in November and implementation the following April will give potential Conservative rebels ample time to marshall their forces, particularly if the outlook for the economy changes during that period. Mr Clarke might partially circumvent the threat by giving immediate effect on November 30 to any increases in excise duties and value added tax. But he cannot bring forward changes in corporation and income tax. In Whitehall the new system is being attacked on both economic and political grounds. Officials fear that the requirement to take critical decisions nearly six months before the start of the financial year could lead to fatal misjudgments over taxation and borrowing. That problem is particularly acute this year because of the uncertainty over the pace of economic recovery and the size of the borrowing requirement. The chancellor will be basing his decisions on a forecast of public borrowing for next year which contains a huge margin of error. The consensus among Whitehall's mandarins is that Mr Clarke should announce a significant increase in taxes because the economic recovery is well founded and public borrowing remains much too high. But they acknowledge that since the evidence of recovery will remain patchy until next year the political pressures are in the opposite direction.</p>

			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RAMS DIG DEEP FOR DEFENSIVE LINE HELP;  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL: BRIAN SMITH, A ROOKIE LINEBACKER WHO WAS ON THE INJURED RESERVE  LIST FOR SEASONING, WILL START AT RIGHT END AGAINST THE JETS SUNDAY.  </P> <P> The Rams are so desperate on the defensive line, they're not above reaching  into cold storage for help.  </P> <P> Brian Smith, the team's second-round choice from Auburn, was a nice little  project on the back-burner, a lanky linebacker with a considerable future and  wing span. The Rams drafted him last April, potted him, watered him, and hoped  he'd someday grow into a National Football League player.  </P> <P> Next Sunday wasn't what the team had in mind, but here comes Brian Smith, roots  and all.  </P> <P> Injuries to three defensive ends have forced the Rams to alter their long-term  forecast, so much so that Smith will start at right defensive end against the  New York Jets in the team's 3-4 alignment. He's the fourth starter at the  position this season, following Shawn Miller (moved to left end after Doug  Reed's ankle sprain), Mike Piel (dislocated elbow) and Bill Hawkins (partially  torn knee ligament).  </P> <P> Wasn't Smith a linebacker? That was last month. Desperate times warrant  desperate measures.  </P> <P> "Sometimes they say that's the best way to learn, if they just throw you right  into the fire," Smith said.  </P> <P> Smith played some defensive line in college, but it's a long way from Auburn to  the NFL, especially when you're playing out of position.  </P> <P> Smith spent the first 13 weeks on injured reserve with a wrist injury, a polite  way of letting everyone know that he needed more seasoning.  </P> <P> He checked into training camp at 6-feet-6 and 240 pounds, and the Rams pointed  him to the cafeteria. The team says it was thinking of Smith as a defensive end  all along, only they never got around to telling him.  </P> <P> "Actually, there was no indication," he said. "I was just going along during my  time out, and Coach (John) Robinson kept telling me: 'Just get bigger, stronger  and faster.' And that's what I was doing."  </P> <P> Smith now weighs 265 pounds, a 25-pound increase since the summer. At least now  he looks the part. But can he play the part?  </P> <P> "For me, it's just getting out there and playing for a change," he said. "I've  got a lot to learn, and I'm working overtime to learn everything."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Rams are in a playoff chase, which normally isn't the best time  to break new players into the lineup.  </P> <P> But they're out of options. Wednesday, the Rams worked out Sean Smith, an  unemployed defensive tackle and former fourth-round choice of the Chicago  Bears. All measures now are stop-gap.  </P> <P> Robinson said the team might activate linebacker Mark Messner off the  developmental squad and play him at nose-backer in the Eagle defense or on the  line as a stunting tackle.  </P> <P> Messner is one of those "tweeners" -- players who don't fit in well at  linebacker or lineman when you feed his numbers (6-feet-2, 255 pounds) into the  computer.  </P> <P> "But he drives us crazy on the field," Robinson said, complimenting Messner's  instinctive abilities. "But you've got to move him. Moving, he's dangerous."  </P> <P> As for Smith, the future is now. The Rams have been impressed with his growth  during his injured reserve hibernation. By growth here, they mean weight.  </P> <P> "He's gotten huge compared to what he was," defensive coordinator Fritz Shurmur  said. "He was a skinny kid when he got here."  </P> <P> Now he's an NFL starter, if only a few years ahead of schedule.  </P> <P> Someone wondered Wednesday whether John Taylor's touchdown receptions of 95 and  92 yards against the Rams last Monday night were the result of poor defense or  great individual effort by the San Francisco receiver.  </P> <P> Robinson explained: "If I'm running over to the refrigerator to get the last  Coke and you try to tackle me, and you miss, and I get the Coke, is that bad  tackling or did I make a great run for the Coke? I don't know. From our  standpoint, we didn't tackle very good. If I was Taylor's agent, I'd say it was  a brilliant run."  </P> <P> Ram Notes  </P> <P> The team won't make a roster move on Bill Hawkins until Friday, when they can  better determine how long he'll be out with the knee injury suffered in Monday  night's loss. "No one quite knows whether his injury is a two-week injury or a  two-month injury," Coach John Robinson said. If Hawkins could be available by  the second round of the playoffs, assuming the Rams make it that far, the Rams  would keep him on the roster, Robinson said. If not, Hawkins will go on injured  reserve. . . . Some final words on Robinson's fake field goal call against San  Francisco: "It's the first great call I've ever made that failed," Robinson  said. . . . This week's opponent, the New York Jets, are in serious trouble on  and off the field. Neither of the team's top quarterbacks, Ken O'Brien or Pat  Ryan, practiced Wednesday. O'Brien, the starter, has a sore elbow and won't  throw this week, Coach Joe Walton said. Ryan, the backup, suffered a concussion  in Sunday's loss to Pittsburgh. "(Tony) Eason's the only healthy quarterback  we've got," Walton said. . . . Off the field, Walton's job seems in serious  jeopardy now that the team has publicly announced it is actively trying to hire  New England Patriots' General Manager Dick Steinberg to run the Jets' front  office. Walton said Wednesday he wasn't bothered by the speculation. "To the  contrary," he said. "I'm not concerning myself at all about it."  </P></p>

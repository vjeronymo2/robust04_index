			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Daf truck plant attracts rival bids A Pounds 40M-PLUS management buy-out of Leyland Daf's truck assembly plant in Lancashire was agreed in outline early yesterday. Within hours, however, a new bidder had opened talks with the company's administrative receiver to try to thwart the deal. Mr Ian McKinnon, who led the successful management buy-out of Leyland Bus in 1985, saw Mr John Talbot of Arthur Andersen, the joint receiver, late yesterday afternoon. He wants to buy the assembly plant in Leyland, the axle plant at Albion in Glasgow and the spare parts business in Chorley, Lancashire. Leyland Bus was sold to Volvo in 1987. Mr McKinnon is now a senior executive with Alcan, the aluminium company, which is not connected with his bid. He is offering to better the truck assembly buy-out. With the parts business valued at more than Pounds 100m, industry estimates suggest he would need more than Pounds 200m to succeed in buying everything. Mr Talbot said the outline agreement with the management team covered price and 'other critical factors', but was subject to contract. Both sides aim to finalise the deal in the latter half of May. Mr Talbot said in the meanwhile he would 'continue to talk to other interested parties'. Mr McKinnon declined to name two City financial institutions he said were behind him. They still have to carry out their own investigations after obtaining more information from the receiver, and senior debt has still to be negotiated with clearing banks. His advisers include Dickson Minto, a firm of London corporate lawyers specialising in acquisitions and buy-outs. Mr McKinnon was operating from the firm's offices yesterday. The management buy-out team believes other bidders are now out of the running. Its case is that the factory depends on being able to sell trucks throughout the whole of Europe and it has negotiated an agreement with Daf's European dealer network to achieve this. It has a supply agreement with the spare parts business and another to take 65 per cent of the Albion axle output. The Glasgow plant also supplies Leyland Daf vans in Birmingham, which was bought separately by its management last week. This interdependent circle of demand and supply is understood to guarantee the future - and eventual saleability - of all parts of the former Daf business. Mr McKinnon wants to offer the receiver a less complicated deal, taking the whole business and running his own sales and marketing operation. Under the management buy-out deal Lancashire Enterprises, the privatised economic development arm of Lancashire County Council, would buy the entire 230-acre Leyland Daf site and its 1.8m sq ft of factory, and lease 800,000 sq ft for truck assembly to the management buy-out team. Lancashire Enterprises would develop the rest as a technology park. The deal was negotiated by Mr Paul Southern, northern corporate finance partner of Coopers &amp; Lybrand in Leeds.</p>

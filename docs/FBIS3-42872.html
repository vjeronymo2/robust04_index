Bogomolov, director of the Institute of  International Economic and Political Research of the Russian  Academy of Sciences; Academician G.A. Arbatov, director of the  Russian Academy of Sciences U.S. and Canada Institute; A.O.  Chubaryan, director of the Russian Academy of Sciences Institute  of Universal History; Kirill, Metropolitan of Smolensk and  Kaliningrad and chairman of the foreign affairs department of  the Moscow Patriarchy of the Russian Orthodox Church; S.B.  Stankevich, political adviser to the president of Russia; A.M.  Vasilyev, director of the Russian Academy of Sciences Africa  Institute; E.I. Pain, member of the Presidential Council and the  director of the Center for Ethnopolitical and Regional Research;  V.K. Volkov, director of the Russian Academy of Sciences  Institute of Slavic and Balkan Research; and A.A. Iskenderov,  editor in chief of the VOPROSY ISTORII magazine.    The comments of the participants in the discussion are  published below in abridged form.    O.T. Bogomolov: It was good to hear today from the  minister's mouth that the region of East, Central, and Southeast  Europe (for brevity we will use East Europe) should have  priority in our policy and that we should pay more attention to  it and direct more effort into the development of relations with  the countries in that region. The facts bear witness that until  recently this region held, unfortunately, a place far from honor  in our policy; a number of circumstances--perhaps  objective--distracted our attention to somewhat different areas,  and we underestimated East Europe from the standpoint of its  geopolitical location and its significance for the security of  Russia and our trade and economic interests.    I agree with the minister's very correct remark that for us  this region serves as a bridge to Europe--moreover, to the  world. East European countries are closer to West Europe and  they have more experience in establishing relations; besides,  our communications--both transportation and other kinds--with  the West and the world go through this region.    It was also correctly noted that we have common problems of  postcommunist development. It is true that East European  countries are somewhat ahead of us, and their experience--both  political and economic--is very valuable. Had we paid more  attention to what is happening in Poland, the Czech Republic,  and Hungary instead of looking only at models of American  liberal economics, perhaps we could have avoided many extremely  grave consequences of the "shock therapy," which generally is  not working in our country.    It is precisely among the specialists in East European  countries that we frequently find understanding of our  difficulties. They do in-depth research of many sides of this  transition period. We, on the other hand, frequently deal with  very superficial, shallow judgments of specialists from the  International Monetary Fund and other Western scholars.    Speaking about this region, I would like to emphasize not  only the communality of problems but also the not-yet-lost  personal ties, the experience in contacts. We should not forget  that, for instance, in the eastern part of Germany there are  probably at least several hundred thousand people who speak  Russian and know our reality well, not to mention the Czech  Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary, where many people know us well,  speak Russian, and are easy to communicate with.    It seems to me that East Europe is also seriously  underestimated from the standpoint of its importance as a market  for our industry, for our economy, and from the standpoint of  being a supplier of many products. These ties have been  disrupted, which is fraught with serious difficulties, if not  more than that, for a number of sectors of our economy,  especially in transportation, since half of our means of  transportation, especially rail transport, came in the form of  rolling stock and locomotives made in Germany, the Czech  Republic, and Poland. The disintegration of these ties  jeopardizes the operation of our transportation sector.    In this respect it should be noted that we are aware of  moral  liability to these countries--both on the part of the former  USSR and perhaps our own. It is a fact, after all, that hundreds  of thousands of workers are finding themselves laid-off at  enterprises in the Czech Republic and eastern part of Germany  because we cut off the economic specialization ties set up by  the former Soviet Union. We can no longer afford to buy electric  locomotives which used to be the specialty of Czech  factories--we cannot pay for them because the price of each  electric locomotive is now up to 2 billion rubles.    We should also keep in mind that we are seeing a more active  policy on the part of the United States of America, the  countries of the European Community, and especially Germany, in  the East European region, aimed at bringing it into their sphere  of influence, which creates a certain danger of our isolation.  There are many comments by Western public figures regarding the  way they see this region from the standpoint of their interests  and how much they would like to prevent the restoration of  Russian influence in East Europe.    We at the institute draw the following conclusion from the  above: Russia must considerably energize its policy in the  direction of East Europe with the aim of restoring disrupted  neighborly relations, strengthening mutual trust, and finding  new forms for cooperation and security guarantees.    I am very glad to see what the government and the Russian  Federation MFA are doing in this direction; this includes visits  by the Russian Federation president, and other initiatives; of  course, this is all useful. However, in our opinion, we are  still facing a score of unresolved issues both in the area of  East European security and in the area of development of  regional economic cooperation.    The leadership, the diplomatic community, the mass media,  and  the Russian public must show not only in words but prove in deed  that we are interested in the success of free market and  democratic reforms in East European countries, that we are  interested in studying this experience. We also have to show  that we will not be a source of threat to their independence and  freedom.    Now about the new mechanisms and institutes guaranteeing  security in the region. I think that the all-European  process--which, according to Western propaganda, is allegedly  being moved increasingly more to the back burner, and perhaps  interest in it is waning--must nevertheless be promoted by us as  one of the most important priorities, because resolution of the  issues of our own security and security guarantees for East  Europe is linked with the further development of the  all-European process. We also have to admit the fairness of  Western criticism which maintains that documents on the  all-European process do not have any institutional support. Yes,  in this respect perhaps NATO has a number of advantages.    Still, in my opinion, initiatives in the area of common  European security are necessary, and we have to have our own  position. Perhaps it would be more advantageous for us now to  place a certain emphasis on improvement of all-European  institutions within the framework of the Helsinki Agreements, or  put forward our idea of a certain transformation of NATO  stemming from the fact that the alliance is posed to expand its  membership.    In my opinion, the most important aspect of our relations  with East Europe is economic. The East European market is very  valuable for us, because both the Czechs and the Poles are  willing to buy many items we produce. And vice versa, we also  need what they produce very much--I already mentioned means of  transportation; if our transportation sector grinds to a halt,  it will mean the collapse of our economy. Therefore, we have to  look for a solution. To think that such solutions have already  been found on the basis of intergovernment agreements would  probably be an overestimation of their significance, since these  agreements do not entail any specific obligation. In our country  obligations are now the province of enterprises--they deliver  the product, and they buy it.    For the past two to three years our institute has been  attempting to explain to the government the possibility of  setting up a special mechanism for settling accounts with East  European countries, because the clearing method of the past had  a number of shortcomings. We proposed a system of combining in  one large mechanism both trade and clearing functions on the  basis of multilateral barter. It appeared to gain support, but  it turned out to be very difficult to see this idea through to  the end.    There used to be Comecon, which in good time, and probably  for good reason, was disbanded. Still, the need for regional  ties remains. We have attempted to create such a body on the  basis of private business--the International Organization for  Promotion of Regional Cooperation. The institute made space and  some money available to launch this organization. We recently  conducted a meeting of representatives of central banks from  near abroad and East European countries in order to boost these  contacts and exchange information. It would be desirable to have  the government's assistance in creating--perhaps, no longer at  the government but rather the public level, or with the  participation of businessmen--such organizations as could pick  up where we left off after the elimination of Comecon. We have  to look for new forms--not the kind that have discredited  themselves, such as Comecon or the Warsaw Pact--but different  ones that would facilitate the development of this regionalism  with our participation.    A.O. Chubaryan: I think that bringing the issue of  East Europe to the consideration of the council is extremely  useful. In my opinion, Russia's position with respect to East  Europe has a bearing on a more general problem--the concept of  Russian foreign policy, on one hand, and on the other--the new  configuration in Europe as we approach the 21st century.    I agree with Andrey Vladimirovich's opinion that we have  passed the first stage with respect to East Europe--clearing the  debris; but as always, there is still something left. We are now  entering the most difficult stage: defining new relations. There  exists--although many would deny it--a certain resistance on the  part of the West against restoring our positions in East Europe.  I think that the next stage will be a protracted and hard one  for us.    The first direction, as I see it, is bilateral relations.  Signing agreements, and the very useful visits by the president  of the Russian Federation, have created a foundation, but it  seems to me that this layer is very thin and only the upper one.  The entire infrastructure of Russia's ties with East Europe,  destroyed as a result of the collapse of the regimes that we all  had, resulted in the destruction of the old, but the new is not  yet in place. We have to a large extent practically lost the  ties we had with them along social lines. In this respect the  minister remarked correctly on the human factor--the old  generation is leaving the scene, and we are not establishing any  ties with the new generation. Therefore, I think, the first task  is to restore the infrastructure along all lines: cultural,  scientific, and social. This task is not limited to the MFA--it  applies to all organizations and structures. But the MFA should  act as a coordinating organization in this regard.    The representatives of our new party are weak. The growing  parties are eager to establish contacts within the framework of  association of liberal parties and social democrats. But I have  not heard or seen them establishing active contacts with the  respective East European Christian or federal social-democratic  parties. Something that is closer to home for me--science, for  instance; in this respect contacts are extremely limited. This  is a result of lack of money and, of course, a certain  apprehension that exists in East European countries. Therefore,  in my belief, this is a global direction that we should  persistently pursue; we need to establish a new infrastructure  of Russian-Polish, Russian-Czech, Russian-Bulgarian,  Russian-Romanian, and other ties using all sorts of levers.    The second point, the second direction, is regionalism.  Currently all Europe is gripped by a very active renaissance of  regional ideas. Why would Russian diplomacy not advance new  initiatives in this direction? I agree with the idea already put  forward here that we need to use East European countries in  order to give a boost to our ties with the West. I am convinced  that restoration of the status of Russia as a great power will  depend to a great extent on the place and influence we  restore--or retain--in East European countries, not to mention  CIS countries. We are not talking about the restoration of old,  even allied relations, but it is quite obvious that we need to  work in this direction. In this we need to use historic and many  other traditions. Especially considering that, as we know, and  as already emphasized today, the main hurdles have been cleared.    I think we need some kind of initiative line with respect to  our "presence" in the resolution of various problems. We could  probably use various political levers associated, among other  things, with the security system.    I also believe that the all-European process is skidding  because ideas sink into the sand. We probably should advance new  ideas for the institutionalization of potential regional and  common European security projects. In this respect I believe  that the already mentioned "Balladur Plan" is interesting. But I  will say frankly, Andrey Vladimirovich, that Russia already  today, while it is getting to its feet, is capable of claiming  its own plan of vision from Moscow. In the past we played a  great role in creating an all-European system; perhaps now we  should bring experts and politicians into this and propose our  concept of Europe at the threshold of the 21st century. Our  initiatives in these matters will increase both the general  importance and significance of Russia in these matters.    And, finally and lastly: I think we should restore and  expand  some of the forms of cooperation with East European countries  that existed in the past. I have in mind historical science. We,  Russian historians, have already traveled our part of the road  with respect to East European countries in the sense of  admitting our mistakes. I believe that we could now return to  the idea of reactivating certain joint projects with them  involving historical traditions, summarizing the experience of  cooperation with this countries. We are open to this; we are  ready. I want to inform you that in the historical sciences  alone we have already restored, at the initiative of Bucharest,  a Romanian-Russian commission of historians, and at the  initiative of Prague--a Czech-Russian commission of historians.  We take a rather flexible position in our relations with them;  we are agreeable to include in the research the issues they are  interested in. We should help East European historians make use  of our archives. This would be extremely useful.    Metropolitan Kirill: I would like to express  gratitude for the opportunity for the Russian Orthodox Church to  participate in the Foreign Policy Council, and for the new style  of relations that has been established with the Russian Orthodox  Church.    I would like to start from a perhaps unexpected premise.  First, from the general tone of the document distributed to us  entitled "Theses for Discussion." A certain axiom that is not  questioned is built a priori into the basis of this document;  this axiom may be described as follows. There is a strategic  goal in Russia's foreign policy, which is formulated as the  integration of Russia into the so-called civilized world, or  Western world. Following that, everything we find in this  document is tied to this goal. East Europe and Central Europe  are seen through the prism of the extent to which our relations  with East and Central Europe will further or hamper this  integration.    I thank Andrey Vladimirovich for his introductory comments,  which helped me to understand that at least in the MFA  leadership, too, there are synonyms to the notion of  "integration." I would like to insist that in terms of our  domestic policy, in terms of the popular attitude to foreign  policy activities of the government, it would be more correct,  more psychologically correct, more politically appropriate,  instead of the notion of integration to use those synonyms the  minister suggested today in speaking of partnership,  cooperation, and allied relations. And in this sense there is  nothing new in Russian policy. The point is that all of us,  being the children of the recent Soviet past, have been shaped  by the foreign policy of the Soviet Union, whether we like it or  not. And for us the notion of "allied relations with Russia" is  something strange, is some kind of discovery, and for a very  considerable spectrum of our social forces it is a betrayal of  our national interests, because people still act on the premise  of this short historic context delimited by the 75-plus years of  Soviet power. But Russia is not 70 years old. It is almost more  than 1,000 years old. Let us work on the basis of this  historical context.    In this respect Russia has always had allied relations with  the West (France, Austria, Germany), but nobody in Petersburg  ever seriously entertained the thought that these allied  relations assume Russia's integration into Germany, Austria,  France, or West Europe. Therefore, I think, we need to  understand the following.    Sometimes terms we use rather frivolously--and this also may  be the result of our Soviet education--are not meant to convey  any particular ideas, but those who listen to us often interpret  these terms in a way detrimental to us. I am deeply convinced  that Russia's foreign policy today does not assume such  integration into West Europe that could jeopardize the value of  Russia in its own right as a great Eurasian state. But the use  of the term "integration," especially in the context of  integration into the civilized world--it is very hard to  understand what exactly this means. As if Russia with its  1,000-year culture is not part of the civilized world. Well, it  is better to avoid this phraseology. I would like you to  understand me correctly: This comment is linguistic, not  political, in nature, but since terminology in politics is a  matter of some importance, I would like to insist that we use  correct terminology in putting together the documents coming  from our foreign policy agency.    Now on substance. Can we seriously speak of integrating  Russia into West Europe--let us agree that for the moment we are  using this term in the good sense of the word, in the sense that  Belgium, Holland, Luxembourg, Italy, France, and Germany are  integrated into Europe? I think we should ask a serious  question: To what extent is it justifiable at all to speak of  such a goal? Whether we like it not, Russia is a fait accompli;  it is the result of 1,000 years of historical development. It is  not merely a country--it is the immense Eurasian continent with  a colossal, unprecedented potential in both material and  intellectual resources. It is another matter that Russia  currently is in a position of extreme hardship, and that we may  speak of some degeneration of our potential. But a lot of time  will have to pass before Russia degenerates. And I am convinced  that this will never happen. So we are indeed talking about a  colossal potential.    The question arises as to whether this colossal potential  can  be integrated into the Western economic and political system in  such a way that it would be first acceptable for the Western  system, and permissible in substance for Russia. I think not.  Russia will never be integrated in the Western system the way  other countries are integrated in it because Russia is Russia;  because Russia stretches from Kaliningrad practically to  Chukotka; because Russia is an immense Eurasian community. In  the same sense one cannot speak seriously of integrating the  United States into West Europe. Such integration also will never  happen, despite the existence of a communality of political  interests, but with respect to economic interests I do not think  there is any particular communality, although economists would  be in a better position to comment on this. And that is not to  mention cultural antagonisms.    Speaking of Russia's relations with the Western world, we  need to speak of cooperation, partnership, and even allied  relations, although every time we should think through very  carefully what exactly we mean by allied relations.  Nevertheless, the arguments presented by Andrey Vladimirovich  greatly impressed me. That is, we do not know what would be  happening now in the geographic regions of the CIS had we not  registered at this stage our allied relations with Western  countries. This is a very strong argument. This does not mean at  all that we should be allies always and under any circumstances.  Politics is a dynamic and flexible business; at some point we  may be allies, at some point our views may diverge and relations  cool. But most importantly, Russia must remain a geopolitical  center, which it always will be. Moreover, the world needs it.    In the context of this line of thinking let me touch on  Central and East Europe. First, it has been correctly noted here  that we have neglected East Europe. This has been a terrible  hypocrisy. On one hand we kept saying that they were our  brothers and allies, that this was the socialist camp. But let  us put it straight: In reality Soviet foreign policy's attitude  to East Europe was contemptuous.    Soviet policy divided the world into first- and second-class  countries, and the tragedy, lies, and ambiguity of our position  were that the USSR's allies were in reality considered  second-class countries. I must confess the church's sin as well.  This imprint, this pressure of political ideals was reflected in  church affairs as well. We worked on building relations with the  United States, with Greece, but we forgot that there were  Bulgarians. We believed that they, our brothers, would always be  there. If one takes the calendar of foreign relations activities  of the Russian church for those years, unfortunately, events  along the line of relations with East Europe took last place,  even after Africa and Asia.    It was put quite correctly here that what happened in East  Europe is our moral liability, sin, and fault. Now it is  necessary if not to set East Europe apart as a special priority  then at least to place it at the same level in our relations  that we have placed West European countries, the United States,  and Japan.    In this connection I wanted to mention that we, in our  church  activities, are planning a number of substantive actions. As is  known, during his visit to our country the president of Hungary  invited the Holy Patriarch to visit. There are invitations from  Catholic Poland. In addition to the Holy Patriarch's visit to  Hungary, we plan trips to Poland, as well as Yugoslavia and  Bulgaria. We want very much to correct the imbalance that has  existed in our church's policy with respect to East European  countries.    I would also like to note that if Russia becomes attractive  to East Europe, all the problems in our relations will be  resolved. What would make us attractive? Domestic political  stability, and the resolution first and foremost of economic  problems. We will not be attractive today by selling them cheap  raw materials. Then they will say that Russians remain, as they  always have been, poor politicians. We must maintain a dignified  position in both the economic and political spheres.    S.B. Stankevich: What is Central, East, and  Southeast Europe for Russia now? So far there is no sound and  consistent vision or systematically formulated answer to this  question. The "Brezhnev Doctrine," which was mentioned here, is  a thing of the past; what do we have to replace it? Apparently  not the "Monroe Doctrine," as the press has been writing and the  corresponding suspicions voiced, including by the Western press.  Apparently, something else. And perhaps, in continuation of the  philological research proposed here by Metropolitan Kirill, we  should resurrect such a term--not at all bad--as "vital  interests."    Truly, this is a sphere of vital interests of Russia; there  is no better word for it, and hardly anyone will argue with  this, because we are linked with this region by a thousand  economic, spiritual, and cultural threads; the well-being of  Russia or lack thereof depends if not 100 percent then to a  considerable extent on what will happen here, and it is indeed a  sphere of our vital interests.    The fact that we postulate our vital interests in connection  with East Europe does not give us any special rights in this  region. It means only one thing: In allocating our attention,  cadres, resources, and efforts, including diplomatic ones, it is  substantially more important than the esteemed and respected but  far more removed countries. Although all of us here seem to  agree that this is a priority for us, this priority for us must  be expressed in a quite obvious and visible way. For instance,  key issues--diplomatic cadres, resources, including those  supporting the activities of diplomatic representations; time  spent on it; the frequency and level of visits in both  directions; the agreement-legal base that exists in  relations--these are the visible expression of this priority  standing which has been, quite appropriately, noted here.    We are about to close--I cannot say that we have already  closed--a whole era of relations with this region. And it seems  that we should close it in a dignified and significant manner.  There is a dearth of program statements in this respect,  essentially of doctrinal nature. Some sort of statement closing  the entire era in relations with East Europe apparently is  needed, in which we would summarize the past and define Russia's  position as it enters a new era in relations.    Russia's responsibility for what was happening to East  European countries during this nearly past era has already been  mentioned here. But there are quite persistent attempts to turn  this responsibility into a political and legal one. This we can  hardly accept and agree with. It was not democratic Russia that  invaded the Baltics in 1939, or sent troops into Hungary in 1956  and Czechoslovakia in 1968. In my opinion, it would be  completely incorrect to mechanically transfer the liability for  what happened in the preceding era onto the current, democratic  Russia. Yes, without any doubt in a moral sense we still have  certain feelings and obligations.    All this, however, should not grow into a complex of  national  and historic fault, which multiplies in daily politics. For  this, by the way, we need to close certain pages of history,  specific episodes. The problem of historical episodes, concrete  memorials, burial grounds, and cultural legacy is very  important; it has considerable repercussions, is played out  constantly in politics, and influences it. Therefore any  incidents involving violation of military memorials or some or  other artifacts of material and spiritual culture in some ways  related to Russia--in such instances, I think, Russia's reaction  should be sufficiently sensitive and diplomatic, but there must  be a reaction, there cannot be none, for we are rapidly losing  the status of a great power to be reckoned with.    As to various geopolitical combinations that are currently  emerging, we can probably agree with the contention that it is  not associations or blocs per se that are bad--it is, of course,  their content.    Regarding the question of integration. I do not think that  the word "integration" should scare us that much. It is another  matter that integration into the civilized world sounds  absolutely absurd and unacceptable. But integration, if we  understand by it entry into a certain system of existing  international relations--yes. Not integration with Germany, not  integration with France, but integration into a certain system  of interrelations. For this, however, Russia must become itself,  become a state; clearly and firmly define its new role, its  place, its interests; formulate them, because only such  qualitative definitiveness can be integrated into something  without dissolving in it. And Russia itself must decide with  whom and to what extent, on what terms and in what forms it will  integrate, meaning integration into the system of existing  interrelations. Then in principle we can agree with the term  itself; I do not think it should sound so threatening.    Now regarding NATO. Over the past few years, in trying to  adapt NATO to currently existing realities in Europe and in the  world, the NATO leadership has of course done a lot in the  direction of changing the nature of this bloc, but its  qualitative definition so far remains the same, despite recently  adopted documents. It remains a military-political bloc, with  the emphasis on the first part--military; it was formed and  continues to exist on the premise that there exists a certain  threat from the east, more or less real in some or other eras,  but it exists, this constant threat from the east, for the sake  of which this bloc must exist and function. There are thousands  of different-level documents, not necessarily doctrinal ones,  and various sorts of instructions, up to military regulations,  that reflect the existence of this threat and in accordance to  which NATO structures conduct their life, which have not been  revised. And in this connection, since it is a dynamic process,  it is important who is ahead. We can probably formulate this  principle--that the restructuring of NATO's internal structure,  the change in the internal content of NATO, should proceed ahead  of the process of its geographic expansion. Most likely Russia  will be unable to stop any East European state from joining NATO  if it seriously wants to. The "Brezhnev Doctrine" should be left  behind, but if anyone is interested in Russia's opinion, our  position in this respect should be quite clear: We do not  encourage this process; we do not wish to accelerate it; we urge  caution and prudence in any change of balance. And it probably  makes sense to insist that internal restructuring of NATO should  precede the process of geographic expansion of this bloc.    Another point of substance in the discussion is our economic  relations with East European countries. Yes, indeed, we need to  restore what was destroyed by ignorance. But it hardly makes  sense to limit ourselves to simple restoration of these  technological chains that have been broken, now that workers are  being laid off at factories that used to work for Russia. It  probably makes sense to look a little beyond that. Principally  new conditions have already come into play; the free market is  not in place yet, but market relations have emerged in all East  European countries, including Russia, and we need to make use of  these relations. It would be quite logical to bring up the  question that Russia can stimulate the movement of capital and  goods to both near abroad countries and the states of East,  Southeast, and Central Europe.    On cooperation between political forces. The paradox is that  it is the left-wing and postcommunist forces that are  pro-Russian in East European countries, while the greatest  anti-Russian attitudes are most often noted among the democratic  forces, which maintain that Russia should be left in the past  altogether, since it brought them only grief and misfortune, and  that they need to unilaterally orientate themselves toward the  West. This sort of anti-Russian prejudice, common among  democratic forces in East European countries, is to a large  extent the fault of Russian democratic forces, which are not  establishing direct contacts with them, not conducting intensive  enough interparty exchanges with these countries, preferring to  visit other places. Hence the complex of not understanding the  new Russia, once again by inertia perceiving it as an imperial  threat. Therefore, it is quite important to break this  situation, to establish normal contacts with parties and  organizations of democratic spectrum in East Europe, and this  task may be encouraged and supported by the MFA.    A.M. Vasilyev: I would like to try to build a  hierarchy of priorities and compare the significance of the East  European region to other regions that are closer to me--the  southern regions. I would build this kind of structure: In the  first place, of course, are the near abroad countries; in the  second--the West as a whole, including the United States; I  would not put East Europe even in third place--I think more  likely it should be China and the Far East; when we come to the  fourth and fifth place--here we may have a certain competition:  After all, East Europe is already separated from us by hundreds  of kilometers of borders of several independent states. At the  same time, right next to us there are states--I mean the  Transcaucasus and Central Asia--which are practically turning  into the Near East, and their problems are overlapping our  borders.    Russia's relations with these southern regions may compete  with East Europe in importance and significance for Russia. And  not only that. The Near East is inside us if we take into  account that Russia is home to 8-9 million Muslims with their  political, social, and other value orientations that are the  same as the "Third World."    These regions to a certain extent are also linked to our  relations with East Europe. Russia exports oil and gas, but in  practical terms an increasingly greater part of that oil and gas  is what we will be buying there, in the East, reselling ours to  the West. That is, we are playing the role of a transit  territory. And it is impossible to define our relations with one  region without taking the other into account.    Russia's destiny is not to oppose the West, not to march  against it, not be in confrontation with it; but we cannot  become an integral part of the West even if we wanted to,  because we are different, and Russia's historic destiny is  different. In this connection I, as a person whose field is the  "Third World," believe categorically that identification of our  policy with the policy of the West could hurt Russia's interests  in the "Third World."    Concluding my brief interference into the discussion of  specialists on Europe, I would like to emphasize that we should  not separate our relations with East Europe from the problems we  face on our southern borders because of the special position of  Russia--a gigantic country spanning two continents. Separating  one from the other may lead to certain mistakes and  miscalculations in Russian policy.    V.K. Volkov: I believe that in our discussion of  the problems of East Europe and Russian policy there exists a  general acute conceptual deficiency not on a regional but on a  global level. Before we speak of a region, we should first look  at the future, look not only at the way we and the world are  today, but also imagine what the world will be in three to five  years. We will not be able to peer too far into the future, but  we could perhaps look at a span of 15 years. Perhaps then we  will have a clearer idea regarding East Europe.    I think that today's world creates confusion in many heads.  The bipolar arrangement has disappeared, but will the currently  prevalent unipolar one survive? Unlikely. International  relations are a self-regulating system, and it does not tolerate  unipolar situations. One way or another it will begin to  differentiate. And I will permit myself to suggest that in the  near future we will witness a new disposition of international  forces or, in short, several years from now the world will be  very different from what it is today. And then we will indeed be  able to define the place of East Europe in the system of  priorities of Russia's policy.    In Russian history, the Central European direction--to be  specific, Poland and Czechoslovakia, as well as the Balkans--has  always been at the center of our diplomacy. Therefore, if we now  look at this all in a new way, distancing ourselves somewhat  from history and emotions, we will simply see that the role of  Russia and its policy in East Europe is a litmus test that shows  the real place of the Russian Federation in the world arena.    I think we need to see our potential strong points, bases in  East Europe. Among the countries here that already now clearly  lean toward political cooperation with Russia one can name the  Czech Republic, Slovakia, Yugoslavia, and Greece. This is not  only a legacy of the former socialist camp, but also restoration  of certain traditional contacts.    As to our economic ties, they do indeed have their  specificity. But at the same time we should not lose sight of  the fact that the former Soviet Union has managed to build  economic relations with East European countries in such a way  that it has become an agrarian and raw material appendix to its  own "satellites."    I completely agree with those who advocated here an active  policy with respect to East European countries. This activism  may be of very different varieties, but we probably should  indeed push aside all fears and not be afraid to say loudly that  we have interests in East Europe. I believe that the conduct of  an active Russian policy should begin with deciding where there  are grounds for it. I do not see a problem more important for  Russia than halting economic sanctions with respect to  Yugoslavia. They have turned into a complete absurdity.</p>

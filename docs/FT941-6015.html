			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / International Company News: Banco Mello net improves Banco Mello, a Portuguese bank privatised in 1991, yesterday announced a 1.2 per cent improvement in net profits to Es1bn (Dollars 5.7m) for 1993, compared with 1992. Cash flow rose 20 per cent to Es2.3bn. Net assets grew 34 per cent to Es124bn. The bank plans to hold its dividend at Es70 a share, and proposes to increase share capital from Es9bn to Es18bn this year through a rights issue. It said an allocation of Es2.3bn in provisions against bad debt had increased its coverage of doubtful credit from 48 per cent in 1992 to 87 per cent but had slowed profit growth.</p>

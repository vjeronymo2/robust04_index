			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Incentive schemes must meet particular needs Sir, Re the Lex column on executive pay (February 1), and as one who was partly involved in the design of the Reuters executive incentive scheme, I feel that the move from executive share options to restricted shares and the use of relative total shareholder return as a measure (to quantify corporate performance) are to be widely welcomed. This approach breaks the 1980s mould of executive remuneration. In the last decade, the long-term elements of executive pay have been shaped at least as much by tax considerations as by the specific requirements of individual companies. As a result, most quoted companies at present have long-term incentive schemes which are all but identical. The new Reuters scheme should certainly contribute to the debate on executive remuneration. However, a risk exists that some companies will simply see the new scheme as a template to be followed to introduce executive incentive schemes in exactly the same format. They may not question the suitability of such arrangements for their own circumstances - failing to raise questions in that context may not be in their best interests. In considering changes in their long-term incentive schemes, companies should seriously heed the joint statement, issued last year, by the National Association of Pension Funds and Association of British Insurers (see Letters, February 11). That statement requires the remuneration committee of a company to choose a measure (and presumably a scheme) which is appropriate for that company and to justify that measure and scheme to shareholders. If Reuters is to be followed, therefore, it should be for the way that it has approached executive remuneration to meet its own needs.

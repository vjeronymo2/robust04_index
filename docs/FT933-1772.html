			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Ivernia lead/zinc study nearing completion IVERNIA West, the Irish minerals exploration company, yesterday announced a reduced loss for the year of IPounds 460,000 (Pounds 433,000), down from IPounds 1.48m, and confirmed its belief that the Lisheen joint venture, in which it has a 47.5 per cent interest, was the largest lead/zinc discovery in Europe for decades. Feasibility and environmental studies at Lisheen are nearing completion and will shortly be presented to the joint venture, the directors said. Following this, the joint venture would lodge a full planning application. Minorco, a 24.5 per cent shareholder in Ivernia and Ivernia's intended 50 per cent partner in the project, has made loans of some Dollars 3m (Pounds 1.9m) available to the company along with sums to cover land acquisition costs. Progress on the project has been balked by difficulties arising from Chevron's decision to dispose of its 52.5 per cent interest in Lisheen. Chevron had agreed to sell its interest to Ivernia, and had accepted a Dollars 5m deposit. However, completion of the sale has been delayed by a challenge in the Dublin High Court by Lac Minerals. Ivernia also announced that agreement had been reached for the disposal of its Famous Blue gold deposit along with its Double A plant and equipment for ADollars 1.2m (Pounds 510,000) in cash and shares. All of Ivernia's remaining Australian assets have been acquired by Leader Resources, in which Ivernia has a 20.5 per cent interest.</p>

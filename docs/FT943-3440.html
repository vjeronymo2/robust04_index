			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Arts: New look at 'The Picture of Dorian Gray' - Theatre The Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith, has a new artistic regime, and it will be positively disappointing if it does not prove controversial. Neil Bartlett, its new artistic director, has a wide-ranging talent: he performs, he directs, he translates, he writes; he brings Shakespeare, Marivaux, Victorian melodrama and Ruth Rendell to the stage. But that is not where the controversy should lie. Bartlett is gay, and few people in British theatre, if any, are working harder than he to demonstrate how broad and complex a gay sensibility can be. Yet around almost all his stagings - whether period or modern, comic or serious - hangs the same heavy aura of camp, like clouds of incense in the air. This atmosphere reminds me of the work of Lindsay Kemp, though Bartlett has infinitely more restraint and refinement. Their similarities lies in an un-British appetite for melodrama, in a lack of innocence, in a (sometimes joyous) sense of doom, and in a climate of knowing decadence. Bartlett's opening production at the Lyric is his adaptation of The Picture of Dorian Gray, and it is a perfect demonstration both of his considerable talent and of the drawbacks that go with that talent. Not only does he tell Oscar Wilde's 1890 novel, he also interleaves it with a subsequent tale of various of Wilde's friends meeting in 1924 to read the novel and act it out and reminisce and discuss. The intersection of life and art is one of Bartlett's specialties. The friends of Wilde who assemble for this 1924 reading of the loved book are Ada Leversohn, Reggie Turner, Robbie Ross, and Sidney 'Jenny' Mavor: each intimate with separate facets of Wilde the artist and man. Even now, they avoid calling a spade a spade - but this works to surprisingly powerful effect. The great scandal of Wilde's career, the private life that was rendered public, the cause of his appalling ostracisation from British society: all this grows melodramatically in everybody's mind, like - Bartlett forces us to see the parallel - the hidden portrait of Dorian Gray, forever growing more repellent because of being secreted and repressed. To this double melodrama - the scandals of both Dorian Gray and Oscar Wilde  -Bartlett adds further melodrama of another kind: the musical kind, whereby characters speak, often but not always, over a dramatic musical accompaniment, as in some 19th-century music (and as in film). Nicholas Bloomfield is Bartlett's composer, and his score, for six stringed instruments and harp, has Bartlett's feeling for atmosphere and intensity but not his achievement of one single style. The music indulges in all kinds of 19- and 20th-century effects, it swoops and scoops and pulsates and camps . . . 'Decadent', the word wrongly attached to Wilde and only partly true of Bartlett, is utterly right for Bloomfield. (The musicians play high above the action, on an upper level of Ian MacNeil's handsomely atmospheric, triangular and successfully claustrophobic set.) I have saved the best till last. The six actors whom Bartlett has assembled for this production are superb, and it looks as if they have profited from detailed stylistic direction from Bartlett and/or his co-director Leah Hausman. Tim Pigott-Smith is Robbie Ross and Basil Hallward, Maria Aitken is Ada Leversohn, Benedick Bates is the Boy in the Guards and Dorian Gray, Joanna Riding is the Maid and Sybil Vane, Paul Shaw is Sidney Mavor, and - best of all - Bette Bourne is Reggie Turner and Lord Henry Wotton. These actors come from widely different backgrounds, and this fact only supports the strangeness of the meeting that Bartlett puts onstage. All of them handle with great precision the conflicting mixture of sympathy and malice in the air, the varying degrees of emotion and repression and melodramatics involved. Everything is beautifully focused. The many meanings of Wilde's tale - Dorian Gray as Ganymede, Alcibiades, Mlle de Maupin, Mr Hyde - grow as you watch. Bartlett's taste and style deserve to be controversial; his professionalism is beyond reproach. At the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith, W6, until October 15; then touring to the Nottingham Playhouse.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Seven O'Clock Newscast"] </F>   [Text] The Administrative Department of Security [DAS]  today rejected Amnesty International charges that this security  organization has lists of Patriotic Union [UP] members to be  eliminated by DAS agents. The DAS director was taken off guard  by three letters from Amnesty International representatives in  France, Great Britain, and Switzerland. The letters, which  arrived simultaneously, accused the DAS of planning a number of  selective murders of UP members and of eliminating and murdering  people who have been detained. DAS Director Fernando Britto Ruiz  categorically denied this is an institutional policy and added  that there is not the slightest chance it could occur. Britto  announced that he will sue Amnesty International for making  baseless accusations against the DAS.    [Begin Britto recording] I don't think an organization of  this kind should make baseless accusations. They are obligated  to justify their charges and must be held accountable for them.  [end recording]    Britto said the UP members who Amnesty International said  were going to be murdered by the DAS are actually under DAS  protection and are in good health.</p>

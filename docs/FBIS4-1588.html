			<p>BFN     [Text] United Nations, March 31 (XINHUA) -- The UN Security  Council issued a presidential statement today, calling on the  DPRK to adopt a cooperative approach on the issue of nuclear  inspection.    In the statement the UN Security Council urged the DPRK to  fulfill its obligations under the nuclear safeguards agreement  it signed with the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and  the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty by allowing IAEA inspectors  to carry out the inspections agreed by the two sides on 15  February 1994.    The statement also urged the DPRK to resume dialogue with  the  ROK or member states of the UN Security Council in order to  reach an agreement with the ROK and IAEA on the implementation  of the Declaration of the Denuclearization of the Korean  peninsula.    In a speech at UN Security Council consultations today, Chen  Jian, Chinese deputy permanent representative to the United  Nations, gave a full account of China's stand on finding a  political solution to the Korean nuclear issue.    Chen Jian said: On the Korean nuclear issue, China's  consistent two aims are denuclearization of the Korean peninsula  and the safeguarding and maintenance of peace and stability in  the region. Therefore, every action the international community  takes ought to be conducive to these two aims. Practice has  shown that the three bilateral dialogue and negotiations  involving the four parties represent the fundamental way for  settling the Korean nuclear issue. Any threat or pressure would  only intensify contradictions and thus have a destructive effect.    He said that thanks to the concerted efforts of all the  parties concerned, many positive factors emerged earlier in  regard to the Korean nuclear issue. Of late, some new  difficulties have appeared concerning the issue of inspection of  the DPRK's nuclear facilities. These are difficulties amid  continuous progress. So long as the parties concerned remain  calm and patient, the problems can be solved properly. The  Chinese delegation believes that it is essential now to create a  good atmosphere and an environment of relaxation [kuan song huan  jing 1401 2646 3883 1064] so that the parties concerned can  resume the three bilateral talks involving four parties.</p>

			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Video Royalty: Prince Charles plays an environmentally friendly heir to the  British throne in his comic video debut with John Cleese.  </P> <P> The royal thespian has a key role in "Grime Goes Green: Your Business and the  Environment." The 30-minute video premiered Thursday at a meeting sponsored by  Business in the Environment, which published an environmental guidebook for  industry. Cleese plays James Grime, a decidedly un-green industrialist who is  shown frantically cleaning his plant ahead of a royal visit. The prince tells  him that "if everybody's going to wait for a royal visit before they clean up  their act, we'll never get anywhere. . . ." CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

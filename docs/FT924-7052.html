			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / International Company News: MGM posts reduced deficit in third term METRO-Goldwyn-Mayer, the Hollywood studio now controlled by its French bank creditor Credit Lyonnais, has posted a third-quarter operating loss of Dollars 27.2m, com-pared with Dollars 52.5m a year earlier. Including one-time items and interest expenses, MGM's net deficit was Dollars 79.8m in the quarter, against Dollars 73.3m in the same period of 1991. Revenues rose to Dollars 228.5m from Dollars 202.2m, led by video and television licensing. MGM is still struggling to clean up its balance sheet after being run for nearly a year by Mr Giancarlo Parretti, the controversial Italian financier who lost control of the studio in December. The company said it had stepped up production and development since Mr Parretti's departure, but it did not expect these activities to be reflected in its results until next year. For the first nine months, MGM suffered an operating loss of Dollars 79.4m on revenues of Dollars 722.3m, compared with an operating loss of Dollars 110.9m on revenues of Dollars 703m a year earlier. The company's net deficit for the 1992 period stood at Dollars 193.5m against Dollars 233.2m. Live Entertainment, the video distribution company 49.9 per cent owned by the cash-strapped Carolco Hollywood studio, yesterday posted third-quarter net income of Dollars 1.1m, or 5 cents a share, against a net loss of Dollars 40.5m, or Dollars 3.39, last year. Sales in the quarter rose to Dollars 91.2m from Dollars 85.7m. The group said its improved results in the latest quarter were due partly to higher sales and gross profit margins at Live Home Video. In the 1991 third quarter, there was a Dollars 15m write-down in connection with its acquisition of Vestron in July 1991. The company said it expected its 'sales and profits will continue to reflect this improvement in the fourth quarter'.</p>

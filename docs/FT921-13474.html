			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Parties clash over polling statistics - Pre-Election Campaigning THE POLITICAL war of words turned into a battle of statistics yesterday as Labour issued the results of its private polling, which showed public discontent with the Tory record. The Conservatives, meanwhile, claimed that 'eight out of 10 voters think Labour would put up their taxes'. But the data on which these claims were based was called into question after Mrs Gillian Shephard, the Treasury minister, conceded that the Tories' figures revealed merely that 85 per cent of those polled believed a Labour government would raise taxes. Despite a misleading headline on the news release, the form of words put by Gallup to interviewees did not examine whether voters' thought their own tax bills would go up. Labour has repeatedly stressed that independent analysis shows 91 per cent of British families would either gain or not be affected by their tax changes. In a letter to Tory chairman Mr Chris Patten, Mr Jack Cunningham, Labour's campaign co-ordinator, said Mrs Shephard's claims alongside a similarly worded poster were fresh evidence of a 'deliberate campaign of premeditated dishonesty'. He went on to demand a public apology and the withdrawal of the poster campaign. Tory officials, however, rejected the charges and claimed that the press notice distributed with the figures was a legitimate political interpretation of their meaning. 'Whose taxes do you suppose the respondents to the surveywere thinking would go up?' asked Mr Chris Patten, Tory chairman. With election fever continuing at a high pitch in Westminster yesterday, the row came as an indicator of the high stakes being placed on voters' responses to the charges and counter-charges levelled by the two main parties. Under the Labour data, from a poll conducted by National Opinion Polls, a sample of 865 voters showed 61 per cent believed the general state of Britain was worse over the 13 years of Conservative government, while 21 per cent said things were better. Questioned on their attitude to six specific sectors - unemployment, education, the economy in general, the National Health Service, crime and the interviewee's personal financial situation - more voters perceived a deterioration than an improvement. However, on one question - that of Britain's standing in the world - the Conservatives had the advantage, with 38 per cent of respondents saying this was 'better', 33 per cent saying it was 'worse' and 29 per cent opting for a neither or don't know response. Labour released the finding because polling companies' codes of practice require that all relevant questions are released if data is to be published. Some of these codes also suggest that enquirers have the right to ask if any other questions were asked that shed light on the findings. In the case of the Conservatives' tax question, Gallup conceded yesterday that a further question had been asked but declined to reveal its wording or the responses of the interviewees. Labour party officials speculated that it might have sought to gauge how much voters' would prefer tax cuts against increases in public expenditure. If the findings have been unfavourable to the Tories - showing a preference for more public spending - this would explain the Conservatives' reluctance for the evidence to be made public, the Labour officials said.</p>

			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Retail sales The July retail sales figures help to explain why food retailing shares have outperformed the stock market by almost 20 per cent over the past six months. Food retailers' volumes in July were up 6.9 per cent on the same month last year, the strongest growth for more than a decade. Despite, or perhaps because of, all the price war headlines, sales by value were up 7.8 per cent. Admittedly, the sweltering weather probably helped in July, boosting sales of added-value salads at the expense of baked beans. But the trend in food sales goes back longer, as the good figures for the past three months show. Quite why the food retailers are gaining more than their fair share of shoppers' spending is less obvious. It may be, as Argos argued this week, that the impact of April's tax increases has made consumers more cautious when it comes to spending on durables, although they still have plenty of money for food and smaller discretionary purchases. Alternatively, it may reflect the efforts of the big supermarket chains to sharpen up pricing, promotion, merchandising and service. In addition to strong sales growth, the superstores are regaining some gross margin, defying pessimists who predicted a spiral of decline and prompting analysts to upgrade their forecasts. The discounters are not yet causing the damage many had predicted and there are increasing signs that market leaders are fighting back effectively. It is no coincidence that shares in Kwik Save have been largely left behind in the sector's rally.</p>

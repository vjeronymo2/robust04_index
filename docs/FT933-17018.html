			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Vietnam likely to rejoin IMF THE CLINTON administration is expected to lift US opposition to Vietnam's reinstatement in the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, allowing the country to clear its arrears and resume borrowing from the international development institutions. A plan for France, the UK, Germany and Japan to provide bridging finance to allow Vietnam to clear its Dollars 140m (Pounds 93.3m) arrears with the IMF has been ready for some time now, but Vietnam's backers have been reluctant to move ahead without at least an orange light from the US. Vietnam experts say the country actually has enough currency reserves to pay off the arrears on its own, however the bridging finance would avoid jeopardising Vietnam's economic ratios while opening the door to financing from the IMF, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. President Clinton is caught between US commercial interests, which have watched angrily as other countries have entered the promising Vietnamese market ahead of them, and between the emotionally powerful lobby of families of US soldiers listed as missing in action during the Vietnam war. Former President George Bush had outlined a 'road map' towards normal relations with Vietnam. This paired progress on the missing in action issue with a step by step approach to the relaxation of US commercial sanctions.</p>

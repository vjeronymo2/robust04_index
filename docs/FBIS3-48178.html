			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Korea Herald correspondent Min Pyong-il] </F>   [Text] MACAO -- Macao circles are looking forward to  expansion of North Korean activities in the Portuguese enclave  in the remaining five years before China regains sovereignty  over Macao in 1999, a North Korean watcher here said.    Chokwang Trading Co. originally operated, paying what  amounted to only token rental charges, from one of the  properties of the late Ho Yin, perhaps the richest and most  influential pro-Beijing Chinese businessman in Macao, he  explained.    Following Ho Yin's death close to 10 years back, some of the  properties are being redeveloped and Chokwang will soon move to  a property that it had acquired in recent years, according to  business sources here.    "It is almost certain that the North Korean will continue to  use Chokwang as a bridge to the Western world after 1999," the  North Korean watcher said.    For years, there have been reports that Chokwang had been  active as the purchasing or selling agent for North Korea. Back  in the early 1970s, North Korea had requested to set up a shop  which was intended to act as an intelligence gathering agency in  Hong Kong, but the Hong Kong Government declined, he explained.    North Koreans were undaunted and set up a shop in a Chinese  name with personnel traveling either as Hong Kong citizens or  Chinese holding Chinese passports.    After their attempts in Hong Kong were thwarted, North Korea  finally set up a shop selling North Korean bric-a-brac on one of  the main roads in northern Macao, the source disclosed.    Later it was expanded and while the shop still functioned,  more North Koreans came and set up the Chokwang Trading on Ho  Yin's property, according to the watcher.    According to him, it had been a common joke that one of the  paramount duties of Chokwang was to buy luxury goods for the Kim  father and son, the son being particularly prone to a special  brand of Swiss chocolate.    North Korean watchers first sensed Kim Chong-il's absence  from public scene in the mid-1970s, when those involved in  monitoring chocolate shipments from Switzerland to North Korea  noticed that the shipments had suddenly ceased.    At one time, the business activities of Chokwang were so  robust that its staff multiplied -- from a mere 11 or 12 in 1975  to more than 100. After the series of terrorist accidents such  as KAL bombing and Rangoon assassination attempt, not to mention  the kidnapping of a popular Korean actress Choe Un-hui in Hong  Kong, the Macao authorities, using a newly promulgated law on  residency of aliens as a stick, restricted North Koreans'  presence here, according to him.    Mario Soares, the Portuguese president, visited Korea in  October last year and openly blasted North Korea while visiting  the truce village of Panmunjom. Before he flew into Seoul as  the first Portuguese president to have ever visited Korea, he  spent two days in Macao as part of his itinerary, which  culminated in a ceremony in Tokyo to mark the 450th anniversary  of Portuguese arrival in Japan.    North Korean watchers here said that Soares' outburst at  Pyongyang would not materially affect Chokwang's activities in  Macao.    Nevertheless, the Portuguese security agency appears to be  doubling its watch for any intelligence or subversive activities  by the North Koreans.    "As far as I know, not only is it closely watching Chokwang  but also keeping surveillance on all North Korean residents  here," he said.    Today, according to other sources, Chokwang has a permanent  staff of about 30. However, this does not necessarily mean its  activities have been curtailed, a North Korean watcher stressed.    It means only some annoying inconvenience for them as the  North Koreans who arrive in Macao for a day or two's visit now  have to go to the nearby Zhuhai Special Economic Zone only to  return the next day to continue their business, he concluded.</p>

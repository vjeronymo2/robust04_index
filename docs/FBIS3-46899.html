NODONG SINMUN today, commenting on that, says: The South  Korean warlikers incited confrontation and war from the  beginning of the year because they intend to continue to seek  confrontation, not national unity and reconciliation, and make  more vicious military adventures against the North on the ground  and the sea and in the sky this year.    The news analyst goes on:    It is ill-boding that the puppet military bosses of South  Korea dared let out bellicose outcries from the beginning of the  year.    What draws particular attention is that the South Korean  puppets cried for "maintenance of firm relations of military  cooperation" with the United States and "effective operation of  the quick deployment deterrent force."    Thus, they revealed their intention to commit more  undisguised criminal acts against fellow countrymen this year in  collusion with outside forces. The traitorous nature of Kim  Yong-sam hell-bent on doing harm to fellow countrymen in  conspiracy with outside forces far from working for  reunification through national reconciliation and unity has been  brought to light from the beginning of the year.    If the puppets persist in confrontation and war like a puppy  knowing no fear of a tiger, they will get nothing good.</p>

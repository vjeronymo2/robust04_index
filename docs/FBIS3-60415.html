"All the countries around Japan are AIDS countries," Ouchi  said.    "With the exception of Japan, the units that go on United  Nations peacekeeping operations from other countries all come  back infected with AIDS."    Ouchi, chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP),  made  the comments in response to questions from participants at a  seminar on party policy he attended at the invitation of the  prefectural branch of his party in Fukui.    Ouchi said he would not name countries, but added that "many  people are going overseas recently and AIDS is on the increase  especially among young women."    "Japan aims to be an advanced country when it comes to  medical treatment and we must conquer AIDS," Ouchi concluded.    One participant, who requested anonymity, said he thought  Ouchi's comments might have "gone too far as health minister."    On November 25, the ministry's AIDS surveillance committee  released its latest figures indicating that Japan had a total of  1,356 people who were either human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)  carriers or had developed AIDS symptoms.    The figure does not include people infected through blood  transfusions.</p>

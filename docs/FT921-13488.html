			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Photograph cheque-card scheme expanded ROYAL BANK of Scotland is to offer a further 70,000 customers the opportunity to have their photographs on their cheque-guarantee cards. The scheme, which is free to customers during the pilot stage, was launched in October for branch customers in Edinburgh, Glasgow, London and Manchester. So far more than 8,000 customers have applied for the photograph cards. The bank says that some people have opened accounts with the bank in order to obtain a card with their photograph on. Other banks have held out against introducing photograph cards, saying they would not be effective against card fraud, and that there would be practical problems in photographing millions of customers and ensuring that the picture was up to date. Mr Kenneth Baker, home secretary, is due to meet clearing banks in March to discuss combating card fraud, including the possible introduction of photographs.</p>

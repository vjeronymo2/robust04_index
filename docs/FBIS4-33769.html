			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, 12 Jun (DPA) --  The Fourth Ibero-American summit will condemn Haiti's de facto  regime because it is "one of the most unfortunate situations in  our community," Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin disclosed  today.    The Colombian foreign minister indicated that the topic is  not on the agenda of the chiefs of state, who will attend the  14-15 June meeting in Cartagena de Indians, but she said the  Haitian situation will be analyzed "for certain."    "We will condemn the de facto regime, and we will support  the  embargo policy and the economic measures that are directed at  having the current government open the doors to  constitutionality," Sanin said. [passage omitted]    Sanin indicated that she does not know whether the topic of  Cuba will also be addressed by the government leaders, although  she said that in these types of meetings diverse topics may be  debated. The foreign minister said that, since the previous  summits, it has been observed that changes have been introduced  by the Fidel Castro government, but she stressed that these are  insufficient modifications. "We have seen some reforms, but not  with the speed we would like. We respect Cuba's  self-determination, although I do not want to deny that it would  be very satisfactory for everyone if complete freedoms existed  in that country," she commented.

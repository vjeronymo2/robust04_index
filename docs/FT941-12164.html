			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Sailing to new markets - In the first of a series on exporting, Richard Gourlay looks at a DTI initiative which uses the skills of private-sector industrialists An increasingly competitive domestic market in the UK; a currency that some say is undervalued and therefore gives an international edge; trade barriers being dismantled in the nearest market - they all point one way, UK companies should be stepping up their exports to Europe, if not further afield. Yet, according to the Institute of Export, only 40,000 companies in the UK regularly export in any year, as measured by submissions of zero-rated VAT returns, and only double this number export on an occasional basis. Many companies, in fact, see exports as troublesome bolt-on activities. And those that have products addressing market niches abroad - and an ability to export - are often afraid to make the first step overseas, according to Ian Campbell, director-general of the institute. The Financial Times this week launches a series of articles addressing the issues exporters must confront. Today we look at a specific Department of Trade and Industry initiative led by industrialists seconded from the private sector who bring together potential exporters and companies in markets they know. Next week, we will look at how banks deal with exporters. Subsequent articles will include dealing with export credit insurance, getting paid, customs and VAT issues, appointing a distributor or agent, dealing with correspondent banks and hedging of foreign exchange risk, basic market research abroad, and the DTI's other export promotion schemes. We would also welcome readers' experiences on fax 071 873 3933. Two years ago Exchange Textiles of Manchester was fighting for business in a buyers' market against a background of weak demand; prices barely covered overheads. Richard Grubb, managing director, recognised that smaller textile manufacturers were dangerously dependent on the UK retail trade. 'I decided that for a company to be successful in the next 10 years it must have up to 50 per cent of sales in exports.' But like many smaller companies, Grubb had no experience of exporting. He identified a possible demand for his fashionable childrens' underwear in the US and Germany, but where should he start? Grubb says he was greatly helped by a new Department of Trade and Industry scheme called the Export Promoter Initiative, brainchild of Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary. Two years later - and only four months after Exchange Textiles shipped its first set of underwear - the company is heading for exports in its first year equal to a quarter of its total Pounds 1m turnover. And as long as he gets paid he says the profit margins achieved are significantly better than in the UK. Heseltine used the Conservative Party conference in 1992 to announce that 100 businessmen and women would be seconded from British industry to help the export effort. So far he has only convinced 64 large companies to donate the time - and the salaries - of experienced exporters to the scheme. But there are signs the initiative could provide the much-needed private-sector drive and market experience that have been lacking from the DTI's export promotion services. 'The initiative works because businessmen are working together with other businessmen, banging heads together in a way that civil servants cannot do,' says Greg Shenkman, an export promoter who headed merchant bank Kleinwort Benson's operation in Japan until last year. Each export promoter adopts a different approach in the country he or she focuses on. Shenkman's priority is to help companies which are already trying to export to Japan to establish a more effective presence. But, like other export promoters, he is also using his knowledge of the local market to sniff out potential market opportunities for which he then seeks suppliers in the UK. His fellow export promoter, Peter Bacon, who worked in Japan for five years with Philips, the electronics group, has a different approach. Initially, he is trying to encourage import substitution by getting Japanese companies that have recently arrived in the UK to increase their local purchases. Export Promoter differs from earlier DTI schemes in that it helps British companies make contact with the decision takers. To some extent Bacon should be pushing against an open door because of the yen's appreciation. But, 'purchasing centres are often controlled in Japan so it is difficult to get chosen as a supplier. We are targetting the (Japanese electronic manufacturers) in the UK with the biggest yen content and the biggest need to localise more'. The theory is that once initial contacts have been established, UK suppliers should have made the kind of contacts in Japan that can lead to direct exports. Bacon will be taking 10 companies to Japan in April and will be ensuring that all the Japanese electronic manufacturers in the UK are aware of the visit. Grubb's first contact was with Andrew Garcia, sales manager for Europe at Pilkington Glass until he became an export promoter after attending a DTI seminar on how to appoint a commercial agent. Grubb was advised to send samples and a company profile to UK embassies in Germany. But even after the commercial secretary in Berlin put him in touch with a suitable agent, he was still faced with a mountain of questions. He had regular meetings with Garcia about the handling of foreign exchange exposure, distribution, dealing with the agent and the demanding quality the German market required. Garcia was the first person he called after returning from Germany with his first Pounds 70,000 order and he says he will stay in touch with the DTI. 'From a standing start in Germany I couldn't believe we had this order and nor could he.'</p>

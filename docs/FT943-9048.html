			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / International Company News: Metallgesellschaft warns on issue Shares in Metallgesellschaft's dropped sharply yesterday after it had issued a stern warning on the risks for shareholders in a DM1.4bn (Dollars 890m) capital raising issue which is central to its survival plans. The subscription period for 5.6m new shares at DM250m will run from August 18 to September 1, the battered metals and engineering group announced yesterday. But at the official market close yesterday the shares were down DM16, or 7.7 per cent at DM190.50. Pointing out that the issue price was higher than the current market rate of around DM200 a share, the company said the success of restructuring measures under way could not be definitely guaranteed. The resumption of dividend payments could not be expected for the foreseeable future and investment in the shares carried an 'increased risk', it added in an official statement. The company said that although the future of the group could not be seen as conclusively assured, planned and partially implemented financial and restructuring measures were important prerequisites for the company's continuation. The statement also noted an impending legal action in the US in which Horsehead Resource Development is claiming Dollars 500m damages in a fraud suit posted against MG's BUS Berzelius. A further claim for the same amount by the sacked head of MG Refining and Marketing had no chance of success, according to advice from the group's US lawyers. Meanwhile, MG is continuing its efforts to negotiate its way out of long-term oil contracts in the US which brought the company to its knees at the turn of the year. For the near future, MG said group losses for the year to the end of September would be about the same as last year's DM2bn deficit, while 'noticeable' effects of measures already taken would be felt in the current, final quarter. Prospects for the remaining businesses, some of which are still to be disposed of, included further substantial losses at the BUS Berzelius environmental services business, which last year lost a net DM25m, according to yesterday's announcement. Lurgi, which was carrying restructuring costs, would also make a loss. Earnings at Lentjes would be lower than last year's DM19m, while profits would return to normal in the services businesses which were hit by extraordinary charges in the 1992-93 financial year.</p>

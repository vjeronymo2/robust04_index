			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / International Company News: Xerox unveils full-colour office copier XEROX, the US document-processing company, yesterday unveiled eight new products, including a machine which it claimed enabled businesses to print full-colour documents in their offices, rather than relying on outside print shops. Over the past two years Xerox has moved into the emerging market for full-colour printing. It uses digital technology, rather than the traditional light-lens method. Xerox said its 4700 printer was the first digital laser printer connected to an office computer network, and could be used to produce full-colour, assembled documents.</p>

			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Firm Yeltsin line offers little joy for west: Russia needs a stronger state, the president told deputies yesterday. John Lloyd assesses the new mood in Moscow President Boris Yeltsin, saying he mounted the podium before the parliamentary deputies 'with a special feeling', yesterday sought to define a task which could engage all political forces in a common effort - the strengthening of the Russian state. This was the theme of his 50-minute speech which, constitutionally, defines the bounds within which government should work. Long-awaited, once delayed, the speech was the first major utterance from the president since the December 12 elections gave extreme right and left parties a large share of the legislature. In choosing the need to strengthen the state as his central message, he stole some clothes from the new forces - at the cost of appearing harder on foreign policy and of sounding largely incoherent on economic policy. His proposition was that everyone would benefit from a stronger state: the citizens worried by crime; the reforms which needed regulation; even the former Soviet states which needed a strong Russia to 'guarantee their stability'. The process would be achieved on the basis of the new constitution - the one indisputable victor, he claimed, from the December elections it was approved by a majority of those voting, but only 33 per cent of the electorate). The tone never resorted to the promises of speedy improvement which marked his speeches over the past two years; instead, it was sombre, even pessimistic. He emphasised the unrestrained growth of a corrupt and inert bureaucracy; the lack of a market economy working within agreed rules; the ignoring of laws and civil behaviour; a 'new estrangement of the government from the people'. On economics he sounded most like the Yeltsin of old. He said again reform must continue, and deepen; that the struggle against inflation remained at the heart of his policy (and that he would even invoke constitutional presidential powers to bring it down - but did not define how). In a tone of exasperation - one of the few times his even, strong delivery showed some variation - he asked: 'What's stopping us making a brief outline of a range of strategic industries, highly competitive on the world market and socially significant for Russia - the more so since experts say this is not more than 10 per cent of Russian enterprises. It's just these plants to which we should give normal state aid in the next few years.' Mr Yeltsin wants some winners picked: that assumes he wants some losers lost. However, he was immediately at pains to reassure the deputies and the population that he is concerned about the consequences of reform. 'The task,' he said, 'is to find a sensible relationship between the speed of reform and of the social sacrifice for it.' He exhorted his ministers not to forget the poor for a minute, and said that while a range of industries and citizens must be supported, the tax burden must be cut back. On foreign policy - the subject Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky of the ultra-nationalist Liberal Democrats has most made his own - he was tough. A central passage called on the foreign ministry, already taking a much harder line than before, to stop making concessions to neighbouring states and the wider world. He said: 'We have a lot of evidence that our fellow countrymen are being discriminated against. Russia's duty, in deeds, not in words, is to put an end to these practices. If we are dealing with violations of legitimate rights of Russians, this is not the exclusive internal affair of some other country, but our own, exclusive, state affair.' This could be threatening and was meant to sound so. To move to 'deeds' could mean anything - from economic sanctions, to a refusal to move troops from the Baltics, to military action. It is not comforting that Mr Yeltsin describes as 'lacking resolve' a foreign minister who refers to 'ethnic cleansing' of Russians in the Baltics, and who suggested Russian troops stay there indefinitely. Finally, he was curt on Nato expansion: 'This is the path towards a new threat for Europe and the world. Russia is not a guest in Europe, but a full participant in the European community with an interest in its well being.' It is a speech which - in the aftermath of the Ames spy revelations in Washington, the anger Russia expressed over Nato's ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs and its action in springing to their defence - will produce little joy in the west. It is the programme of a man who is manoeuvring between political shoals, and who can no longer afford to expose his patriotic flank. The question is: how far does this go in practice?</p>

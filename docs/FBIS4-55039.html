			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vlad Pufu: "General Suceava Resigned From the </F> Customs Directorate"]    [Text] Sources at the Ministry of Finance have revealed to  our reporters that on 29 April Reserve General Ioan Suceava  stepped down from his office as deputy general director of the  General Customs Directorate and chief of the Directorate for  Customs Checking and Supervision.    In his resignation, which was addressed to Finance Minister  Florin Georgescu, General Suceava requested "the termination of  my employment beginning 15 April, on the basis of Article 29."    The recent conflict that broke out between the Ministry of  Interior and the General Customs Directorate is gaining  momentum. On 25 April Mihai Panzariu, general director of the  General Customs Directorate, advised General Suceava that he  should hand in his resignation before 1 May, our sources said.    "Mihai Panzariu has begun to purge his backyard of spies. As  you may know, the relations between the two were not exactly  amiable. It seems that now they managed to reveal some  irregularities by General Suceava, so that they could offer him  this solution as a more elegant way to leave his office," the  same sources asserted.</p>

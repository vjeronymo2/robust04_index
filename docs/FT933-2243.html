			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Why inflation is never slain Sir, It was a shade presumptuous of the financial secretary to the Treasury to declare the British economy 'inflation-free' ('Unions attack Dorrell inflation claim', September 15). Nemesis, judging by August's RPI figure, may already be on the march. The inflation dragon, of course, though occasionally worsted, is never slain. The war against it is unending and has to be re-fought continuously. The enemy is never more dangerous, moreover, than when it looks down and out. The start of a cyclical upswing is particularly critical. It is precisely then that, often unseen and unguarded, the seeds of a fresh inflationary boom, and its recessionary aftermath, are apt to be sown, keeping the whole familiar show on the road. Those who make light of a danger they are ostensibly determined to combat are like fighters with one arm tied behind their back. Walter Grey, 12 Arden Road, Finchley, London N3 3AN</p>

			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Observer: Own goal Brian Laudrup, the Danish national soccer star, probably had a wonderful future with Italian club, AC Milan. Note the past tense; in his first season with the club, Laudrup seems more intent on scoring points against Milan's chairman and owner - Silvio Berlusconi, rising force of Forza Italia, the Italian political party aiming to attract middle-class voters in Sunday's election. The Danish striker says Berlusconi wrongly mixes sport with politics: 'In other countries the presidents of football clubs are elected. Here in Italy they are more or less dictators. They do exactly what they want and take decisions over the heads of their trainers and managers.' But let's not be too beastly to Berlusconi, aka sua emittenza, or his transmittance. Based on Laudrup's description, the media tycoon doesn't sound any worse than many chairmen of British premier league sides.</p>

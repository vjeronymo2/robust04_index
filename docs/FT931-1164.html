			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Bemrose in Pounds 21m cash call to fund acquisition BEMROSE Corporation, the Derby-based security and promotional printer, yesterday announced a 1-for-2 rights issue at 265p to raise Pounds 21.1m. The proceeds will be used to fund the acquisition of the outstanding 50 per cent of a US joint venture company, Bemrose Yattendon, and reduce the borrowings of the enlarged group. The shares gained 17p to close at 343p yesterday. At the same time, the company announced the acquisition for Pounds 4m of Barnard and Jackson, a leading UK diary manufacturer based in north London, and reported a 24 per cent increase in 1992 pre-tax profits, helped by 'an excellent contribution from BYI.' Group pre-tax profits in the 53 weeks to January 2 increased to Pounds 6.26m (Pounds 5.06m), on turnover of Pounds 49.7m (Pounds 48.6m). Earnings per share advanced by 22 per cent to 24.28p (19.87p). The final dividend of 7.45p makes an unchanged 11.75p total for the year. Under the terms of the proposed US deal, Bemrose will pay Yattendon Investment Trust an initial Pounds 11m for the stake in BYI and make a deferred cash payment of Dollars 2.5m (Pounds 1.76m) a year later. In addition, Bemrose will consolidate BYI's net debt of Dollars 18.7m at the start of January. BYI is a holding company for three US businesses involved in the supply of promotional products to the US specialty advertising industry. The businesses are Souvenir, Renaissance and Janesville. Last year the group posted pre-tax profits of Dollars 5.81m (Dollars 3.37m) on turnover of Dollars 64.9m (Dollars 59.5m). Mr Rodger Booth, Bemrose's chief executive, said the acquisitions represented significant steps for the group. 'We are pleased to increase our ownership of BYI to 100 per cent as the recovery in the US specialty advertising industry is emerging.' He added that 'the acquisition of Barnard and Jackson will provide significant synergies when combined with our existing diary activities. Overall, prospects for the enlarged group in 1993 are encouraging.' The rights issue of 8.4m shares has been underwritten by SG Warburg.</p>

			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Greek government under fire: Ex-ministers joining the attack on pension reform GREECE'S conservative government, wrestling with the public sector unions over pension reform, has come under attack from a group of prominent ex-cabinet ministers opposed to its tough new economic policy. The dissidents claim they represent the ruling New Democracy party's social conscience. But their populist call for gentler handling of the economy, if heeded, could wreck Greek efforts to meet the Maastricht targets for European union. In August, Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis, after months of prevarication, finally gave the green light for launching painful reforms urged by the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund. A revenue package, including a 30 per cent increase in petrol prices, was followed by privatisation of the strike-plagued Athens bus company. The dismissal of 8,000 workers, the first large-scale purge of public sector workers for many years, set the stage for a decisive confrontation between government and the unions. The measures also provoked the populists in New Democracy, a party still dominated by old-fashioned patronage politicians, to step up their campaign to undermine the technocrats who have taken over at the economic ministries. Divisions in the party deepened as Mr Mitsotakis moved away from the populist faction - whose laissez faire approach to the economy influenced his first two years in office - to back Mr Stefanos Manos, the economy minister, and his energetic team drawn from outside the New Democracy ranks. The dissidents this week publicly criticised the new pension law being debated in Parliament. Although the legislation was approved in principle yesterday, both Mr Athanassios Kanellopoulos, former deputy prime minister, and Mr Antonis Samaras, former foreign minister, have said they will oppose several of its clauses. The political atmosphere is already highly charged after two weeks of strikes by workers in the power company, state-controlled banks, transport and telecommunications organisations which are crippling industry and disrupting everyday life. While the populists say they are as enthusiastic as anyone in Greece about European union, they appear reluctant to accept that only a radical overhaul of the pension system can have an impact on reducing the public-sector deficit and overall debt in accordance with Maastricht requirements. This year Greece will spend almost 15 per cent of the country's gross domestic product on pension outlays, the largest single item of government spending. The population is ageing faster than in any other EC country. The main pension funds, chronically short of contributions and often mismanaged, are sunk in debt. It is clear the government cannot afford to maintain the generous policies of the past, with many public-sector workers receiving pensions equivalent to 90 per cent of their salaries well before reaching their sixties. The new law, drafted with the help of advisers from the IMF, Britain and Germany, aims at gradually raising the retirement age to 65. Contributions will be increased, while new entrants to the workforce will have to accept that in future pensions will represent a much smaller percentage of salaries. However, strong unions like the electricity and bank workers, able in the past to secure extra wage increases and special benefits from the ruling party because of their power to bring the economy to a halt, are fiercely resisting reform. Moreover, Mr Andreas Papandreou, the opposition leader, has been quick to exploit the unions' challenge, calling on members of his Panhellenic Socialist Movement to take to the streets in support of the strikers. Despite his avowed support for Maastricht, Mr Papandreou has boosted the unions' cause by pledging to repeal the pensions law if he returns to power.</p>

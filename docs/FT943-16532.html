			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Arafat joins Rabin in strong defence of peace agreement Mr Yassir Arafat, Palestinian leader, and Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, united yesterday in strongly defending their peace agreement against its opponents on both sides of the Arab-Israeli divide. Mr Arafat, on the third day of his triumphant homecoming to the Gaza Strip, warned people not to heed opponents of the Palestinian-Israeli peace accord. 'Peace has many enemies and there are many attempts to sabotage and destroy the peace of the brave,' he said. 'This is why we are all requested to defend this peace because this peace is for all of us  - Israelis and Palestinians.' Mr Rabin echoed the PLO chairman's remarks and attacked rightwing demonstrators protesting against Mr Arafat's landmark visit to Gaza. He said he supported the Palestinian leader's homecoming and promised to strengthen the peace with Palestinians. 'The process will continue,' Mr Rabin said in a speech to members of his ruling Labour party after hundreds of Israeli protesters clashed with police in Jerusalem in a third day of rightwing demonstrations against the PLO leader's visit. 'We have an interest in strengthening the elements among the Palestinians who want the accord.' The joint defence of the peace process came as Mr Arafat plunged into the job of running the shattered Gaza Strip, forging ties with his impoverished people and pledging to expand Palestinian self-rule quickly from Gaza-Jericho across the rest of the West Bank. In Gaza City Mr Arafat sought to demonstrate his concern about the deep economic troubles facing the 850,000 mostly jobless residents of the strip, inaugurating a citrus juice factory funded by foreign aid. Mr Arafat made the visit after criticising international donors for the delay in releasing millions of dollars of promised assistance and described the situation in Gaza as close to 'starvation'. The veteran guerrilla turned peacemaker, who returned last Friday after 27 years in exile, also said he wanted Israel to pull its forces out of Palestinian towns in the West Bank by August. The PLO said Mr Arafat would visit Jericho tomorrow to swear in his 24-member national authority, or cabinet, and meet residents of the West Bank. The trip has been delayed by 24 hours, partly to make further security preparations. Dream of home shattered, Page 4 Editorial Comment and Observer, Page 19</p>

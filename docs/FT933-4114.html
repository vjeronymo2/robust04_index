			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Action against councils halted THE government is to take no further action against 15 local councils which ran up huge losses on their direct service organisations, it was announced yesterday. The threat of punitive action was withdrawn after all 15 took steps to abolish their direct service organisations or ensure they operated more efficiently. All 15 had notices served upon them in May or June as a result of financial losses by their direct services during 1991-92.</p>

			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Bribe allegations catch FA offside: A determination 'to keep football above the suspicion of corruption' The Football Association, the game's governing body in England, yesterday found itself in some difficulty over newspaper allegations that a player had been bribed to help 'throw' a game. Mr Michael Parry, its spokesman, said the incident was 'so isolated that we don't even have a mechanism at the FA to investigate it'. It is some time since the last such allegations. David 'Bronco' Layne and the England international Peter Swan were among 10 players jailed in 1965 for fixing games. The FA yesterday launched a 'thorough and urgent investigation' into the allegations centred on Bruce Grobbelaar, the Southampton goalkeeper who used to play for Liverpool. Mr Grobbelaar denied the allegations. The FA said The Sun newspaper, which made the allegations, had agreed to hand over information, including video tapes. The premier league, Southampton, Liverpool, and the Professional Footballers' Association have also pledged to co-operate with the inquiry. Mr Graham Kelly, FA chief executive, said: 'There is no suggestion that today's allegations are anything but an isolated case. We are determined to keep football above the suspicion of corruption in any form.' Mr Graham Sharpe of bookmakers William Hill, which takes Pounds 1m a week in football bets, said that if match-rigging did exist in Britain, 'it exists on a very, very minor scale'. The British game does have a seedy side. Mr Terry Venables, the England coach, spends a lot of time denying stories about his financial dealings. Mr Lou Macari, the former Swindon Town manager, was banned for a year for betting that his team would lose an important game. Most fans assume that what happens on British pitches is fair. They know it is hard to rig a football match - according to The Sun Mr Grobbelaar's teams won or drew games in which he allegedly let in soft goals. The only safe way to fix a match is to bribe the whole team. More than Pounds 1bn is bet on football each year but more than 80 per cent of that is on the pools, so anyone wanting to make money dishonestly would have to fix several matches. Fans trust players even though hundreds of thousands of pounds can rest on a big game and playing careers are short. A couple of blunders on the day would excite little surprise. Football is a closed world and it is easy to see why a footballer would not want to throw a game. From the age of 16, when he joins a professional club, football provides him with almost all his friends, his values and social status. Hardly anyone is criticised in public and if you are lucky you can stay in the game long after you retire. Germany, Belgium, France and Italy have all had scandals in the last two decades. In Italy gambling Mafiosi were arranging for players to throw matches. When the 'Toto Nero' was exposed in 1979 the Italian FA relegated AC Milan and banned a number of players, including Paolo Rossi, for three years. The German scandal also involved betting. But in Belgium in 1982, and in France last year, Standard Liege and Olympique Marseille respectively bribed opponents to guarantee winning the league title. In Russia two years ago managers of all first division clubs were asked whether match-rigging went on in their league. All said it did. But all replied no to the next question: 'Does your club play in these matches?'. The Sun's allegation is that Mr Grobbelaar was bribed by a syndicate from the Far East, where football is less honest. Mr Peter Velappan, secretary-general of the Asian Football Confederation, said: 'I was once quite shocked to receive a report about a youth team, all its members under 15, carting away TVs, video players, radios and stereo sets after losing 12-0 in an international youth competition.' The Grobbelaar case comes when football in Britain is enjoying a resurgence in popularity. If Britain does suffer a bribery case, that should change little. The sad thing is that football here could be starting to slip for other reasons. A cocaine scandal involving famous players is waiting to break. England's draw against Romania last month and Manchester United's 4-0 defeat at Barcelona last week make it clear that the 1960s are a long time ago. On the other hand, there are few Peter Swans and 'Bronco' Laynes any more.</p>

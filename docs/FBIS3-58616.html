			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Paris, Jan 17 (AFP) -- Education Minister Francois  Bayrou said Monday [17 January] he would not resign despite  calls for his ouster during a mammoth demonstration here Sunday  to protest his plan for unlimited financing of private schools  by local authorities.    "One does not serve as education minister if one cannot  handle a crisis. One should not be a sailor if one is seasick,"  he said in interview with the radio station Europe 1.    Bayrou said he did not think that the leftist-backed  demonstration, which drew hundreds of thousands of people from  all over France, signaled a resurgence of the leftist  opposition, which had seemed demoralized since its defeat at the  polls last March.    "One should not look at what happened yesterday in strictly  political terms," he noted. "We do not want this to become a  pretext for playing politics in order to revive a struggling  political party or politicians who are responsible for the  current state of French schools."    He also backed a proposal by Socialist Party Michel Rocard  to  convene a national forum on education.    Organisers said the demonstration drew more than one  million,  although police set the figure much lower. But the number of  participants seemed well in excess of the 350,000 originally  expected by organisers.    The demonstrators, many of whom arrived aboard dozens of  special trains and thousands of buses, waved banners calling for  the resignation of Education Minister Francois Bayrou, beat  drums, blew whistles and played bagpipes under grey skies and  drizzling rain.    The protest was called to denounce a reform of the financing  of private, mainly Catholic schools, adopted by parliament in  December and it drew on France's deeply ingrained anti-clerical  tradition on the left.    The new legislation was annulled Thursday as inegalitarian  by  the constitutional court, France's highest constitutional  authority.</p>

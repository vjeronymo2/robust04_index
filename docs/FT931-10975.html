			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Portuguese gas talks collapse TWO YEARS of negotiations on an Es103bn (Dollars 704m) project to pipe natural gas into Portugal have collapsed. The deadlock calls into question the Lisbon government's plan to introduce natural gas by 1995 as an alternative to coal and oil. Portugal is the only European Community country without a natural gas supply system. The collapse also leaves a question mark over a 900MW plant powered by natural gas and being constructed in Portugal by a Siemens-led consortium, and over plans for another, similar plant to be built by 2001. Also, plans to buy liquefied national gas (LNG) from Algeria will almost certainly be scrapped. The government called off talks between Natgas, an international consortium led by Gaz de France (GDP) and Electricidade de Portugal (EDP), Portugal's power company, after the two had failed to agree on prices and risk-sharing. 'We would rather have no deal than a bad deal,' Mr Luis Pereira, Portugal's energy secretary of state, said. He blamed GDF, saying it had expected EDP to take on exaggerated risks. It had insisted on too high a demand price for fixed costs and had undermined the talks by reviving already agreed questions close to negotiating deadlines. GDF refused to comment in detail yesterday, beyond stressing that it was up to Natgas to respond. 'Gaz de France, like all the partners, remains determined to bring off this project, which it estimates to be viable, if only the points in dispute can be overcome,' said the group. Natgas's largest shareholder is Gas de Portugal, the local gas distribution group, with 25 per cent, followed by GDF (23 per cent), Total (13 per cent), Ruhrgas (13 per cent), the Portuguese government (10 per cent), and two Portuguese companies with 8 per cent each. But GDF led the negotiations and was to be industrial operator, said an official of the French group. Lisbon is now studying alternatives. 'We are not giving up on natural gas,' said Mr Pereira. 'It is our alternative fuel for the future.'</p>

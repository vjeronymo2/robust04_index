			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Miras cut 'unlikely to hit home market' Any decision by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to reduce mortgage income tax relief would be unlikely to affect the housing market, Abbey National, the home loans and banking group, said. A survey for the group found that 87 per cent of people felt further changes in the relief would not affect their decision to move. Last year's Budgets included cuts in the rate of mortgage interest relief to 20 per cent from April this year, and to 15 per cent from April next year. It is expected that it will continue to be phased out.</p>

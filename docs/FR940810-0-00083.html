Section (e)(6) of the 1986 standard allowed ``small-scale, short-duration operations'' to be exempt from the negative pressure enclosure requirement for removal, demolition, and renovations operations. However, some contractors successfully argued in enforcement actions, that a NPE was a particularized kind of a ``regulated area'' which the overriding general provision required only in ``work areas where airborne concentrations of asbestos exceed or can reasonably be expected to exceed the TWA and/or excursion limit'' (Section (e)(1)). To impart certainty to the requirement OSHA issued a compliance directive which triggered the requirement at the PEL, and attempted to clarify the kind of operations which would qualify for the exemption, in a job where exceedances of the PEL were expected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In its July 20, 1990 proposal, OSHA would have required NPEs based on the type of work to be done; and sought to clarify the definition of small-scale, short duration operations by proposing specific cutoffs for ``small'' and ``short.'' In addition, general criteria were proposed which were intended to amplify the exemptive criteria: operations must be ``non-repetitive, affect small surfaces or volumes of material containing asbestos&blank;*&blank;*&blank;* not expected to expose bystanders to significant amounts of asbestos&blank;*&blank;*&blank;* completed within one work day.'' Cutoffs for specific operations were: repair or removal of asbestos on pipes: 21 linear feet; repair or removal of asbestos panel; 9 square feet: pipe valves containing asbestos gaskets or electrical work that disturbs asbestos: one worker, four hours, removal of drywall: one workday, endcapping of pipes and tile removal: four hours, and installation of conduits: eight-hour work shift.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many participants agreed that using only the duration, and size of a job did not adequately characterize risk. Some argued that all asbestos jobs were risky, indeed there should be little regulatory distinction made. For example, NIOSH spokesperson, Richard Lemen, expressed the view that ``even with short duration, small-term jobs we still feel that there is a risk to the worker, not only from the one time exposures, but from the potential of that worker doing multiple jobs over periods of time&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;which increase the exposure each time and the lung burden of asbestos to each of those exposures&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;we still feel that&blank;*&blank;*&blank;* [these jobs] should be treated as protectively as the other type of jobs.'' (Tr. 244), [See to the same effect the testimony of Mr. Cook, an abatement contractor who testified for the BCTD and Lynn McDonald, representing the Sheet-Metal Workers Union, (Tr. 829ff)].  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed definition of small-scale, short duration operations included specification of the number of square and linear feet of asbestos-containing material. There were numerous objections raised to the proposed values.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several participants suggested that the NESHAP cutoff of 260 square or 160 linear feet, used by EPA for notification, be used as the cutoff for small-scale work (Ex. 7&hyph;9, 7&hyph;21, 7&hyph;39, 7&hyph;52, 7&hyph;113, 103, 1&hyph;53, 1&hyph;55). Others such as Edward Palagyi, a Florida State Asbestos Coordinator, felt that this cutoff was too high for OSHA to use in its definition (Ex. 7&hyph;6).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

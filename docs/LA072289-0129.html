			<p><P> July 22, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FOR TIGERS, GOOD INNING ISN'T ENOUGH  </P> <P> For an inning at least, the Detroit Tigers snapped out of their woeful hitting  and knocked the Angels' pitching silly Friday night at Anaheim Stadium.  </P> <P> The game took a decided turn for the worse for the Angels in the fourth inning,  though they eventually rallied for an 8-7 victory on Wally Joyner's two-run  homer in the ninth.  </P> <P> It's possible to be more specific, but the hits in that fourth inning all  seemed to blur together.  </P> <P> Entering the inning, the Angels led, 4-2. But two singles, three doubles and  nine batters later, the lead had disappeared as had starter Mike Witt, who left  after 3 2/3 innings.  </P> <P> Witt was shaky from the start, allowing runs in the first two innings. But in  the third, he retired the Tigers in order.  </P> <P> Then the nightmarish fourth began.  </P> <P> Keith Moreland started the inning with a single to right field.  </P> <P> Chet Lemon, a lifetime .429 hitter against Witt but just a .250 hitter against  the rest of the league this season, forced Moreland. After Doug Strange flied  out, it all unraveled for Witt.  </P> <P> Gary Pettis, fresh off a four-strikeout performance Thursday night, singled  through Witt's legs and into center field. It was the second hit of the night  for Pettis, who came into the game hitting .232 with three RBIs and one home  run.  </P> <P> Lemon raced around to third on Pettis' single.  </P> <P> Up stepped Mike Heath, who lined a double down the right-field line that scored  Lemon and Pettis.  </P> <P> Tigers 4, Angels 4.  </P> <P> Dave Bergman placed a sinking liner just inside the right-field line for a  double to score Heath.  </P> <P> Tigers 5, Angels 4.  </P> <P> Next up was Tracy Jones, who, just to be different doubled down the left-field  line, scoring Bergman.  </P> <P> Tigers 6, Angels 4.  </P> <P> Three doubles and you're out was the way pitching coach Marcel Lachemann  figured and he took Witt out of the game and replaced him with Rich Monteleone  at that point.  </P> <P> Monteleone watched as Jones took third base on Lance Parrish's passed ball.  Then, he turned around and walked Lou Whitaker.  </P> <P> Next came Alan Trammell, the ninth batter in the inning. Trammell hit a sharp  line drive, but it was right at second baseman Johnny Ray, who caught it for  the third out.  </P> <P> Four runs on five hits.  </P> <P> Not a bad showing for a team that ranks last in the American League in hitting.  The Tigers came into the game with a paltry .242 team batting average.  </P> <P> Only Moreland, who's hitting .313, is above .300. The next highest is Jones  with a .283 average.  </P> <P> Whitaker, who hit his 20th home run of the season in the ninth inning, is the  lone Tiger among AL leaders.  </P> <P> To make matters worse, catcher Matt Nokes, who is one of the few power-hitters  on the Tiger roster, is on the disabled list with an injured knee suffered when  Chili Davis collided with him in June.  </P> <P> It's no wonder the Tigers are in last place in the AL East and have the worst  record (33-60) in the majors.  </P> <P> They've been there since June 7 and don't appear to be capable of moving out of  there anytime soon.  </P> <P> But for an inning Friday, they seemed to put it all together.  </P></p>

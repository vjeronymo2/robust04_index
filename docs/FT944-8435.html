			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Investing for Income): Risks, but sterling qualities, too - Bonds that offer wider choice than gilts and can produce unusually good value Nobody should invest in anything they cannot understand. So, personal investors who find gilt-edged stocks difficult will be right to steer clear of sterling bonds - unless they have a reliable adviser. These bonds, issued by UK companies, offer an even wider choice than gilts and usually provide slightly higher returns. This is reasonable, since the repayment guarantee from issuers is not as solid as the UK government guarantee behind gilts. But investors willing to take on that additional credit risk can often get the slightly higher returns without penalty. And, as in all markets, particular corners of that in sterling bonds sometimes offer unusually good value. A slightly speculative case in point is preference shares. These are conventionally assessed and traded as if they were bonds but they are, as the name suggests, shares. This means that - like ordinary shares - they pay dividends, not interest, and they pay their dividends net but with a tax credit. The gist of the argument is this. Back in the summer, there was a scare that the Budget to be introduced on Tuesday, November 29, might reduce the dividend tax credit. If this were to happen, investing institutions which are not liable to income tax, such as pension funds, would see a reduction in income. Normally, they can claim back the tax but, if the credit were reduced, there would be less tax to reclaim. So, the gross dividend they received would be reduced, too, and the gross yield along with it - and prices would fall. Predictably, the result of the scare was that prices of preference shares weakened, even though nothing had yet happened. Securities firm BZW puts forward two reasons why preference shares are attractive to taxpayers such as personal investors interested in income. First, shareholders who do pay income tax would not be affected adversely even if the tax credit were cut: they would continue to get the same net yield. Second, BZW no longer expects the tax credit to be tampered with in the Budget: hence its suggestion that, if it is right, prices of preference shares will rise to eliminate the present anomaly. At the moment, a couple of insurance company prefs (Commercial Union 8.375 per cent and General Accident 7.875 per cent) offer yields of 6.5 per cent net to the 40 per cent taxpayer, compared with 6.2 per cent from the broadly comparable Halifax permanent interest-bearing share (Pibs) and 5 per cent from the relevant gilt. Preference shares and Pibs are mainly of interest to income-orientated investors prepared to keep their money invested 'for ever' and willing to accept the enduring capital risk. So, the hope of a price rise is a bit of a red herring. One snag with preference shares is that most issues are small and the shares may be difficult to buy and sell. But the two large insurance companies, GA and CU, and some high street banks including NatWest, have issues of Pounds 100m or more. Private investors should stick to these. The preference share yields mentioned above are equivalent to a gross yield of 10.9 per cent, roughly two points better than the fixed deposit rates shown on page 10. Neither is 'better': they suit different types of investors who have different attitudes to risk and different time horizons.</p>

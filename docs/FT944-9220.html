			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / International Company News: Yamaha Corp rises 110% at halfway Yamaha Corp, the world's largest maker of musical instruments and the leader of Japan's Yamaha group of companies, yesterday announced a 110 per cent rise in its unconsolidated recurring profits - before extraordinary items and tax - to Y6.15bn (Dollars 63.4m) for the six months to September, from Y2.92bn a year ago, writes Our Financial Staff in London. Net profits rose 149 per cent to Y3.05bn from Y1.22bn last time, as sales edged up 2.8 per cent to Y176.95bn from Y172.14bn. The dividend is held at Y3 per share. Yamaha said its higher recurring profits resulted from both increased sales and its restructuring efforts. For the full year to March, it forecasts recurring profits of Y4bn, up 83 per cent on last year's Y2.19bn, and net profits 237 per cent higher at Y2bn, against Y593m, on expected sales up 4 per cent to Y330bn from Y316.18bn.</p>

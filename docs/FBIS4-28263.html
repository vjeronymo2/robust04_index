			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 3 KYODO -- A friendship promotion  association led by Ichiro Ozawa, the chief strategist of the  ruling coalition which reportedly received 100 million yen from  the construction industry in 1991, also received donations from  other industries totaling 560 million yen, association sources  said Friday [3 June].    Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party],  reportedly used his influence to secure contributions from  automotive, electronics, banking and other industries for the  "John Manjiro no kai," a nonprofit group to promote Japan-U.S.  grassroots relations, the sources said.    The friendship organization was established in November  1990,  when Ozawa was then secretary general of the Liberal Democratic  Party and sought donations from businesses to host a November  1991 conference in Kyoto to promote Japan-U.S. exchanges.    Sadao Hirano, a Shinseito member of the House of  Councillors,  a close associate of Ozawa, was the acting chairman of the  organization and reportedly asked the Federation of Economic  Organizations (Keidanren) in September 1991 for its assistance  in reaching a donations goal of 600 million yen.    Hirano said Keidanren Secretary General Masaya Miyoshi spoke  with the industries that could not contribute money through  Keidanren, calling him "very cooperative."    On Thursday, the sources said the "John Manjiro no kai"  received 100 million yen from the Japan Federation of  Construction Contractors (Nikkenren), which is an influential  group in the Keidanren.    John Manjiro was a fisherman from old Tosa Province who was  shipwrecked in 1841 and taken to the United States by an  American whaling ship.    Manjiro later returned to Japan where he served as a  translator, wrote an English phrase book and taught at the  predecessor of Tokyo University as Japan opened to the world.</p>

			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COOK IT LIGHT: A JAZZED-UP VERSION OF RICE PUDDING  </P> <P> This is an unusual recipe for rice pudding. It actually started out as a  revision of a recipe sent to me by a reader from Eugene, Ore.  </P> <P> I found her recipe a bit bland, and by the time I got through with it I could  no longer call it a revision of her original recipe.  </P> <P> However, I now like it so much I want to share it. Try serving it with fresh  fruit for a touch of color. It's a delightful finish for a summer meal.  </P> <P> ALMOND RICE PUDDING  </P> <P> 1/2 cup chopped raw almonds  </P> <P> 1 1/2 cups nonfat milk  </P> <P> 1 1/2 cups water  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 1/2 cup long-grain brown rice  </P> <P> 1 envelope unflavored gelatin  </P> <P> 1/4 cup cold water  </P> <P> 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla  </P> <P> 1/2 cup sugar  </P> <P> 1 1/2 cups canned skimmed evaporated milk, well-chilled  </P> <P> Toast almonds in 350-degree oven 8 to 10 minutes until golden brown. Combine  nonfat milk, water and salt in heavy saucepan. Bring to boil over medium heat.  Slowly add rice, stirring constantly 2 minutes. Reduce heat to very low and  cook, covered, 1 hour, stirring occasionally.  </P> <P> Soften gelatin in cold water and add to hot rice mixture. Stir until completely  dissolved. Add vanilla and 1/4 cup sugar. Mix well and set aside to cool.  </P> <P> Place very cold evaporated milk in cold mixing bowl and beat until soft peaks  form. Slowly beat in remaining sugar. Fold whipped milk and toasted almonds  into cooled rice mixture and chill until firm, at least 3 hours. Serve with  fresh fruit. Makes 10 cups.  </P> <P> Each half-cup serving contains approximately 83 calories; 1 mg cholesterol; 2  gm fat; 63 mg sodium.  </P></p>

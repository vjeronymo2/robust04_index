			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Trade union raids Paris bourse The Paris bourse yesterday fell victim to a market raid - French style. Hundreds of trade unionists invaded the bourse headquarters in the grand Palais Brongniart building, forcing the suspension of trading in the financial futures pits. The invaders, from the communist-led union, the Confederation Generale du Travail, were protesting against the government's privatisation programme. In particular, they demanded the cancellation of the planned sale of shares in Renault, the state-owned automobile group and a symbol of French union power. 'We are targeting the bourse because it is the den of capitalism,' said Mr Joel Biard, the CGT's general secretary for the Paris area. He argued that privatisations would destroy jobs. The high-profile move is the latest attempt by the CGT and the Communist Party to derail privatisation plans. Their dwindling influence, however, means they have found little success. A call for Renault workers to down tools last month in protest at privatisation plans mustered little support. On Wednesday night, Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, confirmed that just over 30 per cent of Renault's shares would be floated by the end of the year. The CGT wielded more disruption within the bourse. Pit trading in Monep stock options and futures contract on the CAC-40 index of leading shares stopped. Screens were plastered with stickers, with anti-privatisation slogans, while unionists traded places with brokers in the seats behind the banks of terminals. A lone broker from Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, continued to trade by telephone, while a colleague was resigned. 'We have seen this before. Two years ago it was a protest against job cuts at Peugeot. Before that it was the farmers,' he said. A spokesman for the bourse said futures trading was continuing by telephone, and the impact of the disruption would be limited. Shares, which are traded by an electronic system, were unaffected. The unionists were undeterred. 'We are here to make a point. We will stay until we have made it. That could be days.' In the event it was hours. By 2pm, the CGT had withdrawn, hoping their point had been made.</p>

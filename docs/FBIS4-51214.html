			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Xiao Longlian (5135 7893 5114): "Xie Shijie on </F> Opening Up Before Official Visit to the United States"]    [Text] Chengdu, 22 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--At the  invitation of Washington State Governor Mr. Mike Lowry, Xie  Shijie, senior adviser to the Sichuan Provincial People's  Government, today left China for a friendly visit to Washington  State, Michigan, New York City, and Los Angeles, where he will  negotiate cooperation projects. Before he left, Xie Shijie  granted a special interview to the reporters from this news  agency.    "Expanding opening up to the outside world is Sichuan  Province's top priority this year, and my trip to the United  States this time is mainly to enhance understanding, foster  friendship, seek extensive contacts with the people from all  walks of life in the United States, and expedite Sichuan's  opening up to the outside world." Xie Shijie came directly to  the purpose of his trip to the United States.    Xie Shijie said that Sichuan Province established friendly  province-state relations with Washington State and Michigan in  October and November 1982 respectively. In the past 12 years,  Sichuan Province's friendship and cooperation with the two  states has continuously strengthened. During the trip this  time, discussions will be carried out with Washington State on  further strengthening economic and scientific cooperation, and  on developing friendly province-state relations, with Boeing  Company and some electronic companies, on agricultural  cooperation between the province and the state, and on food  processing, exchange of fine seeds for farming, and exchange of  technology of low-toxic pesticides; ideas will be exchanged on  strengthening thorough cooperation between the medium and small  cities in Washington State and in Sichuan Province; discussions  will be carried out with the Washington State Zoo on  establishing a foundation for protection of the giant pandas and  launching cooperation to rescue this endangered species.    Xie Shijie said that while in Michigan, he will visit the  General Motors Company, and carry out discussions with the state  government on the automobile industry, processing of farm  products, and transformation of old towns.    The humble and pragmatic Xie Shijie has worked in the  Sichuan  Provincial People's Government for many years, serving as vice  governor and executive vice governor; in April 1993, he began to  serve as party secretary of Sichuan Province, overseeing overall  work in Sichuan Province.    Talking about the major measures to expand Sichuan's opening  up this year, he said that Sichuan Province is situated in the  interior and has a vast area and 110 million people, 10 percent  of China's population; this is a huge market, and the potential  of this huge market is recognized by knowledgeable persons at  home and abroad. Sichuan Province's chemical, electronic, and  metallurgical industries rank first in China; Sichuan's space  technology is famous at home and overseas; and its abundant farm  products and cheap labor resource are also a strong point when  Sichuan opens up to the outside world.    Xie Shijie said: The basic way to expedite Sichuan's  economic development and narrow the difference between it and  the coastal provinces and cities rests on reform and opening up.  In order to increase the weight of Sichuan's opening up to the  outside world, beginning in Chengdu on 28 June this year, an  international conference on Sichuan's opening up to the outside  world plus an investment forum will be held, and during that  period, 306 projects involving a total investment of $13 billion  will be offered for negotiations with foreign businessmen. In  addition, a number of measures to expand opening up to the  outside world, including the transfer of rights to use  Chengdu-Chongqing Highway and the right to use state-owned  enterprises, will be promulgated one by one.    Coming to this point, Xie Shijie said that American  consortia, bankers, and entrepreneurs are welcome in Chengdu to  participate in the international conference on Sichuan's opening  up to the outside world plus the investment forum.    While in New York, Xie Shijie will also have contacts with  the persons of American financial and securities circles, hold  talks with the Sino-U.S. Trade Commission, and inspect  development of Sichuan's enterprises in New York. When in Los  Angeles, talks will be held with American entrepreneurs...    According to information, the number of American investors  coming to Sichuan has continuously increased, for example, the  Mcgill Group and the American Concord Group in Chengdu, and the  plating membrane production line under construction in Shuangliu  County--the largest in western China--as well as a  pharmaceutical factory in Guanghan.</p>

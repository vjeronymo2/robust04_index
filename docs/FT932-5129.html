			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Final moves on Daf buy-out expected soon A MANAGEMENT buy-out team from the Leyland Daf truck assembly plant at Leyland, Lancashire, has reached agreement 'on all outstanding commercial matters' with the administrative receivers to take over the UK operation. The deal, expected to be finalised next week, is the most important step in the rescue of the failed Dutch-owned Leyland Daf plant which collapsed into receivership at the beginning of February. The buy-out will secure about 700 jobs and opens the way for the rescue of other parts of the former Leyland Daf business, including the Albion axle plant in Glasgow, and the Leyland Daf spare parts operation at Chorley, Lancashire, now trading under the Multipart brand name. The buy-out team is being backed with Pounds 5m of equity capital by Barclays Development Capital. As part of the deal the Leyland site is to be acquired by Lancashire Enterprises, the development arm of Lancashire County Council. The buy-out team will purchase the immediate site of the assembly plant. Mr John Talbot and Mr Murdoch McKillop, joint administrative receivers with Arthur Andersen, said they were in the process of completing an agreement with Daf Trucks of the Netherlands to take over the former Leyland Daf sales and marketing operation based in Thame, Oxfordshire. Daf Trucks, the new company formed earlier this year to take over the core medium and heavy duty truck operations of the old Netherlands and Belgian Daf group, will now market the UK-built Leyland Daf light trucks in the UK and continental Europe.</p>

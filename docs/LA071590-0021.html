			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> HANDMADE;  </P> <P> PHOTOGRAPHS IN OLD-FASHIONED COLOR  </P> <P> TINTING, AS SOME of us may remember, was the process by which color was added  to black-and-white photos before Eastman Kodak came up with Kodachrome film in  1935. "Tinting is a dying art, but it's beginning to take hold again," says  Marita Penner, who has been bringing new life to black-and-white photos.  </P> <P> Whether it's just the T-shirt or perhaps the tennis shoes in a photograph,  Penner manages to put her paintbrush on the particular details that will make  or break a photo. She shoots in old-fashioned black and white -- which, she  explains, won't fade the way color photographs eventually will -- and then  hand-tints a few highlights with photo oils. The result is a smashing art photo  in old-fashioned color.  </P> <P> Penner's exhibit at arts-and-crafts fairs is a popular one, and a number of her  shots are longtime big sellers. (Her gallery-mounted, 11x14-inch photos in  16x20-inch frames sell for $75 each.)  </P> <P> Penner also makes house calls; she will go to clients' homes to shoot  children's portraits. For a $34 fee, plus traveling expenses, she provides one  8x10 photo, two 5x7s, three 3x5s and 12 wallet-size snapshots (all but the  wallet pictures bear her trademark tints).  </P> <P>  Marita Penner, Penner Enterprises, 17510 Hayes Ave., Lake Elsinore; (714)  678-4718.  </P> <P> LORETTA K.

			<p><P> June 10, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MAXWELL LABORATORIES CAN EXPECT MORE UNINVITED BIDS  </P> <P> Maxwell Laboratories' rejection of JAYCOR's uninvited $17-per-share merger bid  probably opened the door to more bids for the San Diego-based company that  develops high-tech products for military and commercial markets, industry  analysts said Friday.  </P> <P> Maxwell's board of directors Thursday rejected JAYCOR's $17 cash bid as  "inadequate and otherwise on unacceptable terms and not in the best interests  of the stockholders and the company." Maxwell closed up $1.25 at $15.75 Friday.  It reported a $14.20-a-share book value on April 30.  </P> <P> Analysts suggested that shareholder pressure would force Maxwell's board to  seriously consider a bid of $20 a share or above, and those analysts seemed  confident that more bids are likely.  </P> <P> "Once the genie is out of the bottle, there are always more bids," said Larry  Selwitz, a Newport Beach-based industry analyst with Cruttenden &amp; Co., who  suggested that Maxwell's board would have to "seriously consider" a bid of $20  or more a share.  </P> <P> "In Wall Street jargon, the company is now 'in play,' " according to Irving  Katz, director of research for Thomas Green/San Diego Securities. "The question  is whether (Maxwell's board) . . . can reject someone who comes in with a  respectable offer."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pulsed-Power Equipment  </P> <P> Maxwell designs, develops and manufactures pulsed-power equipment and performs  research and computer-based analysis for defense, energy, industrial and  environmental markets. Maxwell reported $1.3 million in net income and $29.3  million in sales for the six-month period ended Jan. 31. Its order backlog on  Jan. 31 was $109 million.  </P> <P> In November, Maxwell announced the formation of FoodCo, a majority-owned  subsidiary that boasts three multibillion-dollar corporations as  minority-interest partners. The highly secretive operation is believed to be  using Maxwell's pulsed-power technology for food-processing and food-packaging  applications.  </P> <P> JAYCOR Vice President E.S. Hamilton on Friday declined to comment on his  company's bid for Maxwell.  </P> <P> JAYCOR, a privately held, San Diego-based defense contractor, reported about  $65 million in 1988 revenue. JAYCOR provides scientific and engineering support  services, largely to military customers, Hamilton said.  </P> <P> About 150 of its 800 employees are in San Diego. Nearly 500 employees work in  the Washington area and the rest work at smaller offices around the country.  JAYCOR, which was founded in 1975, is principally owned by its employees and  ex-employees, Hamilton said.  </P> <P> Maxwell Vice President Sean M. Maloy on Friday said that JAYCOR's bid  conflicted with the company's "aggressive growth strategy," which includes the  possible acquisition of other companies. Being acquired now would disrupt that  strategy, Maloy said.  </P> <P> Maxwell, a publicly traded company, in recent years has added several  anti-takeover defenses. It adopted a fair-price provision that forces possible  suitors to negotiate a takeover with its board of directors. Maxwell also  staggered the terms of its board members, which could make it more difficult  for a hostile suitor to gain control of the company.  </P> <P> Still, Selwitz maintained that Maxwell is ripe for a merger or an acquisition  because "management has less than 10% of outstanding shares, the stock has been  selling  </P> <P> at below book value, and it's a company that's on the leading edge of its  technology. . . . I see some awesome potential in the military and commercial  arenas."  </P> <P> Katz suggested that Maxwell's board "could easily have rejected JAYCOR's  initial bid because "nobody really knows much about (JAYCOR), there's no  indication that they've tried to accumulate Maxwell stock, and you don't even  know if they could arrange financing to carry it off."  </P> <P> However, "Maxwell's next shareholder meeting will look like some kind of  embassy riot if they turn down something above $20 a share," Selwitz said.  </P> <P> Maxwell is a leader in the development of pulsed-power devices that have the  potential to be used in many military and commercial products. Maxwell, for  example, has used government contracts to research high-energy pulsed-power  systems that may one day be used to fire armor-piercing shells or power space  rockets.  </P> <P> The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency has awarded Maxwell a contract to use  its pulsed-power technology to evaluate the content of hazardous waste.  </P> <P> Late last year, Maxwell won a $20-million contract from Louisiana State  University to build a massive X-ray light source that will be used to design  and build ultra-high-density microelectronic devices.  </P></p>

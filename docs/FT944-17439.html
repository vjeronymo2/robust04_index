			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Japan's trade surplus falls Japan yesterday reported a 15.7 per cent decline in the current account surplus in the year to August, the first drop in three months. The improvement, hot on the heels of last weekend's settlement of the latest US-Japan trade row, reinforces the finance ministry's contention that the surplus is passing its peak. The drop, to Dollars 6.16bn from Dollars 7.31bn in the same month last year, comes partly as a result of a surge in energy imports caused by an unusually hot summer, plus an underlying pick-up in consumer demand. It is becoming clearer that Japan is heading for economic recovery, Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, said yesterday. Within the overall current account gap, the manufacturing trade surplus fell by 4 per cent to Dollars 8.65bn, while trade in services showed a Dollars 1.57bn deficit, 39 per cent more than the services deficit in August last year. Exports of goods rose by 12.2 per cent to Dollars 30.39bn, while imports grew rather faster, by 20.3 per cent to Dollars 21.74bn. A recent sharp rise in the outflow of long term capital continued in August, at Dollars 15.97bn, well over twice the Dollars 6.8bn capital outflow in the same month of last year. This is mainly due to an increase in Euro-yen bonds issued overseas by Japanese companies, in search of cheaper capital in less regulated foreign markets. Sales by foreign investors of Japanese shares and bonds held in Tokyo played a smaller part in August's capital outflow than was the case in July. Yesterday's fall in the surplus helped to ease pressure on the yen, so that the dollar rose Y0.47 to close at Y100.02 in Tokyo yesterday, the highest since September 1.</p>

			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Depressed demand and competition mean losses for Hi-Tec DEPRESSED consumer spending and severe competition from US rivals led to an interim loss at Hi-Tec Sports, the designer and marketer of sports shoes and leisure wear. The pre-tax loss was Pounds 2.84m in the six months to July 31, a downturn from a Pounds 3.74m profit. The UK was worst affected, recording an operating deficit of Pounds 900,000 compared to a Pounds 4.2m profit. Losses per share were 4.86p (earnings 6.67p) and the interim dividend is cut to 1p (1.65p). The shares fell 7p to 41p. Mr Ashley Reynolds, group services director, described the results as 'extremely disappointing'. He said Hi-Tec would be profitable in the second half, although it was too early to say if the first half losses would be eliminated. Markets had been hit by oversupply of leading brands following optimistic ordering last year. The situation was made worse by price cutting by US manufacturers, who shifted excess stock to the UK. Hi-Tec had to cut gross margins by an average 10 per cent. Turnover fell to Pounds 45.9m (Pounds 64.3m). North America was the only region to increase sales, up 19 per cent to Pounds 11.9m, helped by strong sales of outdoor footwear. Continental Europe reported an operating loss of Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 100,000 profit) mainly because of seasonal reasons with the 'Bad Boys' brand in the Netherlands. Mr Reynolds said the second half would be much stronger. Interest costs were contained to Pounds 977,000 (Pounds 1.34m) helped by the proceeds of a Pounds 10.3m rights issue in February. Net borrowings fell Pounds 13.6m to Pounds 18.5m, giving gearing of 50 per cent. COMMENT With these figures Hi-Tec has achieved its goal of reducing the proportion of UK profits, but not with the style or smoothness it hoped for. Although the reasons for the poor UK performance are compelling, they merely highlight how vulnerable smaller players like Hi-Tec can be when the US majors go for volume. The other problem, consumer confidence, is unlikely to improve quickly, either, and the UK - which last year supplied 60 per cent of operating profits - is likely to record a loss for the full year. There are brighter spots in the US and the Netherlands, for example, but full year forecasts are now for no better than break even. Shareholders who subscribed for the rights at 150p have already lost more than two thirds of their investment. Until there are more signs of recovery in core businesses, or outstanding growth in the peripheries, those losses will be hard to recoup.</p>

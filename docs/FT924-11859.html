			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Gatt hopes sink into electoral morass THERE were conflicting claims yesterday on whether talks between the EC and US to get a breakthrough on the Uruguay Round were still on - as the community argued - or off - as the Americans claimed. But there is little doubt that the world trade liberalisation negotiations stood last night on the brink of collapse. On Monday night, US negotiators said the negotiations had reached a dead end. They accused the EC of reopening arguments over cereals and cereal substitutes trade which the Americans thought had been settled. This further poisoned the separate bilateral dispute over the EC's oilseeds subsidy regime. Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner, was last night due to telephone US agriculture secretary Mr Ed Madigan, just before senior US officials met to decide whether to activate Dollars 1bn in punitive tariffs on EC food exports, because of the oilseeds row. Mr MacSharry was expected to clarify the EC's bottom line, in the hope of staving off a trade war and salvaging the Uruguay Round. If the US introduced the sanctions, 'we will have no alternative but to counter-retaliate,' Mr MacSharry said. Senior Commission officials claimed the US was trying to exert pressure by negotiating through the media. US officials accuse the commission of backtracking under French pressure to conserve its lucrative food exports, and German pressure to keep out cheap US cereals substitutes. 'They know that we know that they have a deadline,' an EC official said, referring to President George Bush's hope for a Gatt deal to boost his chances of re-election. There are political issues for the French too. The Socialist government faces defeat in next spring's elections. Under pressure from its farmers, it is retreating from its commitments under May's reform of the Common Agricultural Policy. The reforms entail cuts in farm prices and output which enable the EC to make farm trade cuts within Gatt. The US says it has no further room for manoeuvre on the oilseeds dispute. The Gatt has twice ruled against the EC oilseed subsidy regime, and pressure from powerful US soya producers and trade lobbies mounted as a deal on farm trade got nearer last week. Yet only half-a-million tonnes of soya appear to separate the two sides. Washington wants EC oilseed output cut to 9m tonnes a year. The EC says CAP reform, reducing the area sown with oilseeds, would yield a 9.5m tonne crop. 'We can't do any more than that without opening up the CAP reform; they're playing into the hands of the French,' one EC official said. On subsidised exports, the Gatt prescribes a 24 per cent cut in volume. The US offered 22 per cent. The EC wants flexibility between product sectors, or 'swings'. That way it could sell, say, more wheat if it sold less barley, as long as the uniform figure for both was met over six years. It has offered: a 24 per cent cut with 10 per cent 'swings' in each sector; a 21 per cent cut with 4 per cent swings; or a straight, no frills 18 per cent cut. All three formulas deliver less than 22 per cent. But negotiations were progressing until the commission, under German as well as French pressure, reaffirmed its need for 'rebalancing' - some EC protection against cheap US cereal substitutes such as corn gluten feed. Breaking this impasse now appears to depend on whether the commission can hold the French to their CAP undertakings, and get full-blooded support from EC leaders. Brussels will also have to work out some formula on oilseeds which will safeguard the EC's farm reform and relieve some pressure on Mr Bush. Otherwise the chance to reform the world's trading regime may sink with the seemingly electorally moribund governments in Washington and Paris.</p>

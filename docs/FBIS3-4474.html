			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Zhang Fengxi (1728 7685 0823) and Liu Keqian </F> (0491 0344 6197): "State Bonds in 1994: The `Gilt Edge' Will  Shine Again"]    [Text] State bonds, which were eulogized as gilt-edged  bonds" in 1992, were cold-shouldered in the securities market in  1993. Now that a new year has been ushered in, what fate lies  in store for the state bonds market? Securities dealers hold  that this market is likely to take off from its present trough  and become brisk again as a result of the enactment and  promulgation of certain laws, such as the "Law on the People's  Bank of China," the "Law on Securities," and the "Law on State  Bonds," along with the progress in reform of the monetary and  financial systems.  <H5>  "Gilt-Edged Bonds" Should Be Favored </H5>   Nowadays the Chinese people have a better understanding of  monetary affairs, as they are earning more and more money. They  want to put their spare money to work and are seeking the most  profitable channels for investment. Despite the numerous other  ways to make investments, there are at present three major ones:  Bank deposits, stocks, and bonds. To make the right choice,  people have to take three factors into consideration: security,  mobility, and return on investment.    In terms of security, state bonds are guaranteed by the  credit of the government. No matter how the market trend  changes, the investors will not suffer risks -- such as those  caused by poor management and bankruptcy of enterprises, as well  as by bad debts -- and their principal and interest are assured.  The risks on the stock market are much greater. On 10 October  1987, which was called Black Monday," the Dow-Jones Index fell  508 points in a single day, or a slump of 23 percent. Within  only a few hours, more than US$500 billion-worth of stocks  became worthless. Two big slumps in the stock markets in  Shenzhen and Shanghai also gave Chinese stockholders their first  taste of the risks in investing in stocks.    In terms of gains, the interest rate of state bonds is  1.72-2  percentage points higher than that of bank deposits. If one is  shrewd and buys state bonds on the securities market, one  normally can reap an even greater profit of 14-17 percent. Some  experts hold that judging by the experience in the development  of securities markets both at home and abroad, the rate of gains  from investment in stocks is roughly 10 percent, while that from  investment in bonds is about eight percent. The current  situation in China is that gains from investment in stocks are  several times or even a few dozen times higher than the gains  from investment in bonds. This is an infantile disorder of the  stock market, but it certainly cannot last for long, as the  stock market is becoming more mature.    In terms of mobility, a market for the circulation of state  bonds is taking shape in China. Along with the progress of  reform in the monetary and financial systems, a much improved  and unified national bond market develop rapidly. The mobility  of state bonds then will be greatly improved.    Compared with stocks and other securities, state bonds are  less risky, and they yield more lucrative gains than bank  deposits. Having the advantages of being risk-free, of being  cashable, and of being circulated throughout the country, state  bonds are the best thing for people to invest in: saving much  time, eliminating a lot of worry, and reaping steady profits.  If speculation in stocks and real estate is considered the  prerogative of the wealthy, investment in state bonds should be  regarded as the "territory" for wage earners. There is no  reason why state bonds should not be favored by the broad masses.  <H5>  Why Does the State Bond Market Fluctuate? </H5>   When the state first issued national treasury bonds to  citizens in 1982, it set the interest rate at 10 percent, which  was fairly high considering the actual situation at the time.  The bonds did not receive much response because the people did  not have as much money as they do now. At that time, the  issuance of state treasury bonds was treated as a political  task, and the overwhelming majority of people bought the bonds  merely to show their patriotism. Even then, however, a tiny  number of people saw that the value of the bonds could be  increased in circulation, and they secretly engaged in buying  and selling the bonds. After only a few years, some of these  people had become very wealthy. In legal terms, they were  "speculators" on the "black market." Objectively, however, they  played the role of promoting the circulation of state bonds.    The state treasury bonds issued in 1988 fared even worse.  Owing to the high inflation rate, those who bought the bonds  immediately dumped them on the market, causing a big slump in  the prices of state bonds and a rather long-term depression in  the state bond market. In 1990, the interest rate was raised to  14 percent. When people cashed the bonds three years later,  they found that gains from investment in the bonds were very  lucrative. When the bonds were put up for sale, they did not  neet with an enthusiastic response, probably because people had  not yet emerged from the shadow of inflation. The bonds were  neglected for a long time. Things began to turn for the better  in 1991. When the first batch of state treasury bonds was  issued in 1992, people rushed to purchase them, and in many  major cities people stood in line all night. By the end of May,  when the sales ended, many people -- especially those in the  smaller cities and rural counties -- complained that they had  been robbed of the opportunity. Nevertheless, the exciting  situation did not last long. When the second batch was issued  in June and July, the trend took a dramatic turn, and sales in  major cities were sluggish. When the first batch of bonds began  to enter the market for circulation in June, the prices nosed  down continuously. Later, the pirces of the first and second  batches of bonds even dropped below face value. The major  reasons for this situation were: First, most of the first batch  of bonds were held by institutional investors, and as the state  adopted measures to limit the hoarding of securities and the  re-loaning of funds, a large number of these investors had to  dump the bonds, to their own loss. Second, the overheated craze  in stocks and the pooling of funds siphoned off large amounts of  funds, which adversely affected the people's enthusiasm for  state treasury bonds. Third, the state bonds were not put on  sale in vast areas, and sales were not promoted vigorously.    People who bought the three-year state treasury bonds  suffered losses in 1992 owing to devaluation of the bonds. They  were scared away when the bonds were issued again in 1993, even  though the interest rate for three-year bonds was raised to  13.96 percent and that for five-year bonds was raised to 15.86  percent, in addition to government-approved measures to  guarantee their value. Only 15 percent of the bonds were sold on  schedule. In view of this situation, the sales period had to be  extended and administrative measures had to be taken. The task  was not completed until 15 July.    Despite the setbacks in the issuance of state treasury  bonds,  great achievements were made in 1993 in the development of the  state bond market. For instance, in conjunction with the  introduction of contracted buying and selling of some  no-certificate state treasury bonds in 1993, China successfully  established a system of self-management in dealing with state  bonds. This indicated that China's state bond market had taken  a satisfactory step toward standardization and operation in  accordance with international conventions. The introduction of  state bonds futures trading and the mechanism for buying back  the bonds also greatly spurred the development of the spot  market for state bonds. In mid-December 1993, the spot prices  of various types of state bonds all witnessed hikes to different  degrees, and began to emerge from the long-term trough. Since  the beginning of this year, the price hikes have become even  greater. The major reason for this situation is that the state,  be means of macroregulation and control, has curbed the the  overheated development of the real estate industry and the  pooling of private funds. Moreover, the introduction of major  measures for reform of the monetary and financial systems has  further demonstrated a brighter future for the state bond  market, thus enhancing investor confidence in these bonds.  <H5>  State Bonds Hopefully Will Be in Demand Again </H5>   Judging from the problems arising in the issuance and  circulation of state bonds in recent years, there are many  setbacks in the operational mechanism. The major ones are: The  circulation of state bonds has not been linked with the  circulation of bank credits, conspicuously narrowing the room  for development of the circulation market for such bonds; the  periods and varieties of state bonds are too restricted, making  them unable to meet the varied demands of investors in different  social strata; state bonds are issued in only a few months of  the year, which upsets the balance between supply and demand;  the interest rates of the bonds cannot change in line with  changes in the market, so China cannot establish a regulatory  fund to enforce effective regulation and control according to  changes in the market; and there are too many organizations in  charge of the issuance of state bonds, and they are inefficient.    In view of the problems in the operational mechanism, a  series of reform measures will be taken in the issuance of state  bonds this year. Securities dealers hold that the market for  these bonds this year enjoys promising prospects. Their major  arguments are: The establishment and development of a unified  national money market system, including state bonds, has been  listed as a major item on the reform agenda this year; the State  Council has decided that, starting from this year, the central  financial departments will no longer be allowed to overdraw from  the central bank to offset deficits, which can only be balanced  through issuing state bonds, and this means that both the amount  and varieties of bonds will be increased; on the basis ofthe  current medium- and long-term bonds, 8 to 10-year long-term  bonds and one-year short-term ones will be issued to meet the  varied demands of investors in different strata of society; this  year the central bank will try out the method of open market  operation, that is, using the purchase and sales of government  bonds and other monetary commodities to regulate the money  market, money supply, and interest rates. The issuance of state  securities will be contracted to a group of monetary  organizations that have the ability to undertake wholesale  business in these bonds, so as to replace the former practice of  apportioning, and the interest rates will be decided through  price competition on the market -- this, no doubt, will greatly  promote the circulation in the state bond market; the marketing  time for various bonds will be adjusted to give priority to the  issuance of state bonds, and bonds with different terms also  will be issued at different times so as to balance supply and  demand; work will begin to establish a unified national account  transfer and settlement system to provide investors with a  complete range of services in the purchase and transfer of state  bonds, as well as the payment of principal and interest, and to  introduce and expand the circulation of no-certificate state  bonds, improve the efficiency of market operation, and establish  a fund to regulate the operations of second-class markets and  improve the environment for first-class markets. In addition,  public fear of inflation will last for some time, and it  inevitably will drive many people to invest their money in  securities to prevent devaluation -- this will cause large sums  of money to flow into the state bond market.    Although state bond will be issued mainly to organizations  this year, this does not mean that ordinary citizens will not be  able to buy them, as it is reported that the Ministry of Finance  will issue savings bonds to individual investors in the form of  selling the bonds over special counters.</p>

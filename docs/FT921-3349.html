			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / As time goes by: Private Passions THE OLD clock on the mantlepiece is the still centre of a household, measuring a family's comings and goings from generation to generation. It is a potent symbol of continuity, a thing of beauty, a marvel of precision. But even clocks grow old, and antiques are in limited supply. Who today is producing the sort of clocks that our great-grandchildren will revere? David Poole, of Holmfirth in the West Riding of Yorkshire, is one of the few craftsmen whose name can be summoned up to answer that question. It is always unnerving to meet perfectionists; doubly unnerving to meet a perfectionist in horology. David Poole is a neat, precise, extremely modest man; there is nothing intimidating about him. But the marriage of precision with the objective of measuring time is bound to disturb anyone prone to idleness, or mortality, or simple imperfections. Last year the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers set up a competition for the design and execution of a Perpetual Calendar Clock; the winning entry now stands in David Poole's living-room. For as long as you live, this clock can tell you in which second of which minute of which hour of which day - and date - of which month you are living in. The movement of the clock is similar to that of the regulators once used by watchmakers to ensure precise adjustment of their watches. Such regulators never carried perpetual calendar mechanisms, for fear of compromising accuracy. But the perpetual calendar mechanism in David Poole's clock is driven by a separate falling weight which facilitates date changes (including the accommodation of leap years) with minimal variation in the clock's timekeeping. The duration of the clock is one month; the weight for the calendar mechanism requires raising once a year. This is an innovative clock. It is also a marvellously well-made piece of furniture. Apart from the engraving of the numerals and dates, everything about the clock bespeaks the skill of one man. David Poole produces all his own components, down to the smallest screw or pinion. 'You actually make your own screws?' asks the bumbling DIY dabbler. 'Of course,' he replies. This self-sufficient perfectionism includes a catholic range of skills: design, engineering, metalworking and cabinet-making. David Poole teaches a couple of days each week at the School of Horology in south Manchester; he spends most of his horological time repairing antique clocks. So creating tomorrow's antiques is very much a hobby-horse, pursued out of personal absorption. The prize-winning perpetual calendar clock took 18 months to conceive and construct. Mrs Poole rolls her eyes when you ask her how much she saw of her husband during that time. It is reminiscent of Matthew Boulton, favourite 18th century clockmaker of Sir Nicholas Goodison, the distinguished antiquarian horologist and former chairman of the London stock exchange. Boulton's masterpiece was a 'sidereal' or star-oriented clock, now celebrated by the Birmingham City Museum. But no one would buy it when it was made - and Boulton gloomily recorded that he would be more successful if he 'had made the clocks play jiggs upon-bells and a dancing bear keeping time.' Likewise, David Poole would probably make much more money if he created clocks which squirted electronic minuets on the hour. But he is hopeful that the quality of his work will win him the commissions he needs to design and manufacture his own clocks, thereby relieving him of the onus of repairing antiques. In early April he joins a quintet of independent British clockmakers in their first appearance at the European Watch, Clock and Jewellery Fair in Basel. Making clocks for posterity is all very well - but it is the present which either endows or cheats posterity. David Poole, Grad.

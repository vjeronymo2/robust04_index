He said the view that the high-ranking officials of  Slovakia's Hungarian parliamentary parties are some sort of  "lone runners" without any background seems to be unsound, as  current opinion polls indicate that the Egyutteles Hungarian  minority movement and the Hungarian Christian Democratic  Movement (MKDH) each represent 20 percent of the ethnic  Hungarian population.    Kanis said the worst shortcoming lies in the conceptlessness  of the Slovak Government and parliament in their approach to  ethnic minority issues. He said this approach should be changed  and these problems solved "comprehensively and definitively,"  since the failure to do so was constantly giving rise to new  Hungarian demands.    He said the SDL had long pointed to the necessity of solving  national minority problems with a constitutional law, but that  this had not been done. That Hungarian representatives  submitted such a bill to Parliament Chairman Ivan Gasparovic  last summer and that this bill was "swept off the table," as  they said, was unfortunate, Kanis said.    The problems of Hungarian and Slovak co-existence in  southern  Slovakia has become an international one, he said. That is why  it should be seen with "European eyes." That the SDL was a  representative of the forces which "want to reach a compromise"  is proved by its exemplary relations with the Hungarian  Socialist Party, Kanis said.</p>

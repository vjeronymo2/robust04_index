The proposed amendment consists of changes to Missouri statute, regulations, and reclamation plan provisions of the AML program pertaining to powers of the commission, AML reclamation fund, AML reclamation general requirements, identification and establishment of reclamation priority of sites, elimination of selected priority sites, project evaluation and ranking, and purchasing and procurement. The amendment is intended to revise the State AML Plan to be consistent with the corresponding Federal standards, clarify ambiguities, and improve operational efficiency. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This notice sets forth the times and locations that the Missouri AML Plan and proposed amendment to that Plan are available for public inspection, the comment period during which interested persons may submit written comments on the proposed amendment, and procedures that will be followed regarding the public hearing, if one is requested. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Written comments must be received by 4:00 p.m., c.s.t.

Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Title IV of SMCRA established an Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation (AMLR) program for the purposes of reclaiming and restoring lands and water resources adversely affected by past mining. This program is funded by a reclamation fee imposed upon the production of coal. As enacted in 1977, lands and waters eligible for reclamation were those that were mined or affected by mining and abandoned or left in an inadequate reclamation status prior to August 3, 1977, and for which there was no continuing reclamation responsibility under State or Federal law. The AML Reclamation Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;508, Title VI, Subtitle A, Nov. 5, 1990, effective Oct. 1, 1991) amended SMCRA, 30 U.S.C. 1231  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to provide changes in the eligibility of project sites for AML expenditures. The Secretary adopted AML regulations (59 FR 28136, May 31, 1994) at 30 CFR Subchapter R, Parts 795, 870, 872, 873, 874, 875, 876, and 886 to implement this act. Title IV of SMCRA now provides for reclamation of certain mine sites where the mining occurred after August 3, 1977. These include interim program sites where bond forfeiture proceeds were insufficient for adequate reclamation and sites affected any time between August 4, 1977, and November 5, 1990, for which there were insufficient funds for adequate reclamation due to the insolvency of the bond surety. Title IV provides that a State with an approved AMLR program has the responsibility and primary authority to implement the program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

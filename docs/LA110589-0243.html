			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WE'LL ALL SOON KNOW WHAT BUSH IS MADE OF;  </P> <P> PRESIDENCY: DANIEL ORTEGA AND THE GORBACHEV SUMMIT WILL FORCE THE DECISIONS  THAT WILL DEFINE THIS ADMINISTRATION.  </P> <P> Two decades ago this week, in what seems another country, the United States was  at war in Vietnam. And we were at war with one another. Richard Nixon, elected  in a dead heat with Hubert Humphrey, with 43% of the vote, was a President  besieged.  </P> <P> On Oct. 15, 250,000 people arrived in Washington to protest the war. A number  twice that, containing radical and violent elements, was expected Nov. 15. The  demonstrations were to continue, monthly, until the White House buckled.  </P> <P> Having pocketed Nixon's concessions on Great Society spending and troop  withdrawals, the press began its drumbeat. "Nixon in Trouble!" read Newsweek's  cover. Time's national affairs section said it was, "Nixon's Worst Week." "(I)t  is becoming obvious with each passing day," wrote David Broder, "that the men  and the movement that broke Lyndon Johnson's authority in 1968 are out to break  Richard Nixon in 1969. The likelihood is great that they will succeed again."  </P> <P> His White House split between accommodation and defiance, Nixon concludedthat  his presidency was indeed at the breaking point and elected to turn and fight.  </P> <P> On Nov. 3, 1969, in an address whose tone shocked his pursuers, Nixon asked the  "Great Silent Majority" to stand with him, and against the protesters and the  Establishment prodding them on.  </P> <P> It was the defining moment of the Nixon presidency. Followed by Spiro Agnew's  assault on the networks, 10 days later, Nixon's speech polarized the nation. By  mid-November, his approval had soared to 69%. Nixon had set himself on a course  leading, three years later, to the greatest landslide in history.  </P> <P> While today's situation is less dramatic, George Bush is clearly at the  defining moment of his presidency.  </P> <P> And it was the little fascist, Daniel Ortega, who put him there.  </P> <P> Lynn Bouchey of the Council on Inter-American Security explains why: "Trailing  in the polls, Ortega is worried that he will be forced to steal or call off the  elections and then face the prospect of renewed fighting." Ortega must kill off  the Contras, so that if he loses the election, he is free to retain power by  force.  </P> <P> By launching his attack now, Ortega has forced Bush either to watch, paralyzed  and pathetic, as the Contras are butchered, or go to Congress and demand  military aid, reigniting the war and giving Ortega the excuse he seeks to  cancel elections.  </P> <P> "Coming soon, the Bush Administration!" is how a joke marquee read months ago.  It was apposite. Before autumn is over, Bush will have made the choices that  define his presidency.  </P> <P> Thus far, the Administration theme has been "bipartisanship," a near compulsion  to practice the soothing politics of compromise.  </P> <P> In the name of bipartisanship, Bush let pass the lynching of his friend, John  Tower. He has watched without protest the steady de-funding of the Strategic  Defense Initiative. With James Baker insisting the votes were not there, the  White House declined to fight for Contra aid. This week, Bush signed a 27%  increase in the minimum wage, which will destroy thousands of entry-level jobs.  One conservative position after another has been offered up on the altar of  bipartisanship.  </P> <P> On the other hand, Bush has held the line on taxes. With Budget Director  Richard Darman pressing the case, he may yet hold the line on spending,  allowing the Gramm-Rudman budget cuts to take effect. After hesitation, Bush  also toughened up on abortion funding.  </P> <P> By leaning now left, now right, Bush has excited no one, but then he has  fatally antagonized no one, which, in the galaxy of the moderate Republican, is  apparently the best of all possible worlds.  </P> <P> But now comes the Club Med summit, and the stakes are huge. The left has its  agenda, which, unsurprisingly, is virtually the same as Mikhail Gorbachev's. It  wants Bush to let Ortega finish the Contras, to open up credit lines to Moscow  and to serve as sponsor for the Soviet president's entry into the World Bank  and International Monetary Fund. And the left wants Bush to accelerate the  timetable for a strategic-arms reduction agreement. If the President comes home  with that kind of "success," he will be hailed as a peacemaker by the press.  His center-right coalition will disintegrate.  </P> <P> Bush probably cannot get through the fall without choosing. He will emerge  either as an Eisenhower, committed to splitting the difference with the  Democrats, or in the Nixon-Reagan mold.  </P> <P> Before Christmas, Bush will likely make the decisions that define his  presidency. On saving the Contras, on arms control, on Eastern Europe, on the  bailout of Gorbachev. At long last, clarity.  </P></p>

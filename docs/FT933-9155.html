			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Arts: Today's Television Should we count Jonathan Ross's series Fantastic Facts] as a success or a failure? Launched as a sort of 'Tit Bits' of the air, it went into ITV's Top 30 at No 18 in its first week, with an audience of 9.9m. However, its second episode slipped to No 28 with 7.7m, since when it has hovered around the No 30 spot with about 7m viewers. It is up against the Paul Daniels quiz show Every Second Counts on BBC1 which is currently attracting about 6.4m viewers. So during that half hour the audience is pretty evenly split between Britain's two main channels. At 7.30, however, Coronation Street begins, for decades the biggest and most consistent ratings winner in the UK. The Roundhouse at Chalk Farm in London used to be one of the best performance spaces in the metropolis. But since we were threatened with the racist notion of turning it into a 'black arts centre' in the 1980s the place has been out of action. It will be interesting to see whether Black Bag Special (9.00 C4) manages to resist the lure of black separatism, or apartheid as it would be called elsewhere.</p>

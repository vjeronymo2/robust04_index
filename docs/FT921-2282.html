			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Platinum down on S African vote PLATINUM'S PRICES fell sharply in London and New York yesterday as it became clear that South Africa's white voters had approved political reform by a wide margin in their referendum. The referendum result ended concerns that a 'no' vote might be followed by disruption at the South African platinum mines which between them last year contributed nearly three-quarters of world supply outside the former eastern bloc countries  - 2.9m out of 4m troy ounces. At one stage in London yesterday the price was quoted at Dollars 348.50-Dollars 349.50 an ounce, nearly Dollars 7 below Tuesday's close. Yesterday's London closing price was Dollars 352.25, down Dollars 3.50 an ounce for the second successive day. Since Tuesday morning platinum had lost about 2 per cent of its value. On the New York Mercantile Exchange at midday platinum's most-active April contract had fallen below the psychologically-important Dollars 350 an ounce level to Dollars 349. 'Platinum needs to get back to about Dollars 353-Dollars 354 an ounce, otherwise more waves of selling could push it down into the low Dollars 340s,' one London dealer said. Mr Michael Spriggs, analyst at the S G Warburg Securities financial services group, pointed out that, when there were no other influences, precious metals tended to feed off one another and platinum would follow gold's performance. Gold, which lost 2 per cent of its value on Monday and Tuesday, recovered slightly yesterday and closed in London up Dollars 1.20 at Dollars 340.60 an ounce. Mr Spriggs said platinum was now virtually an industrial metal and would do better in the second half-year as economic recovery began to be felt in the US. Warburg had forecast an average price of Dollars 385 an ounce for 1992 but this was in the process of being revised downwards to about Dollars 370 or Dollars 375.</p>

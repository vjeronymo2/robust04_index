			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Hurd seeks to heal rift on Europe MR DOUGLAS HURD, the foreign secretary, yesterday sought to bridge government divisions over next year's European parliament elections by distancing the Conservative party from its federalist allies. Speaking to Conservative activists in the Cornwall European constituency, Mr Hurd said the party would campaign hard in the June elections to defeat the parliament's socialist majority. But he said the manifesto would not endorse the federalist platform of the European People's Party group, to which the Conservative parliamentary group belongs. 'We urgently need to restore a centre-right majority in the parliament, with more Conservative MEPs working with - but not subordinate to - our allies in the EPP,' he said. 'The European Parliament is too important to be hijacked by yesterday's men with tired ideas. Our candidates will fight on a Conservative manifesto which we have begun to prepare.' The party's link with the EPP has angered rightwing Euro-sceptics, prompting some to decline to canvass for candidates suspected of being 'soft' on federalism. Conservative leaders are keenly aware that continuing divisions on Europe could lead to an embarrassing defeat. The Tories lost a third of their European seats in the 1989 election, when they emerged with 32 of the 78 British mainland seats, compared with 45 won by Labour. According to confidential research by Conservative Central Office, up to a quarter of party seats are threatened, mostly by Liberal Democrats.</p>

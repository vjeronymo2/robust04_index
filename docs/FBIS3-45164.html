			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News" program] </F>   [Text] Minister without Portfolio Chiu Hung-tao said  Tuesday [11 January] it is up to Peking [Beijing] whether the  Vatican will maintain diplomatic ties with Taipei after  establishing such relations with mainland China. Chiu was  responding to reports that the Vatican will establish formal  diplomatic relations with the mainland, but will not sever  existing relations with Taiwan.    Chiu claimed that the problem of dual recognition for the  ROC  and the PRC will have to be determined largely by Peking's  attitude. He said that if the PRC approves of the scheme, there  will be no reason why other countries should cut their  diplomatic ties with the ROC. Some people are worried that this  could encourage other countries with formal ties with Taiwan to  recognize the mainland and down- grade their envoys here. Chiu  said that perhaps more countries which previously did not  recognize Taiwan would decide to follow the Vatican's example in  setting up an official office here without breaking ties with  the mainland.</p>

			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Advertising manager contests dismissal A FORMER newspaper advertising manager told an industrial tribunal in London yesterday she was forced out of a job by her manager's attitude to working mothers. Ms Suzanne Bennett, a Pounds 25,000-a-year advertising manager with Express Newspapers until last year, is claiming sexual discrimination and unfair dismissal and seeking compensation for lost earnings. She said that while on maternity leave she heard that Mr Michael Moore sales director, planned to make her life 'difficult' so she would resign. She returned to work in January last year after giving birth to a son. She said that in August Mr Moore told her he was surprised she had not had a nervous breakdown 'juggling' her responsibilities. She told the hearing he offered her five months' salary and her company car if she left the company. Ms Bennett, who denied that she had had any difficulty coping with motherhood, said Mr Moore upset her by pushing her to make a decision she did not want to make. She accepted his offer, but a few days later Mr Moore called her into his office and told her she had been sacked and should clear her desk that day. Ms Bennett said that instead of the earlier package she had been offered she was told she would receive only the statutory three months' salary. Mr Moore denied sacking Ms Bennett and said her evidence that he would not permit her to put her point of view by discussing the possibility of her leaving was a 'figment of her imagination'. The hearing was adjourned to a date to be fixed.</p>

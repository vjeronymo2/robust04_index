			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / International Company News: Great Nordic Holding GREAT NORDIC Holding, which administers its shareholding in the telecommunications and electro-technical manufacturing group GN Great Nordic, reported a decline in net profits from DKr23.8m (Dollars 3.64m) to DKr8.9m in the year to June 30, writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen. An unchanged dividend of DKr12 per share (12 per cent) will be paid. GN Great Nordic's operating profit increased from DKr96m to DKr113m but after extraordinary items, covering restructuring costs and write-downs, profits fell from DKr93m to DKr33m. The holding company said GN Great Nordic's operating profit would improve in the current year as income from administration of new telecommunications cables came in. The cables include the optical fibre cable link between Copenhagen and St Petersburg, with a microwave link to Moscow, which came into operation in April and has brought a significant improvement in telecommunications between Russia and western Europe.</p>

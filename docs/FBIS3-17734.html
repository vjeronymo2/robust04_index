Repeated voting will be held in Kiev's 21 constituencies, in 18  constituencies in Crimea, in 32 constituencies in Dnepropetrovsk  oblast, in six constituencies in Ivano-Frankovsk, in 17  constituencies in Vinnitsa, and in all four constituencies in  Sevastopol. Why the repeated elections? Because not a single  candidate has gathered 50 percent of votes. We had the  situation when there were on average 13 candidates in each  constituency. There were constituencies with 31 candidates, 32,  or 28 candidates. It is very difficult to chose in such a  situation. [end recording]    [Announcer] Altogether, about 40 deputies to a new  parliament  were elected in the first round of voting. Our correspondent  has learned this at the republican embassy in Moscow. More  details about the elections from Vadym Dolganov, press attache  of the Ukrainian embassy in Moscow.    [Begin Dolganov recording] Those elected include the former  Ukrainian prime minister, Leonid Kuchma. He gathered 91 percent  of votes in his constituency in Dnepropetrovsk. Also in the  lead is the current parliamentary speaker Ivan Plyushch. He  also has splendid results - 71 per cent of votes. Furthermore,  Volodymyr Pylypchuk, who headed the permanent commission on  issues of economic reform, and the well-known Stepan Khmara also  became deputies to the new parliament. The former vice premier  Volodymyr Lanovyy, an economist and reformer, also had a good  lead. Dmytro Pavlychko, the chairman of the permanent  commission on international issues of the former parliament, was  not elected. [end recording]    [Announcer] The Ukrainian diplomat also stressed that none  of  the deputies was elected in Nikolayev oblast, and only one  deputy in Zaporozhye. The second round of voting to the  Ukrainian parliament is to be held in three weeks.</p>

Addressing a meeting Thursday [20 January], Zhang Baifa, an  executive deputy mayor of Beijing, said that the reform of  personnel management is one of the most crucial measures to be  taken this year to promote economic development and bring the  potential of civil servants in the municipal organizations into  full play.    The capital's personnel management system reform aims at  restructuring government organizations, putting the civil  service system into practice and speeding up the wage system  reform in government organizations, the deputy mayor said.    The municipal government will work hard to achieve a healthy  development of the city's center where talented people can seek  new and suitable jobs.    The capital will also speed up the social insurance system  reform in municipal government organizations so as to maintain  social stability and guarantee personnel management reform.    In addition, effective measures will be taken to enable  large  and medium-sized state-run enterprises and the rural areas of  the capital to stem the brain drain, Zhang said.</p>

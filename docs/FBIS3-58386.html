Launching the appeal, the federation said the funds are  needed to plan and finance humanitarian aid to some 13.2 million  people in 46 countries.    "With the end of the Cold War disasters of all kinds have  become more frequent and more complex, affecting a growing  number of people whose already precarious situation gets worse  each year," said Secretary-General Georges Weber.    Europe and in particular the former Yugoslavia, the Caucasus  and states that emerged from the collapse of the Soviet Union  head the list of targets, requiring 200 million francs to aid  8.6 million people.    In Africa the federation will need 90 million francs to  finance its operations for three million people in 16 countries.    "With this appeal we must address the daily needs of the  victims of forgotten disasters -- disasters which are often more  devastating, more long term and more related to violent conflict  than natural disaster," said Stephen Davey, under-secretary  general for operations.</p>

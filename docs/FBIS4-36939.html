			<p>BFN     [Text] Concerning Western Sahara, we note this statement by  the Algerian foreign minister, as reported by the Moroccan daily  L'OPINION. According to L'OPINION, Mr. Mohammed Salah Dembri  said that a political solution that could bypass a referendum in  Western Sahara is possible. Asked to be more precise, the  Algerian foreign minister stressed that such a political  solution would be a structure which would accommodate the  Western Saharan status within a Moroccan entity.</p>

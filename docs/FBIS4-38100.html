			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, June 24, IRNA -- Provisional leader of the  Friday congregational prayers in Tehran, Ayatollah Mohammad  Emami-Kashani, here today termed the bomb blast at the mausoleum  of Imam Reza (as) [peace be upon him] in Mashhad on Monday [20  June] "a criminal act" and "a war against Islam."    "If the house of Ka'ba or the mausoleum of prophet (pbuh)  [peace be upon him] were in Iran, the criminals would not  hesitate to commit such crimes against those holy places as  well," Ayatollah Kashani told the congregation of worshippers  gathered at Tehran University campus. The provisional leader of  the Friday congregational prayers underlined that many  traditions exist about the prophet's blessed household  (ahlulbeit) which stipulate that those who are hostile towards  the prophet's household, are not following any of the Islamic  sects. He said that those who committed this crime were in  complete darkness and that they were incapable of having any  human feeling.    Ayatollah Kashani went on to add that the emergence of the  Islamic resurgence in the world could explain why such acts of  terror were committed against Islam and Muslims.    Referring to the enemies of worldwide Islamic movement, he  said that "they had also shown their unhappiness with Islam  through explosions and acts of terrorism that they committed  prior to this last incident, (and now) they are hiring those who  are mentally and emotionally slaves and those who are poor in  spirit."    Ayatollah Kashani added that the more horrible the crime,  the  more effect it will have on helping the growth of political  consciousness of the people. "The more horrendous the crime,  the more the people's growth and falsehood will gain nothing but  misery," he said.    He then addressed the Muslim nations, asking them to condemn  this crime. "This tragedy is an insult to the divinely  sanctified areas. this is a terrorist conspiracy to destabilize  the (Muslim) countries. Not only Iran, but also the whole  Muslim world, should condemn this horrifying crime," he said.    Ayatollah Kashani then invited both Christians and Jews,  respectfully known in Islam as the people of the book, to  condemn this crime. "Of course the Islamic institutions, both  Sunni and Shia, have condemned this crime and this is not  sufficient. The whole Muslim world and also the people of the  book should come out and condemn this act."    He also lambasted the world bodies for keeping mum on this  crime. "The world bodies that always make hue and cry over human  rights should ask themselves why the paid mercenaries of the  world arrogance have committed such a terrible crime," he added.</p>

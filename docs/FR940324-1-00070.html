			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As for the debt-to-income ratio to be used, the Secretary notes that the HEA has created a mandatory forbearance for a borrower who has a Title IV debt-to-income ratio that equals or exceeds 20 percent. Since a deferment during which the borrower's interest is paid by the federal government provides a much greater financial benefit to a borrower than a forbearance, it would be logical to establish a similar standard for a borrower to meet to qualify for a deferment. Therefore, in the Secretary's opinion, the 20 percent ratio is appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary estimates that lenders collectively will need an additional 14,000 hours to process the statutorily required economic hardship deferments for borrowers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The income and debt documentation required from borrowers (the borrower's most recent Federal income tax return if one had been filed within six months prior to the date it is requested by the lender; evidence showing the amount of the borrower's most recent monthly disposable income; and evidence showing the most recent monthly amount due on the borrower's non-defaulted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> education loans (or eligible defaulted loans) that were obtained through a Federal program) is needed to obtain verifiable data to accurately determine the borrower's eligibility to receive an economic hardship deferment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 682.211&blank;Forbearance <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Consistent with the rationale expressed earlier with regard to income-sensitive repayment schedules and economic hardship deferments, the Secretary does not believe it would be helpful to the borrower or in the interests of the taxpayer if a borrower who has the means to repay the loan does not do so. The Secretary proposes that, in order to qualify for a mandatory general forbearance under &sect;682.211(i)(2)_which permits a borrower to postpone making scheduled loan payments_a borrower should be required to provide at least a copy of his or her most recent Federal income tax return if one had been filed within six months prior to the date the forbearance is requested, and evidence showing the amount of the borrower's most recent monthly disposable income. In conformance with section 428(b)(1)(V) of the HEA, this requirement does not apply if the borrower is a medical or dental intern or resident, as described in &sect;682.211(i)(1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on comments received at the regional meetings and other information provided to the Secretary from other sources, the Secretary has concluded that the public's views concerning the general applicability of the use of an administrative forbearance to assist a borrower in avoiding default should be reflected in the proposed regulations. The Secretary agrees that it would be in the best interests of borrowers and taxpayers to require lenders to grant administrative forbearance to borrowers or endorsers under the exceptional conditions described in &sect;682.211(j), such as emergencies and national disasters, whereas the granting of the forbearances authorized under &sect;682.211(f) is best left to the judgement of the lender on a case-by-case basis. The proposed regulations would permit a lender to grant forbearance under &sect;682.211 for a period of up to 3 years if the effect of an income-sensitive repayment schedule causes the extension of the maximum repayment term of the loan, and up to one year if the effect of a variable interest rate on a fixed-amount or graduated repayment schedule similarly causes the extension of the maximum repayment term.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary estimates that lenders collectively will need an additional 15,000 hours to process mandatory forbearances for borrowers. The income and debt documentation required from borrowers (the borrower's most recent Federal income tax return if one had been filed within six months prior to the date it is requested by the lender; evidence showing the amount of the borrower's most recent monthly disposable income; and evidence showing the most recent monthly amount due on the borrower or endorser's Title IV loans) is needed to obtain verifiable data to accurately determine the borrower or endorser's eligibility to receive a mandatory forbearance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These proposed regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order the Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this regulatory action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The potential costs associated with the proposed regulations are those resulting from statutory requirements and those determined by the Secretary to be necessary for administering this program effectively and efficiently, as discussed in those sections of the preamble that relate to specific sections of the regulations. Burdens specifically associated with information collection requirements, if any, are identified and explained elsewhere in this preamble under the heading Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

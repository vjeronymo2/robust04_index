			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus  Kinkel (Free Democratic Party) has rejected Russian ideas for a  European security system. Subordinating NATO to the Conference  for Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), as Russia has in  mind, "would run counter to our security interests and is not  acceptable," Kinkel said today at the NATO foreign ministers'  spring conference in Istanbul. NATO remained the anchor for  security and stability in Europe, the advance release of  Kinkel's speech said. It is important for Russia to take an  active part in the Partnership for Peace. Over and above that,  relations should be deepened, Kinkel stressed, calling for the  meeting to give a signal to that effect to Moscow. However,  this "by no means meant a directorate of NATO and Russia for  European security questions." Nor can Russia "receive any kind  of right of veto over alliance decisions."</p>

Robaina is paying an official visit to Vietnam during which  he met with several Vietnamese officials, including Prime  Minister Vo Van Kiet and Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam.    In a solemn ceremony at the fatherland's building, Robaina  handed over awards to the three children winners of the "On the  Way to Cuba" contest sponsored by the Vietnamese Pioneers  organization.    Robaina said that together with the tremendous material  value  of the rice and school supplies donated by the Vietnamese people  to Cuba, this Asian country is an endless source of incentive  with its work and spirit of sacrifice.</p>

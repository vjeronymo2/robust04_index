"Giving tribute to the competence, courage and the  contribution which Yegor Gaydar made into the course of economic  reform, I understand the arguments and motives which made him  offer to resign", Yeltsin said in a statement received by TASS.    "Accepting this resignation I would like to stress the  irreversibility of the course of reform aimed at a deep and  democratic transformation of the Russian society, its economy  and political institutions. The policy of reform will continue  proceeding from democratic principles which are the basis of the  new Russian Constitution and with account, first and foremost,  of the national and strategic Russian interests", the president  said.    "I express conviction that while working in the State Duma  Yegor Gaydar will proceed from the supreme interests of serving  Russia like he did in his previous activities", according to the  statement distributed by presidential spokesman Vyacheslav  Kostikov.    This is the second time that Gaydar has to abandon his post  in the government. In December 1992 Yeltsin replaced him with  Viktor Chernomyrdin after a severe conflict with the parliament  on the course of reform.    Gaydar returned to the government as first deputy premier in  the middle of September 1993.    After December 12 parliamentary elections Yeltsin said at a  press conference that Gaydar will remain in the government and  reforms will continue.</p>

			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> WASHINGTON STATE;  </P> <P> JUDGE OKS NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAM  </P> <P> The legality of the nation's first hypodermic-needle exchange program has been  upheld by a judge in Tacoma, Wash. Superior Court Judge Robert Peterson said  there is only preliminary proof that the program is slowing the spread of AIDS  but added: "To wait until you get that concrete, specific evidence is too  late." Each week, health workers at the Tacoma-Pierce County Health Department  distribute about 2,000 clean needles to drug users in return for used ones.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The Institute of Physical and Chemical Research  (Riken) has started to work towards a ``biomimetic control  research'' which aims at artificially manufacturing the highly  precise movement functions of the living body. Under the  internationally opened research system, Riken will perform basic  research and its frontier research system will evolve in the  Nagoya area.    The research by Riken will be at the Biomimetic Control  Research Center (Center chief, Masami Ito, Professor of  University of Nagoya, Engineer Department), and will be  organized into research teams assigned to the following  sections: 1) movement circuit net, 2) movement genetics, 3)  living body mimetic sensor and 4) control system theory.</p>

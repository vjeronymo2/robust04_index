			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: FOOT SOLDIERS IN WAR ON DRUGS  </P> <P> It's frustrating to declare a war and have no one show up for it. That's what  has been happening in the war on drugs.  </P> <P> Forget the pride and the spirit of our young people marching off to battle to  conquer the enemy. We can't even get their attention. We have begged the "Yes"  generation to form the battle cry "No!" We have threatened them with horror  pictures of an egg frying in a skillet with the explanation, "This is your  brain on drugs." We have flashed their friends, their sports heroes and their  rock legends on the 10 o'clock news as they shielded their eyes from the shame  of their addiction. They still consider it a big joke.  </P> <P> I don't know anymore what it would take to make just one child think twice  about trying drugs, but I'm going to give it a shot:  </P> <P> A little over two years ago, I gathered a bunch of kids around me and put their  stories between the covers of a new book due out this week called, "I Want to  Grow Hair, I Want to Grow Up, I Want to Go to Boise." The title doesn't mean a  lot unless you know that these are the three wishes of a 9-year-old girl in  Washington state who is recovering from cancer.  </P> <P> All the kids in the book are recovering from cancer. You want to talk drugs?  You're a civilian when it comes to their expertise. For more than 30 years they  have been in the front lines of cancer research trying out every experimental  drug that comes down the pike to see if it kills or cures.  </P> <P> Although some of the kids are so little they can't pronounce or spell the drug  they are taking, they're like a walking drug store. What do these "goodies" do  for them? Sometimes a drug curls feet and hands into positions that could be  temporary or not. Others cause hair to fall out. Some create mood swings and  sores in the mouth and down the esophagus. A few of the drugs render muscles  useless and the users must have a wheelchair. Many have a genetic impact. Some  drugs blow them up like an inflatable beach ball. Others make them lose weight  and they become so weak they can barely hold on.  </P> <P> If I sound angry, count on it. You bet I'm sore. I'm angry because in a society  where the drop-out rate from school is a national epidemic, I met a girl  desperate to finish high school. In a world where people have every right and  hope of becoming 70 or 80 years old, a little boy is fighting to be 8. Peer  pressure, you say? You want to know what peer pressure is? It's a bald-headed  12-year-old girl at her first school dance!  </P> <P> One young man in remission said he tells his friends who do drugs, "You want to  do drugs? Do chemotherapy for a year. It'll make you feel just as lousy."  </P> <P> These kids don't have a choice. You do.  </P></p>

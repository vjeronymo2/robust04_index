			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "rk": "In Every Secret Ballot, Nine Coalition </F> Deputies Supposedly Side With the Movement for a Democratic  Slovakia"]    [Text] Bratislava--When giving consideration to  postelection coalitions, we do not seclude ourselves from  anyone, with the exception of Miklos Duray. The decision on who  will be our partner will be made by the voter, Vladimir Meciar,  deputy to the National Council of the Slovak Republic and  chairman of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS], said  at yesterday's "13 Plus One" meeting organized by the editorial  staff of SLOBODNY PIATOK. According to what he said, the  question of holding elections has not been definitely settled  because "in the course of the current meeting of the National  Council of the Slovak Republic, our deputies have been  approached by two people--Deputy Gburova, with the proposal that  the election date be postponed by two years, and Deputy Bajan,  with the request for four more [HZDS] deputies so that they get  the 90 votes [needed to pass constitutional laws]." Vladimir  Meciar also contested reports about nocturnal meetings of his  government to approve privatization projects: "After the  passage of the vote of no-confidence in us, we had dinner and a  friendly chat about what we would do the next day.... We were  not approving any privatization projects; that had been done  before, and even that concerned only four or five projects, I  think, and I was not personally present." Meciar claimed that  parliament is in a state of decay, which he supported by saying  that, whenever there is a secret ballot in the National Council  of the Slovak Republic, nine people vote along with the HZDS.  Supposedly, these deputies only failed during the dismissal of  the government, but they had already apologized to him and  explained their reasons.</p>

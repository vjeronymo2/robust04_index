			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / The Labour Party Conference: Blair pledges 'crusade' against crime A CRUSADE to free people from the fear of crime was promised by Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, in a determined attempt to establish Labour as 'the party of law and order' in Britain. Mr Blair coupled a fierce condemnation of the failure of government policies with a pledge that Labour would be 'tough on crime, and tough on the causes of crime'. He also attacked government proposals for replacing elected members of police authorities with ministerial nominees, and the apparent intention to amalgamate some of the smaller constabularies. The next Labour government will introduce a wide-ranging package of constitutional reforms, Mr Blair said. He promised a freedom of information act, tighter control of donations to political parties, abolition of the House of Lords, and the adoption of the European Convention on Human Rights. He also said Labour would establish Scottish and Welsh parliaments, introduce proportional representation for the European parliament and hold a referendum on the voting system for the House of Commons 'What we propose is a revolution in democratic accountability and control to redistribute power from the government to the people,' Mr Blair said.</p>

			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Letter: Cyrus Vance, not EC, behind Yugoslav lull Sir, Your editorial, 'Next steps in Yugoslavia' (January 16), unconvincingly attributes the present lull in Yugoslav fighting to 'unilateral German diplomacy'. Germany has been on one side of the Yugoslav conflict right from the start of the present fighting, making its entire diplomatic and media services available to former Second World War ally Croatia along with secessionist Slovenia. The fighting became an inevitability once the Serbs in Croatia realised that they might well find themselves imprisoned within another independent state of Croatia for the second time in 50 years. With its most powerful and dominant member on one side of the conflict it was only predictable that any EC initiatives were going to be heavily distorted in favour of the secessionist republics and stood little chance of acceptance at any diplomatic or negotiation level. Far more convincing has been the involvement of Mr Cyrus Vance and his UN team who, almost on their own, achieved within a few weeks what German-led EC unilateralism failed to achieve in six months. Many of the EC moves and proposals have been unprecedented in their deviation from international legal norms and ignored many EC procedures as well. It is now far more likely that several Northern Irelands have been created where a once multi-ethnic state was able to guarantee minority rights far better than the untried and instantly ignored (by Germany and the EC) paper guarantees now on the table.

			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / People: Europe's realistic banker - Alexandre Lamfalussy of the European Monetary Institute explains his hopes for monetary union to Peter Norman and Andrew Fisher These are busy days for Alexandre Lamfalussy, president of the European Monetary Institute. After 10 months squatting in buildings belonging to the Basle-based Bank for International Settlements, the forerunner of the planned European central bank is about to move to its new home in Frankfurt and start working at full speed. From the 35th floor of an office block re-christened the 'Eurotower', Lamfalussy will preside over a staff of around 150, who will be charged with making possible European monetary union according to the procedures laid down by the Maastricht treaty. It is a two-pronged task. The EMI's job is to make the preparations needed for setting up the European System of Central Banks and, with that, a single monetary policy and single currency, if and when the EU moves to the third and final stage of Emu. The institute also has to help prepare for Stage 3 by co-ordinating monetary policy among the EU's 12 central banks and promoting the convergence of the EU member states' economies on a path of sustained low inflationary growth in the present Stage 2 of Emu. Although the EMI is about 10 months behind schedule - thanks to prolonged wrangling among European Union countries over its eventual site - Lamfalussy is hopeful it will be able to achieve its goals. Interviewed in his still-temporary headquarters in the BIS, he says: 'Things are not as negative as they looked a year ago. Europe is enjoying a broad-based, non-inflationary recovery. If this goes on for two to three years it will create a climate which at least provides a framework for the political decisions to move ahead.' Like most Belgians, the 65-year-old Lamfalussy is a card-carrying Emu enthusiast. In his previous capacity as BIS general manager, he was a member of the Delors committee of central bankers that in the late 1980s plotted the three-stage route march to monetary union, later adopted in the Maastricht treaty. But Lamfalussy is also a realist. Achieving Emu by 1997, the earliest possible date envisaged in the Maastricht treaty, he says 'is not very plausible' because it is difficult to imagine seven of the 12 EU member states fulfilling the treaty's strict economic convergence criteria by then. On the other hand, his belief is that there will eventually be a European central bank 'in five, six or 10 years' time.' 'The degree of internationalisation and integration of our economies is so fast and the European single market is moving ahead so fast and is going so deep, that so many vested interests will want stable exchange rates,' he says. His gut feeling, speaking as an economist, is that Britain will be unable to stand aside from Emu. But whether the UK joins Emu is a matter of high politics. The EMI has to focus on nitty-gritty matters and achieve agreement on such technically difficult issues as the preparation of banknotes to be used after the introduction of a single currency, as well as the drawing up of common features of payments systems in the EU. A potentially difficult issue is management of the single monetary policy. The Bundesbank is actively promoting the notion that the proposed European central bank should follow its example and set monetary policy according to a money supply measure, while the Bank of England is promoting its more eclectic approach of steering policy according to an inflation target. Here, too, Lamfalussy is relatively sanguine. There is, he explains, 'no cleavage in ideology' among the European central bank governors that make up the EMI's council. All agree on the need for low inflation and the paramount importance of governments reducing their fiscal deficits. There may be different techniques of monetary management but there are also similarities. The Bank of England, for example, looks at narrow and broad money figures as part of its policy for controlling inflation. Reconciling differences will be a big part of Lamfalussy's job at the EMI. As president, he is both chief executive officer and chairman of the board. His task will be 'to make sure things are going to happen,' driving the technical committees - comprised of EMI staffers and national central bank officials - so that they come with answers to problems. He has been able to hand-pick his senior staff and has managed to avoid placing people in posts according to national quotas. Although Frankfurt-based, the institute's working language will be English. But language will be the least of Lamfalussy's problems. He has perfected his English since a spell as a research student at Nuffield College, Oxford, in the 1950s. That was shortly after he fled to Belgium from Hungary at the age of 20 to escape communism. He was a bank economist and academic until the mid-1970s, when he became an executive director and chairman of the Banque de Bruxelles. He joined the BIS in 1976 and was general manager of the central bankers' bank from 1985 until the end of last year. He can claim to be the inventor of the EMI because, as a member of the Delors committee, he proposed that Europe's central banks should create a joint subsidiary to advance the progress of Emu in Stage 2. The job of running the institute is 'different from anything else I have ever done before,' he says. He admits that he had more power as BIS general manager because, as the man in charge of the central bankers' bank, he was 'living the markets' and had to take banking decisions. It is the banking that he misses most: 'It was great fun, of great interest, and it gave me, as an economist, a lot of feedback'. On the other hand he believes he has much greater influence as head of the EMI. 'I have a much more politically exposed profile, there is no doubt about that. Even if you define the job in a narrow technical way, it still has very deep political connotations.' Then there is challenge of building a new institution. 'I have never built an institution in my life. You can't imagine what it means to build up something from scratch. It is a very, very full time job. 'I am trying to use the present relatively calm waters to make the institution function, to build up its staff and working methods. If and when a crisis breaks, we will see how I shall be able to handle it'. Lamfalussy has been appointed for three years. At the moment he has no intention of seeking to extend his term beyond 1996. But given Europe's recent turbulent monetary history there is no guarantee that he will avoid adding crisis management to his workload.</p>

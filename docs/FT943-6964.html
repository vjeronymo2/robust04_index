			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / International Company News: Esselte ahead 30% in spite of slow sales Esselte, the Swedish office products group, yesterday reported a 30 per cent rise in pre-tax profits in the first half to SKr180m (Dollars 23.7m), up from SKr138m in the same period last year. This was in spite of only a small increase in sales. The group said the profits growth was produced by a reduction in costs of SKr65m, which more than offset a SKr23m increase in financial expenses to SKr96m, caused by lower hedging benefits. Esselte confirmed its forecast that full-year pre-tax profits in 1994 would exceed last year's SKr301m. Sales in the first half rose 3 per cent to SKr5.89bn from SKr5.7bn. Although Nordic and southern European markets showed growth, sales were lower in the US, the company's biggest country market, and in Germany. However, a turnround in the US, where the company's operations have been restructured, was expected in the second half of the year. The benefits of new products, particularly the new Dymo 1000 electronic labelling tool, were also expected to show through in the latter stages of the year. Divisional results showed the strongest performance for Esselte Dymo, the mainstream office products division, and Esselte Meto. Sales at Esselte Dymo increased to SKr2.2bn from SKr2bn, while operating profits rose to SKr139m from SKr118m. Sales at Esselte Meto, which makes price marking equipment and other products for the retail industry, rose slightly to SKr1.49bn from SKr1.45bn, but operating profits jumped to SKr101m from SKr68m. Esselte Pendaflex, which handles traditional office supplies to the US, Canada and Mexico, North America, pushed up sales to SKr964m from SKr933m and swung to an operating profit of SKr15m from a loss of SKr7m.</p>

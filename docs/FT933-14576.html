			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Quake overshadows Japanese poll: Miyazawa views damage and pledges aid MR KIICHI Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, yesterday flew in to Hakodate on the northern island of Hokkaido to survey nearby damage caused by a strong earthquake and subsequent tidal waves which together claimed 61 lives. Mr Miyazawa, who arrived after campaigning in Nagoya in central Japan for Sunday's general election, had earlier reassured the country that the government would act immediately to assist those affected. Interrupting saturation media coverage of the national election campaign were pictures of smouldering towns and television footage of houses adrift in the ocean. The earthquake off the shore of northern Japan, which registered 7.8 on the Richter scale, was the largest to hit the country since an earthquake of similar magnitude off the Sea of Japan 10 years ago. Tidal waves reaching up to five metres hit Hokkaido as well as the coasts of 10 prefectures in northern Japan, causing extensive damage to local fishing villages and towns. Tidal waves also reached Russia's far east coast, leaving a handful of people missing, damaging fishing vessels and an oil pipeline. In addition to the 61 people reported dead in Japan, 169 were missing, 550 houses collapsed and 385 houses were under water. After shocks continued in the region yesterday and the meteorological agency warned that the danger remained of an after-shock of a magnitude of 6 hitting the region within a month. On Okushiri island, close to the earthquake's epicentre, houses continued to burn last night. More than 300 houses caught fire in the Aonae area of Okushiri alone and a cliff buried a nearby hotel within seconds of collapsing. Residents of Okushiri were moved to a local school and 100 Self Defence Force military personnel were flown in to distribute fresh water and food and help in the rescue. The damage done to towns in Hokkaido is bound to raise fears in Tokyo of a severe earthquake hitting the area in the near future. The Kanto plains, where Tokyo is located, were devastated by a quake in 1923 and studies suggest that another could occur in the not too distant future.</p>

			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / International Company News: Improvement at Marriott MARRIOTT, the US hotels chain, posted net earnings for the year of Dollars 82m or 80 cents a share on sales of Dollars 8.33bn, against earnings of Dollars 47m or 46 cents on sales of Dollars 7.65bn in 1990, writes Karen Zagor. In the fourth quarter, Marriott had net income of Dollars 27m or 25 cents a share on sales of Dollars 2.73bn, compared with a net loss of Dollars 54m or 57 cents on sales of Dollars 2.54bn. But results in both periods were muddied by one-time items and underlying operating profits and net income fell 2 per cent in the 1991 quarter. Marriott said it had held its own despite the impact of recession and the Gulf war. It has reduced its long-term debt by Dollars 400m in the year.</p>

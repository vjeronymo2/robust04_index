			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Pit leasing plan not yet finalised A CONSORTIUM of mine-workers planning to lease British Coal's disused Monktonhall colliery have yet to complete their business plan, in spite of earlier claims to have secured financial backing. British Coal agreed last month to negotiate leasing the colliery near Edinburgh to Monktonhall Mineworkers, a company set up by former British Coal miners and pit managers. It would be the first time British Coal has leased a deep mine. Consortium members have frequently told local newspapers over the past two years that backing for the project from financial institutions was secured. Last month The Scotsman newspaper quoted Mr Jackie Aitchison, chairman of Monktonhall Mineworkers, as saying the bid had the backing of financial institutions such as Royal Bank of Scotland and County NatWest. But Mr Ian Durie of Price Waterhouse, the accountants, who is advising the company, said these statements were incorrect and could be attributed to the miners' financial inexperience. Financial institutions had said they would look at the project when the business plan was complete. Mr Durie said the company had its first meeting with British Coal since the December announcement last week, and had asked for additional information. 'Once we receive that information we will finalise our business plan which will be submitted to potential sources of finance,' he said. 'No offers of funding are in place because we are not in a position to ask institutions for money until the terms are known.' Royal Bank of Scotland said it had examined the project, but stressed that it was not involved in providing financial backing. County NatWest Ventures said it had 'in no way committed itself to financing the company', but would look at the project if the business plan were completed. 3i, the venture-capital group, said it had always made clear it would look at the business plan once it was complete and had been 'devastated' by earlier newspaper reports that it had promised finance.</p>

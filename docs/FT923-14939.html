			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Sport: The selling of an American dream - Olympic Basketball LIKE AN avalanche, the selling of the US Olympic basketball team threatens to bury America's coverage of this summer's Barcelona games under a mountain of hype. It is still three weeks to the Olympic opening ceremony, so Americans have yet to acquaint themselves with most of the sprinters, swimmers and cyclists going to Barcelona. The same cannot be said of the basketball players. It has been impossible these past six months to escape the deluge of publicity about the 12 superstars chosen to go for gold in Barcelona. During the recent professional basketball championship playoffs, the NBC network, which is televising the Olympics, filled its coverage with advertisements, interviews, flattering profiles and punditry about what everyone is inevitably calling the 'Dream Team.' The hype has included a truly offensive cartoon showing mountainous US players stomping all over puny foreign opponents, jokey interviews with team members (including one, Charles Barkley, who said: 'We better win the gold medal, or else we won't get any more endorsement deals'), and endless paeans to the achievements of the stars such as Earvin 'Magic' Johnson and Michael 'Air' Jordan. There have also been acres of coverage in the press, and a blitz of advertising by the team's 13 official corporate sponsors (among them McDonald's, Quaker Oats and Visa) which between them will spend Dollars 40m (Pounds 21m) boasting about their connection to USA Basketball. Millions more will be spent by the makers of the sneakers and sports clothing the players wear. There has been little mention of the opponents the US may face, or of the Dream Team's chances of success. This is because it is painfully obvious that the US will walk away with the gold medal, no matter who they play. In the past, the US has sent university players to the Olympics, where they have usually won (nine golds out of 11 so far) with relative ease. In 1989, however, the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) voted overwhelmingly to allow professionals into the Olympics. The idea was to improve the standards of world basketball by allowing everyone to compete against the best, yet it was accepted at the time that it would be years - decades, probably - before any country matched the US depth of talent. The Olympics will show just how wide the gulf is. In the last five Olympics in which the US has competed, it has won 37 of 39 games. And that was with college players, not the thoroughbreds who will play in Barcelona. As Michael Jordan said to Playboy magazine recently: 'When you look at the talent and the teams we're supposed to play against, it's a massacre. It should never be close . . . Who's going to beat us? The Japanese? The Chinese?' Unlike other Olympic sports, where selections are made just before the games to ensure the competitors chosen are those in the best form, the US basketball team was named last September. The early start provided lots of time to hype the Dream Team. This was especially important to NBC, which paid Dollars 401m for the rights to show the Barcelona games. At a time when sports has been bad business for TV, NBC knows that the US basketball team will be the most popular draw this summer. The NBA - the most successful marketing organisation in world sport - also stands to benefit greatly from the Dream Team. By cranking up the publicity so early, it can spread more of the basketball gospel around the globe. The glamorous US team will also help sell more of the merchandise that each year brings in hundreds of millions of dollars to the NBA and its teams. As the president of the NBA sponsorship and licensing agency said recently: 'This will be the most concentrated marketing exposure any national governing board has ever received, for any sport.' If the early choice of the squad was to give the hype-merchants a head start, the selection of the players was also designed to make the job of the salesmen easier. By any measure, it was the most marketable - not necessarily the most in-form - players who were picked. This explains why the US will be represented this summer by Magic Johnson, who had retired from basketball because he has the HIV virus, and Larry Bird, an ageing superstar whose bad back restricted him to a few largely ineffectual appearances late in the season. While the two have contributed hugely to the popularity of basketball in the US, neither can remotely be described as among the best dozen current US players. But both were obvious choices, on sentimental, as well as commercial, grounds. Even the selection of the token college player smacked of expediency. Instead of picking the outstanding performer in the college game, Shaquille O'Neal of Louisiana State University, the selectors chose Christian Laettner of Duke University. In a squad already dominated by black players, the colour of Laettner's skin (white) may have had more to do with his selection than his skill, which is considerable, but some way short of O'Neal's. Laettner, however, is just a member of the chorus line, as are most of the others in the squad. The star, and the player the NBA hopes will sell basketball to the world, is Michael Jordan, the most charismatic athlete in US sport. Like everyone else, Jordan knows what the Olympics mean to the bottom line. Initially reluctant to give up his normal summer routine of all-day golf, Jordan eventually agreed to join the team, no doubt aware that his presence in Barcelona could prove rewarding financially. This year he is expected to earn about Dollars 13m from corporate endorsement deals. This is a conservative estimate. Include his involvement in the Olympics and the attendant worldwide exposure, and Jordan's earnings could rocket. Not surprisingly, everyone involved is hoping Jordan remains in good health. As New York Times columnist George Vecsey wrote in a report on a recent NBA playoff match: 'When Jordan tripped on a photographer and hobbled back on to the court with a sprained ankle, one could smell the fear from the network (NBC), the league (NBA) and the International Olympic Committee, for whom he is the ultimate meal ticket.' The key to why the NBA, NBC and the corporate sponsors riding the basketball bandwagon so love the Dream Team is summed up in two words dear to any businessman's heart: success guaranteed. The US is going to win. Everyone knows it. Even better, the US is going to be seen thrashing the best the world can put up. For a country that is deeply unsure of itself, Olympic basketball will offer a comforting display of US might. As one television commentator put it after the Dream Team's ludicrous 79-point win over Cuba in the regional qualifying round: 'Those who loved Grenada would love this.'</p>

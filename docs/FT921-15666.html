			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / Islamic party leader claims Algerian army is deployed A LEADER of Algeria's Islamic fundamentalists, poised for election victory, said yesterday the armed forces had been deployed in strength throughout the country over the last 24 hours, Reuter reports from Algiers. Mr Abdelkader Hachani, leader of the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) announced that he had 'received reports from all regions, saying that the army and security forces have deployed in force since last night.' There was no immediate official comment. Diplomats said at the weekend that tanks and other units moved into positions around the capital last Thursday, a week after the FIS took a commanding lead in the first round of elections. 'We want to know what justification there is for this deployment. If it is because of the second round, why have they deployed in regions where seats were decided at the first poll?' Hachani asked. FIS deputies took 188 seats in the first round, just 28 short of a parliamentary majority, and are well placed for the second round on January 16, which will decide the remaining 199. Mr Hachani said there was no sign the government was preparing for the second round, which is only seven days away. 'There is no action which proves that the government is preparing for the second round. The government has taken no measures to organise the election,' he said. 'Up to today the number of candidates is not ready, the method of voting is not clear, or how the elections will be controlled. Even the form of the voting forms is unknown. 'We have asked the government for all this but received no reply,' he said. Candidates have, however, been allocated time on radio and television to broadcast their campaign messages. Eight parties are in the run-off, dominated by the FIS and the former ruling National Liberation Front (FLN). Francis Ghiles adds: Mr Hocine Ait Ahmed, the leader of the Front des Forces Socialistes, the main lay opposition party, said that he found the eventuality of a military takeover 'very difficult to believe'. He said he thought the deployment was a cautionary move before a decision, expected next Saturday, from the Constitutional Court on allegations of fraud in 145 constituencies. In spite of the troop movements and the extreme tone of some of the FIS language - posters went up in Algiers declaring that the party would 'propagate Islamic faith at home and abroad by persuasion (Al Targhib) or by terror (Al Tarbib) - the mood in the capital was remarkably calm. Algiers radio and the dozen or so newspapers published every day are full of arguments, insults and analyses - the sort of mix one would expect during a hotly-contested campaign in many western countries.</p>

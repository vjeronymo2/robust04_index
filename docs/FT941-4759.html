			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Bundesbank allows repo rate fall The Bundesbank yesterday sanctioned another modest decline in the repo rate, signalling that the trend towards cheaper credit in Germany was still intact. The Bundesbank allowed its key securities repurchase rate to fall to 5.94 per cent, from 5.97 per cent last week. Rates in Belgium edged lower soon after the German move, with the Belgian National Bank cutting its central rate to 6.15 per cent from 6.25 per cent. The Bundesbank's repo rate was cut to 5.97 per cent last week after the central bank had held it steady at 6 per cent since early December last year. Financial markets had been hoping for a slightly steeper cut in the repo rate, to as low as 5.90 per cent, and German stock and bond prices initially eased on the news. But money market dealers said the small rate cut had reassured the market the Bundesbank would carry on slowly reducing the cost of borrowing.</p>

			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Women face benefit inequality A TOTAL of 50,000 women pensioners are unlikely to receive invalidity benefit at the same level as men until the pension age is equalised, although this may take many years, the government said yesterday. The Department of Social Security is to challenge a ruling by the Social Security Commission, the independent judicial body, that the government is in breach of a European Community directive on equal treatment. The commission ruled that the government discriminates against 60-year-old women who face cuts in their invalidity benefit whereas men receive the full amount until they are 65.</p>

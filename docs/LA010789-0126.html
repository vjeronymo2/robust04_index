			<p><P> January 7, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: RETAILING;  </P> <P> MANAGEMENT OF HEIDI'S FROGEN YOZURT SAYS FIRM IS VIABLE DESPITE LAWSUITS  </P> <P> Heidi's Frogen Yozurt Shoppes has been hit by a flurry of lawsuits from  creditors who say they hold overdue bills.  </P> <P> But Brian Pallas, executive vice president of Heidi's, said this week that the  Laguna Hills-based chain is a viable company that "looks forward to a bright  future."  </P> <P> "I feel like we're a prime piece of meat floating in the ocean and there are  sharks all around," Pallas said. "A lot of people are rooting for us, but a lot  of manipulative people are trying to take us down for greed."  </P> <P> And notwithstanding the latest spate of lawsuits, Pallas contends that Heidi's  "is turning the corner."  </P> <P> The legal actions seek repayment of overdue taxes, back rent and overdue debts.  </P> <P> The county treasurer's office, for example, filed a delinquency notice late  last month for two bills totaling $234.53.  </P> <P> The landlord of Heidi's corporate offices, Metropolitan Life Insurance, has  sued the yogurt chain for 6 weeks of back rent. Carlsberg Resources Corp. has  filed a case against Heidi's for unpaid rent on warehouse space in Costa Mesa.  And Marilyn Wallar of Irvine has sued a Heidi's subsidiary and company  executives Heidi A. Miller and Pallas for more than $32,000 allegedly due on  two loans.  </P> <P> According to Pallas, however, the lawsuits are "negotiating tactics" brought by  creditors who are worried about losing their money. "I'm negotiating with  creditors . . . (but) everybody's pulling the trigger," he said.  </P> <P> Pallas said he believes that the county treasurer's bill has been paid.  Metropolitan Life, he said, has been told that Heidi's is considering a move to  smaller headquarters as "part of working out a business plan." While he doesn't  deny that the money is owed, he views the lawsuit as "a negotiating tactic."  </P> <P> Carlsberg Resources "wants us out" because the lease for warehouse space is  undervalued, Pallas said. And Wallar, who did advertising work for Heidi's, is  still owed about $32,000 but already has been paid most of what she charged for  her services, he said.  </P> <P> "It's a known fact that we're undercapitalized," Pallas said. But "we're not  the only ones who are beleaguered. A lot of people are trying to scramble out  of our business."  </P> <P> Tough competition in the industry and negative press over Heidi's financial  woes and problems with its franchisees have intensified Heidi's problems.  Pallas said. It also has brought a tendency among creditors to file lawsuits  against Heidi's to ensure protection of the creditors' interests, he said.  </P> <P> Heidi's has a tentative agreement to merge with Steve's Homemade Ice Cream of  New York.  </P></p>

Answering a question by a reporter on China's stand if the  issue is submitted to the Security Council of the United  Nations, the premier said that if the method of pressure is  used, it will only make things more complicated, and make the  situation on the Korean peninsula tense, and that will not be  good for the peace and stability of the region.</p>

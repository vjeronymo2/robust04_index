On 28 February 1991 Colonel I. Yermakov, chief of  an aviation repair plant of the USSR Naval Aviation, was  released from his position in accordance with Decree No 1010 of  the USSR Council of Ministers for his term of office as a  deputy, during which he was to remain on active duty on the  Black Sea Fleet personnel roster. Since the moment of release  from his position, Colonel I. Yermakov has been considered to be  a member of the RF Navy, he did not take the Ukrainian oath, and  he has not expressed a desire to serve in the Ukrainian Armed  Forces.    On the basis of the above, on 20 January of this year  Admiral  Eduard Baltin, commander of the Black Sea Fleet, signed an order  placing Colonel I. Yermakov at his disposal. The chief of the  personnel department of the Black Sea Fleet was instructed to  find a position for RF Navy Aviation Colonel I. Yermakov in  accordance with his wishes and his military specialty.    The command of the Black Sea Fleet and the Russian Ministry  of Defense intend to display concern for the fate of each  officer in the future as well.    A corresponding telegram to the Russian Federation Minister  of Defense was drafted.  <H6>  * * * </H6>   Black Sea Fleet Commander Admiral Edward Baltin received a  telegram from Georgian Republic Security Minister I.

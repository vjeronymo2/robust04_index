			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, April 14 (TANJUG) -- Vice-President of the  Bosnian Serb Republic (R.S.) Biljana Plavsic on Thursday said  that all persons who had approved the NATO air strikes against  the R.S. must be excluded from the further consultations on the  resumption of the peace talks for the former Yugoslav republic  of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    "General Rose is a persona non grata on the territory held  by  the R.S. army. He simply must leave. His departure would be  one of the Serb side's three conditions for the resumption of  the talks," Plavsic said on Radio Jagodina (town in central  Serbia).    The other two conditions on which the R.S. insists have been  presented by R.S. President Radovan Karadzic, and they are the  lifting of sanctions against the Serb people and the signing of  a peace agreement for all of Bosnia-Herzegovina territory,  Plavsic said.    Asked to comment the report from New York that the Sarajevo  formula should be applied in the case of Gorazde, too, Plavsic  said that "the Serb side categorically rejects a Sarajevo  formula which would be applied in Gorazde, because the situation  is not the same." "The Serbs will not accept the Sarajevo model  for Gorazde," she underscored.    U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) Commander for  Bosnia-Herzegovina, British General Michael Rose on Sunday  requested that NATO aircraft raid Bosnian Serb positions around  Gorazde, a U.N.-protected "safe area" in eastern  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    U.S. NATO aircraft raided Bosnian Serb positions around  Gorazde on Sunday and Monday, under the pretext of protecting  UNPROFOR members.    Before the air strikes were launched, the Muslim side had  accused the Serbs of attacking civilian targets in Gorazde,  while the Serbs insisted that the Muslims were using the town of  Gorazde for attacks on Serb positions. Gorazde should have been  demilitarized last spring as a U.N.-protected "safe area."    UNPROFOR representatives, for their part, had confirmed that  the fighting in the area of Gorazde had been provoked by the  Muslim side.    "The U.N. decision to bomb the army and civilians in the  R.S.  is an act of aggression on the R.S. We were aware that UNPROFOR  was aiding the Muslims since July 1992, when we were forbidden  to use Sarajevo airport to transport our wounded. However, now  that we have been bombed, too, both the politicians and the army  must realize that the U.N. peace-keepers are enemies of the Serb  people," Plavsic said.    "The case of Gorazde has shown from the international aspect  that the agreements between Western powers and Russia are not  being respected. Only consent was asked of Great Britain, while  it appears that nobody had consulted Russia at all," the R.S.  vice- president set out.    General Rose continues saying that the R.S. army has stopped  outside Gorazde and that there is no more shooting, all in an  effort to prove that air raids are an effective method, Plavsic  said.    She set out that she left Gorazde on Wednesday night  strongly  convinced that the raiding of the Bosnian Serb positions had  strengthened the Bosnian Serb troops in their determination to  defend every inch of R.S. territory and the conviction that the  U.N. peace-keepers were now an enemy of the Serb people.    "It is up to the international community to evaluate the  success of the aggression," Plavsic said.</p>

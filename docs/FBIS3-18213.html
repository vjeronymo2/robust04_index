U.S. President Bill Clinton said Monday [28 February] that  NATO jets issued two warnings before shooting down four Serb  warplanes over Bosnia and said every attempt was made to "avoid  this encounter."    Ataman told the ANATOLIA Agency that Turkey has taken  initiatives to provide a peaceful, just and lasting solution in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    He said Turkey supported all NATO resolutions made toward  this end and believes that these resolutions should be enforced.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] On 30 March, a plan emerged among the ruling  coalition parties to set up a "vision study group" to replace  the "policy study group" proposed by Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa, but which was withdrawn due to opposition from the  Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] and Sakigake  [Harbinger]. According to several senior ruling coalition party  officials, the plan to set up a new study group is aimed at  coordinating various parties' basic policies regarding such  general topics as constitutional issues and ideas about how  Japan ought to be as a nation. They hope to set up the study  group in April.    Former Labor Minister Toshio Yamaguchi (independent), who is  one of the original proponents of the policy study group, is  playing a major role in working out plans for the new group.  Partial changes in the prospectus originally drawn up for the  policy study group are planned. Changes are to include the  removal of topics such as that calling for selecting "unified  candidates" in preparation for future national elections and  that for cooperation among the ruling coalition parties geared  toward "formation of a new new party." In addition, study  subjects are to be changed to more generalized topics instead of  specific areas, and participation in the study group is to be on  an individual basis, as a rule.    On the morning of 30 March, Yamaguchi met SDPJ Chairman  Tomiichi Murayama at the lower house official residence.  Yamaguchi explained the new plan and sought his understanding.  However, Murayama said he believed it is more important to  resume Diet deliberations on the fiscal 1994 draft national  budget.</p>

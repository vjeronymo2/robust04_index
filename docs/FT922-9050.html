			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Property: A move to eternal values ARE YOU looking for an old rectory? And hoping to buy it immediately the parson moves out? You will find unexpected snags and attractions, and a delightful bonus under a law passed 216 years ago. The usual rectory is a solid 18th or 19th century house, reflecting how the vicar stood in society. Some fine specimens are even Edwardian. It will probably be in the heart of the village, which is a boon for getting help and for deliveries, because everybody will know where you live. There will be plenty of bedrooms, larders and outbuildings, and you can be sure of at least three decent reception rooms. (The parson needed a study to write his sermons.) It is not surprising that rectories have been so popular. The Church has been selling them hard since the 1960s, but by now it has very few such properties left. If one does come up, give it special attention, even if it looks a mess and the garden is a jungle. It is bound to need painting, but the fabric should be sound - thanks to the Church's system of five-year inspections. And, as the first private buyer, you have a rare chance to re-do it and put in bathrooms the way you want, rather than suffer some intervening owner's 'improvements.' Do not get upset if negotiations take time. The church is an institution for eternity, which is how it sees its investments and its property. Furthermore, the house could be sold with more restrictions than you expected, although these are hardly likely to impede you. You will almost certainly be forbidden to turn it into a pub, or to make noise during services in the church next door. And you probably will not be allowed to call it the Old Rectory. The usual reason given is that people seeking counsel may come to the wrong house (although only three lots of giggling couples came in the early years to our former rectory - they wanted me to marry them). In pre-poll tax days, parsonages were re-rated when they went private. Something similar will happen with the council tax. Our rateable value went up eight times, which affected the water bill. If there is a meter, it could pay to negotiate to keep it and be ahead of the crowd when meters become mandatory in a few years. If you buy glebe land for a pony paddock, beware of a hazard called chancel repair liability. Glebe is land used by the parson to supplement his income, either by letting it or working it himself. Since before the Reformation, the owner of the glebe has had a duty to pay for repairs to the church's chancel. In effect, the parson paid to maintain his holy bit of the church at the east end with the altar. This arcane liability can pass to any succeeding owner, although it is most unlikely that any parochial church council will invoke it. But because it is a charge on the owner, and not on the land, it will not show up in normal searches. The Law Commission recommended that the liability be repealed but the lord chancellor's department has still to decide if it will introduce legislation. In the meantime, it might be wise not to raise the matter, as the parson and church council may be unaware of the liability. If you are worried, though, go to church and see what you might be letting yourself in for. If the chancel looks in bad shape, suggest your solicitor seeks an indemnity against liability from the diocesan board that will be handling the Church's negotiations. The good news is the Ecclesiastical Residences Act 1776. It says says that when a rectory moves from Church to private domain, you do not have to pay stamp duty. Finally, when you complete the sale, the parson will sign as the vendor  - because what you have just bought is, by long custom of the church, the parson's freehold.</p>

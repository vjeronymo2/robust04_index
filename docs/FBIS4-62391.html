			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow 16 May -- Military experts believe that the  defense budget, whose first reading has been approved by the  State Duma, may effectively deprive Russia of its strategic  nuclear forces (SNF), which could in turn call in question the  need to comply with the international START I and START II  Treaties.    They feel that if funding remains fixed at the level of 1993  and the first quarter of this year, meeting only 10 percent of  the SNF's requirements, then by the year 2000 the strategic  missile forces (SMF) will have only 90 launch facilities left at  their disposal.    Three years after that there will be none left at all. So,  the whole point of complying with the stipulations of the START  I Treaty and of ratifying START II will have been lost. The  aims of these documents, which set out parameters for reduction  of strategic offensive armaments, will have been achieved and  exceeded "automatically."    Colonel General Vasiliy Vorobyev, head of the main  directorate for the military budget and funding of the Russian  Defense Ministry, told ITAR-TASS today that the funds earmarked  for the Defense Ministry are scarcely enough to settle debts for  electricity, food, property services, and municipal charges. He  said that the payment of debts for supplies of equipment and  armaments was also in doubt. There is no funding for research  and development work, including research in areas regarded as  crucial to national security.    Military experts are of the view that the budget should be  adjusted in order to ensure that Russia remains a nuclear power  and does not lose its status. When defense spending comes up  for consideration in the State Duma for a second time, it would  be expedient, they say, to take account of the need to maintain  nuclear parity as the main guarantee of the state's national  security. In accordance with the international treaties, by the  year 2000 Russia should have 900 SMF launch facilities. The  aviation component of the SNF should have 900 weapons and the  naval component 1,700. In line with the treaty, the total  number of Russian nuclear warheads should be 3,500. This is  rather fewer than the United States, but wholly sufficient to  deter a potential enemy. This provision is enshrined in the new  military doctrine and corresponds to the interests of national  security.</p>

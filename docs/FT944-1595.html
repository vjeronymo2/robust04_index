			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Survey of Sweden (17): Master of its own destiny - Profile: Kalmar Industries Recent events at Kalmar Industries, based at Ljungby in southern Sweden, provide a classic example of the changes that Swedish industry has undergone as it grappled with recession and aimed to increase its productivity and competitiveness. The company is the world's largest producer of heavy lift trucks - the kind that can pick up and stack huge laden shipping containers - and also makes sideloaders and light- and medium-sized lift trucks (forklifts). It has 500 workers at Ljungby and 250 at nearby Lidhult, where Sweden's first lift trucks were developed at the end of the 1940s - with the help, initially, of a local blacksmith. Its biggest Swedish competitor in heavy lift-trucks, Svetruck, is also based in Ljungby. Since 1990, restructuring has dominated the agenda at Kalmar. It has reduced the worldwide workforce by 27 per cent to 1,150, with the bulk of the cuts outside Sweden. Production of Irion sideloaders was moved last year from a plant near Stuttgart to Sweden, involving the loss of 180 jobs in Germany. In the UK, where Kalmar bought Coventry-Climax in 1987, production of the Climax range of light trucks for the UK market was discontinued in 1992, and is now outsourced to US and Japanese suppliers. At home, emphasis has focused on boosting productivity. Absenteeism has been sharply reduced, co-operation between unions and management has replaced confrontation, teamwork and flexibility are the buzzwords. Bringing manufacturing back to Sweden from Germany was thus a sign of confidence in the ability to manufacture competitively at Ljungby - helped, naturally, by the devaluation of the krona in late 1992. It also helped fill spare capacity caused by the recession, which prompted a sharp fall in demand in a number of important product and geographic markets. Worldwide sales fell from SKr1.62bn in 1990 to SKr1.36bn in 1992, turning a profit of SKr59m, after financial items, into a loss of SKr34m. There was an improvement last year, especially on the heavier side of the business, and sales of SKr1.6bn produced a profit of SKr34m after financial items. So, in mid-January, when Mr Jonas Svantesson joined the company as president and chief executive, he found it in good shape. 'A lot of restructuring had been done, and the workers' loyalty and ambition was very strong,' he says. 'I thought that if everyone could be pointed in the same direction, it had enormous potential.' Just two months after Mr Svantesson arrived at Kalmar, he was told that its then owner, Svedala, planned to dispose of the company. In late spring, the lift truck producer was floated on the Stockholm Stock Exchange, and now has some heavyweight UK institutions among its shareholders. The change in status is seen as a new beginning for Kalmar, which became caught up in some of the big recent corporate deals in Sweden and was often too small a part of its parent companies' business to be given much priority. Procordia, the former state-affiliated holding company, sold then loss-making Kalmar to the engineering group Componenta in 1989, but Componenta was itself purchased by Svedala two years later. Mr Svantesson welcomes Kalmar's new freedom to make decisions as master of its own destiny, without having to refer them to a parent company. Workers' loyalty to the success of the company is now much greater, he says, and in any case some of the expected synergies between Svedala and Kalmar had not materialised. The flotation has come against a backdrop of much better financial performance, with profits of SKr110m after financial items for the first nine months of the year, compared with just SKr10m a year earlier. Improved profitability has spruced up the balance sheet, with net debt falling from SKr275m at the end of last year to SKr67m. The light and medium sized truck business has improved sharply, catching up with the heavy side, but there is still room for further improvement. For the future, Mr Svantesson's strategy for Kalmar is to keep it in lift-trucks, seeking protection from some of the vagaries of the market by building a balanced business rather than diversifying out of materials handling. First, he wants to build up the non-cyclical parts of the business. Already, 50 per cent of Kalmar's turnover relates to container handling, in ports and terminals, which is non-cyclical. The forestry and steel sector markets account for 40 per cent, but are very cyclical. Mr Svantesson has important geographic targets too. North America accounts for 5 per cent of sales, but he aims to grow that to 15 per cent. The company is looking closely at how to expand in the three leading Latin American markets of Brazil, Argentina and Chile, but the big growth prospect is Asia, he says. The region accounts for 13 per cent of sales, but this could grow to 20 per cent, says Mr Svantesson. China's huge planned expansion of port capacity is potentially good news for Kalmar's sales of container-handling lift trucks, but other Asian countries also represent tempting prospects. At present, Kalmar is happy to be manufacturing all its machinery in Sweden, although production in Asia is not ruled out if demand warrants it. With 90 per cent of its sales outside Sweden, the krona's devaluation has helped sales of light and medium-sized trucks, where competitors typically produce in countries with strong currencies such as Japan and Germany. In contrast, Kalmar's competitors on the heavy side are mainly from nations with weak currencies such as Finland, Italy or Sweden itself. Along with many Swedish businessmen, though, Mr Svantesson is in favour of a stronger krona - which would be a sign that the government is grappling with the budget deficit. Also, he notes, 55-60 per cent of the production value of Kalmar's lift trucks products is bought in from suppliers, and half of that comes from abroad. If the krona does rise, Kalmar will have to continue raising productivity to remain competitive in overseas markets. Mr Svantesson makes clear that the company will not be resting on its laurels: further efficiency gains can be made at the Swedish plants through improved production flows and other changes - without huge investments, he says.</p>

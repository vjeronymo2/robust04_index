			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Survey of Chemicals and the Environment (13): Keeping ahead of the game - Profile, Elf-Atochem ACROSS the estuary from Harfleur, where nearly 600 years ago Henry V landed for his Agincourt campaign, dark smoke emerges from one of the stacks at Elf-Atochem's petrochemicals plant at Gonfreville-l'Orcher. Such pollution is an exception to the rule, insists Mr Andre Grosmaitre, director of the site. The complex, consisting of a 470,000-tonne a year ethylene cracker and capacity for manufacturing derivative plastics, has received substantial investment in recent years to reduce and minimise emissions. 'We've cut the site's annual emissions to the air from 25,500 tonnes a year in 1977 to 7,848 tonnes last year. Meanwhile, hazardous waste production, which increased from 4,480 tonnes in 1986 to 10,690 in 1990, has been cut again to 4,550 tonnes. As for liquid emissions, they have been reduced by more than two-thirds since 1981,' claims Mr Grosmaitre. When the local authorities allowed production to increase by 30 per cent in 1990, they insisted emissions should not rise. In fact, they have actually fallen, he points out In spite of such achievements, the group's management has set what it believes are ambitious targets to reduce emissions over the next five years. During that time, it plans to reduce water emissions by 30 per cent, cut production of 17 key wastes by 50 per cent and nitrogen oxide emissions by 25 per cent, and to increase the proportion of hazardous wastes treated within the organisation from 90 to 95 per cent. Such targets are voluntary, but in spite of the cost are highly necessary, says Mr Francis Bazile, board director responsible for the environment. The group worldwide spends about FFr2.4bn a year on the environment. At Gonfreville alone, the company spends FFr20-30m a year on capital projects for safety and the environment, as well as about FFr40m a year on environmental operating expenses. 'If we want permission for a new unit, we have to be ahead of the game, so we make sure we are below the levels insisted on by the local prefecture,' says Mr Grosmaitre. The investment and progress have been made, not directly because of legislation, but rather to head off legislation, explains Mr Grosmaitre. 'We don't want the administration imposing something on us, because it would be unlikely to be the best solution for the environment. We might have to spend a lot of money that would have little impact on the environment,' he says. If the chemical industry is not seen to improve its performance, then there is a danger that unnecessary legislation may be introduced. Recent EC legislation controlling 132 micro-pollutants would make effluent purer than drinking water, he claims. Elf-Atochem's general philosophy is to reduce waste production at source rather than deal with it at the end of the pipe,' says Mr Roger Papp, director of safety and environment at the company. Mr Bazile gives the example of the polystyrene plant at Carling in the department of Moselle where the company introduced a new technology that recycles the waste monomer, eliminating the need to produce aqueous wastes. Much of the effort at Gonfreville has gone into waste minimisation. The halving in the production of hazardous waste was achieved by recycling a byproduct - aluminium chloride - rather than incinerating it, and then using the chemical for cleaning water. 'Our internal surveys show the efforts we have made have paid off. People are proud to be working for the company. They are conscious of the enormous progress we have made,' says Mr Grosmaitre. Externally, progress has also been made, he claims. This has been achieved as much by the improving environmental performance of the complex as by a programme to communicate that improve- ment to the local population. The company campaigns on its own and through a body representing the industrial zone behind Havre where the complex is sited. Mr Grosmaitre explains: 'Three or four years ago we conducted a qualitative opinion poll of attitudes to the industrial zone and the Harvraise population. We found there was a gap in understanding. On the one hand, there were expectations that the industrial zone would take up the slack from the declining port-based industries. But at the same time, there was suspicion about this apparently mysterious universe.' The companies located in the industrial zone launched a newsletter in three local newspapers, explaining what the factories did, and giving details about safety issues. An additional booklet, put together by 26 companies, provided information for youngsters wanting to find employment in the zone. The companies also targeted the local school population. Mr Grosmaitre explains that when you influence a child, you influence the whole family. Visits include showing the site fire-engines putting out blazes and picnics in countryside near the plant. Independently, teachers from all disciplines were invited. The safety of the industrial zone is also stressed. The last serious incident was in 1940, when retreating French forces sabotaged the oil refinery to stop it falling into Axis hands. Mr Grosmaitre reckons a measure of the success of Elf-Atochem's efforts is the lack of difficulties the company had in receiving permission for a FFr2bn extension three years ago. 'We are never finished,' he admits. 'At the moment, the biggest concern in Le Havre is the smell of sulphur from the industrial zone. That's a bigger problem than unemployment, Aids or any other issue, and we will have to deal with it.' The immediate target is to cut sulphur dioxide emissions by 50 per cent within 10 years.</p>

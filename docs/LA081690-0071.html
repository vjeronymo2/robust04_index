			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ASSEMBLY PANEL NEATLY DISPOSES OF DIAPER BILL BY KILLING IT  </P> <P> In politics, community groups fighting projects such as landfills and toxic  dumps are said to be operating on the NIMBY principle -- Not in My Back Yard.  </P> <P> So it was with tongue in cheek that a lobbyist for Huggies diapers this week  suggested that opposition to a measure requiring environmental warnings on  disposable diapers was fueled by a similar desire -- Not Until Mine Is Potty  Trained.  </P> <P> That, along with conflicting claims, led the powerful Assembly Ways and Means  Committee on Tuesday to kill a controversial diaper bill sponsored by Sen. Lucy  Killea (D-San Diego).  </P> <P> Under Killea's proposal, companies such as Procter &amp; Gamble and  Kimberly-Clark would have been required to put stickers on packages of their  disposables by January, 1992, saying, "Environmental warning: Single-use  disposable diapers create significant environmental problems and costs to the  community when disposed."  </P> <P> But the committee scuttled that plan with an 8-6 vote after a heavy lobbying  campaign from the industry, which offered economic and environmental  counterclaims. The measure needed 12 votes to move forward.  </P> <P> Killea said Wednesday she has decided to declare a public information victory  while beating a legislative retreat.  </P> <P> "In a way, the strong opposition gave us a lot more publicity on this very  simple, innocuous bill," said Killea, adding she will not try to revive the  bill this year.  </P> <P> Killea said some parents have approached her to say they intend to switch to  cloth diapers. It is the kind of ecologically motivated behavior that Killea  says she wanted all along with the labels, since the non-biodegradable  throwaways constitute about 2% of the solid wastes packed into landfills each  year -- a volume large enough to create a 10-foot-wide strip on Interstate 5  from Mexico to Oregon.  </P> <P> Disposable-diaper companies, however, said the 2% was not enough to warrant a  label that singled out their product as an environmental hazard. "The whole  objective is to put a user of the product on a guilt trip," said Gene Hill,  Kimberly-Clark's regional director of state government relations.  </P> <P> Killea has a second bill that would require day care centers to give parents  the option of using either cloth or disposable diapers. That bill is still  wending its way through the legislative process.  </P></p>

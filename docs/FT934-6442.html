			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Pension thief gets two years The former chief executive of the collapsed Farr Group construction company was jailed for two years yesterday for stealing Pounds 2m from the company's pension fund, in spite of promising to repay the missing money within three years, John Mason writes. Mr Gerald Smith had been repaying the missing funds from a loan and his earnings as a business consultant, Southwark Crown Court was told. His jail sentence means he will not be able to make any further repayments, leaving the pension fund severely depleted. Passing sentence Judge Laurie said he had to balance the individual interests of pension fund members against the public interest in ensuring dishonest company directors who stole pension fund assets were properly punished. He had decided that the public interest was more important in this case.</p>

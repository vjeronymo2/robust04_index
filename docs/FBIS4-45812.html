			<p>CSO     [Text] The number of nuclear plant workers dying  prematurely from all illnesses, including cancer, is lower than  the national average, according to a report funded by the atomic  energy industry which is published today.    The survey includes information on more than 75,000 people  employed between 1946 and 1982 by the UK Atomic Energy  Authority, the Atomic Weapons Establishment, and British Nuclear  Fuels at Sellafield.    Workers fell into two groups -- those likely to be exposed  to  radiation who were monitored, and those who were not. The second  group included office workers and caterers.    Researchers found deaths from all causes in monitored  workers  were 19 per cent lower than average, while overall deaths from  cancer were 18 per cent lower. By 1989 there were 40,761 workers  in the monitored group, of whom 1,884 had died of cancer.    Dr Valerie Beral, of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund,  said:  "The fact that the number of deaths was lower than average was  not unexpected. This is common in high-skill industries which  tend to employ healthy people."    The cancers most commonly linked with radiation exposure in  previous studies were those of the prostate, uterus, lung, and  multiple myeloma and leukemia. The new analysis showed that only  leukemia was clearly linked with external radiation.    Dr Lucy Carpenter, of Oxford University, said: "The 49  leukemia deaths observed in monitored workers were similar to  the number predicted by general rates but the risk of the  disease rose with the radiation dose in these workers.    "The dose-related risk was confined to those last employed  at  Sellafield, where radiation doses were higher."    Deaths from thyroid cancer were also higher than average --  for every 100 cases expected, 181 were observed. Dr Beral said:  "The increase was found in groups but there was some weak  evidence that the increased risk in monitored workers was linked  to radiation dose. This is being investigated further."</p>

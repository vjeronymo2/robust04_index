			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> A NIGHT OF MUSICAL HORROR AND CRUDITY  </P> <P> If you don't have any ideas, try a gimmick.  </P> <P> That seems to be the principle behind Johnny Monster and the Nightmares. The  San Clemente band has gained some popularity on the local rock circuit by  taking musical styles and a coarse, rowdy attitude that come straight from the  frat house, and relocating them to the haunted house.  </P> <P> The four-member schlock-horror band's show Wednesday night at Club Postnuclear  was a monstrous mishmash, just the sort of mutation of entertainment you get  when a gimmick goes groping around without an idea in its head.  </P> <P> The gimmick, in this case, seems to be to reincarnate the nasty but funny ghoul  of "Beetlejuice" as a farcical rock singer. But achieving that would require a  front man with the imagination and acting ability to forge a true persona  incorporating some snide wit. Acting was beyond Johnny Monster (his real name  is David Paskowitz). Even parody would require more consideration than this  band could muster. About all this Monster could manage was crude horsing  around.  </P> <P> The fact that Paskowitz horses around with a good deal of energy may account  for the band's having found an audience. The wiry singer often jumped onto the  floor with the pit denizens, slam-dancing with abandon as the band thrashed  away punk-style. The physical contact took a more worrisome turn when Paskowitz  pinned a woman in the audience to the floor in imitation of a sexual assault.  All in good fun, right? Just a stage buffoon making like he's Mr. Hyde? Maybe,  but what if the next person Paskowitz tackles doesn't see the joke, the way his  unsuspecting Postnuclear victim apparently did?  </P> <P> The musical side of the routine called for Paskowitz to bellow theatrically in  imitation of Vincent Price while delivering inane verses on mock-ghoulish  themes that got no better than this:  </P> <P>  Going to a lifeless luau  </P> <P>  You're a corpse, you're invited.  </P> <P>  Going to a lifeless luau  </P> <P>  Where the dead get excited.  </P> <P> Paskowitz does have a capacious set of pipes, and he frequently showed off his  lung power with falsetto screams that most heavy-metal bleaters would envy. At  certain moments, he generated some force, leading one to think there might be a  real rock singer underneath all that melodramatic Grand Guignol posing and  mannered B-movie vocal phrasing.  </P> <P> It was hard to tell whether there was potentially a real rock band under the  blanket of stage smoke and sonic murk that tends to envelope Postnuclear. When  audible, guitarist John Fields spun out a tuneless metallic screech, while  drummer Sean Spencer and bassist Shane Anderson played to garage-band standards  on songs that borrowed from surf music and R&amp;B.  </P> <P> Tender Fury was by far the more rewarding band on this double-bill. Singer Jack  Grisham is no stranger to stage gimmickry, dating back to the early 1980s, when  he fronted the original T.S.O.L. (which, incidentally, managed in the  necrophiliac fantasy, "Code Blue," to convey the sort of crude but pointedly  satiric wit that eludes Johnny Monster). Grisham resorted to one of his old  tricks midway through the half-hour set, lowering his pants a la Jim Morrison  to reveal his leopard-spotted underwear. But he quickly hitched up his trousers  and got on with the show.  </P> <P> Grisham's singing was drowned out in a poor mix through most of the show,  emerging only on the last two numbers. While he never has had the bite and  power of a top-grade rock singer, Grisham compensates with personality that  comes through in his theatrical, almost vaudevillian drawl. In the past, he has  sometimes taken shows as a lark, joking his way through performances. But  Grisham, who says he has changed old ways by quitting substance abuse,  performed with focus and intensity.  </P> <P> It was the playing, rather than the singing, that carried this performance.  Hunt Sales, the drummer from David Bowie's band, Tin Machine, kept up a fast,  fiery pace (Sales, who produced Tender Fury's current album, "Garden of Evil,"  has been sitting in as the band's stage drummer since early this year).  Guitarist Daniel Root stayed in step with Sales, churning out hard, slab-like  riffs and feedback-drenched solos. On Tender Fury's two albums, Root excels  with forceful economy. He showed that he could stretch out more prolifically on  stage without becoming diffuse.  </P> <P> The sound mix improved at the end, in time for Tender Fury to finish with two  driving numbers, "Garden of Evil" and "(Desperate) And Looking for the Chip,"  that recalled the Cult in their headlong, insistent throb. Tender Fury  headlined Friday at Bogart's in Long Beach.  </P></p>

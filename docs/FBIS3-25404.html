Addressing a meeting of the  International Press Institute in Cape Town, Ms. de Lille said  the media had blown out of all proportion the white brain drain  as if the whole country would come to a standstill as a result.  Her statement is in contrast to African National Congress  leader Mr. Nelson Mandela's call to whites not to leave the  country.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, 12 Mar (XINHUA) --Qian Qichen, vice premier  and foreign minister, and U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher began their first round of talks here this morning.    Christopher and his party were greeted by Qian Qichen on  their arrival -- by car from the China World Hotel, where they  are staying -- at the Diaoyutai State Guest House's Fang Fei  Garden at exactly 1000 [0200 GMT]. The two foreign ministers  shook hands warmly and exchanged regards.    In warmly welcoming Christopher's visit to Beijing, Qian  Qichen said, "When we met in Paris more than a month ago, I  reiterated my invitation to you to visit China." He pointed  out: Our talks in Paris went very well. Qian Qichen said that  he was looking forward to exchanging views with him on Sino-U.S.  relations and other issues.    In thanking Qian Qichen for his welcome, Christopher said he  has found that Beijing has changed a lot in the past decade.    Christopher arrived in Beijing yesterday evening together  with his 110-odd delegation, which includes his wife, Mary  Christopher; Madame Davis, assistant secretary of state for  international security affairs [title as received]; and Frank  Wisner, under secretary of defense [for policy].    Beijing is the last leg of Christopher's 10-day,  three-nation  Asia-Pacific tour. This is a relatively high-level Sino-U.S.  contact since the leaders of the two countries met in Seattle  last November and is the second meeting between Qian Qichen and  Christopher since they met in Paris on 24 January.    Christopher, who is 69 and the senior U.S. diplomat, was  assistant secretary of state for the Carter administration. He  assumed the post of secretary of state for the Clinton  administration in January 1993. He is prudent and is not fond  of contacts with the media. His speciality is "shadowboxing  using words."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nadav Shragay] </F>   [Text] The Jerusalem Municipality wants to create an line  of Jewish contiguity between Wadi al-Jawz and Mount Scopus in  the eastern part of town. Instructions in that spirit were  transmitted to the town's Planning Department for plans to be  prepared to be presented to the local planning and construction  committee.    The town hall wants to advance these plans with the  Construction and Housing Ministry, and the two have held  discussions on the matter, but have not reached any practical  conclusions.    In several months, the Border Police will evacuate its  headquarters from the Shpaer Hotel located near this area. The  hotel is currently being leased to the Border Police by Jewish  financier Erwin Moscowitz, patron of 'Ateret Hakohanim Yeshiva.  Moscowitz will probably operate a hotel at the site, which will  become part of the Jewish area the municipality is planning.    Jerusalem Deputy Mayor Shmu'el Me'ir yesterday called on  Construction and Housing Minister Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer to hold  up the plan to build 72 housing units for Arabs. The ministry  is about to present a plan to Jerusalem's Regional Council for  Planning and Construction. Under the plan, a neighborhood and  several public buildings will be build on the southern slopes of  Mount Scopus.    Me'ir claims that the neighborhood is being planned on an  important traffic axis -- the road cutting across Mount Scopus  -- and its establishment could harm security. He also said that  the site meant for an Arab neighborhood is located on the  southern slopes of Mount Scopus and that the area is supposed to  constitute a green belt encircling the hill. The deputy mayor  also claims that a cemetery dating from biblical times is  situated there.    The Jerusalem Municipality made it clear yesterday that  despite Waqf protests, preparatory work will continue on the  Avshalom sentinel on the Ophel path near Lions' Gate. The East  Jerusalem Development Company, in cooperation with the  municipality and the Tourism Ministry, is setting up lookouts at  several sites in the area. A fence is being built and the road  is being expanded as part of the work. The Waqf heads claim  that the area belongs to them while the municipality says that  the plan has the approval of local and regional committees and  that the area was legally appropriated.    Egypt's Ambassador Muhammad Basyuni yesterday cabled the  Foreign Ministry on the issue, and the Waqf heads called on  international bodies for assistance in preventing Israel from  setting up a tourism project within the walls of the Old City.    Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert said "it is inconceivable that  Waqf officials should try to dictate to the Jerusalem  Municipality not to pave a road in an area which has Jewish and  historical value and which will serve the population and  tourists.    [Tel Aviv DAVAR in Hebrew on 24 June in a page-2 article  quotes Ofir Pines, Labors' coordinator of activities, in a  letter to the state controller as saying that "there is  increasing involvement by Jerusalem Municipality in activities  opposed to the peace process." Pines notes that "the  municipality assisted in the establishment of the settlers'  protest outside the Prime Minister's Office, provided it with  water and electricity, and are involved in organizing right-wing  demonstrations."]</p>

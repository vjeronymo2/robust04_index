			<p><P> March 3, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE;  </P> <P> 'POLES' TO BE MOVED FROM CIVIC CENTER  </P> <P> An artist agreed Friday to remove her work from the Civic Center plaza after  city officials declared it a safety hazard. The piece, "Wavering Poles," is  part of an exhibit by 10 Orange County artists which opened Thursday and  continues for four months.  </P> <P> The sculpture will be moved to the Fountain Valley headquarters of FHP  Healthcare for the duration of the exhibition period. The Irvine exhibit  consists of work by artists who were finalists in a competition sponsored by  FHP last year.  </P> <P> The artist, Angie Bray of Laguna Beach, said she is concerned that viewers  won't be able to "see the piece functioning" at the new location, "but at least  it will have some sort of (attractive) setting." City officials had threatened  to move the piece into the Civic Center building, even though Bray designed it  to be seen out-of-doors.  </P> <P> "Wavering Poles" is a cluster of slender, upright aluminum poles in graduated  heights, mounted so that they can sway in the breeze. According to Community  Services Department employees, the city's risk management and liability staff  was concerned that the beveled tops of the poles could injure anyone who yanked  on them. At FHP, the public will not be able to touch the poles.  </P> <P> Stanchions and police barrier tape surrounded the delicate-looking piece in  Irvine on Friday.  </P> <P> Toni McDonald, the city's cultural affairs superintendent, said there was a  "misunderstanding" about who was responsible for inspecting "Wavering Poles."  She said one inspector initially passed the work, based on a diagram Bray  submitted, but another inspector rejected it.  </P> <P> McDonald had given Bray the alternative of placing the work inside the Civic  Center, against a wall and separated from the public by a fence. But the artist  declined because the work was specifically made for the outdoor site. "The  point of the piece is what it does there," Bray said. "It responds to air  currents, and to the harmonic resonance from the huge helicopters that hover  around there all day. Depending on how far or how close (the aircraft are), a  different pole quivers."  </P> <P> Initially, Bray bridled at the idea of moving the piece at all. "I'm not going  to say I disagree about the danger or that I (want to) impose this piece" on  the public, she said. "I understand they (the city officials) don't have much  experience in public art. But they have a responsibility to take seriously the  work they accept and to think ahead" by scrutinizing the diagram she submitted  for potential safety problems. "If they don't, then they do have an obligation  to the person who did the work."  </P> <P> Bray originally designed a different piece, a fence made of flexible bamboo  poles, which was to be placed on the Civic Center lawn. (The illustrated  brochure for the Irvine exhibit shows a model of that sculpture rather than the  one actually in place.) But when Ann Thorne, the city's public art consultant,  told Bray the lawn irrigation system might damage the poles, she was asked to  make a piece for the courtyard instead. CATHY CURTIS  </P></p>

			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Brittan postpones EC car price study SIR LEON BRITTAN, the European Community's competition commissioner, yesterday postponed publication of his controversial and long-awaited study of EC car prices for at least a week under pressure from his fellow commissioners, including Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president. Publication of a parallel study of the EC motor industry will almost certainly go ahead after Mr Martin Bangemann, the industry commissioner, agreed to make changes to his text. The wrangling over the two documents is the latest episode in the dispute between Sir Leon and Mr Bangemann over why car prices differ substantially across the EC, and how they can be brought into line. The internal debate in Brussels reflects a fierce Community-wide battle between manufacturers and consumer groups over the best way of reconciling an open market in cars and high standards of safety and service. The study prepared for Sir Leon, the method of which is likely to be challenged by EC car manufacturers when it appears, indicates that car prices differ by as much as 40 per cent between some EC countries. Germany and Spain had the greatest number of high price models in 1988, while in January 1989 the highest price models were concentrated in the UK. Spain had by far the greatest number of high price models in the three study periods in 1990 and 1991. Sir Leon and Commission competition officials lay most of the blame for the discrepancies on the 'selective distribution' system of exclusive car dealerships, which restricts the sales of new cars in the Community to dealers chosen by the manufacturers. The system, which has also been attacked by consumer groups, is sheltered from EC competition rules until 1995. Mr Bangemann and his advisers agree that specific abuses of the system should be punished, but say there are other reasons for the differences in prices. They argue that the exclusive dealership system could be maintained in some form for a further four years after 1995. This would be partly to protect EC manufacturers from indirect imports of Japanese cars, which will be allowed full access to the European market from the end of 1999. It is these passages which have caused friction with Sir Leon. 'We have offered to take the car price paper a bit later, on the basis that selective distribution is left neutral in the Bangemann text, so that it doesn't close any options,' one of Sir Leon's advisers said yesterday.

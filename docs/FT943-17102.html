			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Go-ahead for more Russian asset sales: Next stage of privatisation aims to attract large investors into companies The Russian cabinet yesterday approved the second phase of the privatisation of Russian state property - the massive programme of asset sales which has already seen the largest part of that property pass out of state hands in exchange for vouchers issued free to the country's 150m people. The transition from the first to the second phase is a messy one, dictated by the need to soak up the estimated 3m-9m vouchers of the 148m issued for the first phase but still not exchanged for shares. President Boris Yeltsin has decreed that workers can, in certain conditions, still exchange vouchers for shares until the end of this month; while Mr Yuri Luzhkov, the Moscow mayor, has decreed that Muscovites can exchange their unused vouchers, estimated to number around 220,000, for certificates which can collect interest at the Savings Bank. The next stage, proposed by Mr Anatoly Chubais, the privatisation minister, and approved by his colleagues yesterday, is aimed at attracting large investors into the companies - both those still to be sold and those already privatised. To make the process more attractive, Mr Chubais said yesterday that the second stage of the programme would include a provision to allow enterprises to acquire the land on which they were situated and to sell excess land on the market. This provision is certain to increase their value greatly. However, the draft government decree now being finalised by officials from the state property committee and the justice ministry must still be signed by the president - and will not be discussed by the state duma (lower house) for some time. Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, told the Interfax news agency he feared the presidential decree would differ from the law likely to be passed by the duma. Right- and left-wing groups in the duma have already sponsored a motion on privatisation which would effectively halt the second stage. A poll conducted for the 'Mnenie' (Opinion) polling organisation in Moscow earlier this week showed that the majority polled viewed privatisation as a process which benefited the rich and powerful, gave foreigners control of Russian companies, threatened jobs and put up prices. Mr Chubais' advisers acknowledge the amount of progress still to be made, but are satisfied that the first round has broken the power of the old ministries over the bulk of post-Soviet enterprises. The partial nature of privatisation so far was demonstrated yesterday when a senior official of United Energy Systems, the enterprise which groups together the 69 regional energy suppliers in Russia, announced that some 16 per cent of the company had been sold in two series of public auctions in March and June.</p>

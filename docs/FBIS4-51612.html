			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 2 (YONHAP) -- South Korean President Kim  Yong-sam on Monday ordered an around-the-clock alert against  North Korean military movements and harmonious policy-making  under the new unification minister.    Kim issued the directives at a breakfast meeting with  members  of the Unification-National Security Policy Coordination Council  that was established on his orders last month, his senior aide  Chong Chong-ok said.    He asked the military to be on constant alert against events  like an increase in the frequency of North Korean military  exercises, while emphasizing that the council should seek to  formulate policies in unison under new Deputy  Premier-Unification Minister Yi Hong-ku.    One inside source described what he said were North Korea's  attempts to disband the Military Armistice Commission (MAC).    North Korean members to the MAC Secretariat had been on  resident duty but Pyongyang withdrew them as of April 29, the  source said, an indication that it is trying to nullify the  commission all together.    The source saw the move as part of Pyongyang's insistence to  the United States that the Armistice Agreement of 1953 should be  replaced by a peace treaty.    This source also reminded of an unexpected military exercise  on April 30 when 15 to 20 North Korean air force planes took off  from Pyongyang and flew as far down South as near the  demarcation line.    The president added that the council must try to regain the  public's trust by demonstrating unity and cooperation.    Monday's breakfast meeting was the first gathering of the  council members since Yi took office last Saturday.    The members shared their views on pending issues, including  the North Korean nuclear dispute and resettlement of North  Korean escapees from Siberian logging camps.</p>

			<p><P> November 15, 1989, Wednesday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCE CLEANUP AT CANYON COUNTRY SITE SLATED  </P> <P> California health authorities announced today that they will begin a cleanup of  hazardous substances at a bankrupt oil refinery in Canyon Country.  </P> <P> The state Department of Health Services has initially earmarked up to $1  million on the cleanup of the five-acre Lubrication Co. of America site on Lang  Station Road east of the Antelope Valley Freeway, said Richard Varenchik, a  spokesman for the agency.  </P> <P> The agency's toxic substances control program will also pay for a series of  soil studies to determine if any ground contamination occurred from spillage of  oils and fuels that were refined at the plant between 1960 and 1987, Varenchik  said.  </P> <P> A report from the state agency concludes that surface runoff of spills from the  plant was carried in a drainage ditch to the bed of the nearby Santa Clarita  River. Preliminary tests of water from two wells in the area were inconclusive  as to whether there was contamination from LCA, Varenchik said.  </P> <P> Money for the cleanup came from a 1984 bond that raised funds for a statewide  cleanup of hazardous substances. Under an agreement with Grant Ivey, the owner  of LCA, the property will sold and the state will be reimbursed cleanup costs  of up to $1.4 million, Varenchik said.  </P></p>

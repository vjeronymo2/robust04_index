The Korea Institute for International Economic Policy said  in  its report that foreign investment in Korea which had shown a  rapid pickup early in the 1980s went into the doldrums from 1989.    The report attributed dwindling foreign investment in Korea  to the overall deterioration of foreign investment conditions.  "Soaring labor costs, a continuation of high interest rates and  spiralling inflation combined to aggravate Korea's investment  climate," it said.    In addition, the existence of various administrative red  tape  and inadequate protection of intellectual property rights also  tarnished Korea's attractiveness to foreign investors, it  claimed.    According to the report, the rate of capital formation  contributed by foreign investment during 1986-1991 stood at a  meager 1.1 percent. The rate compares with Taiwan's 3.5  percent, Singapore's 29.4 percent, Hong Kong's 12.1 percent and  China's 2.3 percent.    Moreover, the latest trend in foreign investment in Korea  has  shown a sustained fall, casting a pall over the country's bid to  join the ranks of advanced industrial countries by attracting  more foreign capital, the report said.    Foreign investment in Korea soared from the early 1980s as  Seoul adopted a massive liberalization policy. Foreign  investment reached its zenith in the late 1980s with annual  investment amounting to 1.28 billion dollars in 1988.    But foreign investment began to slide from 1989 as Korea's  investment conditions rapidly deteriorated, dropping to 894  million dollars in 1992.    According to the report, foreign-invested manufacturing  companies in Korea numbered 1,570 as of March last year with  their total investment amounting to about 5.56 billion dollars.    By industry, electrics and electronics topped the list of  foreign-invested manufacturing companies with 344 in operation,  followed by machinery (331) and chemical engineering (241).  These three industries account for nearly 58 percent of the  total number of foreign-invested manufacturing companies in  Korea.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Foreign-invested Manufacturing Cos.

Of the 1,570 foreign-invested manufacturing companies, only  13.6 percent or 214 companies are 100 percent foreign-owned with  most of them being joint ventures with Korean companies,  according to the report.    Japanese investors account for about 61 percent of the total  foreign-invested manufacturing companies with investors from the  United States making up 21 percent. The remainder are those  from European or other countries.    To lure more foreign capital, the report proposed an  across-the- board improvement in Korea's business conditions.    "Korea is still regarded as one of the promising countries  for foreign investment because of its high growth potential and  sustained economic development," it said.    If Korea exerts every effort to revamp its business  conditions, foreign investment will make a strong rebound in the  future, the report said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Malaysia is a gateway to ASEAN with the 350 million  people in its dynamic region. The country is also a gateway to  the whole of the East Asia region. The minister of  international trade and industry, Datuk Sri Rafidah Aziz said in  view of this there should be a greater network between the  private sectors of both Malaysia and Czech. She noted that  Malaysia is very interested to receive foreign direct  investments in a broad range of activities. She said this at a  meeting with the Foreign Minister of Czech Josef Zieleniec and  his 35-member trade delegation at her ministry in Kuala Lumpur  today.    Datuk Sri Rafidah said bilateral trade of the two countries  was only U.S.$20 million last year. She pointed out that the  volume is very small and there is potential to expand it.    Mr. Josef Zieleniec and the delegation are on a two-day  visit  to Malaysia. He called on the minister of foreign affairs,  Datuk Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, at the Foreign Ministry in Kuala  Lumpur this afternoon.</p>

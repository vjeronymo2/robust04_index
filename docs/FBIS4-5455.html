			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wichit Sirithawiphon] </F>   [Text] Thailand may elect to exclude some petrochemical  products from AFTA [ASEAN Free Trade Area] liberalisation if  Indonesia and Malaysia insist on doing the same said an informed  Finance Ministry source.    Thailand keeps petrochemical industries under the ASEAN Free  Trade Area normal track while Indonesia and Malaysia keep these  industries on an exclusion list, added the source. However,  Thailand will not include all petrochemical products in the  exclusion list -- only locally-made products will be protected,  he noted.    The source commented that Singapore stands to gain  advantages  over its neighbouring countries in these industries as it has  more fully integrated its industries. The source noted that  Singaporean products would flood the three countries if import  taxes were diminished.    Malaysia has systematically developed its petrochemical  industries while Indonesia has only six downstream petrochemical  industries, explained the source. However, Brunei and the  Philippines have not established petrochemical industries, noted  the source. Thailand will keep petrochemical industries under  an exclusion list but plans to reduce the protection period from  eight to five years.    According to the source, the list of the protected items are  ethylene, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene, polystrylene,  polypropylene, and propylene. The source confirmed that today's  AFTA meeting, chaired by Finance Minister Tharin Nimmanhemin,  will consider this matter among other issues.    The studies conducted by the Ministry of Finance indicate  that it is necessary to support the Thai petrochemical industry  as it is a major basic industry and is only in its early  development stages, noted the source. The source said if  Malaysia and Indonesia accept a Ministry of Finance proposal to  keep their petrochemical industries under the normal track, the  Ministry would develop alternatives to help the emerging  industries faced with a high interest rate burden.    The agenda for the AFTA meeting today will consider ways to  expedite the realisation of the free trade area from 15 to 10-12  years, to include consideration on non-processed agricultural  products, said the source. The source conceded that  disagreement among ASEAN members continues on the definition of  the terms "processed" and "non-processed" goods.    Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak has proposed  that Thailand withdraw some petrochemical products from the  normal track to the exclusion list if other ASEAN countries  decide to add their products to the exclusion list.    According to Dr Suphachai, if Thailand could successfully  negotiate with the two countries to bring the petrochemical  industries under the normal track, Thailand could accept the  Malaysian request that it keep palm oil under the normal track.    Previously the Thai Government proposed to keep the  petrochemical industry under the fast track, however, it has  decided to keep the industry under the normal track.    The local production cost of the Thai industry is higher  than  imports regardless of upstream, intermediate or downstream  industries. The reason cited is expensive local raw materials  and the fact that production has not achieved economy of scale.</p>

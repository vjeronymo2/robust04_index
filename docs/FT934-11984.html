			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / International Bonds: Borrowers take advantage of competitive conditions SEVERAL issuers took advantage of the traditional end-of-year rush by banks to bolster their positions in the Eurobond league to raise cheap funding yesterday. Reports that a range of banks had made aggressive bids for a mandate to arrange a Pounds 400m five-year Eurobond issue for the European Investment Bank (EIB) indicated that this trend was likely to continue. As a result of the increased competition, the EIB is likely to be able to price its bonds to yield within five basis points over the when-issued UK government bond due 1999, the new five-year benchmark in the sterling bond market. The offering is expected to be launched today. The Republic of Finland achieved a spread of 15 basis points over the London interbank offered rate (Libor) when it raised SFr300m through an offering of 10-year bonds. The spread was taken as further evidence that Finland's standing with international investors was continuing to improve. However, the offering itself, via Credit Suisse, was thought to be aggressively priced relative to other 10-year deals in the secondary market. One syndicate manager noted that the yield on the bonds was lower than the yields on outstanding bonds issued by triple-A rated borrowers. The bonds, which had an issue price of 102.75, were trading at less 2 3/8 per cent in the late afternoon, just outside fees. The low interest rate environment in Switzerland and the Swiss franc's strength against the D-Mark are expected to attract more issuers to the Swiss bond market. SBC is likely to launch a SFr100m deal for a high-quality European borrower and an Austrian utility is expected to raise a similar amount later in the week. The European Coal and Steel Community made a rare appearance in the Eurobond market, raising FFr900m through an offering of eight-year Eurobonds. The scarcity value of the borrower and the fact that the bonds were largely pre-placed enabled the borrower to achieve a low spread of 12 basis points over the French government's 9 1/2 per cent OAT due 2001. Joint lead CCF said that French investment funds involved in the eight-year tax-free savings plans were strong buyers of the bonds, but that demand from Hong Kong and Singapore was also notable. When the bonds were freed to trade, the spread remained unchanged. Elsewhere, Halifax Building Society tapped the current demand for Ecu-denominated paper with its Ecu150m issue of five-year Eurobonds. The proceeds of the issue were thought to have been swapped into floating-rate sterling. Some syndicate managers said the yield spread on the bonds - 10 basis points over underlying French government bonds - should have been at least five basis points wider. They added that the small size of the issue might not appeal to investors who preferred to buy liquid issues, in view of the Ecu bond market's turbulent past. However, lead manager UBS said that the issue provided a fresh supply of corporate paper in the Ecu bond market and that a substantial portion of the bonds had been sold by the end of the day. The bonds were kept in syndicate overnight and are expected to be freed to trade today.</p>

			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SCHOOLS FIGHT OWN WAR -- AGAINST GANG ATTIRE  </P> <P> Orange County educators, once concerned about short-shorts, halter tops and  bare feet disrupting classrooms, are now clamping down on gang-style fashions  in the hope of stopping neighborhood violence from infecting their campuses.  </P> <P> "No gang identification is allowed. They just can't wear it to school. Period,"  said Duane Clizbe, principal of La Vista High School, a continuation school in  Fullerton. "We've got some local gangs here, and we don't want that spilling  over" into the school.  </P> <P> Two weeks ago, the Newport-Mesa Unified School District updated its dress code  to ban "materials, symbols or dress" that could disrupt school operations,  joining a growing list of districts that are trying to keep gang attire out of  their schools. In addition, the district pledged to assure its students that  schools would be free from "fear, intimidation, or physical harm caused by . .  . groups and individuals."  </P> <P> "We're simply being overcautious," said Bob Francy, director of student  services for Newport-Mesa Unified School District. "Schools in this area  haven't been hit hard with gang activity, (but) there may be a problem  tomorrow."  </P> <P> </P> <P> May Get Worse  </P> <P> Many students, however, believe that toughening the dress policy will do little  to curtail the increasing problems neighborhood gangs pose and that it may even  bolster the fashionable image of gang-style dress.  </P> <P> "Making a dress code would make people rebel more," said Clyde Perezcasteneda,  a senior at Santiago High School in Garden Grove, where baseball-type hats have  been banned.  </P> <P> "A hat (alone) is not going to get you shot," said Perezcasteneda, a football  player and student government member. "It's the clothes you wear, the people  you hang around with and the way you act."  </P> <P> Jane Alvarez, 14, a Santa Ana High School freshman, is also critical of strict  dress codes.  </P> <P> "This is America," she said. "It's a free country and you can wear what you  want."  </P> <P> Most districts in the county avoid the word gang in dress codes and instead set  broad guidelines for schools. They hope to prevent gang attire by forbidding  students to wear certain baseball-type hats, jackets with gang logos, bandannas  and red or blue-dominated outfits. Blue and red are the preferred colors of the  Crips and Bloods gangs, which are based in Los Angeles but have made inroads in  Orange County in recent years.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Up to Principals  </P> <P> The final decision on exactly which hats, jackets and other items are banned is  usually left up to school principals.  </P> <P> "These are judgment calls," said John Nicoll, superintendent of the  Newport-Mesa school district. "And we tend to support the people making them."  </P> <P> But making those calls can be tough.  </P> <P> Bob O'Higgins, principal at Santiago High School, said it is difficult to keep  up with students' changing tastes.  </P> <P> "You generally go with the change in style, the change in symbols," he said.  The current rage at Santiago -- and O'Higgins' latest targets -- are colored  shoelaces, bandannas, hats worn backward and gang jackets.  </P> <P> "But that doesn't mean that somewhere down the line they'll get ahead of us,"  O'Higgins said. "It's hard. You have to be alert. It's just a constant  vigilance."  </P> <P> Maria Valdivia, a freshman at Santa Ana High School with three brothers in  gangs, knows the garb well. "Gangs? They wear khakis, Levi's, Hush Puppies,  Nike, (polo-style) shirts buttoned all the way up, dickies and Levi cords," she  said.  </P> <P> "Kids are very creative dressers, and I don't mind that," La Vista Principal  Clizbe said, citing in particular the various dyed, spiked and shaved hair  styles of the day.  </P> <P> But gang-type clothing, he said, goes too far.  </P> <P> "It wouldn't bother me, if it didn't (hurt) the school," Clizbe said. "But it  does. It frightens kids."  </P></p>

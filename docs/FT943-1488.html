			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / International Company News: News Corp pins its colours to television's mast News Corporation's invest-ments in television will be a major source of growth for the global media group, Mr Rupert Murdoch, chief executive and chairman, said in the company's annual report, Reuter reports from Sydney. 'The investments we have made demonstrate our continued belief in the growth potential of television around the world,' Mr Murdoch said. 'We believe that the television industry, whether it be free to air, satellite or pay, will be a major area of growth for this company for the rest of the decade.' Mr Murdoch said News Corp was confident that its Asian satellite broadcaster, Star TV, would achieve greater market penetration in the next 18 months, reaching 90m homes from 42m at present. News Corp has a 64 per cent stake in Star TV. News Corp also expects higher household penetration for its 50 per cent-owned UK satellite broadcasting company, BSkyB - in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a stake - aided in part by the continued growth in cable television. News Corp said more than 700,000 cable households in the UK saw Sky, as did 2.5m homes with satellite dishes. 'With dish subscribers growing around 700,000 annually versus 250,000 for cable households, we believe that satellite will be the primary form of distribution in the medium term,' Mr Murdoch said. He said News Corp continued to invest in its base businesses in 1993-94 to keep them competitive. 'While we have made significant investments throughout the corporation over the past 12 months, we have also simultaneously continued to strengthen our financial condition.' Debt was reduced by ADollars 1.8bn (USDollars 1.32bn). 'We have continued to access the long-term public markets, providing us with long-term financing which more appropriately matches the long-term nature of our investments,' he said. Earlier this month News Corp announced record net profits of ADollars 1.34bn for 1993-94.</p>

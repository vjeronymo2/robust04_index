			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] In a special message addressed through  AL-'ARABI, His Holiness Pope Shanudah has declared that he  categorically rejects the use of the Egyptian Copts' name at a  conference on minority rights. He said: We are Egyptians and  part of the Egyptian people. We are not a minority, do not  consider ourselves a minority, and do not like others to call us  a minority. The terms majority and minority indicate  discrimination and segregation. This does not befit the sons of  a single homeland, especially in beloved Egypt. The pope was  commenting on a conference of Egyptians and foreigners which is  being sponsored by a publication house.    Meanwhile, [Egyptian writer] Muhammad Hasanayn Haykal has  refused to attend the conference. He published an article  explaining the reasons for not attending, saying that the  Egyptian Copts are not a minority and it is wrong to view them  from this standpoint. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Peter Walker denies any knowledge of MCC scandals PETER WALKER, the former Secretary of State for Wales who resigned from Maxwell Communication Corporation last summer shortly before he was due to become chairman, yesterday stressed that he had no knowledge of the scandals that have since emerged from within the group. He also said that his resignation followed a request from the Maxwells - which reflected his own recommendations - and was not the result of any confidential information he had gathered on the state of the group's finances. Mr Walker confirmed that he had been paid Pounds 100,000 - his first year's salary under a three-year contract as chairman - and was also allowed to keep the Mercedes saloon valued at more than Pounds 30,000 that came with the job and which he had taken in place of his own car. He said he was offered the job as chairman of MCC at the start of 1991 'much to my surprise' after an informal dinner he held for Kevin Maxwell and his wife at his home. Mr Walker believes Kevin probably wanted to assert his control over MCC. Mr Walker's conditions were that he could select four non-executive directors and that Mr Robert Maxwell resigned from the main board and all of MCC's subsidiaries. Mr Walker wanted a 'totally conventional business with everything disclosed'. 'The job did not attract me at first,' he said. 'But it was quite an exciting challenge to de-Maxwellise a vast publishing house . . . there was a great intellectual attraction.' He only met the late Mr Maxwell occasionally, and clashed with him on one occasion when he received a letter summoning him to a board meeting to discuss the accounts at just 24 hours' notice. Mr Walker could not attend at such short notice. 'I sent him a sharp note back,' he said. During the period since joining the board as a non-executive director on April 2, he spent much of his time travelling to MCC subsidiaries for presentations in the UK and the US. He concluded that the US companies were 'marvellous and well run', but that in the UK there was 'nothing of importance', no cash to make acquisitions and little scope for growth. 'The idea of managing the group from Holborn seemed absolutely crazy,' he said. 'I said if I were you, I would turn MCC into a totally American group, call it Macmillan and reduce the family equity.' Mr Walker was then told on July 11 last year that Mr Robert Maxwell had decided to take action along these lines. There was therefore little need for him to continue as chairman, and he said he was offered one year's salary and the company car. He had never seen any figures concerning the MCC pension fund, which did not fall within his responsibility. He attended one meeting with the auditors to approve the 1991 accounts and had no reason to doubt them.</p>

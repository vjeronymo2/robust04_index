			<p>BFN       [Editorial report] The following is a compilation of  reports on developments related to the Colombian presidential  runoff election scheduled for 19 June.    Andres Pastrana has issued a message to farmers during  Agriculture Day along with the four-point program he plans to  implement. The program includes the identification of priorities  in the agriculture sector, emergency policies to deal with the  top problems, and "the giving of resources and delegation of  concrete responsibilities so that the rural area can once again  have owners." (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 6 Jun 94  p 6a)    During his first tour after the 28 May elections, Liberal  Party presidential candidate Ernesto Samper has visited the  coastal area and proposed new measures to mitigate the economic  situation in the border and rural areas. He has said his  proposal for the border area included "the extension of the  value-added tax, tax exemptions for new industries, and the  renegotiation of commercial debts." Pastrana has also reported  several liberal leaders in Santa Fe de Bogota, Cauca, Tolima,  and Narino have offered him their support. (Santa Fe de Bogota  Inravision Television Canal A Network in Spanish 1800 GMT 4 Jun  94)    Samper met with coffee producers in Manizales recently. In  his speech, he called on the government to make another  readjustment in the price of the 125-kg sack of coffee and set  it at 150,000 pesos. He said he was not satisfied with the  recent readjustment, "because the international price is  currently between $1.50 to $1.60 per pound, and the coffee  producer is getting approximately 82 cents; that is, half the  price of a pound of coffee." In Caldas, Samper talked about the  peace talks, saying "I will clearly establish the negotiations  agenda. I promise I will respect human rights during my  administration, will not allow paramilitary activities, and will  also ask the guerrillas to comply with the commitments to  respect human rights." (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish  6 Jun 94 p 6a)    Led by Antonio Navarro Wolff, the 19 April Movement  Democratic Alliance assembly has decided not to back the  conservative or liberal parties in the upcoming runoff  elections. Ernesto Samper is seeking votes everywhere and has  even accepted the support of extreme rightist General Oscar Maza  Marquez. Andres Pastrana is also preparing for the runoff and  plans to continue his strategy to strengthen his base of  support. Both candidates are trying to obtain the votes of the  large number of people who did not vote in the recent election.  The national registrar has reported 7 million of 24 million  eligible voters are not on the electoral listings and, thus,  will be ineligible to vote. He added a new census of the  population is necessary to enable all eligible citizens to vote.  (Santa Fe de Bogota Inravision Television Cadena 1 in Spanish  0130 GMT 5 Jun 94)</p>

			<p><P> February 26, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CANDIDATE STUMPS FROM PULPIT  </P> <P> Andrew Young, who is trying to become Georgia's first black governor, took to  the pulpit at a rural Baptist church where the whites were the Sunday regulars  and the blacks were the guests.  </P> <P> The service at the First Baptist Church was a twist on the decades of white  politicians' preaching at black churches, with white visitors sitting in the  pews.  </P> <P> Young, a former ambassador to the United Nations and a former Atlanta mayor, is  a Congregationalist minister.  </P> <P> He took his text from Paul's letter to the Ephesians: "For he is our peace, who  has made us both one, and has broken down the dividing wall of hostility."  </P> <P> During the sermon, Young spoke of a "transformation of our politics" that has  worn out the metaphor of America as a melting pot.  </P> <P> "We're all in the same pot, but it is not so much like a  least-common-denominator soup. It is more like a stew -- our differences only  enhance and enrich," he said.  </P></p>

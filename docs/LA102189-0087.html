			<p><P> October 21, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BALLOT FOR QUAKE-SAFE, LOW-RENT HOMES ASKED  </P> <P> Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley and state Senate President Pro Tem David Roberti  (D-Los Angeles) on Friday called for a $90-million bond measure on the next  city ballot to bring low-income rental housing up to seismic safety standards.  </P> <P> A similar measure -- Proposition 3 -- to raise funds for restoration of  pre-1933 unreinforced masonry buildings, failed by two percentage points of  winning a required two-thirds approval from voters in April.  </P> <P> In a letter to Bradley and the City Council, Roberti said the Northern  California earthquake "dramatically reminded us all in Los Angeles of our own  vulnerability and our need to be fully prepared for our own inevitable  disaster."  </P> <P> Bradley said he wanted to "give voters one more chance to make the financing  available so that all of our buildings can become earthquake safe."  </P> <P> The bond measure would allow the city to make loans to strengthen low-income  rental housing properties which are not earthquake-safe and for nonprofit  organizations to buy and improve rental housing that is not earthquake-safe.  </P></p>

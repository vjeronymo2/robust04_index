			<p>CSO     [Text] Jakarta (ANGKATAN BERSENJATA)--MPR [People's  Consultative Assembly] Deputy Speaker Prof. Dr. H.A. Amiruddin  says that there is no need to worry about the issue of national  leadership succession, because the mechanism for it already  exists in laws.    "We do not follow a system like the one in Latin America,  where the president may be replaced at any time. That can  produce instability," Amiruddin said in reply to reporters'  questions at his office on Monday, 21 March.    In response to a question as to the significance of  President  Suharto's recent repeated mention of succession, Amiruddin said  he did not dare to judge. "Whether there is already a  presidential candidate, or the emergence of a presidential  candidate is expected, I do not know," he said.    "In fact, he says the subject of succession has many  definitions. It can be a question of the person, the mechanism,  on the understanding of the term itself," he added. "It is clear  that a leader will emerge at the time he is needed," Amiruddin  declared.    Amiruddin said the issue of succession should merely be left  for each of the sociopolitical forces to think about when the  time comes. This includes the subject of GBHN [Broad Outline of  State Policy] materials as well as the question of the next  candidates for president and vice president.    "All the sociopolitical forces have certainly considered and  readied their candidates, who will then be submitted to their  factions in the MPR," he added.    According to Amiruddin, if a single candidate emerges, the  system should not be blamed. It should be asked, however, if  they did not dare to nominate their "champions." "Making  nominations is a requirement, and such political activity does  not imply an effort to seize `power,'" he continued.    In reply to a question whether sociopolitical organizations  must now prepare their "champions" for the next succession and  publicize their names, Amiruddin said that preparing "champions"  now is not a problem.    As for mentioning the names of "champions," he said he could  not yet say. "Judging by experience and circumstances, there is  a danger if names are mentioned too soon," he said without  explaining what he meant by "danger."    Amiruddin admitted that the culture of Indonesian society  does not yet support a situation in which the names of persons  are mentioned. Developments in society still show variations in  thought and opinion. There is the worry that misunderstanding  could cause confusion.    "Does that mean there is not yet a democratic maturity in  society?" a reporter asked. "It is not a question of whether  democracy is mature or not, but a question of culture,"  Amiruddin replied.</p>

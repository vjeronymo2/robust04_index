			<p><P> April 10, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIS SUCCESS KEY: WRITE NOVEL BEFORE WORK  </P> <P> James B. Patterson is president of J. Walter Thompson USA, an advertising giant  with $1.6 billion a year in billings. He calls himself "a late bloomer." But  he's an early riser.  </P> <P> The reason: At 5:30 a.m. most weekdays, he starts the day by working on a  mystery novel. He types until 7 a.m., then departs his Manhattan penthouse for  the hurly-burly of big-league advertising.  </P> <P> The novel business has been good for him -- he's had five published. The  latest, "The Midnight Club," was optioned in December by film producer David  Brown, whose dossier includes "Jaws" and "Cocoon."  </P> <P> The book is about a tough, streetwise New York detective who works from a  wheelchair. He was put there after being shot and crippled -- and his wife  killed -- in retaliation for his efforts to nail a sleek, well-tailored,  international criminal nicknamed the "Grave Dancer."  </P> <P> The novel contains a good measure of hard-boiled suspense, the international  drug trade, rogue cops, rotten officials, a dab of kinky sex and a love  interest that evolves as the tale is told.  </P> <P> Patterson joined J. Walter Thompson in 1971 as a junior copywriter. He  graduated to published novelist five years later.  </P> <P> A trim, bearded man who calls his reveille scrivening a form of recreation, he  now is branching out to film, working on a screenplay as well as a sixth novel.  </P> <P> "I like it," he says of screen-scripting. "I feel that it's a better genre for  me. I think I have a lot of stories. I think I know what I'm doing in the film  area, because I've made so damn many films. . . ."  </P> <P> He refers to the 30-second kind for such entities as Burger King, Kodak, Slice  and the Red Cross. That is a world from which more than a few now-hot directors  in Hollywood have come.  </P> <P> Patterson got the suspense world's equivalent of the Oscar his first time out  with "The Thomas Berryman Number" -- an Edgar Award in 1976 from the Mystery  Writers of America for the best first mystery novel. About the assassination of  an important black leader in the South, it's the only book he ever wrote at  night.  </P> <P> "Maybe there's a lesson here," he wryly observes. His first success stemmed  from three things: a love of reading and writing that he discovered in college,  a need for a spare-time outlet and loneliness.  </P> <P> At the time he began "Berryman," Patterson -- a graduate of Manhattan College  who also has a master's degree in English from Vanderbilt -- was working his  way up through the creative ranks at JWT.  </P> <P> His days were busy. Nighttime was another matter.  </P> <P> "I had no one to love, so I'd go home and write in the kitchen, sitting on an  iron chair, writing on a table too high to really reach," he recalls.  </P> <P> The next novel, "The Jericho Commandment," was put together under happier  circumstances, and in the process set the pattern for what now are his pre-dawn  tussles with the muse.  </P> <P> There was a lady in his life by then. The nights were for her. "So I started  writing in the morning. I'd found that if you want to have somebody in your  life, better have some time for them."  </P> <P> It helps, he observes, that "generally, people do not want to get up at 5:30  a.m."  </P> <P> That the hero of his "The Midnight Club" is in a wheelchair is due to the  experiences of a woman with whom Patterson once lived.  </P> <P> "About 6 1/2, 7 years into our relationship, she developed a brain tumor," he  says, softly and quickly. "It put her in a wheelchair for 2 1/2 years, and then  she died."  </P> <P> While alive, she remained vital, full of life despite her disability, he  recalls, with a spirit that refused to quit. It was that spirit he put in the  book, he says -- that and his close-up awareness of the difficulties of life in  a wheelchair.  </P> <P> "Society is just not geared for handicapped people," he says, noting, for  example, how on bitter cold nights "the cabs won't stop because it's going to  take an extra two minutes to deal with the wheelchair and a handicapped  person."  </P></p>

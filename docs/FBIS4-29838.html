			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Senior Lieutenant General Dao Dinh Luyen, </F> member of the party Central Committee, chief of the Vietnam  People's Army General Staff, and deputy to the Ninth National  Assembly, by QUAN DOI NHAN DAN correspondent Mai Nam Thang; date  and place not given]    [Text] [Correspondent] According to many people, our  country's existing national defense law and policy are  inadequate, inconsistent, and "backward" compared with the  socioeconomic situation. Therefore, all echelons and sectors,  especially grassroots establishments, face numerous difficulties  in implementing national defense tasks. What is your opinion  about this issue?    [Dao Dinh Luyen] In implementing the principle of "state  control over society by means of law and constant efforts to  strengthen the socialist legal system" in all domains, including  national defense, in its capacity as a state organ in charge of  overseeing national defense, the Ministry of National Defense  has suggested that the National Assembly, the Council of State  (now the National Assembly Standing Committee), and the  Government review and adopt many important legal documents  directly relating to national defense tasks, like the Laws on  Selective Service and People's Army Officers and the Regulations  on Safeguarding National Defense Projects and Military  Installations. At the same time, it has coordinated with the  various ministries and sectors in promulgating many  interministerial and intersectorial directives to guide the  implementation of the aforementioned legal documents. It can be  said that those national defense-related laws and regulations  have gradually been supplemented to meet the requirements of the  new situation. Nonetheless, it is necessary to admit that the  existing national defense law and policy are still inadequate  and "backward" compared with the changes for the better in the  socioeconomic situation and with the requirements of the current  national defense tasks aimed at protecting the Fatherland and  socialist regime. Many legal documents were promulgated a long  time ago and applied to the system of state subsidization and  management by the central government and in the situation  prevailing during the national salvation struggle. Given the  current situation, they are no longer appropriate. This very  drawback has to some extent affected the implementation of  national defense tasks by the various echelons, sectors,  localities, and grassroots establishments. This situation  requires adequate investment to formulate laws to  institutionalize national defense policies and lines in the the  party's resolutions. As an immediate objective, it is necessary  to resolve major issues as follows:    -- Continued efforts are needed to improve and perfect the  national defense budget and set local level-national defense  expenditures and funds at an early date.    -- Steps must be taken to formulate a policy on science  and technology in support of national defense.    -- Plans must be worked out to resolve the problems  concerning the rear-army policy and military mobilization  preparedness.    It is important to work out a well-defined management,  inspection, and reward mechanism suitable to the implementation  of national defense tasks at all echelons to ensure uniform  application of national defense policies and lines.    [Correspondent] Is there any differences between the  amendments and supplements to the Law on Selective Service this  time and those in 1990? What are the basic contents and general  standpoints of the amendments and supplements this time?    [Dao Dinh Luyen] The existing Law on Selective Service was  adopted by the Seventh National Assembly on 30 December 1981.  The Eighth National Assembly amended or supplemented a number  of articles of this law on 21 December 1990. However, in view  of the need to build and develop the army and consolidate  national defense and security arrangements to effectively defend  our Fatherland and regime, we must conduct a comprehensive study  to formulate a national defense law that covers many fundamental  issues relating to the building of an all-people national  defense system and people's Armed Forces... The formulation of  such an important legal document requires time and other laws  and regulations. Given the changes for the better in all  aspects of the national situation, especially in the economic  field, we must amend or supplement a number of essential  articles that affect most directly the implementation of  citizens' selective service.    The key contents of amendments or supplements to the Law on  Selective Service this time focus on three main issues as  follows:    1. Defining the responsibilities of economic organizations,  including private business establishments, share-holding  corporations, limited partnership corporations, joint business  ventures with foreign countries... toward the implementation of  the Law on Selective Service of the Vietnamese state.    2. Further clarifying the responsibilities of the local  authorities and the Selective Service Council at all levels  toward the implementation of the Law on Selective Service.    3. Supplementing or amending a number of systems and  policies to make them consistent with the situation and help  strengthen the building and development of the army.    [Correspondent] Why does the current Law on Selective  Service not stipulate the obligations for youth who do not serve  in the army? In fact there are a large number of youth in this  category who pose a pressing problem in the annual troop  induction work. What are the measures to resolve this problem to  ensure social justice?    [Dao Dinh Luyen] To ensure social justice for those who  serve  in the army and those who do not is an essential task. However,  this is a difficult and complicated problem that cannot be  comprehensively and definitely resolved overnight.    For example, it is very difficult to organize production  activities for youth who are not recruited for the army,  especially when we still need more jobs for workers in society.  Besides, the state must spend a lot of money to handle this  issue. But if we decide that those who do not want to serve the  army must contribute money in compensation for their military  service, then we must be very careful to ensure justice in this  regard.    As far as the Law on Selective Service is concerned, it is  concentrated only on the policy and a mechanism aimed at  improving the daily life of troops in active service, discharged  soldiers, and those who are classified as a reserved force so as  to ensure justice for these people. As a result, I would like  to suggest that the state formulate and promulgate a regulation  on appropriate contributions by youth who do not serve in the  army in the cause of national defense and construction.    [Correspondent] Public opinion at present is very indignant  about those who violate the Law on Selective Service (those who  are dodging, ignoring the military service obligation, and  deserting their units) and are not seriously dealt with by the  law. Why is there still a "lenient" policy on this issue and  what are the measures to resolve this problem in the days ahead?    [Dao Dinh Luyen] The Law on Selective Service stipulates  various measures for punishment in this regard, while the  Criminal Code also clearly defines measures to deal with law  violations and punishments for violators. In reality, we have  on many occasions punished and reeducated those who violated the  law. However, in some cases, serious and prompt action was not  taken against them. The following are some of my observations:    -- The local administrations, such as village (ward) and  district (precinct) administrative units and other local law  enforcement agencies, must take the first serious action against  those who have dodged or ignored the military service  obligation. In some places and at certain times, the agencies  concerned in some localities have failed to satisfactorily carry  out this task. Many responsible agencies did not optimally  exercise their authority to help the local administration deal  with those who violate the law.    -- In the army, generally speaking, military units and  commanders of legal agencies in the army have promptly and  severely dealt with those who violated rules and regulations.  One obvious problem at present, however, is that we have failed  to deal severely with those who have deserted their units. This  is because we do not have a unified measure and a close  coordination between the army and the local administration to  carry out this task. Although we have taken a number of  actions, such as imposing fines or labor punishments against the  violators, these measures have not been officially defined in a  uniform manner and have therefore failed to deal severely with  the violators, while creating indignation among the people.    To resolve this problem, in the near future, the Ministry of  National Defense will coordinate with responsible agencies to  formulate regulations to deal with violators and submit them to  the state for approval. The ministry will, on the other hand,  cooperate more closely with the local administration and other  law enforcement agencies to monitor and deal promptly and  severely with those who violate the law.    [Correspondent] What policy and measures should the State  and  the Ministry of National Defense have to make the Law on  Selective Service (after it was amended, supplemented, and  approved by the National Assembly at this session) widely known  by the public, firmly grasped by sectors concerned, and  effectively implemented by law enforcement agencies?    [Dao Dinh Luyen] The law on Selective Service is one of the  key laws of the State. A large number of people are subjected  to this law while its implementation is on a nationwide-scale.  Improper implementation of the law may impact on the material  and spiritual life of the people and the mind and attitude of  cadres and combatants. As a result, supervision of the  implementation of this law must be close and careful. To  seriously and effectively implement the law, proper attention  should be paid to the following key tasks:    1. It is essential to improve national defense education and  enhance the military service obligation awareness among the  people, youth, and reserved forces in various units of the party  organizations, state agencies, and mass societies so as to  motivate them to enthusiastically implement and abide by the  law. Efforts must be made to combine the education task with  that of motivating the people to respect and abide by the state  laws.    2. We must strive to uphold the responsibility of various  echelons, sectors, localities, and military units in  implementing the law under the unified guidance of party  committees and the management of administration agencies.  Efforts must be made to bring into full play the responsibility  of branches, sectors, and mass organizations in this regard  while upholding the staff role of military agencies in  localities. Commanders of various army units must uphold their  responsibility in strengthening education and training and  improving the daily life of their units.    3. Efforts must be made to satisfactorily implement the  army's rules and regulations; and to continue to study, review,  and supplement various essential lines and policies to encourage  cadres and combatants to actively build the army and the  reserved force while enthusiastically improving their training  and standing ready for any assignments.</p>

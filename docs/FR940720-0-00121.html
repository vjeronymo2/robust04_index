Indicia of transportability include, but are not limited to, wheels, skids, carrying handles, dolly, trailer, or platform.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) An internal combustion engine is not a nonroad engine if:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The engine is used to propel a motor vehicle or a vehicle used solely for competition, or is subject to standards promulgated under section 202 of the Act; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The engine is regulated by a federal New Source Performance Standard promulgated under section 111 of the Act; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The engine otherwise included in paragraph (1)(iii) of this definition remains or will remain at a location for more than 12 consecutive months or a shorter period of time for an engine located at a seasonal source. A location is any single site at a building, structure, facility, or installation. Any engine (or engines) that replaces an engine at a location and that is intended to perform the same or similar function as the engine replaced will be included in calculating the consecutive time period. An engine located at a seasonal source is an engine that remains at a seasonal source during the full annual operating period of the seasonal source. A seasonal source is a stationary source that remains in a single location on a permanent basis (i.e., at least two years) and that operates at that single location approximately three (or more) each year. This paragraph does not apply to an engine after the engine is removed from the location.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Primarily used <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  means used 51 percent or more.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;85.1603  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Application of definitions;

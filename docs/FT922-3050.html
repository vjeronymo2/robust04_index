			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Lost faith in Fisons Yesterday's profoundly depressing news from Fisons could prove the last straw for its long-suffering shareholders. Only a matter of weeks ago, the company was steering the market towards first half profits this year of some Pounds 85m, down only Pounds 10m from the year before. It now appears that the figure could be as low as Pounds 35m. Not only has the company proved persistently unable to produce some of its drugs to acceptable standards, it now appears that its scientific equipment division, supposedly a counterbalance to the drugs division, will show a drop in profits of some 30 per cent in the first half as well. How far this is due to bad luck as opposed to bad management may no longer be relevant. As a good small drug company in a world of giants, Fisons had a case to make for continued independence. But the big drug companies are also fast-growing. If, as optimistic forecasts now suggest, Fisons makes Pounds 150m before tax this year, its earnings per share will be lower than five years before. Even after yesterday's 100p share price plunge, the Pounds 150m figure would leave the shares on 15 times earnings. That can scarcely be justified by the trading record. The question is rather one of break-up value. The problem is that there are no obvious buyers for both the drug and instrument divisions. In a market in which warehousing assets is too expensive for most predators to contemplate, it is perhaps time for the Fisons board to do the decent thing and break up the company themselves.</p>

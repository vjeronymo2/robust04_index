			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / MEPs demand EC growth package to help create jobs MEMBERS of the European Parliament yesterday called for a reflationary jobs package for Europe, warning that rising unemployment was undermining public confidence in the European Community and its plans for European union. During a debate on the European Commission's annual economic report for 1993, MEPs criticised as 'timid' the EC growth package agreed by member states at the Edinburgh summit last December. Without 3 per cent growth, the number of people out of work in the Community would reach 17m - or almost 11 per cent - by the end of the year. Mr Henning Christophersen, EC economics commissioner, acknowledged that the Commission's growth forecast of 0.8 per cent for 1993 raised questions about whether member states would meet the 'convergence criteria' required to be eligible for European Monetary Union in 1996. But he held out the prospect of a speedy drop in interest rates, particularly in Germany, to offset the recession. A stark warning of the risks of low growth and competitive devaluations caused by the recent monetary instability in the EC appeared in a parliamentary report on the Commission's growth forecasts prepared by Mr Alman Metten, a Dutch Socialist MEP. According to the report, 'recent developments show that EC countries are so interdependent that devaluation by one produces a domino effect of competing devaluations. Were these phenomena to continue long, then even the single market would be endangered.' Mr Metten said yesterday that without lower interest rates in Germany, the French franc risked having to float outside the ERM. He pointed to the possibility of setting target zones of fluctuation for the dollar, yen, D-Mark and possibly the Ecu, to restore monetary stability.</p>

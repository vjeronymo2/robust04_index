			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAGING FIRM'S STOCK SPURT CALLED A SCAM  </P> <P> The Securities and Exchange Commission says it now knows why the stock of Santa  Ana-based Southland Communication Inc. nearly doubled in price a few weeks ago  despite the company's dreadful performance: a massive stock market manipulation  scheme by the firm's president.  </P> <P> The SEC filed a civil lawsuit Monday in federal court in Manhattan, accusing  Southland Communication President and Chief Executive Ahmad N. Bayaa, as well  as Atlanta stock broker Shaw Tehrani and four others of artificially driving up  the price of the company's stock to $16.75 per share from $8.75 between March  13 and April 3. Southland Communication, which does business as National  Paging, provides electronic paging services.  </P> <P> The remarkable run-up and exceptionally heavy trading volume puzzled stock  analysts and traders because it coincided with reports that the company was in  severe financial trouble. The bizarre activity led the SEC on April 3 to halt  trading in the stock. It hasn't been publicly traded since.  </P> <P> In the 28-page lawsuit, the SEC claims that Bayaa, Tehrani and other friends of  Bayaa's bought up large amounts of the thinly traded stock to thwart  "short-sellers" who were attempting to profit from an expected drop in the  stock's price. They also hoped to keep the stock price up long enough that a  private placement of additional stock and an acquisition of another paging  company could be completed.  </P> <P> The suit charges that the swift, sharp price run-up was intended in part to  punish short-sellers, who were then forced to cover their short positions at  substantial losses. Short-sellers borrow stock and sell it, hoping the market  price will go down. They can then return the stock by buying shares back at the  lower price and pocketing the difference.  </P> <P> The suit charges that Bayaa and the other defendants opened numerous brokerage  accounts around the country to make it appear that there was heavy demand for  the stock. They also allegedly engaged in sham trades and ran up an unpaid bill  of $11.6 million from buying thousands of shares on margin -- that is, without  immediately paying the full purchase price of the stock. Southland  Communication's stock was traded in the over-the-counter market.  </P> <P> The SEC asked that the six defendants be ordered to give up all profits from  the allegedly illegal activity. The suit didn't specify an amount. But Daniel  R. Schnipper, senior special counsel in the SEC's New York regional office,  said it could total in the millions of dollars. The SEC also asks the court to  freeze the personal assets of Bayaa and Tehrani, except for what the men need  for essential living expenses and attorneys' fees.  </P> <P> Schnipper refused to say if there is any parallel criminal investigation under  way.  </P> <P> James J. Carroll III, a Los Angeles lawyer whose firm, Sheppard, Mullin,  Richter and Hampton, represents both Southland Communication and Bayaa, said he  hadn't seen the SEC lawsuit and couldn't comment on specific charges. But he  said: "We were very surprised that Mr. Bayaa was named as a defendant. We don't  think he's done anything wrong."  </P> <P> Bayaa himself did not return a telephone call to his office.  </P> <P> Tehrani, a stock broker at B.C. Financial Corp. in Atlanta, also did not return  a call to his office, as did a New York lawyer said to be representing him,  Jeffrey Livingston.  </P> <P> The other defendants couldn't immediately be located for comment. They are  Francois Alhaj and Abdul Rahman Deeb, described as self-employed oil  consultants; Ramzia Kriedly, described as co-owner of an oil company in Dubai,  and Ziad Twal, who the suit says "appears to be" a financial adviser employed  by Security Pacific Bank. David Garcia, a Security Pacific spokesman, said, "We  have no employee by that name."  </P> <P> The SEC charges that the scheme began at least as early as January, 1989, when  Bayaa and Tehrani allegedly joined together in a plan to control the market  price of Southland Communication's stock. The suit charges that by the middle  of last month, the two, through various accounts, came to control 89% of the  company's publicly traded stock.  </P> <P> The control enabled the firm to dramatically boost the stock price even though,  the SEC says, the company "is in grave financial condition." For its fiscal  first quarter ended Jan. 31, the company reported a loss of $323,529 on revenue  of $1.9 million, compared to a net loss of $258,975 on revenue of $1.4 million  for the same period a year ago. The SEC suit noted that Southland  Communication's own first-quarter statement warned investors that "the  company's recurring losses from operations and working capital deficiency raise  substantial doubts about (the company's) ability to continue as a going  concern."  </P> <P> The suit charges that Bayaa had hoped to keep the stock price elevated long  enough to complete a private placement of new stock that would have brought in  $5 million in new capital and to complete the planned acquisition of another  paging company, A+ Beepers of California.  </P> <P> The suit says that when Tehrani learned by phone on March 3 of an anonymous  report recommending short sales of the company's stock, he became so angry that  he threw a telephone through his office window.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Zvornik, May 10 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Moslems on  Tuesday violated the truce in the exclusion zone around Sarajevo  introduced in February this year, by attacking the Serb suburb  of Ilijas from small arms and mortars, the Bosnian Serb army  said in a statement. The same source also reported Moslem  sniper activity against the Serb-controlled parts of Sarajevo,  especially the suburbs of Nedzarici, Grbavica and Ilidza.  Extensive Moslem engineering works are under way in the  Sarajevo suburbs of Vojnicko Polje and Mojmilo and the area near  the Jewish cemetery, the statement said.    Following a NATO ultimatum and guarantees from Moscow that  Russian peacekeepers will be deployed along the Moslem-Serb  demarcation line in Sarajevo, the Serbs in February withdrew  from the exclusion zone and placed their heavy weapons under  U.N. control. The Moslems have evidently not complied with the  NATO demand. A U.N. officer told the AFP on Tuesday that  Bosnian Moslems deployed six of their heavy weapons on the  southern slopes of Mt Igman near Sarajevo, on the line of  contact with the Serbs, along with about 1,000 troops.    Bosnian Serb military sources reported that the Moslems on  Tuesday launched artillery attacks on Serb-controlled Han  Pijesak, Vlasenica, Sekovici and Zvornik in the east of war-torn  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Serb reconnaissance teams have reported Moslem troop  movements and concentrations towards the Serb towns of Sekovici  and Zvornik.</p>

			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei closes at its lowest level since April 1986 GROWING pessimism about the economy and corporate earnings prompted a fall in the futures market, and the Nikkei average dropped 2.8 per cent to its lowest level since April 1986, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average closed 460.46 down at 15,541.95 on futures-linked arbitrage unwinding and short-selling by investors. The index rose to the day's high of 16,059.61 soon after the opening, encouraged by Tuesday's Wall Street showing. But a fall in the futures market triggered weakness in cash prices, and the Nikkei tumbled to the session's low of 15,432.36 in the afternoon. Volume increased to 250m shares from 205m, but market participants said the bulk of activity was futures-related. Declines led rises by 876 to 108, with 113 stocks unchanged. A total of 213 issues fell to new lows for the year. The Topix index of all first section stocks lost 23.63 to 1,205.75, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index slipped 6.06 to 940.11. Worries about a prolonged slump in the economy and possible downward revisions in corporate earnings sent jitters through the market. Mr Hiromichi Ishikawa, managing director at Yamaichi Securities, commented: 'The market will not rebound until we can see a real recovery.' Nippon Life said institutions, especially life assurers, would not commit funds until they believe the risk in the market has faded. 'With most of the unrealised gains on stock holdings lost, life assurers cannot take risks on investments,' said an analyst. Analysts said banks, which faced problems meeting capital ratios set by the Bank for International Settlements due to the sharp decline in hidden assets, were trying to reduce exposure to the stock market by selling futures contracts. Mr Jason James, strategist at James Capel, said: 'It is a vicious cycle since a fall in the futures market in turn depresses the cash market.' Market participants have become increasingly bearish towards the electronics sector, following last week's disappointing second quarter earnings from IBM. Analysts expect many of the Japanese electronics groups to be hit by slowing demand and increasing inventories. Hitachi dipped Y4 to Y748 and Fujitsu Y14 to Y569. Rumours that Sony was going to announce a downward revision in its earnings forecast sent the issue down Y90 to Y3,940. Brokerage houses were also sold on a depressing earnings outlook. Market participants expect their revenues to suffer from the low market volumes. Nomura Securities receded Y30 to Y1,240 and Nikko Securities Y20 to Y511. In Osaka, the OSE average finished 408.54 weaker at 17,942.53, its lowest closing level since November 1986. Volume expanded from 15.8m shares to 23.4m. Roundup THE REGION'S markets showed mixed performances yesterday, while Hong Kong was closed down because of the approach of a typhoon. SINGAPORE regained some ground after two consecutive days of declines. The Straits Times Industrial index improved 2.44 to 1,436.90 with some 45.8m shares traded. Among the active issues, SIA put on 20 cents to SDollars 12.90 and Industrial Commercial Bank gained 15 cents to SDollars 6.20. SEOUL achieved a 2.7 per cent advance in moderate trade, the composite index ending 14.16 ahead at 526.00. Turnover grew to Won162.96bn from Won107.53bn. Rises outnumbered falls by 680 to 101 and a total of 248 shares attained their upper limits for the day. AUSTRALIA saw a strong opening but then declined in reaction to Tokyo's fall. The All Ordinaries index shed a net 2.0 at 1,607.2. Rothmans, down 50 cents to ADollars 6.70, registered one of the day's steepest falls after the resignation of the chief executive. This is the first time that the shares have closed below ADollars 7 since 1987. Banks were mostly weak, although National Australia Bank added 3 cents at ADollars 7.90 in the wake of Tuesday's bid for Bank of New Zealand. TAIWAN finished slightly lower after early buying in low-priced issues failed to boost sentiment. The weighted index lost 4.22 at 4,154.80 and turnover contracted to TDollars 18.57bn from TDollars 23.73bn. Food, plastic, textile and cement shares showed gains but other sectors fell. NEW ZEALAND's NZSE-40 index ended 8.43 higher at 1,568.51. Fletcher Challenge rose 8 cents to NZDollars 3.38 and Carter Holt Harvey firmed 5 cents to NZDollars 2.65. Air New Zealand closed at a year's high, up 6 cents at NZDollars 2.51. Independent Newspapers moved up 25 cents to NZDollars 5.55 on rumours that News Corp might sell part of its 49 per cent holding. MANILA closed stronger on bargain hunting. The composite index gained 20.75 at 1,453.79, with Philippine Long Distance Telephone ahead 20 pesos at 1,025 pesos. Combined turnover declined to 313.7m pesos from 371.6m pesos. KUALA LUMPUR rose in heavy trading, with interest focused on speculative stocks. The composite index moved up 3.63 to 608.79. Extended trading hours, which began yesterday, contributed to the high volume of 166m shares. BANGKOK's SET index added 3.71 at 757.96 in low turnover of Bt6.42bn. Advancing issues outpaced losers by 139 to 71.</p>

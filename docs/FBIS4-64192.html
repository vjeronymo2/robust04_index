			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Hans-Joachim Noack: "`I'm No Flighty </F> Airhead'--FDP Chairman Klaus Kinkel"]    [Text] On Tuesday morning [12 April] of last week at his  house in Sankt Augustin, the FDP [Free Democratic Party] chief  and foreign minister, Klaus Kinkel, leafs through the press  clippings sent from Bonn with a certain trepidation. Then he is  happy.    The media echo which appears to him "predominantly positive"  concerns a far-reaching decision. The previous day, the Free  Democratic Party presidium promised to remain faithful to its  coalition partner also for the future legislative period--a  decision made for the chairman's sake.    "This was very clearly my initiative," says the lawyer who  has been leading the Liberals since last June; and that is  certainly true. As a last step, he had tied his "foster father,"  Hans-Dietrich Genscher, into the plan of quick determination.    Although the FDP leadership team will make the formal  declaration only on Monday in Bonn's Thomas-Dehler House, the  honorary chairman already trumpeted the news on the previous  weekend: "If the SPD [Social Democratic Party] presents itself  as the CDU [Christian Democratic Union] with a red shawl," he  asks at a land party congress of the Mecklenburg-West Pomerian  Free Democrats in Binz on the island of Ruegen, "why should we  not stay with the original?"    At this point, Genscher and company have long been aware  that  a turnaround in coalition strategy would hopelessly overtax the  bourgois-conservative Kinkel. Probably a fitting assessment.    And the Swabian [Kinkel], fussy about his reputation,  basically sees it the same way. After the "blow of liberation"  has been secretly agreed upon, a party chief emerges at the  Ruegen Baltic Sea spa who inspires the delegates at least  somewhat. He will now make his "handwriting" clear and "roll up  his shirtsleeves."    He will need to. Since the botched elections in Lower Saxony  and Schleswig Holstein, the 57-year-old administrative lawyer  from Hechingen is in a bad position. Barely 10 months ago,  Genscher still had praised him as the "personified  confidence-building measure" for his party. But that no longer  counts.    The Liberal chief feels affronted by harsh judgments by  political thinkers who are quite favorably disposed toward the  FDP's cause. Recently, political scientist Arnulf Baring called  him to his face "an amateur actor at whom the country is  beginning to laugh." He may have used the wrong tone, but he  reflects the basic mood of his sympathizers: Klaus Kinkel, who  during his years as a civil servant enjoyed the reputation of a  competent careerist, is increasingly seen as flustered.  Naturally, such accusations outrage him. "One has to stand still  for that," he reacts quiveringly, while in his Bonn ministerial  office he hits his crossed legs with the edge of his hand. What  has he perpetrated that he, who "kept himself free of all  scandals," is thus losing respect?    "I am no flighty airhead," the party chairman defends  himself, pointing to his solid character--and that is precisely  where the misunderstandings crop up. Where the press, for  instance, subjects the confused top politican to harsh criticism  in the current nonstop election year, Kinkel feels himself  persecuted "as a human being." He is being "mercilessly reviled."    But in truth, there is another part of his nature, the lover  of power who, if necessary, is not very squeamish. In his role  as chief of the Foreign Office, after all, he has managed to  enlarge the European house "with a sledgehammer" (DIE ZEIT).    Does it bother him that, after "summoning" the French  ambassador in Bonn, the Paris LE QUOTIDIEN DE PARIS huffily  spoke of a "rugby player?" "No, what's that all about?" He, as  the foreign minister of an enlarged Germany, must not be seen  "as some half-hearted fellow."    But the task of representing the chancellor's fatherland in  the world is one thing--a fundamentally different one is the  difficult job of taking in hand a miniparty disintegrating into  innumerable particles. And Klaus Kinkel knows that. "As Foreign  Office chief, no one bests me," says the FDP chief, thereby  acknowledging that his effective power [as party chairman] is  still limited at present.    Hence the leader of liberals tries to copy the foreign  minister move by move--his forward push in the coalition  decision is to him the first proof of that. Because now they are  going to really get started. The FDP, roars the speaker in Binz  so that his cheeks grow red with fury, must "finally become less  accommodating, must give offense...we have been too goody-goody!"    After the weeks of inner tension, now a kind of political  convalescent presents himself who calls for the offensive, also  on subject matters. Resolutely, as if the Count [Lambsdorff]  were still sitting at the head of the table, the Lambsdorff heir  propagates a clearcut lobby strategy. The nets are cast to lure  small- and medium-sized business in particular. The key word  "elite" appears in almost all of Kinkel's "guidelines."    Since it is a matter of survival, the liberal gymnast  tickles  the old reflexes back to life. In his opinion, for too long the  FDP has catered also to those "who don't vote for us anyway"--so  let there be an end to it. The Free Democratic identity invoked  by Kinkel now again unabashedly limits itself to taking the side  of the "better and more industrious" people in the country.    May the CDU and SPD, which he calls "tankers," get stuck in  society's "pack ice": He, the helmsman of the "smaller and  nimbler ship" tries to steer his own clientele out of the danger  zone.  <H5>  "If I Should Really Have No Luck At All..." </H5>   But his "struggle" to regain for the FDP a profile which at  present is "somewhat blurred," at the same time shows the  characteristics of artificiality. For the sake of power sharing,  he is about to prescribe for his party the former support corset  of an exaggerated economic liberalism, and pays for it the price  of damaging his self-image. That has demanded of him to date to  also see himself as an "advocate of the weak."    "That is a fundamental contradiction," he says a bit  wearily,  "with which I have to live," and at such moments one feels the  burden pressing on the chairman. He not only considers it  important to somehow be all things to all people. This educated  citizen with a tendency toward brooding meditations also wants  to claim for himself being at home in all emotional situations.    Kinkel as a show-off superstar, and Kinkel in the pose of  the  delicately strung thinker: "I personally," he says, braced by  visits to the grass roots, "have strong nerves," and puffs out  his athletic chest--only to change to a bitterly plaintive tone  in the evening of the same day. There, he experiences himself  "as rather helpless in a problematical constellation."    That he did not push himself forward when it was a matter of  finding a successor for the party chairmanship is sufficiently  well-known--but he must emphasize it time and again. In Saxony's  Zwickau, the almost incidental question as to how he assesses  the present rather negative image of the FDP is already enough  to set him off. "Yes, yes, yes," drawls the one so addressed,  and he obviously feels himself attacked: He, "Kinkel," has spent  nights "sitting up in his bed until he finally became party  boss."    Can such a one succeed in not only lifting his atrophied and  emaciated liberals over the 5-percent hurdle, but also in  keeping them in the government? Had the foreign minister,  recently flying home from Russia above the clouds, not felt the  situation of party chairman Kinkel to be rather unfortunate? "If  I really should have no luck at all...," he complained at the  time.    The early presidium decision in favor of the alliance with  the CDU/CSU [Christian Social Union] thus also takes into  account the mentality of the FDP's top man. An unreliable  customer, plagued by scruples, tending toward ambivalence, and  unsure in the core of his role-playing, is to be stabilized.  This may not be a "blank check" for Kohl and his Christian  Democrats, as the blue-yellow rival pope Juergen Moellemann  denounces it--but at least Kinkel would hardly have been capable  of action without this agreement. Strategically not very  flexible, the FDP boss had for weeks considered any other  solution as an imposition.    At the beginning of the election campaign, someone like  Kinkel simply is incapable of, on the one hand, defending the  joint government work, "and then simultaneously justifying  leaving it." Win or lose, is now his motto. If he has slipped  up, "the fault is rightfully mine."    Since the partner has now been decided in principle, he  wants  to practice the art of "distinctive profiling." The magic word,  autonomy, is to be filled with life--a maxim, however, so far  only anchored in theory. It would be in favor of the chairman's  logic to now encourage his party to make a decision in the  election of the federal president free from coalition  calculations. But for that he still lacks the courage. He sees  himself "on a testing ground, trying to keep the outfit  together."    From the onset of his commitment as the liberal guiding  figure, the vacillating Swabian has been under suspicion of not  being able to make powerful counterdesigns in the ruling  bourgeois bloc. Irmgard Schwaetzer's mocking term, "FDP  appendage," upsets him; the chief is enraged by Moellemann's  constant needling that the alliance should have been cancelled,  at the latest over the elderly care insurance.    Has the party lost its contours because the chairman, as he  is being told more and more, is drowsing in fear of the  overwhelming chancellor? For Klaus Kinkel, all that is "pure  bunk." Anyone who wants to conscientiously probe his share in  Bonn's power, should "ask fat Kohl himself how difficult I am  for him."    A politician is fighting for his reputation. He, "Kinkel,"  says Kinkel, appearing strangely guileless, "in truth is much  more unpleasant than most people think."</p>

Abelenda] </F>   [Text] Luanda, 10 Jan (PL) -- On 10 January, Angolan  Foreign Minister Venacio da Moura described relations between  his country and Cuba, which he said are historical and  invariable, as excellent.    In an exclusive interview for PRENSA LATINA, da Moura said  the ties between Luanda and Havana have remained at a constant  level, as they are founded on solid relations based on mutual  respect between two sovereign states.    He added that cooperation continues to be privileged and  advantageous, but admitted that due to current conditions, the  economic ties have not reached the level both countries and  peoples would hope.    Commenting on the upcoming visit to Angola this week by his  Cuban counterpart, Roberto Robaina, da Moura said it is aimed at  seeking new ways to increase future cooperation, taking into  consideration the complex situation both countries are facing.    He added that Robaina's visit in Luanda will contribute to  "keeping alive the flame of solidarity that started when the  Cuban and Angolan people together shed their blood in defense of  Angola's sovereignty."    He stressed that despite the political and economic  transformations in Angola during the past three years as a  result of changes taking place in the world, the governments of  Luanda and Havana have tried to maintain bilateral relations at  the same level.    We would like those relations to be even better, he said,  but  the current war in Angola caused by the armed UNITA [National  Union for the Total Independence of Angola] organization, as  well as problems in Cuba due to the unjust commercial and  financial blockade it faces, to a large extent limit our  economic ties.    Nevertheless, he added, those difficulties have not  prevented  our mutual cooperation from growing. In no way have they  weakened that cooperation, and they will not be an obstacle to  continuing relations on the same path they have followed over  the past 20 years, he noted.    During the interview, da Moura stressed that the Angolan  Government will continue supporting and defending Cuba at all  international forums.    That has been and will continue to be our government's  position, he stressed.    Da Moura praised Cubans saying that "their firmness is their  best defense against the constant aggressions and difficulties  they have faced during the past years."    In Cuba's struggle against destabilizing actions a key  factor  has been the nation's solid leadership headed by President Fidel  Castro, da Moura concluded.</p>

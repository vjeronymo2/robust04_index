			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Nordic Markets in Turmoil: Sweden's limping economy takes a fresh body-blow AT 8pm on Monday Mr Carl Bildt, the Swedish prime minister, leaned back in his armchair at a London hotel and declared confidently that Sweden's interest rates were 'going to come down'. Roughly 12 hours later, the world knew differently. Mr Bildt flew back to Stockholm with his own political future looking even more complicated than when he left. The Bank of Sweden's drastic increase to defend the krona adds up to a further depressant on the Swedish economy. 'We had been thinking that, if we were lucky, we might get zero growth next year,' Mr Bjorn Jonsson, chief of economic analysis at Skandinaviska Enkilda Banken in Stockholm said yesterday. 'Now, it could be a minus.' The further dose of economic gloom comes as Sweden is endures its worst recession since the 1920s. This will increase pressure on Mr Bildt's minority conservative administration when it tries to push through parliament fresh cuts in spending to restrain the sharply rising budget deficit. Mr Bildt on Monday promised no let-up in Sweden's tough economic policy, which has brought inflation - at 2.2 per cent - to below the German level. He promised to cut social security further and to maintain the krona's link to the Ecu. 'The markets must be persuaded that we are going to stay on course ..This is not a recipe for being popular.' The firm line was repeated yesterday in Stockholm by Mrs Anne Wibble, the Swedish finance minister. Money market rates - to which much of Swedish corporate and personal loans are linked - yesterday showed a much smaller rise of up to 3 per cent. Swedish economists believe that, provided yesterday's action triggers the return of large flows of speculative capital, the Riksbank will be able to bring down interest rates again before long. If that does not happen, the pressures to lower the level of the krona will grow. This might take place as part of a general realignment of currencies within the European Monetary System, of which Sweden is not a member. According to Mr Ola Virin, chief economist at the Swedish Industry Federation, the main negative effect on business is the uncertainty caused by the two separate rounds of interest rate tightening. In view of competition between forest industries in Sweden and Finland, the markka devaluation could bring considerable problems for Swedish producers, he warned. Mr Nils Lundgrun, chief economist at Nordbanken in Stockholm, said the chief worries for business will arrive if the interest rate squeeze continues for more than about three weeks. A combination of a low dollar rate, a slow recovery in the US and Europe, and continued nervousness on the foreign exchanges could add up to a 'disastrous' outcome. WHAT THE INTEREST RATE RISE MEANS FOR SWEDEN Companies: Big companies can still borrow at prime lending rate (15.5 percent prior to yesterday's action).  Medium-and small-sized companies face greater uncertainty over funding.  All companies lose competitiveness against Finland. Individuals: Mortgage rate prior to rise 14 percent.  25 percent of mortgage loans linked to 3-month money market rate (+3 percent yesterday) 75 percent of mortgages linked to long-term capital market rate. Owner occupation rate above 40 percent. Economy: Economic contraction likely to continue into 1993.  Doubling of budget deficit to Skr 140m almost certain this fiscall year.  Government reaffirms policy of seeking more spending cuts.</p>

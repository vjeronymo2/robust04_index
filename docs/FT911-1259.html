			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Optimist owes a debt to business failure:  Michael Cassell discovers that the network of official receivers has rarely been busier MR George Barrow, as an appointed representative of the Lord Chancellor, is not often called upon to break into a Spanish bank's safe deposit box with a hammer and chisel. Mr Barrow, one of 29 official receivers in England and Wales, was in hot pursuit of an absentee company director and moved so quickly that he managed to arrive before his quarry in the fashionable holiday resort of Puerto Banus. A brief court appearance gave him permission to carry out his break-in, which yielded Pounds 35,000 in cash and some valuable property deeds. Encouraged by his unexpected bonanza, Mr Barrow used his brief spell in the sun to look up another fugitive. This time, however, his luck ran out and he was forced by a snarling dog to vault a villa wall. 'It took me half an hour to get into the grounds and 30 seconds to get out,' he said. With liquidations and bankruptcies likely to have reached a record 24,000 in 1990 and expected to rise further this year, private insolvency practices and the network of official receivers have rarely been busier. As a member of the government's insolvency service, part of the Department of Trade and Industry, Mr Barrow's initial role is to protect the assets of individual bankrupts and of companies in compulsory liquidation. He then investigates the circumstances surrounding their collapse, pursues prosecutions when necessary, and can also have directors disqualified from playing any part in most forms of business for up to 15 years. About 300 people a year are banned nationally, although they may trade again without the benefit of limited liability. In pursuit of his duties as an officer of the court, Mr Barrow has watched for 25 years as people and companies run out of cash, time and excuses. Most companies crash, Mr Barrow says, because they are undercapitalised or over-optimistic but he praises most of the risk takers, who simply get it wrong. 'I have a comfortable, secure job and am not about to criticise those who have had the guts to have a go.' There are some, however, who test his ingenuity to its limits - for instance, the bankrupt who lives in a Pounds 500,000 house conveniently owned by another member of the family and who claims he cannot pay his VAT bills; or the director who returns his leased computer system - still loaded with essential financial information - before the receiver calls. It seems there are few new tricks in the book. 'It is quite staggering to see the number of cars which are stolen with the company books inside. The cars are recovered but, for some reason, the fascinated thief keeps the books.' Mr Barrow has a daunting range of investigative powers and considerable discretion, encompassing almost everything except the authority to arrest. Working within the Insolvency Act 1986, implemented to tidy up a mish-mash of laws unchanged since 1914, he can call to the witness box anyone he chooses and has access to private and corporate bank records. The new legislation is generally seen as striking a fair balance between the interests of the bankrupt and those of the creditors. In the bad old days, failed businessmen had to sit down, empty their pockets and hand everything over to the receiver. 'We used to have a safe full of watches,' he says. 'Nowadays we would only take a Rolex.' Some of the businessmen he confronts are well-versed on their rights, such as the plumber who claimed that the removal of his BMW saloon was, contrary to the act, depriving him of the tools of his trade. Mr Barrow gave him Pounds 500 to buy an old van. Mr Barrow is the official receiver for much of the Midlands, the north-west and parts of Wales, and has offices in Stoke-on-Trent and Chester. He and his teams of examiners can act only on the order of a court, unlike private practices, which can be recruited by companies voluntarily seeking liquidation. His immediate task, on receiving a court order, is to close down any business premises - thereby protecting the bankrupt from unsecured creditors  -and to take responsibility for all assets involved, for which he is personally liable. Mr Barrow can pay staff up to eight weeks' back pay, as well as redundancy money to help soften the blow of what is often sudden, unexpected unemployment. He is critical of creditors, invariably government departments such as the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise, which choose not to seek redress via the bailiffs but regard the receiver's office as the state debt collector. 'It is infuriating to find that, if they had only knocked on the door, they need not have burdened us,' he says. Most cases are concluded quickly, without the need for further action by his department. Last year, his team carried out investigations into 10 per cent of notified bankrupts and 25 per cent of failed companies. Only a small proportion result in prosecution. Being surrounded by failure has not made Mr Barrow pessimistic: there are happy endings. Three weeks ago, he discreetly impounded a vintage Ferrari, one of three insured collectively for Pounds 1.8m. 'The team which took it away wore silk gloves so as not to scratch it. But the owner came up with the money to pay his debts and we took it straight back.'</p>

The Iraqi  Awqaf minister expressed his thanks to the king, people and  Government of Jordan for their pan-Arab stands and their support  for various Arab issues that reinforce Arab solidarity. He said  the Arab and Islamic delegations were eager to take part in the  Kingdom's celebrations of the third Hashemite-sponsored  renovation of the holy Dome of the Rock.

			<p><P> June 8, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 6 SIS DETECTIVES CLEARED IN SHOOTING OF BANK ROBBERS  </P> <P> In an important legal victory for the Los Angeles Police Department, a federal  court jury Thursday cleared six undercover detectives of allegations that they  violated a bank robber's civil rights when they shot her and killed her  companion after watching the two rob a bank in 1982.  </P> <P> The jury deliberated for 2 hours and 45 minutes before finding that the four  detectives who shot Jane Berry had not used excessive force. The verdict meant  an automatic dismissal of the case against the two remaining detectives, both  since retired, who did not participate in the shooting, but supervised the  operation.  </P> <P> All the detectives are members and former members of the LAPD's Special  Investigations Section, an elite surveillance squad that gathers evidence  against dangerous criminals by watching them commit crimes and attempts to  arrest them afterward. The unit, which has killed more than 25 suspects and  wounded at least 24 others since its inception in 1967, is so clandestine that  few knew of its existence until a 1988 investigative article by The Times.  </P> <P> Berry's $10-million civil case marked the first time members of the unit --  which her lawyers have repeatedly referred to as "a death squad" -- have been  brought to trial as a group. Had she prevailed, Berry would have been able to  continue her case with a second, wider-ranging phase that named Police Chief  Daryl F. Gates, Mayor Tom Bradley and other city officials and alleged that the  very policy that permits the SIS to exist is a violation of civil rights.  </P> <P> In addition, a verdict in favor of Berry could have cleared the way for others  to file similar suits.  </P> <P> Berry's lawyers, Stephen and Marion Yagman, have already filed suit on behalf  of the families of three men who were shot to death by SIS officers after a  robbery at a McDonald's restaurant in Sunland last February.  </P> <P> "We'll get the death squad in the next case," Marion Yagman said after  Thursday's verdict.  </P> <P> But Assistant City Atty. Victoria Chaney, who represented the officers, said  she believed the verdict Thursday "would be a signal to other people that they  ought to think carefully about filing a lawsuit against police officers who  place their lives on the line every day in dealing with dangerous criminals."  </P> <P> The officers, who have never been charged with any crime in the shootings, were  clearly relieved and elated at the outcome of the civil trial. After the  verdicts were announced at 7 p.m., they hugged one another and shook hands.  Some even broke the silence they had maintained throughout the two-week trial.  </P> <P> "I was worried if the verdict was different that maybe, in the future, it would  affect how I work," said Detective Jerry Brooks, his wife at his side. "That  maybe I would end up taking a second longer and I would end up dead."  </P> <P> Detective Michael Sirk, meanwhile, said he felt the squad had been vindicated,  although he added he was never worried about its continued existence.  </P> <P> "I don't think Chief Gates will get rid of the SIS, no matter what lawsuits  come up," Sirk said. "He has reassured us that we have his backing . . . that  our jobs are secure no matter which way any decisions go."  </P> <P> In addition to the support of their chief, the six SIS detectives -- Brooks and  Sirk, Rodger Niles, Henry Cadena and retired officers Dale Ostrom and Roger  Marine -- had plenty of support from their fellow squad members and other  police officers, who packed the courtroom during closing arguments Thursday.  According to Chaney, every member of the 19-man SIS unit listened in on some  portion of the case.  </P> <P> Trial testimony showed that the SIS shadowed Berry and her companion, John  Crumpton, for 17 days before watching them rob a Security Pacific Bank in  Burbank on Sept. 15, 1982.  </P> <P> Berry's lawyers maintained that police had ample opportunity to arrest Berry  and Crumpton before the robbery on lesser charges and had, in effect, created a  situation that was bound to end in gunfire.  </P> <P> Pointing to physical evidence that showed Berry and Crumpton each sustained  numerous shotgun pellet wounds -- all to the back -- Stephen Yagman told the  jury in his closing argument that the officers "ambushed" the two. "They wanted  to put them out of business forever," Yagman said.  </P> <P> The officers, however, maintained that they acted in self-defense, saying they  saw Berry reach for her gun and thought -- albeit mistakenly -- that Crumpton  was also armed.  </P> <P> Jurors said afterward that they sided with the officers because Berry's  testimony lacked credibility and because the judge had instructed them to  determine only whether the officers used excessive force.  </P> <P> "There's only one point of the case, and that was the final seconds," said one  juror who asked not to be named. "That's what the judge told us. That's what we  went by."  </P></p>

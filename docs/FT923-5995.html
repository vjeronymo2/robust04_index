			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Arts: The London Philharmonic - Edinburgh International Festival IN A country proud of its ancient customs, there seems to be a tradition in the making: an annual visit to the Edinburgh Festival by one of the London orchestras. This year the honour fell to the London Philharmonic - an honour, as it was allowed to programme the central German classics, while the hard work of preparing the festival's rarities was left to supposedly lesser visitors. So exalted a position should not be claimed easily. Even in a festival that can no longer lure (or afford) the prestigious Berlin and Vienna orchestras, the competition is fierce. It was unfortunate for the London Philharmonic that it should have appeared hard on the heels of the St Petersburg Philharmonic, which had left ears tingling, passions roused, hearts elated. The London orchestra's playing was not on that level. Its festival visit comprised a pair of concerts at the Usher Hall, one each under the orchestra's past and present music directors, Klaus Tennstedt and Franz Welser-Most. Among the audiences, there was some disagreement as to which of the two was the stronger. I have no doubts. Both for maturity of musicianship and sheer quality of sound, it was Tennstedt's evening that lifted the spirits. The playing did not exhibit the pungent clarity of the Russians, or their exhilarating passion. But the depth of tone, reaching molten-like to the orchestra's core, is in itself a distinctive feature, which it seems only Tennstedt can draw from the London Philharmonic players. His two Beethoven works, the Overture to Egmont and the Seventh Symphony, were both rock-firm, wise, sensitive, impressive in their unhurried determination to plumb the music to its foundations. In Strauss's Four Last Songs, the music's beauties were indulged in a still more leisurely fashion. Tennstedt's grand, romantic vision ideally demands a soprano of limitless tonal opulence, which Felicity Lott did her noble best to provide. The gap between the last two chords was so long that one feared the audience would applaud too soon. The other concert, on Monday under Welser-Most, was a very different affair. The single work on the programme was Bruckner's Eighth Symphony. So often seen as a slow and reflective symphonic journey best left to older conductors, the piece was here turned on its head. Welser-Most is a young man and he made of it a young man's music. Within 10 minutes, the first movement was a frenzy of brass fanfares and string tremolandos; the opening of the finale foretold a battle of giants. This was the symphony as drama. As befits a performance in the city of John Knox, Bruckner's deep-seated spirituality took on a harder edge, arguing in impassioned debate, celebrating with brass chorales of lacerating loudness and ferocity. To my ears, the performance entirely lacked dignity and radiant beauty, the essential Bruckner virtues. Concerts sponsored by the Friends of the Edinburgh International Festival and Scottish Life</p>

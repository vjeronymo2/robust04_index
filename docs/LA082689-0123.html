			<p><P> August 26, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MCDONNELL DOUGLAS ROCKET NEARS LIFTOFF  </P> <P> If all goes according to schedule, a McDonnell Douglas Corp. Delta rocket will  lift off from Cape Canaveral early Sunday evening, propelling a British  broadcasting satellite into orbit and the United States into the  rough-and-tumble market for commercial launches into space.  </P> <P> The field is now dominated by the European rocket consortium Arianespace. But  U.S. companies have been preparing for a run from behind since 1986, when  President Reagan created new demand for commercial launches by effectively  banning nongovernment cargo from future space shuttle flights after the  Challenger explosion.  </P> <P> McDonnell Douglas' scheduled launch will be the first lift-off under the new  policy. The company will be in full command of the pad and will shoulder any  financial liability in the event of an accident.  </P> <P> The Delta is designed and partially built by McDonnell Douglas' Space Systems  Co. in Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> McDonnell Douglas has signed up nine commercial customers, including the  British satellite company, with each launch contract worth about $50 million.  </P> <P> Two other U.S. companies have been working hard to enter the market. Martin  Marietta Corp. plans the first commercial launch of its Titan rocket later this  year, while General Dynamics Corp. has plans to send up its first commercial  Atlas next June.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Daunting Competition  </P> <P> The companies face daunting competition from abroad, despite the U.S.'s  traditional leadership in space exploration. And they are entering the market  at a time when the number of launches is lower than was predicted when they  began gearing up. "There's more supply than demand," said Judith Comeau, a vice  president of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., New York, who watches the aerospace  industry. "It's very simple."  </P> <P> Arianespace, launching from a complex in the jungle of French Guyana, has built  an impressive record: 15 successful launches in 15 tries since September, 1987,  when it ended a yearlong grounding that was called after a launch failure. It  has had the commercial field all to itself for the last two years and holds an  estimated two-thirds or more of the market for the next year or so.  </P> <P> In addition, China's Long March booster and the Soviet Union's Proton are being  offered to the world for rides into space at prices sufficiently lower than  those to be charged by U.S. companies. That has left the American firms  complaining that these governments are unfairly subsidizing the aerospace  companies in their countries. Further down the road, Japan is expected to  introduce a large booster, the H-2, for its own satellite payloads and possible  entry into the world market in the 1990s, which would create further  competition for the three American players.  </P> <P> "I don't think there's enough business on a commercial basis (alone) to enable  all three companies to remain viable in the face of increasing foreign  competition," said Brad Meslin, managing director of CSP Associates Inc., a  Cambridge, Mass., firm that consults on the aerospace business. But Meslin  suggested that the three would probably be able to stay in the market due to  revenues from separate noncommercial rocket business with the U.S. military.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Leader of the Pack  </P> <P> General Dynamics, with firm contracts for 17 commercial launches, is viewed as  leading the pack among the American three. "We feel pretty confident that the  decision we made to go into the commercial launch services business is really  proving to be a good business decision," said Jack Isabel, a General Dynamics  spokesman.  </P> <P> Contributing to this story was David Olmos, Times staff writer.  </P></p>

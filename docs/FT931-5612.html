			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Kantor supports 'new trade rules' THE US will support 'new rules of engagement' for international trade in a world undergoing 'global transition', Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, said last night. In his first public policy address since taking office, he talked of a 'new set of standards about what is productive behaviour'. He and President Bill Clinton, who spoke on trade last Friday, have yet to define the new rules and standards they will seek, and probably have yet to devise them. But they are certain to recast the debate. 'We intend to avoid getting bogged down in long theological debates about free trade and protectionism. It is a senseless exercise and ultimately futile,' Mr Kantor told semiconductor industry executives. Like its predecessor, the Clinton administration fully supports completion of the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks, but not 'simply to show progress after so many years of effort.' It must have real gains and leave the US the ability 'to rigorously enforce our trade laws', Mr Kantor said. The administration wants Japan and Europe to take on 'new responsibilities in return for the opportunity to compete in the new world economy'. The US-Japan semiconductor agreement is a case in point, Mr Kantor said. 'We are resolute and determined to get results' from the 1991 trade pact, which promised foreign chipmakers greater access to the Japanese market. He said he would monitor market share data to determine compliance with the market-opening agreement in which Japan recognised US expectations that the foreign share of the Japanese chip market should rise above 20 per cent by the end of last year. Mr Kantor is expected to take a firm line so as not to show weakness in his first confrontation with Japan. If, as expected, the 20 per cent market share target is not reached, he could impose sanctions. However, the Japanese are expected to make proposals aimed to avoid them. The 14 per cent EC tariff on semiconductors was rarely mentioned during the Bush administration. Mr Kantor, though, gave it high visibility. 'We find it unacceptable that the EC remains reluctant to eliminate the tariff,' he said, adding that the latest EC offer to lower tariffs to 7 per cent was unacceptable.</p>

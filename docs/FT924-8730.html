			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Congress leaders jostle for power: After the election, the race is on to join the purse-strings committees THE transition team of President-elect Bill Clinton is moving cautiously towards the creation of a new administration, but in the legislative branch of the US government, congressional leaders are wasting no time regrouping after last week's elections. New senators flew to Washington yesterday to be sworn in, and Speaker Thomas Foley went with other Democratic leaders to Chicago to meet the House of Representatives' new intake. While the new members were being inducted, the veterans of Capitol Hill were already jockeying for position. House members began yesterday picking over - in strict order of seniority - the list of vacant office suites, and elections are due to be held today for several key Senate party posts. Most of the posts are uncontested, but a fierce, if covert, battle is being waged by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky to oust Senator Phil Gramm of Texas from the chairmanship of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which Mr Gramm has used to launch his 1996 presidential campaign. Most critical of all, however, is the allocation of committee assignments next month, with an unusual number of open seats on the prized financial committees up for grabs. The committees that preside over taxation and spending - the House ways and means committee and the Senate finance committee for taxation, and the appropriations committees of both chambers for spending - wield enormous influence because of their control over the purse strings. The Senate appropriations committee has seen relatively little turnover, but 13 of the 59 members of the House appropriations committee have retired and six more were defeated in primaries or elections. They include three chairmen of the subcommittees that control spending in specific sectors. Among those stepping up will be Congressman Bob Carr of Michigan, expected to become head of the transportation subcommittee, and Congressman Louis Stokes of Ohio, who will take over the veterans, housing and independent agencies subcommittee, which includes the space budget in its domain. One critical question is the future of 82-year-old Congressman Jamie Whitten, who chairs the full appropriations committee and its agriculture subcommittee. He was compelled by illness during the last Congress to hand over day-to-day responsibilities to Congressman William Natcher of Kentucky, a year older but much fitter. Some Democrats are urging a breach of the normal seniority rules to place a younger member, such as Congressman David Obey of Wisconsin, in the committee's chair. The senior Republican on appropriations, Congressman Joseph McDade of Pennsylvania, could also be ousted because of his recent indictment on charges of bribery. No such coup is expected against Congressman Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of ways and means, but of his committee's 36 members, 13 have left Congress. The selection of new members to replace them will be particularly important because of ways and means' jurisdiction over health care issues, which are expected to be high on the agenda of both the Clinton administration and the new Congress.</p>

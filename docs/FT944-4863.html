			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Survey of Japanese Industry (13): A particularly heated argument - Trade conflict between Tokyo and the US In the latest round of trade negotiations between Japan and the US, one of the main arguments the US has mustered against Japan has been that internationally competitive US companies would have greater success in Japan if its markets were truly open. The majority of sectors which US trade officials have cited as problem trade areas with Japan are those in which US companies have demonstrated competitiveness in other world markets but have, by and large, failed to make significant inroads in Japan. The predicament of US telecommunications equipment makers trying to sell in Japan is a case in point. 'US telecom manufacturers are among the most competitive in the world,' the US government states in a paper on the framework negotiations. Yet the Japanese market, particularly in the area of government procurement, has been largely closed to foreign, including US, telecoms companies. The closed nature of Japan's telecoms market can be seen from the fact that while other Group of Seven countries import about 25 per cent of their telecommunications needs, Japan imported just 5 per cent in 1992, the US argues. 'This imbalance stems from the obstacles foreign firms encounter in attempting to participate in the Japanese public sector procurement market,' the US government says. Not only have foreign companies lacked access to information which is provided to Japanese companies, they have been disadvantaged by practices such as sole sourcing and discriminatory tender specifications. The same goes for the medical equipment market. US manufacturers account for 40 per cent of the public and private market in the European Union, but less than half that in the Japanese market, Mr Mickey Kantor US Trade Representative Ambassador has stated. The argument that US industry, despite its international competitiveness, is prevented from penetrating Japan's markets, becomes a particularly heated one when applied to the vehicle industry. US frustration about its inability to make a wider mark in Japan's vehicle market has intensified over the past few years not only because two-thirds of the near-Dollars 60bn annual US trade deficit with Japan stems from vehicles and vehicle parts, but increasingly because of a renewed confidence in the US industry's competitiveness vis-a-vis Japanese vehicle makers. 'The US has re-emerged as the world's largest producer of automobiles,' noted Ms Joan Spero, US under-secretary of state for economic and agricultural affairs, in a speech earlier this year. The quality of US cars is also seen to have improved markedly. US companies 'are getting the quality message too. (They) have been making a serious effort to improve the quality of the goods and services they produce, and it shows,' Ms Spero said. Surveys in the US indicate that a growing number of Americans now believe American cars are even better than Japanese cars. On top of their increased competitiveness, US vehicle companies have stepped up efforts to penetrate the Japanese market. Yet the closed nature of the Japanese vehicle market has worked to frustrate such efforts. Foreign vehicle manufacturers lack access to information on the car market, come up against regulations and business practices which hinder sales of foreign-made car parts to the after-market in Japan, and the close relationships which tie dealers to Japanese car makers. The situation is blamed for the small share, about 3 per cent, that foreign, including US, vehicle makers had for long been relegated to in the Japanese market against the 20 to 30 per cent share which Japanese companies have recently enjoyed in the US. Although the foreign share of Japan's vehicle market has risen substantially closer to about 10 per cent this year, this has owed more to a favourable exchange rate and intensified marketing by foreign companies rather than improvements in market access. Improved US competitiveness in cars and other industries means that 'the old rhetoric in Japan - the rhetoric that says that the trade deficit is America's fault because of our low product quality or because our companies don't try hard enough to export - that rhetoric simply does not ring true any more,' Ms Spero asserts. This argument has been used to support US claims that Japanese markets do not function like 'normal' markets do in free trade economies and was behind a 'results-oriented' approach adopted by the administration of President Clinton. However, as the year-long experience of the bilateral framework negotiations made clear, the US approach failed to win widespread public support not only in Japan but in Europe, Asia and even in the US. While many people, including Japanese businessmen, would no doubt agree that competitive US companies probably face greater obstacles in Japan than they would in most other industrialised countries, the results-oriented approach advocated by the Clinton trade team raised suspicions that it would benefit mainly specific companies in chosen industries which the US government had deemed competitive. After bilateral agreements were reached in November in most of the priority sectors, that suspicion remains. This month, Sir Leon Brittan, European Commissioner for External Relations, voiced concern that the bilateral agreements would benefit US companies at the expense of European ones. In a recent report, Ms Mineko Sasaki-Smith, economist at Morgan Stanely, the US investment bank, argues that the benefits from the framework agreements 'may accrue to individual firms in the targeted sectors but are unlikely to have a major impact on the big picture of Japan's trade-current account surplus.' In fact, based on rough, hypothetical estimates, the bilateral agreements are likely to cut the US trade deficit with Japan by just Dollars 404m - or less than 1 per cent - she notes. Many economists and public officials agree that a far more effective approach to reducing Japan's surplus would be to stimulate domestic demand through deregulation measures that would create a level playing field for foreign companies in Japan. After a year of battling against widespread public criticism of its results-oriented approach, and having reached agreements on some of the most contentious issues in the framework talks, the US government now appears to be channeling its energies in that direction. It has submitted to the Japanese government a detailed list of deregulation and administrative reform measures which it states 'can. . . provide greater market access for foreign goods, services and investment and. . . generally promote the domestic demand-led growth of the Japanese economy.'</p>

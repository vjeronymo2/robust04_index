Almost exactly four years ago this day, that is to say still  before the restoration of German unity, we met for our first  round of talks. Since then these regular meetings between  representatives of the business community, the trade unions, and  the federal and laender authorities have helped to analyze  pressing problems regarding the development in eastern Germany  and to initiate solutions.    The comprehensive structural changes are still fully under  way. Out of almost 10 million jobs more than 3 million have been  lost -- with all the hardships unemployment causes for those  affected.    People have had to adapt to completely new living  circumstances at breathtaking speed. Four decades of separation  and such differing living conditions have left deep marks. In  the history of a nation 40 years is a short period. Yet, for  millions of people, this period constitutes a considerable part  -- the best years in many cases -- of their lives. Thus, it is  all the more important today to give the people a concrete  perspective for their future.    Looking back at what we have achieved so far, we can say  that  on our path to completing the economic and social unity of  Germany we have made good progress despite all the difficulties.  We have been able to disconnect to a large degree the economic  development in the new laender from the recession in western  Germany. This year we expect the economy in the new laender to  grow between 6 and 8 percent in real terms.    More than 600,000 businesses have been set up and thousands  of enterprises reprivatized, which shows that the will to  independence has developed very dynamically in the new laender.  I would like to express my gratitude and respect to the  entrepreneurs in the new laender. Their courage to embark on  the course of self-employment with great resolution,  particularly in this era of great changes, deserves our great  respect and our strong support.    The Federal Government is firmly determined to continue its  policy of massive investment promotion at a high level. Since  unification, government promotion has led to a total of about  190 billion German marks [DM] in private investment.    Rapid investment is the key to success for developing  eastern  Germany. Existing enterprises must be modernized and new  competitive enterprises established. This is the really  promising path to create lasting jobs in eastern Germany. The  necessary economic reconstruction is supported by private  investors to a significant degree. Investment and purchasing  promises, which the west German economy provided within the  framework of the solidarity pact, also have been helpful.    In my view it is of particular importance that in the coming  year there will again be a sufficient number of places for  apprentices. I do not want to elaborate on this issue today.  Nevertheless, I hope we will all try as hard as we can in this  connection. There will be talks with the economic associations  and the trade unions in due course to produce another  large-scale private training initiative. It does not make any  sense to panic again and to call for public funds in this regard.    I am sure we agree that a sizable contribution by the German  credit sector will be essential in order to achieve the  difficult restructuring of the east German economy. I am  starting from the assumption that the promise of an additional  DM1 billion, provided by the credit sector within the framework  of the solidarity pact for the privatization of those Trust  Agency enterprises that are capable of being salvaged, continues  to apply and will be implemented. This is also a question of  the banks' credibility.    I am well aware that taking over Trust Agency enterprises  may  be quite difficult. Nevertheless, I would be glad if, despite  these difficulties, the talks between the banking sector and the  Trust Agency were to lead to positive results in the next few  weeks.    Ladies and Gentlemen, those who travel frequently to the new  laender -- as I do -- and visit enterprises and factories there  can be convinced that what is being built there are  state-of-the-art production plants -- also by international  standards. I am thinking, for example, of the new computer  plant in Thuringia, of Europe's most modern automobile plant,  new, highly efficient printing centers, or a factory for the  construction of a new generation of aircraft engines. Every  investor who comes to eastern Germany also takes the most  progressive technology and latest know-how there.    Public as well as private investment per capita is  meanwhile higher than in western Germany, and investment  activities are still increasing in the new laender. For 1994,  the Ifo economic research institute expects investment spending  to increase by 15 percent to a level of more than DM160 billion.  This is investment in the future of all of Germany.    It is the declared objective of the Federal Government to  support as strongly as possible development of independent and  competitive industry in eastern Germany. In the course of our  talks, Minister Rexrodt will present an interim balance in this  connection.    For the successful establishment of modern economic  structures we also must create the bases for an efficient energy  supply that is adequate for eastern Germany as economic center.  One important subject in this connection is the privatization  of the east German electricity enterprises and of brown coal  production.    I would like to ask the representatives of the Trust Agency  and the electricity producers to discuss this issue in the  course of our meeting. In this connection I would like to  welcome most warmly the representatives of the U.S.-British  group that bought Mitteldeutsche Braunkohle AG.    We expect that the billions that will be invested in the  energy sector will also provide an essential contribution to the  upswing in eastern Germany. Enterprises in the new laender  should benefit from the orders for this investment to as large a  degree as possible.    Ladies and Gentlemen, we are one country. Germany will only  prosper when we all prosper. Hence, overcoming the recession in  the western laender is also of the utmost importance for the  continuation of the upswing in the new laender.    There are many signs that indicate that the economic  recession is bottoming out and that recovery is gradually  starting. The recession, has, however also laid bare structural  problems whose elimination must no longer be put off. Necessary  reforms have been neglected for decades. This applies to such  important issues as railroad and postal reform, which we have  now set in motion.    These structural problems in the west are problems of the  old  FRG. They have nothing to do with German unity. On the  contrary, the profound structural changes in the new laender  are, at the same time, also increasing the chances for renewal  in western Germany.    Ladies and Gentlemen, one result of the recession and  structural problems was that more than 4 million people in  Germany have so far lost their jobs. This is depressing for me  and for all of us. Nobody must remain indifferent when people  become unemployed. Our most important joint duty is to secure  employment and to create jobs.    What we need now more than ever is the readiness to change  our way of thinking and to act. The political, business, and  trade union communities all have the obligation to meet their  responsibilities and to help secure employment and create new  jobs.    With its report on securing the future of Germany as an  economic center, the Federal Government last September presented  a clear action program for more growth and employment. The  public reaction to the report has been more than encouraging.    The Federal Government with great energy and swiftness began  to implement measures to improve Germany as an economic center  that were contained in the report. In addition, in January, we  agreed on an action program for more growth and employment.  These measures are also being implemented.    With these steps, once more, we are increasing the pace to  secure the future of Germany as an economic center. These are  important decisions needed to set the course for creating  several hundreds of thousands of new jobs in the short and  medium terms. In six months, more than two-thirds of the almost  90 measures that the Federal Government still envisaged for this  legislative term have been implemented or successfully launched.    The Federal Government is firmly determined to advance the  implementation of further difficult measures even during the  election campaign period. This will force us to make further  efforts. I know that more and more people understand that these  measures are indispensable. I would like to invite all of you  to embark on this course together and act accordingly!</p>

			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / International Company News: Gota Bank loss climbs to SKr2.4bn GOTA BANK, the troubled Swedish bank under state control, saw its operating loss deepen to SKr2.4bn (Dollars 306m) in 1992 from SKr1.9bn a year earlier after credit losses more than tripled to SKr12.5bn from SKr3.7bn. The loss would have been SKr12.9bn without SKr4.5bn in financial insurance and SKr6bn in state guarantees. The bank said its capital adequacy ratio at the year-end stood at 8.46 per cent, although it noted that without state support its capital base would have been negative. The government agreed last month to provide a total of SKr10bn in guarantees to Gota, so it has some additional loss coverage for the current year. Credit losses ballooned well beyond the SKr8bn level predicted last September when it first became apparent that the bank would need state support. The bank said 96 per cent of its credit losses arose from the corporate and financial sector, and 59 per cent of this total was related to real estate. It said just 15 loss engagements accounted for 38 per cent of total credit losses. Gota did not provide a forecast for 1993.</p>

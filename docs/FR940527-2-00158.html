			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Energy Sub proposes to acquire up to 100% of the common stock of Sacramento Power, Inc. (``Project Venture''), a Delaware corporation engaged in the development, construction, operation, and maintenance, and possible ownership of, an independent energy facility known as the Sacramento Power Cogeneration Project (``Project'') to be located in or near Sacramento, California, The Project will be a 148.5 megawatt, gas-fired qualifying cogeneration facility or an exempt wholesale generator, as defined in section 32 of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, two individuals, Arnold R. Klann and Leslie C. Confair, are equal owners of all of the 500 shares of common stock, no par value, of Project Venture. Energy Sub will acquire 500 shares of new common stock, no par value, that are to be issued by the Project Venture and may acquire up to 100% of the shares currently owned by Klann and Confair, for $1 per share or an aggregate amount of up to $1,000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Project Venture may be reorganized as a limited liability company under Nevada, Texas or California law. Accordingly, the Applicants propose to purchase the securities of the Project Venture or exchange any shares held at the time of such reorganization, as appropriate, in the event it is reorganized. The total purchase price paid by Energy Sub for the reorganized Project Venture would not exceed $1,000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Project Venture and Joint Venture have entered into a development agreement (``Development Agreement'') with the Sacramento Municipal District Financing Authority (``Municipal Authority''), a public agency established by the Sacramento Municipal Utility District. Under the Development Agreement, the Joint Venture and Project Venture are to provide services to the Project in two phases: Development (``Phase I'') and construction (``Phase II''). <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  Joint Venture will perform services only in Phase I. The Project Venture is obligated to enter into an engineering, procurement and construction agreement with a nationally recognized engineering and construction firm. The Project Venture proposes to enter into such an agreement with The Babcock &amp; Wilcox Company. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Project Venture has also made certain performance and completion guarantees with respect to the Project, noncompliance with which would result in assessment of liquidated damages against the Project Venture up to a maximum amount of $25 million. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> During Phase I, the Municipal Authority may terminate the Development Agreement for its own convenience or as a result of a default by the Joint Venture or the Project Venture under the Development Agreement. However, if the Municipal Authority terminates the Development Agreement for reasons unrelated to a default by the Project Venture, for example for its own convenience or where it is in default under the Development Agreement, the Project Venture has the option (``Option'') to terminate its involvement in the Project or, alternatively, to retain all Project assets and assume all of the Municipal Authority's rights in and to the Project, including the right to complete construction of the Project and to own and operate the Project. Accordingly, the Applicants seek authority for Project Venture to exercise the Option to retain the Project Assets, to complete construction of the Project as necessary and to own and operate the Project. The exercise of the Option shall require no fee or other consideration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Phase II of the Project, construction, would commence after the Municipal Authority has obtained third party construction and term financing for the Project. After completion of construction and start-up of the Project, the Municipal Authority will pay the Project Venture a ``base purchase price,'' based on the Project's actual electrical generation capacity, of no less than $84,064,000 and no more than $111,751,500. In addition, the Municipal Authority will pay the Project Venture $4.75 million for services rendered pursuant to the terms of a subordinated note in the same principal amount. The Municipal Authority will execute and deliver the subordinated note to the Project Venture at the completion of the Project. After start-up of the Project, the Project Venture will also provide operations and maintenance services for the Project. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As of December 31, 1993, the Joint Venture has incurred development expenses of approximately $6.7 million. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  In order to fund future development expenses, Energy proposes to make capital contributions, loans or open account advances of up to $15 million downstream, directly or indirectly, to Project Venture. All loans or open account advances would bear interest at a rate per annum not in excess of the prime commercial lending rate as in effect from time to time at Mellon Bank plus 4% and would have a final maturity not to exceed 25 years. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Municipal Authority, which is responsible for Project financing, will use the proceeds of the construction financing to reimburse the Joint Venture and the Project Venture for these and all other properly incurred and substantiated development expenses during Phase I. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Finally, the Applicants seek authorization for CSW, Energy or the Joint Venture to obtain a long-term irrevocable standby letter of credit in the amount of $2.9 million (``LOC'') to replace a letter of credit in the same amount currently issued for the benefit of the Municipal Authority. The LOC ensures that the Project Venture will perform its obligations under the Development Agreement. The Municipal Authority would continue to be the beneficiary of the LOC and CSW would be the account party responsible for reimbursing the issuer for drawings made under the LOC. Fees under the LOC would not exceed 1% per annum and the interest payable on the unreimbursed drawings under the LOC would not exceed the prime rate of the issuer plus 4%. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

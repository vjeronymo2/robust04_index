			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Regions show jobs growth JOBS have continued to be created in financial services outside London in spite of recession, according to research by Leeds University. Regional employment in the industry leapt by more than 40 per cent between 1981 and 1991 to reach more than 250,000. While London was hit by recession, growth continued almost everywhere else. Only in Birmingham and Bradford did it stall. Birmingham - which may have suffered from relative proximity to London  - still emerged from the 1991 census with more than 30,000 financial services jobs, as did Edinburgh and Manchester. Bristol, Leeds and Glasgow recorded more than 25,000 each, but Leeds has been showing the fastest recent growth, 19 per cent between 1989 and 1991, representing 4,000 new jobs, when 11,000 were being lost in the sector nationally. More than 40 per cent of these new Leeds jobs, however, appear to have been part-time ones. Bradford's stalled growth almost certainly reflects a local shift to its neighbour Leeds. Leeds now has six of the 20 largest regionally-based law firms, including three of the top five. Legal services jobs more than doubled between the 1981 and 1991 censuses. There are now more than 3,600 in Leeds and 1,800 in Bradford, where some Leeds firms send back-office work. Armed with the new research, Leeds Financial Services Initiative will be launched today to promote the city as an all-round financial centre. Mr Tony Grant, northern regional partner at Coopers and Lybrand, the accountancy firm, will be chairman. More than 60 companies or professional firms have joined the initiative, which intends to join the Association of European Financial Centres. Edinburgh and Manchester are already represented through equivalent professional bodies. Mainland European members include Barcelona, Bilboa, Lyons, Stuttgart and Turin.</p>

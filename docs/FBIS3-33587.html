			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] MIR [Movement of the Revolutionary Left] Deputy  Sergio Medinacelli, CONDEPA [Conscience of the Fatherland]  Deputy Eduardo Paz, and ADN [Nationalist Democratic Action]  Senator Jorge Landivar believe the new U.S. antidrug strategy,  escalating the drug enforcement in the producing countries, will  entail social problems. Therefore, their initial reaction was to  reject transferring the "dirty war" to Bolivia.    In this regard, the three opposition congressmen lashed out  at the fact that Bill Clinton's administration has decided to  give more attention to its "domestic policy," leaving the  producing countries at the mercy of clashes between drug  traffickers and antidrug forces that, more often than not, kill  peasants and not the criminals deeply involved in drug  trafficking activities.    Landivar exclaimed: "We will not allow our country to become  another Colombia." Paz pointed out: "A bloodbath involving  innocent people will be the result of an antidrug war."  Medinacelli stressed: "We cannot pay for Clinton's pragmatism."  <H5>  Like the Industrial Field </H5>   Medinacelli compared the U.S. decision with a situation that  arose a few years ago in the industrial field when the United  States purchased mineral complexes from Bolivia and paid for tin  alone. Nevertheless, when the United States realized that  refining tin damaged the U.S. environment, it preferred the  refining to be carried out in our country.    The MIR congressman added: "The same happens with drug  trafficking. First, the United States waged a cruel war against  drug trafficking in which even politicians were involved, and  now it wants this dirty war to be waged outside U.S. territory."  <H5>  The Armed Forces Will Not Join the War </H5>   After pointing out that the U.S. contribution always  involved  interdiction, with its consequences of violence and death, Paz  ruled out the possibility that the Armed Forces might join the  struggle against drug trafficking because in the past few years  the Special Antinarcotics Force (FELCN) has managed to  accumulate more "firepower" than the Bolivian Army.    The CONDEPA deputy noted: "The U.S. decision will promote an  antinational discussion on the viability of alternative  development in our country."  <H5>  He Is Not Acquainted With Latin America </H5>   For his part, Landivar said Clinton's decision seems to be a  result of his unawareness of the positive results yielded by  alternative development in the Latin American countries.    In Bolivia, Landivar said, the Repentance Decree was the  outcome of the social isolation to which the drug traffickers  have been exposed through well-developed consciousness-raising  campaigns.</p>

Well-Developed Market System Is Basis of a  Normal Socialist Market Economy    To set up a socialist market economic system, we must  nurture  and develop a market system. A well-developed, perfect market  system is the basis of a normal socialist market economy.  Without a well-developed, perfect market system, we cannot begin  to talk about converting to the market economy, nor can we  successfully develop a socialist market economy. The essence of  the restructuring of China's economic system lies in developing  the commodity economy and market relationships and expanding the  role of the market mechanisms, so that the factors of production  can change according to the law of value and the supply and  demand conditions and find their own way into the more efficient  industries and enterprises, and in turn the in-demand trades and  industries and advanced enterprises can undergo rapid  development, while the unwanted trades and industries and  backward enterprises are squeezed out and even eliminated, so  that society as a whole can achieve optimal allocation of  resources.    A market system that meets the needs of the development of  the socialist market economy must necessarily be a unified,  open, competitive, and orderly market system and a system that  is fairly well structured.    To be unified, we need uniform market rules and regulations  as well as policies. We must smash all types of artificial  blockades, overcome market obstacles, and create a nationwide  great circulation, great market pattern.    To be open, we must open up internally--open up the  provinces  and municipalities and the localities, and we must open up  externally--open up to the outside world and link the domestic  markets with the international markets.    To be competitive, we must have an environment to  accommodate  complete and fair competition. We must oppose monopoly,  especially administrative monopoly, and oppose racketeering; but  at the same time, we must avoid cutthroat competition.    To be orderly, all market activities must be put on a  standardized, legalized track so that all transactions are open  and all deals are fair and there are laws to abide by and rules  to follow, creating an orderly market.    To nurture and develop the market system, we must set up a  proper and complete market structure and develop other types of  markets at the same time. Market construction must meet the  objective needs of the economy so that "the development of every  market enlivens a sector of the economy and enriches some of the  people." We must avoid the situation where after we make a great  effort to set up a market, there is no market participation and  few market transactions. We must rectify the chaotic situation  in the market where: "You build a market, then I build one too;  since you control a market, I want one too; because you give  your permission, I will too; your market is big, but mine is  even bigger." We should develop not only commodities markets but  also capital goods markets. We must not only help the domestic  market flourish but also develop international markets. We must  not only develop spot markets but also gradually set up futures  markets (We should set up commodities futures market before we  set up financial futures markets.) We should develop not only  markets for tangibles but also markets for intangibles, and we  should set up tender and auction markets. From another  perspective, developing the market system involves two areas:  One is to set up the hardware system which includes market  facilities, warehouse facilities, and railroads and highways.  The other is the software system which includes management,  information, telecommunications, and laws and regulations. When  the government nurtures and develops the market, it should pay  attention not only to the hardware system, but more importantly,  it should develop the software system and establish a proper  framework.  <H3>  II. Price Reform Is the Key to the Formation of the Market  System </H3>   At the heart of the market mechanism is the pricing  mechanism. Price reform is the key to market development and the  creation of the market system. The market's role in allocating  resources is mainly guided by and achieved through the market  prices and their changes. To set up a socialist market economic  system, we must deepen price reform, set up a market price  system that is regulated and controlled at the macro level, and  give full play to the role of the market mechanisms.    After 15 years of price reform, China has made substantive  progress in this area. Ninety percent of the consumer goods have  been decontrolled and are now regulated by the market. The  double track pricing of capital goods is fast merging into a  single track, and most of them have adopted the market's single  track price. After rectification and decontrol, the price of  services has become more reasonable; the process of marketizing  the price of factors of production has also begun. Meanwhile, a  new price regulation and control system is gradually being set  up: For example, the comprehensive use of fiscal and monetary  measures to control the overall price level has produced some  results, and we have accumulated some useful experience; we have  set up a reserve system for important goods and materials which  can be used to suppress market prices; more than a dozen  provinces and more than 60 cities have set up price regulation  funds for key products; and we also have promulgated laws and  regulations to regulate pricing behavior.    Price reform has clearly improved the once seriously  distorted pricing structure. The long-depressed relative prices  of agricultural products and basic industrial products have been  raised: Comparing 1992 to 1978, agricultural product procurement  price has increased 176.5 percent; the retail price of rural  industrial products has increased 83.2 percent; prices of  excavated products have increased 165.7 percent; raw industrial  materials, 150.2 percent; processed industrial products, 114.8  percent. More than 95 percent of the imported commodities are  using the agent system, and domestic market prices have linked  up with international market prices.    Even now, price reform is not yet complete. The saying that  price reform has successfully climbed ten-thousand mountains is  not exactly true. Although market mechanisms and pricing  mechanisms now play an important role in regulating production  and demand, price reform is still an arduous task. There are  still no market prices for factors of production, and therefore  the market's basic role in allocating resources is constrained.  Some important factors of production are still under the  double-track pricing system; the task of merging tracks has not  yet been accomplished. The domestic market prices of some  products still deviate significantly from international prices,  and as a result, we cannot use comparative cost as a basis to  regulate their import and export to improve foreign trade  efficiency. The price regulation and control system is unsound,  and we have few material means to keep the market in line, so  that when the market price of some products begins to fluctuate,  we cannot effective apply macro regulation and control measures  and reduce the magnitude of price fluctuation by means of  expanding or contracting product circulation, regulating import  and export, or making use of the market regulation fund and so  on.    To promote market development and give full play to the role  of the market mechanisms and further develop the market system,  we must accomplish the following price reform tasks:    Within the next 3 years, we should decontrol the prices of  goods and services that are competitive. This also means closing  the double-track pricing system for factors of production (the  competitive portion) by shifting to the market price track.    Within the next 3 to 5 years, we should sort out and  readjust  the government-set prices of goods and services. The focus is on  raising the prices of basic products and services.    In the near-term, we should merge the yuan's double-track  prices and implement a variable exchange rate system.    Domestic and foreign market prices should be pegged. Prices  of commercial goods should link tracks first.    We should accelerate the process of marketization of  capital,  land, and other key factors of production.    We should further establish and perfect the price regulation  and control system that focuses on keeping the product price  level relatively stable (with annual increases not exceeding 10  percent) and the prices of important commodities relatively  steady.    We should promulgate and perfect laws and regulations that  guarantee the normal functioning of the market price system and  set up a perfect and open market information network.  <H3>  III. Focus on the Development of Markets for Key Factors of  Production </H3>   Henceforth, when we further develop and perfect markets for  goods, we must also focus on the development of markets for  factors of production.    At the end of 1992, nationwide, we had more than 1,000  wholesale capital goods markets, more than 1,000 wholesale  markets for industrial consumption goods, more than 1,600  wholesale markets for agricultural and sideline products, and  nearly 80,000 township country fair markets, and some important  commodities exchange markets experimenting with futures exchange  have also begun to emerge. In the future, as needed by the  development of market economy, we should set up some  standardized, nationwide wholesale markets and exchanges for  industrial and agricultural products in localities where  important commodities are produced, sold, or collected and  distributed, and on that basis, we can choose a handful of  products to test the commodities futures market. In the  near-term, we can concentrate efforts on setting up proper  futures markets for grain, cotton, oil, nonferrous metals, and  crude oil, and we should have strict regulations and gradually  link these markets with the international market network. We  should reform the existing commercial and commodity circulation  systems and gradually create a wholesale system and a retail  system that integrate large, medium, and small enterprises; and  that combine and mix different economic formats as well as  different operating styles. A perfect commodity economy should  be a large, open system where all kinds of commodities can  circulate freely across industrial sectors, regions, and  national boundaries. This system should be able to link the  domestic and foreign markets and provide strong incentives as  well as pressure to improve the quality of the nation's economic  activities and promote the development of the socialist market  economy.    If the market mechanisms are to play a basic role in  allocating resources, the factors of production must be able to  circulate in the market. In the near-term, we must put the  emphasis of market construction on nurturing and developing the  fledgling capital goods markets.    Capital is the most precious, the most scarce resource in a  market economy. The capital market is the hub of the whole  market economy. The key to realizing the optimal allocation of  resources lies in developing a perfect capital market and  increasing the use-efficiency of capital. In a capital market,  there are two ways to raise capital--directly and indirectly. In  the near to intermediate-term, China will still rely on the  indirect method of raising capital, but at the same time, we  will actively develop various ways to raise capital directly. As  for the proportion of funds raised directly and indirectly, it  cannot be determined artificially; it can only be determined  amid competition. Today, the development of the capital market  is plagued by lack of discipline and disorder which have given  rise to all kinds of reckless fund gathering and distribution  activities. To develop the capital market, we must gradually let  the market set the interest rates and promptly end the  double-track and multiple-track systems. The central bank must  be able to regulate market rates by taking control of the basic  interest rates. China already has a fledgling money market.  Henceforth, using existing regional short-term inter-bank loan  markets as base, we should smash regional blockades, standardize  market management, and form a nationwide unified money market.  We should develop bill discounting and mortgage business,  further develop the short-term government bond market, and allow  the central bank to engage in open market operations to buy and  sell government bonds.    Land is a scarce and non-renewable resource. We must  treasure  it and put it to proper use. We must take a step further to  implement a compensated, limited-term land-use system and  develop the land market to give play to the market mechanisms'  role in optimizing the allocation of land resource. In the urban  market system, the state should monopolize the primary market,  but the secondary market should be decontrolled. Today, whether  in the primary or the secondary market, we still do not have the  mechanism that lets the market set the price of land-use rights.  Henceforth, the sale and transfer of commercial land-use rights  should be conducted through public tender or auction to make the  process more competitive and transparent. In the long-run, we  should concentrate on setting up a "posted-price" system to  guide and standardize land prices, and it can also be used as a  basis for levying land tax. By levying a real estate business  tax, income tax, and value-added tax, the state need not lose  its share of profit generated by land when land-use rights are  being transferred or traded. We must crack down on illegal  speculation of land, reckless jacking up of land prices, and  other activities to exact exorbitant profit, and we must not  funnel too much money into the land market. In turning over  agricultural land to non-agricultural use, we must comply with  the land-use plan and proceed with restraint.    We should gradually set up a labor market. First we must  acknowledge the market mechanisms' basic role in the proper  allocation of resources. To this end, we must change the wage  system. The state should no longer serve as employer or assigner  of jobs. Wages should be determined by labor productivity rate  and supply and demand in the labor market. Payment for labor  should be in monetary terms. We should permit and even guide the  proper circulation of the labor force and smash the labor  market's regional boundaries in a planned and systematic way to  gradually eliminate the iron rice bowl, the iron-clad wage  system, and the iron chair--guaranteed employment.    We must further develop the technologies and information  markets. Developing the technologies market is of great  importance to the commercialization and industrialization of  advanced and new technologies, to the promotion of scientific  and technological advancement, and to the orientation of  scientific and technological work toward the main battleground  of economic construction. We must promulgate a perfect set of  laws and regulations to protect intellectual property rights and  protect the transfer of the fruits of science and technology.  Developing the information market is an inherent requirement in  the establishment of a well-developed, mature market system.  Henceforth, the technologies, information, and consultation  service industries must operate like enterprises. Their services  should be society-based, and their products and services should  be commercialized, and we should bring in the competitive  mechanisms.    We should also vigorously develop a market for property  rights and a housing market and so on. We must control the cost  and price of houses, so that most urban residents can get into  the housing market.  <H5>  IV. Vigorously Develop Market Intermediaries </H5>   The vigorous development of market intermediaries is an  important link in the normal functioning and the healthy  development of the socialist market economy.    The better developed the modern market economy, the broader  the economic entities' market ties, and the busier and more  specialized and technical the market exchange activities, the  more we need to have qualified market entities, different types  of developed markets, and stringent market rules and regulation;  on top of that, we must also set up and develop market  intermediaries to serve those taking part in the market  activities and to promote the orderly conduct of market  activities.    Currently, the kinds of market intermediaries we need to  develop include the following: Self-disciplinary institutions,  such as various types of trade federations and trade  associations, that coordinate and constrain the behavior of  personnel in enterprises and trades and industries who  participate in market activities; brokerages, mortgage  companies, and auction houses that directly engage in market  transaction services; accounting firms, auditing firms, law  firms, appraisers--especially land appraisers--who are there to  guarantee equitable market transactions and fair competition;  institutions that provide research, consultation, and  information services to promote market development;  price-quotation systems, settlement centers, materials  allocation and delivery centers, and warehouses; arbitration  organs to settle market disputes; quantity measurement, quality  control, product inspection, and other production service  agencies to supervise market activities; a whole spectrum of  circulation intermediaries, such as rural circulation  associations, that help develop rural markets and help the  scattered peasants get into the market; employment agencies and  personnel exchange centers that promote the circulation of  well-trained and untrained workers.    Market intermediaries generally should be created from the  bottom up, by enterprises themselves, on a voluntary basis.  Their main functions are to provide their member enterprises  with information, advice, and legal and business services; train  specialized personnel; open up international communications  channels; represent the member enterprises' and individuals'  interests in settling business disputes. They draw up guild  regulations and trade pacts according to market regulations,  impose collective self-discipline, supervise market  transactions, fight unfair competition, and guarantee normal  production and marketing order, and these include conscious  compliance with the state's quality standards, refusal to engage  in improper competition, and refusal to enter into collusion to  set monopolistic prices and divide up the market. They smooth  the relationship between enterprises and government, so that the  trade federations and trade associations become self-coordinated.</p>

			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CELEBRITY ADVOCATES FOR POLITICAL CAUSES  </P> <P> Funny that Rosenberg should bring up Tyne Daly's name. It was Daly's political  "dis-advocacy" in the last gubernatorial election that gave celebrity advocates  in general little or no credibility.  </P> <P> Daly was so offensive as well as so off base in her attacks on Gov. George  Deukmejian that I no longer could stand to watch her on the fine "Cagney &amp;  Lacey" series.  </P> <P> The ad that I found most distasteful was the one done by Tracy Nelson and the  little cancer victim. I know Tracy has licked cancer and I am glad for her, but  I thought that to use the little girl and her sad plight to persuade people to  vote for Prop. 128 was shameful.  </P> <P> DORIAN B.

			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LIMITING SALES OF SPRAY PAINT TO CURB GRAFFITI  </P> <P> I have followed with interest the letters and editorials on graffiti. In fact,  The Times did a story on me and my graffiti-plagued wall.  </P> <P> No mention seems ever to be made of the solution.  </P> <P> There is a San Fernando Valley company called Graffiti Prevention Systems.  Phone: (800) 247-3395. This company completely solved the problem.  </P> <P> I hired a painter to paint out all graffiti while their serviceman stood by.  The moment the paint dried the serviceman sprayed on a coat of thin invisible  wax.  </P> <P> The next morning the wall had been vandalized again. But later in the day  Graffiti Prevention arrived, steamed off the wax and the wall was pristine  again.  </P> <P> The first week they had to make several trips. After that word was apparently  out that vandalism didn't last long on those particular walls.  </P> <P> I paid Graffiti Prevention a monthly fee to be ready to melt off any further  assaults. I think I needed to call them only once during the next several  years, before the property was sold.  </P> <P> I do not understand why no mention is ever made of the foolproof solution to  the problem.  </P> <P> THOMAS L. DAWSON  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

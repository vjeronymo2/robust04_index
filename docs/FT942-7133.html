			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Survey of International Capital Markets (10): Cash haven lures investors - Commercial paper, the ECP market is thriving The volatility which has plagued the government bond markets across the world since the US Federal Reserve started raising interest rates in February has increased the attraction of the Euro commercial paper (ECP) market. The prospect of higher interest rates in the US, and uncertainty over the long-term direction of UK rates, has prompted fixed-income investors to shift the balance of their portfolios away from long-dated instruments to the very short end of the yield curve, analysts say. The short maturities available in the ECP market, from one day to 364 days, appeal in particular to investors who are looking for a safe haven to deposit their cash until the conditions in the bond and equity markets improve. This defensive investment strategy is expected to keep outstandings in the ECP market at their present high levels for most of this year. 'The ECP market is looking healthy and there is strong demand from investors for good-quality paper,' says Ms Julie Joe, CP product manager at Lehman Brothers. According to Lehman Brothers, the total combined ECP and Euronote market outstandings increased Dollars 2bn during the first quarter of 1994 from Dollars 110bn in the last quarter of 1993 to Dollars 112bn, of which the total ECP outstandings account for Dollars 81bn. In the same period, the USCP outstandings increased by the same proportion from Dollars 560bn to Dollars 570bn. Although the ECP market is much smaller than the USCP market, its competitive rates are attracting a growing number of US issuers. Mr David Knight, managing director of CP operations at BZW, says that rates in the two markets have been coming closer together and that in recent months ECP rates have consistently been five basis points cheaper than in the USCP market. He adds that the ECP market also offers US issuers a tax-efficient way of funding their European operations. Another factor which is increasing the attraction of the ECP market is renewed confidence in its ability to provide quick access to short-term liquidity. Question marks over its liquidity and efficiency were eliminated last June when Denmark raised as much as Dollars 1.5bn in a matter of days to support the Danish krone when it came under attack from foreign exchange speculators. Since then, the size of ECP programmes has increased steadily. Ford Credit Europe, Hanson and Guinness have been able to raise funds of more than Dollars 1bn, amounts which have previously been the sole domain of sovereign borrowers. Other high-profile ECP programmes include Dollars 1bn for Bankers Trust New Zealand and Dollars 500m for PowerGen, the UK's second largest electricity generation company. 'Now corporates are able to access the market in excess of Dollars 1bn,' says Mr Knight. He adds that this development will facilitate any needs in the corporate sector to fund short-term working capital requirements, especially now that inhospitable conditions in the primary markets discourage the launch of bond issues. Six or seven large programmes are expected to emerge over the next few months from a variety of European and US borrowers, including corporates, banks and quasi-sovereign entities, analysts say. The inroads which the ECP market has made into the German and Swiss domestic markets as a result of deregulation in the two countries have also contributed to the increased volume. Issuers can now issue in D-Marks and Swiss francs directly under their ECP programmes. There are also signs that European issuers are looking to raise funds in the US. In April, the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme, the second largest pension scheme in the UK, became the first one outside the US to obtain credit ratings from Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's, the two leading international ratings agencies, in order to access the USCP market. Mr Brian Matthews, finance director of ESN Pension Management Group, said that one of the main benefits of the rating was that the scheme's US investment property company, Eastern Realty Investment Corporation, was able to raise Dollars 105m in the USCP market at an average interest rate of less than 3.5 per cent. This financing route provided two advantages to the scheme, he said. First, it was tax-efficient because the scheme did not have tax-exempt status in the US. Second, if the scheme had lent the funds to the US subsidiary, it would have had to give up a return which was much higher than the interest rate which the US company was paying. Despite the higher profile the ECP market enjoys, several factors could hinder progress. The need to have a high-quality rating is the main obstacle facing potential issuers. At present investors tend to be conservative and restrict themselves to the best-rated paper. As a result of this black-and-white attitude to credit ratings, many issuers with mediocre ratings have difficulty raising significant sums in the ECP market. By contrast, they have good access to the US domestic market. Mr Knight points to another negative development - the largest ECP investor segment, the French Sicav money market funds, have been reducing their holdings of ECP to comply with regulations laid down by the Commission des Operations de Bourse, the French stock market authorities, that Sicavs can hold only a maximum of 10 per cent of assets in unregulated instruments such as ECP.</p>

			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / P&amp;G details biggest job cut plan PROCTER &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products giant, yesterday announced plans to cut its workforce by 12 per cent and its manufacturing plants by 20 per cent over the next three or four years to improve efficiency and combat intensifying global competition. The move will mean a Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1bn) charge against 1992-1993 earnings. It is the biggest single job reduction announcement in P&amp;G's recent history though it has closed, or partly closed, 17 plants in the past five years. The company will eliminate around 13,000 of its 106,000 jobs worldwide, with about half the cuts coming from plant closures and the rest from a drive to reduce overhead expenses. Some 30 of P&amp;G's 147 plants will be shut, with the total split evenly between the US and the rest of the world. Mr Edwin Artzt, chairman, said P&amp;G aimed to take as many of the job losses as possible through the reassignment of workers, early retirement and other voluntary measures. The cuts come against a background of intensifying competition in the world consumer products industry, where P&amp;G is battling for market share against multinationals such as Anglo-Dutch Unilever and retailers' own-label products. This has forced manufacturers of branded products, such as P&amp;G, to cut prices and rethink marketing strategies. Mr Artzt expected to generate Dollars 500m in after-tax savings from the cuts by 1995-1996. The aim was to improve profits growth, either by achieving better margins or by cutting prices further, and thus building volume and market share. He insisted the restructuring was not a sign of trouble at P&amp;G. 'We have a healthy, growing business, a strong balance sheet, positive cashflow, state-of-the-art products and a well stocked technology pipeline. However, we must slim down to stay competitive.' He said P&amp;G had a good fourth quarter and expected to report double-digit earnings growth for 1992-1993, excluding special reserves and accounting changes. Some Dollars 1.2bn of the restructuring charge is for manufacturing consolidation, with the rest for cost cutting measures. The company is also taking a Dollars 925m charge to adopt two new accounting standards.</p>

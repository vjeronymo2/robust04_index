			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Col Anatoliy Belousov: "Junior Officers Need the </F> Help of Their Elders More Than Ever. Will They Get It?"]    [Text] How wonderful a lieutenant's years are! How can any  of us, servicemen who have already lived and seen a few things,  possibly not recollect an officer's youth with trepidation!    I remember three of us, lieutenants still wet behind the  ears, arriving at our assigned unit. The surprises started  almost right away. The equipment of the unit turned out to be  more recent than what we had in the school. That meant doing  some retraining. And there was a platoon-full of subordinates,  every other one of whom was far from an expert. How were we to  work with them? And even we weren't much of a gift to the  company commander--there was always something about us that  displeased him.    Nevertheless, life went on. In the evening, upon returning  from our work area, we would wash off the dust and grease, fry  some potatoes, and then spruce up and head for the Officers Club  for some dancing and some socializing with tenth-year coeds.    But what is most memorable to me from those times is the  people under whose direction I served, and the people with whom  I was fortunate to serve. Of course we had different commanders,  but I remember that first company commander we had, who seemed  at first to be such an overly stiff, has-been soldier: How much  unpleasantness he shielded us from, how many lessons he taught  us about life! There were many of this sort who were truly  concerned for us.    These of course aren't just idle recollections. Today the  situation in the reforming Russian Army is such that we have to  ask ourselves this question: Will today's young officers have  such memories of father-figure commanders? Will they remain in  the army, or will they leave for greener pastures?    The problem of young personnel has become extremely painful  to the army and navy. In 1990-1993 (as of the beginning of this  year) more than 95,000 young officers, up to 30 years old, left  the army ranks. This was in a time when there is no one in the  troops to appoint to primary officer positions. If you look at  each of the armed services separately, you will find that the  situation is most favorable in the Strategic Missile Forces. At  least in recent times a tendency for young officers not to want  to revert to civilian life can be clearly discerned. In the  ground forces, 6,623 young officers left in 1993. Of 3,214 who  left the Air Defense Forces, 1,206 did so because they wanted  to, while the rest left because of incompatibility with service  and for discrediting the honor of the military. In the navy, in  the words of Rear Admiral Vasiliy Viktorov, chief of the navy's  Personnel Training and Placement Directorate, the number of  vacant primary positions now reaches into the thousands. Even  with regard for this year's military school graduates, the  personnel hunger in the lowest ship units will be less than 50  percent satisfied. The picture is similar in the air force as  well.    The reasons why young people leave are generally well known.  Some long for the motherland--for what are now sovereign states,  while others part with the army because of problems in  establishing homes for their families, and still others are  simply unable to feed their families. This is on the backdrop of  a general decline in the prestige of military service. But I  think it would be wrong to reduce everything just to this.    There can of course be no debate that a young person  possessing the diploma of a military engineer and radio  technician, a programmer, or a motor mechanic could set himself  up reasonably well in civilian life. But let's think about the  particular reasons why junior officers leave. Let's consider the  two main ones--because they want to, and because of  incompatibility with service. As it turns out, in most cases  lieutenants and captains don't leave on their own, but are  forced out. This is even considering the fact that some junior  officers (who were unable to get an honorable discharge) were  forced to commit violations, and thus they fell into the  category of officers leaving due to "incompatibility with  service."    What is behind this? Are they really professionally  unsuited,  or is there something else here, and namely, were they unable to  find a person at the beginning of their career who could have  supported them, taught them, and reinforced their faith in their  own strengths? Can it really be true that there are no longer  mentors of this sort in the army or, if you wish, the sort of  educators that we associated with when we were lieutenants?    Of course there are. But our democratic society has become  calloused and indifferent to the fate of others, and this bitter  cup has not passed by the army either. Tell me, is it really  normal for a school graduate arriving in his unit to begin his  military career by serving as a sentry or unloading coal for a  boiler plant? But even this could be understood. Because a  battalion commander has only three soldiers to help him, and the  post can't go without heat. A lieutenant, I believe, would  understand this. If only they would talk with him in a civilized  manner, speak kindly, explain the situation, and perhaps even  ask him to participate. But no! His superiors wouldn't stoop to  such pampering: That's an order, so do it!    In former times, and not really that long ago, a commander  had to work directly with people. And he did. Now, with the  advent of deputy commanders for educational work, many  commanders took all of this all too literally: Our business is  to lead, to command, and yours is to educate. So educate! In the  meantime these deputies are often themselves unsure of what  their new station means, and consequently junior officers find  themselves left to their own devices. It is well known what can  happen when junior officers fail to sense any real concern on  the part of their superiors. And such a commander easily writes  off the loss of a junior officer due to objective factors--our  times are hard, the impoverished existence of  lieutenants--that's why they don't want to serve.    The reason things aren't bad in the Strategic Missile Forces  as an example is that real concern is shown here for junior  officers. For each and every one of them. And they represent  more than 40 percent of all officers in the forces. It is  precisely upon them that the main burden of alert duty lies,  especially where the work is the hardest--in the regiments.    "Young people are the future of the missile forces," feels  Colonel-General Igor Sergeyev, commander-in-chief of the  Strategic Missile Forces. "We have developed and are  implementing a program of social protection for junior officers  and their families. And so, despite the great financial  difficulties, all junior officers receive the 12 months' pay  they are supposed to get after graduating from school in order  to arrange their personal lives. Even before they arrive in the  unit, commanders hunt up apartments for them, reserve places for  their children in preschool institutions, and find jobs for  their wives. Junior Officers' Day has become traditional in the  forces. Commanders regularly visit their families, and delve  into their needs."    There isn't any need to invent anything new in the  approaches  to work with junior officers--the arsenal of these methods is  sufficiently rich and diverse. The work itself creates the best  impact upon the mood of people, if of course it is well  organized--that is, if the officer is doing what he is supposed  to be doing primarily--combat training. Many commanders in the  forces and in the navy understand this well, and despite today's  shortage of everything imaginable, they provide subordinates the  possibility to exercise their lawful rights--the right to serve  in their specialty, rather than being used as gofers and errand  boys. A junior officer living in such an environment begins to  develop work satisfaction, and pride in having the honor to  belong to a glorious cohort of tankmen, or seamen, or  paratroopers.    I'm not of course trying to say that a guardian "uncle"  needs  to be assigned to every school graduate, like they used to do  with new recruits way back when. What I'm talking about is  concrete assistance to junior officers on the part of their  elders, which has always been a tradition in the Russian officer  corps. Whether or not they will get it depends on us.</p>

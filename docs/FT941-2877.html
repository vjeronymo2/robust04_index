			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Imry buys Pounds 118m property portfolio Imry Holdings, the property company taken over by Barclays, the clearing bank, in December 1992, has acquired a Pounds 117.9m property portfolio from Timberlaine, a subsidiary of General Accident. The portfolio consists of 1.7m sq ft of space in the south-east of England, mainly in Hampshire and Surrey. Imry said the deal gave it a portfolio of 'scope and quality', which complemented its existing investment and trading portfolio. The deal was financed by debt provided by GE Capital and equity from its own resources. General Accident said the deal gave it the opportunity to rationalise its overall property holdings and concentrate on new investment areas. About 28 per cent of the portfolio is unlet, mostly in new buildings. About Pounds 5.9m of the purchase price relates to development sites, particularly in Southampton and Bristol. The portfolio consists of 42 per cent offices, 32 per cent industrial and warehouses and 24 per cent retail. Barclay's involvement in Imry began in 1989 when it financed a highly-leveraged takeover of the company. Imry has said that it expects to be floated or reversed into a quoted company.</p>

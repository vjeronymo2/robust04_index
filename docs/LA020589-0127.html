			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'LETTER' TO EX-PRESIDENT PRAISED FOR ITS HONESTY  </P> <P> I take my hat off to you for telling the truth about what happened in the last  eight years with Reagan in the White House. Telling and writing about the  sordid mess this country and the world is in will not undo the damage. We'll  all have to pay the hard way for his sleeping and Nancy calling the signals.  </P> <P> BILL HAMMER  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

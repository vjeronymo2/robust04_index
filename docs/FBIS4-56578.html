			<p>BFN     [Text] Chamber of Deputies President Frantz Robert Monde is  dismayed by the numerous steps taken by several U.S. sectors to  find a solution to the Haitian crisis. In a letter to U.S.  President Bill Clinton, Bob Monde conveyed his disappointment  with the Democratic congressmen's attitude of the Black Caucus,  who want to impose -- even through genocide and force of arms --  a so-called solution to the Haitian crisis.    In his letter to President Clinton, the president of the  Chamber of Deputies points out President Aristide's obvious  tendency toward provoking an upheaval within the command staff  of the Haitian Armed Forces by soliciting on the very day of his  installation [7 February 1991] the dismissal of the entire  military command of that time and by demanding five months later  the resignation -- under pressure -- of the commander in chief  of the Army, General Herard Abraham who was replaced by Gen.  Raoul Cedras. Cedras was appointed provisionally, something  that the Constitution does not provide for, Monde points out.    While looking for a solution that can put an end to the  distress of the Haitian people before the accelerated  deterioration of their living conditions, the office of the  Chamber of Deputies initiated a series of consultations with the  various sectors in order to fill the institutional vacuum  created by the departure of Robert Malval, Bob Monde further  states. It is no longer time for war, writes Bob Monde, but for  peace, the noble objective for which the United Nations was  created.    In conclusion Robert Monde says: I appeal to the wisdom and  the clear-sightedness of the head of state of the most powerful  country of the world so he does not let himself be influenced by  those men who -- all things considered -- are exploiting the  Haitian crisis, the anguish, and the misery of the Haitian  people to seek and defend their own interests. Thus concludes  the letter Chamber President Frantz Robert Monde sent to U.S.  President William Jefferson Clinton.</p>

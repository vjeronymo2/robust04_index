			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / International Company News: PaineWebber boosted by strong retail demand PAINEWEBBER, one of Wall Street's biggest securities houses, yesterday reported a near-threefold rise in first-quarter profits to Dollars 31.6m, aided by strong demand for its retail broking services. The independent company's first-quarter income of Dollars 1.09 a share was 193 per cent higher than the 20 cents a share (Dollars 10.8m) made in the opening three months of 1990. The figures were well received by the market yesterday, and the company' stock risen Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 24 3/8 . PaineWebber, capitalised at Dollars 1.55bn, is the third big Wall Street house, after J. P. Morgan and Smith Barney, to announce a robust improvement in first-quarter profits. Since the beginning of the year the significant increase in bond and stock trading volume, and the boom in equity values has boosted securities industry revenues, in the process helping Wall Street recover from 1990, its worst year on record. PaineWebber said that all of its main business groups prospered in the first quarter, when net revenues were Dollars 474.8m, up 11 per cent on the Dollars 426m at the same stage in 1990. Retail broking and asset management were particularly strong, helped by the return to the stock market of many of the individual investors scared away in 1987 by the October market crash. In the quarter retail broking revenues rose by 15.4 per cent, while retail customer assets increased to a record Dollars 80.2bn, up from Dollars 67.1bn a year earlier. The company's institutional fixed income and core equity businesses also performed well in the healthy environment for bond and stock prices. Investment banking revenues, however, fell to Dollars 47m, down from the Dollars 67m earned in the first quarter of 1990. PaineWebber's recent experiences in investment banking have not been successful - last year it was forced to take a Dollars 71m increase in reserves for merchant banking activities to cover losses on junk bond-related investments - and the firm is concentrating on retail stock broking. Total expenses at PaineWebber rose from Dollars 408.9m in the first quarter of 1990 to Dollars 426m.</p>

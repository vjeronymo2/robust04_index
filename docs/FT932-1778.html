			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / International Company News: S&amp;P downgrades Handelsbanken SVENSKA Handelsbanken yesterday suffered a cut in its credit rating by Standard &amp; Poor's despite being the only Swedish bank to have weathered the country's severe banking crisis without so far having to apply for state support, writes Hugh Carnegy. S&amp;P said it was downgrading Handelsbanken's Dollars 4bn of long-term debt from A+ to A and its subordinated debt from A to A- because of 'persistent recession in Sweden and its impact on the strength of its balance sheet'. S&amp;P also announced it was taking its ratings on Postipankki, a state-owned Finnish bank, off its creditwatch list where they were placed in February. But Postipankki's Dollars 3.6bn of long term debt was nevertheless downgraded from A to BBB+.</p>

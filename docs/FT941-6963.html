			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / How to Spend It: Such a handy winter warmer - The gloves are off as Lucia van der Post beats the cold snap Just back from Kenya and Tanzania (yes, thank you, I had a smashing time and I hate to tell you but it was hot, hot, hot) to find England reeling from the cold. Time to try out a pair of Tollybands. Some of you may remember that, long ago when the world was young, people in rural areas used to wear sheepskin wristbands to keep their hands warm. Primarily designed for those who needed to keep their hands free in cold weather - tennis players, outdoor stall-holders, gardeners - those who felt really cold could wear them as well as gloves. Tollybands are a revival of the old idea and I have to report that they work. The reason why is that they keep the blood flowing into the hands warm. Even in this week's freezing weather they kept my hands warm without gloves. Tollybands come in a range of colours - the chicest being bottle green which would blend wonderfully with all those ubiquitous waxed cotton jackets. Those addicted to other colours will find something to match. They cost Pounds 14.99 a pair (including p &amp; p) from Tollybands, Old Wool House, PO Box 70, London SW3 5XU.</p>

			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Stein steps down It is difficult not to feel a twinge of sympathy for Mr Cyril Stein after Ladbroke's shares rose 7 per cent on news he is not even to be a non-executive director any more. After all, Mr Stein has spent the best part of 40 years at the helm. The market's ingratitude has a certain logic just the same. It was always difficult to imagine Mr Stein taking a back seat at board meetings. His departure will strengthen Ladbroke's resolve to get out of property and, presumably, to cut the dividend to a sustainable level. Above all it signals that the new management, which promises to be more open, is very much in charge. A flow of other announcements - the appointment of a couple of strong non-executive directors, for example, and some new faces to reinforce the management of the betting and hotels divisions - should help maintain the share price recovery. The new team still faces some difficult calls, however, not least over the speed with which it sells out of property when prices are rising and disposals could prove dilutive. Assuming no skeletons fall out of the cupboard when the door is opened, the task should not require further significant write-downs. Though some adjustment to hotel values may be needed, gearing should not be a particular problem. The dividend must still be cut simply to restore cover rather than in a bid to conserve cash. Texas Homecare will remain difficult for some time. But Ladbroke's other two legs will be a strongly-branded hotel operation balanced by a cash-rich betting business which may offer opportunities for international expansion. That is not necessarily a recipe for spectacular growth once cyclical recovery is out of the way, but Ladbroke's attraction would increase relative to Forte, which has had to sell some cash-generative businesses to repair its balance sheet.</p>

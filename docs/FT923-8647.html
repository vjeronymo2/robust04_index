			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Arts: Excellence on the small stage - Theatre TWO PLAYS in London this month are worth seeing as an illustration of how technically excellent the small stage has become. They are Seven Doors by the German writer, Botho Strauss, at The Gate, and Porcelain by a Singaporean writer, Chay Yew, at the Royal Court's Theatre Upstairs. On the face of it, the two pieces could not be more different. Seven Doors is very German abstract, with references to Faust, and hops about all over the place, including hell. Porcelain is an investigative documentary about a homosexual murder in a public lavatory in Bethnal Green. Technique brings them together. Both productions use casts where people play more than one part - not particularly for reasons of an economy, but as a deliberate style. In the programme for Porcelain, indeed, only one actor is listed against a specific part. That is Daniel York as John Lee, the young Hong King Chinese student who commits the murder and plays only himself throughout. All four other actors are named simply as voices and take on whatever role is appropriate: police officer, television interviewer and so on. The Gate, as so often, is ambitious about the staging, despite having one of the smallest available spaces in London theatre. David Farr's direction of Seven Doors has a cast of 10. Sometimes they appear all at once without falling over each other. Moreover, this relatively large cast does not preclude an effective and frequently changing set. The seven doors of the title are not always in the same place, yet there is still no impression of overcrowding. There is also some dramatic use of lighting and colour. The same goes for Glen Goei's and Stephen Knight's direction of Porcelain, which is played almost entirely in black and white. One notably harrowing scene is played in the dark with only the voices heard, and is all the better for such restraint. There are other similarities. Botho Strauss and Chay Yew both have a fascination with television. Seven Doors picks up a television quiz show and there are frequent scenes of characters being interviewed. Much of Porcelain develops as though it were a documentary for Channel 4. I do not find this simply derivative; it is the playwrights' acknowledgement that television is a very power influence, whether revealing or distorting. Quite apart from the technical excellence and the high standing of acting, the two pieces have a high level of seriousness. Porcelain is one of the few modern plays that I have seen which does not seek to blame crime on the police. Indeed, the police officer, when interviewed, is studiously neutral and fair. He says that he thought he detected a look of mourning on the face of the presumed killer. It is also hard to say whether Porcelain is more about homosexuality, race or just plain loneliness. This is a compliment. Any play which manages to bring off such a mixture of themes deserves to be praised. In the young Asian it adds a new voice: a clever man who is about to go to Cambridge, but has not adjusted to the society around him. Daniel York's performance is outstanding; so is that of the unnamed Cambridge psychiatrist who talks to him in prison. And whatever you may think of the subject, it is immaculately handled. Seven Doors is about loneliness, too: more particularly, the difference between supposed extraordinary and ordinary people. There is a splendid scene when the inventor of a video machine that records dreams has committed suicide and arrived on the 'other side'. Hell turns out to be exceedingly boring. Among all the excellent playing, I would single out Barry Wallman who plays a Mephistophelean figure called simply The Void. The whole piece is haunting. Between them the two plays tell you a great deal about modern theatre. Seven Doors, The Gate until August 22. (071) 229 0706. Porcelain, Royal Court Theatre Upstairs. (071) 730 1745</p>

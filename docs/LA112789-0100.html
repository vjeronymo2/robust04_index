			<p><P> November 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROOSEVELT '79 REUNION: THEY STAND AND DELIVER;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: EAST LOS ANGELES BARRIO KIDS RETURN 10 YEARS AFTER GRADUATION TO  FIND THEIR CLASSMATES ARE DOCTORS, LAWYERS, TEACHERS AND POLITICAL ACTIVISTS.  </P> <P> The graduates of Roosevelt High School's Class of '79 shared some common bonds.  They were barrio kids -- Latinos, Asians and blacks who grew up on Los Angeles'  East Side, where they grappled with cultural differences, poverty, language  problems and the ever-present threat of feuding gangs.  </P> <P> But they also were an exceptional class that "really had its act together from  the start," says Cynthia Augustine, a former Roosevelt teacher and a class  sponsor who now is assistant principal at Markham Intermediate School in Watts.  "No other class did what they did. . . . They all went out and did something  very, very positive."  </P> <P> Indeed, as 275 Class of '79 alumni learned at their 10th reunion Saturday night  at the Los Angeles Hilton, their bright, ambitious and determined peers, for  the most part, continued or are continuing their education.  </P> <P> More than half of them went on to colleges, universities and trade schools,  most on scholarships and grants.  </P> <P> Now, a decade out of Roosevelt, many of them are more than simply striving  students, struggling with hardships.  </P> <P> They're doctors, like Beemeth Robles, who graduated from Stanford University's  medical school and now is a general surgery resident at Stanford Medical  Center.  </P> <P> They're lawyers, like South San Gabriel resident Fumio Robert Nakahiro, who  graduated from UCLA and Loyola Law School and now works with the Arthur K.  Snyder law firm in downtown Los Angeles.  </P> <P> They're political activists, like Daniel Alvarez, who received a public policy  master's degree from the University of Michigan and now serves as a legislative  analyst in Sacramento, overseeing and monitoring California's community  colleges.  </P> <P> They're educators, like David Santamaria, a UC Santa Barbara graduate, Hacienda  Heights resident and fifth-grade teacher in El Monte. Or Joanne Carrillo, the  class president, UC Santa Barbara graduate and now a special education teacher  at Hollenback Junior High in East Los Angeles.  </P> <P> They're nurses, like Whittier resident Esther Medina Vasquez, an R.N. who works  at East Los Angeles Doctors Hospital and whose eight brothers and sisters also  are Roosevelt graduates.  </P> <P> "Just because we grew up in the barrio doesn't mean we were disadvantaged  individually," said Xochitl Cruz, a 1983 Cal State L.A. graduate who now is a  calendar coordinator for a Los Angeles law firm. "The disadvantage is in the  whole, not the individual."  </P> <P> Cruz, a member of the reunion organizing committee, added: "We were stereotyped  as barrio kids. Well, we were. But that doesn't mean you couldn't be somebody.  When you come out of the barrio, you're already at the bottom. The only way to  go is up."  </P> <P> Cruz, who has moved to Glendale from the East Side, returns often to her former  neighborhood to visit family and friends.  </P> <P> "My parents came here from Mexico in 1961, the year I was born," she said. "My  father worked for $60 a week then. Now he has his own business as a wood  turner. He recently made all the lamps for the Sheraton (hotel) in Hawaii."  </P> <P> Robles, who received scholarships and took out loans to finance his  undergraduate and medical education, credits many of his teachers at Roosevelt  for his post-graduate successes.  </P> <P> "I think we owe a lot to our teachers who believed in us and expected us to  excel," he said. "A lot of times we don't have role models. And I think a lot  of parents were responsible for this class, too. My mom was a very positive  force. She said, 'I'll help you do what you want to do.' Of course, she  couldn't help me financially. Back then, she was a clerk-typist who made  $10,000 a year and had to support four kids. My dad left home when I was 8. I  wish they had diplomas for moms. My mom should have one."  </P> <P> Robles and many of his 1979 classmates have kept in contact with Roosevelt and  other junior and senior highs in the East Los Angeles barrio, believing that  they can serve as role models for students there. "I wish we had a mechanism to  instill this need for an education in others," Robles said. "Many come back and  talk to the students. It's something that we can do for the community."  </P> <P> Lance Holliday, who grew up in the Aliso Village projects and now is a savings  counselor, insisted that he and his classmates can help other Roosevelt  students "develop a sense of pride in their school and community. . . . We were  a different type of class. Our ambitions were higher. I thought gangs were  silly. I saw a lot of my friends in them. And a lot aren't here now because of  them.  </P> <P> "I went back and was an assistant football coach the two years we won  back-to-back city championships in '84 and '85," he added. "Through football,  there was pride within the school, a sense of belonging. You've got to develop  that in these guys and get them out of the neighborhood."  </P> <P> He said he has fulfilled that hope for his own family: "My goal was to get my  mom out of the barrio. She lives in Desert Hot Springs now."  </P> <P> Holliday, who is married and lives in West Covina, said he had put his  education on hold for a while, but is back in school at Los Angeles City  College, working toward a bachelor's degree.  </P> <P> He is not the only member of his class continuing his education. Maria Rivas  Chavez, a USC graduate and an expectant mom who lives with her husband in  Paramount, has taken a leave of absence from UCLA law school; Regina Zumaya, a  Cal State L.A. graduate and Alhambra resident, is working toward her master's  degree in physical therapy.  </P> <P> Such drive for advancement is important, said Alexander Retana, a 1978  Roosevelt graduate who married his high school sweetheart, Lourdes Lara, Class  of '79. They now have two children and a Glendale condominium.  </P> <P> "A lot of people think they can't better themselves from the projects," said  Retana, who works for Rockwell International and has a semester left at Pierce  College before he earns a bachelor's degree. "I grew up in Pico Gardens  (housing project) and it is possible to get out. You have to want to do it.  It's easy to sit there and do nothing. It's harder to lift your eyes above."  </P> <P> His wife, who studied French at UCLA for a year before they married and started  a family, is a Los Angeles Department of Water and Power office manager, who  plans to return to school when her son and daughter are older.  </P> <P> Meantime, the couple plans to talk with their children about the importance of  hard work and education, he said, adding: "If more parents did that, we  wouldn't have so many problems. My father told me that -- get an education. He  showed me his big hands, rough from hard work. He said, 'I've had to work hard.  You can do better.' "  </P> <P> Interrupting his reunion chat with old friends Alvarez and Nakahiro, Santamaria  explained: "I was fortunate to have a good set of parents, and my friends, who  were a good influence on me. I love them like brothers. I had no thoughts about  going away to college and they kept after me. I put myself through school with  many jobs, at a moving company, a drugstore.  </P> <P> "My cause now is to inspire the children coming up," he added. "To be a role  model. I tell them about how important education is to them. That's what it's  all about. I had a lot of friends and family members in gangs. Some I lost. And  that's a tragedy, because there is so much potential in the barrio."  </P></p>

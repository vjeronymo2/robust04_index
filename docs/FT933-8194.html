			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / International Company News: Profits dip but Kmart optimistic on outlook KMART, the second-biggest US retailer, reported lower post-tax profits in the three months to July with core discount stores remaining under pressure and losses growing on its Pace membership warehouse operation. But the company's shares edged up Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 23 1/8 before the close in New York as Mr Joseph Antonini, chairman and chief executive, said earnings in the second half were expected to exceed last year's levels. The renewed strength in consumer spending and good weather, as well as the company's own promotional activities, had brought about an improvement in sales, he said. Net income for the second quarter, at Dollars 102m, or 22 cents a share, was down more than one-third from Dollars 168m, or 37 cents, a year ago. The company, which is in the process of revamping many of its stores to compete with the faster-growing Wal Mart, had warned at the end of June of a likely fall in profits. Sales in the core general merchandise area in the US grew to Dollars 6.6bn, or nearly 5 per cent up on a year ago on a comparable basis. However, operating income in the area fell by just under 13 per cent, to Dollars 259m, as the sales mix in the US discount stores tilted towards lower-margin goods. This reflected lower sales of higher-maring clothing, due to bad weather, Kmart said. This pushed the company's gross margin down to 23.3 per cent from 23.9 per cent. Pace, the company's troubled warehouse chain, suffered an operating loss of Dollars 39m, including the cost of selling or closing 17 stores during the period. This compared with a Dollars 24m loss in the first quarter. Also, interest costs rose to Dollars 78m from Dollars 59m a year ago on extra debt associated with acquisitions and higher inventory levels. First-half net income fell to Dollars 152m, or 33 cents a share, before special items, from Dollars 284m, or 62 cents, the year before. Sales grew by 10 per cent, to Dollars 19.2bn.</p>

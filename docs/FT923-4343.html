			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / The French Referendum: Danes may seek special status DENMARK must be given a special status within the European Community following the country's rejection of the Maastricht treaty in its June 2 referendum, Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, the leader of the Social Democratic party, said. The Danes stunned Europe in June by narrowly rejecting the Community's Maastricht Treaty in a referendum. Mr Rasmussen said Denmark must be allowed exemption from a common defence policy or a common defence force, and a common currency or economic policies which follow from the common currency. The Social Democratic party, currently in opposition, is expected to play a significant role in Denmark's negotiations with the EC because of the fragmented state of the eight-party governing coalition. Mr Rasmussen argued that Denmark could not stop the other 12 member states from proceeding with the Maastricht Treaty, if it was endorsed by the French electorate, and Denmark must therefore aim to negotiate a special status. Mr Poul Schluter, the prime minister, told Conservative party delegates at the weekend there would be a second referendum in Denmark on a new basis for Denmark's European policy, perhaps in the first half of 1993. It would offer a different agreement with the Community, since the voters could not be asked to vote twice on the Maastricht Treaty. He said his minority Conservative-Liberal coalition government would seek parliamentary approval for a new popular vote. The Social Democratic party said it would support a new referendum, giving the prime minister the majority needed to call the vote. 'We now wait for the 12 EC members to come up with an agreement proposal,' said Mr Bjorn Westh, the Social Democrats' EC affairs spokesman. Mr Schluter also repeated the government's view that the Maastricht Treaty could not come into force without Denmark's signature and said the other 12 member-states would thus have to wait for negotiations with Denmark before the treaty was implemented.</p>

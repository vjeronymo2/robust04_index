			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Tehran Fails To Prompt Damascus To </F> Boycott Peace Negotiations"]    [Text] Tehran, London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- High-ranking  Iranian sources admitted yesterday that Iran and Syria "have  agreed to differ" over the peace process in the Middle East.    Last week Iran made its last attempt to persuade Syria to  abandon the U.S.-sponsored peace talks, when a senior mullah  visited Damascus.    The mullah in question, Hassan Rohani, met with Syrian  President Hafiz al-Asad and delivered to him two messages from  "Supreme Guide" 'Ali Khamene'i and President Hashemi Rafsanjani.  He said that the two men asked al-Asad in their messages to  "reconsider" the Madrid process before visiting Tehran. But  contrary to what was rumored at the beginning, no agreement has  been reached on a date for al-Asad's visit. The Syrian  leadership is still determined to pursue the line discussed in  detail at the al-Asad-Clinton summit in Geneva in January.    On his return to Tehran, Rohani, who holds the posts of  deputy speaker of the Iranian Majles and secretary general of  the Supreme National Security Council, described the peace  process as a "conspiracy." But Syrian authorities said later  that Rohani's statement describes "just the PLO-Israeli  agreement," not the peace process as a whole.    Over the past two years Iran has tried to establish a  "rejectionist front" under its leadership. Iranian leaders say  that they understand that Syria does not want to impose  isolation on itself by pulling out of the talks. However, they  believe that Damascus is capable of adopting "courageous stands"  on the establishment of a new "rejectionist front."    Five high-ranking Iranian delegations have sought to stress  this point to the Syrians during visits to Damascus over the  past six months. One of these delegations was headed by Foreign  Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati. One was headed by Hassan Habibi,  first assistant to Rafsanjani. But these visits did not produce  joint statements on their conclusion -- which indicates the  existence of differences over vital topics.    There are two disagreements between Damascus and Tehran over  two other issues in addition to the peace process question.    The first is to do with Lebanon's future in general and  Hizballah's role in particular. It seems that Syria is  determined to disarm the party in question in all Lebanese  areas, except the south, where it is confronting the  Israeli-occupied "security belt." But Iran wants Hizballah to  remain free in all Lebanese areas.    Tehran is alarmed at the failure of Lebanese President Ilyas  al-Hirawi and Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri to visit Iran  despite their agreement "in principle" to do so.    The cause of the second disagreement between Tehran and  Damascus is Syria's support for the United Arab Emirates'  position on the dispute over the three islands [Tunb al-Kubra,  Tunb al-Sughra, and Abu Musa] situated near the Strait of Hormuz.</p>

			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Leading Article: A mega-bond for London The rage Londoners feel over the unreliability, inadequacy and squalor of their city's transport system last week reached boiling point. A power black-out trapped tens of thousands of passengers in London Underground's tunnels. Many more were left waiting for buses or delayed in traffic jams. Others stayed at home. If last week's chaos was a freak event, it could be forgiven. But it is merely the latest in the catalogue of misery that Londoners have to endure almost daily. If they travel underground, they face packed carriages, out-of-order escalators and cancellations. If they travel by road, they are often delayed in traffic. It is not just passengers who suffer. London's attraction as an international centre of wealth creation is being compromised. Companies lose out directly when employees cannot make it in to work. In the long run, business could migrate to more efficient locations. Decades of under-investment, poor management and antiquated labour practices are now bearing their bitter fruit. The urgent priority is to find extra resources. London First, the business-led group, thinks Pounds 17bn will be needed over 10 years to modernise the underground and to finance new projects such as Crossrail. Where are such vast sums going to come from? On current plans, only half will come from central government. Given the enormous budget deficit, there is little chance of more cash from that source. In fact, further cuts are possible in this week's budget. Passengers benefit Wholesale privatisation is not a realistic prospect either. The underground would only become profitable if its network was shrunk and fares increased sharply. Meanwhile, although the group set up this month under Sir Alastair Morton may inject life into the government's initiative of attracting private finance for infrastructure projects, even enthusiasts recognise that subsidies will be needed before most such schemes can be profitable. But there is no reason why this money must come from central government coffers. In so far as passengers benefit from better services, it is right that they pay more. But it is right that those who have property in the city and those who travel on its roads should also pay their share. What are needed are new mechanisms to raise funds. Why not earmark a portion of the capital's business rates and council taxes? After all, better public transport would increase property values. Or why not hypothecate revenue from London's street parking charges? Car-users would benefit from roads not being so crammed. Revenue streams Once new fund-raising devices were authorised, there would be no need to wait for the cash to trickle in. It would be possible to issue a multi-billion pound bond, secured by future revenue streams. Funds could speedily be made available to subsidise the underground's modernisation and new private-sector projects. How should such an initiative be co-ordinated? While ministers would prefer a quango - if they could be persuaded to look at the idea at all - a democratically accountable body would be better. There should be no taxation without representation. But ministers would not have to resurrect the ghost of the Labour-dominated Greater London Council. The new body would focus on transport alone. It would not own the underground and new projects. The relationship could be an arm's-length contract, under which the body provided investment funds in return for specified service improvements. With such contracts in place, it might even be possible to privatise the underground and start to sort out its management and labour problems. Other ways could be found to make the body appeal more to ministers. For example, it could cover parts of the commuter belt, so ensuring it was not always Labour-run. Its authority could be limited in time, say to a decade. Ministers might even appoint its members but require investment and fund-raising plans to be approved by referendum. Such an initiative could only be undertaken if ministers were willing to slaughter a herd of sacred cows. But, given that the alternative is continued decay, a radical approach is needed.</p>

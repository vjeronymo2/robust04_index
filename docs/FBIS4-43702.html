			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ignacio Cembrero: "Gonzalez Rules Out Confidence </F> Vote, Changing Government, and Bringing Forward Election"]    [Excerpt] Cartagena de Indias -- No confidence vote,  change of government, or early election -- at least for the  present. Head of government Felipe Gonzalez yesterday confirmed  his intention to continue to govern with the support of  Convergence and Union (CiU) despite the election defeat that he  suffered Sunday [12 June], and is prepared to do so until the  end of the legislative term. Gonzalez briefly received the  Spanish news media just before the second day of the Fourth  Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena de Indias (Colombia) began,  and did so, as he said, so that the final news conference in the  early hours of this morning would not center on Spanish  political issues.    He looked well, perhaps because he has been going about in  the Caribbean sunshine, or perhaps also because he notes "a  special affection following Sunday's electoral setback" on the  part of the Latin American heads of state attending the meeting.  "With us (in power), the assessment they make is that they have  fared very well," Gonzalez stressed, over and above the  ideological difference that may exist between the Socialists and  the democratic right.    According to Gonzalez, the first thing is to "conduct a  serious analysis before taking decisions." "Hysterical  reactions" must be avoided. At the outset, he said, "I do not  rule out submitting a confidence motion," but this initiative  should be undertaken only on the basis of the assumption that  "you could lack the support to put through budgetary or  legislative matters." "It cannot be just the consequence of an  election that does not change the parliamentary arithmetic."    If a confidence vote is ruled out for the present, so is a  cabinet reshuffle. "Government changes," he stressed, "are  decided by the prime minister when he deems it advisable on the  grounds of reorienting specific policies." "Making a change of  government is not immediately anticipated."  <H5>  Presiding Over EU </H5>   Gonzalez is confident even of remaining in charge of the  country when it is Spain's turn to preside over the European  Union (EU), during the second half of 1995. "It will not be  necessary to hold an election before 1 July of next year."  "There is sufficient political and parliamentary stability to  complete the legislative term."    He has not yet spoken with Generalitat (Catalan autonomous  government) premier Jordi Pujol, who is traveling to Djakarta  within the next few days -- "I will tell him to pass through  Cartagena en route to Indonesia," he joked -- but it seems to  him "normal" for CiU to deem the famous confidence vote  unnecessary. "They say that we discuss specific programs and  approve them. There has been no trouble. We do not believe  that it is necessary to change that in any way. It is not  necessary to change the PSOE's [Spanish Socialist Workers Party]  and CiU's guidelines, which have operated precisely and  regularly." [passage omitted]</p>

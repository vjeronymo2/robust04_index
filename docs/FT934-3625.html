			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Business and the Environment: Financial markets count the cost / Examining the need for a clear yardstick against which to measure risk The financial markets have frequently been accused of ignoring the environment. The accusation comes mainly from those who think bankers and investors should play a more positive role in promoting environmental values. Is there any truth in the charge, and if so what should be done about it? It is certainly the case that environmental factors make little impact on the price of either credit or equity. That much was admitted earlier this year when a group of financiers appointed by the UK government to advise it on environmental issues reported: 'Institutional investors have yet to focus fully on the value of environmental data in assessing companies' prospects.' But it would be wrong to say that the financial markets ignore the environment completely. They have all suffered shocks of various kinds: pollution disasters, green litigation, and the tidal wave of environmental regulation which has swamped the corporate world. The point, however, is that all these effects have been negative. So far as the financial markets are concerned, the environment is all about expense and annoyance. The more 'green' a company is, the more it is likely to be loaded with environmental compliance costs. Many companies claim their green investment gives them a competitive edge in a world where regulation and public opinion favour environmentally sound business. But the markets tend to ignore this 'upside' while doing everything they can to avoid the downside. The green funds are a force pushing in the opposite direction, but their goals are far from united, and their impact is questionable. The markets cannot be blamed for behaving as they do. They have no moral obligation to support environmental values if they cannot perceive them. This may be due to their short-sightedness, as many critics claim. But hurling this charge at them will not convince them that greenery is good. However, if markets are doing the natural thing in viewing the environment largely in terms of risk, there is one important aspect in which they still act against their own best interests. This is in failing to distinguish between different levels of environmental risk. The attitude is one of all or nothing. A company is able to secure pollution insurance one day, only to find that owing to a new pollution law or some environmental disaster, the market clams up the next. The same is true of banks: the fear of environmental liability led thousands of US banks to shut their doors to sensitive sectors like chemicals and petrol stations. This is uncharacteristic of financial markets, where the ability to grade risk is one of the driving forces behind prices. One of the main problems is lack of information: it is hard for markets to make sophisticated judgments when the information is absent or inconsistent, and when so much depends on the vagaries of the law courts, regulators and consumers. Some progress is being made through eco-auditing and the growing practice of publishing environmental company reports. Attempts have also been made to rate companies by how 'green' or environmentally benevolent they are. But these ratings are of little use to the mainstream markets which only want to know whether a company's environmental liabilities will cost them money. What the markets really need is a clear yardstick against which to measure environmental risk and rate companies according to the danger of environment-related loss. Such a scheme can be envisaged. It would have to address two basic questions about the company being rated. The first is, how large are its environmental liabilities? This would be answered by combining the growing body of publicly available information (pollution registers, court actions, eco-audits etc.) with a judgment about the quality of a company's environmental controls. The second is how well placed is the company to absorb environment-related losses? This would be answered by reference to the overall strength of the company. Thus a company with large environmental liabilities but a strong balance sheet might earn a high rating - which would upset environmentalists but provide the financial markets with the information they needed. Some people will doubtless dismiss such a scheme as superfluous because the markets would automatically discount these risks - if analysts and credit rating agencies were doing a proper job. Not necessarily. The point about the environment is that it represents a body of pressures - regulatory, legal, political - based on a common set of values which move independently from normal economic forces: an economic recovery could be accompanied by a regulatory crackdown on pollution, for example. There are enormous technical obstacles in creating such a scheme, not least who would operate it and pay for it. It will also strike many as a negative way of addressing an issue which is essentially about 'good' values. But the obstacles are not insuperable, and if the scheme identified environmentally risky companies more clearly and priced them accordingly, it follows that sound companies would benefit.

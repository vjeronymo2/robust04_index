			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brussels, February 16 (TANJUG) -- Greek request for  a special session of the European Union (E.U.) Ministerial  Council devoted to the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina has not yet  arrived to the E.U., said a E.U. spokesman.    Asked at a news conference in Brussels by TANJUG's  correspondent whether such a meeting would be held, he replied  that the E.U. was prepared to undertake adequate steps so as to  meet Athens's wish, but that, at least as regards the official  aspect, such a request has not come in yet.    Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias announced Tuesday  [15 February] his country would demand an urgent meeting of the  E.U. Ministerial Council to discuss the Bosnia crisis.  Papoulias met in Belgrade with Serbian President Slobodan  Milosevic and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic.    Feverish diplomatic activity in connection with Bosnia was  marked Wednesday in Brussels by a testimony of co-chairman of  the conference on former Yugoslavia David Owen behind closed  doors in the Foreign Affairs and Security Commission of the  European Parliament [EP].    According to well-informed sources, Owen has in an  optimistically intoned report stated the hope that everything  could end without military escalation. If this was to be done,  in his view, it was necessary to withdraw the Serb weapons  around Sarajevo, parallel with demilitarization of the city.  This would immediately be followed by demilitarization of  Mostar, as an introduction to a general peace agreement on  Bosnia.    This agreement, in his view, would be based possibly only  partly on the changed plan of the European Union which envisaged  transformation of the former Yugoslav republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina into a union of states of the three warring  peoples -- the Serbs, Muslems and Croats.    The Serb and Muslem forces clashed around Sarajevo, while  Muslems and Croats clashed around Mostar.    According to the same source, Owen warned the international  community it must take into consideration the factor Russia, but  also warn the Serbs that they could not expect unconditional  support from Russia.    The European Parliament commission, as its president Baron  Crespo told TANJUG, accepted Owen's assessments and proposals as  the sole realistic basis to attain peace in Bosnia.</p>

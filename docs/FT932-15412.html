			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / UN asks EC for food aid to Bosnia THE United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Mrs Sadako Ogata, yesterday appealed urgently to European Community countries for food aid for Bosnia, as officials warned the UN had practically run out of supplies to feed the country's stricken population. 'We have only enough for one day,' Mr John Macmillan, UNHCR spokesman in Sarajevo, said. Other UNHCR officials in Geneva said an average of only three days' supplies were left in UN warehouses throughout former Yugoslavia. Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, said in response to Mrs Ogata's appeal that Britain was pressing the European Commission to make available food already approved by member countries. A UK official said his government was deeply concerned by the aid situation in Bosnia and was 'disappointed' other EC countries had not matched a British Pounds 15m emergency food aid contribution last month. A UN relief convoy which reached the besieged east Bosnian town of Srebrenica yesterday evacuated 800 refugees, including 150 injured women and children. UN officials confirmed 56 people had been killed on Monday by what they called an outrageous artillery attack on the town by the Serbs. Mr Macmillan claimed: 'In their drive to acquire territory, the Serbs are willing to kill anybody to achieve their aims.' His remarks were aimed, at, among others, the deputy commander of the Bosnian Serb army, Gen Milan Gvero, who has accused the Moslem defenders of Srebrenica of having improvised explosions to convince the UN that Serbs had shelled the town. Mr Barry Frewer, spokesman for UN protection forces in former Yugoslavia, said the Unprofor commander, Gen Lars-Eric Wahlgren, had written to Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb political leader, to express his revulsion at the attack.</p>

The estimated margins are shown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Case History <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since the initiation of this investigation on March 21, 1994, (59 FR 14148, March 25, 1994), the following events have occurred. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On April 14, 1994, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) issued an affirmative preliminary injury determination ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> see <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , ITC Investigation No. 731&hyph;TA&hyph;692). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with 19 CFR 353.42(b)(1994), on April 29, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) issued its antidumping duty questionnaire to Taekwang Bend Ind. Co., Inc. (Taekwang), the South Korean company which accounts for more than 60 percent of all exports of the subject merchandise to the U.S. during the POI. The Department has received no response to this questionnaire. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On June 30, 1994, petitioner requested a 50-day postponement of the preliminary determination. The request was granted by the Department on July 19, 1994 (59 FR 37961, July 26, 1994). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Scope of Investigation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The products covered by this investigation are certain carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings (``pipe fittings'') having an inside diameter of less than fourteen inches (355 millimeters), imported in either finished or unfinished condition. Pipe fittings are formed or forged steel products used to join pipe sections in piping systems were conditions require permanent welded connections, as distinguished from fittings based on other methods of fastening ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , threaded, grooved, or bolted fittings). Butt-weld fittings come in a variety of shapes which include ``elbows,'' ``tees,'' ``caps,'' and ``reducers.'' The edges of finished pipe fittings are beveled, so that when a fitting is placed against the end of a pipe (the ends of which have also been beveled), a shallow channel is created to accommodate the ``bead'' of the weld which joins the fitting to the pipe. These pipe fittings are currently classifiable under subheading 7307.93.3000 of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (``HTSUS''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the HTSUS subheading is provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this proceeding is dispositive. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Period of Investigation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The period of investigation is September 1, 1993, through February 28, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Best Information Available <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Taekwang did not respond to our questionnaire. Therefore, we have based our preliminary determination on best information available (BIA) pursuant to section 776(c) of the Act, which provides that the Department shall use BIA when a company identified by the Department as a respondent refuses to provide requested information. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In determining what rate to use as BIA, the Department follows a two-tiered methodology, whereby the Department normally assigns lower margins to those respondents who cooperated in an investigation and margins based on more adverse assumptions for those respondents who did not cooperate in an investigation. According to this methodology, as outlined in the <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Antifriction Bearings, Other than Tapered Roller Bearings, from Germany,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 54 FR 18992w, 19033 (May 3, 1989), when a company refuses to provide the information requested in the form required, or otherwise significantly impedes the Department's investigation, it is appropriate for the Department to assign to that company the higher of (1) the highest margin alleged in the petition, or (2) the highest calculated rate of any respondent in the investigation. ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See Allied Signal Aerospace Co. v. United States,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 996 F. 2d 1185, 1191&hyph;92 (Fed. Cir. 1993).) Because there were no cooperative respondents in this investigation, we are assigning to all exporters, as BIA, the highest margin calculated in the petition, as adjusted for methodological errors as explained in the Department's initiation notice, 207.89 percent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Suspension of Liquidation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with section 733(d)(1) of the Act, we are directing the Customs Service to suspend liquidation of all entries of pipe fittings from South Korea that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of this notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or posting of a bond equal to the estimated preliminary dumping margin, as shown below. The suspension of liquidation will remain in effect until further notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 2,L2,tp0,i1,s10,8 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> &blank; <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Manufacturer/Producer/Exporter <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Margin percentage <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> All companies <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 207.89 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

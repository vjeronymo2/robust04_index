			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Major A. Kazakov: "You Can't Substitute Oats for </F> Meat"]    [Text] There are strict scientific substantiations  to the nutritional norm for aviators. It replenishes the body  with what it needs, with what aviators expend while performing  their assignments in the sky and servicing equipment, and  ensures flight safety and a long flying career. This is why much  attention is devoted in all countries of the world to  maintaining the health and raising the combat readiness of  aviators. In the times before perestroyka this matter was never  neglected in the fleet's air units. But recently aviators have  started experiencing discomfort in their diet as well. Because  economic ties that had existed in the former Union have been  disturbed, the thread of fleet food supply has broken. It is  becoming increasingly more difficult for rear services of the  fleet air forces to ensure the minimum ration necessary for  sensible, high quality nutrition for flight crews, engineers and  technicians. It's now a long-established practice to substitute  one food product for another of far from equal nutritional value  when a shortage occurs in a certain assortment of foods.  Experience shows that such "transformations" are far from  harmless.    A certain food service worker joked to me that if you wanted  to, you could "translate" the calorie count of even meat into  oats, and serve them as food. It might of course go this far if  the economy's disintegration continues at the current rate. But  I think everyone realizes what the result of all of this could  be.    "We manage as best we can," said Lieutenant Colonel V.  Molchanov, deputy commander of the aviation technical base of  the Kacha garrison. "We get the needed food products either on  the basis of our enthusiasm and personal time, or through  acquaintances and good relations with various executives. We get  them from kolkhozes and sovkhozes on credit, on the basis of our  word. Only the food specialists know what we've had to do to  manage thus far."    Well, I'm not about to reveal the secrets of the suppliers.  And here is why. A certain article in our newspaper said that  because electric power had been shut off from the Kacha  garrison, the command found a way to use local electric power  sources for the time of the shut-down to keep the dining halls,  boiler plants and offices running. On learning this, workers of  the rayon electric power network switched off the electric power  for 2 days before New Years. The reason they gave was that the  garrison had its own electric power sources.    Consequently food suppliers wisely refuse to say anything  more about how they manage to supply the needed food products to  the aviators' dining hall. The whole thing might backfire, you  see. The main thing is that the suppliers, who take the  experience of the perestroyka years into account, no longer wait  for central deliveries, and instead establish direct ties with  the producers. This allows them to provide at least the minimum  ration to the personnel.    But something does need to be said about the numerous  instances of disorganization that rear service workers have to  deal with in obtaining food for military units. Here are just a  few of them, as related by Colonel V. Yankovskiy, commander of  the aviation technical base of the Kacha garrison.    "We can get meat from Simferopol. But they demand  prepayment,  and we have no money in the unit.    "It's no secret that we've recently been receiving food from  Russia. The rail cars travel thousands of kilometers to us.  You'd think that it would be simple--just meet the cars, unload  them, and truck the supplies to the unit. But it isn't. Customs  officials are always on the watch. If you don't draw up a  customs declaration within 3 days, which isn't always possible,  they take a large percentage for the idle time of the car. And  not from just anyone, but from the military units, which don't  even have enough money to cover the pay of the servicemen. There  are many such discrepancies."    However, despite all of these difficulties, which are  sometimes created deliberately, rear service workers are  fulfilling their tasks successfully. And the persistence of  commanders has a lot to do with it. This is evident at least  from the following case.    Bread for military units of the Kacha garrison comes from  far  away. Every trip means many liters of precious gasoline. The  command of the aviation technical base suggested many times that  2 days' worth of bread should be delivered on Saturday. Then the  Sunday trip could be dropped. But its efforts were in vain. It  was then that Lieutenant Colonel Molchanov went to the bakery  himself. He substantiated all of the pros and cons, and  demonstrated that this would be more advantageous both to the  supplier and to the consumer. And so the issue was finally  resolved.    Then things like this happen. Today there are food products  in the storage depots, but tomorrow there might not be any.  You'd think that there would be nothing simpler than to pick up  enough to last a while, and the problem would be solved. But  that's not the case. Having become accustomed to centralized,  regular and constant deliveries in the "period of stagnation,"  units didn't create large storage capacities. And now the  housekeepers are finding that these capacities are extremely  small, and can't satisfy anyone. And so, now they have to run  around each day, scrounging food and making deals with the  "right" people, so that they could somehow "requisition" some of  what the aviators are supposed to get.    And there's no end to this. The people are weary of it.  They're becoming nervous, and unsure about tomorrow. This is  having an effect on mutual relations in the collectives, and it  is influencing combat readiness. But we can't go on trying the  patience of men in uniform forever.    Wouldn't it be simpler to put aside the ethnic strife, to  heal the fracture that occurred between Slavic peoples out of  someone's stupidity, and restore the economic and social ties  that were broken by the ambitious political activity of today's  politicians? Divided we fall.</p>

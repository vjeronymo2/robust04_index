			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [All figures as published] </F>   [Text] The treasury, which has become very popular among  investors because of the bonds it has issued with extremely high  interest rates in order to reactivate the internal borrowing  market, will have to pay an enormous debt in the next four  months. It has to pay $1.66 billion for foreign debts and 261.5  trillion Turkish lira [TL] for internal debts from June to  September 1994.    The treasury is expected to pay $510 million for Turkey's  foreign debts in June. That will be the highest installment  from June to September. August will be the most critical month  in the repayment of Turkey's internal debts. The treasury will  pay TL134 trillion for internal debts and TL18 trillion for  salaries in that month.  <H5>  Internal Debts </H5>   According to the treasury's plans on the flow of currency,  TL40 trillion will be paid for internal debts and 18 trillion  for salaries in June, 40.5 trillion will be paid for internal  debts and 18 trillion for salaries in July, 134 trillion will be  paid for internal debts and 18 trillion for salaries in August,  and 47 trillion will be paid for internal debts and 18 trillion  for salaries in September.    Plans were made to allocate TL74 trillion for capital and  interest payments in August. However, issuing TL40 trillion  worth of bonds at an interest rate of 50 percent and the 20  trillion interest on the bonds have increased that amount to  TL134 trillion.    Treasury officials have said that additional borrowing will  be unavoidable for the repayment of Turkey's internal debts in  August.  <H5>  Foreign Debts </H5>   Treasury will pay $1.660 billion for Turkey's foreign debts  by the end of September. It will pay $510 million in June, $320  million in July, $400 million in August, and $430 million in  September.    Consequently, the funds that will be secured from the IMF  and  the World Bank will be mostly used for the repayment of Turkey's  foreign debts.</p>

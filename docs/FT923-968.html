			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / The Property Market: A dismal August In August, commercial property posted its worst performance so far this year, according to the Investment Property Databank, an independent research group, writes Vanessa Houlder. Total returns slipped back to -0.2 per cent, the lowest single monthly return in 1992. A 0.05 percentage point rise in equivalent yield caused capital values to fall by a full percentage point, the single largest fall this year. August's poor results have dragged down the year-on-year results, with the total return for the year to August falling back to 1.8 per cent. Rental values continue to fall, dropping by half a percentage point to -7.5 per cent for the year ending August. The gap between retail and industrial returns continues to widen, as yields in the industrial sector were driven upwards. The average equivalent yield was pushed to its highest level yet at 11.2 per cent. Retails were the only sector to show a positive return, with a total return of 0.1 per cent. Office property was the worst hit sector. Rental and capital values fell by about 1.5 percentage points and total returns fell almost half a point below July's return at -0.8 per cent. The industrial sector has shown signs of volatility, with a total return in August of -0.2 per cent.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        IPD monthly index  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Monthly change (index based at Dec 1986 = 100)                       Aug 1992       Jul 1992       Change IPD                    167.45         167.86         0.18 Retail                 155.79         155.61         0.80 Office                 158.33         159.55        -0.62 Industrial             232.91         133.29        -0.27  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

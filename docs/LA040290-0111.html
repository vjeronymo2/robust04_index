			<p><P> April 2, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> U.S. TO PUSH ENERGY, ENVIRONMENT ISSUES  </P> <P> The Bush Administration said today that it is getting very serious about energy  conservation and environmental issues and suggested that the programs were  given short shrift under President Ronald Reagan.  </P> <P> Secretary of Energy James D. Watkins made the assessment as he released an  interim report on an energy strategy his department plans to submit to  President Bush in December.  </P> <P> The 230-page report summarized views expressed in 12,000 pages of testimony  taken at 15 public hearings that began in August.  </P> <P> The report draws no conclusions, but presents an array of possibilities and  lists potential obstacles, including objections of industry groups.  </P> <P> "The loudest single message was to increase energy efficiency in every sector  of energy use," Watkins said. "Energy efficiency was seen as a way to reduce  pollution, reduce dependence on oil imports and reduce the cost of energy."  </P> <P> In response to a question, Watkins said environmental concerns will be a  significant factor in shaping the final report.  </P> <P> 'I don't think the department has been that forthcoming in those areas in the  past and we are getting very serious about it at the direction of the  President," he said.  </P> <P> The report calls for examination of strict conservation requirements and  government-financed development of renewable alternative energy sources such as  hydroelectric dams and geothermal power.  </P> <P> Reagan stoutly opposed such measures, arguing that energy issues should be left  to the marketplace. He even advocated doing away with the Energy Department.  </P> <P> Bush, in asking for the energy strategy, said, "A keystone of this strategy is  going to be the continuation of the successful policy of market reliance."  </P></p>

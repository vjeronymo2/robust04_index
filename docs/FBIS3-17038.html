In the last few days, they have organized a whole series of  protest pickets and gatherings by ultra-patriots with  resolutions containing the old demand for the mandatory mention  in the treaty's preamble of the so-called "Zeligowski march on  Vilnius," as a result of which, for over 20 years, the  Lithuanian capital of Vilnius was called the city of Wilno and  was the center of the East Polish province.    A patriotic furor was raised by Romualdas Ozolas, leader of  the Centrist Alliance party and member of the Seimas, who is  also one of Lithuania's most influential politicians. Known for  his territorial claims against Kaliningrad Oblast and suspicion  toward neighboring Belorussia [Belarus], he reacted extremely  negatively to the preliminary results of talks between the  Lithuanian Foreign Ministry and the Poles, and to the ministry's  pragmatic stance -- namely, not to make historical appraisals  but to limit itself to a recognition of the inviolability of  borders, as is the accepted practice throughout the world. In  the midst of the arguments, the leader of the Lithuanian  centrists even named the Polish ambassador in Vilnius as a  secret service staffer (later, the Belorussian ambassador in  Lithuania was also credited with this "flattering"  characteristic).    A scandal broke. The Lithuanian Foreign Ministry was obliged  to express regret over such appraisals and interpretations of  the treaty. At this point, representatives of certain  right-wing organizations and movements came to the aid of the  chief Lithuanian patriot. Picketing of the Foreign Ministry,  the Seimas, and the president's residence began. A propaganda  campaign was launched in the newspapers. The Lithuanian Foreign  Ministry made a statement noting in particular: The country's  state interests are reflected in the draft treaty, and its text  will not be published before signing -- in line with a decree of  the Lithuanian Government on the nonpublication of treaties  being prepared for signing, and which are on the same footing as  state secrets. The Foreign Ministry recalled that, as a rule,  the competence of the foreign policy department is verified  during the ratification in parliament of agreements prepared by  diplomats.    In all probability, official Vilnius will not fall under the  thumb of local nationalists. President Algirdas Brazauskas is  determined to sign this treaty, which is so important for both  countries. A telephone conversation on this subject took place  between him and Polish President Lech Walesa, and both leaders  expressed support for the bilateral agreement.    On the other hand, the Lithuanian authorities realize that  the national radicals, by playing the Polish card, are not in  the least concerned about state security, but rather about  political advantage. In an effort to rock the atmosphere in the  country, the ruling Democratic Labor Party believes, they are  prepared even to rouse the dissatisfaction of the local Poles  densely populating South East Lithuania. Therefore, the ruling  majority is unlikely to allow the initiative to be snatched back  by those who strive for power through any means. The  authorities will firmly stand their ground, otherwise the  nationalists may spoil everthing -- relations with Poland, and  relations with the local Poles.</p>

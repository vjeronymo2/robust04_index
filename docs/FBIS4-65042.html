			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sezai Sengun: "Rising Dollar Parity Hits F-16 </F> Project"]    [Text] Ankara--The strengthening U.S. dollar has doubled  the amount of Turkish lira required for several important  projects in the defense domain in Turkey. That has created  anxiety that the modernization projects for the Turkish Armed  Forces may be delayed. In fact, the contracting for several  projects has been postponed. The project for the production of  F-16 aircraft was the first to be affected by the financial  crisis. The Turkish Defense Fund, which was established by  Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, the United  States, and Turkey after the Gulf War was to have been used for  the production of 160 F-16 aircraft. Turkey's share in the  fund, which totals approximately $3.5 billion, is $500 million.    Turkey did not find it difficult to contribute $100 million  to that fund before the value of the Turkish lira against the  dollar fell. However, Ankara is now worried about how to  fulfill the remaining part of its obligation, which totals $400  million. The effort made to create an annual source for 50  million Turkish lira for the installments Turkey has to pay to  the fund has not yielded results because the Defense Industry  Executive Committee, which is chaired by Prime Minister Ciller,  has been unable to meet.    Meanwhile, it has been reported that several of the delayed  contracts have been shelved. Those that are expected to be  suspended are:    1. Modernization of F-5 and F-4 aircraft. Many of Turkey's  F-5 and F-4 aircraft were to have been modernized. The  modernization of each of Turkey's F-5 and F-4 aircraft will cost  $3 million and $700 million respectively.    2. Multiple rocket launchers. Turkey purchased 12 multiple  rocket launchers in the past. It received an offer by the  manufacturing firm for another 24 launchers.    3. Naval helicopters. The purchase of four naval  helicopters, which the naval forces have asked for, is another  project that has been affected by the decrease in the value of  the Turkish lira against the U.S. dollar.    4. Minesweepers. A decision was made to purchase six  minesweepers in 1989. Offers were made to Turkey by several  firms. It has been reported that the project will cost  approximately $1 billion.    5. Antiaircraft fire control systems. Several firms offered  to sell 35-mm automatic antiaircraft fire control systems to  Turkey at the end of 1991. However, Ankara asked for offers on  a new list of requirements that was drawn up by the General  Staff.    6. Sikorsky helicopters. An effort is being made to find a  source of $500 million for 50 Sikorsky helicopters. Plans have  been made to have them manufactured in Turkey. However, it has  been reported that the project will be delayed until 1995.    7. Border security. The establishment of "physical security  barriers" on Turkey's eastern and southeastern border is another  defense project that has been affected by the decrease in the  value of the Turkish lira against the dollar. The physical  barriers are required for obstructing the infiltration of  Workers Party of Kurdistan militants into Turkey. The project  required an allocation of 4 trillion Turkish lira in 1994.  Meanwhile, the fate of the project for unmanned reconnaissance  aircraft, which will contribute toward the maintenance of border  security, has also been linked to the situation of the Turkish  lira against the U.S. dollar. The Turkish Space and Aviation  Industry has manufactured and successfully tested several of  these aircraft.</p>

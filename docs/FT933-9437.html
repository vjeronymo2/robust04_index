			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Arts: Weir and Saxton - New music at the Proms Judith Weir is unquestionably one of the most individual voices in British music today, composer of two widely acclaimed operas (the first, A Night at the Chinese Opera, almost a paradigm of what opera in the late 20th century can be), and an array of sharply focused, always fresh and original concert works. Yet her output so far contains relatively little orchestral music - only the chamber-sized Isti Mirant Stella (1981) has real substance and engagement. In Thursday's Prom Martyn Brabbins conducted the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra in the London premiere of Weir's Music, Untangled from 1991. It was part of a curiously assorted programme that began with the Pas de Six from Britten's Prince of the Pagodas and Dvorak's Cello Concerto (Sophie Rolland the less than assertive soloist) and ended with Prokofiev's Seventh Symphony. Weir takes a Scottish folk melody and projects it through a series of transformations which are always oblique and teasing. The whole bustling process only lasts about eight minutes, though this, evidently, was a new enlarged version, and the music brings echoes of Janacek (in the jump-cut transitions) and Tippett (of Midsummer Marriage and Sellinger's Round mode). As so often with Weir the music itself exudes no positive personality. The charm, skill and distinction in her work stems much more from the artful arrangements of the musical objects than from the flavour of the invention; the constantly diverting contexts, the unexpected continuities make up the expressive palette. Her method is at its most captivating in a theatrical context - hence the success of the operas and the tours de force of pieces like King Harald's Saga, where narrative conceits can be mixed in; it is much harder to bring off in the more or less abstract world of an orchestral piece. Music, Untangled is an effective concert filler, but Weir's eventual breakthrough as an orchestral composer will require a much broader, more ambitious canvas. ***** Robert Saxton's strongly imagined, coherent and continuously vivid Viola Concerto came to the Proms the following evening - this was the work's first London performance, seven years after its 1986 Cheltenham premiere. A 'face in the crowd' image is the nub of its argument: Saxton constantly places the viola, which he describes as 'the most human instruments', at odds with a small orchestra expertly used to convey menace - hard-edged, coolly bated, or darkly immanent as may be, but always sharply contrasted in tone with the eloquently 'human' utterances of the soloist. Though Saxton does not specify the point, one might go further and divine in the work's alienated drum-patterings, chilling piano arabesques and occasional harshly squealing high clarinets an 'urban' subtext. The influence of Bartok's Miraculous Mandarin, that most extreme of 20th-century musical cityscapes, is everywhere: the dramatic contrasts of mood afford the music a graphic quality of which Bartok would not have been at all ashamed. He might also admired the formal orderliness of Saxton's four (linked) movements, in which the traditional demands of concerto form and a thoroughly modern sense of timbre and texture are smoothly reconciled. In a way, there is something even a bit 'pat' about the composer's smoothing over of joins, sanding away of all rough edges - Saxton's later orchestral works are bolder, freer with form. But the concerto is so assured, so gripping for the listener, and plainly so rewarding for a violist of Paul Silverthorne's calibre to play (he was the work's inspirer and first soloist), that this hardly counts as serious criticism. No less plainly, the City of London Sinfonia under Richard Hickox were roused by it - as they had been, earlier in the concert, by Nicholas Daniel's gloriously witty, urbane, technically breathtaking account of the Strauss Oboe Concerto, but as they had not been by Rossini (Turk in Italy Overture, leaden) or Wolf (Italian Serenade, stodgy).</p>

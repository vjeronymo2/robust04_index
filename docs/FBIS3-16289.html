			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] As you know, the process of the disintegration of  the USSR and sovereignization of the republics within Russia was  accompanied by a forced introduction to the Russian language of  new names of some states, republics, their capitals, and some  cities. At the same time, in most cases it was an attempt to  replace the names adopted in the Russian language with the names  in the languages of these states, republics, and cities.  However, in any language any borrowed word is always  subordinated to new grammar and pronunciation laws and, in  practice, never retains its original form.    Therefore Russian language speakers have as many rights to  pronounce Ashkhabad, Kushka, Kirgizia, and Belorussia, as  speakers of other languages, for example, have every right to  use Russian names in the form adopted in their languages. In  this particular case it is correspondence to linguistic laws  that is under discussion.    The Institute of Russian Language of the Russian Academy of  Sciences supports the intention to go back to old names. From  15 March, Russian television and radio will begin using them  consistently so that from now on Almaty will again become  Alma-Ata, Bashkortostan -- Bashkiria. Our congratulations to  you.    It would be interesting to know what will be the reaction at  the Ostankino TV and Radio Company since this initiative comes  from the Russian TV and Radio Company.</p>

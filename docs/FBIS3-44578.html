He is Anatoliy Lukyanov, who once served as the president of  the former Supreme Soviet of USSR and has been accused of being  involved in the August 19 coup attempt in 1991.    Lukyanov was elected into Russia's new parliament "The State  Duma" last December as a candidate of the Russian Communist  Party. He failed to appear before the special military tribunal  in recent trials for health reasons.    In his letter to Lukyanov, Yeltsin said that there exists a  "possibility of fruitful cooperation" between them.    Yeltsin suggested that Lukyanov "share the responsibility  for  the destiny of the Russian Federation and its citizens" and  offer his advice on the relationship between president and  parliament.    The episode was revealed today when the military tribunal  resumed the trial of the accused in the August 19 incident,  Ostankino State Radio and Television Broadcasting Company  reported.    Since Lukyanov was elected into the new parliament, the  tribunal has received letters calling for his immunity from  trials.    The tribunal rejected the appeals on the ground that there  is  no special provisions in the Constitution concerning the  criminal immunity for members of parliament.</p>

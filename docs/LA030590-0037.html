			<p><P> March 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Channel One Debuts: Channel One, a news show with advertisements aimed at  teen-agers, debuts today in 400 schools across the country amid an uproar over  whether the two minutes of commercials included in each 12-minute show corrupts  the school day.  </P> <P> Several national education groups are opposing Channel One and officials in  California and New York have prohibited public schools in those states from  carrying the program. In addition, North Carolina has asked a state court to  enforce its board of education's ban on the program. Channel One maintains that  the commercials are essential because the $150,000 charge for each 30-second  commercial pays for the $150 million in video equipment loaned to schools that  show the program.

Ecu 9 million has been included in the draft budget for 1994  approved by the Commission.    Mr. Flynn stressed that despite the huge efforts being made  in Europe to combat AIDS, the epidemic was continuing to grow:  by March 1993, 84,000 AIDS cases had been reported in the  Community and it is estimated that about 500,000 people are  infected by HIV.    The new measures being proposed take account of the changes  in the pattern of the epidemic and also the results from an  interim evaluation of the present 1992-1993 programme. The new  proposals place particular emphasis on tackling several issues  of growing concern in the Member States, including:    - AIDS and drug abuse;    - HIV transmission in prison;    - HIV transmission linked to travel and tourism;    - the increasing number of women and children with the  disease;    - fighting discrimination against those affected.    The "Europe Against AIDS" Programme is implemented mainly by  supporting projects in Member States in the various areas of  activity identified in the programme. Projects submitted for  funding are assessed by an Advisory Committee on the basis of  criteria such as their relevance for public health and whether  or not there is a "Community added value". About 80 projects  had been assisted by end-1992.    The Commission also intends drawing up long-term proposals  for the fight against AIDS; which will form part of the strategy  on public health being developed on the basis of the Treaty on  European Union once it is ratified.</p>

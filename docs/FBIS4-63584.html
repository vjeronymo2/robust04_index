			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Boris Krivoshey and </F> Aleksandr Krylovich]    [Text] Moscow, 24 May -- Russia firmly insists on a purely  political settlement of the problems between Kiev and  Simferopol. This was announced at today's briefing by Grigoriy  Karasin, director of the Russian Foreign Ministry Information  and Press Department.    The Russian diplomat stressed that differences between Kiev  and Simferopol are "purely an internal affair of Ukraine."  However, he said that some Ukrainian politicians are trying to  put the blame for this on "external forces", unambiguously  implying that they mean Russia.    "As for our position with regard to the sovereign Republic  of  Crimea, which is an integral part of Ukraine, this position has  not changed and is well known to the Ukrainian leadership," the  Foreign Minister spokesman said. "Like the Ukrainian side, we  too are naturally concerned about possible tensions in  Russo-Ukrainian relations over Crimea," he noted. "We agree  that such CSCE principles of international law as territorial  integrity and inviolability of existing borders should be  observed universally. But no less important is respect for the  sovereign will of the peoples' show of restraint and the need to  rule out the use or the threat to use any strong-arm methods in  solving political problems."    G. Karasin stressed that in the opinion of the Russian  Foreign Ministry, "the situation in Crimea is further proof that  key questions of Russo-Ukrainian relations should be solved  promptly." According to the Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman,  it is these problems and not the situation in Crimea that are  being discussed at the Russian-Ukrainian talks at the level of  heads of governments, which began in Moscow yesterday and which  are continuing today.</p>

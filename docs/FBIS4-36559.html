			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Tunis, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Sudanese Foreign  Minister Dr. Husayn Abu-Salih has stressed that no transient  problems or differences can harm crucial relations between Sudan  and Egypt.    Abu-Salih, who is heading his country's delegation to the  OAU  Foreign Ministers Council meetings in Tunis, told AL-SHARQ  AL-AWSAT that, "no matter how we describe the phase  Sudanese-Egyptian relations are experiencing, we in Sudan  believe that we must overcome minor things and move toward the  major and sublime aim of restoring relations between the two  countries to their normal course in the interests of the two  peoples who have existed in the Nile Valley for thousands of  years."    Dr. Abu-Salih attributed the strain in relations between  Sudan and Egypt to "the lack of mutual trust between the  Sudanese and Egyptian sides. Thus we must work sincerely to  restore trust between the two sides."    The Sudanese foreign minister stressed that "a serious  bilateral dialogue is the only way to build strong and sound  relations between Egypt and Sudan."    He said optimistically and confidently that, "whatever the  problems, we are confident that we will work to restore our  relations to their normal status in which the Sudanese and  Egyptian people see their common destiny."    Asked about his country's support for extremist movements,  the main cause of the strain in relations between Sudan and the  countries suffering as a result of this phenomenon, Abu-Salih  said, "We are against religious, and even nonreligious,  extremism. We advocate moderation and believe that many of the  accusations leveled at Sudan in this connection are absolutely  baseless."    He added that his country "is seeking to lay the foundations  for serious action among all the Arab states in order to move  toward solidarity and to secure all the factors that serve the  security and stability of all the peoples of the Arab and  African regions."

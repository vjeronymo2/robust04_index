He said the aim of this meeting is to coordinate stances on  resuming the Arab-Israeli peace talks and discuss the effects of  the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre on the peace process.    In exclusive statements to MENA, Subayh said that Egypt is  making intensive diplomatic moves with the United States, the  Palestinians, and the Israelis to find a way out of the deadlock  that the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations reached following the  massacre perpetrated by the settlers in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque.    He noted that Egypt's efforts aim to convince Israeli Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Rabin to show more flexibility toward the fair  Palestinian demands to resume the peace negotiations. He noted  that the Palestinian demands focus on the need to provide  international protection for the Palestinian people, reduce the  number of settlements, disarm the settlers, and release the  Palestinian detainees.</p>

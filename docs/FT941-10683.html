			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / International Company News: Suez confirms modest profit Mr Gerard Worms, chairman of Suez, the French industrial and financial holding company, has confirmed that it came back into the black with a 'modest' profit last year after making its first loss in 1992. Suez, surrounded by speculation about the possible disposal of Victoire, its insurance subsidiary, fell into the red with a net deficit of FFr1.87bn (Dollars 317m) in 1992 due to the economic recession and its heavy debts. Mr Worms said Suez's 1993 results would be 'positive, but modest'. The group, which was badly affected in 1992 by the downturn in the French property market, had attempted last year to alleviate the pressure on its finances by raising capital from asset sales. However, the continued problems of the property market in 1993 wiped out the profits from its large disposals. This included the sale last year of Victoire's controlling interest in Colonia, the German insurer, to Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), the French insurance group. Mr Worms said 1994 should mark 'a new stage in Suez's return to profitability' but predicted the group would not return to 'a satisfactory level of profitability' until 1995. He said that Suez was nearing the end of its asset sale programme, but declined to comment on recent reports that it was close to concluding a deal to sell Victoire. BAT, the London-based conglomerate, has been mooted as a possible purchaser for Victoire: as have Allianz, the German insurance group, and Italy's Generali.</p>

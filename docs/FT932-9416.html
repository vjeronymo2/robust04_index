			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: S African mine group may miss out on Billiton assets SOME OF the juiciest mining and metals assets which Gencor wants to buy from the Royal Dutch/Shell group might slip from the South African group's clutches because other companies have pre-emptive rights to them. This means that Shell's mining and metals business, Billiton, must give its partners in the joint ventures an opportunity to match any terms it is willing to accept from a third party. The assets involved are: The Boddington mine in Western Australia, which last year produced nearly 352,000 troy ounces of gold. Billiton owns 30 per cent and its partners are Reynolds Metals, the US aluminium group with 40 per cent, Newcrest, the Australian mining company, 20 per cent, and Kobe Aluminium Associates of Japan, 10 per cent. The associated Worsley Alumina business, which mines bauxite, aluminium ore, and refines it into alumina, an intermediate product. Worsley's annual capacity was recently expanded to 1.5m tonnes of bauxite. The shareholders and their holdings are the same as for Boddington. Alumar of Brazil, which produces about 1m tonnes of alumina and 350,000 tonnes of aluminium a year. Billiton owns 40 per cent of the alumina refinery and 47 per cent of the aluminium smelter. Alcoa of the US owns the rest. Valesul, a Brazilian aluminium producer (annual capacity 92,000 tonnes) where Billiton owns 41.5 per cent, Cia Vale do Rio Doce of Brazil 49.5 per cent and Multisilicon 9 per cent. The Collahuasi copper project in Chile, expected to start up in 1996-97. A company owned by Minorco and its parent Anglo American Corporation of South Africa recently paid Dollars 190m (Pounds 123.3m) for a one-third stake in Collahuasi. The rest is shared equally by Falconbridge of Canada and Billiton. While Billiton's partners in these joint ventures are suffering financially because of present low metal prices, they might be reluctant to pass up the opportunity to acquire more of these assets. Much will depend on the prices Gencor is ready to offer - there are indications that these might be what other companies would consider to be on the high side. It is suggested that Gencor is willing to pay more than the Dollars 1.8bn book value of the Billiton assets because the move is of tremendous strategic importance to the South African group. Other interests Gencor has bid for include: the Cadjebut lead-zinc mine in Australia (Billiton, 42 per cent); the wholly-owned Selbaie copper-zinc operations in Canada; Cerro Matoso nickel (52.3 per cent) in Colombia; the Bogusu gold mine in Ghana (81 per cent); the Lerokis gold mine in Indonesia (90 per cent); and the Pering lead-zinc operations in South Africa (100 per cent). Gencor obviously has great faith in the future of aluminium - it is backing a Dollars 2bn project in South Africa for Alusaf to build a 466,000-tonne aluminium smelter, the western world's biggest ever - and so, apart from the previously-mentioned operations in Australia and Brazil, it has also bid for Billiton's other alumina operations: Paranam in Surinam (76 per cent) and Aughinish in Ireland (35 per cent). Gencor also wants Billiton's global metals trading and marketing network - which would certainly help sell some of the extra aluminium from Alusaf. Billiton's other downstream operations are conspicuous by their absence from the list, the most glaring omission being the half-share of the Budelco zinc smelter in the Netherlands. South African exchange control rules prevent Gencor exporting cash to pay for the Shell assets, so it will have to borrow a great deal if its offer succeeds. However, Shell has given Gencor and its adviser, SG Warburg, an exclusive option allowing them 120 days grace in which to work on that problem.</p>

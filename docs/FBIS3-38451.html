			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Federal Chancellor Franz Vranitzky </F> by Robert Hochner; Hochner is in the ORF studio in Vienna,  Vranitzky's location not given -- live]    [Text] [Hochner] Chancellor, what is the point of  Austrian attempts to stop the completion of the Temelin nuclear  power plant after this clear -- and one is tempted to say harsh  -- "no" from Prague?    [Vranitzky] The more difficult a political issue is, the  more levelheaded the statesmen have to be. I have heard that  [Czech Prime Minister] Mr. Klaus said today that the decision in  favor of Temelin is a decision by the sovereign Czech state, and  Prague is not willing to accept any interference in its  sovereignty. The point, however, is that this is not a question  of sovereignty. The sovereignty of the Czech Republic is as  undisputed as is Austria's. The real point is that if an  accident were to occur, a nuclear power plant, particularly one  that is so close to the Austrian state border, is not only a  risk for the sovereign Czech Republic, but also a risk for the  people who live in the neighboring countries. This is why I have  been trying hard for years to make people carefully reconsider  the completion or the construction of any new nuclear power  plants and to look for alternatives in terms of energy policy.    Moreover, Mr. Klaus said that we Austrians always henpeck  the  Czech Republic and not, for example, Germany or Switzerland.  This is not true. We are not happy about any nuclear power  plant in our neighborhood. Yet, the half-completed or completed  nuclear power plants in the Czech and Slovak Republics all use  Russian technology. Besides, one must not forget the terrible  accident at Chernobyl, that is to say a nuclear power plant  built with Russian technology, where the radiation did not  respect sovereign borders, but affected large parts of East and  Central Europe.    [Hochner] Chancellor, Prague's "no" will certainly hamper  Austrian efforts. In the debate in the Austrian Parliament  today, deputies complained to you that the Austrian Federal  Government was not fighting hard enough against the construction  of Temelin, and that, for example, you were not ready to address  the U.S. Congress in connection with that credit guarantee, that  is to say, to go to the United States.    [Vranitzky] Based on what you have just asked me, one must  say that the decision was taken in Prague, or at least people  say that it was taken in Prague. It means that our problem with  the Czech Republic is one issue. Since the Czechs will not  finance this power plant alone, but rely on a major credit from  the American Eximbank, the United States constitutes another  factor.    I do, however, take the accusations that were brought up in  today's debate in Parliament only relatively serious. After  all, had my efforts and the efforts of the Austrian Federal  Government so far not had any effect, then Mr. Klaus would not  have come up with this rather strong statement today.    By way of summing up, I would say that the whole matter can,  of course, be decided by the Czechs as a sovereign people. At  the same time, it is a subject where, in my capacity as Austrian  chancellor, it is my duty not only to respect sovereignty, but  also to take into account the fears and interests of the  Austrian population, and to take them seriously. Therefore, we  will certainly initiate a new round of efforts, and we will  voice our reservations -- our reservations in terms of economic,  ecological, and energy policy -- in the United States, where  this major credit might be granted in the near future; yet, we  will certainly also -- even though, Mr. Klaus has described that  as pure dreams or daydreams -- renew Austria's offers, Austria's  many offers in terms of energy and industrial policy.    I am fully aware that success cannot be achieved overnight  in  this major and most important issue. Yet what is at stake are  vital interests of the Austrian and also the Czech population,  and I will certainly not accept today's declaration as the last  word and lie back and say that nothing can be done.    [Hochner] Chancellor, the Temelin power plant is to be  refitted with U.S. technology, which explains the U.S. credit.  Some power plants in Austria's neighborhood are much more  dangerous, such as the old Russian reactors in Bohunice, or the  old Russian reactors in Paks, near Budapest, not to mention the  15 Chernobyl-type reactors that are still operating. Would the  money for Austria's security and the political impetus not be  better invested if one could shut down these old and notoriously  dangerous power plants with Austrian help?    [Vranitzky] We must not make the mistake now to forget all  the others issues and problems only because we are discussing  Temelin today. Of course, everybody knows that we are engaged  in a very serious debate with the Slovak Government regarding  the Bohunice power plant. And everybody who takes an interest  in such issues also knows that were are negotiating with the  Slovene Government about shutting down the Krsko nuclear power  plant, which is located in an earthquake zone, and that we have  presented our ideas and reservations to all those states, even  though it was not just reservations, but also offers for  developing alternatives and cooperating with us to build  state-of-the-art power plants that are not based on nuclear  fission.    We are always told that, for example, in northern Czechia  there are so many hazardous coal-fired plants, which have led to  chronic lung and eye diseases among children and adults, that  the nuclear power plants are needed to shut down the old  coal-fired power plants.    Moreover, only because the matter was raised today, nobody  must think that this is a new discussion or that we are just  reacting to a single case. No, we are the only government in  all of Europe -- and I am the only government head -- that has  dealt with these dangers. Our efforts are not supported by the  others, as we can see in the countries that operate those power  plants or those who want to build them. However, this does not  stop me from tackling the issue again and again. Even if  somebody describes our efforts as daydreaming or utopian, it was  always through utopian ideas that mankind achieved progress.    [Hochner] Thank you very much, chancellor, and good night.    [Vranitzky] Thank you, good night.</p>

			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> VIDEO FIRM GIVES ELDERLY A LOOK AT OPTIONS  </P> <P> A company has produced four videos to help aging Americans and those who care  for them sort through the bewildering choices about insurance and health care.  </P> <P> Jeanette Vaughan studied health care in college but couldn't think of a way to  market her research.  </P> <P> After seeing "L.A. Law" character Arnold Becker peddle a video of himself  giving advice on divorce, Vaughn plunged in.  </P> <P> She made the video series "All About Aging" and created AgeView Inc., which  distributes the tapes. The series sells for $195 and is marketed to hospitals,  nursing homes and health care agencies. While the public can buy the series,  Vaughan hopes agencies will buy it to show consumers for free.  </P> <P> By 2030, 21% of Americans will be over 65. But Vaughan said most of the country  hasn't considered the idea of an older America.  </P> <P> "The first ones feeling the impact are the women over 40 who are working and  also trying to take care of aging parents," said Vaughan, 28  </P> <P> Among the topics on the tapes are how to obtain Medicare, Medicaid, private  insurance and home health care; the psychosocial views of aging and how to  relate to older relatives; and details on nutrition, safety and equipment use  for elderly patients cared for at home.  </P> <P> Delores Moyer, executive director of Alverno Health Care Corp., based in  Memphis, Tenn., is one of the agencies in 275 U.S. cities that use the tapes.  </P> <P> "We plan to start broadcasting the tapes across our closed-circuit TV network  in the hospitals so patients and families can view the tapes while they are in  the waiting room," said Moyer, whose company operates nine hospitals.  </P> <P> Vaughan said she plans to develop additional tapes. "It's not the answer to  everything, but it points people in the right direction," she said.  </P></p>

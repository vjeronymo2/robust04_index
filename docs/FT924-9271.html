			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Management: From buckyballs to CNN - Christopher Lorenz examines the latest thesis of guru Tom Peters, that all companies must become as fast, flat and flexible as top service organisations IT MAY come as quite a surprise to the employees of several investment banks, a telecommunications utility and an industrial hose maker to learn that their organisations are seen as models which every company should emulate in the future. Television stations, advertising agencies, computer software houses, even management consultancies - all have been lauded by various writers in recent years as thriving on just the sort of informality, reduced hierarchy, rapid responsiveness and project-based organisation which most people consider necessary to competitive survival for almost every industry in the future. But investment banks, telecoms carriers and hose makers? Not to speak of the odd railway company, hand tool manufacturer, and giant engineering group? Absolutely yes, according to Tom Peters, that tub-thumping American business evangelist whose books, In Search of Excellence (1982) and Thriving on Chaos (1987), sold millions and helped mould the attitudes and expectations of untold numbers of managers and other employees in the US and Europe. After an interval of five years, while he has stomped noisily around the seminar and conference circuit in Billy Graham fashion, churning out articles, newsletters, TV programmes and videos, Peters is back in hardcover this month with a real vengeance. His new blockbuster, modestly titled Liberation Management: Necessary Disorganisation For the Nanosecond Nineties*, weighs in at an enormous 834 pages (22 of them merely displaying its contents). In spite of the time it takes to read (as I found to my cost this week), the book could well become as influential in the next couple of years as Excellence and Chaos. As it makes clear via a flood of revealing case studies, Peters considers that the sort of fast, flexible and flat - or flattish - organisation that will prosper in the 1990s and beyond is epitomised to various degrees by Goldman Sachs and other investment banks, by MCI, an ultra-lean telecommunications carrier, and even by Titeflex, a humdrum hose offshoot in Massachusetts of Britain's TI group. Peters also eulogises over revitalised companies such as Union Pacific Railroad, the tools arm of Ingersoll Rand, and ABB, Europe's most-admired engineering multinational. Though several of these are manufacturers, Peters argues that they are just as 'knowledge-based' as the sort of professional service organisations which he posits as models. The service organisations to which he gives particular praise include CNN, Ted Turner's TV network, EDS, the systems integration group founded by Ross Perot, and McKinsey, Peters's former management consultancy employer, as well as a bevy of international advertising, design and 'event' consultancies, notably Britain's Imagination group and part of the Anglo-American IDEO design agency. In one sense, Liberation Management is a comprehensively illustrated, racily written compendium of almost every advanced management practice which has begun to take root in recent years: not just 'delayering', high-involvement and responsibility (or 'empowerment'), learning organisations, networks and so on, but also vertical disintegration and 'outsourcing', total quality, and fast development and production - which Peters says are part of the 'fashionisation' (ephemeral nature) of everything today. The book also examines cross-functional teams, constantly shifting project structures, and even the latest buzz phrase to grip industry, 'process re-engineering'. Underlying everything is Peters' advocacy of three basic principles: breaking organisations into the smallest possible, 'independent' units; giving every employee a businessperson's strong sense of revenue, cost and profit; and getting far more involved than ever before with the customer. But the compilation-like nature of the book does not mean that it lacks originality. Peters not only relates the principles to each other more effectively - and colourfully - than some of their original formulators, he also provides plenty of insights of his own. One is that the degree of control in flat, networked organisations often outstrips that found in traditional bureaucracies. This is because of several factors: project structures tend to focus members on tasks and keep deadline pressure high; team members are motivated not to let down their mates; customers are usually close at hand; and there is constant feedback. Another insight is that the 'pecking order' found in project-based service organisations such as McKinsey and EDS is very different from the hierarchies or layers in a bureaucracy. Broadly speaking, anyone can talk to anyone else and whom you 'report to' depends largely on the situation. A third is that in these days of rampant subcontracting the construction and maintenance of a company's 'core competences' does not necessarily mean assembling a cast of thousands. More controversial, though fundamental to his argument, is Peters' insistence on the 'marketisation' of everything - including head office staff roles. He urges adoption of a rule that every element of an organisation, even staff and other support functions, demonstrates its 'fitness to compete' by selling a substantial share of its products or services to the outside world. 'Allow market forces to blow a gale inside the firm,' declares Peters. Though this may cut many a staff function down to its appropriate size (often zero), it could also tempt a company to lose control over core competences which need to remain proprietary. Similarly, Peters does not come completely to grips with a question that nags leading companies today: how to foster technical and other skills in a 'horizontal' organisation which has abandoned its previous 'functional' specialists, and converted almost entirely to multi-disciplinary project teams. Peters touches on solutions adopted by EDS and others, but does not explore them fully. Such cavils aside, Peters' rampaging new tome will delight more people than it maddens, and instruct almost everyone. Where else, after all, could you find between two covers a discussion of the organisational implications of 'buckyballs' - Buckminster fullerene carbon molecules, named after the geodesic domes of American architect Buckminster Fuller, which are able 'to have the bejesus beaten out of them and bounce back'? At the same time, there is a case study from CNN's front line and a celebration of the work of the market economist Friedrich Hayek. The only pity is that the covers of the book are so damned far apart. * Published Nov 12 in US by Knopf, Dollars 27.50, and on Nov 27 in UK by Macmillan, Pounds 20.</p>

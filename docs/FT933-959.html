			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / As They Say in Europe: Between the Maginot lines - James Morgan takes the measure of Franco-German friendship FRANCO-German relations have been at heart of much of the news this week because of the GATT imbroglio. The alliance is central to almost everything but to see what it really means I took a look at Le Monde and the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, the continent's two most influential papers, to see what France and Germany really mean to each other. How much space do they devote to the other's news and what do they say? As a balancing item there was a similar test of the importance of British items in their output. So I took a period covering 17 issues of each newspaper (do not ask why 17) from the end of August until the middle of September. That period was unusually dull in all three countries and thus made for a fair comparison: anti-Gatt demos were the most newsworthy events to come out of France, the results of the Bundesbank interest rate cut from Germany. In that period, the Frankfurter Allgemeine devoted 366 column centimetres to France. I was not wholly surprised, for reasons I shall explain later, to find that Britain received 541cms, nearly 50 per cent more, in spite of providing even less news. Le Monde in that same period gave Germany 522cms, much of it Gatt-oriented, while Britain received 432. There was a difficulty here because I excluded from the count of Le Monde's cross-Channel coverage a huge tourism feature on Herm in the Channel Islands - 'L'Eden 'made in Britain'.' Had that been included the British score in Le Monde would have reached some 600cms. What the papers write about indicated a lot. Apart from Gatt and German interest rates, the French also follow neo-Nazi matters and the general course of German domestic politics. The FAZ devoted nearly half its coverage of France to Gatt-related topics ('It is scandalous that a single, small interest group in a single country, France, can block a successful outcome to this vital and significant trade round.') The rest was domestic politics and some cultural events. The structure of British news in the two papers was wholly different. In both it is heavily oriented to personalities and traditional institutions. Le Monde was interested in the Edinburgh festival, the former Chancellor Norman Lamont, the novelist A S Byatt, the Trade Union Congress annual conference and mad cow disease. The Germans took the death of the historian E P Thompson very seriously and devoted much space to the BBC, the royal family, the Oxford English dictionary and Harold Pinter's new play. This research confirms me in an impression I have held since I began writing this column. Franco-German friendship is a complete farce and both find the British more interesting than they find each other. Significantly the biggest single item about France in the FAZ during the relevant period was a feature under the sub-heading, 'Is Franco-German friendship at an end?' It was based on a study of a series of books or articles (mainly French) on this very matter. The answer to the question seems to be 'Yes.' A central element in the discussion was an interview the publisher of Der Spiegel, Rudolf Augstein, gave to Le Figaro in August. Some recent commentaries from Augstein had led him to be portrayed across the Rhine as a 'cynical French-hater.' But he told his interviewer, 'We don't accuse you, the French, of the worst things. The worst was done by us. But you have to realise: Even before Hitler there was a hostility between French and German nationalism . . . The opposition to any form of German unity is a component of your history, from Richelieu, to de Gaulle and Mitterand. As Clemenceau significantly put it, 'There've always been too many Germans on this earth.'' The account of Augstein's remarks ended with an attack on the 'Paris intellectuals' and the 'intellectual arrogance of French chauvinism' which were 'among the most unloved (French) export products.' The frankness with which the Germans express themselves about the French has no mirror image. French commentators are so aware of their national dependence on Germany that they tread very carefully. As de Gaulle noted, 'The Germans are with us every minute of every day.' But fortunately I have developed a research tool that gives an infallible guide to underlying French attitudes. Try it yourself on the next Frenchman you meet. You will find the response takes the following form - a sudden intake of breath, a strange pallor suffuses the face, there's some choking, a hand clutches the brow and finally a roar struggles from the confusion. Just say: 'Last summer I was in Nice, walking along the Promenade des Anglais, and I wondered why there wasn't a Promenade des Allemands.'

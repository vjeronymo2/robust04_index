The new agreement will settle the  repayment of short-term loans of 5.6 billion schillings,  including the interest accumulated.    Austria has granted Iran a suspension of payments for  outstanding capital until 1 July 1996. At that point, Iran will  pay back its debts in 16 quarterly installments. As far as the  accumulated debt is concerned, repayment is to be in 16 monthly  installments to start on 30 June 1994. On the basis of the  agreement on Iran's debts, Austrian exporters can now hope for  new Control Bank guarantees. [passage omitted]</p>

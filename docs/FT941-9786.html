			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Regulator move lifts generators Relief lifted the two English power generators above the sliding market trend following the decision by Offer, the industry regulator, not to refer the companies to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. PowerGen shares surged 16 to 541p with 7.8m traded, while National Power put on 14 1/2 to 475 1/2 p with turnover hitting a hefty 21m. The market was almost unanimous in its view that the two companies - which had faced a potentially damaging MMC referral over pool pricing - had come out of the situation well. Analysts said that even the divestments of power stations demanded by the regulator could easily be met from the companies' spare capacity. The pool price cap was also seen as undemanding. With regulatory worries now removed, the shares are forecast to make further gains. Hoare Govett sees a 10 per cent upside in the near term, and further strengthening should the government decide to sell its remaining 40 per cent holdings. Analysts said strong dividend growth over the next three years would also underpin support. The regional electricity companies (Recs) continued weak as investors shied away in response to the view from some in the market that the shares were overbought. There was also talk that one US house had a large seller, prompted by the improving US bond market. Eastern, which retreated 6 to 678p, announced after the market had closed that it had bought a further 750,000 of its shares at prices ranging from 676p to 678p.</p>

			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Paris makes European security ambitions clear: Long-awaited policy goes against the trend among allies towards retrenchment The French government's defence white paper published yesterday is designed to set military policy for 15-20 years. That is perhaps why its 159 pages make no explicit mention of the Bosnian crisis, which Paris obviously hopes will be over long before then. French ambitions to play a leading, even the leading, part in future European security arrangements shine through right from the start. In the foreword, Mr Francois Leotard, defence minister, says 'France must set an example, not in a 19th century-style concert of powers, but in 'Europe'', while Mr Edouard Balladur, prime minister, asks his countrymen to make 'the necessary efforts by which France will play a major role in building a common European defence'. After working wordily through all the uncertainties and risks in post-cold war Europe, the paper concludes that 'France will maintain its effort' well into the next century. That is a radical conclusion, at a time when virtually all its allies are sharply paring their military spending. Yet France has gone 22 years without a defence white paper. So why one now? One reason has to do with domestic politics - Mr Balladur's desire to encroach on President Francois Mitterrand's constitutional prerogative on defence, and in the words of one white paper committee member 'to gather the strategic community around the prime minister' in preparation for Mr Balladur, or another Gaullist like Mr Jacques Chirac, winning next year's presidential election. Mr Mitterrand's role in the paper's preparation has been largely passive. It had to have his approval, but he confined himself mainly to resisting conservative attempts to undermine his moratorium on French nuclear weapon tests, and to make France's nuclear deterrent more 'useable' by calling for design of smaller, cleaner weapons. The other motive is to preserve the famous French consensus on defence in the post-cold war world. The 1972 white paper defined French security in a geographically narrow and nationalist way, to be defended by French forces operating semi-detached from Nato or any other allies. As such, it won remarkable public support. The dangers are now different and more diffuse, but, the paper argues, no less real to France in that they affect the whole European Union into which France is increasingly embedded. It marks Germany and Britain out as key partners. France wants to see Germany throw off its constitutional and political inhibitions to playing a wider military role in Europe, while with Britain 'the level of our co-operation must be significantly raised' because the two countries 'possess relatively important capacity for external action' and 'the will to use it'. But the paper also points to the military and defence potential of Italy, Spain, and Sweden. Far from expressing any animus against Washington or Nato, the paper acknowledges the US as today's 'only military giant' and the alliance as 'the principal organisation of defence'. France will not go back on its 1966 withdrawal from Nato's integrated command, but the paper puts on the record that French defence ministers and chiefs of staff will attend Nato meetings on a case-by-case basis, particularly when peacekeeping operations are involved. The goals which the white paper sets for the Balladur government's forthcoming framework law for military spending over the 1995-2000 period are: Maintaining the nuclear deterrent and filling gaps in conventional forces such as intelligence-gathering, logistics and air transport. The ability to transport some 120,000-130,000 troops and equipment overseas, let its 113-ship navy fall to no fewer than 100, and keep 20 squadrons in its air force. Continue to build its own nuclear weapons and maintain an autonomous capability in such technologies as electronic warfare, stealth weaponry and intelligence. But apart from this, 'there is no area in which France cannot share with other European countries'. This clearly means more arms co-operation with EU partners. The paper foreshadows a joint arms agency with Germany which Paris wants to set up at this summer's Franco-German summit, and again it contains a note of the frustrated suitor with Britain 'whose research and industrial potential is most comparable to ours'.

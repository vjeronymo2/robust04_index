			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Arts: Je regrette 'Piaf' - Theatre I missed the two great musical flops in London: the Norwegian Which Witch at the Piccadilly last year and Eurovision which has just closed after a near-record short run at the Vaudeville. They can hardly have been worse than Piaf, which deserves an even shorter run at the ill-fated Piccadilly. To be accurate, Piaf is not quite a musical. The piece has been around for some years, but not in such a big theatre. Here it is described as 'a musical play', written by Pam Gems, starring Elaine Paige and directed by Sir Peter Hall. Although Piaf may suggest an evening of song and nostalgia for things French, Piaf the woman had an interesting life in interesting times. It is conceivable that there is a good play to be written about her. This is not it. A warning notice in the Piccadilly foyer should have warned us off. The show, it says, contains 'strong language'. Here is a random example (from Alexander Pope) of strong language at its best: 'Yet let me flap this bug with gilded wings, This painted child of dirt that stinks and stings'. There is scarcely a word in it that would offend on its own, yet the overall effect is lethal. To the Peter Hall/Mary Whitehouse school (birds of a feather) 'strong language' means boring, repetitive swearing. How standards have slumped] One four letter word is used, I think, only once. 'Who wants some little cunt looking like a war widow?' says Paige's Piaf, 'when they could have Doris Day?' Unfortunately it misfires. The natural reaction to this production is to think that a preference for Doris Day any time is absolutely right. Swearing is not the only gratuitous element. Piaf may not have been well-educated, yet she must have spoken a more interesting and attractive French argot than the painful English with which she is here afflicted. The point about Piaf was that she could sing and did it in a French that carried around the world, just like Marlene Dietrich in German. It must have been quite difficult being French or German in the early 1940s, and having to live with the consequences afterwards. To reduce Piaf to some kind of inarticulate Lancastrian cockney is a huge disservice to a woman whose songs and spirit we shall continue to admire. This is the very worst kind of patronising English insularity. Other gratuitous acts include sex and violence. At the start there are some silly simulations of the sexual act, which are done much better and more suggestively in the current production of Cabaret at the Donmar Warehouse. Violence is served on a plate. People kick each other in the groin and hit each other on the face at the first opportunity. Some of it may be intended to be funny. Yet you do not need to act out violence in full: only suggest. One sympathises with Ms Paige for wanting to play the part. She is a fine actress who can belt out a song. But someone should have deterred her from this production: Peter Hall, perhaps? Incidentally 'Je ne regrette rien' which finally comes after two and a half hours, is a wonderful number, but if you think about the words only a fool could believe in them. There should be a lot of regrets about this Piaf. Piccadilly Theatre, (071) 867 1044</p>

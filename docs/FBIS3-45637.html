			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Special dispatch:" "Dual Speeding Up and Seeking </F> Stability and Preventing Turmoil -- The Two Points of View in  Response to Reform"]    [Text] Two different voices can be heard when China's  economic reforms in 1994 are about to take a new step: One  favors the "dual speeding up" of reform and development, while  the other urges reform to pay equal attention to stability in  order to prevent social turmoil.    A commentator's article released yesterday by the official  XINHUA News Agency entitled "Parallel Progress in Reform and  Development" stressed that the current reform situation is good,  the objectives are clear and the opportunity is rare, while  admitting that reform is facing a very difficult job. Faced  with the new situation of "dual speeding up" in reform and  development, we should have the following understanding: Learn  how to speed up reforms under a more rapid pace of economic  development and more complicated economic relations. The year  1994 will be the most important for China's reform and economic  development and should be a year of "double harvests"    The article says that the general view inside and outside  China is that China's economy is facing a "dual speeding up"  situation in which China must speed up both reform and  development. If the opportunity offered by the current  stability in the political and economic arenas is well  exploited, then, with painstaking and practical work, China's  economy shall reap a "double harvest" in which both reform and  development will have made great strides.    The article pointed out: To achieve the "double harvest"  objective, we must -- as we surely will if we take a look at  national economic development in 1993 -- understand this:  Reform must create new structures, and development must take a  new path; the two are symbiotic. Only through reform and  creating a new economic structure can the productive forces be  released to any significant extent and can we ensure the  sustained, rapid, and healthy [as published] development of the  national economy. In terms of the economy at the macro level,  GDP grew approximately 13 percent last year, industrial  production grew 19.5 percent, and fixed-asset investment was up  47 percent from the previous year. Even though it was operating  at such a high speed, the economy was not disrupted by any major  problems precisely because reform had been deepened. As a  result, enterprises' production and operating power increased  and combined national power entered a new dimension.    On the other hand, the official JINGJI XINXI BAO [Economic  Information] pointed out in a front-page commentator's article  that the current audacious reforms might result in social  turmoil and sternly warned that the authorities must strike a  balance between reform and stability.    The article says: "Without stability, we have nothing, and  without a stable social environment we can achieve nothing."    The article says: The current reform effort signals that  Beijing is abandoning the socialist planned economy that it has  practised for the last 40 years and represents the deepest probe  yet into the market economy, bringing with it "a redistribution  of power and interests."    The article stressed: "If enterprises pay wages or can only  pay them by raising loans, then there is a problem in the  distribution of interests, which, if handled improperly, may  cause trouble."    The article daringly touched on the "taboo" subject of the  end of the "Deng Xiaoping Era."    The article said that any problems in the process of  transferring power from 89-year old Deng Xiaoping to leaders of  a younger generation will plunge the world's most populous  country into disaster.</p>

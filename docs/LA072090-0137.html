			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VAN GOGH SALE WILL BENEFIT MUSEUM FUNDS  </P> <P> "Vase With Daisies and Poppies," a Vincent van Gogh still life assumed to have  been painted in 1890 during the last weeks of the artist's life, will be  auctioned Nov. 14 by Christie's, New York.  </P> <P> The painting, which depicts poppies, blue cornflowers and daisies casually  displayed is a vase that is sitting on a pinkish-white tabletop, is expected to  bring in $12 million to $16 million, according to Christie's officials.  </P> <P> The painting was a partial gift to the Albright-Knox Art Gallery from George F.  Goodyear in 1962. Sixty-five percent of proceeds from the sale will benefit the  gallery's acquisition fund, and will be used to further strengthen its holdings  in modern and contemporary art.  </P> <P> The museum is especially known for its concentration of modern and postwar art  from all over the world, particularly in contemporary American art.  </P> <P> Of the remaining proceeds, 28% will go to the Buffalo Museum of Science and 7%  will go to the University at Buffalo Foundation.  </P> <P> The work may have been painted at the home of the artist's patron, Dr. Gachet,  Christie's officials said.  </P> <P> A letter from Van Gogh to his brother Theo, dated June 17, 1990, described two  studies of wildflowers. Another letter, dated June 3 of the same year, stated  that Gachet's home was "full like an antique dealer's" and that "there is  always something for arranging flowers in or for a still life."  </P> <P> Art experts said it is possible that "Vase With Daisies and Poppies" was  painted at Gachet's house, with flowers from his garden arranged in a vase  owned by the doctor.

			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Consumer confidence at four-year high CONSUMER confidence in the third quarter was at its highest level for more than four years, according to a survey published yesterday which suggests the recovery is becoming better established. The rise in consumer spending, which has been a big factor behind the past year's upturn, is 'increasingly robust' with southern England leading the way, says the report by Business Strategies, an economic consultancy, and the Gallup market research group. Low interest rates, reduced unemployment and signs of a better economic climate are boosting people's willingness to spend, apparently offsetting gloomy news elsewhere in the economy. Negative factors are that many people are worried about the Pounds 6.8bn of higher taxes announced for the next financial year. Also, more individuals than earlier in the year expect inflationary pressures to rise over the next few months. The index of consumer confidence based on answers to questions put to 6,000 people throughout Britain gave a figure of 16 in the third quarter of this year, up from 11 in the second quarter and 4 in the first quarter. The last time it was higher was in the first three months of 1989. Optimism about the economic climate is highest in south-east England - in spite of this region having suffered particularly badly during the recession in terms of unemployment and a fall in house prices. According to estimates by Business Strategies, consumer spending in south-east England outside London increased by 1.9 per cent in the year to the third quarter, higher than the figure for Britain as a whole of 1.6 per cent. Other regions with particularly high rises in consumer spending over this period were south-west England, East Anglia and north-west England. These saw increases of 2.8 per cent, 2 per cent and 1.9 per cent respectively. Mr David Fell, a director of Business Strategies, said all regions were sharing in the general rise in consumer confidence. However, optimism could still slip back, for example in the event of the government announcing a further large increase in taxation for 1994-95 in next month's Budget.</p>

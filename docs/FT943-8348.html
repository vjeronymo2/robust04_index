			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / (CORRECTED) Letters to the Editor: Holding on to the equity futures dream Correction (published 18th August 1994) appended to this article. Sir, Joel Kibazo's article ('Equity futures trading dreams begin to fade', August 4) compares certain average turnover figures for Liffe with the lack of trades on our exchange during July. In fact, July was a bad month for both exchanges. Over the six-month life of these contracts, volumes have been very low. Liffe has traded an average of only 3,500 per month while the OMLX exchange (a screen-based securities and derivatives exchange, launched in February in Sweden) average has been 1,500 per month. But in July trading on both our exchange and Liffe began to seriously dry up. We traded no contracts at all, while Liffe traded 788. This downward trend has continued during August. The plain fact is that the contract is succeeding on neither Liffe nor the OMLX exchange. The criticisms levelled at the OMLX exchange in the article seriously over-simplify the situation. I would be interested to know how many of the market participants quoted can claim to be satisfied with the way in which the UK equity derivative market is performing today. It is, in fact, one of the poorer performing equity derivative markets in Europe. Our decision to enter this market was conditioned by the fact that our existing product range forms a highly liquid and very efficient market. For instance, the most heavily traded stock option in London is Astra, traded on our exchange, rather than any UK stock option traded on Liffe. We felt that we could bring these same efficiencies and liquidity to the under-performing UK equity derivative market. The fact that we have not yet done so with the FT-SE Mid 250 Index may be due rather less to the factors quoted in Mr Kibazo's article than to the original decision by the London Stock Exchange to grant two licences. The contract may have stood a better chance of succeeding if only one exchange had traded it from the start. But we, no more than Liffe, could avoid picking up the gauntlet thrown down by the LSE. The problem we all now face is to find a way of reviving this contract and making it the success it deserves to be. We intend to pursue this objective, together with Liffe and the LSE, in the weeks to come. Lynton Jones, chief executive, OMLX, 107 Cannon Street, London, EC4N 5AD CORRECTION The OMLX exchange was founded in London in 1989, not as was incorrectly stated owing to an editing error in yesterday's letter from Mr Lynton Jones.</p>

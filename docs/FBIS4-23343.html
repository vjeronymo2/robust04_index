			<p>BFN     [Text] Last week's Executive Committee meeting of the HNP  [Reformed National Party] was, in terms of numbers and  enthusiasm, the most successful in years. The audience filled  the Premos Hall.    Leader Jaap Marais's speech, in which he summed up the  current situation in the country and showed the way ahead, was  one of his most inspiring ever, and it put the stamp on this  most historic moment in the history of the Afrikaner nation  [volk]. It proved there was no dejection among the  principle-bound right-wingers -- only determination and an  eagerness to accept the struggle that lies ahead and to take the  bull by the horns.    Mr. Marais pointed out that the unitary idea being advocated  in newspapers and speeches were hollow slogans without any real  content. The whole idea of a lot of loose, totally different  groupings of people of all races embraced in a declaration of  human rights has only one aim, and that is to establish a new  basis for American imperialism. The volk's unity must be broken  down and the people must be involved in human rights as  individuals -- that is the American plan being used to get at  the Afrikaner nation and its political power. That is the  contemporary form of American imperialism.    We are not dealing simply with a black government, nor even  a  black communist government, but with an attempt to complete the  British-American plan of the last century to eliminate the  Afrikaner nation from the African political scenery.    In 1948, the same politics suffered its greatest setback.  Malan, Strydom, and especially Verwoerd opposed the  British-American plan and foiled it for half a century. Now  that Verwoerd has been murdered, they have again come to the top  and they want to complete their efforts by transforming southern  Africa into one big communist state. Back in 1976, Kissinger  publicly said he wanted one black state in this part of the  world.    The negotiation process has been the lifeblood of the  terrorists' victory. It was an all-embracing British-American  imperialist success -- not the birth of a new nation, which was  a nonsensical theme of the [inaugural] celebrations.    A nation is not built by a constitution; neither does it get  destroyed by one, as the plan seems to be. Nations are  indestructible, Mr. Marais said.    The state which the British and Americans have rigged up  will  for many years to come be a totally unstable political product.  Should there arise serious differences of opinion in Parliament  -- of that everyone can be sure of -- the ANC will simply fall  back on a referendum and thereafter call another election. It  will be a product of black Africa. Nowhere in Africa have the  blacks built anything worthwhile -- nothing that has lasted.  The bespectacled blacks in expensive clothes that one sees on  television are the same people living elsewhere in Africa. It  will not be different here than anywhere in Africa, Mr. Marais  said.    South Africa will only get from them an unstable state,  characteristic of them. The enmity between Zulus and Xhosas is  built in; it will eventually have to be resolved the African  way. The threat to the future of the whites; the threat to  Afrikaner nationhood is built in. The prospect of an attempt at  a second, open communist revolution is built in.    The Afrikaner sees all these things. He acknowledges the  situation for what it is, but the Afrikaner will not let the  matter rest there. He acknowledges it in a spirit of  resistance, of stubbornness, just like the Boer generals in  1902, Mr. Marais said -- to lengthy applause.</p>

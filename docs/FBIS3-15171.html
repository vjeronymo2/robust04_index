While it is unknown what circle of persons is involved  in this process, it may prove rather wide.    Your SEGODNYA correspondent has been told by Aleksandr  Mikhaylov, chief of the Federal Counterintelligence Service  [FCS] public relations center, that a high-ranking foreign  intelligence agent was detained on 15 January. According to Mr.  Mikhaylov, the detainee had been recruited by representatives of  the English special service. Searches have turned up in his  possession devices for cryptography and photographing of  documents, instructions for dead drops in Moscow, and other  things used by spies. The newspaper's office has managed to  find out that the person involved is a senior official of the  SMM (Spetsialnoye Mashinostroyeniye i Metallurgiya) [Special  Machine-Building and Metallurgy] joint-stock company created on  the basis of enterprises of the former USSR Oboronprom [defense  industry] in charge of the completion of state programs in the  area of armored equipment and artillery systems. The level of  this position can be illustrated by the fact that he had the  possibility of direct access to representatives of legal  operatives of the English intelligence service under embassy  "cover." The detained man is charged with passing to a foreign  special service the most classified information on the newest  systems of armaments and Russia's general defense potential. On  25 February, he was officially charged under Article 64, item  "a" (high treason in the form of spying), and he fully admitted  his guilt.    The information the newspaper's office received about  arrests  in the FCS itself and the Federal Agency for Government  Communications and Information (FAGCI) have still not been  officially confirmed. Mr. Mikhaylov, too, "does not confirm"  (neither does he deny) the fact of a FCS officer's having been  arrested. FAGCI spokesman Vyacheslav Tupitsyn told your  SEGODNYA correspondent that there had been no arrests in his  agency of officers suspected of the commission of crimes  stipulated by articles of the "special section" of Russia's  Criminal Code.</p>

			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Bath: a beautiful city of burglars and beggars TRAFFIC POLLUTION, aggressive beggars, drunken gangs, ram raiders, empty shops . . . this could be one of Britain's more deprived urban areas. But it is Bath, a genteel Georgian city and world heritage site attracting 2m visitors a year, as depicted in a 'city centre audit'. The audit is by Ms Kimberly Paumier, appointed manager of the city centre in April to help revitalise it. An American, she is described by Bath's chief executive, Mr Clive Abbott, as someone who is 'able to take a fresh and critical view'. Ms Paumier's first report, which went to Bath council's environment committee yesterday, says that 'Bath is a beautiful city, gifted with resources and assets not found in most UK cities'. It also praises the Roman and Georgian architecture, the quality of the shops and culture - there are 17 museums. However, the report also points to poor road connections and congested streets, high levels of pollution and a scruffy railway station. Although the city is described as one of Britain's top retail locations, Ms Paumier says a perception that rates and rents are higher than elsewhere has increased the number of vacant shops. For retailers who remain in business, ram-raiding is a significant problem and the council is to consider closed-circuit television. The report highlights concern over drunks and travellers causing tension and animosity. Ms Paumier welcomes busking and street theatre as assets for Bath, but 'the amount of aggressive begging is a growing threat', she says. Ms Paumier adds: 'Bath after dark can sometimes be a threatening place' with large groups of 'often drunk or disruptive' youths. The police, 'tend to stay at a distance for fear that they might incite further aggression'. Among Ms Paumier's proposals are a leisure and health spa to encourage overnight stays by visitors, more conference facilities and greater use of the river Avon.</p>

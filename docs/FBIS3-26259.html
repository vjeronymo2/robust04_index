			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Guangzhou, 17 Jan (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) --  According to statistics issued by the Guangzhou City industrial  and commercial administration, more than 2,300 cases of fake and  imitation goods -- involving a total value of 8.78 million yuan  or more -- were reported, investigated, and handled in the city  last year. The confiscated fake and imitation goods fall into  more than 40 categories.    These fake and imitation goods seized in Guangzhou range  from  capital goods to daily necessities and from general commodities  to high-class consumer goods. Large quantities of commodities  were confiscated last year, including color television sets,  video recorders, lubricant, toiletry soaps, cement, agricultural  chemicals, human leukocyte interferon [ren bai xi bao gan rao su  0086 4101 4798 5165 1626 2371 4790], garments, cigarettes,  alcoholic drinks, low-voltage electric appliances, and cosmetics.    Reports have indicated that fake and imitation goods  manufacturers in Guangzhou are now expanding from small  partnerships into collectively owned enterprises. In some  areas, they have even been operating on a fairly large scale.  They mostly fabricate goods to imitate quality foreign and  local brand-name products, and their skill in copying is so  perfect that the imitation goods can hardly be distinguished  from the genuine ones.    Last year, Guangzhou City's industrial and commercial  administration focused its attention on fighting the illegal  manufacture and sale of fake and imitation goods. With clues  reported by local residents, the industrial and commercial  administrative bureau of Baiyun district discovered and searched  an illegal processing workshop producing fake high-grade  lubricant bearing the "Mobil" brand name and confiscated more  than 1,900 cans of the lubricant as well as some empty cartons  and cans.</p>

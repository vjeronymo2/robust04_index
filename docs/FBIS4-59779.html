			<p>BFN     [Text] There were demonstrations last night in the wake of  the terrorist attack in Hebron and in protest against the  government's peace policy. In Jerusalem's Paris Square opposite  the prime minister's residence, five demonstrators were arrested  by police when they tried to break through barricades.    On the Jerusalem-Jericho road, police dispersed  demonstrators  from the nearby settlement of Kfar Adumim, home of the Hebron  attack victims. According to Qol Yisra'el's reporter on the  scene, the demonstrators not only blocked the highway, but  violently confronted Arab drivers.</p>

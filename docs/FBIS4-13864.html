			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 23 Apr (MENA)--Dr. Usamah al-Baz, first  Foreign Ministry under secretary and director of the President's  Office for Political Affairs, met with Dr. Nabil Sha'th, adviser  to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and head of the  Palestinian delegation to the negotiations with Israel. They  discussed the negotiations and the extent of progress made. The  Palestinian-Israeli talks will resume in Cairo tomorrow morning.    Following the meeting, Dr. al-Baz expressed hope that the  Palestinians and Israelis would do their best to complete  discussion of the pending issues during the round of talks that  will begin Sunday so that the implementation of the Declaration  of Principles can start and the Palestinian people can feel the  big change that will take place when a new phase of good  relations between the Palestinian and Israeli peoples begins.    He said the positions of the two sides are quite close,  which  makes it possible for the talks to have a "positive and happy  ending."</p>

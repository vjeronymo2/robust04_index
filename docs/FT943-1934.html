			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Fayeds fail to clear names over DTI report: European rights court rejects challenge to Harrods takeover allegations The Fayed brothers failed yesterday in a final bid to clear their names over their 1985 takeover of the House of Fraser stores group, which included Harrods. Claims that their human rights had been violated by the system of company investigations in the UK were rejected by the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. Mr Mohamed, Mr Ali and Mr Salah al-Fayed had challenged a Department of Trade and Industry report that branded their conduct during the takeover battle as dishonest. They said they had been denied the right to contest the report's damning conclusions. Mr Mohamed al-Fayed, chairman of Harrods, remained adamant last night that the UK practice of company investigations was 'dictatorial and unacceptable'. He said: 'I'm disappointed, but this is the way you show people that you don't just sit and take insults just like that. If you can't get justice in this country, you have to go somewhere.' The government welcomed the decision. The DTI said it was glad the court had ruled that there had been no violation of the European Convention on Human Rights. Yesterday's judgment added a final footnote to the long-running dispute between the Fayeds and Lonrho, the international trading conglomerate defeated by the brothers in its own attempt to take over House of Fraser in 1985. Lonrho declined to comment on the Strasbourg decision. Mr Colin Matthews, group chief accountant, said Mr Tiny Rowland, Lonrho joint chairman, and Mr Fayed had settled their dispute at the end of last year and the matter was history. The DTI inspectors' report on the House of Fraser takeover, published in March 1990, concluded that the Fayeds had dishonestly misrepresented their origins, their wealth, their business interests and their resources prior to the takeover. They had also knowingly submitted false evidence to the DTI inspectors during their investigation. The Fayeds have steadfastly disputed the conclusions. The brothers claimed that in the eyes of the world the report had the force of a judgment delivered after a trial at which they had been convicted. But criminal charges were never brought. The government had not even sought to have them disqualified as company directors. The denial of effective access to an English court to defend their right to honour and reputation and the denial of effective domestic remedies to challenge the DTI inspectors' findings amounted to a breach of the convention, they argued. The Strasbourg judges rejected their claim. The court said the company investigations system and the freedom of reporting enjoyed by inspectors were both in the public interest. The system also contained safeguards to ensure that the procedure was fair and the findings of fact were reliable. The brothers had been given every opportunity to respond to the allegations made against them. Lord Lester, QC, the Fayeds' counsel, said the court had given a 'restrictive and technical interpretation' of the convention's 'due process', or fair trial, provision. The judgment underlined the need for a Bill of Rights in the UK with a due process clause in it, he said. The judgment came just two days after the European Commission of Human Rights, which takes a preliminary look at claims, decided that Mr Ernest Saunders, the former Guinness chairman who was jailed for his part in the company's takeover of Distillers, had been denied a fair trial.

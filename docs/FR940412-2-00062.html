National states that the total volumes to be delivered is estimated to be 910 Mcf annually. National indicates that this will have a minimal impact on its peak day and annual deliveries. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> National states that an emergency tap was installed at the proposed location on February 4, 1994, because seven residential customers of Distribution were without gas. National explains that the seven customers were out of gas due to frozen wells and related facilities which previously provided for their needs. On March 24, 1994, Distribution filed for waiver of the initial time limitation because the wells have not returned to sufficient production. National further states that it is now seeking authorization under its blanket certificate to assure continuation of service beyond the expiration of the current emergency authorization. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any person or the Commission's staff may, within 45 days after issuance of the instant notice by the Commission, file pursuant to rule 214 of the Commission's Procedural Rules (18 CFR 385.214) a motion to intervene or notice of intervention and pursuant to &sect;157.205 of the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205) a protest to the request. If no protest is filed within the time allowed therefor, the proposed activity shall be deemed to be authorized effective the day after the time allowed for filing a protest. If a protest is filed and not withdrawn within 30 days after the time allowed for filing a protest, the instant request shall be treated as an application for authorization pursuant to section 7 of the Natural Gas Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Lois D.

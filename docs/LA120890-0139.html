			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE;  </P> <P> CITY MAY BUY GROVES TO PRESERVE THEM  </P> <P> The city may buy orange groves worth about $4 million in an area slated for  development as a way to preserve open space and keep a link to Irvine's  agricultural past, officials said.  </P> <P> The 16-acre, L-shaped area along Jeffrey Road south of the Santa Ana Freeway  could be leased to a farmer to pay for its upkeep and perhaps become part of a  park as "a reminder of Irvine past," said Robert C. Johnson, the city's  director of community development.  </P> <P> The plan to buy the orange trees from the Irvine Co. has been discussed for  about a year. The company's orange groves are in an area slated for future  industrial and commercial development.  </P> <P> In November, 1989, the City Council asked its planning staff to talk with the  Irvine Co. about buying a portion of the orange groves along Jeffrey Road and  adjacent to the freeway. The city would purchase them using $4 million  allocated to Irvine by a recent state ballot proposition to preserve open  space.  </P> <P> Within the next few months, the city and Irvine Co. will jointly hire an  appraiser to place a value on the land, Johnson said.  </P> <P> The Irvine Co. hasn't committed to selling the land but is willing to talk with  the city in order to see orange trees preserved, company spokeswoman Dawn  McCormick said Friday.

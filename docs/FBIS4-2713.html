			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Guan Xiangdong (7070 0686 2639)] </F>   [Text] Haikou, 11 Apr (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- According  to a conference of Hainan taxation bureau chiefs held a few days  ago, the new taxation system, which converges with Hainan's  preferential policies, is operating smoothly in Hainan. While  implementing the new taxation system, the taxation policies for  the Hainan Special Economic Zone [SEZ] will remain unchanged.    When the new taxation system converges with Hainan's  preferential policies, the 15 percent income tax for enterprises  and other policies concerning the term of exemption will  continue to be effective. The specific contents of the term of  exemption include:    First, a 15 percent tax rate will be levied on the income  from the production and operation of enterprises run by foreign  and interior province investors in Hainan. They are exempted  from local income taxes.    Second, preferential treatment will be given to income taxes  delivered by enterprises in light of different trades, term of  operation, and investment amount. For example, enterprises  engaged in harbor, port, airport, highway, railway, power  station, coal mine, water conservancy, and agricultural  development, whose term of operation exceeds 15 years, may be  exempted from income taxes for five years from the year they  start making a profit, and their income taxes will be reduced by  50 percent from the sixth to the tenth year. Enterprises  engaged in industrial, transportation, and other productive  trades, whose term of operation exceeds 10 years, may be  exempted from income taxes for two years from the year they  start making a profit, and their income taxes shall be reduced  by 50 percent from the third to the fifth year. Income taxes of  the enterprises regarded by the Hainan Government as advanced  technological enterprises shall be reduced by 50 percent from  the sixth to the eighth year. When the period of aforementioned  tax exemption expires for enterprises engaged in industrial and  agricultural production, an enterprise must pay income tax of 10  percent if its exports exceed 70 percent of its output value in  the year. Enterprises engaged in service and catering trades  whose total investment exceeds $5 million, or 20 million yuan,  and whose term of operation exceeds 10 years, shall be exempted  from income taxes for one year from the year they start making a  profit; their income taxes shall be reduced by 50 percent for  the second and third year. Foreign-funded banks, Sino-foreign  banks, and other foreign-funded financial organizations may  enjoy the preferential treatment of exemption and reduction in  income taxes. More preferential policies shall be granted to  the use of foreign capital in developing basic facilities and  productive enterprises in Tongshi and the nationality autonomous  counties.    Third, foreign-funded enterprises which use their profits  made in Hainan to reinvest in running enterprises in Chinese  territory or expand production for a term of not less than 5  years may get a refund of 40 percent of the income tax paid for  reinvestment. If the reinvestment is made in Hainan's  infrastructure, agricultural development, and exports or if the  enterprises are regarded by the Hainan Provincial Government as  advanced technological enterprises, they will receive all the  income taxes paid for reinvestment. If the enterprises withdraw  within five years, they must pay the aforementioned refunded  income taxes.    Fourth, dividends, interests, rent, franchise royalty, and  other incomes gained by investors outside the territory which  have no offices in Hainan may be exempted from income taxes.    Moreover, there are preferential treatment for exchange  taxes  in the following three aspects:    First, the consumption and value-added taxes in the  production process imposed on the goods produced and marketed on  the island, except cigarette, alcohol, sugar, and mineral oil,  will be reduced by 50 percent. The consumption and value-added  taxes in the production process on other goods will be exempted.    Second, the dutiable consumer goods exported directly by the  production enterprises in Hainan or the dutiable consumer goods  exported through the foreign trade enterprises shall be exempted  from consumer taxes in the production process. There will be no  value-added tax on direct export goods. An application can be  filed to the taxation organs for tax reimbursement on imported  items. Value-added and consumer taxes will be levied on products  sold to foreign trade enterprises for exports. After the goods  are exported, the foreign trade enterprises may apply to the  taxation organs for tax reimbursements in light of relevant  provisions.    Third, income of foreign-funded banks and Sino-foreign banks  (insurance companies) in the Hainan SEZ shall be exempted from  business taxes for 5 years, beginning from the date of their  operation. When the exemption period expires, the business tax  imposed on these banks shall be reduced by 3 percent.</p>

			<p><P> June 7, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> UNFAIR COMPETITION SEEN;  </P> <P> CANADA BREWERS FOAM OVER LOW U.S. PRICES  </P> <P> Canadian brewers, worried that cheaper U.S. beer is grabbing a growing share of  a stagnating market, have accused some U.S. rivals of dumping and are pushing  officials to boost prices of the competing brands.  </P> <P> "They are dumping and selling in Canada at a price less than their home  market," said Howard Collins, a spokesman for the Brewers Assn. of Canada.  </P> <P> But the brewers are unwilling to lodge an official complaint with the Canadian  government, even though they say hundreds of jobs are threatened.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Dealing With Liquor Boards  </P> <P> The big three -- Molson Breweries of Canada Ltd., Carling O'Keefe Breweries of  Canada Ltd. and Labatt Brewing Co Ltd. -- prefer to work out a deal with the  liquor boards that distribute beer in most provinces.  </P> <P> "We want them (the U.S. brewers) to pay more taxes or pay the full cost of  distribution," Collins said.  </P> <P> Industry analysts said dumping is a difficult case to prove legally, which is  why the brewers are lobbying for higher markups and taxes.  </P> <P> In Ontario, the province where U.S. beer's surge is rising fastest, sales  jumped to $17.3 million ($14.5 million U.S. dollars) in February, 1989, from  $3.2 million ($2.5 million) a year earlier, according to Liquor Control Board  of Ontario figures.  </P> <P> U.S.-brewed beer's share of the $2.5-billion ($2.1-billion) Canadian market  rose to 2.6% in 1988 from 2.1% in 1987, according to the brewers' group.  </P> <P> By comparison, Labatt has a market share of just over 40%, Molson has about  one-third and Carling, which is owned by Elders IXL Ltd. of Australia, has  around 20%. If Molson and Carling receive government approval for a merger  proposal made earlier this year, the combined firm will probably lead the  industry.  </P> <P> Analysts and industry officials say that even though the U.S. brewers have only  a tiny market share in contrast with the Canadians, the sudden growth could  prove a threat because the beer market is flat. Sales are not rising anymore,  they said, because of consumers' growing focus on health.  </P> <P> "It doesn't pose much of a problem for the industry now, but these things have  a habit of growing," said Martin Kaufman, of Nesbitt Thomson Deacon Inc.  </P> <P> But U.S. beer producers, who also face growing health concerns, do not want to  give up their share of the Canadian market. Officials at two of the firms  singled out by the Canadian brewers -- G. Heileman Brewing Co., which makes  Lone Star, and Stroh Brewery Co., which manufactures Old Milwaukee -- were  quick to deny the dumping charges.  </P> <P> A statement by Simon Marshall, director of international sales and marketing  for Stroh, called the dumping charges "completely without foundation" and said  consumers were drinking Old Milwaukee because of its high quality and good  value.  </P> <P> Old Milwaukee and Lone Star sell for about $4.50 ($3.65) for a six-pack in  Ontario, which is $2 ($1.65) less than most Canadian-brewed beers. Those  include U.S. brand-name beers made in Canada under contract. Molson makes  Coors, Labatt manufactures Budweiser and Carling produces Miller.  </P> <P> Canadian brewers say they cannot produce beer as cheaply because they are not  as large as the U.S. companies, who have greater economies of scale. Canadian  provincial laws require production of beer in the province where it is sold.  </P> <P> Because of this, the politically powerful Canadian brewers were able to lobby  successfully to have beer exempted from the free trade agreement between Canada  and the United States, which took effect Jan. 1.  </P></p>

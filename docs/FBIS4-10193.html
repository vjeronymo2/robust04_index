			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Reporters were highly  interested in the current leadership of Cuba and the future  successor to Cuban President Fidel Castro. In response to this,  Robaina stated that for a long time, every Cuban generation has  participated in the People's Government, adding: We do not need  to worry about a replacement for Fidel because Fidel, together  with the Cuban people, the youth, and the not so young, is part  of a project of development and change.    Other issues, like The Nation and the Emigre Community  conference; the new impetus of Cuba's foreign policy; and  Havana's possibilities for paying its debt to Montevideo were  discussed by Robaina at this news conference, which concluded  just minutes ago.</p>

			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / UK Company News: Bell Canada offshoot to take control of ELT BCE TELECOM International is to take a controlling interest in East London Telecommunications which owns six cable television franchises in the London area covering about 630,000 homes. The deal will make BCE, a subsidiary of Bell Canada, a significant force in the UK cable television industry. The Canadian company has reached agreement to buy PacTel Cable's 45 per cent investment in ELT, and is also buying part of the stake of Jones UK, the other current main shareholder in ELT. Together the two purchases will give BCE a controlling interest although Jones will continue as manager of cable TV operations. PacTel Cable, a subsidiary of Pacific Telesis of the US, has long made it clear that it wanted to sell its minority stake in ELT and concentrate on the 1m homes in the UK in cable franchises it wholly owns. The ELT franchises range from the London boroughs of Newham and Tower Hamlets to Barking, Waltham Forest and Epping. Progress, however, has been slow and BCE estimates that Pounds 200m in capital expenditure is needed over the next five years to fully develop the business. Bell Canada will obviously be interested in expanding the telecommunications and data services of ELT. The latest figures from the Independent Television Commission show that in the year from January 1991 the number of telephone lines installed by cable TV contractors in the UK increased from 2,224 to 21,225.</p>

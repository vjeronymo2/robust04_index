			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Brazil presses on with sell-off The Brazilian government sold 70 per cent of the shares on offer in the sell-off of the Companhia Siderurgica Nacional (CSN), the steel company, on Friday. The remaining 30 per cent are scheduled to be sold today, writes Bill Hinchberger in Sao Paulo. President Itamar Franco held firm in his determination to sell the company, despite protests by nationalists and law suits filed by opponents. Administration officials worked intensively on Friday to overturn several court orders suspending the auction, which was delayed by three hours.</p>

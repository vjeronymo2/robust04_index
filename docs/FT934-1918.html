			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / Daimler plans roadshow for US stock offering: Innovations at Germany's largest industrial group Daimler-Benz is planning a 10-city marketing roadshow in the US early next year to promote the planned public offering in New York of 3.2 per cent of the group's stock, currently owned by Deutsche Bank. Mr Gerhard Liener, group finance director, said the aim was to increase the volume of trade in Daimler shares on the in New York Stock Exchange. The secondary offering of 15m American depositary shares (ADSs), each representing one tenth of an ordinary Daimler share, with a current market value of more than DM1bn, would come by early February. The underwriters also have an option to acquire up to 2.25m extra ADSs, representing a further 225,000 ordinary shares, to cover over-allotments. The offering is believed to be the second biggest by a European company in the US, after British Telecom. The move will cut Deutsche Bank's holding in Daimler to slightly under 25 per cent. Although speculation persists that further reductions in the bank's holding are likely, Mr Liener said the close ties between the two companies would continue. Deutsche's offering is part of a growing trend among German banks to liberate capital for more fruitful deployment in the mainstream banking business. The sale of Daimler shares follows the group's listing on the NYSE on October 5, which made it the first German company to be traded there. The timing of the new offering is linked to the conversion, expected to be approved this week, of shares in MAH into ordinary Daimler stock. MAH is a holding company, set up at Daimler's initiative in the 1970s to hold 25 per cent of the group's stock and protect it from takeover. In a statement agreed with Deutsche, Mr Liener said the bank did not wish to be the only stockholder retaining a blocking minority. 'We intend to offer a good third of the share capital made available to private stockholders,' he said. Lex, Page 20; BAe, Page 24</p>

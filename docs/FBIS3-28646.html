			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The government will promote an envisioned  medium-sized (50 to 100 seat) commuter aircraft development  program through international cooperation rather than with  Korean firms alone.    The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE) said  yesterday such actors as the technological level of the domestic  aerospace industry and access to the world market after  development have led it to opt for international cooperation  instead of a purely Korean effort. But when international  cooperation is hard to come by, the ministry said, Korean firms  will have to work on their own after introducing foreign  technology.    The ministry also said the prototype aircraft will be  developed by a consortium comprising all three Korean aircraft  assemblers--Samsung Aerospace Industries, Daewoo Heavy  Industries and Korean Air. This decision goes against Samsung's  insistence that the development program be carried out by one  single prime contractor to ensure control of the whole program.    The consortium, however, will be led by one company. To  select it, the ministry will soon form a committee, which will  map out criteria for the leading firm and send request for  proposals (RFP) to the three candidates.    The ministry's decision, following advice by the Korea  Aerospace Research Institute (KARI), has put the three firms in  fierce competition to gain designation as the leading company.  The final selection is expected to be made in May this year.    The consortium, after being formed, will seek participation  from advanced foreign companies into the Korean commuter  development program.    The ministry will leave it to the consortium to decide on  how  large the envisaged aircraft should be. Originally, it planned  to develop a 50-seat commuter craft, but Daewoo and KAL opposed  the idea on the grounds that a 50-seat aircraft would not be  profitable.    The government plans to complete the development program by  1998 at an estimated cost of 279 billion won (about $344  million). Over half of the cost will be shouldered by the  government.    The development program will be promoted in four  divisions--overall management, aircraft development, design  verification and certification. Except for the actual  development work, other jobs will be handled by relevant  professional research organizations, the ministry said.    The ministry intends to finalize its development plan in  March after acquiring endorsement from the deliberation  committee on aerospace industry development.    The medium-sized commuter development program is part of the  government efforts to foster the domestic aerospace industry.  By developing an exportable commuter, it intends to secure core  aircraft design and testing technology, put the industry on a  solid growth path and reduce deficits in the nation's aircraft  manufacturers.    According to a report by KARI, the international  medium-sized  commuter industry, unlike the large aircraft (over 100 seats)  industry, is not dominated by an oligopoly, implying that entry  by Korea will not be difficult.    The institute forecast that the break-even point for Korea  will be about 180 aircraft. The ministry expects that by 2010,  Korea will have a domestic demand of 170 medium-sized commuters.  by then, it hopes,the domestic aerospace industry will also be  able to export 50 to 100 commuter aircraft.</p>

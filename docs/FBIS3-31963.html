			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President-elect Eduardo Frei today appointed 23 of  the 29 under secretaries of the administration that will take  over on 11 March. He explained that he will appoint the  remaining six in the near future: the education under secretary  and the five under secretaries of the Defense Ministry.    Last night, after attending a mass that marked the 12th  anniversary of his father Eduardo Frei Montalva's death,  President-elect Eduardo Frei announced that he would release the  list of under secretaries the next day. This decision -- which  caught everyone by surprise because the president-elect himself  had indicated earlier that the appointments would be postponed  -- had journalists waiting for the announcement at Frei's  offices on Hindenburg Street since early morning on 22 January.  Just as he had done with the cabinet, the president-elect did  not appoint all the under secretaries at once, leaving six  appointments for later.    [Begin Frei recording] Since I believe in teamwork I also  believe that the respective ministers and under secretaries  should be properly attuned to each other and trust each other  because they will be working together day in, day out. Thus, I  will appoint the education under secretary later and the same  goes for the under secretaries of the Defense Ministry. [end  recording]    Herewith the list of officials who will hold the rank of  under secretary under the new administration:    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Belisario Velasco                     |Interior                              |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Jorge Rodriguez                       |Regional development                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Jose Miguel Insulza                   |Foreign relations                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Carlos Mladinic                       |Economy                               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Patricio Bernal                       |Fishing                               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Manuel Marfan                         |Finance                               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Eduardo Jara                          |Justice                               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |German Quintana                       |Public works                          |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Alejandro Gutierrez                   |Agriculture                           |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Sergio Vergara                        |National resources                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Guillermo Perez                       |Labor                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Patricio Tombolini                    |Social welfare                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Fernando Munoz                        |Health                                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Sergio Hernandez                      |Mining                                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Sergio Galilea                        |Housing                               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |(Claudio Homan)                       |Transport                             |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Jorge Rosembluth                      |Telecommunications                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Edgardo Riveros                       |Under secretary general of governent  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Angel Flisfisch                       |Under secretary general of the presid-|  |                                      |ency                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Pedro Goic                            |Planning and coordination             |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Eduardo Bitran                        |Production Development Corporation ge-|  |                                      |neral manager                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Maria Isabel Gonzalez                 |National Energy Commission chairwoman |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Paulina Veloso                        |National Woman's Secretariat          |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      The president-elect stated that there has been no pressure  whatsoever behind these appointments.    [Begin Frei recording] I would like to say once again that I  have not been pressured to make any of these appointments.  Undoubtedly, the various political parties have conveyed their  suggestions and I have talked to the ministers, but everybody  left me free to make the appointments. As I have explained, the  delay -- which I believe to be perfectly normal given the fact  that I was operated on just a week ago -- in making these  appointments gave me the chance to talk to all of them and make  sure that they will do their jobs independently.

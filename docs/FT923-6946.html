			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Dollar falls near to all-time low against D-Mark: Pound slides to lowest level since ERM entry as German monetary growth exceeds target THE DOLLAR fell yesterday to only a fraction of a pfennig above its all-time low against the D-Mark. It closed in London at DM1.4455, compared with the nadir of DM1.4430 reached in February 1991. The dollar's weakness helped to pull sterling to its lowest point against the D-Mark since Britain joined the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System in October 1990. The pound's fall to DM2.8070 left it less than three pfennigs above its permitted floor against the D-Mark in the EMS. If it reaches the floor of DM2.7780, the British government will be forced to support it either by heavy intervention on the foreign exchanges, or by raising interest rates. Dealers sold dollars and pounds after the Bundesbank issued its latest figure for German money supply growth. The broad money M3 measure grew at an annualised rate of 8.6 per cent between the fourth quarter of 1991 and last month, compared with 8.7 per cent in June. Although the trend is downwards, the Bundesbank's target growth rate of 3.5 per cent to 5.5 per cent for the year as a whole will certainly be missed, giving the German central bank no reason to relax its tight monetary policy. For sterling, the situation is compounded by worries about the British economy. The decline in retail sales in July and the slight fall in second quarter output reported earlier this week suggest that the the immediate prospects for recovery remain dim. Yesterday, UK money supply figures for July - showing an increase from previous month - reduced fears that the economy may be sliding into further decline, although they provided little sign of an upturn. M0, which mostly comprises notes and coins in circulation, increased by 2.4 per cent in the 12 months to the end of July, after a year-on-year rise of 1.3 per cent in June and 2.5 per cent in May. M4, a broader measure which also takes in bank and building society deposits, rose 5.7 per cent in the year to July 31, after a year-on-year rise of 5.3 per cent in June and of 5.2 per cent in the previous month. The changes in the seasonally adjusted figures fit in with the picture of a flat economy. M0 rose by 1.2 per cent between June and July, while M4 increased by 0.8 per cent. Professor Doug McWilliams, economic adviser to the Confederation of British Industry, said yesterday the UK faced four more quarters of contraction with a recovery delayed until 1994. He predicted a 1 per cent fall in output this year, followed by zero growth next year. Foreign exchange dealers believe that both the Fed and the Bank of England will intervene heavily in the markets if both of their currencies continue to decline. The two concerted interventions made in support of the dollar over the past month have failed to have any lasting effect. Instead, the central banks may be waiting for a point when the intervention will work technically, and the market can be turned. A key requirement is that dealers should be so short of dollars and sterling that they enter an intense session of buying when the exchange rate starts to rise. It appears that, as yet, the market is not sufficiently short of both currencies. Although the Bundesbank Council meeting concluded yesterday without a change in interest rate policy, the market is still fearful of a rise in the internationally sensitive Lombard rate following the increase in the discount rate. Money market interest rates are around the same level as the 9.75 per cent Lombard rate. In the past, the Bundesbank has used this as an excuse for 'technical' raising of the Lombard rate to stop banks borrowing from the supposedly emergency Lombard facility.

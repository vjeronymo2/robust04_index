			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Perot attacks Nafta over 'threat to jobs': Prince of the pie charts returns to the screen MR ROSS PEROT, independent presidential candidate in the US last year, this weekend accused the Clinton administration of using taxpayers' dollars to promote the North American Free Trade Agreement. The Texan billionaire warned Americans that the pact with Canada and Mexico would jeopardise their jobs. In a paid television 'info-mercial', he made his case against Nafta with the sort of pie charts and graphs he wielded during the presidential campaign, and with film of Mexican slums. Greedy factory owners would move south of the border to take advantage of a minimum wage of 58 US cents (37 pence) an hour, Mr Perot said. The loss of US jobs would make it impossible to balance the US budget. 'If you and I sit here complacently, it will create the giant sucking sound I've been talking about,' he said of the job flight to Mexico. He urged voters to write 'Nafta yes' or 'Nafta no' on a piece of paper and send it to their Congressmen, the White House and him. Mr Perot excoriated the 'lobbyists in the employ of foreign governments', who he said had written the agreement. He signed off the half-hour broadcast somewhat awkwardly, concluding, 'I love you'. Supplements to the Nafta, signed last year for the US by the Bush administration, are being negotiated by Washington, Ottawa and Mexico City. After that, the accord would need approval by the US Congress. The Clinton administration had sought, even before the Perot appearance, to limit the damage with a show for the press - billed as 'a serious in-depth discussion' - by three members of the cabinet. Although they came prepared with their own visuals, to argue that jobs would be lost with or without a Nafta, they inexplicably kept cameras out of the briefing room. Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, used his graph to demonstrate how exports to Mexico had soared in 1986-92, creating 425,000 relatively well-paid US jobs in the process. Handling the popular Mr Perot gingerly, Mr Kantor said the unpredictable billionaire had been 'misled' about the threat of job losses. The Nafta would enhance the prospects of small and medium US businesses which cannot penetrate Mexico's tariff walls. 'Opponents of this agreement are looking at the future through a rear-view mirror,' he said. When the presentation was taken up by Ms Laura D'Andrea Tyson, head of the council of economic advisers, the focus shifted from the impact of the Nafta to the outcome if it were not to be enacted. Mexico's liberalisation 'could easily be derailed', and many of the new jobs created could be lost, she said. 'There's a great cost to not going forward.' Mr Robert Reich, labour secretary, said: 'Long term, America cannot compete on the basis of low wages. The only way we can build up the American economy is through a very different strategy premised on education, training, infrastructure and resources in the private sector, to continue to invest in America.'</p>

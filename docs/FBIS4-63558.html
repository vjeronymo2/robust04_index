			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 97 (587); </F> compiled by Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy and edited by  Vladimir Shishlin]    [Text] The talks between Kishinev [Chisinau] and Tiraspol  on a settlement in the Dniester river valley will be difficult.  The statement was made to the press in Kishinev by President  Mircea Snegur. He said the Tiraspol side stands for making  Moldova a federal state or confederation, which is unacceptable  for Kishinev.    As for the special legal status of Tiraspol Snegur said one  can judge about its form only when the first version of the  draft law is available. So far one can only say that it is a  question of decentralizing executive power, surrendering the  functions of local self-government to Tiraspol in the framework  of a common state with a common constitution, foreign policy,  armed forces, and law enforcement bodies.    Snegur spoke with satisfaction that concrete steps are taken  to restore the common economic space of Moldova.    The president said that the withdrawal of the 14th Russian  Army from Moldova should not be linked with the special legal  status of the area.    Meanwhile, according to the secretary of state of the  self-proclaimed Transdniester Republic Valeriy Litskay the joint  statement of the leaders of Kishinev and Tiraspol has not been  duly applied in practice and negotiations have actually stopped.    Litskay said that at the moment the sides are actively  preparing for the resumption of the talks but it is too early to  speak of concrete proposals. According to him, groups of  experts dealing with economic problems and the settlement of  mutual debts are the most active.    As for defining the status of the river valley, the work in  this direction has practically stopped, Litskay said.    Tiraspol is linking the absence of the progress at the talks  with the fact that Kishinev wants to resolve the problem of the  Gagauzi ethnic minority and then use the solution as a pattern  for defining the status of Tiraspol. It wants to win the  support of international organizations in that.</p>

			<p><P> February 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A coalition of conservation groups urged the Bush Administration to spend $781  million next year to buy land that might otherwise be lost to developers in and  around national preserves in 46 states. The money would come from the Land and  Water Conservation Fund, which is largely funded with money from oil-drilling  on the federally owned outer continental shelf, the coalition said. The  purchase of land under the fund fell under former President Ronald Reagan, from  $509 million in 1980 to $206 million this year. President Bush has recommended  keeping spending at $206 million for the next fiscal year. Among the  recommendations is the purchase of 5,000 acres in Zuma, Trancas and Corral  canyons and elsewhere in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area  for $30 million.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By UKRINFORM correspondent for TASS] </F>   [Text] Kiev, 1 Apr -- The Canadian Government is allocating  15 million Canadian dollars to assist Ukraine in dismantling  nuclear weapons and ensuring nuclear safety. This was stated  today at a joint news conference with Ukraine's Foreign Affairs  Minister Anatoliy Zlenko by his Canadian counterpart Andre  Ouellett who is in Ukraine on an official visit. He stressed  that this aid package is part of the West's efforts to assist in  ridding Ukraine of nuclear weapons, and of support for its  adherence to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.    "Canada undertakes to cooperate closely with Ukraine in  strengthening international stability and security," the  Canadian minister said. This package will help Ukraine to get  rid of nuclear weapons by introducing the experience of Canadian  experts in the sphere of such pressing problems as the skillful  utilization of nuclear waste, the rehabilitation of the  environment, and the development of civilian nuclear systems  that are dangerous." Andre Ouellett said that the package of  assistance in dismantling nuclear weapons is part of the  Canadian program of technical and humanitarian assistance to  Ukraine. It has been created to support Ukraine's changeover to  the market economy, to promote the development of democracy, and  to expand trade and investment ties between Ukraine and Canada.    To date, more than 60 projects in such priority areas as  environmental protection, public health, strengthening the  private sector, and the development of democracy have been  approved. Andre Ouellett also said that he regards his visit to  Ukraine as extremely successful. Important talks were held with  Ukraine's President Leonid Kravchuk, Foreign Affairs Ministers  Anatoliy Zlenko, Oleh Slepichev, external economic relations  minister, and Economy Minister Roman Shpek. A number of joint  documents were signed determining the further development and  expansion of political, economic, and trade relations between  the two countries.    In the course of the visit, several cardinal projects of  Canadian aid to Ukraine were announced. Their total value is  assessed at 27 million Canadian dollars.    "The history of our relations is an excellent example of an  international policy of mutual understanding and partnership,"  Anatoliy Zlenko stressed at a news conference. "Ukraine will  also remember and highly value the fact that Canada was the  first among the Western countries to recognize independent  Ukraine and established diplomatic relations with it. We are  grateful to Canada for its support for our state in the  international arena. During our conversation Andre Ouellett and  I discussed a wide range of issues among which: Nuclear  disarmament, conversion, economic and trade ties, and the  present-day political situation. It is pleasant to note that we  reached mutual understanding on virtually all issues. The  documents signed are proof of our resolve to continue developing  mutually advantageous relations. For us it is very important to  have in Canada a reliable partner. That is why we have signed  perhaps for the first time in international practice a document  entitled `Declaration on Special Partner Relations Between  Ukraine and Canada.' We are looking with optimism to the future  of our relations and believe they will benefit our two friendly  peoples," Anatoliy Zlenko stated.</p>

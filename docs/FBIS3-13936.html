President Hafiz al-Asad led  those who received him at Damascus International Airport. Also  present at the airplane ramp were Vice Presidents 'Abd-al-Halim  Khaddam and Dr. Muhammad Zuhayr Mashariqah, Prime Minister  Mahmud al-Zu'bi, Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar', and Bahrain's  Ambassador in Damascus Muhammad Hamad al-Muhaymid. [passage  omitted]    After a brief rest at the airport's VIP lounge, President  Hafiz al-Asad and his important guest left in an official  motorcade for Tishrin Palace, where his highness will reside.  His Highness Shaykh 'Isa is accompanied by an official  delegation, including Foreign Minister Shaykh Muhammad  Bin-Mubarak, Interior Minister Shaykh Muhammad Bin-Khalifah Al  Khalifah, Transportation Minister Shaykh 'Ali Bin-Khalifah Al  Khalifah, Information Minister Tariq 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Mu'ayyad,  Finance and National Economy Minister Ibrahim 'Abd-al-Karim  Muhammad, Minister of Trade and Agriculture Habib Ahmad Qasim,  and Amiri Court Chief Yusuf Rahmah al-Dusari.    President Hafiz al-Asad and His Highness Shaykh 'Isa  Bin-Salman Al Khalifah held a meeting in Tishrin Palace attended  by the Bahraini delegation accompanying the amir. On the Syrian  side, the meeting was attended by Vice Presidents 'Abd-al-Halim  Khaddam and Muhammad Zuhayr Mashariqah, Prime Minister Mahmud  al-Zu'bi, Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar', Interior Minister Dr.  Muhammad Harbah, Information Minister Dr. Muhammad Salman,  Economy and Foreign Trade Minister Dr. Muhammad al-'Imadi,  Presidential Affairs Minister Wahib Fadil, Agriculture Minister  As'ad Mustafa, and Transportation Minister Dr. Radwan Martini.    In a statement to the media, Shaykh 'Isa Bin-Salman Al  Khalifah said: It is my pleasure to be on this brotherly visit  to the sisterly Syrian Arab Republic--the cradle of Arab  civilization, the launching pad for pan-Arab awakening, and the  rallying point for the Arabs--in order to meet with brother  President Hafiz al-Asad whom we hold in deep respect and  fondness for what his excellency enjoys in terms of pan-Arab  devotion and a farsighted vision of current Arab and  international developments. This is in addition to his  honorable and firm principled stands on pan-Arab issues and  toward all Arab brothers in the big Arab Homeland.    It is also my pleasure to express during this visit the deep  feelings of love and solidarity the government and people of  Bahrain have toward the fraternal Syrian people and their  national government. Our fraternal countries met, each from  their vital position in the Arab world, on the road to national  commitment and adherence to the joint interests of our Arab  nation in terms of its awakening and building. Syria has played  a distinguished Arab role since the beginning of the process by  spreading enlightened Arab awareness, entrenching the values of  Arab civilization and culture, standing in solidarity with our  fraternal Arab brothers at various stages and against all  challenges.    Fraternal Syria's stand during the October 1973 war,  championing the Arab right to Palestine and the Arab territories  had a great impact in creating an effective Arab consensus. We  are now in real need for solidarity under the critical  circumstances we are facing to confront the rapid challenges and  developments in the region and around the world. We now  reaffirm our full support for the comprehensive peace process  based on pan-Arab constants and principles to which we, along  with sisterly Syria and fraternal Arabs, adhere. We must  reaffirm that in order to achieve stability and development for  the people of the entire region, the peace process should be  based on the principle of comprehensive and just peace.    Peace cannot pervail without restoring the territories. Land  should be exchanged for peace. Based on this basic principle,  we reaffirm that Bahrain supports Syria's demand for a full  Israeli withdrawal from its occupied territories and its  legitimate right to the full return of the occupied Syrian Golan  to Syrian sovereignty without encroaching on its international  borders under any claim whatsoever.    On another pan-Arab level, we must praise Syria's just stand  on the issue of liberating Kuwait and returning it to its  owners. In continuation of this positive stand, Syria's  coordination with its sisterly states in the Gulf Cooperation  Council and with Egypt within the framework of the Damascus  declaration is the best formula to support the march of Arab  cooperation.    In conclusion, we look forward to more steps toward  coordination and cooperation between our two fraternal countries  during this renewed brotherly meeting with brother President  Hafiz al-Asad and his countrymen as a reinforcement of our  distinguished and constructive brotherly relations. We believe  that these relations are a positive and advanced model in the  march of joint Arab action. An Arab greeting from Bahrain to the  leadership and people of Syria, the stronghold of Arabism.</p>

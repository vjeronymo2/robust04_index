			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Motoring: How to deal with a dirty dog Dripping labradors and golf bags attached to trolleys have one thing in common; they are not car-friendly. When we had a much loved black labrador, she travelled in the back of the family Renault 4, separated from the metal floor by a couple of flour sacks. Labradors cannot stay out of scummy ponds and are prone to roll in unmentionable things. After months of wondering about the source of the over-ripe pong, I realised it was the sacks. When I threw them out the car smelled sweeter and, from then on, the dog travelled on old towels and bits of blanket that were thrown out as they became too gamey. There is now a much better option; a Quiltie from a small company in Oxfordshire called Over The Top Textiles (tel: 0608-676625). This is a triple-layered fabric mat with a non-slip base that stops dogs from sliding around when they leap aboard or if the car is cornered too quickly. The top layer, which looks like tweed, is non-absorbent. The essence of wet dog passes through to the absorbent wadding that is the meat in the Quiltie sandwich. As the mud on the top layer turns to dust, it can be vacuumed away. In any case, the whole thing is machine washable. Quilties come in standard sizes or are tailored to particular cars. My daughter's two labradors now travel in style on one fitted to the load space of what has become a surprisingly fragrant Citroen XM estate. Prices range from Pounds 63.95 (tailored to estates and 4x4s) or Pounds 13.95 upward in standard sizes. Curtains to protect load space sides are also available. Two sets of golf clubs in trolleys are almost as awkward as a bicycle to fit into cars. Even in those with as much apparent space as a Range Rover, they leave little room for holiday luggage, which overflows on to the back seats. Two-up, that is no problem. But when four people are travelling, the best solution is a moulded plastic roof box. This motoring equivalent of a home extension fixes on a pair of bars - or, better still, the cross members of an estate car's roof rack. Halfords has a wide range costing between Pounds 180 to Pounds 420 (including roof bars and fitting kit). A Pounds 249.97 Swedish-made Thule box I tried looked neat atop a Citroen Xantia, held two golf bags and trolleys plus several soft bags, and had little effect on fuel consumption at moderate speeds. It proved watertight in a downpour. The main snags are that, with the box on, a sun-roof becomes pointless. And even when the box is removed, the supporting bars create quite a lot of wind noise.</p>

			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Technology: Fighting on foreign soil - US defence contractors find they have to work hard to compete in the civilian market In a bid to ease the US defence industry's suffering over more military spending cuts, President Bill Clinton has been zealously promoting the concept of 'dual use' - the civilian and commercial use of technologies originally developed for the Pentagon. The administration has even pledged USDollars 500m (Pounds 330m) to help former defence contractors convert their plants to non-military production. Yet many groups in the industry are discovering that although the potential rewards are enticing, the task of switching technologies from the military to the civilian and commercial sectors is daunting. 'There is a great temptation to want to spin off all this great technology we've developed in many directions, but we have to realise that there's no magic that will make us capable of operating in another sector overnight,' says Ronald Smith, director of business policy at Grumman, the defence contractor. The histories of defence contractors are strewn with casualties from the battle to enter new sectors. Many companies have been trying to make the switch for years but have met with limited success. Grumman made an aborted attempt at marketing buses, and McDonnell Douglas, the aerospace group, backed a number of failed products in an attempt to diversify. 'We tried microwave vacuums for drying grain and flying fire engines (fire-fighting aeroplanes) but they didn't do very well,' says James Caldwell, director of industry participation at McDonnell Douglas. 'Our foray into computer and information systems was also a financial loser. Attempts to go outside our core experience have, with few exceptions, met with resounding failure.' Flops like these have forced defence contractors to come to terms with their limitations. One of the biggest hurdles facing military manufacturers is their lack of a strong marketing capability. Many defence groups have no advertising department, no distribution network and a limited sales force, making it difficult for them to sell their products to a large market. 'Most defence groups haven't got the slightest idea how to sell a product on the mass market,' says Greg Frisby, president of Frisby Airborne, a Long Island-based hydraulics group and defence contractor. 'That's not surprising. After all, they spend most of their time dealing with a single customer, the Pentagon.' Marketing is not the only problem the industry faces. Civilian and commercial work can also present cash-flow difficulties, as companies used to getting paid in military-style instalments for continuing work are forced to wait until after delivery to receive any payment. 'When we started doing commercial work, it was hard for us to finance ourselves,' Frisby says. 'Defence contractors get used to counting on regular payments from the military.' Defence contractors are also snowed under by the astronomical wages they are forced to pay their highly educated workforce. 'We pay mechanics Dollars 18 an hour because we need their level of skills to produce military-standard products,' says Robert O'Brien, public affairs director at McDonnell Douglas. 'But a lot of consumer products don't need that level of expertise, and we can't compete with someone who's paying employees Dollars 6 an hour to put out the same product.' The industry also complains about the Pentagon's stringent specifications, which are so demanding that they price the product out of the consumer market. 'There are 15 pages of specifications for ketchup in the military, and you can extrapolate from that,' says Smith. 'Obviously, your average consumer is not willing to pay the extra cost it takes to meet those specifications. The consumer is performance-oriented, the military specifications-oriented. They are completely different markets,' he adds. Many companies are now demanding that the Pentagon loosen its requirements to allow them to compete more effectively in both the military and the civilian worlds. 'In some cases, civilian equipment is more than adequate to serve military needs,' says Caldwell. 'The Lear Jet is a good example of a non-military defence aeroplane that works perfectly well for defence transportation. In the past, the military has had a tendency to over-specify.' Despite the myriad difficulties involved with conversion, defence contractors say that in the face of a diminished federal military budget, it is essential to find new markets. Companies insist that non-military applications can be found for most of their products, and they have come up with a number of successes. 'There's clearly not much of a market outside the military for B-52 bombers or nuclear missiles but most products can be adapted in some way,' says Noel Longuemare, head of the systems development and technology division at Westinghouse Electric Corporation in Baltimore. Westinghouse's defence arm, Westinghouse Electronic Systems, has been hailed by Clinton as a conversion success story. The group reduced its reliance on defence work from 84 per cent in 1986 to 73 per cent today. Westinghouse accomplished this by successfully marketing its military surveillance technology as air traffic control equipment, and selling military security products to civilian police forces. By marketing thermal control systems to the oil industry, Frisby Airborne has made an even bigger switch, from being 95 per cent defence-dependent in 1985 to just 25 per cent today. Boeing, the aircraft manufacturer, has long maintained a balance between military and commercial sales, and McDonnell Douglas has successfully adapted a number of military aeroplane technologies to the commercial market. Most of the success stories, though, have taken place outside the mass market. 'Selling to non-defence sectors of the government is a good option for defence groups wanting to make a switch,' says Smith. 'One of the things defence companies know how to deal with is red tape and bureaucracy. Dealing with the civilian side of the government is far closer to the sort of business we're used to than consumer products.' Another option for defence groups is to sell big-ticket items in low-volume markets. Both McDonnell Douglas and Boeing have been successful at marketing their aircraft to the commercial as well as the military sector. 'With aeroplanes, we're dealing with a high-technlogy, low-volume business,' says Caldwell. 'It's clearly more in line with our business culture than, for instance, selling laptops would be.' Still, some defence contractors insist that the mass market is an option if it is approached in the right way. Westinghouse, for instance, has joined Chrysler in a joint venture to develop technology for electric cars. 'Joint ventures are a good way to go because you can join with companies who know the markets well,' Longuemare says. Although conversion may be the wave of the future, defence groups are quick to point out that there is still a lot of money to be made in sales to the Pentagon. 'I think the main point is that the communication between the commercial and defence sides must be improved,' says Russ Young, a spokesman for Boeing. 'In many cases the same technology can be used in both areas.' Young points to the successful adaptation, not only of military models for commercial use, but also the use of commercial aeroplanes for the Pentagon. 'Our 707s and 767s were both used for conversion to military aircraft,' he says. As novices entering a new line of business, defence contractors are likely to see more failures along the road to non-military production. Still, companies are learning from their mistakes and are gradually finding niche markets in which they can compete effectively. 'Dual use' may not be the answer to all their problems but most contractors are ready to give conversion a try. With the once deep pockets of the Pentagon becoming ever more shallow, most feel they have no other choice.</p>

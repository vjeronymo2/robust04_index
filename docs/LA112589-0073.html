			<p><P> November 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROTESTS TOPPLE CZECH REGIME;  </P> <P> EAST BLOC: COMMUNIST PARTY LEADER JAKES AND THE REST OF THE POLITBURO QUIT  AFTER A WEEK OF DEMONSTRATIONS. A NEW LEADER IS NAMED. AND ALEXANDER DUBCEK,  THE 'PRAGUE SPRING' REFORMER, MAKES A TRIUMPHANT RETURN.  </P> <P> The hard-line Czechoslovak regime cracked under the weight of mass public  dissent Friday after one of the most extraordinary days in the country's  postwar history.  </P> <P> It was a day that saw the downfall of repressive Communist leader Milos Jakes  and the rise of an obscure Politburo member, Karel Urbanek, 48.  </P> <P> Urbanek's appointment as party general secretary followed the mass resignation  of both the Communist Party's 13-member ruling Politburo and 14 department  heads who collectively make up the party's Secretariat.  </P> <P> It was also the day of an emotional reappearance in the capital by Alexander  Dubcek, the long-disgraced architect of the 1968 "Prague Spring" reform  movement.  </P> <P> The roar from the 300,000 Czechoslovaks that greeted the former Communist Party  leader as he emerged onto a fifth-floor balcony overlooking the city's main  Wenceslas Square seemed to unleash emotions held tight since Soviet and Warsaw  Pact tanks crushed Dubcek's liberal experiment and the Kremlin installed  hard-liners 21 years ago.  </P> <P> And it was a day that saw members of the fledgling opposition group Civic Forum  interrupt their news conference with word that Jakes had resigned. They  embraced, broke open champagne and listened to their leading spokesman,  playwright Vaclav Havel, raise his glass and toast, "Long live a free  Czechoslovakia!"  </P> <P> Friday's developments in Czechoslovakia represent the latest in a series of  stunning political changes in the Warsaw Pact nations of Eastern Europe --  beginning in Poland and Hungary before sweeping through East Germany and  Bulgaria.  </P> <P> In addition to losing the party leadership, Jakes was thrown out of the  Politburo and also lost his job as head of the party secretariat.  </P> <P> Five other prominent hard-liners were also demoted out of the Politburo,  including party ideologue Jan Fojtik.  </P> <P> Reporting on the Central Committee seating, secretariat member Zdenek Horeni  told reporters that the committee declared that a strategy of democratization  and restructuring is irreversible.  </P> <P> He said the committee also invited organizations from outside the ruling party  to join in a dialogue to find a political solution to the country's problems.  </P> <P> The Central Committee also urged swift action on new laws liberalizing the  rights of assembly and association and greater press freedoms.  </P> <P> Horeni said that details of this new policy will be fleshed out at a another  Central Committee meeting to be convened before mid-December.  </P> <P> But it was not a total victory for the reformists. Prague party boss Miroslav  Stepan, the man generally viewed as responsible for last week's police  crackdown on a student demonstration, kept his post in the Politurbo, while  reform-minded members including Prime Minister Ladislav Adamec lost their  places.  </P> <P> Political analysts believed that Friday's shake-up would not be the end of  changes in the ruling hierarchy.  </P> <P> "Round 2 is coming," said one Western diplomat.  </P> <P> Adamec, the man most analysts believed would succeed Jakes as party secretary,  resigned both from the Politburo and the prime minister's post.  </P> <P> Czechoslovakia's Communist Party Central Committee was meeting into the early  hours this morning to nominate and elect replacements for a new Politburo.  </P> <P> As news of the Politburo's resignations spread, a party atmosphere swept the  capital's central area.  </P> <P> People gathered around television sets in storefront windows, smiling, cheering  and congratulating each other. Car horns honked, and trams rang their bells.  </P> <P> "I think it will be a party. We will be here all night," Andrea Swarc, a Prague  housewife, said.  </P> <P> The choice of Urbanek, a trained economist and former head of the party in the  Czech republic, came as a surprise. He was mentioned only in passing among  those awaiting the possible succession to Jakes and was described by one  political analyst as an ambiguous figure.  </P> <P> "He's someone who at times came out against dissident groups, but not as  vociferously as others," this analyst said.  </P> <P> One Western diplomat here described Urbanek as "benign."  </P> <P> Urbanek's immediate task will be to steer the Communist Party through its  present crisis and to prepare for negotiations with the opposition -- talks  that could lead to the diminution of the party's monopoly of power and the  rebirth of political pluralism in Czechoslovakia. Opposition figures say they  are determined to remove the constitutional provision that guarantees the  leading role of the party.  </P> <P> Urbanek's appointment to lead the party was seen as significant for two  reasons: First, his relative obscurity leaves him untouched by the failure of  the party's senior leadership -- those in charge during the recent years of  repression and ineffectual performance as well as during the past week's  crisis.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't say the population would see him as responsible for something," a  Western diplomat said.  </P> <P> Secondly, Urbanek can be more easily accepted by the conservative Central  Committee, even though he has shown tinges of reformism.  </P> <P> Together the Politburo, where Urbanek has served since October, 1988, and the  Secretariat are the two entities that constitute the country's power center.  </P> <P> "We have failed to justly assess the processes taking place in Poland, Hungary  and especially in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) and their  influence on our society," Jakes was reported by the Czechoslovak news agency  CTK as telling the Central Committee in a brutally candid speech before  resigning.  </P> <P> Indeed, the political changes in Czechoslovakia have occurred with breathtaking  speed.  </P> <P> It was only 10 months ago that playwright Havel was arrested for attempting to  place flowers at the place on Wenceslas Square where Czechoslovak student Jan  Palach burned himself to death in 1969 to protest the Soviet invasion of the  country.  </P> <P> The anniversary of Palach's death has long been a rallying point for the  opposition movement. This year the demonstrations surrounding the memorial  observances lasted for five days and were brutally suppressed by police.  </P> <P> On Friday, the capital was a sea of anti-government graffiti and wall posters,  many of them supporting a general strike planned for Monday. One major reason  for Friday's emergency Central Committee meeting and the change in political  leadership was an attempt to undermine the general strike.  </P> <P> Urbanek has virtually no public profile in the country. In recent times he has  been in charge of monitoring political reforms and their effect on party  function, not a job usually considered a power base in the party.  </P> <P> For the past year, Urbanek has headed a commission dealing with "cadre policy,"  a post dealing with promotions and recruitment matters, both areas that affect  the future shape of the party membership.  </P> <P> The news of the Politburo's resignation came as leaders of the Civic Forum  appeared in what has become the opposition's regular evening briefing for the  international media. As Havel and Vaclav Maly shared microphones with Dubcek --  who was explaining that he still believes "socialism is reformable" -- Havel's  brother Ivan scurried onto the stage and whispered in Vaclav's ear.  </P> <P> After Dubcek finished his answer, through which Havel leaned forward in evident  tension, the news was announced by an opposition journalist.  </P> <P> Havel, Dubcek, Maly and a student leader jumped to their feet and embraced on  the stage as cheers broke out from supporters in the crowd. Someone hurried  forward with a bottle of champagne and glasses.  </P> <P> "Long live a free Czechoslovakia!" shouted Havel, his glass lifted high.  </P> <P> "It's a mass execution," said a Czechoslovak journalist, grinning and shaking  his head in amazement.  </P> <P> "I have no special illusion about gentlemen who will replace those who have  just resigned," Havel cautioned.  </P> <P> These men, he said, "were the men who organized a coup and . . . the occupation  of our country. As long as these people do not return to the Central Committee,  it means the door has opened and we can take the steps to begin the life of a  democratic Czechoslovakia."  </P> <P> RELATED STORIES -- pictures are on A7 to A12  </P></p>

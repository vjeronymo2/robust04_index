			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Hollinger sale of Trinity Sir, In your article of September 15 ('Company News') concerning Trinity International Holdings, you refer to Mr Conrad Black as a 'disgruntled shareholder' and imply that the Trinity shares held originally by Hollinger Inc and later The Telegraph plc were sold because Trinity 'rebuffed Mr Black's overtures for a seat on the board'. Hollinger Inc originally purchased shares in Trinity International with the intention of eventually deciding whether or not to attempt to take control. Notwithstanding the limited voting status of the shares, Hollinger always believed that control could be achieved by virtue of the fact that the limited voting shares did have the right to vote on any motion to sell all of the assets of Trinity or to wind up the company. A significant shareholder, such as Hollinger was, could have called a shareholder meeting and put such matters to a vote. We sold the interest in Trinity because the share price had risen and we believed that any bid to acquire majority ownership would be overly expensive and also because of the purchase of an interest in Southam Inc. In addition to the sale of the Trinity interest generating funding for the Southam interest, the concentration of ownership of newspapers in British Columbia among Hollinger Inc, Southam Inc and Trinity International would likely have posed problems for the Hollinger Group under the Canadian Competition Act. J A Boultbee, vice president, finance and treasury, Hollinger Inc, 10 Toronto Street, Toronto, Canada M3C 2B7</p>

			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Boudiaf was 'conspiracy' victim The murder last June of Mr Mohamed Boudiaf, the Algerian acting head of state, by one of his bodyguards was a conspiracy that mainly benefited radical Moslem movements, according to a commission of inquiry set up by the country's leadership writes Francis Ghiles in London. The 118-page report has not been published, but Mr Rezzag Bara, the commission chairman, said on state television that the conspiracy was put together 'by those whose interests were threatened'. A total of 30 members of the Algerian security forces have been charged with 'serious negligence' in placing Lt Lembarek Boumarafi, the assassin, who was known for his support for radical Moslem views, in a group whose duty was to protect a man well known for his opposition to such views. The inquiry did not determine whether the negligence was deliberate. No senior Algerian has publicly accused the now banned Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) of murdering Mr Boudiaf. Indeed, some have privately told western officials that the FIS is not to blame. The FIS for its part has never claimed responsibility.</p>

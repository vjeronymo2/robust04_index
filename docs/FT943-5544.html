			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Ex-prisoner loses HK poll plea Mr Lau San-Ching, a Hong Kong resident who has spent much of the past 10 years as a political prisoner in China, yesterday failed in his attempt to challenge Hong Kong's residency requirements for the forthcoming elections. A High Court judge ruled against lifting his disqualification from standing in this month's district board elections because he had not been 'ordinarily resident' in the colony for the last 10 years. Justice Mayo said Mr Lau's appeal for judicial review of his case was inappropriate and he should submit an 'election petition' under Hong Kong's election law. This could not be heard until after the election, meaning that Mr Lau would not be able to stand until after 1997, when Chinese sovereignty over Hong Kong might mean he is still ineligible for office. Mr Lau said he was very disappointed with the judgment, and he could not afford an election petition as it did not qualify for legal aid.</p>

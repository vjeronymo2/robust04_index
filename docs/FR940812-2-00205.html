Customer Protection <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission believes that a regulatory system designed to protect public customers must be in place before the trading of sophisticated financial instruments, such as Mexico Index options (including full-value and reduced-value Mexico LEAPS), can commence on a national securities exchange. The Commission notes that the trading of standardized exchange-traded options occurs in an environment that is designed to ensure, among other things, that: (1) the special risks of options are disclosed to public customers; (2) only investors capable of evaluating and bearing the risks of options trading are engaged in such trading; and (3) special compliance procedures are applicable to options accounts. Accordingly, because the Index options and Index LEAPS will be subject to the same regulatory regime as the other standardized options currently traded on the Amex, the Commission believes that adequate safeguards are in place to ensure the protection of investors in Mexico Index options and full-value and reduced-value Mexico Index LEAPS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Surveillance <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission believes that a surveillance sharing agreement between an exchange proposing to list a security index derivative product and the exchange(s) trading the securities underlying the derivative product is an important measure for surveillance of the derivative and underlying securities markets. Such agreements ensure the availability of information necessary to detect and deter potential manipulations and other trading abuses, thereby making the security index product less readily susceptible to manipulation. <FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>  In this regard, the Amex, NYSE, and NASD are all members of the ISG, which provides for the exchange of all necessary surveillance information. <FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>  Further, as to present and future ADR components of the Index, either the Exchange will have comprehensive surveillance sharing agreements with the primary foreign markets for the securities underlying the ADRs or the U.S. will be the relevant market for surveillance purposes. <FOOTCITE>24</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 22 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 31243 (September 28, 1992), 57 FR 45849 (October 5, 1992). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 23 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> If the prices of the ADR components, or the composition of the Index, should change so that greater than 20% of the weight of the Index would be represented by ADRs whose underlying securities were not the subject of a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement with the Amex, then it would be difficult for the Commission to reach the conclusions reached in this order and the Commission would have to determine whether it would be suitable for the Exchange to continue to trade options on this Index. The Amex should, accordingly, notify the Commission immediately if more than 20% of the numerical value of the Index is represented by ADRs whose underlying securities are not subject to a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement. Such a change in the current relative weights of the Index or in the composition of the Index may warrant the submission of a rule filing pursuant to Section 19 of the Act. In determining whether a particular ADR is subject to a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> see <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 31531 (November 27, 1992), 57 FR 57250 (December 3, 1992); and 33554 (January 31, 1994), 59 FR 5622 (February 7, 1994). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 24 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 31531 (November 27, 1992), 57 FR 57250 (December 3, 1992); and 33554 (January 31, 1994), 59 FR 5622 (February 7, 1994). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Market Impact <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission believes that the listing and trading of Mexico Index options, including full-value and reduced-value Index LEAPS, on the Amex will not adversely impact the underlying securities markets. First, as described above, for the most part, no one security or group of securities dominates the Index. Second, because at least 90% of the numerical value of the Index and at least 80% of the components of the Index must be accounted for by securities that meet the Exchange's options listing standards, and because each of the component securities must be subject to last sale reporting pursuant to Rule 11Aa3&hyph;1 of the Act, <FOOTCITE>25</FOOTCITE>  the component securities generally will be actively-traded, highly-capitalized securities. Third, the 7,500 contract position and exercise limits applicable to Index options and Index LEAPS will serve to minimize potential manipulation and market impact concerns. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 25 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Amendment No. 3. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission believes that settling expiring Mexico Index options (including full-value and reduced-value Index LEAPS) based on the opening prices of component securities is consistent with the Act. As noted in other contexts, valuing options for exercise settlement on expiration based on opening prices rather than closing prices may help reduce adverse effects on markets for securities underlying options on the Index. <FOOTCITE>26</FOOTCITE>  Lastly, the Commission believes the ability to use Auto-Ex for orders of up to 50 contracts will provide customers with liquid markets and efficient executions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 26 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Securities Exchange Act Release No. 30944 (July 21, 1992), 57 FR 33376 (July 28, 1992). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section 6(b)(5). <FOOTCITE>27</FOOTCITE>  In particular, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the Section 6(b)(5) requirement that the rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade and not to permit unfair discrimination between customers, issuers, brokers, and dealers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 27 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. &sect;78f(b)(5) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change, as amended, and Amendment No. 4 to the Exchange's proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Amendment No. 4 clarifies that the Exchange will apply its current rules to determine applicable position limits for the Index options and, therefore, raises no new or unique regulatory issues. Furthermore, the Commission notes that the Amex did not realize the proposal would have been eligible for filing, pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act, under the Generic Narrow Based Index Approval Order. Accordingly, because the effectiveness of the proposal was therefore delayed, in part, by confusion over the proper method under which to file, and considering the proposal has already been subject to a 21-day comment period, and no comments were received, the Commission believes it is consistent with Sections 19(b)(2) and 6(b)(5) of the Act to approve the proposed rule change, as amended, on an accelerated basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III.

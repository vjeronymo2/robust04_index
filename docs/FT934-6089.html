			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Arts: Ballet Rambert - Dance The Rambert Dance Company is embarked on a regional tour with two works new to the repertory. I caught up with the company at the Apollo Theatre, Oxford  -is there an auditorium with less leg-room for anyone who is not a pygmy? On the night after I had seen London Contemporary Dance on grandest form, it was instructive to watch the other troupe involved in the convulsion in dance policy that currently concerns us. It would be idle to pretend that Rambert proposes the gleaming technical prowess which is so handsomely part of LCDT's identity. The company manner is able, honest, but in the two works I saw, the dance was fuzzy-edged and self-indulgent. The choreography - a new work by Mark Baldwin; a revival of Christopher Bruce's Land - came burdened with more 'meaning' than means. The dancing was soggy with good intentions. Mark Baldwin's earlier choreographies told of an alert and off-beat sense of movement. Spirit is set to the Poulenc oboe and clarinet sonatas (excellently played), and it is sponsored by Glaxo Laboratories in the hope of raising public awareness of the torments of migraine. Beyond the suspicion of a nagging headache brought on by watching nine of Rambert's dancers scamper about the stage to no clear purpose, the migraine connection escaped me. The dance is somehow old-fashioned - it has that heavy-with-good-intentions air I associate with apprentice chorographies in the 1960s. The clothes are black and white and not wildly flattering. Intermittent red and yellow curtains are the set. The Poulenc sonatas go their lyrical or witty way, untouched by the dance. It is all ferociously inconclusive. Land is a fair example of Bruce's Week's Good Cause choreography. It was made for Festival Ballet in 1985. Its score is Arne Nordheim's electronic agonisings about Warsaw under the Nazis. Peasant outfits - no-colour Mittel-Europa dresses; waistcoats and puttees for the chaps - and folk-attitudes abound. Everyone has a hell of a time. Sgt. Death is on the rampage. The cast suffer from advanced Kylianism - no day without a good bout of dance anguish - and fall all too easily into martyred poses. It looks like a parody of itself, and of a European cult of politically correct movement. Impossible to care if pieces like this are well-danced: what matters is that they are tremendously well-meant. I would swap the lot for ten seconds from Twyla Tharp or Mark Morris. Siobhan Davies' broad-spanning, spacious Embarque completes the programme. I did not findthe company at the level of lean and uncompromising attainment which it showed under Richard Alston's guidance. If the Alston-shaped repertory was not always popular, it was as rigorous as the dancing. Yet the plan is that the troupe is to be expanded under Christopher Bruce and also developed along 'neo-classic' lines, while retrenchment radically alters LCDT's function. We may draw what odd conclusions we can.</p>

			<p><P> February 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MORNINGSIDE STUDENTS WALK OUT FOR 2ND DAY  </P> <P> Several hundred students left Morningside High School in Inglewood Tuesday, the  second straight school day that classes were interrupted in a protest over what  the students view as substandard conditions on the campus.  </P> <P> Students congregated in front of the school and met with Principal Art Murray  and Supt.  </P> <P> George McKenna of the Inglewood Unified School District to complain about poor  security, a short supply of textbooks and vandalism in bathrooms. Tuesday's  protest began about 10 a.m. and many of the students never returned to class.  </P> <P> The protests began Friday -- before Monday's holiday for Abraham Lincoln's  birthday -- when 500 students marched from Morningside to school district  headquarters.  </P> <P> McKenna has promised to upgrade the 1,300-student campus, but he said some  changes have been stalled because the district is $1 million over budget.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article from the "Opinion" page by Fu Jian: "Planning </F> Takes Different Path"]    [Text] The connotation of the word "planning" is changing  its traditional meaning for Chinese economists.    The largest planning body, the State Planning Commission,  actually redefined the role of planning and investment when it  recently announced more reform measures.    "All that the market can manage should be left to be managed  by the market," said Gui Shiyong, vice-minister of the  commission.    Planning departments should restrict their activities to  those that the market cannot do or has failed to do well, he  added.    Between 1949 and 1992, the government favoured a centrally  planned economy. Planners' tasks were gargantuan, controlling  virtually every aspect of national life.    But this has made decentralization of planning and  investment  a task of similar magnitude.    Thankfully, the efforts have been successful, Vice-Minister  Gui said.    After almost 15 years of reform, local governments and  enterprises have more decision-making power and possess more  self-supplied funds, financial revenue? foreign exchange, as  well as rights for investment.    Directive plans on agricultural production were cancelled in  1985. As for industrial production, goods fulfilling directive  plans make up only 4.5 percent of total industrial output.  Concerning retail sales, only 5 percent of goods in shops are  tagged with imposed directive prices.    With less directives to keep them busy, planning groups have  shifted their function to broad oversight of the economy. That  means less administration but more economic policies and  legislative methods.    However, the existing planning and investment system still  fails to meet market requirements, said Gui.    Outlining the necessary scope, he highlighted the function  of  planning, the content of plans and new methods of implementing  reform. There is a lack of co-ordination among various  regulatory means such as taxes, pricing, interest and exchange  rates, he said.    The public seldom participates in formulating plans, and  planning law is rather weak. Administrative interference still  hampers the decision-making process of enterprises. What's  more, self-restraint has not been established in the investment  system, said Gui.    Since State subsidies remain in many enterprises and  projects  to keep their operation alive, their individual investors are  not actually responsible for them.    The main spur to decentralize came at the 14th National  Congress of the Communist Party of China in October 1992 when  the socialist market economy was conceived. That meant giving  the market the natural power, while downgrading central planning  to a regulatory and aid role.    The State Planning Commission's latest reform aims to  replace  most administrative controls with economic regulations.    For the few cases in which administrative methods and  mandatory planning are actually needed, the methods should be  improved in accordance with the requirements of the market  economy.    Local authorities need to be fully involved in the planning  on the premise of guaranteeing the unity and authority of the  central government, said Gui.    Powers such as issuing currency, determining bench-mark  interest rates, regulating exchange rates and adjusting major  tax categories and tax rates should all be controlled by the  central government.    Economic affairs like local economic development and market  activities can be organized by local authorities.    Public participation in designing and implementing plans  should be strengthened. This would be more open, scientific and  effective, he said.    The commission has already worked out more reform measures  for the investment system.    A new system will strengthen responsibility of enterprises  as  well as banks, according to Gui.    When a project is constructed, certain enterprises must be  identified as being responsible for it--from drafting the  process, raising funds, constructing or producing to repay bank  loans and bonds, as well as monitoring the appreciation of the  asset's value.    A similar responsibility system should also be established  in  banks.    For project approval, a registration system will gradually  replace administrative examination and approval.    Competitive projects with high profit returns and  sensitivity  to market factors will be left to enterprises themselves, with  both decision-making power and risk responsibility given to the  management.    Enterprises will mainly raise funds from commercial banks,  and the government will gradually withdraw their investments in  these projects.    The government will prioritize infrastructure projects and  foundation industries as well as public welfare, science,  education, culture and public health.    Control on the total amount and structure of investment  should be strengthened, Gui said.    The State Development Bank, one of major regulatory means,  was established recently to play a positive role in directing  and adjusting investment. This can be accomplished through its  policy loans, together with other measures such as taxes,  interest rates and prices.    A market system which involves advisory, design,  construction, auditing, and supervision of projects needs to  provide assistance for enterprises. Meanwhile, relative laws  and regulations should be made to ensure orderly investment  activities.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Pan Xiaozhu (3382 1420 3796)] </F>   [Text] Dhaka, 24 Feb (XINHUA) -- Bangladesh Foreign  Minister Mustafizur Rahman hosted a banquet in Dhaka on the  evening of 24 February to welcome Qian Qichen, vice premier of  China's State Council and foreign minister, and his party.    Speaking at the banquet, Mustafizur Rahman extended a warm  welcome to the visit by Foreign Minister Qian Qichen. He  described the visit as "an important landmark in the development  of bilateral relations between the two countries."    Commenting on Bangladesh-Chinese relations, he said: China  is a valuable friend of Bangladesh. Bangladesh cherishes the  Bangladesh-Chinese friendship very much. As time passes, this  friendship will continually and steadily develop.    Mustafizur Rahman highly commended China for its  accomplishments in reform and opening up to the outside world.  He said he believed that China will play an increasingly  important role in international trade and economic relations.    He held that China's rapidly increasing importance in  international economic relations will be conducive to further  improving the global situation.    He indicated: The Bangladesh people will continue to  cooperate with the Chinese people and will make joint efforts to  build a righteous [gong zheng 0361 2973], fair, and peaceful  world.    In his speech, Qian Qichen said that as friendly neighbors,  China and Bangladesh enjoy a profound, traditional friendship.  To develop friendly relations and cooperation with Bangladesh  is a firm policy of the Chinese Government.    Commenting on international relations issues, Qian Qichen  pointed out: Since the end of the cold war, the world has been  progressing toward multipolarization, and international  relations have undergone some positive changes. However, we  have yet to attain peace and development, which are the two main  themes facing mankind. At present, invigorating the economy has  become the common aspiration of peoples of various countries,  and giving priority to economic progress is becoming a main  factor influencing the development of international relations.  Developing countries should strengthen coordination and  cooperation, should preserve peace and stability, should promote  common economic growth, and should make active efforts to  establish a new international political and economic order.    Qian Qichen expressed his hope: Based on the Five Principles  of Peaceful Coexistence and guided by the spirit of mutual  respect and holding consultations on an equal footing, various  countries in South Asia will properly resolve existing problems  among themselves so as to further enhance regional stability and  prosperity.    Qian Qichen also refuted allegations spread by certain  people  about the so-called "China threat" and about China's expansion  into the Indian Ocean. He stressed: China has been pursuing  unswervingly an independent foreign policy of peace and will  never seek hegemony. He said: China will not attempt to  establish a sphere of influence or build a military base in any  part of the world. China is and will remain a force for  preserving world peace and stability.    Senior Bangladesh Government officials, Army and Navy  generals, friendly figures, and Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh  Zhang Xujiang attended the banquet.</p>

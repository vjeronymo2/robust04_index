			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Libya claims renunciation of terrorism LIBYA claimed yesterday that it was renouncing terrorism but again refused to hand over the two men accused by the US and Britain of responsibility for bombing a PanAm aircraft over Scotland in 1988 which killed 270 people, writes Our Middle East Staff. Mr Ibrahim Mohammed Beshari, Libyan foreign minister, said in Indonesia, where he is attending a meeting of the non-aligned movement, his country's laws prevented extradition of the two suspects. A foreign ministry statement issued similtaneously in Tripoli referred only to the second part of UN Security Council's Resolution 731 which called on Tripoli to cut all links to terrorist groups.</p>

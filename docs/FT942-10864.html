			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / International Press Review: Politician to test water on coalition preferences The first step towards form a new Dutch government was taken over the weekend when a senior politician was asked to poll the different parties on their coalition preferences, reports Ronald van de Krol. Mr Herman Tjeenk Willink, a Labour politician who is chairman of the upper house of parliament, was appointed 'informateur' by Queen Beatrix to assess the parties' views. Last week's general election was inconclusive, producing four main parties of almost equal strength. The ruling Christian Democrats and Labour lost their majority in the 150-seat lower of parliament, while two opposition parties, the right-wing Liberals and left-of-centre D66, made strong gains. Several combinations of these parties are possible, but at least three parties will be needed to create a majority in parliament. Mr Tjeenk Willink's first task is to find out whether it will be possible to form a left-right coalition of Labour, D66 and the Liberals. This coalition, described as the 'purple' option because it would span the red of Labour to the 'Tory' blue of the Liberals, would force the Christian Democrats into opposition for the first time. The Christian Democrats, who traditionally dominate Dutch politics, support the idea of investigating the 'purple' option first.</p>

			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Harsh challenge for both Israel and PLOST: The armed tactics of an Islamic militant movement THE WEEKEND kidnapping of an Israeli soldier has underlined not just the strength of Islamic fundamentalists in the occupied territories, but also the challenge they pose both to Israel and to the Palestine Liberation Organisation. The abduction of Sgt Major Nissim Toledano of the paramilitary Border Police as he walked to work in the central Israeli city of Lod was accomplished with cool efficiency by the so-called Qassam military wing of the Hamas 'Islamic Resistance Movement' on the fifth anniversary of the official founding of Hamas. In those five years, Hamas has grown in influence in the West Bank and, especially, in the squalid refugee camps and towns of the Gaza Strip. It sees itself as being in the vanguard of the intifada, the uprising against Israeli rule which erupted in Gaza in December 1987 as Hamas came into being. Lately Hamas has, through Qassam, stepped up its use of firearms against Israeli forces - as distinct from the stones and petrol bombs which otherwise characterise intifada violence. In the last week alone, Qassam has shot dead four soldiers, compared with 20 troops killed in the previous five years of the uprising. These killings and the kidnapping of Sgt Major Toledano are deeply troubling developments for the Israeli army. Troops deployed in the West Bank and Gaza are geared chiefly to combat street rioting - albeit frequently with deadly live fire. They are not set up well against armed ambushes. Few of their jeeps and trucks are bullet proofed as are those of the British forces in Northern Ireland. However, the political challenge of Hamas - an Arabic acronym for Islamic Resistance Movement which also means courage - is probably more worrying for Israel, and, ironically, also for the PLO, traditionally Israel's great enemy. Hamas strongly opposes the Middle East peace talks in Washington which the PLO supports. It rejects not only the scheme of an interim period of self-rule for the Palestinians before talks on the final status of the territories; it rejects outright PLO acceptance of Israel's right to exist alongside a secular, independent Palestinian state. Its ideology demands establishment of an Islamic state in all of Palestine. Israel originally allowed the formation of Islamic groups in Gaza in the hope they would erode the supremacy of the PLO. But the strategy has backfired as Hamas has waxed far stronger than the authorities imagined. PLO supporters say Hamas still attracts only minority support. In the few elections allowed in the West Bank and Gaza recently, such as for chambers of commerce and student bodies, the PLO has tended to come out on top. But in Gaza and some areas of the West Bank, support for Hamas is reckoned by many to be around 40 per cent. The PLO fears Hamas could do uncomfortably well if it chose to participate in general elections proposed in the peace talks - something it has not specifically ruled out. Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, the crippled leader of Hamas whose release from jail is sought by Sgt Major Toledano's kidnappers, certainly believes so. The frail, bearded Sheikh Yassin told the Financial Times in one of the last interviews he gave before he was arrested in 1989: 'The overwhelming majority of Palestinians are Moslems and they do not reject Islam. Even some members of the PLO are supporters of the Islamic movement. That is why I am confident that if there was complete freedom for voters then the Islamic movement would win everywhere - in Gaza, the West Bank and even among Moslems inside Israel.'</p>

			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Management: Finding the child inside the manager People need rewarding. Employees have different characteristics, and should be treated differently. To be understood, be direct. To communicate better, try to understand things from the other person's point of view. The usual tips on how to be a better manager are so blindingly obvious they seem barely worth saying. Yet as most managers seem to disregard such advice most of the time, management trainers can be forgiven for saying the same things over and over again. One such trainer has developped a slightly new way of getting at the old themes. Abe Wagner, a US psychologist, has adapted the principles of Transactional Analysis - a branch of Gestalt psychology - to management. With a bundle of jargon, concepts and psychological chatter he has wooed many Fortune 500 companies. Now he is hoping to do the same in the UK. Last week he told executives from the Department of Transport, the HM Prison Service and Freshfields solicitors to let the natural child in them come out. Wagner preaches that each person is made up of six personality states: the natural child, the adult, the nurturing parent, the rebellious child, the compliant child and the critical parent. The first three of these are helpful states for communicating, and can be used to get all needs and wants met. The second three are all unhelpful  - we should learn to snap out of these states ourselves and try to get our business associates to do likewise. Suppose you have just failed to clinch a sale and find yourself angrily musing about the inadequacies of the potential customer, your sales staff etc. You are in 'critical parent' mode. The best way of recognising this, says Wagner, is to speak your thoughts out loud, understand which mode you are in and then allow the logical 'adult' in you to take over by giving yourself a pep talk. Suppose you find one of your colleagues stuck in rebellious child mode - negative, obstructive and working badly. The worst thing you can do is to play the critical parent by criticising. The best way of stimulating the adult or nurturing parent in them is to behave that way yourself. Cynics might argue these ego states obscure rather than elucidate - allowing you to say something in a complicated way that can be more easily stated directly. You do not need to invoke parents or children to conclude that if someone is unhappy, you should try to understand their problem. Wagner argues that the ego states give a handy frame of reference and suggest subtle strategies for better communication. If an employee is playing the child by refusing to work on Saturdays, it may be better to be the child too, appealing to their emotions rather than their good sense. How well these ideas will go down in Britain remains to be seen. Wagner notes that many male managers have a general problem in showing emotion and discussing feelings - 'they won't let the natural child out'. He suspects that British managers are even more buttoned up than most. 'We as managers have a strong tendency to look and sound like parents,' says Wagner. Employees tend to encourage this by playing the child, leading to what he calls 'co-dependency'. Managers have to really want to change their ways. 'The reason managerial courses don't work is that they are usually used to change someone else.' If they really want to change, then anything can be achieved, he argues. Behavioural studies in the US have shown that unconscious habits can be changed after 21 days of concerted effort. Conscious ones can be changed even faster, he says. If it is really as easy as that, management trainers might shortly find themselves out of a job.</p>

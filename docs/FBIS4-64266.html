			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Stue" report: "More Involvement in Latin America </F> Possible"]    [Text] Bonn, 29 Apr -- German industry is in danger of  eventually losing its good position in Latin America. This fear  has been expressed by Hans-Peter Repnik (Christian Democratic  Union), parliamentary state secretary in the Ministry for  Economic Cooperation. German companies are not involved in any  of the large privatization projects in Latin America in the  fields of energy supply, water supply, or telecommunications,  Repnik said with regret. On the other hand, Spanish and French  competitors, for instance, are very active. If they get first  pick in the privatization of power plants or telephone  companies, it will become increasingly difficult for German  producers to supply, for instance, turbines or  telecommunications facilities. "We must get our foot in the  door in the strategic fields of growth," Repnik demanded.    In Repnik's view, the Japanese have recognized Latin America  as a market of the future. They are also using development aid  as a means to develop markets. Repnik pointed to Tokyo's plans  to increase development aid from $10 to $15 million over the  next five years. Japan has clearly raised its capital share in  the Interamerican Development Bank (IDB) from 1.08 to 5 percent.  It was important that, as a result, the Europeans also raised  their share from 6 to 11 percent, said Repnik, who was chairman  of the Governors' Council until the IDB annual meeting in  Guadalajara/Mexico in April. To increase the German share from  0.99 to 1.9 percent, Bonn must pay 53 million German marks. In  return, German presence in the Directorate has been achieved.  Parallel to raising the IDB's capital by $40 billion to $101  billion, it was decided to give priority in the bank's work to  promoting social justice and combating poverty.    In contrast to the Japanese strategy, the FRG wants to  reduce  its share in contributions to multilateral institutions in the  development budget from 34 to 30 percent in the medium term.  One will pay more attention to the efficiency of the work of  the international organizations and perhaps reduce the German  contribution to one or the other of these institutions, Repnik  said.</p>

			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LANCASTER COUNCIL RACE DROPS TO 16 CANDIDATES  </P> <P> The field of candidates seeking three Lancaster City Council seats has narrowed  from 18 to 16 after two would-be contenders failed to submit enough valid  petition signatures to qualify for the April 10 ballot, a city official said  Friday.  </P> <P> City Clerk Carla Johnson said Mike Dansand, a 63-year-old retired engineer, and  Barbara Kent, a 19-year-old restaurant employee, came up short of the  requirement that candidates submit signatures of 20 people registered to vote  in the city.  </P> <P> Their failure to qualify still left 16 candidates, the most in years, seeking  the three at-large council seats. Mayor Lynn Harrison and Councilman Els Groves  did not seek reelection, leaving two vacant seats. Councilman Arnie Rodio filed  to keep his seat for a second term.  </P> <P> Johnson said the two would-be candidates were disqualified after a check showed  Dansand with only 18 valid signatures and Kent with only 15. Each had  signatures from people who were not registered to vote, who were not registered  at their current address or who lived outside the city.  </P></p>

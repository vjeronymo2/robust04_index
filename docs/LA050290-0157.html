			<p><P> May 2, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> MANDELA AIDE CHARGED IN DEATH  </P> <P> Winnie Mandela's chief bodyguard during the imprisonment of her husband Nelson  was charged in court today with murdering a teen-age activist.  </P> <P> Jerry Richardson, 41, trainer of the self-styled Mandela United Football Club,  pleaded not guilty to the 1988 killing of 14-year-old Stompie Seipei, whose  death caused a furor around Winnie Mandela and her entourage.  </P> <P> Richardson's appearance in the Supreme Court in Johannesburg came after the  case had been repeatedly postponed for over a year.  </P> <P> Winnie Mandela has said her associates removed Seipei and three other youths  from a Methodist-run shelter in Soweto township in December, 1988, to protect  them from sexual abuse by a white priest -- an allegation rejected by the  church.  </P> <P> The boy, a well-known political activist in his own right, was found dead in a  ditch, his throat slit, the following month.  </P></p>

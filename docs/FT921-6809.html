			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Philippine group in Dollars 28m GDR plan AYALA Corporation, a leading Philippine property-based conglomerate, plans to launch a global depository receipt (GDR) programme worth about Dollars 28m. The company said it will offer 34m class B common shares as GDRs in March. The GDRs will be offered in Hong Kong, London and New York. Lead underwriters for the offering are Salomon Brothers and Baring Brothers. Ayala is the holding company of one of the Philippines' largest conglomerates, whose interests span property development, food production, banking and insurance. In announcing the GDR programme yesterday, Ayala said its unaudited consolidated net income for 1991 was about 2.1bn pesos (Dollars 87m). Ayala Land, the property developer in the group and one of the most actively traded stocks on the local exchanges, sold 96m of its class B common stock in July 1991, the main portion of which went to the international market. Its unaudited net income of 800m pesos for 1991 exceeded by about 26m pesos projections made during its offering period last year.</p>

			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Moscow reformer criticises US stance A close aide to Mr Yegor Gaidar, Russia's first deputy prime minister and the country's chief reformer, yesterday criticised the US administration for 'populistic' statements which suggested that the reform course associated with Mr Gaidar should be relaxed. Mr Vladimir Mau, a long-time associate, strongly reiterated Mr Gaidar's determination to continue - and to deepen - the reform course with which he is associated. He said that Mr Gaidar's future participation in the Russian government would depend on the government's commitment to radical measures. He was speaking the day after President Boris Yeltsin said Mr Gaidar would stay in the government and the reform course would continue. 'We do believe that any slowing down in the pace of reform could make the situation worse in the immediate future,' Mr Mau said. He said that the remarks made by US Vice President Al Gore suggesting International Monetary Fund insensitivity to Russian realities, and those made by Mr Strobe Talbott, special ambassador with responsibility for the Soviet Union, saying that the US administration was not committed to any particular brand of reforms, were beside the point. 'We have no particular problems with the IMF's position,' said Mr Mau. 'The main problem we have with the western countries is restrictions on our exports.' Mr Mau said that the reformers 'have paid a very heavy political price in the elections for their policies. It would be silly not to use the time now to continue these reforms, by throwing them away for some other policies which would not address the real problems.' The vital issue, he said, was the continuing support of the president. The parliament's lower house, or State Duma - where reformist parties are in a minority - could only block measures if a two-thirds majority could be mobilised against them. However, he warned that the two other reformist parties, the Yabloko group led by Mr Grigory Yavlinsky and the Party of Unity and Accord led by Mr Sergei Shakhrai, 'might oppose some specific reforms'. In that case, Mr Gaidar's Russia's Choice group, which has at most 103 deputies out of 450, might find itself without the necessary third of the votes to block a motion against the government.</p>

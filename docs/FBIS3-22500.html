Deputy Health Minister Farid Ariffin said this was due to  the  significant increase in public awareness of Acquired Immunity  Defeciency Syndrome (AIDS) and HIV, among Malaysians.    "Most people are now beginning to take precautions to avoid  being infected as many are more aware about the disease now than  they were a couple of years ago."    To date, Farid said, the number of those tested positive for  HIV was about 7,400.    He said almost all Malaysians above the age of 15 were aware  about the disease.    He said this included those living in the rural and remote  areas and even intravenous dadah [drug] addicts who were still  by far the largest group identified as having AIDS or HIV.    "Despite their awareness about the disease, most drug  addicts  continue to share hypodermic needles to inject themselves with  dadah and seem to be more obsessed with getting a `kick' than  fear of getting AIDS or dying."    Farid was speaking after the opening of a counselling  seminar  organised by the Islah Counselling Unit of the Penang branch of  the Malaysian Association of Jamaah Islah (JIM) here.

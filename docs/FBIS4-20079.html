			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] In an article in the 16 April Athens  daily ELEVTHEROTIPIA, Pavlos Nathanail quotes an unidentified,  "well-known" Albanian intellectual as saying that "the Greek  minority [in Albania] is useful, because it includes progressive  elements that contribute to the country's development." However,  the intellectual is further quoted as saying that "the  difficulty is that some of them are influenced by extremists in  Athens." There are many moderate Albanians who espouse these  views in private, Nathanail continues. At this time, the problem  of Greek Albanians is beginning to be of concern to both Europe  and the United States because it is one of the foci of crisis in  the Balkans, as demonstrated by the recent border incident in  which allegedly Greek masked gunmen raided an Albanian guard  post. While the Greek Government stresses its wish to improve  bilateral relations with Albania to improve the condition of  ethnic Greeks, the existence of extremist elements in both  countries can seriously undermine this effort at rapprochement,  Nathanail comments. Regardless of their ideological stance,  Albanian President Berisha and Prime Minister Mexi would like to  solve the country's economic problems with the assistance of  countries that do not have direct differences or common borders  with Albania. Given the Albanians' traditional suspicion that  Slavs and Greeks have territorial ambitions against them, they  believe that such assistance must necessarily come from other  large countries such as the United States first, followed by  Turkey and Italy, even at the cost of certain disadvantages,  Nathanail writes. As a result, he continues, Washington is  expanding its penetration of Albania, as is Turkey, since  two-thirds of the Albanian population are Muslims. Based on the  above, it is impossible to be optimistic for the immediate  future of Greek-Albanian relations, Nathanail writes, pointing  out that according to experts from the Greek Center of  International Studies, bilateral relations will worsen before  entering a far-off period of relaxation when Albania realizes  only Greece can save its economy. Until such time, he says, the  Greek minority must survive to be able to play its historical  role.</p>

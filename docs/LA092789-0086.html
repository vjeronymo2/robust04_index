			<p><P> September 27, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REINER ON GANGS  </P> <P> More double-talk and equivocation by Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner (Metro, Sept. 20).  </P> <P> He starts out talking firm and strong, " . . . Prosecutors will stop routinely  plea-bargaining with gang members." But the article ends with a wimp, " . . .  R. Dan Murphy, Reiner's director of special operations, conceded that there  still will be cases where there is no option but to plea-bargain."  </P> <P> Typical Reiner nonsense.  </P> <P> Furthermore, it is misleading for him to use the term "plea-bargain." A limit  or "lid" on the length of the county jail or state prison sentence is the  practical result of all these negotiated sentences. Thus, a more accurate term  would be "sentence-bargaining."  </P> <P> RICHARD P. WINSTON  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

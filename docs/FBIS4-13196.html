			<p>BFN     [Text] The negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians  are continuing in Cairo today. Today's talks revolve around the  release of the Palestinian detainees. A member of the  Palestinian delegation said Israel has agreed to release all the  detainees, including Hamas members, adding that the main  argument revolves around the timetable for their release.    Our envoy in Cairo Moti Amir was told by a Palestinian  source  that Egypt will open a quasi-consulate in Jericho which will  serve the residents of the Palestinian autonomous areas until an  independent Palestinian state is established. According to the  source, the consulate will be located in a building belonging to  the Coptic church, upon the approval of the head of the Coptic  church in Egypt.</p>

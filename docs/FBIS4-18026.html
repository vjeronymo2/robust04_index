			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Rudolf Gladkikh] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 28 TASS -- Russia's Federation Council  sent an appeal to President Boris Yeltsin on Thursday, approving  his address to the Federal Assembly on strengthening the Russian  state and basic guidelines of the domestic and foreign policy.    The appeal said that the council has thoroughly studied the  address and "welcomes the president's will" to "continue the  course of reform." It said "We consider the memorandum of civic  peace and accord as an important step towards implementing the  president's address."    The Federation Council supported Yeltsin's proposals to set  up a joint constitutional commission and a joint working group  to coordinate and increase the effectiveness of law-making in  Russia.    The upper house also supported other initiatives and  proposals outlined by the president in his address.    "Stressing our strong agreement with the spirit and the  letter of the address, the Federation Council appeals to the  president and the Government of the Russian Federation with an  urgent request to ensure strict observance of the provisions and  norms of the popularly-adopted Constitution of the Russian  Federation, the federation treaty and Russian laws, and create  favourable conditions for unswerving implementation of these  provisions and norms," the appeal said.</p>

			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC: T.S.O.L.;  </P> <P> OF LOST LABELS;  </P> <P> INSPIRED BY THE GERMS, JOE WOOD FORMED HIS OWN BAND, WHICH HAS BEEN THROUGH SIX  RECORD LABELS, 10 ALBUMS AND SOME STYLE CHANGES.  </P> <P> T.S.O.L. spelled backwards is "lost," as in lost their record label.  </P> <P> That's nothing new for this hard-rocking outfit that has 10 albums on six  different labels, but is now temporarily unsigned. That situation probably  won't last too long since T.S.O.L. (originally known as True Sounds of Liberty)  is one of the most popular L.A. bands.  </P> <P> "Well, we were on Enigma," vocalist-guitarist Joe Wood said in a recent phone  interview. "But that doesn't matter anymore -- it's all over for them. They're  out of business. A lot of labels have expressed interest in signing us; we're  just waiting for the best deal."  </P> <P> Wood is clearly unconcerned. Rock 'n' roll is what T.S.O.L. has been doing for  a number of years and, judging from the size of the crowds, their future seems  secure.  </P> <P> "I decided to become a musician when I saw The Germs play at The Masque in L.A.  in 1978 or 1979. I figured if they can do it, I can, too. I started my own band  the very next day."  </P> <P> For the first 10 years, T.S.O.L. was a punk band. Today, the members are these  rock 'n' roll leather guys, a sort of AC/DC with a touch of the blues.  </P> <P> "I guess the band used to be more image-conscious, but not any more," Wood  said. "We're just a rock 'n' roll band. All those stupid categories, who cares?  Before, people thought we were punkers; now we're supposed to be metal. People  like to put bands into categories -- and we're in a metal box now, but we're  really nothing but a rock 'n' roll band . . . when we play, we just get up and  do a nice sweaty set."  </P> <P> Wood has this loud, gritty voice that sounds as though he's inflicting grievous  damage to his throat; perhaps he's just earning enough money for a down payment  on a voice box when he finally does blow a hole in his neck from too much rock  'n' roll. Come to think of it, Wood sounds a lot like the lead screamer in  AC/DC, only a bit mellower.  </P> <P> "I've done five T.S.O.L. albums in six years," Wood said. "Our latest album,  'Strange Love,' is doing very well -- it's our best yet."  </P> <P> T.S.O.L. crowds can be a little -- what's the word -- rambunctious. The slam  pit will be slamming -- that's when young males crash into each other really  hard, and girls had better be tough or watch out. It's not at all like the  Charleston contest in "It's a Wonderful Life" when members of the opposite sex  actually danced together.  </P> <P> A flak jacket would be appropriate for this show. William James wrote about the  "Moral Equivalent of War"; this could be the "Musical Equivalent of War."  </P> <P> "People's expectations of what they think we should be doing can be pretty bad  sometimes," Wood said. "We've been around for a long time, and I do at least  one song off every album that I've been on. I don't do stuff that the other  singer did. That's his stuff, and I don't do his stuff.  </P> <P> "That's not just my attitude, but how the whole band feels. Anyway, when we  play, people call out songs for us to do. If I did one, then I'd have to do  another, and it would never end. Some of these people just come to have a  miserable time. Some of these people just haven't grown with the band -- it's  not 1981 anymore. I think music is the purest, most direct, most expressive  form of communication. We just pick up our guitars and play. That's all there  is to it. Whatever comes out, comes out."  </P> <P> T.S.O.L. will play Tuesday night at the Carnaval Club in Santa Barbara, a venue  they frequent. "We like it up there," Wood said. "This will just be a one-shot  deal -- we'll play, then drive home to L.A. after the gig. We've already done  three U.S. tours this year; then we try to play a couple times a month around  Southern California."  </P> <P> The future for the band is pretty easy to predict: more hard-edged rock 'n'  roll, more leather and more albums.  </P> <P> "We'd like to open for ZZ Top or AC/DC and do a national tour," Wood said. "For  now, we just want to reach as many people as possible with our music, but never  compromise our principles. I want to just write what I want to. We're doing OK,  better than the Rams -- they're hurtin'."  </P> <P> </P> <P> WHERE AND WHEN  </P> <P> T.S.O.L will be performing on Tuesday at 9 p.m. at the Carnaval Club, 634 State  St., Santa Barbara. This is a show for 18-year-olds and older. Tickets are $12.  For more information, call (805) 965-8422.  </P></p>

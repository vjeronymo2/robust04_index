Statutory Authority <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), as amended in 1986, requires EPA to promulgate national primary drinking water regulations (NPDWRs) which specify maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) or treatment techniques for drinking water contaminants (42 U.S.C. 300g&hyph;1). NPDWRs apply to public water systems (42 U.S.C. 300f(1)(A)). According to section 1401(1)(D) of the Act, NPDWRs include ``criteria and procedures to assure a supply of drinking water which dependably complies with such maximum contaminant levels; including quality control and testing procedures. *&blank;*&blank;*'' In addition, Section 1445(a) of the Act authorizes the Administrator to establish regulations for monitoring to assist in determining whether persons are acting in compliance with the requirements of the SDWA. EPA's promulgation of analytical methods is authorized under these sections of the SDWA as well as the general rulemaking authority in SDWA Section 1450(a) (42 U.S.C. 300j&hyph;9(a)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Regulatory Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA has promulgated analytical methods for all currently regulated drinking water contaminants for which MCLs or monitoring requirements have been promulgated. In most cases, the Agency has promulgated regulations specifying (i.e., approving) use of more than one analytical method for a contaminant, and laboratories may use any one of them for determining compliance with an MCL or monitoring requirement. After any regulation is published, EPA may amend the regulations to approve additional methods, or modifications to approved methods, or withdraw methods that become obsolete. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On December 15, 1993, EPA proposed to approve the use of several new methods and modifications of existing methods that EPA believed were as good as, or better than, current methods and procedures (58 FR 65622). The Agency also proposed to withdraw approval for outdated methods or outdated versions of the same methods. In addition, EPA published a Notice of Availability (NOA) (59 FR 35891) on July 14, 1994, to make available data from EPA's evaluation of several new analytical methods, and to propose withdrawal of approval for several outdated EPA methods. EPA requested public comments on the proposal and on the NOA. Today's notice takes final action on the methods covered by the proposal and the NOA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Explanation of Today's Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With a few minor exceptions, which are described below, the actions described in the 1993 proposed rule and the 1994 NOA are approved in today's rule. The coliform transit time will remain at 30 hours, and the Agency will not require systems to hold samples at 10  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C during transit. EPA will approve the Colisure test for simultaneously determining the presence of total coliforms and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> E. coli. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

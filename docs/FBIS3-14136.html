Yasir Shuraydi, 34, who was also on trial for murders and  other crimes committed in Lebanon, said he was not in West  Berlin when Mustafa al-'Ashiq, a former Libyan diplomat, was  gunned down in 1984.    The Palestinian worked at the Libyan Embassy in East Berlin  from 1982 until he left Germany in 1989 to return to Lebanon.  Under Lebanese law, he can also be tried for crimes committed  abroad.    He also denied any involvement in the April 5, 1986 bombing  of the La Belle discotheque in West Berlin frequented by US  troops. But Lebanese authorities have not charged him in  connection with that attack.    Three people were killed and 230 others wounded in the  bombing, which Washington blamed on Libya. Ten days later US  bombers blasted the headquarters of Libyan leader Mu'ammar  al-Qadhdhafi in Tripoli.    Shuraydi said the Germans suspected him of involvement in  the  bombing because "I am a Palestinian."    He had tried to recruit volunteers in Germany in 1982 to  fight the Israeli Army which invaded Lebanon that year, he said.    Ghassan Ayyub, another Palestinian suspect in the murder of  al-'Ashiq, said he had never known the Libyan, stressing that he  had gone to Germany in 1984 seeking political asylum.    He fled Germany after the murder because a friend showed him  a newspaper report which linked him and Shuraydi with  al-'Ashiq's murder. The report was accompanied by photographs  of both Palestinians, he added.    After hearing the two men for about an hour the court  adjourned until April 19, when a verdict is expected to be  announced.    Germany has demanded Shuraydi's extradition but there is no  such agreement between Beirut and Bonn.    Under Lebanese law a foreigner living in Lebanon can be  tried  for a crime committed in this country or abroad and any  extradition measure can only be decided by the cabinet after a  verdict is pronounced.    Shuraydi, who along with Ayyub come from the 'Ayn al-Hulwah  Palestinian refugee camp on the eastern outskirts of the port  city of Sidon, was arrested by the Lebanese authorities in 1991  in connection with a string of murders, attempted murder and  burglaries.</p>

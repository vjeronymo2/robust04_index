			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Outdoors: Broken finger, broken vehicle - FT Ski Expedition Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are trying to ski every day of 1994 on a round-the-world expedition. They are now near the Chile-Argentina border. As we swooped low over the smouldering furnace in the crater of the Villarrica volcano, a huge swirling cloud of sulphurous smoke billowed towards us: our Cessna felt as vulnerable as a model aircraft made of balsa wood and glue. We circled the crater four or five times until, in a near trance-like state we seemed to be on the verge of being sucked into it. But Robert Stanton, our pilot, had flown over this volcano many times and was as cool as Biggles. Stanton had flown south to meet us to deliver essential documents to enable us to cross the border from Chile into Argentina in the four-wheel-drive Lada vehicle we had borrowed from him. Before flying home, he offered to take us for a buzz over Villarrica. This was infinitely more exciting than experiencing the volcano on skis: like so many Chilean ski areas, Villarrica's skiing was severely restricted by lack of snow. Ski resorts in the Chilean Lake District receive considerable moisture in their snow from winds blowing across the lakes. Lift towers can become so encrusted with ice from freezing rain blowing in from Lake Villarrica that the weight can bring them down. The wind was especially violent during our last morning there: the door of the Lada hit my hand with such force that my middle finger is now in a splint, feared broken. Ronald Turner, the general manager at the Club Esqui Andino in Antillanca, surveyed his resort and said: 'These winds make it impossible to operate the lifts. This is rather a disastrous start to the season which is short enough at the best of times.' When at last the winds dropped we were able to ski Antillanca at will, floating, cruising and drifting down rippling gullies and around huge craters, marvelling at the most spectacular scenery we have seen in Chile so far: the bizarrely beautiful Puntiagudo almost shoulder to shoulder with the Fuji-like Osorno volcano; and the triple-peaked Mount Tronador. But our elation evaporated as our adopted vehicle broke down in the middle of the night in the wilderness. Fortunately, although we were miles from a village, we were close to a Chilean border post. The border post is kept at the ready in case of tensions with Argentina, and horses are best suited to this mountain terrain. We had been rescued by the Chilean cavalry. Being rescued on horseback would have been more dramatic, but the cavalry had transport to get the Financial Times expedition to safe quarters, to ponder how we were to cross into Argentina with a stricken Russian vehicle.</p>

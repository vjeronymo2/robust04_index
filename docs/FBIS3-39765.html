After the talks, which the prime minister held with Russian  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and German Foreign Minister  Klaus Kinkel, Deputy Minister to Prime Minister Tilemakhis  Khitiris made the following statement to correspondents:    [Begin Khitiris recording] The prime minister today received  Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev and discussed the situation in  Bosnia. The prime minister expressed Greece's positions, and I  would say that there was agreement concerning the solution of  the Bosnian problem, which should be a political solution.    Then the prime minister received Mr. Kinkel, the German  foreign minister, and discussed the [EU] presidency issues. Mr.  Kinkel said that Germany supports Greece in the presidency, the  measures it is taking or intends to adopt. The question of the  latest measures on Skopje was also raised for discussion and the  prime minister had the opportunity to outline in detail the  reasons for these measures, which are a Greek move in [words  indistinct]. Mr. Kinkel expressed his understanding, although  he has reservations on this issue.    I believe that they were two very important meetings, if one  takes into consideration the current, previous, and upcoming  events. [end recording] [passage omitted]</p>

As expected, the file on the  interior minister will be sent to the relevant court, but  without any requests of any kind and no inclusion on the list of  investigatees. This was officially announced by Judge Ettore  Torri: "The initial request to shelve the case has been  accepted," the prosecuting attorney said at the end of a meeting  yesterday afternoon, which was surprisingly not attended by the  head of the capital's judicial authorities, Vittorio Mele.    Both Mele, through his absence, and the others, by means of  this measure -- which has already been challenged by the  Attorney General's Office -- intended to make it clear that they  plan to pass on this hot potato without even touching it. It is  a way of washing their hands of it, but also an attempt to defer  matters at least until the elections and averting the  resignation of a minister. Their success in this is not  altogether certain because the investigation is not yet  complete, and indeed it seems to have been resumed at full  speed, with implications that are being described as "very  important."    Yesterday Sabrina Broccoletti, daughter of the intelligence  officer at the center of the scandal, was arrested by  carabinieri. General Nunzella's carabinieri, who have been  conducting the inquiry from the outset, presented a  sequestration warrant signed by Assistant Prosecuting Attorney  Michele Coiro for the seizure of the red-hot tapes recorded in  the Sisde offices (apparently including crucial conversations  between Broccoletti and the major protagonists of the case, from  "tsarina" Martucci to Di Pasquale and Malpica himself) that the  girl was about to hand over to the lawyer, Nino Marazzita, as  reported by the press and television over the past few days.  Broccoletti will discuss these tapes tomorrow, Wednesday, with  the ordinary magistrates, since they are unlikely to be  delivered in time for the interview already scheduled for this  morning with the court of ministers.    The magistrates responsible for politicians' crimes will ask  him about the positions of former Interior Ministers Antonio  Gava and Vincenzo Scotti, but obviously, although the Rome  Attorney's Office wants to wash its hands of the affair, it will  also ask the civilian secret service's former administrative  chief to talk about present Interior Minister Mancino. The  court of ministers and the Attorney General's Office officially  protested the conduct of the ordinary magistrates on this point:  In two almost simultaneous letters they informed the judges at  Piazzale Clodio that the forwarding of the file in any case  entails his inclusion on the register and an explicit request to  shelve the case or for further inquiries to be conducted.    "What can I tell you?" Judge Torri told us in this regard.  "If the court of ministers considers our decision mistaken, it  will send the file back to us...." "But was it so difficult for  you to make a request?" we asked. "A request has already been  made," the magistrate replied, "suggesting that the  investigation into Mancino be shelved, but the court is entirely  free to do whatever it wants, since it is the legitimate entity  responsible for penal actions against ministers."    Ettore Torri refused to add much more, despite the fact that  it was he who fought on 12 November to include Mancino on the  register of investigatees, against the wishes of his boss, Mele,  and he now seems resigned to respecting the latest order. The  same goes for Michele Coiro, the other assistant judge who  challenged the extradition request and that seems to have been  in charge of the investigation for some time. Coiro also took  issue publicly with Mele on a couple of occasions, going as far  as to describe his boss as "rather naive" about the business of  including [former Police Chief] Vincenzo Parisi on the register  of investigatees. This could explain Mele's absence from  yesterday afternoon's meeting, which was attended by Attorneys  Leonardo Frisani and Aurelio Galasso, as well as Coiro and Torri.    It was at the end of this meeting that Torri announced the  forwarding of the latest evidence in the Mancino case. On  television channel 3 news he provided a very important  explanation for those acquainted with the secrets of the Sisde  case. Torri explained that the documents forwarded to the court  of ministers include transcripts of the final interviews with  former Sisde Director Riccardo Malpica; his successor,  Alessandro Voci; and their former aides, Maurizio Broccoletti  and Gerardo Di Pasquale.    The importance of this announcement is connected with the  fact that Gerardo Di Pasquale clearly also spoke about Nicola  Mancino's role in the business of the illegal funds. It is not  known what was said by the former head of Sisde's logistics  department, though hitherto his line of defense is close to that  of Broccoletti and company, with the sole exception of Michele  Finocchi, the last of the people questioned in this case, who is  less willing to incriminate his superiors and politicians.    As for the interviews with Malpica and Voci, there have  already been several disclosures, according to which their  accounts coincide with regard to the role of former Police Chief  Parisi, of the interior minister's former private secretary  Lauro, and of Mancino himself in covering up intelligence  officers involved in the scandal. Evidently the attorney  general decided that these statements did not provide sufficient  grounds for investigating a minister in office.    But Malpica and Voci, two other witnesses, were at the very  summit of the organization at the crucial time being examined by  the investigation, and initially they differed sharply -- so  much so that Voci reported Malpica for having made him supply a  false statement to the magistrates concerning the destination of  the billions of lire taken from Sisde and for having made him  sign false transfer notes relating to the funds. Last, Torri  also explained that no consideration was given to the  possibility of questioning Police Chief Parisi, who was  criticized harshly by the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] in  Naples yesterday for his "undoubted political responsibilities"  during his time as Sisde chief with regard to the Cirillo case,  in a clear reference also to his role in the illegal funds  affair.</p>

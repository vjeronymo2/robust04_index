			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava, March 23 (CTK) -- The Slovak Foreign  Ministry strongly protests against Hungarian pressure on the  international public designed to discredit the contribution of  the Gabcikovo dam to traffic on the Danube, a ministry's  statement published today says.    The statement responds to Tuesday's [22 March] statement by  the Hungarian Government, saying the Slovak Government bears  responsibility for the blockage of the Danube at the  Gabcikovo-Nagymaros hydro-electric power station for  unilaterally redirecting part of the Danube along a derivation  canal on Slovak territory in November 1992.    The Hungarian Government called upon countries supporting  free passage on the Danube to urge Slovakia to "stop its illegal  activities and revive without delay the conditions for traffic."    Ship transport was interrupted due to accidents at the  Gabcikovo dam in southern Slovakia on March 21.    The Slovak statement says there are no international  dimensions of the danger to the power station. By contrast, the  one-year operation of at Gabcikovo confirmed that conditions for  accelerated ship transport along a 42-kilometers route had  improved.    The Foreign Ministry says that Slovak authorities would take  all necessary steps in order to revive international traffic.</p>

			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WE ALL SHARE THE BLAME FOR DECEITFUL ADVERTISING  </P> <P> Bruce Horovitz' column, "Faked Volvo Spot Drives Another Nail Into Ad  Industry's Credibility (Nov. 13)," focuses on the industry's gross deceit. But  is it so gross that we notice? Apparently not.  </P> <P> Most viewers would cynically agree that ads hoodwink the public and only be  vaguely aghast that Volvo, Colgate, Campbell Soup Co., Pepsico and a multitude  of other upstanding firms outright fudged their figures and their film.  </P> <P> The problem is that we are in a system of commerce that has institutionalized  deceit. Both parties -- the public and the advertisers -- know that success is  simply a question of who does the best job of lying, of dressing their puffery  up in a form that we are willing to accept, if not as truth, at least as  representative. Do we know that every price tag that reads $1.99 or $99.99 or  $1,999.99 is a deception? Of course we do, and yet we accept it.  </P> <P> It shouldn't surprise a jaded public that the recent elections were expositions  in obfuscation, omission and fear-mongering mind-mangling. At some point we  simply turn off our mental receivers, shake our heads in disbelief and go back  to complaining about taxes.  </P> <P> The problem is so inbred that even otherwise honest advertisers (is that an  oxymoron?) can't consider swinging back in the direction of truth for fear of  losing market share.  </P> <P> So while Horovitz and the rest of us address the itchy scaly rash, the disease  quietly circulates below the surface, rendering us shallow, distracted and  powerless. To quote Pogo, "We have seen the enemy, and he is us!"  </P> <P> ALLAN RABINOWITZ  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Fund to back private power generation A FUND with a target of Dollars 500m (Pounds 324.6m) has been launched in the US to seek capital from investment institutions for private sector power projects in Latin America. The fund, said to be the first of its kind, has an initial size of Dollars 75m and has been created because more and more governments are turning to the private sector to increase generating capacity. The intention is to invest mainly in the equity of new private sector thermal and hydroelectric power stations and in the privatisation of existing plants in Latin America and the Caribbean. Countries such as Chile, Argentina, Venezuela and Colombia have led the movement to private power generation. Mexico allows the private sector to invest jointly with the public sector, and in Brazil this week Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, economy minister, said the government would go ahead with the sale of power generation assets. Governments are turning to the private sector in an attempt to reduce budget deficits. According to a World Bank study in 1989, state electricity sectors caused a Dollars 2bn deficit in Latin America. In some countries, regular power cuts are affecting growth. Colombia's economy suffered last year from cuts caused in part by a drought which exposed the country's over-dependence on hydroelectric power. The capital needs are huge - estimated by the 1989 World Bank study at Dollars 17bn-Dollars 18bn a year in Latin America alone. There has been a shortage not only of equity, which the new fund will aim to help address, but also of long-term debt. The latter has traditionally been provided for such projects by international financial institutions such as the World Bank and the InterAmerican Development Bank, but they are constrained in their ability to lend to the private sector. Export credit agencies usually provide loans only up to a maximum of 12 years, whereas 20-year or 30-year debt is more appropriate for most power generation projects. Another problem surrounds the region's underdeveloped domestic capital markets. The most advanced is Chile's, but that is only able to provide money up to 15 years. A question mark for investors will be the regulatory regimes imposed on private power generation. Foreign investors will want to ensure a lasting pricing regime, which will not subject electricity prices to political pressure, and to keep foreign exchange risks to a minimum. Mr Luis Luis of Scudder Stevens &amp; Clark, the Boston-based investment management company managing the new fund, said he hoped the fund would stimulate similar financing efforts to provide a pool of capital for private sector power projects. The fund, the Scudder Latin America Trust for Independent Power, will not be the prime sponsor or developer of projects but is meant to provide finance for projects started by others. It starts with three investors committing Dollars 25m apiece: the International Finance Corporation, the private sector affiliate of the World Bank; CMS Energy, a Michigan-based energy company which owns Michigan's largest utility; and Minneapolis-based NRG Energy, the owner of Northern States Power. The three will act as advisers to the fund, which is available to institutional investors.</p>

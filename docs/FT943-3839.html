			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Equity Markets: Analysts still see further rise this year - London In a stock market suddenly under attack on its two most sensitive fronts - interest rate prospects and company trading statements - analysts' nerves appear to be holding up well. The consensus is still that the market has further to advance this year, even if base rates are almost certain to rise and the corporate reporting season has shown it can deliver disappointments as well as delights. The BTR shocker has been a reminder that general manufacturing earnings have not yet regained pre-recession highs and that these sectors had, in any event, a great deal of ground to recover. As Kleinwort Benson points out, and BTR admitted, the sharp drop in global inflation rates bears testimony to 'a stifling pricing environment'. At the same time, costs are threatened by rising raw material prices and pockets of skill shortage. Meanwhile, the absence of dramas following the monthly meeting between the chancellor of the exchequer and the governor of the Bank of England has left the outlook for base rates unchanged. 'UK rates (are) likely to rise by November,' says Goldman Sachs flatly - but then adds that any equity weakness presents a buying opportunity. A similar view is taken by Charterhouse Tilney, where Richard Jeffrey believes higher base rates would be positive for equities by steadying the gilt-edged market. 'At this stage of the recovery, a tightening is not to be feared,' he says. Charterhouse believes company profits have 'significantly' more to benefit from economic recovery. Smith New Court takes this a stage further by insisting the cyclical sectors, construction, chemicals, engineering and building materials companies, have been abandoned too soon by investors fearful recovery may slacken. 'Our view is that the economic upswing will be more prolonged than is generally anticipated and that cyclicals are a long way from peaking out,' the firm says. It believes under-performance by the cyclicals, largely reflecting interest rate worries, overlooks an uptrend in share price relatives of European cyclical stocks. Smith endorses the view of many in London that rate rises are unlikely to reverse these trends. Its argument would also question the knee-jerk rush back towards the defensive sectors - utilities, food manufacturing and healthcare - seen on Friday afternoon. Earnings estimates in those sectors are still on a downturn, and 'outperformance . . . is probably a selling opportunity'. None of this will protect the stock market against further shocks in the near term, either in the shape of more interest rate-threatening statistics from the US or discomforting trading reports from British companies.</p>

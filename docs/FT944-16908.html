			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / UK Company News: No Adviser the magician's rival / A look at the role played by in-house financial teams Ask mergers and acquisitions professionals to name their firm's toughest rival and they reply as if in one voice: 'My biggest competitor is No Adviser.' They mean the in-house team at a potential corporate client which handles deals without calling on, and paying, a financial adviser. If 'no adviser' was included in the M&amp;A league tables, it would soar above the likes of Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and SG Warburg which usually vie for the top positions. Imperial Chemical Industries has perhaps the most active in-house acquisition team. The 'A-team' has handled 600 transactions over the last 10 years. 'We've done more deals than Warburg, Schroders and Goldman Sachs,' says Mr John Dewhurst, group manager of planning and acquisitions. 'We've done more deals than all of them put together.' Mr Dewhurst is convinced of the virtues of the ICI approach. 'We believe we can do everything a merchant bank can do. If you know what you are doing, you can save a lot of money and probably get a better deal.' Some investment bankers concede that in-house teams have advantages. 'They will know exactly what the company wants,' says a UK corporate finance head. 'It's a real headache.' Developing an internal department for corporate development may not be cost-effective for smaller companies; but those the size of ICI, Rhone-Poulenc, Unilever and British Petroleum have found it makes business sense. Last Christmas, when Mr Dewhurst was discussing his annual bonus, he calculated how much ICI would have had to pay had it used external advisers: Pounds 12.5m. ICI pays ICI salaries to the A-team. Mr Dewhurst says the overall cost is vastly less: 'Take off a couple of zeros.' Investment bankers respond that a company gets what it pays for. An in-house team does not have the broad perspective of an investment bank. It is often unfamiliar with sectors outside its core competence. Most companies have to turn outside to arrange financing. Nor can a company handle a flotation or a takeover alone. Lasmo paid Pounds 16m in fees to Schroders, Goldman Sachs and NatWest Markets to fend off the Pounds 1.6bn hostile takeover bid by Enterprise Oil. One investment banker, scoffing at ICI's claims not to use advisers, jokes that the group paid a decade's worth of fees on the demerger of Zeneca. A straightforward 'vanilla' deal with other companies in a sector is another matter. 'We've lived with other chemical companies, we've grown up with them, we measure them,' says Mr Dewhurst. 'Our database is better than an investment bank's' A sizeable multinational also has the resources to finance an individual acquisition internally. That said, few multinationals have followed the ICI approach. More have opted for a halfway house: an in-house corporate development department which farms out work it cannot efficiently do alone. One manifestation is that fees for complex work have held firmer than those for plain 'vanilla' transactions. 'Clients are happy to pay fees when they can see that a banker has added real value,' says Mr Jim Downing, of Lehman Brothers. The head of ICI's A-team tells investment bankers the same thing: 'If you bring something to me and you bring added value then we will pay you for it.' But Mr Dewhurst adds: 'In the last 10 years, with one exception, we haven't paid any merchant bank.' One, after its suggestions had been rejected one time too many, asked: 'Are we wasting our time?' Sanguine bankers maintain there is nothing startling about corporate clients maintaining A-teams. 'I don't think it's a new rash,' says Mr David Verey, chairman of Lazard Brothers, the UK merchant bank. Nevertheless the character of the 1990s' wave of M&amp;A has had an impact. Strategic rather than financial logic is the driving force and core competence rather than diversification the catchword. That does lead companies to dispose of peripheral businesses and usually to make use of an investment bank's wide range of contacts to do so. But when such companies look for targets and alliances they increasingly concentrate on their own sector. The more intimately they know the industry, the less they need financial advisers. Corporate clients are also catching up with the investment banking techniques that once dazzled them. 'People used to say these guys are magicians,' says an M&amp;A specialist at a US investment bank. 'Today you can walk in and find that a company knows more about the market than you do. The more sophisticated the client base has become, the more sophisticated we have had to become.' Most importantly, multinationals have broadened their horizons and are increasingly comfortable with cross-border deals, at least those within their sector and the developed world. 'It would be mad to compete with that,' says Mr Will Samuel, head of corporate finance at J Henry Schroder Wagg, the UK merchant bank. 'We should move to where we can add value.' Investment banks are fleeing forward. Mr Samuel says: 'Investment banking is about competing in areas which are changing rapidly, be they products, countries or industries. BAT Industries provides an illustration. BAT handles most of its acquisitions internally but made an exception for its east European acquisitions, on which it hired Schroders as adviser. In the US and UK, in-house acquisition teams may represent a challenge; but on the Continent investment banks can win clients among companies which have never used financial advisers. 'My biggest competitor may be No Adviser,' says an executive at a US investment bank in London. 'But it is going after that market that is most interesting.'</p>

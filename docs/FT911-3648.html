			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Audit Office faults NHS local autonomy THE NATIONAL Health Service's Pounds 4bn-a-year supplies operation could benefit from management techniques used by companies such as Boots and Marks and Spencer, the National Audit Office says today. An NAO study of the management of complex operations in private-sector companies showed that the NHS's approach differed sharply 'in nearly every respect'. In particular, the NAO report says, none of 16 private companies surveyed 'permitted local autonomy on the scale allowed throughout the NHS'. The report's conclusion that decentralised structures have prevented the NHS from maximising its purchasing efficiency comes when the government's health reforms, introduced this month, are encouraging still more local autonomy in many areas of the health service. The NAO examined how Boots, Marks and Spencer and Compass Services UK, a contract caterer, handled their equivalent of the NHS supplies organisation, which provides hospitals with food, bedding and equipment. Between them the three companies supply about 4,000 delivery points and, the NAO says, 'face similar logistic challenges' as the NHS. In addition, a consultants' report was commissioned on 13 other private companies in manufacturing, food processing and retailing. A fundamental difference between the public and private sectors was the greater emphasis placed by the private companies on central control. They also made greater use of information technology to help manage their supplies operations, and had management information 'on tap', with senior managers exercising close oversight of activities. The report concludes that the NHS supplies organisation 'does not apply financial and commercial disciplines which are common in the private sector'. It demonstrates differences of view between the NAO and the Department of Health over the value of devolving decision-making on purchasing. The NAO says the 'variety of decentralised structures' in the NHS had led to fragmented purchasing, making it unlikely that operating costs would be minimised and purchasing power maximised. The Department of Health argued that decentralised structures offered 'positive advantages such as local accessibility and ownership'. The NAO said the most significant need was for more positive strategic oversight by senior management. Department of Health officials told the NAO that, while recognising some of the points raised, 'private-sector practice was not necessarily appropriate for adoption by the NHS as the businesses were different in many respects'.

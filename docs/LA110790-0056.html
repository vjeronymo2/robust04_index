			<p><P> November 7, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> ELECTIONS: SUPERVISORS;  </P> <P> HOWARD BUILDS SLIM LEAD IN 4TH DISTRICT  </P> <P> After a bitter campaign that literally pitted neighbor against neighbor, Vicky  Howard took a slim early lead Tuesday night over aggressive challenger Bill  Davis in the 4th District supervisorial race.  </P> <P> Howard, 55, outpolled fellow Simi Valley council member and next-door neighbor  Davis in the early returns after a race characterized by personal attacks and  charges of unethical campaigning by both sides.  </P> <P> Howard, who spent the evening at home with friends and family, was cautiously  optimistic about her lead.  </P> <P> "We're not there yet, but we're certainly going in the right direction," she  said. "The lead is so small I wouldn't have any confidence in the numbers right  now."  </P> <P> Davis said he was confident that he was going to win despite the early returns,  "but it's going to be very close. . . . It comes down to the kind of campaign  voters want to see."  </P> <P> Howard and Davis ran tough, bitter campaigns in their struggle to replace  retiring incumbent Jim Dougherty as supervisor for the 4th District, which  includes Simi Valley, Moorpark, Somis and the Santa Clara Valley.  </P> <P> Throughout the campaign, Howard emphasized her extensive government experience.  In addition to her eight years on the City Council, Howard has served four  years on the County Transportation Commission and two years on the Local Agency  Formation Commission.  </P> <P> Davis has served four years on the City Council and one year on the Planning  Commission.  </P> <P> Howard and Davis emerged from a field of five candidates in the June primary to  qualify for a runoff, with Howard collecting 39.6% of the vote to Davis' 25.4%.  </P> <P> In the months that followed, Davis campaigned vigorously to close the gap,  raising nearly $13,000 more in contributions than Howard and hiring a political  consultant to boost his campaign. According to campaign financial statements,  Davis raised $88,112 since January and spent $89,409 in the race. Howard raised  $77,169 and spent $76,150.  </P> <P> For the most part, the two candidates agreed on the issues. Both opposed the  proposed merger of Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric  Co., and both backed a proposal for Simi Valley to annex property owned by  entertainer Bob Hope.  </P> <P> Both have said they are moderate on growth and both have accepted large  contributions from developers.  </P> <P> Simi Valley Mayor Greg Stratton said the primary difference between the two is  Howard's conservative philosophy. He said if push came to shove, Davis would be  more likely to raise taxes, but Howard would cut services.  </P> <P> With little difference on the issues, the candidates focused most of their time  and energy questioning each other's ethics and qualifications for the job.  </P> <P> Davis, a Democrat, and Howard, a Republican, accused each other of misleading  voters by distributing or allowing the distribution of campaign mailers that  were specifically addressed to voters whose party affiliations were different  than their own. The mailers failed to mention the candidates' party  affiliations. Both denied any wrongdoing.  </P> <P> Howard also criticized Davis for initially refusing to authorize release of his  service record as a Culver City police officer more than 40 years ago.  </P> <P> Davis said his personnel record was his own business. He said he served as a  police officer for seven months in 1950 but resigned after witnessing the death  of a young boy hit by a car.  </P> <P> Davis said Howard had known the story for years and was outraged by her attempt  to cast doubts on his credibility. Just days before the election, Davis  announced that he would authorize release of his police record, but Howard  decided not to pursue the issue after Culver City officials said they do not  keep personnel records for more than 25 years.  </P> <P> Howard, who was endorsed by Ventura County Sheriff John V. Gillespie and Dist.  Atty. Michael D. Bradbury, denied knowing the reason why Davis quit the Police  Department.  </P> <P> Ironically, it was Howard who lured Davis into politics 10 years ago,  encouraging him to join a neighborhood council group.  </P> <P> In 1985, Howard recommended Davis for a seat on the city's Planning Commission  and a year later supported his appointment to the City Council.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Christopher Reynolds contributed to this story. Karen McKean  also reported.  </P></p>

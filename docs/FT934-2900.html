			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Cheaper oil holds down US inflation US consumer prices rose 0.2 per cent last month and by 2.7 per cent in the year to November, indicating that the accelerating pace of economic growth is not yet putting much upward pressure on inflation. The rise in the index was restrained by a 1.3 per cent decline in energy costs between October and November, reflecting recent falls in world oil prices. Excluding the volatile components of food and energy, the 'core' consumer price index rose 0.3 per cent, in line with analysts' projections. The annual rate of core inflation was 3.1 per cent. The service sector continues to lag behind other industries in containing inflationary pressures. In the year to November services prices were up 3.6 per cent against 1.5 per cent for goods. Goods-price inflation is being kept in check partly by a strong rebound in US productivity. Revised figures this week showed productivity grew at 4.3 per cent a year in the third quarter, stronger than in previous recoveries.</p>

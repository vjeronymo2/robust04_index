Takemura made the comment at an evening news conference  following the announcement by leaders of ruling coalition  parties to revoke Hosokawa's decision Thursday to impose a 7  percent indirect tax in April 1997.    Takemura said the coalition aims to reach a decision by  Monday at the latest on tax cuts, which are part of a fresh 15  trillion yen pump-priming package.    He said there will be no change for schedules to compile the  state budget for fiscal 1994, noting the Finance Ministry will  unveil a budget plan February 10 and the cabinet will adopt the  final budget plan February 15.</p>

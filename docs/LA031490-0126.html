			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SOUTH COUNTY;  </P> <P> DEMOCRAT INELIGIBLE TO RUN FOR CONGRESS  </P> <P> The only Democratic candidate who filed to run against Rep. Ron Packard  (R-Carlsbad) was declared ineligible Tuesday because he did not submit enough  signatures with his application.  </P> <P> George E. Hollis, an optical engineer, submitted the $1,207 filing fee by the  deadline last Friday, but he was nine signatures short of the number required  to qualify for the race.  </P> <P> The registrar's office said Hollis had 31 valid signatures and the application  requires 40. To be valid, the signatures must be from voters registered within  the district and in the same party as the candidate.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, the Orange County registrar's office completed an audit of the  applications it received on the Friday deadline. There were no other  applications for county, state or federal office that were invalidated.  </P> <P> Hollis was unavailable for comment Tuesday.  </P> <P> Packard's district includes San Juan Capistrano and San Clemente in Orange  County as well as most of northern San Diego County. Besides Packard, there are  two minor party candidates in the race.  </P> <P> Packard, 59, was first elected in 1982 as a write-in. In 1988, he beat Democrat  Howard Greenebaum 72% to 26%.  </P></p>

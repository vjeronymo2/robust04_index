			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Travel: The present catches up in Perigord - Michael Wigan scents change in an idyllic landscape THERE IS a whiff of old cultures, of unchanging lifestyle. There is a sprinkling of tables outside the bar. Sunlight splashes through the tiny square's solitary tree on to the wall of the Romanesque church. Three elderly men are drinking pastis while a small girl complains about the informal address used by visiting English. When a battered car squeals to a halt and an elderly woman exhorts one of the men to come home immediately, the drinkers barely react. The church bell tolls, but time in this part of France stands still. This is a little village in the north part of the Perigord, north Dordogne. Blackening sunflowers decorate sloping fields. Black and white cows strip-graze the rolling landscape, held in by electric fencing. Woods clothe the higher ground; lofty poplars mark out the watercourses. Numerous kestrels, buzzards and a red kite prove the abundance of small mammals. Standing along the roads are apple trees, damsons, walnuts and plums. It is a bumper year and fruit strews the ground; some branches have snapped with the weight. Strips of vegetables - marrows, pumpkins, leeks - fill corners of fields with stunning luxuriance. The cooing of doves never stops. It a landscape of gentle and unspoiled charm. Although new houses do exist, none looks new - the red-tiled roofs and traditionally-shuttered windows see to that. And greenery quickly engulfs the nakedness of invading structures. There is a pronounced peacefulness. It is hard to believe that in a well-known part of Europe in late summer you can wander down the country lanes and loop-roads to farms for two hours without seeing a car, but it is true. The best way to snoop about would be by bicycle, pedalling through the fruit-scented air. The odd earthen rump of an Iron Age fort, or statuesquely isolated Roman ruin proves that this is a land peopled for a long time, sometimes over-run but never essentially changed. For the inhabitants are ancient agriculturists who do things in time-tested ways. Because it is in their nature, and because history has shown the usefulness of it, they are largely self-sustaining. In the ramshackle barn behind the cottage a crated sow lay with 13 piglets in a heap at her teats. A calf was born that morning. Beneath the fruit trees and vines hens and ducks, sometimes an assortment of sheep and donkeys, cleaned up the ground. Every building has the high-up square holes of a dovecot. Fishing is a public right, and for a nominal fee you can try for trout, perch, carp or pike. The green, slow, murky waters are alive with aquatic carnivores. The French here are avid hunters, and the few rabbits are noticeably wary. I found it fascinating to inspect the careful provisioning in farmers' backyards. Each house has a woodstack, all cut to the same length, presumably for the same type of woodstove. Brushwood and kindlings are stacked alongside, the whole long arrangement roofed with rushes. Scything, hoeing, weeding, forking hay, cutting wood, puffing along on their antiquated tractors, countryfolk were always working at something, the men under the watchful eye of the women working close by. The whole appearance of the land betokens unceasing toil and husbandry. Buildings which would otherwise slide to their knees are propped and fastened upright and held together by any means, if necessary by stacking straw bales high enough to support the roof. The newly-fledged EC farm regulations on health, hygiene and worker safety, which have closed many British smallholders, would, if ever applied in an area like this, close down this sort of agriculture over hundreds of miles. Here lies the problem. An officious EC inspector would be tossed into the slurry-pit if he ever poked his nose into this time-defying part of the Perigord. But the issue goes further than that. For the British traveller, or the British emigrant (thousands have moved there, and billboards for property sales are in English), the old-fashioned way of life and heart-rendingly pretty countryside are the attraction. It is what cannot be had any longer in much of England: a slow pace, a pastoral idyll. But it is also what EC taxpayers are spending large sums to preserve - a transmission of funds to the rural economy that protects continental farmers from the chill wind of macro-economic agriculture in countries such as New Zealand, Australia, Canada and the US. The Napoleonic laws of succession which subdivided landholdings equally between children are being forced into reverse by economic circumstances. Farms are getting bigger. Country villages have fewer young people. The revolution in farming structures which Britain so painfully underwent in the 1960s and 1970s is starting here. For years the co-operative system - and politicians determined to hold on to their rural votes - held international forces at bay. Now farmers are opting for early retirement, or set-aside, or are going bankrupt. The sunflower crop, to take a significant example, is worth a quarter of what it was five years ago. Farmland, like its crops, is almost valueless. This goes some way to explain why desperate French farmers incinerate or spoil food imports from their neighbours which undercut their prices. They are not just bolshy; they face extinction. What price picturesqueness?</p>

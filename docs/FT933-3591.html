			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / California tax changes likely to lift UK retaliation threat CALIFORNIAN tax legislation passed at the weekend is expected to lift the threat of British action against Californian-based companies operating in the UK. However, the bill, which was approved in the California state assembly late Friday night, as yet leaves unresolved the court battle by Barclays Bank against the state's unitary tax system. Barclays' action is the test case for suits which could cost California a total of about Dollars 880m (Pounds 570m). Another Dollars 3.1bn is at stake in a related suit brought by Colgate-Palmolive, which would extend to US-owned companies. The new legislation is likely to remove the principal remaining objections of foreign-owned companies to the state's tax system, which they argue has discriminated against them, and leave them free to choose an alternative system of tax assessment known as 'water's edge'. Foreign, and especially British, companies have long objected to California's unitary system, which taxes a company on a percentage of its worldwide income, rather than only on income earned in the state. Since this system differs from international norms, it can be disallowed by tax authorities in other countries and lead to a company's being taxed twice on the same income. Due to international pressure, California has since 1988 allowed companies to opt for 'water's edge' assessment, which includes only activities within the US. In the UK, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is not expected to make a statement until the Treasury has studied the bill, but US officials are confident the legislation does enough to justify the lifting of the retaliation threat. The retaliation, announced in May, is due to come into effect on January 1. It would remove a tax credit from Californian companies, effectively increasing the tax rate on their UK subsidiaries from 28 per cent to 33 per cent, costing them up to Pounds 250m a year. Major US companies have lobbied California hard to change its law and avert the UK retaliation. UK finance directors yesterday welcomed the legislation's approval, but cautiously. ICI, which has extensive interests in California, said: 'This move is broadly welcome but we are looking at the new arrangements to see whether they remove all our concerns.' Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, said: 'The Californian legislature has passed a bill which, although it does not totally repeal unitary tax provisions, positively improves the tax code in the way the CBI has been advocating.'</p>

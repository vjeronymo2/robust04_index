			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Fathi 'Abd-al-Baqi, tax authority chairman, </F> by 'Ala'-al-Din Mustafa; place and date not given]    [Text] Now that unified tax law No. 187 of 1993 has been  promulgated, its provisions will go into effect as of 1 January  1994. A major question arises here: How will this law apply to  wages and the like?    AKHIR SA'AH has interviewed Muhammad Fathi 'Abd-al-Baqi,  first undersecretary of the Ministry of Finance and Tax  Authority chairman, and addressed to him this and other  important questions: What are taxable revenues? What are the  exemptions listed by the law? What about pensions? The interview  has asked these and numerous other questions.    To start, Fathi 'Abd-al-Baqi pointed out that the unified  tax  law will be implemented as of January 1994. This law was issued  to amend some provisions of income tax law No. 157 of 1981. With  the promulgation of the unified tax law, the general income tax,  with all its pros and cons, has been abolished. Moreover, the  unified tax has alleviated the tax burden for employees. An  employee with a gross income from his job amounting to 800  pounds monthly will not be subject to any tax, meaning that  nearly 9,600 pounds will not be taxable.    Moreover, pensioners will not be subject to the tax.  'Abd-al-Baqi also pointed out that the executive regulations  will be issued within three months as of the date of publication  of the law in the Official Gazette.    [Mustafa] How will the income tax on salaries and the like  be  calculated under the unified tax law?    ['Abd-al-Baqi] The Tax Authority has issued circular No. 1  of  1994 on the provisions governing salaries and the like in law  No. 187 of 1993, which amends some provisions of the income tax  law promulgated by law No. 157 of 1981. The circular states that  the provisions of this law shall apply to salaries and the like  as of 1 January 1994.    As for applying provisions of the law, this law has  maintained all the objective and executive regulations and  procedures enacted in the income tax law promulgated by law No.  157 of 1981 on salaries and the like, adding to them the  following:     -  Law No. 187 of 1993 treats non-shareholder members and  chairmen of the executive boards of the public business sector  companies the same as members and chairman of executive boards  of public sector companies, subjecting the salaries and bonuses  they receive to the provisions governing salaries and the like  in accordance with paragraph 4 of article 49. Meanwhile, the law  treats shareholder chairmen and members the same as chairmen and  members of executive boards of private sector joint-stock  companies, subjecting their salaries, bonuses, and the like to  the provisions of the "movable capital revenues" in accordance  with the stipulation of paragraph 11 of article 6. The law also  subjects salaries and the like collected by commissioned  executive board chairmen and members to the provisions governing  "salaries and the like," up to 5,000 pounds and in accordance  with the conditions and rules established in paragraph 5 of  article 49. Any sum in excess of 5,000 pounds will be subjected  to the tax on the movable capital revenues.    -  It has included in the tax vessel any hazardous work  allowance  exceeding 480 pounds, not 240 pounds, and any representation  allowance exceeding 2,500 pounds, not 3,000 pounds.    -  The law releases completely the exemption established for the  wages of daily workers, provided that they are not employed  permanently and that they have no source of income other than  their daily wages.    -  It establishes for wage earners and the like a personal  exemption of 2,000 pounds annually, plus the 10-percent  deduction established for earning the income.    -  It establishes a new exemption for free or reduced-price  tickets given by transportation companies, whether airlines or  maritime companies, [to their workers].    -  The law exempts wage earners from submitting the annual tax  statement stipulated in article 91 for wages and the like. It  also exempts them from listing such salaries and the like in the  said statement, even if they have other income elements, such as  commercial and industrial activity revenues and real estate  wealth revenues.    -  It raises the exemption limit established by law No. 157 of  1981 for family burdens, increasing it as follows in accordance  with article 88:    1. A total of 1,440 pounds annually for a single taxpayer.    2. A total of 1,680 pounds annually for a married person who  supports no children or an unmarried person who supports one or  more children.    3. A total of 1,920 pounds annually for a married person  supporting one or more children.  <H5>  New Provisions </H5>   The law has also added the following provisions:     -  It has raised the maximum age of a dependent son or  daughter to 28 years, if the dependent is a student in any  educational phase, regardless of whether university education or  otherwise.    -  It considers either parent a dependent if the taxpayer is  actually their sole supporter.       The law has also made the following taxable:     -  Sums paid to foreign experts employed for no more than 183  days annually, regardless of whether consecutive or interspersed  days.    -  Sums collected by taxable employees from parties other than  their original employers, as stipulated in article 52.    In both cases, the tax applies to these sums without any  deduction, whether for living or family burdens. The tax rate  will be 20 percent for any sums up to 50,000 pounds and 32  percent for any sums in excess of 50,000.  <H5>  Taxable Revenues </H5>   [Mustafa] What revenues are taxable?    ['Abd-al-Baqi] Article 49 of the law defines them clearly.  The tax applies to the following revenues:     -  Salaries and the like, wages, bonuses, and lifelong  revenues, excluding insurance dues, which are paid to any  person, regardless of whether living in Egypt or abroad, by the  Egyptian Government, by local government units, by public  authorities and other public persons, and by funds governed by  law No. 54 of 1975, issuing the private insurance funds law, and  by law No. 64 of 1980 concerning alternative private social  security funds.    -  Salaries and the like, wages, bonuses, and lifelong revenues,  "excluding pensions," paid by private companies, establishments,  and organizations and by educational institutes and individuals  to any person living in Egypt and to any person living abroad  for services rendered in Egypt.    -  Salaries and bonuses of chairmen and members of public sector  companies' executive boards.    -  Salaries and bonuses of non-shareholder chairmen and members  of  executive boards of public business sector companies.    -  Sums collected for administrative work by:    A. Executive board chairmen and members commissioned to join  the executive boards of private sector joint-stock companies,  provided that their contribution to the company capital doesn't  exceed the limit set as a condition for executive board  membership.    B. Directors of private sector joint-stock companies whose  contribution to the company capital doesn't exceed the limit  required by the law for executive board membership.    Under all circumstances, it is conditional that no more than  four persons defined by name in each company shall benefit from  this provision, and only within the limits of 5,000 pounds  annually per person, regardless of whether the sum is a fixed  sum, a percentage of the net profit, or something else.  <H5>  Settlement of Taxes Due </H5>   (Fathi 'Abd-al-Baqi added) as for the revenues included in  the tax vessel, they are defined by the following articles:    Article 50. Revenues included in the tax vessel shall be  determined for every part of the year in which any taxable  revenue is obtained according to the duration of this part and  on the basis of the monthly revenue, after it is converted into  annual revenue.    In case change occurs in the taxable revenue, the  calculation  of this revenue shall be amended as of the date of the change on  the basis of the new revenue, after it is converted into annual  revenue.    As for accrued salaries and the like, wages, and bonuses  that  are paid in a lump sum in a certain year, the accrued sum shall  be divided over the accrual years, the revenues included in the  tax vessel shall be recalculated for each year, and taxes due  shall be settled on this basis.    Article 51. Excluding the stipulation of paragraph 8 of  article 6 of this law, taxable revenues shall be determined in  the manner shown below on the basis of the total salaries,  wages, recompense, bonuses, allowances, lifelong  revenues--excluding pensions--and cash and in-kind benefits  obtained by the taxpayer:    First, the tax shall not apply to the representation  allowance or entertainment allowance unless it exceeds 2,500  pounds annually, provided that the allowance doesn't exceed the  original salary, recompense, or wages and that no exemptions  established in accordance with special laws are violated.    Second, the tax shall not apply to sums collected by workers  as production incentives, provided that the incentives are  within the limits of 100 percent the original salary,  recompense, or wages and that they don't exceed 3,000 pounds  annually.    [Third], in applying the provisions of this law the  following  shall be considered production incentives:    A. Sums paid by the government, local government units,  public authorities, and public sector companies and units as  production incentives in accordance with the laws and  regulations governing such incentives.    B. Sums paid by private sector establishments governed by  the  provisions of this law to increase production or to enhance  their service level, provided that they are paid in accordance  with regulations issued on a decree by the minister of finance,  after consultation with the minister of manpower.    Fourth, the tax shall not apply to cash or in-kind housing  allowance obtained by foreign experts who are taxable in  accordance with the rate established in article 90 of this law  and by Egyptians who work in land reclamation and development  projects and in mining projects and who are subject to the  aforementioned tax rate.    Fifth, sums collected by representatives of the regional  offices of foreign companies and establishments in Egypt shall  not be taxable, except for the equivalent of their activity in  Egypt.    In all cases, the total sum of the hazardous work,  representation, and entertainment allowances and production  incentives exempted from the tax in accordance with the  aforementioned paragraphs of this article may not exceed 4,000  pounds annually.    Article 52. The tax shall apply to sums paid to foreign  experts, regardless of the agency or authority employing them to  perform services under its control, provided that they are not  employed for more than 183 consecutive or interspersed days  annually. The tax shall apply to these sums without any  deduction for living or family burdens.    The tax shall also apply to sums that taxable workers of the  state's administrative apparatus units, local government, public  authorities, public sector units, public business sector, and  workers treated in accordance with special cadres collect on top  of their salaries from any ministry, public authority,  administrative agency, local government, public sector, and  business sector unit that is not their original employer. These  sums shall be taxable without any reduction for living or family  burdens.    In all cases, the tax shall be withheld and then remitted to  the tax commission concerned within the first 15 days of each  month in accordance with the conditions and procedures  determined by the executive regulations.  <H5>  Tax Exemption </H5>   [Mustafa] What are the tax exemptions and do they include  social security and life insurance subscriptions?    ['Abd-al-Baqi] Tax exemptions are determined by the law and  they are explicitly stated in the following articles:    Article 54. The following shall be exempted from the tax:    A. Social security subscriptions and savings installments  deducted in accordance with the social security laws, in  accordance with alternative systems, or in accordance with  government pension and savings laws.    B. Workers' subscriptions to private insurance funds  established in accordance with the provisions of law No. 54 of  1975.    C. Life and health insurance installments paid by the  taxpayer for himself and for his wife and underage children.    For cases B and C, it is conditional that the total deducted  by the taxpayer may not exceed 15 percent of the net income or  1,000 pounds, whichever is the lesser of the two. The same  installments and subscriptions may not be deducted from other  revenues listed in article 5 of this law.    D. Lifelong incomes paid by insurance companies for  insurance  policies of a duration of no less than 10 years.    Article 55. Ten percent of the total taxable income, plus a  sum of 2,000 pounds, shall be deducted for income-earning  expense, after subtracting the subscriptions and sums listed in  paragraphs A, B, and C of article 54 of this law and before  subtracting the deduction established for family burdens in  accordance with article 88 of this law.    Article 56. Free or reduced-rate travel permits and tickets  and free furniture transportation coupons granted by the Public  Railroads Authority to their workers and their families for  purposes not connected with the service shall be exempted from  the tax.    Free or reduced-rate tickets which Egyptian or foreign land  transportation companies, airlines, or maritime companies  operating in Egypt grant to their workers and their families  shall also be exempted.    The above is in addition to the exemption established for  family burdens by articles 88 and 89 of this law.  <H5>  Requirements for Statement Submission </H5>   [Mustafa] What are the tax rates? Are wage earners required  to submit the annual unified tax statement? What about appeal  and contestation procedures?    ['Abd-al-Baqi] Regarding salaries and similar revenues  listed  in section three of this book, the tax rate applying to them  will be 20 percent for sums up to 50,000 pounds and 32 percent  for sums in excess of 50,000 pounds.    Article 62 of this law states the following: "A taxpayer  shall be exempted from submitting the statement stipulated in  article 91 of this law for his income from wages and similar  revenues listed in this section. The taxpayer shall also be  exempted from listing the aforementioned income in the statement  he submits in accordance with article 91 of this law for other  sources of income."    Article 65 of this law states that "within one month as of  the date of receiving the taxable income, the taxpayer may  object to the tax assessment by applying to the party that  deducted the tax.    "This party shall be required to send this application,  coupled with its response, to the tax commission concerned  within 30 days as of the date on which the application is  submitted.    "The commission shall examine the application. If it  determines that the objections expressed by the taxpayer are  serious in nature, it shall notify the aforementioned party to  amend the tax assessment. If not persuaded that the objections  are sound in nature, the commission shall refer the application  to the appeals committee in accordance with the provisions of  article 157 of this law and shall notify the plaintiff concerned  by registered letter within 30 days as of the date of referral."</p>

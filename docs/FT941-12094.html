			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Glimmer of hope over Richmond Oil relisting Richmond Oil &amp; Gas, the natural resources company which has lost or sold virtually all of its original assets over the past two years, yesterday offered shareholders a glimmer of hope by suggesting that its shares might resume trading in the next few weeks. Long-suffering investors, who have watched the share price fall from a peak of 173p to September's suspension price of 4 1/2 p, were told at the annual meeting that Richmond was in negotiations which could lead to a relisting. Richmond is understood to be in talks with its joint venture partner, Northstar Energy, a Panamanian company owned by Annum International, a Luxembourg vehicle for Lithuanian and US interests. Northstar last year bought 85 per cent of Richmond's interest in a Russian joint venture to enhance production in a Siberian oil field. It is understood that this interest, along with some other properties, may be sold back to Richmond in return for shares. Northstar is also understood to be seeking board representation. Richmond has just four directors, three of whom are non-executive, following the resignations last month of its chairman and managing director. Discussions with Northstar are expected to be concluded within the next six weeks. Richmond also unveiled a sharp jump in interim losses from Pounds 386,000 to Pounds 963,000 for the six months to September 30. Turnover fell from Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 34,000. The company also stated that it had agreed a revised price for the sale of its coalbed methane properties, which have been the subject of protracted disputes. Richmond had received Dollars 4.5m (Pounds 3m), instead of Dollars 6.2m, in return for enhanced repurchase options. There is the possibility of up to a further Dollars 1.1m, depending on the resolution of the disputes. The directors stated in the 1993 results, published last month, that the company's commercial future depended on receiving a minimum consideration of Dollars 5.5m.</p>

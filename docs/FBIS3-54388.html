[passage omitted]    Political and media circles in Algeria are asking on the eve  of the national conference about the "new successor" of 'Ali  Kafi, chairman of the Higher State Council [HCE], whose term  terminates on 31 January.    Abdelaziz Bouteflika (foreign minister in the days of the  late President Houari Boumedienne and member of the FLN Central  Committee) is still the name mentioned in official state circles  in Algeria, especially after his meeting with the military  establishment and his "temporary" nomination to lead the  transitional phase.    A reliable source has told AL-HAYAH that the military  establishment has accepted the conditions set by Bouteflika.  They are:    1. To appoint him by the military establishment as  president, and that his appointment should not be based on a  proposal from the national conference scheduled to be held  tomorrow.    2. To grant him all the powers granted to the president of  the republic in accordance with the present Constitution. He  does not accept the formula for collective power sharing  represented in the five-member Higher State Council or the one  proposed in the "document on the dialogue terms," which  stipulated the existence of one or two vice presidents.    3. To work in accordance with the present Constitution,  which should not be amended. And the "document on dialogue  terms" should not be adopted as a new constitution.    4. To grant him full powers to appoint or dismiss the prime  minister.    5. Not to impose on him the formula proposed in the  "document on dialogue terms" with regard to the transitional  national assembly appointed by the parties, organizations, and  associations participating in the national conference.

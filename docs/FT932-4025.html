			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: DTI merger plan for research labs A NEW National Centre for Environmental Technology is to be formed following a controversial merger announced by the government yesterday between AEA Technology and the Warren Spring Labor-atory. The announcement by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, means that Warren Spring - the country's leading applied environmental research laboratory, based near Stevenage, Herts - will close. As many as possible of the 200 scientists will be transferred to AEA Technology's laboratories at Harwell and Culham in Oxfordshire. Mr Heseltine said in a Commons written answer that uniting Britain's two main bases of environmental research would create a single centre of excellence, but there was strong criticism of the proposal from the Warren Spring workforce and from the Opposition. Mr Chris Smith, shadow environment spokesman, said the closure was a disaster for the environment. 'The decision will destroy Warren Spring's independent identity and remove at a stroke a substantial part of its expertise . . it is clear the exercise is being undertaken purely as a fattening up preparation for privatisation,' he said. Mr Joe Magee of the Institution of Professional Managers and Specialists said the announcement betrayed the government's obligations to the environment and industry, and broke a pledge to await the outcome of the review of all five DTI research laboratories. But Mr Heseltine said the merger would provide a more comprehensive service and give better value for money.</p>

			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / US Money and Credit: Investors wait for the dust to settle YESTERDAY'S grudging French vote in favour of the Maastricht treaty should allow US credit markets to focus more fully on America's domestic economic difficulties and the chances of a further interest rate cut. The US bond market, along with the rest of the western financial world, spent the weekend focused on the outcome of the French vote. A French No would probably have reinforced last week's strengthening of both the dollar and short-dated US Treasury issues as investors moved into these traditional safe havens. Trading was subdued on Thursday and Friday, ahead of the vote and following the extraordinary gyrations in European currency markets on Wednesday. Many investors want to sit on the sidelines until the European dust settles. Throughout last week's European crisis, US credit markets remained a haven of relative tranquillity. On Wednesday, when the crisis broke, the long end of the US Treasury market was knocked lower, while the short end, including three-year notes, moved higher, in a normal response to market uncertainty. In both cases the movements were modest, but the result was to further widen the huge yield gap between the short and long ends. By Friday night the yield on the benchmark 30-year issue was 7.32 per cent, up 0.03 per cent on a week ago, while three-month treasury bills stood at 2.93 per cent, down 0.05 per cent. Even with yesterday's Yes vote, many analysts believe that continued uncertainty over the future of the ERM is essentially bullish for the US fixed income market. The dollar has been rallying amid expectations that Germany interest rates are headed lower, which will narrow the huge yield differential between the two markets. This is turn, goes the Wall Street consensus, will give Mr Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, further scope to cut US interest rates. The Fed last eased on September 4, when it knocked 25 basis points off the Fed Funds rate. Some believe it would have liked to move more aggressively, but was deterred by fear of weakening the dollar. Certainly, there are still precious few signs of robust US economic growth, though last week's batch of bad news had little effect on the market amid the European excitements. Retail sales fell 0.5 per cent in August, much more than expected, although the impact of this was blunted by an upward revision in the July figures, to a 1 per cent increase. Poor consumer confidence means a continued reluctance to buy durable goods. Industrial production also dipped in August, with capacity utilisation down to 78.5 per cent, compared with 79 per cent the month before. All this is creating widespread expectations of a further easing move by the Fed, with analysts circling the date of October 2 as the likeliest time for action. This is when employment data for September will be released. The Fed's last two rate cuts occured on days when the government reported particularly dire employment statistics. An easing would immediately benefit the short end of the market, but the long end faces residual concerns about inflation which may intensify in the final weeks of the presidential election campaign if Mr Bill Clinton, the Democratic nominee, sustains his lead in the opinion polls. Strongly Republican Wall Street tends to see the Democrats as the party of inflation. What is unclear is the extent to which the US capital markets have already factored in the possibility of a Clinton presidency and its implications. A view seems to be growing that whoever is the next president, the US economy will remain so sluggish, and the budget deficit so restrictive, that inflation will remain subdued for a long time yet.</p>

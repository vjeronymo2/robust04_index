			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Russian Elections: Zhirinovsky does a star turn - Liberal-Democratic leader is at no loss for words Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who has talked of invading neighbouring Turkey and of conducting summary executions to end crime, was yesterday putting himself across as a man of the world. Accompanied by his elegant wife to a Moscow polling-station, he did a star turn in four languages - English, German, French and Turkish - for reporters, focusing on the need to fight 'la misere' as he put it. But his main credo - repeated time and again during his campaign - is to look after Russians, in Russia and in the former Soviet republics. As part of that package, he has constantly stressed his Russianness and attacked all manner of foreigners, despite the fact that he himself was born in the republic of Kazakhstan, and has a foreign-sounding patronymic, Wolfovich. Skirting around the possible embarrassment that this might cause him with his patriotic anti-foreign constituency, he once said, when asked for his nationality, that his mother was Russian and his father was a lawyer. He has successfully exploited the role of underdog. His autobiography reads like a Russian version of Hitler's 'Mein Kampf' in terms of its self-pitying portrayal of a lad making his own way in the world despite all obstacles. Although some voters yesterday described him variously as 'the incarnation of evil' and 'deranged' - all recognise he is extremely articulate. His campaign appearances have been clear, humorous, and extremely easy to understand. He can also point to being the only party leader in this election who has never been a member of the Communist party. After graduating from the Oriental Studies and Law faculties of Moscow University, he worked as a lawyer, most recently as head of the legal service of Mir publishing-house until 1990. In that year he founded his Liberal-Democratic party, at a time when other fledgling parties began to challenge the monopoly of the Communist party. He first rose to prominence in Russia's first presidential election in June the following year when he captured 6m votes and came third among five candidates. While Russia's Choice on Friday confessed that it had been a mistake not to take Mr Zhirinovsky seriously, some of his opponents in this election continue to suspect him of being a puppet manipulated by other forces. Mr Yuri Boldyrev, a leader of the Yabloko group, said for instance that having been restored to the political limelight by the Kremlin when he was invited to help draft the new constitution, Mr Zhirinovsky would prove a 'useful enemy' for Mr Yeltsin in the new parliament.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, May 2 (AFP) -- Three shells exploded here  Sunday in apparent violation of a ceasefire and a heavy weapons  ban, the United Nations said. Two shells fell about 300 metres  (yards) east of the Grbavica bridge, which links the downtown  Serb-held district with the rest of the city that is controlled  by the Moslem-dominated government army, according to Guy Vinet,  a UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) officer. A third shell was  later reported falling on the outskirts of the city. There were  no immediate reports of injuries and Eric Chaperon, UNPROFOR  spokesman, described the shelling as part of the usual  cease-fire violations. Government and Serb forces, faced with a  threat of NATO airstrikes, were ordered in February to place all  heavy weapons under UN control or move them outside a  20-kilometre (12-mile) exclusion zone.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer] There is no conflict at all among the  Government of the Republic of Kosova, the Kosova Democratic  Alliance [LDK], and the president of the republic, President of  the Republic of Kosova Dr. Ibrahim Rugova said to reporters in  Prishtina today. A report by our reporter Sherif Konjufca:    [Konjufca] Kosova, an independent and neutral state,  simultaneously open to Albania and Serbia, is the most lucky  solution for both Albanians and Serbs. However, to avoid armed  conflicts in this area, the president of the Republic of Kosova  said at a meeting with reporters, we once again reiterate our  demands that Kosova be placed under international protection.    Asked whether there exists a conflict between the prime  minister, the LDK, and the president, Mr. Rugova answered that  such a conflict does not exist. The government has worked in  very difficult conditions, partly abroad and partly in the  country, but it has acted in cooperation with us. Under the  present situation, it is very normal and reasonable to complete  the government with the most creative people. For this, there  exists a disposition by the majority of the Albanian political  parties in Kosova, whose willpower will be outlined in their  coordinating council, but cannot assume the government  prerogatives.    Mr. Rugova said that as chairman of the republic, I have  prerogatives as well as an obligation to think about the  completion of the government and other bodies that will assist  it. The best work in this situation is that regarding national  political capital questions, we have reached a consensus with  all political parties, and this makes us stronger.    Asked about the importance of the international conference  on  the Balkans, which is being held in Istanbul, President Rugova  said that this is the first time such a meeting is being held,  in which the Balkan problems are being examined in a complex way  and in a historic, actual, and future aspect.    The delegation of Kosova led by Mr. Bukoshi is attending  this  conference, among experts from 26 countries. Meanwhile, we are  expecting much from the conference's final statement.    Talking about the forms of the Serb violence against  Albanians, Mr. Rugova particularly pointed out the eviction of  Albanians from their homes and other forms of the colonization  of Kosova with Serbs and Montenegrins. He mentioned cases of  the division of 150 hectares of social land in Kline for Serbian  refugees from Slovenia, Croatia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina and the  decision to erect 220 houses for them in the Istog commune. For  the Serb refugees from Albania, whom the Serbian installed power  is placing in Junik village and in several Gjakove villages,  President Rugova said that we will ask the UN High Commission  for Refugees to treat them only as temporary refugees, and not  as elements for the colonization of Kosova. Otherwise, Mr.  Rugova said, we will consider the Commission to be responsible  for violently changing the ethnic structure of Kosova.</p>

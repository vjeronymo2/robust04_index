Recently, he was chosen the "best  trumpet player in the world" in a Down Beat readers' poll.  </P> <P> Hubbard will be joined Friday by local pianist Theo Saunders and members of  Hubbard's quintet, including accompanying trumpeter Bob Shephard and drummer  Ralph Penland. Concert-goers will hear an encyclopedia of musical ideas on the  trumpet, as well as Hubbard's fuller-sounding fluegelhorn performance.  </P> <P> Seating for the two-hour concert is $25. A dinner show package is $50. Wheeler  Hot Springs is at 16825 Maricopa Highway, Ojai. For more information and  reservations, call 646-8131.  </P></p>

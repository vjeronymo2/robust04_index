			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Bowater Yesterday's US acquisition by Bowater was enough to maintain its forward momentum. The 2 per cent rise in the shares against a falling market is another footnote in a four-year record of outperformance. But Bowater's balance sheet is showing the strain. Yesterday's deal adds 6 percentage points to gearing, due in part to the write-off of Dollars 78m goodwill. Interest cover is strong, but Bowater's self-imposed gearing limit of 75 per cent leaves it room for perhaps one more big deal before shareholders are again asked to chip in. If earnings per share growth can be maintained, another rights issue next year might not interrupt the upward march of the shares. But the new UK accounting regime will not help the earnings record. If the Accounting Standards Board gets its way, the cost of rationalising acquired companies will be charged against profits rather than buried in the balance sheet. Bowater has not been aggressive in this respect, but rationalisation provisions for last year's Pounds 450m purchase of DRG and Cope Allman still amounted to Pounds 42m. Tougher conditions in US healthcare may also be a worry. If buyers are serious about cost containment, hospital suppliers of the kind acquired will suffer. Bowater's pharmaceutical packaging plant in Puerto Rico might also face disruption if President Clinton revokes tax breaks for drugs companies manufacturing there. With the business growing strongly, such pressures would not send Bowater into reverse. But a price/earnings multiple well above the market average leaves it exposed to any mishaps.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Danish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Iver Hoj: "Serbs Will Decide If We Are at War"] </F>   [Text] Military theorists agree that NATO's first act of  war in 45 years intensifies the conflict in Bosnia. But there is  profound disagreement on whether the attack was necessary.    After U.S. NATO planes shot down four Bosnian Serb planes,  it  is the Serbs who will decide if Denmark becomes a belligerent  power for the first time since 1864.    That is the view of retired Lieutenant Colonel Regner R.  Moller, a jurist who was administrative chief of the Defense  Research Service and a member of the Defense Research and  Analysis Group until October 1993, following the first NATO  attack in the alliance's 45-year history. "Denmark, as a NATO  country, is not automatically at war with the Bosnian Serbs. But  this was not a defense against an attacking  adversary. This was an air attack -- whether or not there are UN  resolutions. If the Serbs regard this as an act of aggression on  the part of NATO or the United Nations and think they are at war  with the aggressors, then Denmark will also be at war," he said.    Unlike another military theorist, Lieutenant Colonel Michael  Clemmesen of the Defense Academy, who considers the action  logical and justified, Moller is worried that Denmark might be  heading into a war because -- in his opinion -- U.S. F-16 planes  overreacted in the air space over Bosnia. He sees many  unclarified political pitfalls in the development. Among other  things, the question of who gave the order to shoot the planes  down is decisive:    "Was it a NATO general or the UN system? If it was the  United  Nations, the world stands together. If it was NATO -- and the  Serbs can seek support from Russia -- Denmark and NATO could be  on their way into a conflict that could have incalculable  political consequences."    Moller -- who is a member of the Farum municipal council for  the Liberal Party -- belongs to the wing of military theorists  who want a low NATO profile in Bosnia-Herzegovina. And he is  very concerned that the clearly superior F-16 planes shot down  four outdated Serb planes.    "That should not be necessary. It is the NATO hawks who have  the upper hand. I fear this could Vietnamize the conflict in the  Balkans," he said.  <H5>  Important Hours </H5>   Lt. Col. Clemmesen has a firm and entirely different  assessment of the events:    "The Serbs must have perceived that the recent signals from  Russia meant they could do anything -- as long as they did not  touch Sarajevo. It looks like a quite deliberate move on the  part of the Serbs.    ``When six planes take off simultaneously and fly in  formation, it is a crystal-clear violation of the flight ban.  NATO regarded the action as a gross violation of the UN  resolution. Quite rightly.''  <H5>  Serb Provocation </H5>   Clemmesen refused to call the shooting down of the planes a  move on NATO's part.    "It was a programmed action, entirely prepared for. The  possibility that they would react if this kind of thing happened  has been in the air. We are sending a signal to the Serbs that  we will ensure that the UN role is fulfilled. But this is a  striking change in the normal picture in Bosnia. It is a  deliberate Serb provocation and the next 24 to 48 hours will be  very important. If the Serbs -- as seems likely -- choose to  deny that the planes were shot down, it will be a good thing. If  so, they apparently accept the fact that they must try to avoid  losing face to an even greater extent."</p>

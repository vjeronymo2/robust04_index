			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section I&hyph;A&hyph;1. Any recombinant DNA experiment, which according to the NIH  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Guidelines requires approval by the NIH, must be submitted to the NIH or to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> another Federal agency that has jurisdiction for review and approval. Once  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approval, or other applicable clearances, has been obtained from a Federal agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other than the NIH (whether the experiment is referred to that agency by the NIH  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or sent directly there by the submitter), the experiment may proceed without the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessity for NIH review or approval (see exceptions in Sections I&hyph;A&hyph;2 and I&hyph;A&hyph;3).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section I&hyph;A&hyph;2. Certain experiments that involve the deliberate transfer of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recombinant DNA or DNA or RNA derived from recombinant DNA into one or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more human subjects (see Section V&hyph;U) shall be considered Major Actions (see  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section IV&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;b&hyph;(1)), and shall require RAC review and NIH Director approval, if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined by NIH/ORDA in consultation with the RAC Chair and/or one or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more RAC members, as necessary, to: (i) Represent novel characteristics (e.g.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> target disease or vector), (ii) represent an uncertain degree of risk to human health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or the environment, or (iii) contain information determined to require further public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review (see Section III&hyph;A&hyph;2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section I&hyph;A&hyph;3. Experiments involving the transfer of recombinant DNA to one or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more human subjects that are not considered under Section III&hyph;A&hyph;2 may qualify for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accelerated Review (see Section III&hyph;B&hyph;2 and Appendix M&hyph;V) and will be considered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as Minor Actions (see Section IV&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;b&hyph;(2)&hyph;(a)). Actions that qualify for Accelerated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Review will be reviewed and approved by NIH/ORDA in consultation with the RAC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chair and/or one or more RAC members, as necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Certain experiments involving the transfer of recombinant DNA or DNA or RNA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> derived from recombinant DNA into one or more human subjects (see Section V&hyph;U)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may be considered exempt from RAC and/or NIH/ORDA review and/or NIH  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Director approval and only require registration with NIH/ORDA (see Section III&hyph;C&hyph;7).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section I&hyph;B. Definition of Recombinant DNA Molecules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the context of the NIH Guidelines, recombinant DNA molecules are defined as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> either: (i) Molecules that are constructed outside living cells by joining natural or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> synthetic DNA segments to DNA molecules that can replicate in a living cell, or (ii)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> molecules that result from the replication of those described in (i) above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Synthetic DNA segments which are likely to yield a potentially harmful  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> polynucleotide or polypeptide (e.g., a toxin or a pharmacologically active agent) are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered as equivalent to their natural DNA counterpart. If the synthetic DNA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> segment is not expressed  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in vivo <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  as a biologically active polynucleotide or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> polypeptide product, it is exempt from the NIH Guidelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Genomic DNA of plants and bacteria that have acquired a transposable element,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> even if the latter was donated from a recombinant vector no longer present, are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to the NIH Guidelines unless the transposon itself contains recombinant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DNA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section I&hyph;C. General Applicability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section I&hyph;C&hyph;1. The NIH Guidelines are applicable to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section I&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;a. All recombinant DNA research within the United States (U.S.) or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its territories that is conducted at or sponsored by an institution that receives any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> support for recombinant DNA research from the NIH, including research performed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directly by the NIH. An individual who receives support for research involving  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recombinant DNA must be associated with or sponsored by an institution that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assumes the responsibilities assigned in the NIH Guidelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section I&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;b. All recombinant DNA research performed abroad: Specifically:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section I&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;b&hyph;(1). Research supported by NIH funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section I&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;b&hyph;(2). If they involve testing in humans of materials containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recombinant DNA developed with NIH funds and if the institution that developed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those materials sponsors or participates in those projects. Participation includes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> research collaboration or contractual agreements, not mere provision of research  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> materials.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section I&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;b&hyph;(3). If the host country has established rules for the conduct of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recombinant DNA research, then the research must be in compliance with those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rules. If the host country does not have such rules, the proposed research must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reviewed and approved by an NIH-approved Institutional Biosafety Committee or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equivalent review body and accepted in writing by an appropriate national  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> governmental authority of the host country. The safety practices that are employed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> abroad must be reasonably consistent with the NIH Guidelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section I&hyph;D.

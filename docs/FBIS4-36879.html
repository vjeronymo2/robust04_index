			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] AL-MAJD has learned that President Saddam Husayn  has made major changes in the Iraqi security agencies. Major  General Sabir al-Duri, director of the General Intelligence, was  transferred to the post of an adviser at the Presidency and  replaced as director of General Intelligence by al-Anbar  Governor Mani' 'Abd-al-Rashid.    A reliable source arriving from Iraq said three more  officials from the al-Duri tribe, which is known for its close  links to the regime, were dismissed from their posts. These are  Khadr al-Duri, member of the Regional Command of the ruling  Ba'th Party; 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Duri; and 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Duri,  who is said to have fled to Syria.    The Iraqi source said Maj. Gen. al-Duri was dismissed from  his post as intelligence chief probably after it was discovered  that the Iraqi intelligence service was involved in the  assassination of the Iraqi opposition figure Shaykh Talib Suhayl  in Beirut and the assassination of a German journalist named  Lisi Schmidt [name as published]. An officer named Safi  al-Tikriti was in charge of the two operations. [passage  omitted]</p>

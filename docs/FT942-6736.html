			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / UK Company News: London City bids for Towles Towles, the lossmaking clothing manufacturer, was the subject of a Pounds 4.22m cash bid yesterday from London City, an Australian investment group, which has 51 per cent of the shares but only 14 per cent of the votes. London City, which has been a shareholder since 1987, said it was 'outraged' at Towles' continuing losses. Mr Peter Murray, chairman of London City, said: 'We fear for the value of our own investment and have no alternative but to make an offer.' The offers, which were announced after the market closed, are 265p cash for each ordinary share, 115p cash for each A ordinary share, 52p for each A preference share and 78p for each B preference share. These represent a premium over the last recorded market prices. This week Towles reported losses up from Pounds 146,000 to Pounds 236,000 for the year to February 28 on turnover of Pounds 15.7m (Pounds 16.2m). London City said it planned to introduce 'new and experienced senior textile management' if the offers are successful. There was no response from Towles which was closed for its spring holiday.</p>

			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / The Pineau-Valencienne Affair: Journey to prison - the businessman's nightmare Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne is living a businessman's nightmare. Since he travelled, voluntarily, to Brussels on May 26 to make a statement concerning an investigation into two Belgian subsidiaries of his electrical engineering group, the Schneider chairman has been locked up in the city's ageing Forest prison, under investigation for alleged fraud and embezzlement. 'It is a cautionary tale of the risks for managers of multinational groups,' says a French industrialist. 'Many businessmen are wondering to what extent they are responsible for every part of their company's operations. Many are watching this case very carefully.' The nature of the problems encountered by Schneider in Belgium extends well beyond the question of senior management's liability for operations in different countries. A long and contorted affair links Schneider's headquarters in the smart 16th arrondissement of Paris and a prison known locally as the 'black hole of Brussels.' A landmark came in November 1992 when Schneider launched an offer to buy out minority shareholders in Cofibel and Cofimines, two Belgian financial subsidiaries. Minority shareholders protested against the terms of the offer, which was launched at BFr2,525 per share for Cofibel and BFr1,265 for Cofimines. They claimed that the bid undervalued their investments and that Schneider manipulated sales of shares to benefit its own balance sheet. Mr Andre de Barsy, one of the rebel investors, said last week he had collected files of information incriminating Schneider's management in the conduct of the offer. In support of their claim, the disgruntled minority shareholders filed a suit in Brussels to secure a higher bid price. After protracted and bitter negotiations, Schneider raised its offer to BFr3,400 per share for Cofibel and BFr1,475 per share for Cofimines. The improved terms cleared the way for an accord with minority shareholders at the beginning of this year. The original complaint, however, had set Belgium's legal wheels into motion. Mr Jean-Claude Van Espen, a well known prosecuting magistrate, with a history of handling financial fraud cases, had launched an investigation in October 1993. The probe continued after the resolution of the dispute with minority shareholders and is the reason why Mr Pineau-Valencienne stayed behind bars at the weekend. Following the agreement with minority shareholders, Mr Pineau-Valencienne was confident the case could be brought quickly to a close. 'He had appointments in his diary for Friday,' said one colleague, referring to the day after the Schneider chairman's visit to Brussels last month. Instead, he was held without charge, under investigation for fraud, benefiting from fraud, embezzlement and falsification of accounts. He was detained for the five days of preventive detention allowed under Belgian law. Last Wednesday, a Brussels' court confirmed the nature of the investigation and ordered the Schneider chairman to remain in prison for a period of up to one month. Since Wednesday's hearing, the thrust of the inquiry into Schneider and Mr Pineau-Valencienne has become clearer. After the ruling to extend the Schneider chairman's detention, the prosecution issued a statement alleging 'illicit manoeuvres' through which the company received more than BFr3bn at the expense of its Belgian subsidiaries between 1988 and 1992. According to the prosecutors, Schneider had concealed offshore companies and assets worth about BFr4.8bn from regulators and shareholders in Cofimines and Cofibel. Dividends totalling BFr1.8bn from the offshore companies registered in Panama and Bermuda were not distributed to all shareholders in the subsidiaries, the prosecutors believe. The investigation is also focusing on the dealings of PB Finance, a Belgian shell company in which Cofibel held a minority stake of 25 per cent before selling out earlier this year. The company was controlled by Mr Valentino Foti, an Italian businessmen, who represented Fimo, a Swiss Italian company. Mr Foti, arrested as part of the same investigation, served as a director on the board of Schneider's Belgian subsidiaries during the period before the offer to minority shareholders. Schneider denies the accusations of the Belgian prosecutors and says it 'deplores' the actions taken against its chairman. It claims it never harmed interests of minority shareholders and that Mr Pineau-Valencienne, although nominally chairman of Cofibel and Cofimines, was not actively involved in their management. This task fell instead to Mr Jean Verdoot, who was managing director of the subsidiaries until his death last year. Schneider says its ties to the group of offshore companies at the centre of the investigation are an historical accident, dating back to the group's origins in the business empire of the Belgian Empain family. Schneider claims the offshore companies, as with many Belgian groups, were established in the 1960s to protect mining interests in the Belgian Congo (now Zaire) from nationalisation after independence. Schneider denies benefiting from funds generated by the offshore companies, except in the form of dividends to Cofibel and Cofimines. The company has also firmly denied allegations in the Belgian press that PB Finance was involved in money-laundering activities. 'There is nothing in the structure of PB Finance which would allow any laundering of any kind,' said Mr Pineau-Valencienne in an interview with Les Echos, the French business daily, last October. 'I would add that money has rather been burned than laundered because the company has lost a lot of money,' he said. Cofibel sold its shares in PB Finance earlier this year and the company is currently being managed by court-appointed lawyers. Despite denials by Schneider of any irregularities, the events to date leave several questions unanswered. Why did Mr Pineau-Valencienne travel to Brussels apparently unaware of the legal risks involved? Were decisions taken which, as the prosecutors allege, acted against the interests of Belgian minority shareholders? If this was the case, to what extent could Mr Pineau-Valencienne have been involved? On the first count, Schneider says its chairman was taken by surprise and fell victim to an over-zealous Belgian legal system. 'We have encountered a very particular judge,' said a company official after the chairman's arrest. 'Mr Pineau-Valencienne went to Brussels to make a statement which he believed would resolve the whole affair.' The answer to the second and third points is more complex, and will partly depend on a study of documents and correspondence taken by prosecutors after a search of Schneider's Paris headquarters by French and Belgian police last week. The documents have been studied over the weekend and will be used to decide whether Mr Pineau-Valencienne's appeal to be released will be upheld. An appeal is due to be heard early this week, and a decision should be made within 11 days. Ironically, it was Mr Pineau-Valencienne's attempt to bring more coherence into the disparate group of companies he inherited in 1981 that lies behind his current plight. His decision to buy out the minority investors, he says, was an attempt to rationalise the 'unimaginable imbroglio' of Schneider's Belgian operations. As he sits in his cell in Forest prison, he is confronted by an imbroglio which appears denser still.</p>

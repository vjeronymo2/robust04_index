			<p><P> April 3, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> LOPEZ DUMP EMISSIONS PLAN CALLED INADEQUATE;  </P> <P> LANDFILL: A TOUR OF LOPEZ CANYON REVEALED CONCENTRATED POCKETS OF METHANE GAS.  THE CITY IS ASKING THAT LIMITS ON EMISSIONS BE RELAXED.  </P> <P> City of Los Angeles and local air pollution officials have quietly agreed that  a plan approved in 1988 to limit methane gas emissions from the Lopez Canyon  dump in Lake View Terrace is inadequate, and more costly steps need to be  taken, records showed Monday.  </P> <P> The city, meanwhile, is asking that limits on methane emissions be relaxed  until it is capable of meeting the standards.  </P> <P> The need to revise the gas control plan was revealed in documents the city  filed March 21 asking the South Coast Air Quality Management District to  suspend enforcement of its rules regulating methane emissions at the city-owned  Lopez Canyon landfill, where 4,000 tons of garbage are dumped daily.  </P> <P> Attached to the exemption application was a warning issued to the city March 1  by an air district inspector. The inspector said that a three-hour tour of  Lopez Canyon revealed concentrated pockets of methane -- the flammable,  explosive and often smelly gas produced by rotting garbage and other biological  processes.  </P> <P> The inspector said he found "many" areas where methane readings exceeded 10,000  parts per million, 20 times the air district's limit of 500. City equipment for  measuring the gas also was found to be faulty, registering emissions  "significantly" below the real amounts, the inspector's report related.  </P> <P> In light of such continuing problems, the city soon will seek the air  district's permission to drill up to 200 more gas collection wells at the  landfill, according to the documents filed with the air district.  </P> <P> Mal Toy, a top official with the city's Bureau of Sanitation, said recently the  city will install as many wells as it takes to control the problem. The wells  pipe the gas from underground, where it forms, to the surface, where it can be  burned.  </P> <P> The city's current plan for limiting methane gas problems at the dump --  approved by the air district in February, 1988 -- calls for only 43 wells.  Thirty of the 43 wells have been installed, using six miles of pipe.  </P> <P> "We've informed the city that more wells need to be installed in the canyon,"  said Moshen Nazemi, an air district supervising engineer who deals with  landfill-related air pollution problems. "Nobody knows exactly how many more  are needed. It's not a simple plug-in-the-numbers type of thing."  </P> <P> Also, the air district believes the city must dig gas collection wells deeper  into the canyon's 1,700-foot deep mound of garbage, Nazemi said. This might  require the city to hire private contractors because city crews are not  equipped to dig deep wells, Nazemi said.  </P> <P> Installing the additional wells could cost from $200,000 to $1 million, the  city documents estimate.  </P> <P> In the meantime, the city Bureau of Sanitation is also asking the air district  to stop enforcing its 500 p.p.m. rule at the landfill, saying that it is unable  to comply. The air district will consider the city's application April 17, said  Dave Rutherford, a spokesman for the agency.  </P> <P> The city is seeking to increase the garbage it dumps at its 392-acre Lopez  Canyon landfill from 400 to 650 truckloads per day.  </P> <P> Kagel Canyon and Lake View Terrace resident groups, backed by Councilman Ernani  Bernardi, the area's representative, are fighting the expansion project.  </P></p>

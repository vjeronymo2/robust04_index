			<p><P> January 2, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A LOOK AT WHAT'S IN STORE FOR BUSINESS AND WORKERS;  </P> <P> IT WON'T BE DULL, THAT'S FOR SURE. THE NEW YEAR WILL SEE DRAMATIC CHANGES FOR  U.S. INDUSTRY AND THE AMERICAN WORKER. BUSINESS WRITERS AT THE TIMES POLLED  EXPERTS ON WHAT IS LIKELY TO HAPPEN IN 1989. HERE IS THEIR REPORT.;  </P> <P> ADVERTISING  </P> <P> In the advertising industry, 1989 may best be described as the year of the  poacher. Because most executives are expecting billings growth of only 6% to  7%, there are increasing suspicions that the only sure-fire way to grow larger  in 1989 will be to steal the business from someone else.  </P> <P> Already, a slew of agencies are chasing after all or parts of the $200- million  Burger King business that is now up for grabs. And in mid-December,  Admarketing, a Los Angeles ad agency, dumped the $15-million HomeClub ad  business in order to take away the more lucrative, $25-million Home Depot  advertising account from a competitor.  </P> <P> Also, as advertising giants like Kraft, Pillsbury and RJR Nabisco continue to  mix it up in the buyout arena, a number of client conflicts could arise,  forcing some ad agencies to make tough decisions on which clients to keep --  and how to keep all clients happy.  </P> <P> Generally, advertising executives expect that their clients will continue to  spend more money on various forms of sales promotion and direct marketing --  and less in more conventional forms of advertising such as network television  and radio.

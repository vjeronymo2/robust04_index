			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "What's the News" rubric: </F> "Russian Population Down by One Million"]    [Text] The Russian president's Commission on the Affairs  of Women, Family, and Demography has held a meeting. Commission  Chairman Yekaterina Lyakhova delivered a report "On the Status  of Families in the Russian Federation."    The report noted, in particular, that as of 1 January 1994  Russia had a population of 148.4 million people, that is, the  Russian population has declined by nearly 1 million from 1992.  Mortality has exceeded birth rate.    The author attributed this to the worsening of Russian  families' social situation. For instance, the new system of  child benefits introduced in January 1994 does not ensure even a  level of benefits comparable with that of January 1991.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Xia Haitao, Song Bingheng, Liu Shun] </F>   [Text] Cairo, April 19 (XINHUA) -- There is an analogy  between Egyptian and Chinese economic reforms and the two can  make use of each other's experience, President Husni Mubarak  told Chinese journalists prior to his visit to China.    In an interview Monday [18 April], Mubarak said that as a  developing country that adopted centralized economic planning,  Egypt has borne a lot of burdens as a result of several armed  conflicts in the Middle East. It has met with difficulties in  creating the infrastructure necessary for economic development,  and has suffered from a steady population growth rate not in  proportion to that of the economic growth.    In the face of these problems, said the president, Egypt  began in the early eighties to comprehensively review its  economic programs and plans in line with the requirements of  modern economy, carrying out its economic reform programs in a  way compatible with its own social conditions and the needs of  Egyptian citizens.    He said that having executed two five-year economic plans  and  started a third one in 1992 and gradually adopted policies for  economic liberalization and privatization in accordance with  conditions of Egyptian society, Egypt has managed to restore the  vitality of the egyptian economy, and its ability to produce,  export and provide labor opportunities for thousands of young  people.    The problem is not over yet, but it was carefully diagnosed,  he said. The Egyptian economy, including industry, agriculture,  reconstruction and public services, began to appear healthy and  strong.    The president said that there is no little likeness between  Egypt's experiment and that of China, despite their  peculiarities. Shifting from centralized planning to the market  mechanism and individual enterprises is a characteristic of both  experiments.    But the fact the two experiments have taken into  consideration the social peculiarities of the Egyptian and  Chinese peoples, or "what we call the 'social dimension of  economic development'," is perhaps the most prominent  characteristic that they have in common, the president stressed.    Invigorating the public sector, establishing free economic  zones, encouraging foreign investments and developing medium and  small- sized industrial enterprises are characteristic of the  reforms in China, which can be found, though on a small scale,  in Egypt's economic reform experiment, Mubarak said.    Both the Egyptian and Chinese experiments reflect the  conditions of economic development in the two countries, they  are not a mechanical response to some plans or pieces of advice  that were not necessarily compatible with the characteristics of  the two experiments, said the Egyptian president.</p>

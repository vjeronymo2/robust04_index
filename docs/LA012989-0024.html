			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRITIC'S CORNER  </P> <P> One reason the Reagan presidency was so enjoyable is that Ronald Reagan  appeared to enjoy being President, and to enjoy one of the important duties of  that office -- being on television.  </P> <P> Jimmy Carter had seemed a whiner for whom the presidency was a burden and TV  appearances a painful chore. Gerald Ford was stiff and awkward on TV, and of  course Richard Nixon's political career had been one long wrestling match with  the camera, Nixon losing most of the falls.  </P> <P> Just because Reagan was so good on TV doesn't mean that only someone who's good  on TV can be elected President from now on. Could there be better proof of that  than his immediate successor? George Bush has had a moment here and there, but  . . .  </P> <P> The Reagan presidency may stand for years and years as the best television  production ever to originate from the White House. And not just because Reagan  had brilliant media advisers, though he did, nor because he was so often  propped up against scenic backdrops, though he was.  </P> <P> All the calculation and planning wouldn't have counted for diddly if Reagan  weren't Reagan, a nice man who looked into the tube and communicated  trustworthiness, optimism and a contagious resilience.  </P> <P> Reagan survived an assassination attempt, several operations, major scandals  like Iran-Contra, palace intrigues and a first-term recession. Yet most of the  time, when he appeared on TV, he looked spirited and hale, rejuvenated and  rejuvenating.  </P> <P> He wasn't going to let us see him looking defeated. And that helped keep us  from feeling defeated too. When Reagan told a joke, it was funny; it got a  laugh. He was the first President since John F. Kennedy with a sharp sense of  comic timing, and his humor was often generously self-deprecatory. He had the  galvanizing charm of F.D.R.  </P> <P> Maybe some people groaned when they heard the President was going to make a  prime-time visitation, but most people were pleased to see him. Reporters  clamored for more press conferences; the public did not. Ronald Reagan was  smart about many things, and one of them was not wearing out his welcome in the  American living room.  </P> <P> His farewell address to the nation sounded like a commercial. But then, it was,  even if there was nothing left to sell. Reagan's salesmanship is compulsive.  He'd really been more successful in his days as a TV pitchman than during his  years as a movie actor.  </P> <P> And in this speech he was saying, in effect, that the manufacturers' claims for  its product (his Administration) had been valid. He wanted to know he had left  the customer satisfied. Most of the customers, anyway.  </P> <P> Reagan brought something great to the office. He seemed mythic, and he returned  mythic status to the presidency, even with his guy-next-door manner. Hollywood  has been the nation's myth maker for most of this century, and Reagan didn't  mind exploiting movie imagery to make his points.  </P> <P> His appearance at Normandy for the anniversary of D-day was an unforgettable  emotional event. Pundits said it was "carefully choreographed." So what? The  most careful choreography in the world doesn't work unless the leading man can  bring it off. Reagan's choreographers had as easy a job as Fred Astaire's.  </P> <P> CNN televised, live, Reagan's farewell to the military at Andrews Air Force  Base. The bands stopped the marches long enough for one chorus of "Auld Lang  Syne." Reagan looked as though he were fighting back tears. It was a movie  scene, like John Wayne bidding adieu to the cavalry in John Ford's "She Wore a  Yellow Ribbon."  </P> <P> There is a reason these scenes work: They touch something deep in the human  soul.  </P> <P> Reagan also knew that to be a success on TV, you shouldn't over-define  yourself. You have to let viewers project onto you qualities they admire. When  some of us looked at Ronald Reagan, we saw our fathers and mothers, our  grandparents -- people who lived through the Great Depression and World War II  and knew a lot more about sacrifice and survival than we did.  </P> <P> This may be why Reagan was about as popular with younger voters as with older  ones. He was a link to times of nobler values, the ideals that heroes in old  movies fight for. Ronald Reagan let us believe in them again. His video  presidency was all about the magic of believing.  </P> <P> Many people saw and yet did not believe. But believing, at least a little, made  it a lot more fun.  </P></p>

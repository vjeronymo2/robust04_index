			<p><P> February 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KING FAN HAS READ THIS SCRIPT BEFORE  </P> <P> I've suffered with the Kings, or they have caused me to suffer, since 1967.  I've seen them make trade after trade, giving up draft choices or young talent  one after another.  </P> <P> Suddenly, there comes this expansion team called the New York Islanders whose  general manager says that he is going to build his team around young talent and  draft choices with patience.  </P> <P> A few years later, they obtained the services of one of the most popular Kings  ever, Butch Goring, on their way to four Stanley Cups.  </P> <P> Now, in their 23rd year, the Kings again have traded away their draft choices  and young talent, and the Islanders are again building like they did then, with  a lot of patience.  </P> <P> Guess who's going to win the Stanley Cup again long before the Kings are? You  guessed it.  </P> <P> PAUL SMIT, Glendale  </P></p>

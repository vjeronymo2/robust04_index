			<p>BFN     [Text] Kathmandu, June 20 (AFP) -- The supreme leader of  the ruling Nepali Congress party, Ganesh Man Singh, underwent an  urgent medical checkup here Monday [20 June] after collapsing at  Bharatpur airport, a party source said.    Singh, 79, was rushed to Kathmandu aboard an army helicopter  from Bharatpur in Chitwan district, 160 kilometres (100 miles)  southwest of here, after falling from a revolving chair and  suffering a dizzy spell, the source said.    He had been on a political tour campaigning against Prime  Minister Girija Prasad Koirala.    "The supreme leader has regained consciousness," the source  said.    A team of eight doctors is looking after Singh while another  group scanned the posterior part of his head and neck using a  CAT-Scan machine to check for internal bleeding, said the source.    Many of Singh's sympathizers gathered outside the hospital  to  inquire about his condition.</p>

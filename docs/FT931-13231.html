			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / Arts: Hampson sings Hamlet - Opera/Monte Carlo Ambroise Thomas's Hamlet (1874), one of the finest products of the 19th-century operatic second rank, has a star role for a lyric baritone of romantic presence, vocal magnetism and complete command of the French singing style. In our day it has served as a notable vehicle for Sherrill Milnes (who also recorded it) and Thomas Allen; the latest important protagonist is Thomas Hampson, the tall, handsome, greatly gifted American baritone mainly known up to now for his Mozart and Rossini roles (it is as the latter's Figaro that next month he makes a belated Covent Garden debut). His first approach to this operatic Shakespeare adaptation was wisely planned. It took place, last week, not in one of the big international opera houses where Mr Hampson has become a regular performer, but at Monte-Carlo. Here - away from the limelight, in Garnier's small jewel-box of a theatre - voices never have any need to press for audibility, contact between singers and audience is close, and the productions are cast and mounted with care and finesse. This was, indeed, not a One Man Show but an intelligently devised staging - by John Cox in the bold-coloured, strikingly modern-accented sets and costumes of Paul Brown (designer of the much-admired Royal Opera Mitridate)  -which increased even further my admiration for the whole work. In the later part of his career Thomas's name became a byword for passe traditionalism in French opera; Shaw's sallies against Hamlet - 'I really never saw such a foolish opera' - were sharp-pointed. At this date there is surely no longer any need to mind operatic Shakespeare in this pared-down form, with its far-from-conventional Happy End. The beauty of so much of the opera resides in the fastidiousness and precise purpose with which Thomas treated Grand Opera conventions. Numbers familiar out of context (Hamlet's monologues and Drinking Song, Ophelia's florid Mad Scene) gain miraculously from their surroundings. The distinct tone and colour of the orchestral writing show how much Thomas learned from Berlioz; and while there are big public scenes in the Meyerbeer manner, it is the combination of intimacy and seriousness that keeps them - and, indeed, the opera - so fresh and so surprising. Mr Hampson provided a noble centre point. His high baritone, near-tenorial in clarity and lightness of timbre, is an instrument of the utmost artistocratic elegance; so are his stage demeanour and his excellently schooled delivery of French. He has a Lieder-singer's gift of close focus, which lent a particular eloquence to Thomas's 'To be or not to be' and 'Get thou to a monastery' (with its wonderful blossoming as a trio). In the earlier acts he seemed self-absorbed, lacking a degree of emotional intensity and, with it, a quickness of reaction to the others on stage. But as the operatic momentum built up, so did the evidence of his engagement. If Mr Hampson should choose to make Hamlet a mainstay of his repertory, I predict for him an ever-growing success. I also predict a big future for the Ophelia, the very young Bulgarian Alexandrina Pendachanska (a recent WNO Gilda), whose highly individual soprano leggiero - needle-bright yet full of 'bottom' - is complemented by a heart-breaking innocence of stage personality. Stefania Toczyska (Gertrude) and Philippe Duminy (Claudius) both made much of their well-written roles. Lawrence Foster was the sound, secure, but sometimes rather unimaginative Monte-Carlo conductor, a little too free with the cutting shears.</p>

			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / 'Debt crisis has not gone away' BANKS and governments may be getting the upper hand over the third world debt crisis but it has not gone away and poor countries will have to fight to win more funds in coming years, the OECD said today, Reuter reports from Paris. 'The debt problem has certainly not been resolved nor has it at all gone away in any global sense,' the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said in its annual aid report. The Paris-based think-tank for the world's richest countries noted that while the crisis had eased in Latin America, where most of the main debtors are, problems for sub-Saharan Africa had worsened. Since government lenders were now looking much more closely at issues such as human rights and democracy when deciding which developing countries to help, political reforms must continue. These countries will need to persevere with economic liberalisation to attract private finance, since a big increase in official aid is unlikely soon. The OECD praised creditors for reaching landmark deals with some debtors. 'There have been clear improvements in a number of countries, which are now implementing better economic and structural adjustment policies, assisted by debt agreements. Nevertheless, the situation remains critical for many others.' The OECD applauded the debt deals reached with commercial banks by several Latin American countries  - including Mexico, which set off the debt crisis a decade ago  - saying these had played a part in turning round their economies. The Paris Club of government creditors has helped to bring a solution to the debt problem closer, particularly with its new policy of offering a deal on a country's total debt stock  - in effect, a promise to write off at least half of its debt  - if economic adjustment plans are adhered to.</p>

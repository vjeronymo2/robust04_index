			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Maria Wagrowska: "Signature on `Partnership'; </F> Prior to Prime Minister Pawlak's Visit to Brussels"]    [Text] The Council of Ministers is scheduled to make  a decision today on whether Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak will  sign a document committing Poland to joining the program of  cooperation with NATO known as "Partnership for Peace" during  his visit to NATO Headquarters in Brussels tomorrow. The  government's decisions to date justify a supposition that this  kind of authorization will indeed be formulated for the prime  minister, said Andrzej Olechowski, Poland's chief diplomat,  during Monday's [31 January] press conference at the Office of  the Council of Ministers.    Olechowski stated he will submit a motion to the government  requesting that it approve a resolution authorizing the prime  minister to sign the document. Observers deem the Council of  Ministers' acceptance as virtually certain, although, as is  widely known, Poland has reservations with regard to  "Partnership for Peace" because it says the program provides no  guarantees for future membership of our country in the Western  alliance. In a separate conversation with RZECZPOSPOLITA, Jerzy  Milewski, who is chief of the National Security Bureau and first  deputy defense minister, said he believes the Council of  Ministers will give the prime minister a "green light" enabling  him to sign a so-called document of principles, in which the  West outlined the main principles of the "Partnership" and which  contains an invitation to take part in the program. Specific  issues regarding NATO-Poland cooperation will be worked out  during consultations which are to begin shortly.    Both "Partnership for Peace" and general relations with NATO  are scheduled to be one of the main topics discussed during the  prime minister's visit to Brussels, as well as during a meeting  with the new first deputy secretary general of NATO, Sergio  Silvio Balanzino of Italy (Manfred Woerner is seriously ill).    During the second day of the visit (3 February), Waldemar  Pawlak will present a lecture at a conference organized by the  Washington-based Strategic and International Research Center.  The topic of the lecture will be the security of Poland and  Europe in general. The prime minister will also be a guest of  Professor Zbigniew Brzezinski. Regardless of the prime  minister's participation, some personalities from Polish  political life are also scheduled to take part in the Brussels  conference--for instance, Professor Bronislaw Geremek. Polish  National Bank Chairwoman Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz will be a  representative of the Polish economic sector.    Apart from that, Waldemar Pawlak also, as the first Polish  prime minister to do so, will meet with Willem van Eekelen,  secretary general of the Western European Union.    During the unofficial part of the prime minister's visit to  Brussels, some talks are also scheduled with EC Chairman Jacques  Delors and also with European Parliament Chairman Egon Klepsch.  The prime minister's associates, however, refused to let  journalists know what specific topics would be discussed during  the talks. All they said was that the new prime minister's  second trip abroad (following the Prague summit with the U.S.  and Visegrad countries' presidents) is supposed to emphasize  Poland's efforts toward integration with the West, and that the  visit is associated with the fact that on 1 February Poland's  treaty of association with the European Union becomes effective.</p>

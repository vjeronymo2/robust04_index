			<p><P> February 6, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE TO HEAR LAWSUIT TODAY OVER GOP USE OF POLL GUARDS  </P> <P> After 2 months of partisan charges and countercharges, a lawsuit challenging  the Orange County Republican Party's decision to station uniformed security  guards at polling places in 20 largely Latino precincts on Election Day is to  go before a federal judge today.  </P> <P> In U.S. District Court in Santa Ana, Judge J. Spencer Letts will hear motions  to dismiss the lawsuit, which was brought by Latino groups, a laborers' union  and several individuals.  </P> <P> Among the defendants are the county and state Republican Party organizations,  county Republican Party Chairman Thomas A. Fuentes and Assemblyman Curt Pringle  (R-Garden Grove).  </P> <P> Pringle won the 72nd Assembly District election in November over Democrat  Christian F. (Rick) Thierbach by 867 votes. All 20 Santa Ana voting precincts  to which the guards were sent are in the 72nd District.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Local Democrats Keep Issue Alive  </P> <P> On another front, county Democrats resolved last week to ask for up to $100,000  from the state Democratic Party at its convention next weekend in Sacramento to  pay for an attempt to recall Pringle because of the guards incident. While the  resolution is given little chance of passing, it has served as a rallying point  for local Democrats who want to keep the issue alive.  </P> <P> Fuentes and others involved in hiring the guards have said they were a  necessary precaution because of rumors that Democrats might try to bus illegal  voters into the 72nd District to tip the election to Thierbach.  </P> <P> The Latino groups' lawsuit alleges that the guards, who were carrying signs in  Spanish admonishing non-citizens not to vote, intimidated first-time Latino  voters and may have frightened them away from the polls. It asks that election  results in the district be overturned.  </P> <P> "They found the weakest link in our party," Stanton City Councilman Sal Sapien  told Democrats meeting last week in Santa Ana. "Here we have people who are  going to vote for the first time in their lives, who are normally intimidated  by uniforms. . . . So therefore, the first time they get to the polling place,  they have these people in uniforms asking them for ID, asking them for  registration, asking them if they are citizens of the United States. And many  of them had a hard time understanding what it was all about."  </P> <P> Letts, who was appointed to the federal bench during the Reagan presidency,  will hear arguments on whether the plaintiffs have standing to sue over the  guards.  </P> <P> He will also weigh the defendants' assertions that no actual harm can be shown  because there is no proof that anyone actually failed to vote because of the  guards.  </P> <P> But even if this assertion is so, plaintiffs' attorney Kathleen Purcell argued  in papers filed with the court, "the right to vote . . . encompasses more than  merely the right to mark a ballot. It includes within its scope the right to be  free from coercion, intimidation and retaliation for exercising the franchise."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sapien Leads Movement  </P> <P> The county Democratic Party's effort to get a Pringle recall movement afoot has  been led by Sapien.  </P> <P> "If we can commit the state party to do something about this, we have a better  chance of redressing the issue," Sapien said at a Democratic Central Committee  meeting last week. "Even if it's $1,000, whatever it is. . . ."  </P> <P> But so far the recall idea has brought a tepid response from Democratic  leaders.  </P> <P> Assembly Speaker Pro Tem Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles) said he thinks it is good  that Democrats are keeping the guards issue before public, "but in terms of it  becoming a major Democratic effort . . . I don't think that's to be."  </P> <P> Susan Jetton, spokeswoman for Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco),  said Brown is "appalled and displeased" over the use of the guards and "the  implied blocking of people's right to vote."  </P> <P> She added, however, that "we haven't seen any evidence that it made a  difference in the outcome" of the election. "Barring that evidence, I don't  know what could be done."  </P> <P> But Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), who helped Thierbach run his campaign,  said the recall effort is "a way to remind people that just because the  election is over with, people still have to take responsibility for their  actions, whether it's Curt Pringle or Tom Fuentes."  </P> <P> County Democratic Party Chairman Mike Balmages said local Democrats would like  to get money from the state party organization to use for the recall "or  alternatively on a very early start on taking back the seat in 1990."  </P> <P> Balmages, responding to earlier criticism by Fuentes that the guards issue was  being used for partisan politics, agreed.  </P> <P> "I think he's right," Balmages said. "I think it is a partisan political  issue."  </P> <P> But he added, "We ought not to let the people who perpetrated it . . . get away  with it."  </P> <P> Fuentes could not be reached for comment about recent developments.  </P></p>

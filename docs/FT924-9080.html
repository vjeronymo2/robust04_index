			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Fees of Pounds 1m a week 'a scandal' FEES charged by the accountants and lawyers involved in winding-up Bank of Credit and Commerce International are amounting to about Pounds 1m a week, Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury, told the Commons yesterday. Mr Keith Vaz, Labour MP for Leicester East, who has headed the campaign on behalf of BCCI depositors and staff, described the liquidators' fees as 'a scandal'. He said: 'They are becoming rich on the victims' money while the government stands by and watches.' Mr Nelson emphasised the importance of the liquidators, and said that it would be improper for the government to 'lean on them' in any way. To date, he said, the liquidators' fees and expenses had amounted to about Pounds 69m. The fees to date include Pounds 28m incurred before the winding-up order on January 14 this year, and a further Pounds 48m incurred since then, Mr Nelson said. Legal authorisation has been secured for the payment of fees up to April 15. Since then, the liquidators had drawn on account fees which had yet to be formally approved, but with the authority of the court and with the approval of the creditors' committee. Mr Nelson added that legal and other professional fees amounted to some Pounds 22m.</p>

			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: ACIDIC OR SALTY FOODS CAN DRAW ALUMINUM OUT OF POTS, PANS  </P> <P> Question: I recently purchased a used set of aluminum pots and pans. One friend  has told me I should not use them because I'd get Alzheimer's disease.  </P> <P> Another friend says, "Although doctors say Alzheimer's patients have aluminum  in their brains, aluminum cannot be absorbed from eating food cooked in  aluminum pots."  </P> <P> Which should I believe? I don't think I want to use these pans until I get your  advice. If there hasn't been enough testing, so that no one is sure, I wonder  if I should take the chance.  </P> <P> Answer: No one yet knows whether aluminum predisposes one to Alzheimer's  disease or if the accumulation of the mineral in the brain is a secondary  consequence of the disease.  </P> <P> Our only caution would be to avoid cooking acidic or salty foods, which can  pull aluminum from the pots and pans. This element can be absorbed from food so  tomato sauces or sauerkraut, for example, would be verboten.  </P> <P> Q. When you wrote recently about home remedies for cold sores, why in heaven's  name didn't you tell people about l-lysine?  </P> <P> For 50 years I would develop fever blisters every time I went out in the sun.  About four years ago a pharmacist told me about l-lysine. Since then I have  taken it for a week before I know I'll be exposed to sunshine. I have not had a  cold sore since.  </P> <P> A. We were flooded with letters like yours praising the power of l-lysine. One  young woman wrote, "My boyfriend got these sores constantly, and as a last  resort we went to the health food store to see if there was anything that could  help. He was told to take lysine, and the sores have never returned."  </P> <P> Another reader reported suffering from nasty fever blisters that lasted three  or four weeks. She was told by a friend to take lysine, and when she was  skeptical, the friend said, "Then live with them if you're stubborn."  </P> <P> She now takes l-lysine whenever she feels a cold sore coming on or if she is in  the sun more than usual. She says, "It quickly nips them in the bud. Doctors  and druggists don't seem to believe this, but I know it works."  </P> <P> Though it may not work for everyone, this amino acid may be worth a try.  </P></p>

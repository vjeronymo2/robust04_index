			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEBANON  </P> <P> In response to "Beirut Reels Under Savage Shelling; 16 Killed, 53 Hurt," Part  I, Page 16, May 9:  </P> <P> The article states: "Remorseless artillery fire battered Beirut . . . most  savage shelling of Lebanon . . . 2,000 shells, rockets, mortars . . . nearly  two-month battle . . . 316 dead and 1,184 injured . . . hospitals, schools . .  . hit in relentless eight-hour barrage. . . ."  </P> <P> The Christian sector is being decimated by some 20,000-30,000 Syrian occupying  forces along with Syrian-backed Lebanese Muslims. All this under the guise of  Syria's occupation being that of "the settling police force" to keep the peace  in Lebanon.  </P> <P> Where are Christian leaders raising their voices anywhere in the world  (including the Pope) to help stave off the massacre of their fellow Christians?  Why haven't Arab brothers and sisters anywhere in the world become vocal on  behalf of their fellow Arabs?  </P> <P> Have we witnessed any emergency sessions within the United Nations to condemn  the slaughter of Arabs by other Arabs? Why? Why? No daily words from the press  on front pages or television strongly condemning this genocide. The silence is  terrifying!  </P> <P> Apparently, the death of an Arab only becomes meaningful and worthy of  headlines and international condemnation when a Jewish Israeli pulls the  trigger.  </P> <P> DAVID BECK  </P> <P> Sherman Oaks  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 15 (YONHAP) -- Wu Xueqian, vice  chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference, hinted at the possibility of revising the Chinese  school textbooks that claim South Korea attacked the North to  trigger the Korean war (1950-53) during his recent visit, but  education authorities see little coming of it.    Since ties were normalized in August 1992, South Korean and  Chinese textbook editors have discussed correcting inaccurate  accounts of the other's country in school textbooks at several  seminars, but failed to reach any agreement, Education Ministry  officials said Friday.    One Chinese textbook reads: "A war erupted in Choson  (Korea).  American imperialists invaded the North."    Seoul wants it stated clearly that a Southward invasion took  place, but Beijing is unwilling because it would mean China  supported the invader.    The Chinese communists apparently wanted to assert they  helped the North Koreans because a northward push by the  Americans could have threatened their country, justifying their  involvement in the war.    For Beijing's part, it wants Seoul to indicate that  Manchuria  belongs to its northeastern region and Taiwan is one of its  provinces.    These disagreements make it unlikely that China will correct  its textbooks anytime in the near future, officials here said.    The ministry, nonetheless, will continue to invite Chinese  textbook editors to seminars and hold more discussions.</p>

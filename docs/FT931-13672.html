			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / A victim of its own success: The enhanced role of the UN has raised new questions about its goals and resources Not since the first postwar years has the prestige of the United Nations stood so high in the western world. When great powers wish to take military action they now justify it by reference to UN Security Council resolutions. When they wish not to take military action, the absence of such resolutions is the first argument they use. When defining the role of their armed forces, western leaders put peacekeeping high on the list of tasks, and refer to the 'primacy', or the 'invaluable experience' of the UN in this field. When they seek a political solution to regional conflicts, they almost instinctively write in a UN role. Some of them even refer cautiously, but without dismissing it out of hand, to the possibility of placing recalcitrant countries such as Bosnia and Somalia under long-term UN administration. Such expectations and demands have thrust the UN into the limelight, but are also subjecting it to enormous strain. So much so that senior figures in the Secretariat are beginning to wonder if it is up to the job. That implies a criticism directed partly at themselves and the bureaucracy they run, but partly at the Security Council and its permanent members, from whom most of the demands come. A running theme of such criticism is that the member states are not giving the UN the resources - financial and human - to do the job required of it. The secretary general, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, has been struggling with these problems since he took over a year ago. He began by a restructuring of the Secretariat itself, drastically reducing the number of under-secretary generals (USGs) and regrouping the Secretariat's activities in large departments, each headed by a USG directly answerable to him. Four of these departments are directly concerned with the security issues which the western world, at least, regards as the UN's central responsibility. Mr Jan Eliasson, a Swedish diplomat who worked closely with the late Olof Palme, notably in his efforts to end the Iran-Iraq war, deals with humanitarian affairs. Mr Marrack Goulding, formerly British ambassador in Angola, retains the peacekeeping portfolio he inherited from Sir Brian Urquhart in 1986. Preventive diplomacy and 'peacemaking' are shared, on a regional basis, between Mr James Jonah of Sierra Leone, an old UN hand, who deals with Africa and the Middle East, and Mr Vladimir Petrovsky, once (as Soviet deputy foreign minister) the main articulator of Mikhail Gorbachev's vision for the UN and now the UN's own top diplomat for Europe, Asia and the Americas. All four are heavily overworked, partly because on any issue of importance Mr Boutros Ghali insists on dealing with them personally rather than with their subordinates. But probably the greatest burden falls on Mr Goulding. Peacekeeping, a concept not mentioned in the UN charter, and indeed largely invented by the UN during the cold war, has now become ragingly fashionable. The essence of it is that small, lightly armed military forces are interposed between the combatants in a war, with the consent of both parties, as part of a ceasefire agreement: a confidence-building measure, enabling each side to feel confident that the other will not launch a surprise attack. The agreement may also call on the military groups to collect weapons from both sides, and sometimes to undertake temporary policing or administrative tasks, such as the supervision of elections. Such forces are understood to be impartial and are not expected to take any part in fighting; their arms are to be used only in self-defence. So great has been the demand for peacekeeping forces that the number under Mr Goulding's command quintupled last year; these forces now number close to 60,000. But his own administrative staff at UN headquarters has increased only from 10 to 15. They are at once gratified and embarrassed by their inability to match the large teams of staff officers sent to talk to them from much larger military bureaucracies, such as Nato and the Pentagon, which are now keen to get in on the peacekeeping business. The US has offered Mr Goulding various forms of electronic hardware - 'real-time' communications systems, for instance, and a 24-hour operations room - which he has so far hesitated to accept, apparently doubting whether he and his staff have the capacity to manage such sophisticated machinery. Meanwhile, he works a 14- or 15-hour day, seven days a week, and is visibly wilting under the strain. Out of five important UN operations in 1992, four - in Angola, Cambodia, Somalia and the former Yugoslavia - have either failed or are in serious trouble, not mainly through technical failures by the peacekeepers but because of unresolved political problems. Even the one success story, in El Salvador, now seems threatened by the refusal of President Alfredo Cristiani to dismiss some officers, including his defence minister, who have been identified as responsible for atrocities. Part of the trouble, it seems, is lack of effective liaison between departments. In Bosnia and Somalia the UN's objectives have been defined as humanitarian, yet because military forces are involved the main organisational load falls on Mr Goulding's department. In Angola and Cambodia the political agreements on which the operation is based are falling apart; one might think it was the job of Mr Jonah and Mr Petrovsky, respectively, to prevent this happening, but their departments do not seem to have been sufficiently involved, or at an early enough stage. Mr Boutros Ghali himself is believed to be unhappy about the way things are working, and may soon attempt a further reorganisation. He has certainly ruffled feathers in the Secretariat by saying repeatedly that until he came to New York he imagined his own country, Egypt, had the worst bureaucracy in the world, but now he knows the UN is even worse. Yet he would be the last person to suggest that the UN's problems are purely organisational. In his Agenda for Peace report, published last June, he showed himself aware that there were situations in which traditional peacekeeping is not enough, and suggested the creation of 'peace-enforcement units', more heavily armed than traditional peacekeepers and authorised to use force in cases where 'cease-fires have . . . been agreed but not complied with'. Last September, in his first annual report to the General Assembly, he highlighted the problems that arise when peacekeeping forces have to deal with 'non-governmental entities or irregular groups', whose shadowy leaders may sign agreements but either cannot or will not impose compliance on their followers. As the UN is drawn into more and more internal conflicts within member states, these problems are multiplying. Events in Bosnia and Somalia, especially, have blurred the distinction between peacekeeping and enforcement, between humanitarian assistance and military confrontation. In a different way the same has happened in Iraq, where the UN is still trying to enlist the consent and assistance of President Saddam Hussein's regime in relief operations aimed at helping people it has identified as victims of that same regime, and in some cases at mitigating the effects of sanctions it has itself imposed. Talking to senior UN officials about Mr Saddam, or about Somali or Bosnian Serb warlords, one can sense that they are uncertain whether to adopt the tone of an affronted authority thumping the table, or that of a patient and neutral 'honest broker'. The latter pose is one that many of them instinctively adopt, having learnt it during the long years of the cold war when neutrality was the only attitude that allowed the UN any role at all. But arguably the former is more in keeping with the charter, and more appropriate to the role the UN is coming to play in the new world order. To play that role effectively, the UN needs expanded resources, a more radically restructured organisation, and above all perhaps a clearer definition of its various tasks and how they relate to each other. In all three areas the new US administration, which has advertised its enthusiasm for the UN, should have an important contribution to make. The challenge to President Clinton, and to his UN ambassador, Madeleine Albright, is to find a way of doing that without reinforcing the already widespread view among non-western member states, and among their nationals in the Secretariat, that the western powers have turned the UN into nothing more than an instrument of their own political whims.</p>

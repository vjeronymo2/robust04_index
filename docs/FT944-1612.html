			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Survey of the Czech Republic (9): Vitkovice is afloat without a life-raft - Steel industry Communists in general, and Comrade Stalin in particular, were obsessed with steel. It was an obsession that lumbered former Czechoslovakia with dozens of smoky steel plants, and an enormous industrial restructuring problem when communism fell. The Czech Republic alone has over 20 steel and metallurgy companies, and many will not survive. Vitkovice, the republic's largest integrated steel and engineering complex, is determined to be one that will pull through. Mr Jaroslav Dusilek, Vitkovice's finance director says bluntly: 'We will not close down.' Two years ago, he was not so sure. Like much of Czech heavy industry Vitkovice, based in Ostrova, northern Moravia, had drawn up a reconstruction plan which relied heavily on government funding. But soon after the June 1992 elections, the new government, headed by Mr Vaclav Klaus, made it abundantly clear that such companies would have to swim along without the aid of a government life-raft. Vitkovice, which has to produce at an optimal level of 1m tons of steel and core products to survive, was forced to jump in at the deep end. It has already shed 16,000 employees since 1989 and its current workforce of 23,000 is targeted to fall to 18,000 by the end of the decade. While reducing the labour force, mainly through voluntary retirement, it is also planning to reduce its dependency on steel production and boost its engineering division. The company has invested Kc1.5bn a year since 1992, much of it on a Kc2.4bn continuous slab caster to modernise steel production. But it is also saddled with heavy environmental costs, currently Kc200m annually, to reduce hazardous discharges and waste. Mr Dusilek claims that Ostrava, a bleak industrial city of 330,000 people dominated by the sprawling Vitkovice plant, is 'cleaner than Prague'. Yet neither is particularly clean, though better than they were in communist times when ecological concerns were not an overriding factor. Steel production currently accounts for 56 per cent of Vitkovice's total output, but is scheduled to decline to 45 per cent by 2003, according to a new strategic plan which has just hit Mr Dusilek's desk. The company's main product is hot rolled thick plates used in shipbuilding and boilers. It also makes long products such as seamless tubes used by the oil industry. Its engineering division, which currently accounts for 30 per cent of total production, concentrates on marine crankshafts, of which it claims to be one of the two leading world producers with 16 per cent of the global market. It also makes components for nuclear power plants, and was the main supplier of such products to Soviet-designed reactors until 1989. Since the collapse of Comecon, Vitkovice has had to fight hard for new markets. This has inevitably brought it into conflict with western steel producers, which invoked anti-dumping clauses to restrict exports of seamless tubes and other products to European Union markets. Mr Dusilek denies allegations that Czech and Slovak steel makers, and seamless tube producers in particular, are guilty of dumping products in the EU. When lower labour costs and depreciation are excluded, 'all our costs are at international market levels,' he says. The biggest proportion of Vitkovice's output is still consumed by local engineering industries. But the company now exports 47 per cent of total production, of which 55 per cent goes to the EU, mainly Germany, and a third to Slovakia. Until the collapse of communism 30 per cent of the company's production, mainly engineering products, was exported to Comecon markets, with the rest sold domestically. The great difference today is that its new customers pay for what they receive. Vitkovice lost Kc1bn in 1993 after being forced to write off unpaid debts by former Soviet customers. Meanwhile, Vitkovice is benefiting from the end of the recession in the steel industry worldwide which is pushing up export prices and volumes. Profits this year are expected to reach Kc400m. In the 10 months to October, it reported turnover of Kc18bn and sales of Kc12.7bn, of which Kc6bn was exported. Rising profitability is essential if the company is to earn enough to complete its restructuring plans. Much of Czech heavy industry is still largely state-owned, but the recently completed second wave of coupon privatisation included blocks of shares in many 'difficult' industries, including steel. Vitkovice was included in the wave, with almost 25 per cent of the company's shares sold to private investors. Another 5 per cent is owned by the city of Ostrava, which depends on the company for its own survival. The state retains two-thirds. Vitkovice has tried to woo a partner among western steel companies, and hired UBS Phillips &amp; Drew in 1992 to draw up an 'information memorandum' to sell the company's divisions to potential investors, including British Steel and Thyssen. That move coincided with the worst of the recession in the world steel industry, and so far there have been no takers. Vitkovice is now trying to secure long-term co-operation agreements which may include an equity partnership. It is hoping that the improved international outlook for the steel industry will help. What potential investors will be buying into is the Czech Republic's third biggest company, with a colourful past and a potentially prosperous future as industrial growth resumes, provided it can complete its modernisation while its low cost base gives it a price advantage. It may be the only steel company in the world to have been founded by an archbishop. In 1828 Rudolf Jan, archbishop of Olomouc in central Moravia, built a smelter in Vitkovice, which was then a tiny village. Jan was a member of the Hapsburg dynasty, and owned ore mines in Sweden and coal mines in the Ostrava region. The plant was bought in 1843 by a branch of the Rothschild family, and remained in their hands until it was seized by the Nazis in 1939. The state of Czechoslovakia settled with the Rothschilds in 1947, so that Vitkovice was not subject to restitution after the Velvet Revolution. Earlier this month, the Rothschild family resumed its severed connection with the Czechs when Sir Evelyn de Rothschild came to Prague to sign a joint venture agreement between NM Rothschild and Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka. For Vitkovice such agreements could augur foreign investor interest even in sectors such as steel, where the future looked so bleak three years ago.</p>

			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Technology: From inspiration to bestseller - Andrew Fisher ends a series on innovation by asking why Britain's performance lags behind other countries IF ALL the words written on innovation in the past few years were translated into performance, Britain would have one of the most successful economies in the world. Innovation has been the subject of numerous seminars, speeches and publications, with industry exhorted to shake itself up and develop the ideas, products and strategies needed to come out ahead in international markets. There is no doubt the UK has plenty of corporate winners, especially in sectors such as pharmaceuticals, retailing and some parts of manufacturing - aerospace, electronics and engineering. But the country also seems to have more than its fair share of plodders and losers. Innovation and competitiveness are hard to measure, but the UK does poorly in world league tables by most statistical yardsticks. While that much is indisputable, there is a good deal of disagreement about the causes of this lagging performance and possible ways to put it right. Industrialists, academics and economists generally agree, however, that the process of innovation is hard to define. Nor are there any easy models for innovation-hungry companies to follow. 'Just having innovative technology is not enough to claim true innovation,' Akio Morita, chairman of Sony, the Japanese electronics concern, said in a lecture to The Royal Society. Also required is creativity in both product planning and marketing. 'Innovative management demands that all phases of the operation be seen as links in a single chain of innovation.' Scientific endeavour is clearly an important element in most innovation, but it is by no means the only or dominant factor. Howard Newby, chairman of the Economic and Social Research Council, says: 'Innovation does not automatically spring from scientific invention and go on inevitably to produce a competitive edge for companies.' Josef Schumpeter, the Austrian-born economist, described three phases of technological change: invention, or the discovery of new ideas and methods; innovation, which means making these commercially useful; and diffusion, the spreading of the resulting products and processes to available markets. Economic study has shown that more than 80 per cent of US productivity growth in the first half of this century stemmed from technological innovation. In Britain today, the economy suffers from the lack of a strong technological base, according to Paul Stoneman, a professor at Warwick Business School. 'Unless the UK invests more heavily in new technology, it will not be able to generate the extra productivity and new products that it needs to compete successfully in international markets and will continue its relative decline.' Corporate research and development declined in Britain as a percentage of gross domestic product in the 1980s, but rose in Germany, Japan, the US and France. ICI, Britain's top spender on research and development, is 35th in world terms, with Glaxo, the second biggest UK R&amp;D spender, in 49th place. In Stoneman's opinion, the UK's relatively poor performance results from the government's short-term policies of demand stimulation and use of interest rates as a policy weapon - both leading to economic volatility - the short-term view taken on capital markets, the shortage of skilled workers and over-reliance by the government on market forces. Recently, the government has tried to become more supportive of industry. Stoneman believes the forthcoming White Paper on Science and Technology 'could revolutionise policy towards the stimulation of Britain's technological base'. Even if this does occur, the need to manage and control ideas and invention will remain a priority. Companies which blaze new scientific and technological trails do not always succeed commercially. One of several telling examples cited by John Kay, professor of economics at the London Business School, is EMI, the British company which pioneered the CAT scanner in medical technology, but then ran into financial troubles. Philips, the Dutch electronics group, has developed original products such as the audio cassette and the compact disc. Today, its finances are in disarray. In his new book, Foundations of Corporate Success, Kay makes the point that innovation needs to be accompanied by other types of competence such as management, marketing and organisational strength and flexibility. Also, technology can be copied. 'Innovation is, by its very nature, costly and uncertain,' he writes. It is also hard to manage. Kay warns against putting too much faith in technology at the expense of other skills. 'A common business mistake is to believe that innovation can compensate for competitive disadvantages in other areas. Such a strategy is almost never effective.' Reputation is important in persuading people to buy innovative products, Kay adds. 'Customers will buy untried Sony products because of the strength of Sony's innovative record.' Interestingly, Morita uses the example of the Walkman portable cassette player to show that successful products do not have to be technologically advanced, even in electronics. 'Frankly, it did not contain any breakthrough technology. Its success was based on product planning and marketing.' It is this emphasis on the marketability of innovative products, backed up by management and other skills, that the Department of Industry, the Confederation of British Industry, the ESRC (independent, but government-backed) and other innovation-minded organisations are keen to promote in Britain. The DTI and CBI have begun a programme which seeks to tell companies how best to change their ways; a study last year found only one-tenth of UK concerns were truly innovative, though half showed some of the right elements. 'One of the problems we have is overcoming inertia,' comments Joe Carr, one of five industrialists seconded to the DTI's innovation unit - in his case from TI Group. 'We've got to catch the hearts and minds of chief executives.' He believes UK companies should be more open in the way they exchange and share technology and ideas and also be more willing to enter into alliances with other companies to enhance product and market strength. Communication, both inside companies and outside to investors, suppliers and consumers, is widely seen as essential to successful innovation. Richard Scase, professor of organisational behaviour at Kent University, thinks UK companies - especially in manufacturing - often fall down badly here. 'People in the manufacturing process often don't see innovation as part of their responsibility and concentrate on production only.' Many R&amp;D departments also operate in partial isolation from the rest of the company - 'the traditional argument is that boffins must be kept away from the coal face'. In the view of John Fisher, technical director at PA Consulting Group, many companies - not just in the UK - do not use their R&amp;D talents properly. 'They've got cupboards full of ideas that no one appreciates,' he says. 'It's not so much a question of spending more or less on R&amp;D, it's one of maximising effectiveness.' Yet that is easier said than done. 'It can be very difficult to know if you have a winner or not,' says Ian Harvey, chief executive of British Technology Group, which licenses products around the world. It was 10 years before magnetic resonance imaging, the latest-generation body scanner developed from academic research, became successful in the medical equipment market. Innovation requires vision, courage and persistence as well as technological and management expertise. Failures are inevitable in the drive to find winning products, but that is part of the price for seeking to turn inspiration into success in the world market place.</p>

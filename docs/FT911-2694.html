			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (7): Hit by costs of unity - The D-Mark BUOYED throughout last year by the psychological and interest rate effects of German unification, the D-Mark has suddenly started to wobble. It is now over a year ago that domestic bond yields climbed nearly 2 per cent (to the 9 per cent mark for ten-year paper), as investors, primarily those abroad, sold heavily in anticipation of the vast, but then quite unknown, cost of unification. The equity market suffered later in the year, as eastern euphoria melted into sober assessments of how distant the benefits and how immediate the costs would be. During that time, the foreign exchange markets chose to ignore such concerns, both as regards east Germany and with respect to events further east, including in the Soviet Union - the latter typically having a strong, if primarily psychological, effect on the currency's fortunes. Since February, when the dollar touched a low of just under DM1.45, there has been a rapid - some would say exaggerated - reversal in the relative assessment of the economic prospects of the US and Germany on the foreign exchanges. While the end of the Gulf war toned up US consumer confidence markedly, other more concrete factors, including a pronounced narrowing of the trade deficit, have bolstered the dollar. Meanwhile the D-Mark's softness - which must not, given most estimates of purchasing power parity between the two currencies at over DM2 to the dollar, be exaggerated - appears to be more than the mirror image of the dollar's current strength. The D-Mark has weakened considerably within the EMS since earlier in the year, when talk was of realignment strains because of its buoyancy. It has also slipped noticeably against the yen. What has happened is delineated on one level in the political headlines, as the 'unity chancellor', discredited by his reversal of policy on taxes, is now charged with having seriously underestimated the scope of the task of bringing east Germany to its feet. Returning to the new Lander at the beginning of April for the first time since the federal elections in December, Mr Helmut Kohl was bombarded not with cheers but with eggs for his inability to bring last year's fulsome promises true. In spite of transfers of around DM100bn from west to east this year, sharply rising unemployment and falling living standards provoke social unrest, and the point at which the east German economy is expected to turn the corner, if anything, recedes. For the Bundesbank, unification has represented a continual struggle to emerge with its prized political independence untarnished. At present it is not winning the battle as comfortably as it (or foreign D-Mark investors) would like. From the point at which the Bonn government imposed the terms of currency union with the east - in the highly generous conversion recently dubbed 'a disaster' by Bundesbank president Mr Karl Otto Pohl - the central bank has had to fight hard to preserve its formidable reputation. Most recently, the tussle between Frankfurt and Bonn over the composition of the post-unification Bundesbank - which must be resolved by October - has left markets wondering whether Mr Pohl's keeness to win political acceptance of a slimmed down policy-making council, with considerably less power to the Lander, may not create indirect strains on current policy-making. More obviously, the levers of monetary control are far more difficult to operate in the enlarged Germany. Inflation, still only 2.5 per cent in March, is set to increase, partly as a result of the hefty tax surcharge coming into effect from July. Moreover, the current wage round is proving more acrimonious than expected - not helped by the imminent tax increases - with average settlements likely to be in the 7 per cent range, representing almost a doubling of unit labour costs compared with last year. A weaker currency would also have an additional inflationary effect, although it is too early for the increased costs to have fed through in the monthly price numbers. Another factor affecting the foreign exchange market's perception of the D-Mark is the speed with which the pan-German economy has slipped into current account deficit (in January and February) after years of west German surpluses dating back to the early 1980s. The demand surge prompted by unification has sucked in imports, while many of Germany's traditional exporters have found major overseas markets weak or recession-bound. The current account surplus (DM104bn in 1989 and DM71bn last year for west Germany) may be in deficit in 1991 across the united country. While this reallocation of capital from abroad to the domestic market is precisely what is required to effect the task in hand, the spectre of a current account deficit tends to spook currency markets. Finally, the record public sector borrowing requirement - officially DM150bn this year - is taken as a further symptom of the economy's changed nature. Even with the tax increases, some investors fear that official targets could be exceeded, and the Bonn government is besieged by criticism, from its central bank as well as elsewhere, over its inability to cut public expenditure in the west. Economists suggest one reason why the Bundesbank, having nudged official rates up by half a percentage point at the beginning of this year, has so far resisted responding to the D-Mark's slippage by a further tightening. As the risk premium of holding D-Marks is seen to increase, the authorities can fall into the trap of initiating a defensive move that merely keeps the D-Mark constant - with a much heftier move being necessary to restore a previous rate. Unlike in February, where the industrialised nations were prepared to intervene in support of the dollar, there is no such consensus for the reverse action. One by-product of Germany's domestic problems has been a reduction in the influence of the D-Mark within the EMS. At the turn of the year, the strength of the currency was causing tension within the system, and the rate rise at the beginning of February unleashed a storm of international protest at what was seen to be an unneighbourly move given the opposite trend to lower interest rates elsewhere. In spite of that move, however, countries including Spain and Britain have been able to continue lowering their official rates as the D-mark has slipped for reasons other than those connected with pure interest rate differentials. If Germany sees that as undesirable, its neighbours on the whole do not. In sum, the foreign exchange's preoccupation with the mounting burdens of unification - ignoring both the continued strong growth in the western part of the economy and the undiminished long-term prospects - are no more logical than last year's gravity defying optimism. The mood can swing as quickly again.</p>

			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / International Company News: BHP closer to winning control of NZ Steel FISHER &amp; PAYKEL and Steel &amp; Tube Holdings, two members of the consortium controlling New Zealand Steel, have agreed to sell their 25 per cent shareholdings to BHP. Their agreements, announced yesterday, are central to BHP gaining control of NZ Steel, operator of the big Glenbrook mill near Auckland, a big exporter of steel products to Australia. BHP has a 31 per cent shareholding. Both agreements to sell, however, are subject to approval from the Australian Trade Practice Commission (ATPC) and the New Zealand Commerce Commission. In 1989, the ATPC strongly opposed BHP gaining control of NZ Steel. It said then that high tariff barriers meant that NZ Steel was one of BHP's few competitors. Fisher &amp; Paykel and Steel &amp; Tube became partners in NZ Steel in 1989 as part of the BHP-led consortium that bought the company from collapsed Equiticorp for NZDollars 323m (USDollars 177.5m). Steel &amp; Tube is 49 per cent owned by Tubemakers of Australia, which is in turn 49.8 per cent owned by BHP. The fourth member is the ANZ Bank, with 19 per cent. Yesterday, ANZ said it had not received an offer, but 'would be happy to receive' one. This week, BHP said NZ Steel needed a further capital injection - partly to reduce debt - which it was prepared to commit. However, the other partners were unwilling to do so because of poor returns. All partners in the consortium have invested in preference shares in NZ Steel since 1989, and both Fisher &amp; Paykel and Steel &amp; Tube said they had agreed to sell these to BHP. Fisher &amp; Paykel said it would receive NZDollars 47.75m for its preference shares, but no other figures have been disclosed on the proposed purchase price.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The government has decided to actively help improve  North Korea's relations with the United States and Japan if the  third round of North Korea-U.S. high-level talks are held, it  was learned yesterday.    The government thinks that the northern policy implemented  by  the Sixth Republic must have deepened North Korea's isolation,  thereby leading to the acceleration of its nuclear development,  and that, therefore, practical assistance to North Korea to open  itself up will be necessary for the development of inter-Korean  relations, said a relevant government official on 31 December.    Relevant government officials understand that North Korea  and  the United States almost agreed to hold the third round of  high-level talks through a series of working contacts in New  York and that, accordingly, the inter-Korean dialogue and North  Korea-U.S. dialogue to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue  will make rapid progress this year.</p>

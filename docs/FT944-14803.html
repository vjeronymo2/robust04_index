			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Radical plan for small-business accounting Small companies could be freed from statutory accounting codes if a radical report from the accountancy profession's working party on standards is accepted. The working party, set up under the auspices of the profession's six professional bodies and commissioned by the Accounting Standards Board, has suggested exemptions for the vast majority of companies. The report, expected to be published by the end of the month, will go out for wide public review before a final set of conclusions is presented to the board - the body which sets financial reporting standards. While thousands of small companies will welcome the cut in what they see as red tape, the response from other interested parties, such as bankers and the Inland Revenue, may not be as supportive. Mr Ken Wild, chairman of the working party on generally accepted accounting principles, confirmed yesterday that the final report will seek radical exemptions - but insisted it was a 'starting position'. The report will urge the board to exempt companies with an annual turnover of less than Pounds 2.8m from all but four of the existing statements of standard accounting practice. These would be SSAPs 4, 9, 13 and 17. The exemptions cover accounting for government grants, stores and work in progress, research and development, and post-balance sheet events. Small companies would also be freed, under the proposals, from all the board's seven published financial reporting standards and all but one of the abstracts produced by the task force on urgent issues. The one exception covers the ability to 'override' certain accounting rules in order to present a true and fair view. Significantly, the group is also seeking to exempt small companies from all future board standards unless a special case can be made for their inclusion. While the board will welcome the results of the public consultation it is likely to have reservations about sweeping away too many controls on company accounts - particularly in areas such as pensions. Mr Wild said: 'We believe that the ASB will probably accept the report provided it has got public support.' Mr Wild, who is technical partner at Touche Ross, said in some cases following the rules in a small company actually led to misleading accounts. Receiverships for the three months from July to September rose by 5.8 per cent on the previous three months, according to figures from accountants KPMG Peat Marwick. In the third quarter 508 corporate failures were recorded, compared with 480 in the second quarter. In spite of the increase the total number of receiverships for the first nine months of 1994 is down on the same period in 1993 - 1,579 compared to 2,332.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Berenice Maranhao] </F>   [Text] As far back as 2,500 years ago, political  philosophers like Plato, Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas, Thomas  Hobbes, John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Thomas Jefferson,  James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Karl  Marx devoted their thoughts to issues on ethics, sovereignty,  social engagement, human rights, governmental corruption, the  balance between liberty and order, and others. Only Niccolo  Machiavelli was concerned about the art of government as it is  and not as it should be. He specifically called attention to an  overpowering phenomenon, the offspring of power, which he  labeled the "foolishness of the leader," that is, the  self-destructive mechanism that makes a leader fail, beginning  at a specific critical point in time, because his commitment to  power weakens him at a rate directly proportional to his  performance.    General Humberto Ortega has always been a remarkable  Nicaraguan, both politically and militarily, and his presence  became more meaningful even during the revolutionary transition.  Beginning with the "Camilo Ortega of the Gringos [as  published]," however, he began walking a path toward his own  foolishness, which has now culminated with his voluntary  appearance before the Military Prosecutor's Office, which he  commands. In addition, he voluntarily waived a very significant  part of his military authority "directly linked to military  jurisdiction."    The consequences of his foolishness were overwhelming and  imminent: He was arrested. Although it was a "precautionary"  arrest, he lacks the right, as is done with potential offenders,  to leave his house, city, and country. Is this the self-destruct  principle? We do not know for certain yet, but we are wondering.  <H5>  Helms' Geniegate </H5>   How did Gen. Ortega allow himself to get involved in this  case by behaving in an manner contrary to reason, contrary to  the nation's best interests, contrary to his irreproachable  behavior, and contrary to a clear analysis of the situation? He  said he did it in the name of ethics and morality, but in this  case, these issues should never have arisen. The general was  definitely aware that the "Genie Case," at least in terms of the  form it assumed after being mishandled, had nothing to do with  the sad incident that shortened the life of young Jean Paul  Genie. Gen. Ortega knows, as every prudent person in Nicaragua  knows, that this case is being manipulated from the United  States by those who, as a letter stated, "have attempted to  subject to their whims the dignity and pride of Nicaraguans for  more than a century. [no closing quotation marks as published]    Bringing Gen. Ortega to court must have made the Jesse  Helmses of the world lose sleep. I am sure of this. A couple of  months ago, a prominent U.S. Embassy spokesman in Nicaragua told  me that North Americans would accept many things from the  Chamorro administration; they would not accept, however, that  Lenin Cerna stay in the country and that the Genie case go  unpunished, not because of the case in itself, but because it  was the most direct way to fatally hurt Gen. Ortega, just as  Watergate hurt Richard Nixon.    U.S. strategists must now be "surprised" by Ortega's  foolishness in facilitating the plot they devised to destroy  him. As of this moment, Gen. Ortega is indeed under house arrest  for a crime he did not commit. We do not know what will happen  tomorrow because the Nicaraguan Week of Wailing began after the  Judases of Camdessus, Alexander Watson, and Inter-American  Development Bank President Enrique Iglesias left. Iglesias  promised to lend $500 million to finance three years of  development in Nicaragua, and the black box of the ESAF  [Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility] is still pending.  <H5>  A Plan To Destroy </H5>   Judases! It is ridiculous that millions and millions of  dollars that belong to Nicaraguans, according to a resolution by  the International Court at The Hague, remain frozen in the  vaults of the U.S. Treasury to ensure that the vaults of our  Central Bank remain criminally empty, thereby leaving the  Chamorro government vulnerable to all sorts of blackmail.    Indeed, the Week of Wailing has begun. Anything can happen  because the enemies are awake, and they are sending no flowers.  Regardless of what happens, however, they can be sure about one  thing: All of Latin America is behind Gen. Ortega and his  foolishness. Regardless of the consequences of Gen. Ortega's  foolishness, Latin America is supporting him by firmly waving  the Bolivarian flag of independence, self-determination,  democracy, and development with social justice. Latin America is  committed to Gen. Ortega because of everything he was as well as  everything he was not.</p>

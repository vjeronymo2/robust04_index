			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Survey of European Business Locations (1): Europe-wide market lures - The corporate scramble to establish a base within the world's largest single trading block has been frenetic. Although the pace has been slowed by the erosion of economic confidence, eyes are now shifting further east as Europe's enormous potential takes on a new dimension EUROPE faces a long, tough struggle if its political ambitions are ever to bear fruit, but, with 10 weeks to go until the completion of the European Community's inter-nal market, there can be no such uncertainties over the potential of its combined, economic power. The creation of the world's largest single trading block, permitting the free movement of goods, people, services and capital, though it will not usher in an overnight revolution in business practices and patterns, will bring into sharp focus the immense commercial potential which Europe now presents to an international business community in search of a share of the action. Though fears of a protectionist Europe - conspiring to close its doors on outside competitors - have receded, the corporate scramble to establish a base within the community has been frenetic, slowed only by the international turndown in economic confidence. Global figures on direct foreign investment already demonstrate that Europe is a prime target for a large slice of the funds which search the world for a home. Total inward investment into the EC countries alone during 1991 reached nearly Dollars 65bn. The UK, in spite of its national inferiority complex, continues to attract the lion's share of all EC inward investment. Last year, it accounted for one-third of the total, involving more than 300 new inward projects and either creating or safeguarding more than 50,000 jobs. American corporations continue to top the list of big spenders in Europe, with the Japanese in second place. Contrary to some expectations, many of the investment decisions do not involve high-tech installations but a range of basic manufacturing activities offering significant employment opportunities. The search is also on for the large parcels of land - 200 acres upwards - increasingly required by the largest, multinational organisations, as they recognise that the removal of national barriers within the EC often negates the need to duplicate plants across the territory. Consolidation at a single complex, or within two or three regional centres, is often the answer. Together with the European Free Trade Association (Efta) nations, the countries of the EC combine to provide a virtually barrier-free market of around 400m people in 19 countries. Their economies are more interlinked and inter-dependent than ever before, and yet they contain within them wide disparities embracing everything from language to labour laws. To the immediate east, the political and economic revolution under way adds another, longer-term dimension to European development. Many companies in the free market economies will be eyeing up eastern Europe as a possible production base, while others will see it as a new market in which to sell. Most attention has, until now, been focused on the markets of former East Germany, where the Treuhand-anstalt privatisation agency is planning to dispose of all saleable businesses by the end of 1993. Around 8,000 of the 12,000 companies on its books have now gone, securing nearly 2m jobs and bringing around Pounds 50bn of new investment. But other, former communist countries also hold out the promise of commercial success. Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary are playing host to increasing numbers of visitors with en eye to opening up operations. As author Daniel Burstein remarks in his book Euroquake, which paints Europe as an economic super-power capable of usurping the position of the US: 'The cocktail lounge in the Warsaw Marriott has come to resemble the famous intergalactic space bar from Star Wars'. Less fancifully, Braxton Associates, the international strategy consultants, sums up: 'In the next generation, eastern Europe will enter and become a significant part of the global economy. 'For those companies which have identified how that participation will impact on their global strategy, and responded to it, the pay-off could be enormous'. But while many companies are actively addressing, and acting upon, the challenge offered by a vast, diverse, rapidly changing European market, others have yet to recognise the implications, or to take appropriate action. The failure so far of hundreds of thousands of European companies to enact radical changes in the way they handle value added tax is only one example of the work left to be done. In Britain, as elsewhere, there is considerable ministerial concern that the political ructions over Europe's development have diverted attention from the practical problems of preparing for the single market. The danger is that many companies may quickly find themselves on the losing end of competition from those businesses which have developed a strategy to match the European vision. But there is also room for encouragement. Mr Paul Orchard Lisle, senior partner of Healey &amp; Baker, the real estate consultancy, says that businessmen are increasingly thinking as Europeans, able to take a broader view of comm-ercial opportunities and keen to improve their knowledge of local markets. According to Ernst &amp; Young Corporate Location, the location specialists, there is a growing tendency for companies to discard the notion of the nation state and instead to think Europe-wide for their markets and regionally for their facilities. But where are companies supposed to begin as they construct their European business strategies? 'You just cannot ask someone to fly to Amsterdam, Paris, London and Frankfurt, speak to everyone and come back with the right answers about where to set up. The decisions have become far too complex and critical for that,' says Dr Wilfried Vossen of Plant Location Internat-ional, the Price Waterhouse business location consultancy. Most location experts, and there are now plenty of them prepared to sell the benefit of their experience to companies on the move, agree that there is no such place as the perfect location. Most investors have to select a compromise which comes closest to meeting their requirements. Each project will have clear technical requirements which will have a direct bearing on the choice of location, but financing will play an equally critical role, both in terms of operating costs and the one-off costs of acquiring land, buildings and equipment. Operating conditions are also critical. Low wages and a plentiful supply of labour may appear attractive, until the employer realises skills levels are poor. Sweden may have high rates of absenteeism but it boasts one of the lowest corporate tax burdens; telecommunications costs for multinational companies are lower in the UK, but the country, in spite of enormous improvements, still has a higher rate of labour disputes than several other EC states. When all the technical, financial and operational factors have been assessed, potential investors can then consider the range of financial incentives made available in most countries. They include cash grants, interest-free loans, fast depreciation schemes, tax credits and training grants - all of which will require the recipient to put something back into the community, whether it is jobs, new export business or more research and development activity. Dr Vossen at PLI says that incentives can play a crucial role in determining a project's profitability. PLI has researched the impact of incentives on investment decisions and concluded that net cash investment for the same project less than 100km apart can vary by nearly 30 per cent because of land costs and different incentive package combinations. 'The impression is given that investment incentives are being reduced all over Europe. The reverse is the truth, although the schemes on offer are increasingly diverse. 'Incentives can be decisive in the final stages of the decision-making process. But if companies are led into choosing a location primarily because of what they can get in hand-outs, it is they who will inevitably pay the price.'</p>

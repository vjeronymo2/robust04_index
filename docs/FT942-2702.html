			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / FT Guide to World Cup Football (6): Group A - Colombia Colombia's loss to Cameroon in Naples in the second round in 1990 was one of the most frustrating performances of that World Cup. It was as if the side was more intent on asserting its bizarre identity than winning. Rene Higuita, the goalkeeper, gave away a goal by trying to dribble around Roger Milla outside his penalty area. In attack Carlos Valderrama orchestrated a mesmerising web of interpassing that never seemed to take the ball near the Cameroonian goal. - This time Higuita, just out of jail, is absent. But Valderrama is back to act as ringmaster to a team that seems to have found a greater cutting edge. Alongside Valderrama is Fredy Rincon, who scored the late equaliser against Germany in 1990 that earned Colombia a second-round place. In attack Colombia has Faustino Asprilla (Parma), the most exhilarating but also the most frustrating star of the star-studded Italian league. Adolfo Valencia (Bayern Munich), an old-fashioned bull of a centre forward, is one of several possible striking partners for Asprilla. Rincon has said of Colombia: we like to put on a show. Winning is a bonus.' But his team showed they could do both when they walloped Argentina - 5-0 in Buenos Aires last September to secure a place in the US. With any luck they will continue to try to do both in the US. A few confidence-building wins could unleash their exciting potential and the draw has been helpful. Colombia should win this group. That would give them a second-round match against a third-place team. They are capable of beating anyone, but in Italy they beat themselves.</p>

			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> LEGALITY IN DOUBT;  </P> <P> DAVIS UNVEILS PLAN TO ALLOW SEARCHES OF AUTOS FOR GUNS  </P> <P> State Sen. Ed Davis, a former Los Angeles police chief, Wednesday unveiled a  bill he said would give law enforcement agencies a valuable tool to fight gang  violence by permitting them to conduct searches of automobiles for guns even  without reason to believe that a crime has been committed.  </P> <P> The bill, which civil libertarians immediately challenged as unconstitutional,  would phase in a program that would permit random searches of vehicles in  specified high-crime areas after an emergency was declared by local elected  officials.  </P> <P> It also would allow superficial visual inspections for weapons at checkpoints  much like those now used to detect drunken drivers, even when an emergency has  not been declared.  </P> <P> "We must be able to protect ourselves one way or another from murder," Davis  (R-Valencia) said in an interview after a press conference where he announced  the measure.  </P> <P> He identified South-Central Los Angeles, where gang violence and drive-by  shootings are common, as one area where the proposed law might be invoked.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Legal Precedent  </P> <P> Davis acknowledged that there is no legal precedent in this country for random  searches of automobiles.  </P> <P> But, he said, "we're going to make legal precedent. . . . This, I think, has a  chance of being declared constitutional. Who in the world would oppose this  except my friends in the ACLU?"  </P> <P> Joan Howarth, associate director of the American Civil Liberties Union of  Southern California, said the Davis bill, if enacted, would be a clear  violation of citizens' Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable  searches.  </P> <P> "There is not a court in the land that would uphold that proposal," she said.  </P> <P> Howarth said Davis' plan "would suspend the Constitution. . . . The only reason  anyone would be proposing this is the deep frustration so many of us have about  crime that seems to be out of control."  </P> <P> Davis said he thought his bill could survive the ACLU's inevitable challenge  because city councils and county supervisors, after reasoned debate, would  authorize the random searches, rather than police agencies. That approval  process would show that the decision to search was reached after sufficient  deliberation, Davis said.  </P> <P> "All searches are not prohibited, only unreasonable searches," he said.  </P> <P> Even after an emergency was declared, only drivers who had renewed their  licenses after January, 1990, would have to submit to searches since they would  have agreed to allow the inspections as a condition of license renewal, Davis  said.  </P> <P> Within four years, all drivers licensed by California would have signed forms  authorizing a weapons search in emergency situations, the senator said. Such a  condition can be placed on a driver's license because driving is a privilege,  not a right, Davis said.  </P> <P> "This is a reasonable restraint on that privilege," he said.  </P> <P> Howarth, however, said drivers cannot be forced to sign away a right to privacy  in exchange for a license.  </P> <P> "People in California, particularly Southern California, need to drive to go to  school and to work and to conduct their lives," she said. "The right of travel  has been recognized in this state and other states" by the courts.  </P> <P> Davis' bill should also be challenged, she said, because it allows cars to be  stopped at checkpoints and examined for weapons, though not thoroughly searched  unless evidence of weapons is detected.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Legality Upheld  </P> <P> The legality of sobriety checkpoints, after which Davis' provision is modeled,  was upheld 4 to 3 by the state Supreme Court in 1987 after the majority  concluded that a minimal intrusion into a driver's privacy was justified for  the public good.  </P> <P> Davis' bill, in allowing an examination that is likely to take longer than a  sobriety check, would seem more intrusive and the court would be unlikely to  approve it, Howarth said.  </P> <P> Davis said the legal principals on which checkpoint inspections for weapons  would be based have been upheld in the state and federal supreme courts.  </P> <P> While Davis said he knew of no previous effort to rewrite the law on weapons  searches, Berkeley City Atty. Manuela Albuquerque said that she studied the use  of legal principals applied to sobriety checkpoints in 1987 and was convinced  that they could not be used effectively on the streets.  </P> <P> She said she concluded that the precedents on sobriety searches would not apply  to any kind of weapons stop.  </P> <P> Albuquerque added: "Our police said there would be no way to detect weapons"  based upon the superficial inspections courts allow at sobriety checkpoints.  </P> <P> "My conclusion was that the constitutional limitations were such that we  couldn't get any practical benefit unless we transgressed them."  </P></p>

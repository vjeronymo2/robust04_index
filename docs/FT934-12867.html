			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Executive pay rises edge up THE RATE of average pay rises for executives is beginning to edge up again after falling consistently since 1991, the latest index produced for the Financial Times by the Noble Lowndes group of management consultants and actuaries shows. The October survey shows that the average increase over the past 12 months was 5.7 per cent, compared with 5.3 per cent in the 12 months to July. Before that, the annual rate had declined every quarter from the 13.8 per cent recorded in 1990. But the upturn in the average rate, which covers all ranks of executives, conceals variations for different levels of management, with the advantage going mainly to those at board level. For chief executives, the rate has increased from 5.4 per cent to 6.3 per cent in companies with sales turnovers of up to Pounds 100m, and from 5.7 per cent to 6 per cent in companies with turnovers from Pounds 101m to Pounds 600m. In bigger concerns, the chiefs' rate has gone on falling from 5.9 per cent to 5.7 per cent. The rate for other directors has risen in both the bigger sizes of company - from 5.5 per cent to 5.9 per cent in the Pounds 101m-Pounds 600m band and from 5.7 per cent to 6.4 per cent in the Pounds 600m-plus category - while falling from 5.4 per cent to 5.0 per cent in the smallest group. Among executives below board level the only upturn has been for senior managers in companies with turnovers under Pounds 100m, with an increase from 5.1 per cent to 5.4 per cent. The rates of rise for senior and middle managers in all the other categories have continued to slow by three or four percentage points. The index, which includes benefits such as cars and pensions as well as salaries and bonuses, also shows that companies are trimming the cost of executives' cars at all levels of management. The average value of company cars stood at Pounds 8,836 in July, representing 10.6 per cent of the average total pay of Pounds 83,245. This month the car value is Pounds 8,538 or 10.1 per cent of the increased total of Pounds 84,457.

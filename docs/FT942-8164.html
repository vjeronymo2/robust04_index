			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: BA set to soar again - The week ahead British Airways' tradition of near break-even fourth-quarter results has seen analysts forecasting that full-year pre-tax profits will be about Pounds 300m, against Pounds 185m, when they are revealed on Monday. But the tone of the statement could be more important than the headline profit. The stock has been weak since lower-than-expected growth in traffic figures for April, and there are concerns about BA's troubled associate, USAir. The dividend is expected to be in the region of 11p. Thorn EMI, the music, rentals and electronics group, reports full-year results on Tuesday, with pre-tax profits expected to be between Pounds 330m and Pounds 340m, compared with Pounds 286.3m last time - although the 1992-3 figure is expected to be adjusted to take account of FRS 4. Pressure on margins has caused analysts to lower slightly their profit forecasts for BET, the business services group which reports annual results on Tuesday. They now expect pre-tax profits of Pounds 90m, compared with the previous loss of Pounds 9.8m. John Clark, the chief executive, has completed his three-year programme of restructuring and disposals after the group overstretched itself during the 1980s. Having eliminated Pounds 1bn of debt in the process, the City will want to know where Clark thinks future growth lies. Marks and Spencer is expected on Tuesday to extend its lead as the UK's most profitable retailer, with an increase of more than 17 per cent in full-year pre-tax figures from Pounds 736.5m to Pounds 865m. The tough conditions in the grocery market and new depreciation policies are likely to be reflected on Wednesday in a fall in full-year pre-tax profits at Argyll, the UK's third-largest grocery retailer. The consensus forecast among analysts is about Pounds 365m - down from Pounds 417m - after a new Pounds 40m depreciation charge following the group's decision to start writing down its superstores. The extent of the recovery in commercial property values will be underlined on Wednesday when Land Securities, the UK's largest quoted property company, reports its final results. After three years of steeply falling net asset values, the company's nav for the year to March is expected to rise from Pounds 5.04 a share to a figure in the range of Pounds 6.30-Pounds 6.60. Pre-tax profits are likely to remain static at around Pounds 233m. Serious watchers of Carlton Communications, the broadcasting and television services group, are plumping for pre-tax results between Pounds 65m and Pounds 70m in the half-year, compared with Pounds 55m last time. Analysts are forecasting pre-tax profits for UK telecommunications group Cable &amp; Wireless in the region of Pounds 1.05bn, a 27 per cent increase on last year (Pounds 824m). That would give earnings per share of 22.6p, a 16 per cent increase on last year (19.4p). However, better-than-expected results announced last Thursday at Hongkong Telecom, C&amp;W's largest business, might make that view somewhat pessimistic. It reported turnover 12 per cent up at HKDollars 24.3bn. When Trafalgar House announces interim results on Thursday, analysts will be expecting a marginal decline in its operating performance but no more provisions. There is a range of pre-tax profit forecasts from Pounds 25m to Pounds 38m, comparing favourably with last year's Pounds 97.6m loss.</p>

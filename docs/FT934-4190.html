			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / How To Spend It: Flowers for the festive season - Fabric and foliage are fashionable accessories when it comes to decoration If you had asked either of my grannies they would have been quite astonished at the notion that flowers could be in and out of favour. The very idea that the chrysanthemum, the iris or the carnation (let alone, shudder, shudder, the poor old spray carnation) would be given such a heave-ho by the chicken-wire and 'oasis' set would have been enough to confirm them in their vision of a world gone mad. But I am sure that those of you who are even now planning the decorations for the festive season at chateau mon repos would like to know that the marigold (once a real no-no) is back in favour. How do I know? Well, Caroline Dickenson ('one of London's most innovative florists') tells me so and she ought to know. Caroline has recently turned the ballroom and other banqueting areas at the Dorchester Hotel into a veritable scene from Arabian Nights and, using 12ft-tall candelabras decked with cream roses (not one to emulate chez vous  -a trifle ambitious perhaps for the domestic setting) transformed a London site into a set from the film Orlando. In addition, she regularly does the flowers for chic eateries such as Le Gavroche and Mosimann's as well as Christian Lacroix, Cartier and Yves St Laurent. This Christmas, says Caroline, it is artificial decorations that are the no-no: 'The trend is towards mixing berries and natural evergreen foliages such as trailing ivy, blue spruce and larch twigs with seasonal flowers combined with fruits, nuts and vegetables. 'If you are aiming for a traditional look, use strong colours such as rich dark reds, bright oranges and purples with various shades of dark green. 'Fabric is very much in evidence, too - ranging from bows made from silk organza to lengths of crushed velvet swathed through and round decorations. To add some glitz use gilded fruits such as pomegranates, apples and oranges and nuts. Adding spices and herbs such as cinnamon sticks, anise and bay to an arrangement will fill the room with a subtle yet exotic scent.' Indeed, great florists obviously think alike - at this week's grand Royal Opera House dinner at the Whitehall Palace, one of London's most sought-after creators of magical effects, Paul Dyson, had used a very similar decorative approach. He had featured lots of brilliant strong colours in the flowers - reds, oranges, ambers - and the staircase was richly swathed with flowers, foliage and generous swags of ruby red velvet. 'Candles,' says Caroline, 'shed a soft glimmering light but if you are trying to create a rich, warm effect use dark red, green and purple coloured candles instead of white. 'To create a strong effect group decorations together rather than scattering them around separately. There should be continuity in the theme. For instance, if you are using blue pine you can use it in all sorts of different ways - from decorating a fireplace and a staircase to forming the base for a wall hanging or door wreath.' The scheme photographed here at Mosimann features many of her precepts - deep rich colours, strong groupings, fabric and, above, all a sense of generosity. Decorations should never be mean and sparsely scattered. Fireplaces are often the focal point of a room and a decorated mantelpiece can set the warm and welcoming scene. Swagging made from blue spruce can be draped along the mantelpiece and down each side of the fireplace. Bunches of red and orange full-blown roses and bunches of red anemones (for which 10 stems per bunch seems the approved number) can be tied on tightly with string or floristry wire. These will obviously only last for a few days so be prepared to change them and to put them in place as close to the last minute as you can bear. Bunches of evergreen foliages, berries and larch twigs with lichen can be attached with floristry wire along the swagging to soften the look. A length of crushed velvet could also be swagged along the mantelpiece. Add bundles of cinnamon sticks, apples and tangerines - again attach with floristry wire. When it comes to the table she suggests taking several different-sized terracotta pots. Line them with black bin liners to prevent water leaking. Then fill them with evergreen foliage, berries, anemones and roses echoing the colours used for decorating the mantelpiece. A large terracotta pot in the centre and smaller ones around the table works well. (They might also make good presents to give guests to take home.) The pots can be linked with swathes of crushed velvet (velvet, you will have gathered, is the fabric of the year) along the centre of the table or with trails of ivy leaves and foliage such as skimmia or variegated holly. Bunches of berries, foliage and flowers can also be attached to candelabras with floristry wire. Many of these precepts apply to decorating the tree - above all, do not skimp, do not be mean. You should allow at least 10 lights for every foot of tree and try to make sure the wire and tape are the same colour as the tree. Decorations can be made from bows of velvet ribbon or silk organza, with fir cones, bunches of lavender, tiny terracotta pots stuffed with paper and topped with glued-in nuts and the whole effect can be softened with added bunches of larch covered in lichen. If you can handle all that little lot yourself you are a better person than I am - or better organised or less busy. The ill-organised, the lazy or the genuinely over-worked can call in Caroline Dickenson herself: she can either supply the wherewithall (the blue spruce swagging, the door wreathes, the flowers, the floristry and chicken wire, the oasis and the gilded pomegranates, dried orange slices, peppers and chillies) which you can deploy skilfully around the house. Or she will come and do it all for you. Her prices range from Pounds 10 for a simple arrangement to Pounds 5,000 for a grand hall but there is a lot more in between. Caroline Dickenson is at 5, William Street, Knightsbridge, London SW1X 9HL. Tel: 071-245-9599.</p>

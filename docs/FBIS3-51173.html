			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 13 Jan (NA) -- The national cabinet  today decided to implement a strong plan to generate jobs and  provide social aid in the eight northern Argentine provinces  after President Carlos Menem's decision to place the security  services on alert in face of the possible reappearance of urban  guerrillas.    The cabinet decision, which appears to be directly linked to  the president's concerns, was announced by Labor Minister  Armando Caro Figueroa, who said that, among other measures, it  has been decided to create eight management offices to create  jobs and monitor Social Plan funds.    The labor minister did not want to discuss the measures  adopted by Menem and his security cabinet regarding possible  guerrilla actions in the provinces experiencing a social crisis  by saying: "It is not good to make predictions."    He also downplayed the fact that the Armed Forces commanders  were summoned by the president by saying that such an issue  "must not be considered exceptional because it exists in all the  democratic countries I know."    Caro Figueroa said the government "is not indifferent" to  the  decision of the General Labor Confederation (CGT) to hold a  general strike on a yet undetermined date, "although we will  continue prioritizing a dialogue" in an attempt to make union  leaders change their mind.    Media Secretary Raul Burzaco said the other subjects  discussed during the security cabinet meeting were the  implementation of the Social Plan by the health and social  action minister, a briefing by Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella  about the possibility of granting Argentine citizenship to the  children of Argentines residing abroad, and other reports read  by [National Tourism Agency Director] Francisco Mayorga and  [Natural Resources and Environment Secretary] Maria Julia  Alsogaray.    Caro Figueroa said he first informed the cabinet members of  the state of negotiations with the CGT and the business  organizations.    Among other points already known by the public, the labor  minister informed the cabinet about the labor unions' demands to  make the government responsible for the labor unions' previous  debts in keeping with the a law that has not been applied yet.  "We will comply with this legal obligation," Caro Figueroa said.    The security cabinet created on 12 January by Menem will  follow up the social situation in the provinces, on the lookout  for eventual social revolts, Caro Figueroa said. He added: "It  is necessary to adopt different measures because the labor  situation is not the same in all the provinces."    That is why he announced the decision, which was approved by  the cabinet, to create eight management offices to promote  employment and follow up the distribution of social aid funds in  each of the country's northern provinces.    These management offices "must not only guarantee the  efficiency of the social expenses but also support the  decentralization and reconversion process" implemented by the  central government.    He said the reconversion policy in the provinces undergoing  a  serious social crisis "must be carried out with the least social  cost possible," adding that "it is possible to implement these  changes in an untraumatic manner."    When discussing the official decision to place the  intelligence services on alert, Caro Figueroa said: "They are  measures to guarantee internal security, and they must not be  considered exceptional issues because they exist in all the  democratic countries I know."    He added that it is not an isolated fact within the  government "since all the policies, the economic policy and the  social policy, go together hand in hand."    He denied that the concern over the alleged reappearance of  a  guerrilla group "came up just by chance," as well as the concern  over the need to implement social policies in the troubled  provinces, given that "the government has been concerned about  the situation in the northern provinces for more than a year."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ba'lbakk, Lebanon, June 8 (AFP)--Syrian troops and  Hizballah guerrillas fired anti-aircraft guns at Israeli  warplanes but missed as the jets flew over positions of the  Iranian-backed Hizballah in eastern Lebanon, police said.    Seven fighter bombers flew mock raids over the al-Biqa'  valley villages of al-Nabi Shit and Janta, where Hizballah has  training camps, police said. Janta is located eight kilometers  (around five miles) from the border with Syria.    Israeli warplanes carried out reconnaissance flights over  the  al-Biqa' overnight Monday, less than a week after killing 32  guerrillas in a devastating raid on a Hizballah training camp in  the region.    Israel mounted the raid less than two weeks after its  commandos snatched Moslem fundamentalist guerrilla chief  al-Mustafa Dirani from his home in the al-Biqa' valley to obtain  information on missing Israeli airman Ron Arad.    After the air strike, guerrillas fired katyusha rockets on  northern Israeli prompting the Jewish state to mass troops on  its border with Lebanon and to threaten a land operation unless  the rocketing stopped.    Lebanon protested to the United Nations, branding the  abduction and the raid acts of piracy that violated its  sovereignty and called for an emergency meeting of the Security  Council.    But US opposition defeated a draft council resolution on  Monday condemning the Israeli raid.    Tension has gripped south Lebanon and dozens of families  fled  north fearing an Israeli operation as Beirut, Damascus and  Tehran discussed ways of preventing any action which could give  Israel pretext to retaliate.    Hizballah, which spearheads anti-Israeli operations in south  Lebanon, has vowed to avenge the blood of its "martyrs" and said  the fight with Israel was open on all fronts.    On Tuesday guerrillas fired 14 katyusha rockets into  Israel's  self-declared "security zone" in south Lebanon, causing neither  casualties nor damage. Ten rockets fell on the outskirts of  Marj 'Uyun, headquarters of the Israeli army and its proxy South  Lebanon Army, in south Lebanon. Hizballah did not claim  responsibility for the rocketing but said its guerrillas had  fired around 30 mortar shells at an SLA [South Lebanon Army]  outpost on the edge of the zone.</p>

			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE BARS ANY MORE CONCERTS BY THE GRATEFUL DEAD  </P> <P> Bowing to complaints about concert-goers' traffic, loitering and public  urination, Cal State Dominguez Hills has decided never to invite the Grateful  Dead rock band back to its campus.  </P> <P> The band, which has a devoted following harking back to its roots in the  counterculture of the 1960s, drew crowds of 30,000 to concerts on campus  Saturday and Sunday.  </P> <P> "The concert on the campus was peaceful, . . . but it is important to us that  we be a good neighbor to the Carson community," said university spokesman  Richard Turner.  </P> <P> "In the interest of good relations . . . we have decided not to invite the  Grateful Dead back to our campus," he said.  </P> <P> The band was asked not to return to the Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre in Orange  County after three concerts there in April, 1989, resulted in 91 arrests,  including some stemming from clashes with security forces. However, the band  expects to return to the Forum in Inglewood this year despite the death of an  LSD-intoxicated fan in police custody during a three-day stand there last  December.  </P> <P> Turner said university president Robert C. Detweiler decided late Sunday  afternoon against inviting the band back after receiving a briefing from the  captain of the Carson sheriff's station about community complaints.  </P> <P> "That's probably best," Carson Mayor Vera Robles DeWitt said, "because our  neighborhoods are up in arms about it."  </P> <P> DeWitt said she had received calls about fans "parking all over the place,  40-minute (delays) to get from the freeway to residents' homes, urinating in  public."  </P> <P> Turner said other large-scale events, including circus performances, reggae and  gospel music festivals, and bicycle races had been staged on campus at the  Velodrome without incident.  </P> <P> But the Grateful Dead concert was the largest.  </P> <P> "We never had a concert of this size on the campus," Turner said. "We have  never had 30,000 people two days in a row."  </P> <P> Law-enforcement officials praised the behavior of the crowd at the concert.  About 20 undercover officers made more than 50 drug-related arrests, many for  possession of hallucinogens like LSD, but none for more serious crimes.  </P> <P> A young woman allegedly took LSD outside the concert Saturday night, ran a red  light in Manhattan Beach and broadsided another car, killing a pregnant woman  and her fetus. Heather Tolles, 19, of South Pasadena was charged Tuesday with  two counts of second-degree murder in the incident.  </P> <P> University officials said their decision to ban future Grateful Dead concerts  was not related to the accident.  </P> <P> In an attempt to avoid the rowdiness that has plagued a number of Dead concerts  across the nation, university officials and Bill Graham Productions Inc., the  concert promoter, had taken special precautions, hiring 350 crowd control  monitors and beefing up campus security with officers from other Cal State  campuses and from the Sheriff's Department.  </P> <P> Turner said the promoter sent Grateful Dead fans detailed information, along  with their tickets, on the whereabouts of private campgrounds, motels and  hotels near the campus. Parking on campus was included in the ticket price.  </P> <P> "We made sure people didn't camp out in Carson. We made every attempt," Turner  said. "All the motels and hotels were full to capacity. We wanted to make sure  there would be no disruption."  </P> <P> The promoter put 150 portable toilets on the concert grounds and in parking  lots.  </P> <P> The Sheriff's Department, which provides police services for Carson under  contract with the city, set up street barricades to keep concert traffic from  overflowing into residential neighborhoods surrounding the campus.  </P> <P> But the barricades became a bone of contention.  </P> <P> "Neighbors felt like they were prisoners," said Councilwoman Sylvia Muise, who  lives close to the university.  </P> <P> "People couldn't go to back-yard barbecues because of roads blocked off. Food  orders couldn't be delivered."  </P> <P> Muise added that her neighbors told her of instances of drunkenness, nudity,  urination, defecation and the display of Confederate flags in predominantly  black neighborhoods.  </P> <P> She said she received complaints from storekeepers who decided not to open for  business after finding people sleeping in front of the stores. "Many of the  people who roamed the streets are not people one would want to hold up as a  role model for young people," Muise said.  </P> <P> Turner said the university, which has an operating budget of $50 million,  netted less than $100,000 from the concert.  </P> <P> The next major event on campus is a bicycle race involving the U.S. National  Bicycling Team, which is scheduled for Friday night at the Velodrome.  </P></p>

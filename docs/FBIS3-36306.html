As Grachev has reported in an interview with Interfax, the  facilities are to be located at Vaziani (30 kilometers south of  Tbilisi), at Akhalkalaki (southern Georgia), and at Batumi (the  Ajar Autonomous Republic).    As he explained, the bases will get under construction in  1995 after the term of Russian troops interim presence expires,  and their status will differ much from that of the Russian  forces in Georgia now. Russia will foot the entire troops  maintenance bill and will partly compensate for its military  presence in Georgia.    Grachev emphasized that the primary goal of the bases would  be to defend the CIS North Caucasian flank.    According to experts, there are about 8000 Russian  servicemen  in Georgia. With the formation of three bases in Georgia plus  two facilities in Armenia and Azerbaijan, the Russian army in  Transcaucasia will total 23,000 men.</p>

			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Slovak steelmakers find success has a price - A huge rise in exports to the EC is subject of 'dumping' talks SENIOR officials from the Slovak steel company Vychodoslovenske Zelezarny (VSZ) meet leaders of Eurofer, the European steel producers' association, this week to fend off threats of anti-dumping penalties. This follows a cry of alarm from French, Italian and other steel producers over what Eurofer claims is a 126 per cent rise in Czechoslovak steel exports to western Europe over the first four months of this year. According to Czechoslovak trade figures steel exports to the EC amounted to 346,000 tonnes over the first quarter of 1992, as the three main steel producers sought to reverse two years of sharply reduced output. Last year raw steel production fell to 12.13m tonnes from 14.9m tonnes in 1990 and output of rolled products dropped 15.7 per cent to 9.27m tonnes from 11m tonnes in 1990. Much of the increase in rolled steel exports to the EC, from a low base, has come from this huge integrated steel plant in the far east of Slovakia, less than 50km from what is now the border with an independent Ukraine. Mr Zoltan Berghauer, chairman of the 100-per-cent state-owned joint stock company (which is now being privatised through the Czechoslovak mass privatisation voucher programme) says that higher exports are allowed under the association agreements signed between the EC and the central European states of Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland last year. But he is anxious to reach a compromise with Eurofer. 'I understand their fears of being flooded and I think we'll make an agreement,' he says of the talks on Thursday with Mr Francis Mer, chairman of Usinor Sacilor, the French steel company, who will head the Eurofer delegation. After two years of profound managerial and other changes at VSZ, however, he is also sure that the Slovak company's prices genuinely reflect lower costs and recent productivity gains. 'We have two main cost advantages,' says Mr Mer. First, they import iron pellets cheaply from Krivoi Rog in the Ukraine via a 1,100km-long, Russian-gauge railway while coal comes 350km by rail from Ostrava in northern Moravia. Neither has to be expensively trans-shipped, and both raw materials are mechanically unloaded on arrival. Second, wage costs are only 5-6 per cent of total costs, compared with between 20-28 per cent in western Europe. Employment in steel making has fallen from 19,800 to 11,000 men over the last two years while a managerial revolution has transformed the old pyramid-shaped command structure. Instead of 1,200 managers and 7-8 levels of management in 1989, the company now has a 70-man top management complement, he added. The company is now organised like a western holding with only 3-4 levels of management, over 50 subsidiaries centres and a lot of sub-contracting to newly privatised companies. Last year the company made a profit of 4.5bn koruna (Pounds 85m) on turnover of 50bn koruna 'according to accounts audited by Ernst and Young', adds Mr Berghauer, who was chief metallurgist of the plant throughout the 1980s and became chairman in 1990. 'Our quality levels are up to western standards - and so are our manning levels,' said Mr Stefan Link, adviser to the chairman, during a tour of the highly-automated plant. Costs will be further reduced next year when continuous casting fully replaces the traditional rolling mills which still make 50 per cent of the 3.2m tonnes of rolled steel produced annually. Between 60 and 65 per cent of output is exported. The collapse of the former Soviet market, and sharply reduced steel demand from Slovakia's own heavy armaments industry, forced the company to organise its own sales and marketing organisation and search for new markets in the west. The company already has a joint venture with Austria's Voest-Alpine and a metallurgical ceramics joint venture with Intocast of Germany. It is now discussing new joint ventures with Hoogovens of Holland to modernise tin sheet production and another with Ilva of Italy to produce special 'dynamo steel'. A subsidiary has formed a joint venture with Wimpey of the UK to modernise Kosice airport. At a time when unemployment is rising sharply in many Slovak companies, VSZ has pushed through a diversification programme which has created several thousand new jobs and raised total group employment to 32,000, including many of the 8,800 shed from steel making. Over 15,000 are employed in a wide array of mechanical engineering companies, many of which started life as suppliers to the steel making complex. They produce a wide range of products from artillery ammunition to bridge cranes, including boilers, air conditioning plant, domestic radiators, fuel pumps, castings of all kinds and cutlery. Much of this production is exported. Sectors such as ceramic refractory materials, formerly produced mainly for use within VSZ itself, are being modernised and expanded for wider sale while vehicle component production is also being stepped up to satisfy the fast growing Czech and Slovak car industries. Volkswagen is investing heavily in Skoda and is assembling Passat models at BAZ in Bratislava. These ancillary operations consume over 170,000 tonnes of steel from the core steelmaking business. But exports to the west remain crucial to the prosperity of Slovakia's biggest steel and engineering complex.</p>

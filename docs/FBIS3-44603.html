			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Beijing Central Television Program One  Network in Mandarin at 1210 GMT on 23 December broadcasts the  eleventh of a twelve-part documentary entitled: "Mao Zedong."  The eleventh part, which lasts for 50 minutes, is entitled:  "The Family of a Leader," and focuses on Mao's influence on the  life of his family members.    After video shows an on-screen prologue read by an  unidentified narrator: "Mao Zedong told his cousin: You are a  peasant, and farming is a more stable occupation...." the  documentary begins with video shots of Mao's two former  residences in Zhongnanhai. Then, video cuts to show historical  footage of Mao's visits to his hometown in Shaoshan in the late  fifties, where he paid respects to his parents' tomb. According  to interviews with local people, Mao admitted that even though  he was a communist, materialist, and atheist, he should still  pay respects to his parents for they had brought him into the  world. As the video shows photographs of Mao's brothers,  sisters, and other relatives, the narrators recounts how they,  inspired by Mao's lofty ideal, joined the revolution and later  became martyrs.    While the narrator introduces Mao's other relatives, the  video shows shots of a museum in Changsha, Hunan dedicated to  Mao's first wife Yang Kaihui, where her diary, in which she  confesses love for Mao, is on display. While the video  continues to show historical footage and photographs of Mao's  family, the narrator recounts Yan Kaihui's martyrdom in 1930 and  the fate of her sons with Mao: Anying, who after spending 20  years in the Soviet Army was sent to Korea and was killed in the  war in the early fifties, and Anqing, who became mentally  disabled during his childhood after torture was inflicted upon  him by foreign police forces in Shanghai. According to an  interview with his daughter-in-law, Mao always educated his  children to never seek privilege and "to live and work like the  children of ordinary working people." After the narrator  briefly describes Mao's life with his second wife He Zizhen in  Yanan, the video shows an interview with Li Min, the only  surviving daughter of his marriage to He; and Li Na, Mao's other  daughter from his marriage to Jiang Qing. The daughters  reminisce about the spartan way they were brought up, but say  their father left them with an enormous spiritual legacy.    The narrator continues: Mao brought up his offsprings the  way  he trained cadres. He always advocated: "The preservation of  the style of being modest and prudent, and guarding against  arrogance and rashness," as well as the spirit of hard work and  plain living. To underscore Mao's frugal material life, the  narrator cites his former head nurse, a train attendant, and  bodyguards describing, with deep emotion, his thrift and simple  lifestyle. As the video shows shots of his book-filled former  residences in Zhongnanhai, worn-out clothes, and other articles  of daily use in his living quarters, the narrator notes: The  protracted struggles during the revolution made him accustomed  to living sparsely. After the PRC's founding, he continued to  lead a thrifty life because he wanted to set a good example for  other cadres. In spite of his austere life, he always gave  generously to friends and relatives in need, and explicitly  stated that the money came from remuneration for books and  articles he had written.    At 1300 GMT, the documentary concludes with video of an  interview with Mao's cousin Mao Zelian, one of the relatives he  refused to arrange a job for in the early years of the PRC. Mao  Zelian, who is 80 and still working in the fields, recalls that  Mao told him his problem should be solved by the local  government, and that since he was a peasant, farming would be a  stable occupation.</p>

			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Hodder Headline advances to Pounds 2.6m after reconstruction Hodder Headline, the publisher which has now virtually finished the reconstruction following the merger of Headline and Hodder &amp; Stoughton, yesterday announced pre-tax profits for the year to end December up 27 per cent to Pounds 2.6m after exceptionals. Exceptional costs and provisions including redundancy payments associated with the reorganisation totalled Pounds 6.5m, only slightly greater than expected. Before the exceptional items operating and pre-tax profits were more than doubled at Pounds 4.6m and Pounds 4.5m respectively. Earnings per share before exceptionals were up 4 per cent to 12.4p but after exceptionals there was a drop of 48 per cent to 6.2p. Sales more than doubled to Pounds 51.1m, boosted by the second half revenues of Hodder &amp; Stoughton following the merger. There is a recommended final up 12 per cent to 3.35p, making a total of 5p (4.5p). Mr Tim Hely Hutchinson, group chief executive said the benefits from the reorganisation were now beginning to flow and annual full-year savings of Pounds 4m net would become apparent from the middle of this year. 'This comprehensive overhaul, particularly of Hodder &amp; Stoughton will be largely completed by the end of May and is the main story behind the figures this year,' he said. The group is planning a number of new ventures this year including the launch of an audio division. A new subsidiary is also being set up to publish low priced reprints - hardbacks at about Pounds 5. Hodder has already had two number one best-sellers this year - Thomas Keneally's Schindler's List and Edwina Currie's A Parliamentary Affair. The Hodder Headline share price closed down 1p at 407p.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed Article: "While the Problems Are Becoming </F> Worse in the Country the Reforms Are Headed in the Wrong  Direction"]    [Text] We are completing publication of the program for  extricating us from the crisis, which is meeting a hostile  reception from the leadership and the press.    This work, which is still not being published, has given  rise  to such a storm of enmity that the last names of L. Abalkin, N.  Petrakov and S. Shatalin are beginning to frighten the average  citizen and they are being labelled in the spirit of the old  agitprop practice.    "Without ceremony they are calling us enemies of the  people,"  Stanislav Shatalin lamented bitterly.    If one reads the commentaries and listens to the television  oracles, one gets the impression that a regular campaign like  the Burbulis "RF-politics" is beginning: find the enemy,  stigmatize him and destroy him. The aim of this outbreak of  "political cholera" is to distract society from this serious,  thoughtful and competent analysis of the reasons for the failure  of the policies of "shock therapy" which we call monetarism, and  to split the government and the regions into "ours" and "not  ours," and the whole country into two camps who do not trust one  another. To defame these competent, sober and  democraticly-minded academicians and through them the  Chernomyrdin-Soskovets government while it is trying to correct  the course which failed.    In a word, they are ostracizing these three well-know  academicians and aiming at those sober reformers in the  government who reject the shock therapy against the people.  This is evident to anyone who is acquainted with the  handwriting of the masters of behind the scene deals.    That is how they broke up the team and perhaps God will  judge  them as a team. But we have decided to acquaint the broad  reading public with almost the complete text of this serious,  and in our view, promising work of the Economic Department of  the Russian Academy of Sciences and the International "Reforma"  Fund, having published its chapters in three issues of RT  [RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA]. Let the readers themselves evaluate the  views of the academicians, their analysis of the reforms, and  their suggestions as to how to correct the fateful situation,  led by monetarism to socio-economic absurdity, and in fact to a  dead end.    We have singled out and are publishing with insignificant  cuts this chapter from the comprehensive program "Socio-Economic  Transformation in Russia: the Current Situation and New  Approaches" (see page 3). We are doing this not only because  the essence of the publication is organically intertwined with  RT's policy of a newspaper of social protection, but also  because we are talking here about material which can be  understood by each person.    It is namely the social side of the reforms being carried  out  which the population of Russia has categorically rejected, and  which is the reason for the crushing defeat of the "Russia's  Choice" party at the recent parliamentary elections. In  civilized countries such a party, having lost the elections,  would either go away or else seriously correct its course. Our  monetarists, counting themselves among the civilized, not only  do not want to recognize the loss of the people's trust, but are  trying to pin on others their fault for the country's  impoverisment.    And it is namely this chapter of the program that is  convincing: the welfare of working people and their social  security has been thrown to the side of the road of the  "reforms" of the stubborn and hard-headed monetarists.</p>

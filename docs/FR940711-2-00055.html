			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA Regions will determine whether a State/Tribe has submitted an ``adequate'' program based on the interpretation outlined above. EPA plans to provide more specific criteria for this evaluation when it proposes the State/Tribal Implementation Rule. EPA expects States/Tribes to meet all of these requirements for all elements of a MSWLF program before it gives full approval to a MSWLF program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> B. State of Florida  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On July 20, 1993, Florida submitted an application for adequacy determination for their municipal solid waste landfill permit program. On March 2, 1994, EPA published a tentative determination of adequacy for all portions of Florida's program. Further background on the tentative determination of adequacy appears at 59 FR 9980&hyph;9983 (March 2, 1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Along with the tentative determination, EPA announced the availability of the application for public comment and a public hearing which was held by EPA_Region IV on April 25, 1994, in Tallahassee, Florida. The public comment period, which originally ended on April 25, 1994, was extended an additional seven (7) days because of public interest. Comments were accepted on the tentative determination through close of business on May 2, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> C. Public Comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA Region IV received written and oral comments during the public comment period and public hearing on the tentative determination of adequacy for Florida. In addition to comments supporting EPA's determination, several issues and concerns were raised, which are outlined and responded to below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Liner design_Comments received during the public comment period presented the following issues regarding Florida's liner designs for municipal solid waste landfills: (1) Florida fails to require adequate liner design criteria which complies with minimum federal requirements and that would reduce leaks and improve leak detection capabilities, (2) Florida's liner designs contemplate the allowance of a double geomembrane liner without a low permeable clay component, (3) many of the assumptions that Florida made in their required MuitiMed modelling efforts were not actually indicative of conditions in Florida or did not present actual ``worst-case'' conditions, as is required when states submit alternative liner designs for EPA review, and (4) Florida's liner design demonstration was based on a point of compliance nearly 500 feet from the landfill boundary (almost five (5) times the distance allowed by state law).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA was charged with reviewing state municipal solid waste landfill permitting programs to determine if they meet the standards presently set forth in the federal criteria for municipal solid waste landfills, which are found at parts 257 and 258 of Chapter 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR 257 and 258). Florida's regulations incorporate ten (10) liner designs to be used in landfills in the state. Nine (9) of the liner designs are single composite systems which incorporate_from top to bottom_a leachate collection system, a flexible synthetic membrane and a layer of compacted soil (the federal standard liner system is also a composite requiring the same components, in the same order). The tenth of Florida's designs is a double liner system, which incorporates_from top to bottom_a leachate collection system, a flexible synthetic membrane, a second leachate collection/detection system, a second flexible synthetic membrane and a layer of compacted soil. The state of Florida has presented information to satisfactorily demonstrate that each of the liner systems prescribed in their regulations will meet the federal performance standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA performed an extensive review of Florida's liner requirements and found them to be comparable to the federal criteria at 40 CFR part 258. In addition, EPA Region IV retained an independent contractor to evaluate Florida's liner systems and conferred with an EPA landfill liner expert. After thorough review of all submitted information, the contractor also found Florida's liner systems to be comparable to the federal criteria.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's expert was called upon in the matter of Florida's assumption of 1 cm2/acre defect density in the flexible membrane portion(s) of their liner system. According to the EPA expert, with appropriate quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) during installation of the flexible membranes, the referenced defect density is achievable and has been extensively documented. The federal criteria at 40 CFR part 258 contain no specific QA/QC provisions. It is assumed that QA/QC will be ensured prior to disposal of wastes in landfill units. As Florida's QA/QC requirements are quite extensive and as it is the state alternative liner designs and not QA/QC that is being evaluated for comparability, it is appropriate to assume that Florida will ensure that QA/QC requirements are met during installation of municipal solid waste landfill liner systems in their state.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding the distance that Florida used for the point of compliance in their modelling, states must demonstrate to EPA that proposed alternatives meet federal performance standards. The federal performance standard for liner designs is that maximum concentration limits (MCLs) for listed constituents not be exceeded in the uppermost aquifer at the point of compliance, which must be on the landfill owner/operator's property and within 150 meters (approximately 500 feet of the landfill unit boundary). Although Florida requires that MCLs not be exceeded at a maximum distance of 100 feet (which is more restrictive than the federal criteria), utilization of the 500 foot distance is appropriate for Florida's demonstration that their requirements meet the federal performance standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Authority for and implications of approving alternative liner designs in Florida_Comments were received during the public comment period questioning whether EPA is authorized to allow statewide alternative liner designs and stating that Region IV's decision on Florida's liner designs will have national implications based on the presumption that any alternative liner design that EPA approves for Florida must likewise be approved in other states, ``given Florida's extreme vulnerability to groundwater pollution.'' EPA Headquarters has addressed the issue of EPA's authority to approve statewide alternative liner designs for municipal solid waste landfills. After review of 40 CFR part 258, the preamble to part 258 and EPA Headquarters training materials on the implementation of part 258, EPA Headquarters prepared a memorandum which concluded that the flexibility afforded to an approved State/Tribe allows the application of an alternative liner design on a State/Tribal-wide basis so long as that design meets the performance standard in all locations throughout the State/Tribe.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding the presumption that alternatives approved for Florida will have to be approved for other states, the State/Tribal adequacy review process requires EPA to evaluate each state's municipal solid waste landfill permit program based on the specifics of individual state requirements. Proposed alternatives to any of the federal standards are only to be accepted if the state demonstrates that the alternative(s) would meet federal performance standards. States proposing alternative liner designs are required to present data from analysis via the MultiMed fate and transport model, which requires information that can only be expressed based on particular state conditions (eg., precipitation, hydrologic conditions, etc.). EPA's decision to approve or disapprove a state's alternative liner design weighs heavily on the results of this state-specific modelling. Therefore, approval of an alternative liner design in one state would not automatically make the same liner approvable in another state. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

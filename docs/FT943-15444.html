			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Out-of-town shopping centre policy faces test Government resistance to out-of-town shopping centres is to be tested following a Court of Appeal decision to block a Pounds 200m development next to the Manchester Ship Canal. Recent planning guidance issued to local authorities by Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, shows the government has changed its attitude on the desirability of out-of-town centres since the development at Dumplington was given the go-ahead last March. Local authorities opposing the scheme claimed that when planning permission was granted last year, following a public inquiry in 1988, Mr Michael Howard, then environment secretary, failed to consider changed circumstances. The authorities, led by Manchester City Council, told the court that development by Peel Holdings would increase traffic pollution and harm town-centre shops. The court found that Mr Howard had failed to provide adequate reasons for granting planning permission. It concluded that his reasoning had been so unclear on a wide range of issues that he had either acted outside his powers or to the substantial prejudice of the objecting authorities. Both were grounds for quashing his decision. However, it gave leave for an early appeal to the House of Lords, which Peel said it would take advantage of. The airing of the issue could prove embarrassing to the Department of the Environment whose recent planning-guidance notes to local authorities discourages developments which require people to travel. Mr John Adams, an associate partner specialising in retail developments at Drivers Jonas, chartered surveyors, said the most likely outcome would be a further public inquiry if the Lords reject the appeal. He added that local demand for retail space would increase strongly over the next 10 years. A further inquiry would delay development by up to another 18 months. The share price of Peel Holdings yesterday fell 31p to 312p - a decline of 9 per cent. The 300-acre Dumplington site was the subject of a bitter three-year takeover battle for the Manchester Ship Canal won by Mr John Whittaker, chairman of Peel Holdings in 1987. The canal company's separate Stock Exchange quotation was absorbed into Peel's last year after a blocking minority of shareholders - led by Mr Nicholas Berry - agreed to be bought out for Pounds 30 a share. Of that, Pounds 7 was in Pounds 1 negotiable loan coupons, redeemable on Dumplington's development, or in 1998, whichever came first. Even if the company is eventually successful, it is unlikely it would be able to start building in 1997 as planned. This could have implications for the extension of Manchester's new tram system to Salford Quays, Trafford Park and eventually to Dumplington, which Peel was going to help pay for.</p>

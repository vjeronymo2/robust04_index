			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Painful and protracted birth of a nation: Uzbekistan is attempting the difficult task of reviving its economy and establishing a secular government After just four months' training in the US, Mr Rustam Azimov, 33, is the most experienced banker in the newly independent republic of Uzbekistan. Although an able chairman of the National Bank for Foreign Economic Activity, Mr Azimov is looking forward to the return of colleagues from abroad to help him handle the republic's international banking operations. 'Before, we never had to deal with such matters,' he explains. 'Now we are counting on our young people to quickly absorb everything we need to know.' Just a short drive across Tashkent, in the old part of the Uzbek capital, but a world apart in how they see their future, dozens of teenage girls in white headscarves are studying the Koran at religious instruction classes. Their veiled teacher, a retired construction engineer who 10 years ago would never have covered her face, wants an 'Islamic state' in which women would no longer be allowed to work in factories, on farms, or building sites. These two faces of Uzbekistan  - on one hand a shortage of business skills and on the other the appeal of long-suppressed religious and ethnic values  -pose a dilemma for this Central Asian republic as it seeks simultaneously to build an independent state and switch to a market economy. While Islam remains a largely dormant force  - Uzbeks consider themselves Moslems though few know what this entails  - a failure to deal with structural economic challenges could open the way for a state governed by religious laws. The difficult transition from the one-party state to a more pluralist political system is being closely watched by the American government, and by neighbouring countries  - particularly Turkey and Iran. All are seeking to fill the vacuum left by the collapse of communist rule in Uzbekistan, as well as Turkmenia, Tajikistan and Kirghizia, the other three former Soviet Central republics. The US, anxious to guard against Islamic fundamentalism, earlier this year became the first foreign country to establish an embassy in Tashkent. Turkey, a Nato ally which enjoys unrivalled prestige in Uzbekistan because of ethnic links with Central Asia and because of its economic success, is being held up by President Islam Karimov as a model of development. By this, he means a secular state which respects the country's Moslem identity but keeps religion separate from government. Despite the competition for regional influence there are also moves for co-operation. This weekend, presidents of the Central Asian republics will meet in the Turkmen capital Ashkhabad with leaders of Iran, Turkey and Pakistan to consolidate new economic ties. Economic development is a high priority for Uzbekistan's 20m inhabitants. But they face daunting problems. The discovery of oil in the republic on March 2  - the day that it joined the United Nations  - was seen as a gift of God. But it will take more than oil to build a market economy. The republic is a net importer of consumer goods, food and, until now, energy. It has also traditionally relied on funds from Moscow for up to 30 per cent of its budget expenditures. Traditionally a supplier of raw materials first to the Russian empire and then to the Soviet Union, Uzbekistan is now trying, with varying degrees of success, to sell its commodities on international markets, without going through Moscow. With this aim, Mr Azimov's bank was founded last October by the state-owned enterprises that account for the bulk of the republic's wealth. Uzbekistan has one main advantage over many other former Soviet republics: its vast natural resources. Apart from the newly discovered oil fields, it is the world's third-largest cotton grower and seventh-biggest gold producer. 'We were a colony and we remain a colony,' argues Mr Azimov, who complains that Uzbekistan develops only 8 per cent to 10 per cent of its raw materials internally. The rest is exported to plants in Russia or abroad  - with a Russian cotton shirt selling for 30 times the price of the Uzbek raw cotton which went into making it. Uzbekistan is now seeking foreign investment to help it process more of its wealth. As well as trying to increase profits from natural resources, the ruling National Democratic party (the former Communist party) is taking hesitant steps towards introducing a market economy. But, as in other former Soviet republics, the measures have met resistance. Price liberalisation in January provoked student riots that were brutally put down. Speeding up the distribution of wealth is seen as crucial in maintaining social stability, given the demographic legacy of decades of lopsided development. The decision by Soviet economic planners that Central Asia should focus on agriculture deprived Uzbekistan of an industrial base and  - given the tradition of big families in rural areas  - fuelled population growth. The population of Central Asia is growing by 1m people a year, 600,000 of them in Uzbekistan. This in turn generates an ever-growing demand for land and water resources. The depletion of the Aral Sea is a result  - one of the great ecological disasters of the 20th century.</p>

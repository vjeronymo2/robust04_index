This  is what Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez will reiterate tomorrow  when he receives separately the top leaders of the trade unions  and the employers' organization. His proposal will be very  clear: New topics -- the incomes agreement, the social  protection model, the occupational health bill, or the reform of  pensions -- can be negotiated, but the labor reform will not be  touched in anything substantial. In the letter which he sent to  trade union leaders Nicolas Redondo and Antonio Gutierrez  yesterday, the prime minister reiterates that any change is  subject to prior agreement between the employers' organization  and the trade unions; a virtually impossible condition, as the  Spanish Confederation of Employers Organizations made clear.  The trade unions received Gonzalez' message with  "disappointment."    Jose Maria Zufiaur asserted that it is "political suicide"  to  seek to disregard the general strike and ignore millions of  workers' rejection of the labor reform.    The prime minister's letter gives some clues to the  government's intentions. It suggests negotiation of an incomes  agreement to the trade unions and reminds them that the labor  reform is passing through parliament. In addition, Labor  Ministry officials are preparing a list of new topics which can  begin to be negotiated -- the social protection system, the  occupational health bill, or the reform of future pensions.    Secretary General of the Prime Minister's Office Miguel Gil  confirmed to EL PAIS that the labor measures will not be  renegotiated, but other matters, which are "certainly important,  such as the incomes agreement," can be discussed.    On the labor market, Gonzalez refers to accepting "changes  consistent with the meaning of the reform which enjoy the  agreement of the trade unions and the employers' organization."    Time is an adverse factor, because the period for the  parliamentary groups to submit their partial amendments to the  three bills in hand expires 8 February. Afterward, until their  approval in the Senate -- it is estimated that this could be in  June -- there is always some chance of introducing changes,  although it is certainly more difficult now.

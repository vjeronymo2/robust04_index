			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / International Company News: Oce-van der Grinten falls 50% OCE-VAN der Grinten, the Dutch office equipment and photocopier maker, saw net profit tumble by nearly 50 per cent in the 1992-1993 first quarter as the economic slowdown in Europe hit sales. Net profit was virtually halved to Fl 10.8m (Dollars 6.0m) from Fl 21.1m a year earlier. Sales were down 7 per cent at Fl 609.2m, with European sales in particular under pressure because of generally weak economic conditions. In the US, sales and profits rose, the company said. Operating profit plummeted by 56 per cent to Fl 14.6m, though this was partly balanced by a rise of more than one-third in interest income from financial leases to Fl 22m. However, the higher trend in financial leases also caused financing charges to rise by Fl 3m to Fl 23.3m. In the engineering system market, encompassing both copying and plotting equipment, sales tumbled by more than 10 per cent. Oce said it expected several new machines launched recently at the Hanover Fair to make a 'clear contribution' to sales in the second half. In office copying and printing equipment, the sales decline was more moderate, at 3 per cent. The company did not comment on the outlook for profits later this year. In February, Oce had warned it expected to see lower results in the first six months of 1992-1993 and an improvement in the second half.</p>

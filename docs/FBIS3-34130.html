			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Bassam Abu-Sharif, adviser to PLO Chairman </F> Yasir 'Arafat, by correspondent Huda al-Husayni in London; date  not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Abu-Sharif] There is no doubt that the delay in the  implementation of the first-step agreement will make the  Palestinians and the Arabs doubt the seriousness of the Israeli  Government's stand. Furthermore, the continuation of occupation  and shooting at Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank  will draw more resistance. This will renew the cycle of  violence and endanger the whole agreement.    [Al-Husayni] Some people say the continuation of violence in  the occupied territory will prompt a negative Israeli reaction  and make it refuse to implement this agreement.    [Abu-Sharif] The fact is that the cycle of violence was  generated by the presence of occupation and the shooting at  Palestinians by Israeli soldiers, not the opposite. Palestinian  reaction is a legitimate and human resistance.    [Al-Husayni] Hamas, however, has been accused of killing  Israelis.    [Abu-Sharif] The reaction of the Palestinians -- students,  women, men, and old men -- is a reaction to Israeli measures,  not the opposite. This is the reaction of the Palestinian  people.    [Al-Husayni] Israeli officials have been stating that they  are concerned about Israel's security. Why was the agreement  concluded in the first place if it would endanger Israel's  security?    [Abu-Sharif] We understand Israelis' fears regarding their  security. However, they should understand that we also have our  own fears regarding the security issue. It is our people who  are in need of protection. We can conclude by saying that our  people will continue the resistance as long as the occupation  continues.    [Al-Husayni] My last question is the following: Did Yasir  'Arafat really dispatch some of his personal guards for training  in the United States?    [Abu-Sharif] I do not know whether they were dispatched to  the United States specifically, however, I know that quite a  good number of the presidential guards are receiving training in  more than one Western country.</p>

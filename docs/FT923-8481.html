			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Management: When a little knowledge is a good thing - Just the Job If you can get together a few vehicle-owners who have 'The Knowledge' - cab drivers' jargon for knowing where all the streets of a town are - then you are well on your way to forming a courier service. There is a glut of dispatch companies in London and most big cities, but there is still room for competition in smaller towns. Courier businesses can require heavy investment if you aim to serve a large area - and the pay-back period can be long. However, more modest services limited to one neighbourhood can be quite profitable based on a smaller outlay. The basic set-up requires an office with a phone, and a control centre where an operator can keep in touch with the couriers and relay orders via radio or bleepers. The vehicles needn't all be high-powered motorcycles. A car or even a bicycle will do when delivery time is not too important. You will have to advertise, and that means using mailshots, and running ads in the local press or on commercial radio. A dispatch rider's average delivery radius is around 30 miles, but you will have to determine your own realistic radius based on your resources. Small courier companies make a profit of about Pounds 35,000 a year, which may not seem much. But that is just the average. There are success stories. In 1976, 21-year-old Richard Gabriel left his job and set up a dispatch company called Roadrunner with a friend. The venture was initially a success but later faltered because of partnership problems. However, Gabriel was determined to continue and had the novel idea of setting up a national franchise network. The result was Interlink Express, which was later sold to an Australian group in 1991 for more than Pounds 36 million. For professional advice on setting up a courier service, dial 100 and ask for Freefone Enterprise. They will give you the address of your local Small Firms Service.</p>

			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RECREATION / BOATING;  </P> <P> IT'S SAFETY FIRST FOR BODYBOARDERS;  </P> <P> 'KNOW YOUR OCEAN' AND 'BE AFRAID' ARE THE KEY CREDOS TAUGHT TO YOUNGSTERS  </P> <P> Jill Bramlette's bodyboarding classes all begin with the same lesson: Be afraid  of the water.  </P> <P> Yet, when Bramlette asks her students, "Do you have any fear of the water?" the  answer is a resounding, "No!"  </P> <P> After all, these are adventurous 7- and 8-year-olds, mostly boys, strong  swimmers who are fearless and competitive.  </P> <P> That's why safety is the primary emphasis of Bramlette's classes, offered for  the first time this summer by the Dana Point Harbor Youth and Group Facility.  </P> <P> Bodyboarding, a simpler, easier alternative to riding a surfboard, has been  around since the early 1970s, when former Laguna Beach resident Tom Morey  developed the Boogie Board, a short polyethylene board that has become a  popular beach plaything. Riders lie on the 4-foot-long boards, either straight  with the wave or cutting across the wave's surface for more sophisticated  riders.  </P> <P> Today, every weekend you can see hundreds of bodyboarders riding the surf along  the county's beaches. Many are children such as those in Bramlette's classes,  for which the minimum age is 7. Participants must have their own equipment and  be able to swim.  </P> <P> Sixteen young bodyboarders sat on the grass near Doheny State Beach one recent  weekend as Bramlette, longtime surfer and surf instructor, lectured them on the  importance of respecting the power of the ocean.  </P> <P> "Everyone told me they had no fear of the water," she said. "But the ocean is  so powerful, it can really do some damage. You need to develop a healthy fear  of it. A healthy respect."  </P> <P> One of the most important rules of bodyboarding, Bramlette said, is learning  how to assess the ocean before you go out. Don't even think about doing a drop  knee, stand up or el rollo -- all popular maneuvers -- until you have first  thought about currents, tides, wave heights, sand bars and underwater rocks.  </P> <P> "A friend of mine dove into the water and it was shallower than he thought and  he broke his neck and now he is paralyzed," she said. "So you should always  assess the situation before you go diving into it."  </P> <P> One of the most important accessories a bodyboarder should have, Bramlette  said, is a tide chart for the target area.  </P> <P> "Right now, it's high tide," she said, glancing at the ocean. "The waves are  breaking close to shore. But what is usually out there?"  </P> <P> She pointed to a section of beach close to a jetty. Zack Hickle, 8, looked to  where Bramlette was pointing and said, "Rocks."  </P> <P> "That's right," she said. "They are covered with water now because it is high  tide. But you need to know they're there."  </P> <P> Bramlette cautioned her young students never to surf near piers, jetties or  rocks, especially if there is a current. She also advised them not to venture  out when conditions are dangerous.  </P> <P> When they do go out, she suggested that they have a lineup point on the beach  so they can determine how currents are affecting them.  </P> <P> The lineup point can be a lifeguard tower, a rock -- any fixed point on the  land. "You know how your moms get mad if you go out and she says, 'Stay in  front of me' and you end up down the beach somewhere? Well, think of your mom  as your lineup point," she said.  </P> <P> Bramlette also offers this advice:  </P> <P> * Watch for other boards, other swimmers and other objects all the time.  </P> <P> * Hold onto the board to keep it from hitting other swimmers. (Most boards are  attached to the rider's wrist by a leash.)  </P> <P> * Learn surfer etiquette. (For example, the surfer closest to the wave crest  has the right of way.)  </P> <P> * Always wear swim fins.  </P> <P> * Always wear a waterproof sunscreen.  </P> <P> * Always keep your hands out in front to protect your head in a fall.  </P> <P> * Don't panic. "Always keep yourself in control. Never do anything that is  uncomfortable, and never go out alone. If you find yourself caught in a 6-foot  wave set and it gets kind of scary out there, paddle out beyond it and wait.  Then come in on a smaller wave set."  </P> <P> Although some of the content of the class is very basic, parents like Herb  Hickle are grateful for the emphasis on safety. Hickle's sons, Zack, 8, and  Tyler, 7, are both enrolled in the course.  </P> <P> "Both of them have been rescued by the San Clemente lifeguards," Hickle said.  "This class is wonderful for them. This is one of those sports that when  parents stand back on the beach, it looks simple, but it is not as simple as it  looks."  </P> <P> Peter Spenuzza, who enrolled in the class with his 8-year-old son, Peter Jr.,  said, "We've both been doing this and needed to learn more about water safety,  currents and all that."  </P> <P> The class will be offered again Saturday and Aug. 25. For information, call  (714) 661-7122.  </P> <P> Sculling and rowing -- Have you always wanted to try sculling or rowing? The  Newport Aquatic Center offers introductory clinics at 9 a.m. every Saturday.  Cost is $5. For information, call (714) 646-7725. The center is at 1  Whitecliffs Drive in Newport Beach.  </P> <P> Catalina cruising -- The Women's Ocean Racing Sailing Assn. will hold a cruise  to Santa Catalina Island Aug. 24-26. The event is open to all members, friends  and family, according to Shannon Aikman, president. For information, call (714)  548-8755.  </P> <P> Boating classes -- Two 13-week boating classes will be offered by Flotilla 15-4  of the Coast Guard Auxiliary. A class for powerboaters will begin Sept. 12, one  for sailboaters Sept. 13. Classes will meet from 7 to 9:30 p.m. at Tustin High  School, 1171 E. Camino Real, Tustin.

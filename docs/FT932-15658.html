			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: BES; cause for anxiety THE DUST is still settling on the most tempestuous year for the business expansion scheme. Now, it starts its last nine months before being abolished at the end of 1993. Total investment in BES companies more than doubled, to Pounds 957m, in the 1992-93 tax year compared with Pounds 367m in 1991-92, according to figures from the Allenbridge group. In many cases, last year's investors will have received excellent deals. But they have cause now to be anxious that the sponsors who put these together did not take any short cuts with the paperwork involved. The Inland Revenue gives every impression of having lost patience. This might be because the BES has lost touch with the high-risk start-up companies it was supposed to help. Allenbridge's figures show that only Pounds 7m went to trading companies last year, the worst level since the BES began. But assured tenancies took Pounds 950m, of which Pounds 880m went to schemes with contracted exits. In three separate cases, tax inspectors have laid down a strict interpretation of BES rules and are threatening to deny relief. These cases are: Johnson Fry's schemes, launched just before last year's general election, which bought accommodation for University College, London. The schemes had not received provisional approval and the Revenue believes regulations may have been broken because the accommodation was let to conferences during the summer vacation. Loan-back schemes launched before the Budget by Barclays de Zoete Wedd and the National Westminster bank. Each scheme took Pounds 25m and allotted shares before the deadline, but the Revenue is not convinced the shares were issued correctly to shareholders in time. Country Gardens, a series of trading companies which raised Pounds 15m under the BES in 1985, 1986 and 1987. Investors have been asked by the Revenue to return their tax relief with interest. Inspectors decided the companies were in technical breach of regulations by operating a non-qualifying subsidiary and holding too much money in cash. These episodes suggest that investors should avoid sponsors which lack experience, or schemes that stretch the rules. But what are the prospects for supply over the rest of the year? The abolition of non-recourse loans has not damaged the economics for building societies of using the BES for repossessions - it remains cheap finance for them. But the lack of a quick exit route means societies would have to be prepared to raise money over several months, which makes the BES less attractive. The Halifax is now unlikely to use the scheme. It points out that raising funds this way is too complex, although it is still considering the BES as an option. But the Building Society Association disagrees, and there will be plenty of repossessed housing available to BES companies for the rest of the year. Investors have another problem. The issues are confused this year because the BES season will end with the calendar year, not the tax year. An imminent deadline could allow intermediaries to hurry investors into making decisions, but it would be wise to resist the pressure. If you do not know how much top-rate tax you would need to pay for the 1993-94 tax year, you should err on the side of caution.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] At a time when preparations are under way for a  meeting between Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa and Sudanese  Foreign Minister Dr. Husayn Abu-Talib, differences have again  arisen over the Hala'ib triangle after the Sudanese Government  has granted development projects there to foreign companies.  Moreover, the Sudanese Government has appointed officials to  administer the region, moved some military units closer to the  border, and set up a center headed by a number of senior  officers from the Military Operations Department.    Diplomatic sources have noted that the Sudanese measures  conflict with the agreement that the two foreign ministers  reached on the sidelines of the Arab League meeting last month.  That agreement stipulates that neither side shall take any  measures that might jeopardize the negotiations on resolving the  crisis over Hala'ib.    The new Sudanese moves have surprised the Egyptian  Government, especially since the Sudanese Government has  expressed its readiness to accept the Egyptian documents on the  dispute. The Sudanese Government had previously rejected these  documents, claiming they were forged British documents.    Sudan's flexibility toward Hala'ib came after Egypt  expressed  its opposition to any attempt for secession in southern Sudan.  In a telephone conversation with [Sudanese President] 'Umar  al-Bashir, President Mubarak said Egypt would do its utmost to  prevent the south from seceding from the north.    Meanwhile, Syria is continuing to mediate between Cairo and  Khartoum. It is trying to increase the meetings between  Egyptian and Sudanese officials and to bridge the differences in  their views.</p>

			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: JIM AND TAMMY SHOW  </P> <P> Despite the recent conviction of televangelist Jim Bakker on 24 counts of fraud  and other charges, the networks apparently aren't rushing to bring the sordid  scandal to the small screen.  </P> <P> "God and Greed: The Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker Story," which Finnegan-Pinchuk  Prod. had in development at CBS for about a year -- without the Bakkers'  blessings -- is currently without a home. The network "informed us they were  not going forward with the movie prior to the convictions," exec producer  Sheldon Pinchuk told us.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, "Fall From Grace," which NBC put into development after optioning  dramatic rights from the couple in 1987, is without a production date.

			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Man In The News: Populist with a passion for power - Lindsey Halstead Mr Lindsey Halstead, the tough-talking American chairman of Ford of Europe, has had some difficult explaining to do to his bosses at Ford's world headquarters in Detroit over the past 12 months. Ford last year achieved record vehicle sales in Europe. At the same time it collapsed into loss. Often in the past 10 years Ford of Europe has come to the rescue of its US parent, churning out profits to help cushion the disasters being faced by the world's second-largest vehicle maker in its domestic north American market. In 1991 the wheels fell off in both north America and Europe, however, with the result that Ford will soon announce billion-dollar losses for 1991. The worldwide automotive operations had racked up net losses of Dollars 2.47bn in the first nine months of last year. Mr Halstead has had an uncomfortable ride since easing himself into the driving seat at Ford's European headquarters to the east of London three years ago. Though he inherited record net profits for Ford's European operations of Dollars 1.562bn in 1988, in the past three years the profits have evaporated, slipping to Dollars 1.289bn in 1989, Dollars 263m in 1990 and into loss last year. The decline has been as steep as the fall of Mr Halstead's beloved ski slopes in Colorado. To rub salt in his wounds, Mr Halstead has been forced to watch Ford's European glory be usurped by General Motors, its much bigger US rival, but traditionally a loss-making laggard in the European arena. Now the tables have been turned with a vengeance. GM (Opel in continental Europe and Vauxhall in the UK) achieved record group net profits of Dollars 1.915bn in Europe in 1990. Mr Halstead has not been idle. Joined by a new deputy in the bulky shape of Mr Bill Fike as Ford of Europe president last April, he has been trying to galvanise the bloated Ford bureaucracy into action. Late last year, 300 senior managers from Ford's European automotive operations gathered in Cologne to hear the new gospel according to Halstead and Fike. The duo launched their 'Drive for Leadership' campaign. 'When we meet again in April, we will review results, not more plans,' the managers were told by the combative Mr Fike. He told the managers that the Japanese are 'the critical challenge in Europe. 'Their increased presence will create additional pressure on all manufacturers to improve quality, reduce costs, and compete for market share through improved products and aggressive pricing actions. 'The battle in Europe has begun - and truly only the fittest will survive.' Mr Halstead, 61, a Ford veteran who joined the company in 1952 as a service parts analyst, was previously vice-president of both Ford's Latin American and Asia-Pacific operations. In Latin America he led Ford's negotiations with Volkswagen to merge their businesses. At Asia-Pacific he confronted the Japanese auto industry, an experience that left him with what might be carefully described as a respectful hostility for his Asian rivals. He did not baulk at being referred to as 'Jacques' Halstead, after one of his more outspoken speeches appeared to put him in the same camp as the protectionist Jacques Calvet, chief executive of Peugeot, the French car maker. Mr Halstead and Mr Fike have drawn up a broad agenda for change in Europe - the job cuts announced for the UK yesterday are part of the plan - that includes: Attacking rigidities in organisation and structure with the so-called '30/30/30' guidelines. The plan is to reduce the number of indirect salaried staff, foreign service employees and certain layers of management by at least 30 per cent by the end of 1993. Aiming for a 25 per cent cut in investment spending by 1997 without reducing quality. Earlier supplier participation, simultaneous engineering, and early definition of customer requirements are all considered vital to gain greater investment efficiency. Improving productivity and quality, in particular at the UK Dagenham and Halewood vehicle assembly plants. Mr Albert Caspers, a key Halstead lieutenant as vice-president of Ford of Europe's engineering and vehicle manufacturing group, says Dagenham improved its productivity by 21 per cent between 1985 and 1989, but 'despite this improvement Dagenham units (the Fiesta small car) are still substantially more expensive to produce than Cologne's' Of Halewood, he says simply: 'There is a long way to go, but we believe we are making progress.' Reducing the complexity of model lines by cutting the number of so-called 'build combinations'; introducing simultaneous engineering with the ultimate ambition of reducing new model development times from the 72 months of the recent past to only 36 months; and attacking design cost and materials cost by cutting the number of components suppliers and giving them much more research and development responsibility. Mr Halstead admits he felt thwarted in trying to convey the urgency of his drive-for-leadership message to Ford of Europe's middle management. 'I got frustrated with the speed at which as an organisation we were addressing the need to be more customer driven. 'We have to make more decisions down below in the organisation. If you take enough people out at the top, the critical work still gets done. It is working, but it is a slow process.' Ford has always been rightly famed for its financial control systems, for rule by the bean counters, but Mr Halstead insists that such an approach is deeply flawed in today's marketplace. 'We have been a cost-driven rather than a product-driven company. The Japanese have done a good job. If you look at customer research and customer satisfaction indices they have scored better.' Ford of Europe has been dragged down in the past two years by its performance in the UK, traditionally its big money spinner. It persistently underestimated the depth of the recession and was left with capacity where it had no sales in the UK, but with demand in Germany which it did not have the capacity to satisfy. Mr Halstead and Mr Fike insist that Ford's European operations are now in better balance, but as more job cuts are announced for the UK Mr Halstead pulls no punches over the threat facing the British operations if they do not shape up. 'It isn't the facilities that are different, there is not a damn thing wrong with the Halewood facility. It is the way labour is organised and the way labour functions . . . You have to close the gap (with continental Europe) eventually, or you have to shift capacity because eventually you will have to say 'to hell with it'.'</p>

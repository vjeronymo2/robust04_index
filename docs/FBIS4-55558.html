			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aleksa Crnjakovic on a news conference by Stipe </F> Mesic and Josip Manolic with foreign and domestic correspondants  preceding the Assembly session in Zagreb on 17 May: "The HND  Proposes That the Discussion on the Replacement of Assembly  Figures Be Postponed"]    [Excerpts] Claiming at the very beginning that the  upcoming assembly session would be a routine one, despite the  desire for creating an illusion of the Parliament activities  being obstructed, Chamber of Representatives President Stipe  Mesic and House of Counties President Josip Manolic answered  many open questions at the news conference held just before the  assembly session. There is great interest in the upcoming  session, as the most topical issues, from relieving Josipa  Manolic of his duties and appointing a new president of the  House of Counties, to the alleged demand for the resignation of  Defense Minister Gojko Susak and Minister of Culture Vesna  Jurkic Girardi, are on the agenda.    President Manolic reminded him that the HDZ [Croatian  Democratic Community] wanted to relieve him of his duties as  president of the Chamber of Counties very quickly. He also  reminded of the reasons for founding the HND [Croatian  Independent Democrats], stating that was what changed the  political balance of powers in the Assembly and the political  scene in Croatia. Manolic claims that the opposition was thus  strengthened as a whole, which was the main goal. The  unsuccessful attempt at replacing him started the parliamentary  crisis, said Manolic. A resolution can occur either through an  agreement of all those involved in the crisis, or by holding  preterm elections, which would not suit anybody.    "We have managed to carry out a differentiation process both  within and outside the assembly, we have strengthened the  position of the entire opposition, and partly managed to break  the monopoly of one party and one man. We want the party that  has had the monopoly until now to continue the differentiation  process. We accept the challenge. We want to form our own club  and to be entitled to the same rights in conducting talks."    Manolic also told the reporters that the HND had proposed to  the HDZ that the item relating to replacing the presidents of  the two parliament chambers be taken off the agenda so that any  possibility of obstructing the activities of the parliament and  the expensive marathon-like sessions are avoided. The HND  further proposed to put the item on the agenda in 15 to 20 days,  but only after the agreement of all the parties on the  redistribution of all the important positions is reached.  Manolic predicted that there would be "pulling and pushing"  about this issue if the HDZ does not accept the proposal.  <H5>  Seks' Threats </H5>   In the introductory part of the news conference, Manolic  repeated his statement that certain representatives were  pressured and seriously threatened. He quoted the words of  Vladimir Seks, spoken in Vinkovci: "Croatia does not have  capital punishment, but we will take Manolic and Mesic's heads  off." " Why are there threats and on whose behalf? The times  of a one-party state are behind us, and the time of real  parliamentary decision making is ahead of us. We will defend  the autonomy of the assembly," said Manolic. He mentioned the  non-democratic behavior during the forming of the State  Tribunal, explained why some opposition representatives have  been asking that discussions of topical issues, such as the  resignations of Gojko Susak and Vesna Girardi Jurkic, and the  teachers' strike, be held at the Assembly. "The Assembly can  not neglect these problems," remarked Manolic.    He has asked that issues that were up until now untouchable,  covered by the veil of "military secrets," be discussed at the  assembly.    The questions of the reporters then followed.    [Zeljko Peratovic] Did you attend the party meeting at the  Presidential Palace in the morning?    [Mesic] I was invited, but I did not know who it was that  invited me, so I did not go. I had a short meeting with leaders  of some opposition parties at the Assembly, and agreed with them  that we had to discuss the new balance of powers after we  founded the Club of the HND. I did not go to the meeting -- I  did not want to go before it was determined what Deputy  President Seks said, why he openly threatened us. Such  vocabulary becomes a traveling circus.  <H5>  "What Resignation?!" </H5>   [VJESNIK] Why did you write a letter to U.S. congressmen,  claiming that the Washington agreement is not being implemented,  when the Vienna agreement had already been signed at that time?    [Mesic] The time we sent the letter does not match the time  of the signing of the Vienna agreement. We sent the letter to  point out that the arms embargo must be lifted, so that the  people can defend themselves. We also pointed out that there  were forces that want to prevent the implementation of the  Washington agreement.    [VJESNIK] Which forces are preventing the implementation of  the Washington agreement; did you discuss that with Mr.  Galbraith?    [Manolic] At the time we sent the letter, a discussion had  started in the U.S. Congress regarding the lifting of the arms  embargo, which was during the time of the fiercest attacks on  Gorazde, when the international forces were not capable of  protecting the Muslims. We also asked that the embargo on  Croatia be lifted, because that is the only way we can defend  ourselves from the Serb agressor. President Tudjman said at a  certain point that he opposed the lifting of the embargo, and he  has not taken it back, although circumstances have changed.    [Dijana Rexhepi] When do you expect that a peaceful  reintegration of the UNPA's [UN Protection Areas] will take  place?    [Mesic] We want rule-of-law in Croatia, in which authorities  are divided into three parts, in which European standards are  applied, and in which every citizen will have guarantees that  they will be protected.    [Sead Saracevic] You claim that the HND is the second most  powerful party in Croatia. How would you account for that?    [Manolic] We are the number two parliamentary opposition  party; 10 representatives have gone over to us. They claim that  we have a stud of Trojan horses. They are not a stud; they are  representatives who have names.    [Mesic] I would say they are thoroughbreads.    [Dejan Jovic] What positions in the Assembly would you  demand for the HND? Which parties attended the meeting?    [Mesic] There is a new reality in the Assembly. Now we have  to sit down and talk, but without previous conditions. We will  not accept ultimatums. We want partnership, fair talks, and a  gentlemen-like agreement. We talked to Savka Dabcevic-Kucar  [president of the Croatian National Party, HNS], Drazen Budisa  [president of the Croatian Social Liberal Party, HSLS], Djapic  [leader of the Croatian Rights Party, HSP], Ivica Racan  [president of the Party of Democratic Changes, SDP], and a HSS  [Croatian Peasants Party] representative also attended, while  some were not able to attend. We will meet for a discussion  again, after the talks in the Presidential Palace are over.  <H5>  The World Is Breaking Over Bosnia-Herzegovina </H5>   [REUTER] What does your criticism of the government relate  to?    [Mesic] We have not criticized the government; the  government has worked within the provided framework, and we  support it. Our criticism relates to state politics, the  policies toward Bosnia-Herzegovina in particular. The HDZ has  responded to two historical challenges: getting out of the  Communist-Bolshevist surroundings, and founding a state. Now  the question arises what kind of Croatia we want. We want  rule-of-law, in which everyone will be doing their job within  the framework of the Constitution and the laws. We have  encountered obstacles there. President Tudjman said that  rule-of-law would function only when all the territories are  liberated, and we think that rule-of-law can function in the  liberated parts. When it comes to Bosnia-Herzegovina, we  believe it should remain within its borders, and that the world  should not violate the principle of inviolability of borders, as  if this is done, the Serb Republic in Bosnia-Herzegovina could  be annexed to Serbia and it could pull the occupied parts of  Croatia along. At the time we were inferior in weapons, we  opened the front with the Muslims too, although we had a common  aggressor. The results of this policy are evident: tens of  thousands killed and exiled, houses destroyed.    [Ingrid Badurina] What is your interpretation of the  disunion in relation to the percentages of the territory that is  supposed to belong to the Muslim-Croat Federation? In Vienna  there was talk about 58 percent, while in Geneva 51 percent was  being mentioned.    [Mesic] The international community must take efficient  action that would make the third side realize what reality is,  that is not allow that borders be changed through aggression.    [Manolic] The world is breaking over Bosnia-Herzegovina, and  this is why this illogicality. However, that still does not  mean that the Serbs will not find a place for themselves in the  Federation.    [Olga Ramljak] You support legality, but you do not want the  vote of no confidence to take place, although, in accordance  with the procedure, the issue was put on the agenda. Why is  that? Moreover, you have addressed the U.S. Congress, while you  reproached others for doing so.    [Mesic] We have the right to address the international  public if the Croatian people are in danger, and the arms  embargo is disadvantageous to the Croat people. We are against  measures being taken against Manolic only because he expressed  his opinion. President Tudjman announced there would be  proceedings before the Court of Honor because Manolic did not  take back what he said, but while we were in the meeting, there  was a phone call saying signatures were being collected.  Manolic should have been given the chance to defend himself  before the Court of Honor. It is to these methods that we  object.    [Manolic] We have put the issue of the relieving the  president of the Chamber of Counties on the agenda, but at the  session we will propose that it be taken off the agenda if the  proposer -- the Club of the HDZ -- accepts it. If it is not  accepted, the session will be conducted according to the agenda.  As far as the accusations, the "traitors addressing the world"  are concerned, we have not accused Croatia, but the policy that  has isolated Croatia from the rest of the world, led it into  social unrest, and almost destroyed it.  <H5>  "Kuna -- a Concession to the Herzegovinian Lobby" </H5>   [REUTER] How much influence does the Herzegovinian lobby  have on Croatian politics, and who is against the Washington  agreement?    [Manolic] It is a large lobby. The Vienna agreement has  provided answers to Gojko Susak's war aims. However, what is  left of them? Tens of thousands of dead and exiled. None of  these war aims have been achieved. We know in advance who will  oppose the Vienna agreement: the same people who started the  war against the Muslims.    [Jasmina Kuzmanovic] Allegedly, the decision was made that  the kuna be introduced in Herzeg-Bosna too. Is that correct?    [Manolic] The kuna is a minor issue, although it is  interesting that within one year the Law on the Croatian Bank  Note has been changed twice. The decision on the kuna was made  at the time of the greatest conflicts with the Muslims in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, thus being a concession to the Herzegovinian  lobby.    [Mesic] There is no mention of Herzeg-Bosna in the  Washington agreement, and therefore there is no mention of the  kuna being introduced either. That would not have been support  to the implementation of the Washington agreement.    [Unidentified foreign correspondent] Will you disclose the  names of the representatives who have become members of the HND?    [Mesic] Yes.</p>

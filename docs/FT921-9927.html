			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Business failures at peak last year COMPANY insolvencies in England and Wales reached a record last year with a 45 per cent increase on the 1990 total, according to Department of Trade and Industry figures released yesterday. However, the seasonally adjusted figures for the final quarter of 1991 fell by 5 per cent to 5,554 compared with the previous three months, indicating that the peak of business failures may have passed. The figures, published in the magazine of the Association of British Chambers of Commerce, showed that 21,827 companies became insolvent during 1991. That represents 2.3 per cent of the number of active companies registered at Companies House during 1991, compared with 1.6 per cent in the previous year. The number of compulsory liquidations for companies in Scotland increased by 21 per cent to 304 last year and the number of creditors' voluntary liquidations by 41 per cent to 309. Both showed a slight decline between the third and fourth quarters. Mr Eric Forth, minister for small firms, said: 'While the continuing rise in insolvencies is of course a cause for concern, it is heartening to see that there are further signs of an easing in the upward trend, particularly in company liquidations.' However, Mr Ron Taylor, director-general of the association, cautioned that signs of economic recovery have in the past lead to an increase in the number of insolvencies. The government should do everything it could 'to leave cash in business' pockets', he declared. Mr Steven Hill, a partner with Cork Gully, the insolvency arm of Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, said the high failure rate reflected the high growth in company formation during the 1980s, as well as the impact of excessive borrowing and the recession.</p>

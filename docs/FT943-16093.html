			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Incentive comes with ownership Sir, There is no need to look to America to see the advantages of employee ownership ('Benefit of employee ownership', June 25). Research published last month by the Esop Centre showed that managers of more than four out of five non-quoted British companies with employee share ownership plans (Esops) felt their employees were better motivated and more productive because of the Esop. Furthermore, 58 per cent of managers of Esop companies said their profits had grown faster than their competitors, with the rest saying profits had grown at the same level. The share prices of companies with Esops grew by an astonishing 43 per cent every year, on average. Those companies whose share prices have performed the best, however, are the ones which communicate with their employees and provide them with information. Conversely, those companies which have made no changes to management-employee communication since setting up an Esop have been ones with the worst performing share prices. Statistics such as these persuaded the government to relax some of the restrictions on setting up statutory Esops in this year's Finance Act. Malcolm Hurlston, chairman, The Esop Centre, 2 Ridgmount Street, London WC1E 7AA</p>

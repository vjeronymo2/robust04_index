			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EPA has also determined that provisions need to be added to subparts F and I to provide a mechanism for owners or operators to request case-by-case compliance extensions for delays due to unavailability of parts. Since replacement seal systems and barrier fluid systems are designed for the compressor and the unit, it is possible that the vendor company may not be able to provide the replacement system on schedule and there would be no other vendor who could quickly provide the parts. When the EPA established the compliance date for the compressor provisions, the possible need for such a compliance extension was not recognized. Therefore, the EPA is proposing to allow application for a compliance extension in cases where replacement of the seal system or barrier fluid system is required and additional time is necessary due to unavailability of parts. The proposed language is presented in new paragraph &sect;63.100(k)(5) to subpart F and paragraph &sect;63.190(e)(4) to subpart I. The EPA expects that this compliance extension provision will be used only in those rare cases where, despite proper planning and scheduling by the owner or operator, the replacement seal or barrier fluid system is not available on time. The EPA expects that with the proposed revisions to the compliance date the vast majority of compressors will not need compliance extensions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In reevaluating the compliance period provided in the rule for compressors, the EPA also reconsidered whether it was appropriate to allow compliance extensions in cases where a process unit shutdown is necessary to permit installation of the replacement seal system or barrier fluid system. Typically, in a shutdown of a process unit with a compressor, the entire system is depressurized and the equipment is cleared of process fluids. Even with good air pollution control practices, such a process unit shutdown could involve substantially more emissions than if the compressor were allowed to operate with seals that do not meet the technical specifications of the standard. Whether delaying installation of replacement seals or barrier fluid systems is environmentally beneficial depends on the particular circumstances of each case as well as the length of the delay. Therefore, after evaluating the tradeoffs, the EPA concluded that compliance extensions until the next scheduled process unit shutdown should be allowed in certain circumstances. The EPA also judged that, based on estimates of the expected tradeoffs in emissions reduction, all compressors should be in compliance with the requirements of &sect;63.164 no later than April 22, 1996. These proposed changes to the compliance dates are presented in paragraph &sect;63.100(k)(5) of subpart F and &sect;63.190(e)(5). The EPA wants to emphasize that these proposed compliance extensions would be available only in cases where a process unit shutdown is necessary to allow installation of a new seal system or a new barrier fluid system or requires changes to the existing barrier fluid system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Proposed &sect;63.100(k)(8)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EPA is proposing to allow compliance extensions for processes that plan to eliminate the use or production of HAP from their process. Subpart I presently provides, in &sect;63.190(e), additional time for such process changes. The proposed new paragraph &sect;63.100(k)(8) would be added to subpart F to address an oversight in the drafting of the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Proposed Compliance Extension  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Elsewhere in today's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the EPA is announcing, pursuant to Clean Air Act section 307(d)(7)(B), reconsideration of the equipment leak provisions of the HON dealing with compressors and with surge control vessels and bottoms receivers (40 CFR 63.164, 63.170). In that action the EPA is also announcing a 3-month partial stay of those provisions during the reconsideration. However, the EPA may not be able to complete reconsideration of, and any appropriate curative regulatory action to, the rule within the 3-month period expressly provided by Clean Air Act section 307(d)(7)(B). If the EPA does not complete the reconsideration and rulemaking in this timeframe, then it will be necessary to temporarily extend the applicable compliance dates until the EPA completes final rulemaking action upon reconsideration. By this action the EPA proposes, pursuant to section 301(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7601(a)(1), a temporary extension of the compliance dates beyond the 3 months provided for Group I sources that had been required to comply with subpart H by October 24, 1994, and for sources required to comply as of January 23, 1995 or later, only as necessary to complete reconsideration and revision of the rule in question. As the EPA expects to be able to complete reconsideration of these regulatory provisions expeditiously, the EPA does not believe this temporary extension will, as a practical matter, affect the compliance dates for sources in Groups III, IV, or V since completion of the rulemaking is expected before April 24, 1995. If, following consideration of public comment, the EPA takes final action to extend these compliance dates, the dates would be extended until the effective date of the EPA's final action following reconsideration of these rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA is proposing this temporary extension of the compliance dates in order to complete reconsideration of the rule, as discussed above. The EPA intends to complete its reconsideration of the rule and, following the notice and comment procedures of section 307(d) of the Clean Air Act, take appropriate action as expeditiously as practicable. The EPA will seek to ensure that the affected parties are not unduly prejudiced by the EPA's reconsideration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

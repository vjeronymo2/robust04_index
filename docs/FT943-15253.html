			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Flashes of beauty mark Brazil's triumph - The three-time champions hold off an exciting Dutch fight-back Nobody will ever remember the first half of Brazil vs Holland in the World Cup quarter-finals in Dallas on Saturday. Few will ever forget the second. It went 1-0 and then 2-0 to Brazil, then 2-1 and 2-2 as the Dutch miraculously rallied, only for Branco, the mid-fielder, to step into an 80th minute free kick from 30 yards and bury it, conclusively, off de Goey's left-hand post. It was not only the goals. The second half saw soccer at its very best, with skill, passion and controversy of an order that deserves to be corked and bottled by the million cases, to be opened whenever the sport goes dull as a reminder of how it can be played. After the team's disappointing second-round performance against the US last Monday (Brazil won 1-0), many Brazilians feared a loss against Holland. And many still think Brazil are not playing as well as they should. Despite the team's unbeaten record, Brazilians sports writers had condemned what they called 'ugly and artless' soccer and manager Carlos Alberto Parreira was singled out for criticism. But on Saturday, Romario and Bebeto were the catalysts. The twin Brazilian strikers came out after half-time determined to take the match by the scruff of the neck - and did so. Twice in the first three minutes Romario went close, and after 51 minutes he put Brazil ahead. It was Bebeto, inevitably, who set it up, released at top speed by Dunga's through ball into the area. His left-foot cross was without flaw but, even so, bounced awkwardly for Romario - though not too awkwardly for a reflex right-foot half-volley from 10 yards that no goalkeeper could have touched. Brazil were rampant now, Bebeto hitting the post and Romario foiled by de Goey, running past Dutchmen as if they were lamp-posts. But it was Romario at a walk who was the vital ingredient in Bebeto's 61st-minute goal. Romario was strolling back, unconcerned and indisputably offside, from the Dutch area when Bebeto latched on to a headed ball from the Brazilian half, broke one tackle, rounded de Goey and tapped the ball home. The Dutch stood still, waiting for the flag against Romario, but, after consultation, the referee and linesman stuck to the new letter of the law - that the Brazilian had been 'passive' to the play in progress. Brazil then relaxed, almost fatally. Two minutes later, a throw-in from the left saw Bergkamp surviving one half-hearted challenge and beating Taffarel in the Brazilian goal from close range with a hard right-foot shot. Taffarel had lasted the equivalent of more than three matches without having to save a direct shot, but he was under the gun now, first from Jonk, then from Winter. Yet Taffarel seemed asleep in the 75th minute, rooted to his line as Winter rose to an Overmars corner and headed home the equaliser from no more than six yards. Now it was Brazil's turn to show mettle. Branco, in for Rai in mid-field, immediately unleashed a 35-yard range-finder that de Goey touched over. Satisfied, when the free kick came moments later - following the only foul that could be described as remotely dirty - he completed the scoring. That finally took some of the stuffing out of the Dutch. Manfully though they tried in the closing minutes, forcing some un-Brazilian punts into the crowd and unoccupied corners of the pitch, they created no more clear chances. But it was no disgrace to lose this one. There may have been moments when Romario and Bebeto ran five yards before their markers moved one foot, but the Dutch defence mostly compensated and covered. Koeman unleashed some thunderbolts, blocked by Brazilians who will know it on the morrow, and Bergkamp and Overmars showed that the Brazilian defence is far from invincible. Yet nobody has found a way to keep Romario and Bebeto quiet. A ball and chain might help.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "India Has More To Benefit From GATT Treaty"] </F>   [Text] New Delhi, Dec. 16. The following is the text of the  statement made by the Union Minister of Commerce, Mr. Pranab  Mukherjee, in Parliament today.    The Uruguay Round talks have been concluded last night and  an  overall agreement covering trade in goods, trade in services,  trade related intellectual property rights, trade related  investment measures, trade in textiles, and trade in  agricultural commodities has been crystalised for adoption and  ratification by the Governments of the 117 countries which have  been involved in the negotiations. As the Government has  clarified on more than one occasion, in both Houses of  Parliament, India has been a consistent supporter of an orderly  multilateral trading system. Such a system confers the benefits  of Most Favoured Nation (MFN) treatment to all members, benefits  of reduced tariffs and increased market access and the  protection of a Multilateral Dispute Settlement Mechanism.    It is expected that the successful conclusion of the Uruguay  Round will result in significant expansion in world trade as a  result of which India should be able to increase its own exports  by $1.5 billions to $2 billions annually in addition to the  normal growth. The reduction in export subsidies on agriculture  by developed countries will make Indian agricultural exports  more competitive in world markets. It may be mentioned that  despite their strong reservations regarding permitting the  import of rice, even countries like Japan and South Korea have  agreed to allow market access for rice to other exporting  countries. As I had informed the House in the course of my reply  to the discussion last week, taking the product and non-product  agricultural subsidies together, India's aggregate subsidy works  out to a substantial negative figure thereby providing a very  large scope for further augmentation of agricultural subsidies  if the Government were to choose to raise the subsidies from the  current levels. The proposed agreement provides for a subsidy  level of 10 per cent of the value of the agricultural produce  which is far higher than the current negative level of subsidy.  The agreement has also clarified that consumer subsidies under  the Public Distribution System for the rural and urban poor are  outside the scope of disciplines and our PDS system can thus be  continued without any difficulty.    While we would give reasonable protection to plant breeders  new develop how plant varieties under the Agreement, the rights  of farmers and researchers will also be fully protected. As I  have already clarified in the House, in the "sui generis"  legislation which is being drafted for this purpose, the  interests of our farmers will be safeguarded.    As stated by me earlier in the House, the agreement does not  place any explicit obligation to patent naturally occurring  genes and gene sequences. I am already on record that Government  do not intend to permit patenting of naturally occurring genes  and gene sequences in the patents legislation which would have  to be instituted in 10 years after coming into force of the  proposed agreement.    While India had initially not been in favour of inclusion of  Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights in the scope of the  Uruguay Round, it had ultimately to go along with the rest of  the world community. A country like ours, which does not  presently recognise product patents in the field of drugs, food  products and chemicals, has been allowed a transition period of  10 years for establishing a product patent regime for such  items. If we were to opt out of the new agreement, the  possibility of our major trading partners insisting upon a much  earlier introduction of product patents on the threat of  imposition of restrictions on the export of our goods into their  markets cannot be ruled out. Members may be aware that under  such pressure some developing countries very recently decided to  introduce an entirely new patent regime in accordance with the  wishes of some developed countries to safeguard their market  access to those countries. I had also clarified in the House  that the fears regarding an inordinate rise in the price of  patented drugs after the introduction of product patents are not  quite justified because under the agreement, the government  would be able to undertake compulsory licensing for  non-commercial public use as well as to prevent situations of  either inadequate availability or exorbitant pricing. Besides,  the Government retains the right to institute price control on  drugs.    As regards the agreement on Trade Related Investment  Measures, the position is that the Government retains its  sovereign right to decide what type of foreign investment it  wishes to allow into the country. Conditions can also be imposed  regarding fulfilment of export obligations to balance the outgo  and inflow of foreign exchange by such ventures. The only  requirement under the agreement is that once a unit has been  allowed to come into the country it will be treated at par with  other indigenous units in terms of regulations and policies.    As regards textiles, though we are unhappy with the  extension  of the quota regime by importing countries for another 10 years  and unsatisfactory annual rate of enhancement of the import  quotas, it has to be recognised that the commitment to finally  phase out the quota regime after 10 years is a positive gain for  textile exporting countries, including India. In the final hours  of the Round, an attempt was made by some industrialised  countries to alter the textile agreement of the draft final Act  to our disadvantage. The argument given was that India, while  benefiting from the open trading system and in spite of being  competitive in textiles, had kept its market closed. Forceful  suggestions were made that we should open our market also on a  reciprocal basis. We took the position that the multi-fibre  agreement was a derogation from GATT (General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade), and the integration of the Textiles trade  into GATT was not something that required any contribution from  us. We sustained our position in spite of concerted demands on  us. We also successfully resisted concerted moves to extend the  period of integration of textile trade from 10 to 15 years by  taking a strong position on the issue.    The Standing Committee attached to the Commerce Ministry,  which had gone into the implications of the Dunkel Draft in  great detail, has recommended in its report, that while all  efforts should be made to safeguard India's interests in key  sectors of agriculture, textiles, services and Intellectual  Property Rights, at the end of the day, India should remain a  part of a multilateral trading system rather than opting out the  same and getting totally isolated from the rest of the world.    On the whole it is our considered judgment that India has  more to benefit from the expansion of world trade through the  Uruguay Round Agreement rather than pursuing any alternative  course of action.</p>

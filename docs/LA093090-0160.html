			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNCIL GADFLY IS SENTENCED, GETS WARNING BY JUDGE;  </P> <P> CITY HALL: DANIEL ROSENBERG IS GIVEN THREE YEARS' PROBATION, ORDERED TO DO 100  HOURS OF COMMUNITY SERVICE FOR DISRUPTING MEETINGS.  </P> <P> A Municipal Court judge put gadfly Daniel Rosenberg on three years' probation  last week and ordered him to do 100 hours of community service for disrupting  the City Council.  </P> <P> Rosenberg, 61, was convicted last month of interrupting a March 20 meeting of  the City Council.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, Judge John S. Lane warned Rosenberg that he faced going to jail  if he violated his probation.  </P> <P> "If you misbehave and you come back to me, I want it distinctly understood that  I'm going to put you in jail," Lane said. "If you behave yourself, you have  nothing to fear."  </P> <P> Misbehaving, said Susan Melton, the assistant city prosecutor who handled the  case, means "if he does it again, and just doesn't shut up, and causes more  problems."  </P> <P> City officials -- who have taken to leaving the dais, rolling their eyes and  chatting during Rosenberg's many diatribes -- said they are pleased with the  sentence.  </P> <P> "I'd take it very seriously if I were him," said Mayor Ernie Kell, who has  sometimes switched off the microphone during Rosenberg's speeches. "We can't  have people like Mr. Rosenberg completely disrupting public meetings."  </P> <P> However, local activists feared that the sentence would intimidate others who  wish to speak out at public meetings. And they questioned spending $3,000 a day  for the three days it took to try the case -- a decision city prosecutor John  Vander Lans said was Rosenberg's. Rosenberg refused a pretrial offer that he  plead guilty in return for 40 hours of community work.  </P> <P> "The whole thing is ridiculous, when there are so many other kinds of pressing  needs and issues," said Alan Lowenthal, president of Long Beach Area Citizens  Involved.  </P> <P> Lowenthal said he felt "sorry" for Rosenberg.  </P> <P> But if Rosenberg is intimidated, he did not show it at Wednesday's sentencing.  Instead of the formal suit he had worn to his trial, he sported a pair of jeans  and a worn denim shirt. Embroidered on the shirt were a rainbow, a sun and a  gull, which he said represented "freedom and love."  </P> <P> Rosenberg's manner was also dramatically different from the oddly timid way in  which he comported himself at his trial last month, when his attorney, Jay  Glaser, argued that Rosenberg was a "man with a mission to help" the poor and  weak.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, Rosenberg was his old scrappy self. He read a defiant seven-page,  handwritten speech saying, in part: "This is one of my proudest days in my  life. I'm disliked and perhaps even feared and hated."  </P> <P> Rosenberg said battling a "corrupt political machine" is what has caused his  lack of popularity.  </P> <P> And he vowed to keep fighting: "We will not remain silent."  </P> <P> Rosenberg filed an appeal immediately after the sentencing.  </P> <P> Rosenberg recently put a message on his answering machine asking for donations  to what he called the Long Beach Legal Defense Club.  </P> <P> "Slap back," he says on the machine. "Help disrupt the corrupt. Vote with your  dollar. We need your help."  </P></p>

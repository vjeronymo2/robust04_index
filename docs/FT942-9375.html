			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Equity Markets: Other markets STOCKHOLM Astra's first-quarter figures come out tomorrow. Analysts are looking for sales of SKr6bn, a rise of some 20 per cent, with sales of Losec up 30 per cent to almost SKr2bn, and Pulmicort sales up 35 per cent to SKr870m. Hoare Govett says pre-tax profit in the first quarter of 1993 was very positively affected by a large translational benefit. 'Consequently, although operating profit is expected to increase by more than 35 per cent, on a comparable basis, pre-tax profit is only expected to increase by 15 per cent to SKr2bn. For all 1994, sales are expected to reach SKr27.2bn, with pre-tax profit of SKr9.45bn and earnings per share of SKr11.4.' MADRID Telefonica's first-quarter figures are due out today. UBS global research says that while quarter-on-quarter results are particularly difficult to forecast, they expect a 4.7 per cent rise to Pta14.7bn in net income for the parent company. 'A better measure of performance may be cash earnings: we are forecasting first-quarter cash earnings of Pta118.7bn, up 9.2 per cent.' AMSTERDAM KNP BT, the paper and graphic supplies group, announces first-quarter results on Wednesday. The group has already reported at its recent annual meeting net profits of around Fl 50m, compared with a loss in the same period last year. Hoare Govett notes that the recovery is broadly based, 'with all divisions showing better results. Demand volumes, as well as prices for paper and packaging products, have recovered from low 1993 levels and sales volumes in the trading divisions (paper merchanting/office products and graphic information systems) are also expected to show improvements this year. Restructuring programmes will improve results in all divisions. Our current earnings per estimates are: 1994, Fl 1.60 and 1993, Fl 4.20.' TOKYO Share fluctuations this week will be affected by the currency movements and the strength on US stock and bond markets. Hopes of a US credit tightening helped the dollar against the yen last week, and further stabilisation of the currency markets, which will largely depend on US interest rates, is expected to encourage investors. Meanwhile, many investors are likely to remain inactive due to the spate of corporate results, which may cause some volatility.</p>

			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Abu Dhabi lifts gas exports Abu Dhabi, the biggest oil producer in the United Arab Emirates, yesterday agreed to double its gas exports to Japan, Reuter reports from Dubai. The Abu Dhabi Gas Liquefaction Company signed an agreement with Tokyo Electric Power to export 5m tonnes of liquefied natural gas a year over the next 25 years. Adgas said the signing in Abu Dhabi formalised a 1990 accord between the two companies. The exports will begin in 1994, when expansion of Abu Dhabi's liquefied gas plant on Das Island is completed.</p>

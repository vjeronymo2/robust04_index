			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Interior Minister Carlos Podesta said yesterday:  "Those responsible for kidnapping IBR [Agrarian Reform  Institute] technicians will be brought to trial to answer for  their crime. The government will not hesitate to resort to the  law," He thus referred to peasant leaders who held a group of  IBR technicians hostage in the settlement of General Resquin on  7 April [date as published]. [passage omitted]    Asked if the situation will interrupt the negotiations  currently underway between the government and peasants, Podesta  said: "The peasant leaders siting at the negotiating table with  the government cannot be held responsible for what other  peasants do on their own."    Asked about the announcement that peasants will again close  roads, the minister said: "The police will enforce the law. If  there is a court order we will use force, without doubt."    Returning to the issue of the General Resquin "kidnappers,"  Podesta said: "Those responsible have names and we will press  charges against them, without doubt." [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Shunji Taoka, AERA editorial staff member: "No </F> U.S. Military Presence Seen In the 21st Century As Tension  Mitigates"]    [Text] National security policy planners are required to  foresee what is ahead in the next l0 years or more -- if  possible 30 years -- and at the same time, to review the past  and present situation.    If the upcoming national defense buildup program is going to  cover a five-year period as it has previously, it will cover the  period from fiscal year 1996 to 2000.    Warships, aircraft, and the like requisitioned under the  program are to be made ready, and the reorganization of units is  to be completed sometime around 2005. This equipment will be  deployed and used at the first-line until 2025 or 2030.    Planning a security program from the viewpoint of today's  situation will render the future policy completely inadequate.    Although it is impossible to correctly predict the world and  domestic situation or the development of scientific technology,  a challenge must be made to guarantee security.    Today's utmost concern is the DPRK's suspected nuclear arms  development program and its stalled economy, but it is highly  likely these issues will be settled by the early part of the  next century.  A Reduction of U.S. Forces in Japan Is Possible [subhead]    In May, the 21st Century Committee, an advisory organ of ROK  President Kim Yong-sam, submitted a report entitled: "The  Republic of Korea in the 21st Century," predicting "the high  possibility of the DPRK's economic collapse within three to five  years, and Korean unification by 2020."    Last year, the DPRK was presumed to have produced 3,880,000  tons of grain, comprising 60 percent of the 6,500,000 tons it  actually needed; the lack of foreign exchange reserves prevented  it from importing foodstuffs. If this situation continues, the  North Korean economy will not last long.    Meanwhile, if the DPRK adopts an open-door policy in order  to  attract foreign investment, the foundation of the Worker's  Party-controlled DPRK regime -- which has shut off information  from foreign countries and given its people falsified reports of  the poverty-ridden ROK -- will be shaken. The report's contents  are thus considered timely.    Russia's armed forces have experienced considerable  hollowing  out in the Far East, with less and less requisitioning of new  arms and equipment. There are even insufficient personnel funds  to pay wages -- because of the late payment and non-payments of  officers' wages, their wives and children held a demonstration  in Sakhalin. It will require decades for Russia to regain its  status as a military power.    The modernization program of the Chinese armed forces is  progressing at a far slower pace than those of Japan, the ROK,  and Taiwan (Republic of China). The United States, which  informed the world of "China bending toward expanded armaments,"  has completely reversed its position from that of last year.    The U.S. Department of Defense approached China for a  "U.S.-Chinese military exchange," to see if the United States  can sell its weaponry to China. However, the Chinese Government  seems to be in no position to allow rapid modernization of its  armed forces, because of perennial huge budget deficits since  1986. Nominal increases in the publicly announced defense  budget are huge but are paralleled by the inflation rate.    When the Korean peninsula is united, a drastic reduction in  U.S. Armed Forces in Japan will be possible. This is especially  true of the U.S. Third Marine Division which maintains a large  complex of facilities on Okinawa. Originally, the division was  intended for landing operations in the case of contingencies on  the Korean peninsula, and was on the verge of dissolution last  year in former Defense Secretary Les Aspin's plan [sentence as  published]. But it has survived temporarily because of tensions  revolving around the DPRK's suspected nuclear arms development  program.    The 12th Marine Air Group at Iwakuni, with about 60 aircraft  comprised of FA-18 Hornet fighter bombers and AV-8 Harriers,  will become defunct when the Third Marine Division is dissolved  as it supports the Marines.  <H5>  The U.S. Is Going Allout To Stop Financial Deterioration </H5>   The 18th Air Wing with 54 F-15 Eagle fighter-bombers at  Kadena Airbase on Okinawa is ready to send reinforcement to the  ROK. Even now several Eagles are being dispatched to Osan  Airbase. This unit will become obsolete.    The landing crafts at Sasebo are for the transport of the  Third Marine Division and they can be reduced. The old-type  aircraft carrier Independence and its escort ships at Yokosuka  need not remain in Japan. The carrier may be destined for  retirement from service. The 432d Air Wing with 48 F-16  Fighting Falcons at Misawa Airbase, Aomori Prefecture, will lose  its reason for being there as the United States and Russia are  now partners, and if the Korean peninsula is unified.    The colossal U.S. financial deficit has no prospects of  being  reduced, and the danger of the dollar's collapse in value  constitutes the biggest factor in world instability.    The United States is compelled to make its prime objective  preventing the financial deficit from deteriorating further, in  order to protect its economic order and that of the world.    Even if the Japan-U.S. security system remains effective in  the 21st century, it will become something close to an "alliance  without U.S. military presence." Historically speaking, that is  an ordinary form of alliance.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Joe Clark, the UN secretary </F> general's special representative in Cyprus, by unidentified  Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation correspondent; place and date  not given -- Clark speaks in English]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Announcer] Joe Clark, the UN  secretary general's special representative in Cyprus, believes  that both President Glavkos Kliridhis and Turkish Cypriot leader  Rauf Denktas will attend the talks with goodwill.    [Clark] I believe there is goodwill on both sides. Obviously  there are going to be questions, obviously people come at this  from different perspectives, but I think there is recognition  that the international community has been working hard to help  the people of Cyprus come to an agreement on these measures.    The other thing that, of course, is clear is that this is  not  at all the end of the process. We have to build confidence in  order to get on to deal with some of the basic questions that  have divided the island. And I don't regard the  confidence-building measures as being an end unto themselves,  but I certainly do regard them as being an important key to the  door that will let us deal with the more basic questions.    [Announcer] Asked what one could expect in the best  scenario,  Clark said he hopes the UN secretary will be able to state in  his report to the UN Security Council that there has been  progress. It would be ideal, he added, if he could mention that  an agreement has been reached to implement the measures. But,  it would be unrealistic to expect this to happen in nine or ten  days.    [Clark] Certainly, however, I think its going to be  critically important that there be agreement on the way we give  effect to these measures and that we start giving the effect, I  would hope by at least the end of March. That means we have to  make real progress in the next couple of days.    [Announcer] How and why is Joe Clark optimistic?    [Clark] I am certainly more optimistic now than I was two or  three weeks ago because there has been important movement, I  think on two issues. One, a clear statement of principle in  support of the proposal by each side and, secondly, an agreement  on the way we should proceed. Now, we have to get down to the  details as to what we do to give effect to these measures and if  we agree on that, as I think it is possible we can, we then get  on to the more basic question.</p>

			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Merseyside faces creditors' action Merseyside Development Corporation, a government agency, faces legal action by creditors over the opera concert to celebrate the visit of the Columbus Grand Regatta tall ships to Liverpool and Birkenhead in 1992. Only about Pounds 10,000 of assets remain in Carroll Promotions, the failed company set up with a share capital of Pounds 2 by Mr Brendan Carroll, the corporation's public relations consultant, to run the concert. Mr Sandy Jack of Parkin S. Booth, the liquidator, yesterday told creditors he would not apply for a winding-up order until the Commons public accounts committee has published its report. Creditors include the corporation, which had to inject more than Pounds 400,000 to save the concert after poor ticket sales. Smaller creditors say they believed the event was in effect sponsored and underwritten by the corporation, which should therefore be held responsible for all the debts. Mr Nicholas Corke, owner-manager of Freehand Design, who represents himself and 13 other creditors, said yesterday: 'We believe we have a fair chance of proving the relationship between the corporation and Carroll Promotions was that of principal and agent, so the corporation would then be liable to pay us.' A contract putting Carroll Promotions at a legal arm's length from the corporation was signed only days before the concert, when it was already clear there would be substantial losses. Mr Corke said a loss of Pounds 187,000 was already projected in a budget attached to the contract. He said the contract was only supposed to operate if they event went into profit. The National Audit Office, the public spending watchdog, said in a critical report in April that eventual losses would be about Pounds 695,000.</p>

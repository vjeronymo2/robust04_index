It's known the great amount of kerosene is in the Batumi  port  and it's impossible to deliver it to Armenia because of the  situation at the Georgian roads.    So, Azerbaijan has an additional chance to earn using the  situation.    According to the data SNARK News Agency possesses, the price  for the Azerbaijani kerosene is in 1.5 times more than the price  for the fuel which could be brought by planes from Russia and in  2 times more than the Irani kerosene price. Azerbaijani could  use the acquired currency to go on with the military actions in  Karabakh, so, can this way be considered as the accepted one.  Besides, such deliveries are the violations of the "Freedom  Defense Law", accepted by the USA Congress which prohibits the  USA Government to finance Azerbaijan because of the blockade  course he accepted in respect to Armenia and Karabakh.</p>

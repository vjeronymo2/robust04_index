			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Passages within quotation marks are recorded] </F>   [Excerpt] The conference on the Nation and the Emigre  Community began this morning at the Convention Center with an  opening address by Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina. There are  200 emigre community representatives in attendance from  approximately 40 countries. In addition to Robaina, the  conference is also being chaired by Carlos Lage, secretary of  the Council of Ministers; Ricardo Alarcon, president of the  National Assembly of the People's Government; Abel Prieto,  president of the National Union of Cuban Writers and Artists;  and Sergio Corrieri, president of the Cuban Institute of  Friendship with Peoples. Conference spokesman Miguel Alfonso and  secretary Jose Cabanas are present.    For those familiar with three decades of pressures, threats,  and aggressions, it is easy to understand the personal effort of  many and the merit of your decision to not sell out to those who  exerted pressures and threats to prevent this meeting: These  were the exact words of Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina during  a welcoming address to the conference participants on behalf of  the Cuban Government.    In his address, Robaina stated that the presence in Havana  of  Cubans who live abroad is an indication of support and  identification with the Cuban nation as well as a recognition of  our government's valor in convening this conference in the midst  of the pressing and urgent tasks Cuba faces today.    [Robaina] "You have arrived in Cuba in the midst of an  exceptional period, when our people are making extraordinary  efforts to heroically preserve the fatherland's independence and  sovereignty, and the gigantic accomplishments of the Revolution.  If we commit to this conference, it is because the subject  deserves to see the beginning of a joint discussion aimed at  making progress along the road to normalize ties between the  nation and its emigre community."    The conference is taking place under the same conditions of  abnormality, of a U.S. policy of hostility toward Cuba, which  since the triumph of the Revolution have shaped the ties with  the emigre community.    [Robaina] "The fact that we are here today in this room is  not even remotely the result of a miracle or accident. It is  above all the result of our maturity, strength, and  independence, and also the result of a growing attitude of  respect and understanding of a significant portion of the emigre  community who identifies more each day with the vital interests  of Cuba."

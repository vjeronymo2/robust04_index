			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Renault's UK truck side incurs Pounds 18.6m deficit RENAULT TRUCK Industries, the UK subsidiary of Renault Vehicules Industriels, the French commercial vehicle maker, suffered an Pounds 18.6m pre-tax loss last year following losses of Pounds 20.8m in 1990 and Pounds 21.1m in 1989. The scale of the losses, coupled with the absence of new orders to replace a large volume military truck contract which will be completed at the end of the month, is forcing Renault to review the future of its truck assembly operations in the UK. In the short-term the ending of the contract is expected to lead to further job losses at the Dunstable plant. The workforce, excluding truck dealerships, has already been almost halved during the recession to 552 from 1,070 at the end of 1989. RVI has been forced to inject Pounds 20m in new equity to bolster the battered finances of RTI, which has incurred losses for the past decade. The latest financial restructuring follows the provision by RVI of Pounds 20.4m of additional working capital for its UK truck subsidiary in 1990, the injection of Pounds 14.2m of extra working capital and a Pounds 15m loan in 1989. RTI's turnover fell by 10 per cent last year from Pounds 71.9m to Pounds 64.8m. Renault warned previously that it could end truck assembly in the UK, but the Dunstable plant was granted at least a temporary reprieve in mid-1990, when it won - along with Reynolds Boughton - a Pounds 20m contract to supply 846 four-wheel drive trucks to the Ministry of Defence. The contract has accounted for close to 30 per cent of RTI's output in the last two years. The MoD has not exercised its option to purchase an additional 160 vehicles, and RTI hopes that the initial contract would lead to significant export orders have failed to materialise. Renault took over the former Chrysler-owned Dodge truck operations in Dunstable in 1981. It currently assembles two vehicle ranges - the 50 series light truck, which it inherited from Dodge, and the Renault Midliner light/medium truck. Output fell last year by 24 per cent to 915 vehicles.</p>

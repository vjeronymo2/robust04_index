			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Antonin Baudys by Jan </F> Stetka; place and date not given: "Perhaps We Will Welcome NATO  Troops to the Czech Republic"]    [Text] We asked Defense Minister Antonin Baudys some  questions in connection with the discussion on the Czech  Republic's attitude toward the Visegrad Group countries.    [Stetka] Following President Clinton's visit to Prague, how  do you view the possibilities for military cooperation among the  Visegrad countries?    [Baudys] The Visegrad grouping is -- from our point of view  -- obsolete. Bulgaria, Romania, and the Baltic states are  applying for membership of NATO; perhaps even Slovenia will join  them. These countries are asking justifiably, why Visegrad and  not us? Close military cooperation among the Visegrad countries  narrows down the issue unacceptably. Partnership for Peace is  an individual plan, and, therefore, an absolutely correct one.  On the other hand, the Czech Republic is the most active  propagator of economic cooperation in Central Europe. In my  opinion, associating entry into NATO with military cooperation  among the Visegrad countries is nonsense.    [Stetka] What do you think of Poland's reservations about  alleged Czech individualism?    [Baudys] I understand President Walesa, because his country  borders directly on Belarus and the Kaliningrad Oblast, where  there is a large concentration of Russian troops. The question  is, of course, whether all the members of the Polish cabinet  share Walesa's views.    [Stetka] Do you know anything specific yet about Czech  participation in Partnership for Peace?    [Baudys] Naturally, we have an idea, because we were  consulted on the project in advance. We are planning a  six-month course for the military experts who will represent us  in NATO headquarters. Last year, we planned joint exercises  involving Czech units and a French company and now, within the  framework of the Partnership, we are also planning exercises  with the Dutch. They will be held this year. It is possible  that they will be held in our country.</p>

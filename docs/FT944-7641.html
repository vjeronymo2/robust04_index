			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Strike-hit Iberia turns to Plan B Iberia, Spain's financially crippled national carrier, faced a major industrial dispute yesterday as its management announced after a board meeting that it would shed 5,200 jobs from its 25,000 labour force and drastically reduce the size of the airline. Unions, which had rejected an earlier management plan to cut salaries by an average 15 per cent, said they would blockade Spain's airports in protest at the management's plans. As the confrontation at Iberia began to look ominously like the violent industrial dispute at Air France a year ago, the company's employees began holding mass meetings at Madrid's Barajas airport and at other domestic airports last night. With tension running high, one union spokesman said: 'We are not preparing strikes, we are getting together to plan the closedown of air traffic in Spain.' Mr Javier Salas, chairman of Iberia, and president of INI, the state holding group that owns the airline, said the company would hive off some of its key units under a series of emergency measures that Iberia's board has called Plan B. The proposed measures effectively mean that Iberia renounces its ambitions to be a global carrier and scales down to become a regional airline. Plan B involves the sale of Iberia's subsidiaries to INI for subsequent disposal. Iberia would hive off its shareholdings in a string of airlines including Aerolineas Argentinas, Chile's Ladeco, Venezuela's Viasa and the domestic carriers Aviaco, Binter Canarias and Binter Mediterraneo. The measures involve the segregation of the company's handling, maintenance, information systems and marketing units and their eventual sale. Iberia, after such a break-up, would consist of a reduced aircraft fleet and a staff of around 5,000, mostly pilots and cabin crews. Mr Salas said the survival of Iberia in its present form would only be possible if the earlier viability plan, which involved pay cuts and the loss of 2,000 jobs, was accepted by the unions. Unions have already staged two 24-hour stoppages this month that grounded 75 per cent of Iberia's flights in protest at the pay cuts. Economy minister Mr Solbes said yesterday that if the airline's management failed to gain union consent to its original viability plan it would have full government backing to take other measures because 'there is no other alternative.' Under the terms of the viability plan, Iberia would also have sought authorisation for public subsidies totalling Pta130bn (Pounds 640m) from the European Commission. This request however depended on union agreement to the pay cuts. Under Plan B, the management shelves the recapitalisation plan and will instead meet the urgent need for fresh funding by breaking up the company and scaling down the airline to a fraction of its present size. Iberia is expected to lose Pta44bn this year, up on earlier estimates of Pta30bn, and its accumulated losses by December will have effectively wiped out a Pta120bn capital injection that was authorised by Brussels in 1992. Mr Salas has said there is a 'serious risk' that the company could be 'legally bankrupt and forced into liquidation' early next year.</p>

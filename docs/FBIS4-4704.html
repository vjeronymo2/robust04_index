			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta, Apr 5 (ANTARA) -- Visiting Dutch Prime  Minister Ruud Lubbers said that relations between Indonesia and  the Netherlands, almost two years after a dispute leading to the  break up of the Inter Governmental Group for Indonesian (IGGI),  were now very mature.    "The relations are even better than in the past. It is  really an advantage for we have now a mature relations in the  economic field as well as in the political field," he told  ANTARA in a special interview here on Tuesday.    The prime minister, who had just had a tete-a-tete with  President Suharto, said that such a development had resulted in  the increase of investment and trade volume between both  countries.    Stating that the Netherlands is in the forefront of free  trade and is now increasing international trade ties, he said  that there is an excellent possibilities of Indonesia and his  country to go on further in that part.    Indonesia and the Netherlands went through a disruption in  their ties following Indonesia's decision to stop accepting all  aid originating from the Netherlands to protest the interference  of the Hague in Jakarta's domestic matters in 1992.    The cut of the Dutch aid also signalled the end of the  Dutch-led IGGI international aid consortium.    IGGI was then replaced by the Paris based Consultative Group  on Indonesia (CGI).    Some analysts believe that Prime Minister Lubber's visit to  Indonesia marks a significant improvement in the  Netherlands-Indonesia ties since 1992.    On the occasion, Lubbers also underlined that the two  countries have given more emphasis on business aspects, saying  that the Netherlands always take a close watch on Indonesia's  rapid development.    "Your country is now in the start of the take-off era  situation. In response to the situation, we will be very happy  to participate in such a development," he added.    When addressing an Indonesia-Netherlands Association (INA)  lunch on the same day, the prime minister said that Jakarta and  the Hague hold regular economic consultations at a bilateral  level as well as in multilateral fora.    He said that differences of opinion, when they occur, are  discussed openly, frankly, and with determination on both sides  to ultimately arrive at a solution that takes into account the  mutual benefit of both, as partners and old friends should.    He said that trade relation between the two countries are  expanding and have been, for some time now, to Indonesia's  advantage.    In 1992, the Netherlands imported approximately 1,260  million  Dutch guilders worth of Indonesian goods, while export to  Indonesia amounted to 730 million Dutch guilders.    In the first quarter of 1993, exports from the Netherlands  to  Indonesia rose by 31 percent, as compared with the same period  the year before, while imports from Indonesia increased by 28  percent.    In 1993, over 100,000 Dutch tourists visited Indonesia, an  increase by more than 50 percent compared with that of in 1988.    Prime Minister Lubbers arrived in Jakarta on Monday for a  four- day visit.</p>

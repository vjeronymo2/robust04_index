			<p>BFN     [Text] Salta, May 22 (NA) -- Raul Granillo Ocampo,  Argentine ambassador to the United States, said that he supports  the approval of a patents law, adding that "all countries, and  not only Argentina, agree that it is advisable to recognize the  intellectual rights of researchers."    Granillo said: "This is accepted even by the association  organized to defend national laboratories. Besides, it is not an  Argentine commitment with the United States alone, it is a  commitment with the entire international community."    The ambassador recalled that Argentina "and another 106  countries signed the GATT agreement," which "obligates"  Argentina "to approve a law recognizing patent rights."    "The real problem will be if Argentina wants to join NAFTA,  because the requirements here are much tougher and anyone  wanting to join in must respect the local rules of the game,"  Granillo Ocampo said, during an interview with the daily EL  TRIBUNO from this provincial capital.    Granillo Ocampo said Argentina "will try to balance what we  and others must give up," adding that "we must not be afraid of  this type of conflict, as on most other topics we are working in  absolute harmony, together and in agreement."    The Argentine ambassador said "it was vital" for Argentina  to  join NAFTA "to consolidate the model," because "when a country  coordinates its macroeconomic polices with other countries, the  rules of the game are consolidated and stabilized."    Regarding Argentina's trade deficit with the United States,  Granillo Ocampo said the situation was not dramatic, as the  deficit is the result "of an important increase in imports in  capital goods used in the incorporation of new technologies."    "Argentina let a lot of time go by without investing in  technology. The deficit ended up producing a very large hole,  which condemned the country to suffer a loss of competitiveness  and trade deficits," Granillo Ocampo said.    The ambassador dismissed the possibility of creating a  common  front with Australia and the United States on agriculture  subsidies, adding that "we are negotiating only because we must  face a situation that hurts us all."    Regarding the purchase of planes equipped with radar, the  ambassador said the country "got the planes it was looking for."    Asked about the possible sale of Pampa planes to the United  States, Granillo Ocampo said: "Price conditions established in  the offer will determine whether we can go ahead with the deal."</p>

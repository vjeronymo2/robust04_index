			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Forte weak News that Forte faces even stiffer competition than first reported for its management deal with Ciga, the loss-making Italian hotelier, came in stark contrast to the recent rush of good news which has underpinned the solid performance in the group's shares. Forte announced the proposed tie-up last month, paying Pounds 33m cash and inserting some of its own luxury hotels with a value of about Pounds 125m into an Italian operating company. Although the deal is currently undergoing due diligence, Hyatt Hotels was recently reported by industry sources to be considering a late bid, and yesterday came reports that two other US groups, Marriott and Sheraton, were also in contention. The shares, off 3 at 234p, are now believed by some leisure specialists to be fully priced. Banks suffered heavy selling, with dealers talking of a big sell note expected this week, and saying US holders of the sector were also aggressive sellers. Barclays dropped 14 to 561p, as did National Westminster, to 542p, while HSBC, also upset by the weakness of the Hong Kong market, lost 13 to 725p. Lloyds fell 16 to 564p. Abbey National, thought to be about to issue a statement on trading prospects for the second half, dipped 6 to 403p. Independent Insurance, the first composite insurer to obtain a listing since the Second World War, performed exceptionally well on its debut. Offered and placed at 225p a share, the stock price opened at 263p before easing back to eventually settle at 255p. Widespread market weakness hit the big composites. Guardian Royal Exchange closed 8 off at 194p, while Royal Insurance lost 13 to 283p. General Accident gave up the same amount to 648p. Revived speculation that the Kuwait Investment Office may be preparing the way for the sale of its 9.9 per cent stake in BP - well in excess of 540m shares and worth around Pounds 1.85bn - together with nervousness ahead of today's Opec meeting in Vienna, unsettled the shares and undermined the rest of the oil sector. The market's initial reaction to the KIO story was to mark BP shares down to 335p. Once the early uncertainty had passed, however, the stock price began to rally, closing the session 2 easier at 339p after turnover of 9.9m. Shell Transport dipped 6 to 681p and Enterprise lost 8 to 448p. Utilities were among the best performing areas of the market as the prospect of a series of big dividend increases later this week from companies such as PowerGen, Scottish Power and South West Water cushioned share prices from the effects of the general sell-off in European stock markets. Waters, recs and power generators invariably attract substantial investment from funds switching out of the highly geared Footsie stocks into the high yielding and defensive sectors. PowerGen is the first of the three utilities sector stocks to announce interim figures this week. The recs provided the biggest risers, with Seeboard 6 firmer at 651p, and South West and Norweb up 4 each at 609p and 658p. PowerGen, still feeling the effects of a NatWest recommendation to switch from the stock to National Power, to take advantage of an overly large price differential between the two stocks, fell 8 to 462p. Scottish Power eased 3 to 408p. At the start of an intriguing week of results from food manufacturers, the sector held up well in the weak market, although dealers said turnover was thin. NatWest Securities became the latest broker to turn more positive on the buffeted sector, believing the recent underperformance overdone. NatWest said cyclical recovery and yield considerations make the case for shifting from an 'underperform' to 'neutral' stance. Among the three companies reporting this week, Northern Foods stayed at 229p and Hazlewood Foods slipped a penny to 160p, as did Tate &amp; Lyle to 389p. News of the break-down of the Alcazar European airline consortium boosted sentiment in British Airways and the shares stayed firm at 409p. Reports of an electrical fault at Eurotunnel added to the shares' slide, 13 off at 433p. Losses and provisions at engineering group Babcock knocked the shares, which finished 2 1/2 down at 26 1/4 p. Press reports that BMW is interested in buying Rover - with a price tag of Pounds 1bn being mooted - lifted British Aerospace. The shares hardened a penny to 424p. Tomkins, 6 cheaper at 226p, was weakened by a downgrade, said by dealers to have come from NatWest Securities. Specialty chemicals group Holliday Chemical Holdings plunged 51 to 174p on a profits warning. Publishing group EMAP bucked the trend and rose 10 to 355p after posting increased first-half profits and saying it detected signs of a market upturn. United Newspapers put on 7 at 529p on weekend press stories that the group was discussing a merger with the Irish Independent group. Theme park operator Euro Disney was again under pressure as French press reports that some banks were trying to offload some of their debts in the group at a hefty discount hit the market. The shares rallied from the day's low to close 13 off at 402p. BT relinquished 7 to 462 1/2 p, matching the decline in the FT-SE 100, with JP Morgan, the US investment bank, said to have taken the stock off its buy list. Vodafone eased 4 to 520p: dealers are expecting a near 17 per cent increase in the interim, due this morning.</p>

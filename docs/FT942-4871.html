			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Russian-Ukraine tensions ease Tensions between Ukraine and its Russian dominated region of Crimea eased further yesterday when Kiev announced it would pursue a policy of flexible deadlines in response to Crimea's diplomatic concessions last weekend. Head of the Ukrainian negotiating team, Mr Volodymyr Bthutkevich, said that any actions against Crimea's pro-Russian leadership would be postponed until June 15, a date which could further delayed if negotiations continue to proceed productively. The initial breakthrough was achieved late Friday night when Crimean negotiators, many of whom have advocated independence from Ukraine and reunification with Russia in the past, surprisingly backed down and signed a pro-Ukrainian communique. In the communique, Crimea recognizes 'the territorial integrity of Ukraine, of which Crimea is a part' and 'the supremacy of the Ukrainian Constitution over all Ukrainian territory.' The two sides, meeting on the Crimean peninsula, also decided to form a permanent joint working group to resolve their legislative differences.</p>

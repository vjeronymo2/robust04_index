			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Leonid Kostrov report in the "Geography" column: "`Closed' </F> Cities Will Appear On The Maps"]    [Text] Work is under way in the production association  Kartographiya on preparing new maps which for the first time  will feature some of the populated areas earlier considered  secret, under new names designated by the Russian government.  Thus, Krasnoyarsk- 26 will become Zheleznogorsk;  Krasnoyarsk-45, Zelenogorsk; Shkotovo-17 in Maritime Kray has  received the name of Fokino; Svobodnyy-18 in Amur Oblast, where  in place of a strategic missile force division a space center is  being set up, has been called Uglegorsk. Kapustin Yar-1 has  become Znamenskiy; Arzamas-16 has been named Kremlev; Penza-19,  Zarechnyy; Perm-76, Zvezdnyy; Sverdlovsk-44, Norouralsk; and  Tomsk-7, Seversk.    Overall, 38 hitherto secret cities figure in the government  document, On the Official Geographic Names of Populated Areas  Located in Closed Administrative-Territorial Formations. The  secret installations and associated technology in these cities  have of course remained but geographic names have nothing to do  with this. It is another question to what extent the new names  correspond to toponomy: If anything, there are plenty of  "ugle-zhelezhno-zeleno-" derivatives in the names of Russian  cities already.    As Yakov Topchiyan, Kartographiya's chief editor, told  SEGODNYA's correspondent, the formerly secret cities will be  shown primarily on maps of scale 1:100,000 and 1:200,000. So  far maps of this scale are marked "for official use only." They  will also appear on generally available maps, for instance, maps  of federation components in particular, Amur Oblast and Maritime  and Khabarovsk Kray. Some of the 38 cities will also be  indicated in the soon to be published Atlas of Russia's  Automobile Roads.</p>

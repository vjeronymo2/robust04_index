During the course of talks on problems of a Bosnian  settlement at the Russian Foreign Ministry, Karadzic spoke about  the Bosnian Serbs' consent to the opening in the near future of  the airport at Tuzla under the control of and with the  participation of international observers in order to supply  humanitarian cargoes to the town. At the same time, Karadzic  noted, the Bosnian Serbs proceed from the fact that Russian  observers will be taking part in controlling the non-military  use of the airport.    Also examined in Moscow were questions of the implementation  of the Russian president's initiative on holding a summit  meeting in the Russian capital with the purpose of arriving as  quickly as possible at an agreement on peace, an all-embracing  settlement to the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the lifting  of sanctions against the FRY.

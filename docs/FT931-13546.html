			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Move for council tax to be in RPI THE COUNCIL TAX and package holidays abroad should be included in the retail prices index, the main measure of inflation, an advisory committee told the government yesterday. The retail prices advisory committee said the council tax should be included in the RPI from April to replace the community charge, or poll tax, in the index. Package holidays, which so far have not figured in the RPI, should be included from the beginning of this year. One committee member - Mr Samuel Brittan, chief economic commentator of the Financial Times - dissented from the recommendation on the council tax, arguing that it was a direct tax and therefore should not be included in a measure of inflation. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said he would announce his response to the recommendations 'in due course'.</p>

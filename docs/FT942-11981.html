			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Retail investors shun biotech trust launch Retail investors have largely spurned the opportunity to acquire shares in International Biotechnology Trust, recently launched by Rothschild Asset Management. They have applied for 2.67m shares (with warrants) out of about 25m on offer in the public offer for subscriptions, which closed on April 29. The disappointing level of applications reflects, and follows hard on the heels of, the applications by institutional and other investors. Here, some Pounds 35.1m was raised - less than half the targeted amount. The public element represented about one quarter of the Pounds 100m that RAM and Robert Fleming, the sponsor, had originally hoped to raise from the trust's launch. In total only Pounds 37.7m was raised. However, Mr Jeremy Curnock Cook, a RAM director and leader of the advisory team, remained bullish, saying: 'Against a background of difficult market conditions, the total sum raised . . . is satisfactory for a specialist fund . . . and I am confident our timing is excellent.' The trust is to focus on the flurry of recently floated biotech companies, most of which are trading at a discount to their issue price.</p>

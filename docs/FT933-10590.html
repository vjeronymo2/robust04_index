			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / International Company News: Airport contract awarded ASEA Brown Boveri, the Swedish-Swiss energy and engineering group, and Deutsche Babcock, the German engineering company, have won a DM730m (Dollars 429.4m) contract from the Greek government to supply equipment for the new Spata airport on the outskirts of Athens. ABB's German-based Schaltanlage and Leitungsbau subsidiaries, which manufacture switch gears and energy wires, will provide electrical equipment worth DM410m for the airport's terminals and for the runway lighting systems. Krantz TKT, a subsidiary of Balcke-Durr, owned by Deutsche Babcock, is expected to provide most of the remaining electrical equipment. Infrastructure at the Spata airport will be built by Hochtief. The whole project is estimated to be worth around DM4bn. The Greek government wants to create a Sparta airport company to handle the development and the operations of the airport. The airport, due for completion in 1998, will have a capacity of 16m passengers a year.</p>

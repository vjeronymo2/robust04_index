			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Ukrainian currency loses value Ukraine's non-convertible and volatile currency, the karbovanets, lost 16 per cent of its value on the open market over the weekend. The fall has been blamed on parliament's release of credits to the agriculture sector last month. Farm credits will push inflation up from 2.6 per cent in August to above 18 per cent this month, said Mr Viktor Youshchenko, central bank governor. Ukraine is set to initial an IMF letter of intent within two days and a final agreement should be finalised at next month's IMF summit, if certain reform conditions are met, western diplomats and aid officials said yesterday. The IMF policy prescriptions will increase inflation in the short run but the Dollars 700m loan will ease pressure by backing up national bank reserves and help cover Ukraine's widening balance of payments and budget deficits. An agreement also would open the doors to Dollars 4bn in western aid - including Dollars 400m from the World Bank for critical goods such as pharmaceuticals.</p>

			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Survey of Charities Investment and Finance (4): 'Social market' will join the economy - The Centris research project Voluntary Action, a report published in October by the Home Office for the Centris research project, will be best remembered for two things. First, its remarkable recommendation that charitable status and accompanying tax relief should be abolished. Second, the speed and force with which the government, at the level of speeches by the Prime Minister and the Home Secretary, distanced itself from the report and assured charities that tax relief was safe. So critical was the response to the report's plans for ending charitable status and tax relief that it diverted attention from the remainder of its contents, which recognised that the voluntary sector is undergoing fundamental change as a growing number of charities deliver welfare services financed by public contracts. The time had come, suggested the report, for such charities, National Health Service trust hospitals, and opted-out schools, housing associations and private sector companies involved in social activities, to be linked in a redefined third sector of the economy, or social market. 'The new economy would be regulated, controlled and promoted in various ways, and a key feature of it would be that there would be sufficient coherence to call it a third sector. Much service delivery. both at local and at national level, presently in the public, private and voluntary sectors, could go into it.' The Centris report reflects a growing interest in the social market or social economy, a concept which traditionally has had less clarity in the UK than some other European Union countries, such as France. Publication of the report coincided with a forum on the social economy organised by Unity Trust Bank, which brought together representatives of a wide range of organisations that could fit within a definition of the social economy. As speakers at the forum acknowledged, the first hurdle - definition - is not a easy one to jump. If all potential candidates were included, the social economy could encompass building societies, provident private health insurers and co-operatives, as well as charities, housing associations, trust hospitals and similar organisations. Mr Paul Ramadier, an EU official, told the Unity Trust seminar that on such a broad definition, social economy organisations were of enormous economic and social importance. There are 100m members of insurance and healthcare mutuals in Europe, and social economy enterprises account for 20 per cent of European savings. The co-operative sector has 60m members and has provided 3m jobs. Mr Ramadier identified two social issues, unemployment, and the increasing proportion of elderly people in the population, as examples of areas where the contribution of organisations from the social economy would increase. 'The resources of the whole community will need mobilising, and in my view that can only be done through social economy organisations.' The seminar described social economy organisations as those 'engaging in economic activity to fulfil primarily social, mutual or community objectives.' While resisting a tighter definition, delegates agreed that it would be helpful if policymakers took the sector's contribution more seriously. There are plans for an annual social economy forum with a standing committee, and an exchange of ideas and information. A concern expressed at the Unity Trust seminar was that there was a 'damaging association of not-for-profit organisations with inefficiency' - a particular concern in the voluntary sector. Many third sector organisations believe their managerial skills stand up well to public or private sector comparison, and are looking for ways of spreading this message.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- COMPANIES GIVING POUNDS 5M OR MORE TO CHARITY 1992/3  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Charity                     Total corporate support (Pounds 000)*  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Abbey National                                6,020 Barclays                                      7,520 British Petroleum                            11,000+ BT                                           14,646 ICI                                           5,500 Marks and Spencer                             5,800 National Westminster Bank                    10,202 Shell UK                                      5,523 Unilever                                      5,000  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *Includes cash donations, value of sponsorship, secondment and other forms of support  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Charities Aid Foundation  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOP 10 GRANT-MAKING TRUSTS 1991/92*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Position    Name                                Grants (Pounds 000)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  1          Wellcome Trust                      92,300  2          Tudor Trust                         20,234  3          Royal Society                       17,383  4          British Academy                     16,350  5          Wolfon Foundation                   14,913  6          Gatsby Charitable Foundation        13,701  7          Henry Smith (Estates Charities)     11,687  8          Leverhulme Trust                    10,549  9          City Parochial Foundation            8,887 10          Baring Foundation                    7,936  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Excludes UK branch of the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, a Portuguese charitable foundation Source: Charities Aid Foundation  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Appetisers FOR THE fifth year in succession Champagne will be faced with a large vintage and, unless bad weather intervenes, a very good one. It will be picked several weeks earlier than usual - within the first 10days of September. In view of the very high level of unsold stocks, the price of grapes is likely to be lower than last year, which will be decided between merchants and growers at the end of next month as a recommended figure, perhaps as low as FFr20 a kilo for the top commune grapes. EDMUND PENNING-ROWSELL Following the decision taken by the EC on June 1 to tax beer at 'factory gate' strength as opposed to the cumbersome system of original gravity (which measures potential alcohol), Camra's monthly journal What's Brewing reports a move made by at least two major brewers to avoid higher duty by reducing the alcoholic strength of their ales and lagers. This could also involve an increase in the levels of unfermented malt sugar in the beer in an attempt to disguise any resulting flavour imbalance. Those chiefly involved to date are Bass and Courage. The following brands are affected: Webster's Yorkshire Bitter, Wilson's Original Bitter, Worthington's Best Bitter and Holsten Pils lager. One brewer which has not gone in for this sort of thing is Britain's oldest, Shepherd Neame, in Faversham, Kent. It has not only maintained its good reputation for cask-conditioned ales, but also been at the forefront of the revival of good bottle-conditioned beers. The latest to arrive is Spitfire, a bitter originally brewed to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Britain. It is a suitably hoppy ale, given Kent's position as the centre of Britain's hop-farming business. Spitfire is available in 500cl bottles from Shepherd Neame pubs, priced around Pounds 1.82, and from select branches of Safeway at about Pounds 1.45. The beer contains yeast and should be poured with care. GILES MACDONOGH Owners of the Stratford label blend California wine have been able to offer better value West Coast wine than most. Majestic, in particular, has been a good source of their Zinfandel, Chardonnay and Cabernet. But the best buy to date must be their Pinot Noir, Pounds 4.89 from better branches of Victoria Wine until the end of this month. I was fooled into pricing it several pounds higher when served this juicy, rich red. A second bottle might cloy, but the first should delight both palate and pocket. JANCIS ROBINSON Many wine drinkers are intrigued by the idea of becoming wine tasters, but are reluctant to expose themselves to public ridicule. The Wine Society of Stevenage (0438-740222) has the perfect answer: eight very different six-bottle tasting cases which come with a sensible booklet, How to Taste, tasting sheets, and detailed notes on each case's theme and the individual wines. Prices range from Pounds 34.50 for the basic assortment, to Pounds 65.75 for six half bottles of sweet wine which constitute 'the best of the bunch'. There is a Pounds 20 life membership fee.

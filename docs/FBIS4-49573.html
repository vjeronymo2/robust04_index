			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chang Weimin: "CNPC Looks Abroad for Oil Business"] </F>   [Text] The Chinese petroleum industry is broadening its  global business horizons by consolidating old footholds in some  countries and establishing new ones elsewhere.    The China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) says its overseas  operations are advancing as scheduled.    In the meantime, it says, conditions are suitable for  opening  new areas for petroleum exploration and development.    In an interview with Business Weekly, Zhang Yongyi, CNPC's  vice-president, cited the example of old oil wells in Peru that  have been upgraded by Chinese technicians and are now producing  more oil.    CNPC signed a contract with Petrol Peru last year for  further  development of a 182-square-kilometre block in an old oilfield.  Production at the oilfield, which was discovered in 1874, has  declined after more than 100 years of exploitation.    CNPC, which produces some 140 million tons of crude oil a  year, has mature technology and enough equipment for enhancing  oil recovery, Zhang said.    In a couple of North and Latin American nations, CNPC is  conducting seismic work, Zhang revealed.    In Thailand, CNPC has made progress in developing oil.  Another CNPC official said Chinese are doing preparatory work  for constructing an oilfield.    In Papua New Guinea, CNPC will explore for oil in one block  code- named 160 and another named Kamusi. CNPC is teaming up  with companies from Japan and Hong Kong in the exploration.    After leading a business group to the Central Asian nations  of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan last  month, Zhang said new fields for cooperation will be opened  there. Zhang was travelling with a Chinese Government  delegation headed by Premier Li Peng.    Zhang believes prospects for Chinese co-operation with the  four republics are good since the needs of all five countries  are complementary.    Two letters of intent for closer ties were signed by CNPC  and  the petroleum sectors of Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.    More co-operation is expected in the exploration,  development  and trade of crude oil and natural gas.    According to the letters of intent, technical exchanges and  visits to oilfields will be more frequent than before.    CNPC and Turkmenistan reaffirmed their desires to work  together, along with the Japanese industrial conglomerate  Mitsubishi, to develop natural gas.    Construction of a pipeline is being considered to carry  natural gas from Turkmenistan to Japan by way of China. Gas  resources in Turkmenistan are estimated at 20,000 billion cubic  metres.    Zhang cited several advantages for CNPC in improving  petroleum cooperation with Central Asia:    -- Proximity, which ensures convenience in co-operative  exploration, development and trade;    -- Chinese technology, engineering and experience, which  suit  the needs of the four nations;    -- Similar economic and social conditions, which enhance  mutual understanding as the five countries make the transition  from rigid central planning to market economies.</p>

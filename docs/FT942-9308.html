			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Business chief to head probe of Treasury The Treasury yesterday announced that a leading industrialist will supervise a planned internal review of its senior management structure and disclosed details of the fundamental review of its spending and running costs that was announced with the November 1993 Budget. Sir Colin Southgate, chairman of Thorn EMI and PowerGen and a member of the Court of the Bank of England, will supervise a 'senior open structure review' looking into possible changes to the way the Treasury deploys senior staff. As part of the review of running costs, Sir Colin will supervise an examination by Treasury staff of how work in their directorates should be developed and organised. Detailed work on the organisation of directorates and the allocation of resources will be carried out by a team headed by Mr Jeremy Heywood, who was principal private secretary to Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Norman Lamont, his predecessor. This part of the review, which will also look at the Treasury's relations with other organisations and how to contain spending growth, will be completed in the autumn. The Treasury review of its programme expenditure, such as payments to the Bank of England and Royal Mint, will be co-ordinated by Mr Kit Chivers. The results will influence the Treasury's internal budgeting for 1995-96.</p>

			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Money Markets: UK rates steady UK money market rates were little changed yesterday although conditions were squeezed as repurchase agreements set in January reached maturity, writes Simon London. The Bank of England forecast a liquidity shortage of Pounds 650m early in the session, later revised up to Pounds 750m. The main component was maturing repurchase agreements set last month, draining Pounds 1.106bn from the market. This was moderated by exchequer transactions, which added a net Pounds 620m to the system. However, rates were steady early in the day at below 11 per cent and the Bank of England added only Pounds 22m funding during the morning session, through the purchase of band 1 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent. Afternoon assistance amounted to a more substantial Pounds 368m, again through the outright purchase of band 1 and band 2 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent. A late liquidity injection of Pounds 70m bought total assistance for the day to Pounds 560m. Despite the net drain of funds during the day, overnight money rates were stable. The unsecured overnight money rate closed at 10 - 9/16 per cent from 10 3/4 - 5/8 per cent at the end of last week. One month interbank money closed at 10 - 5/8 per cent; three-month interbank funds closed at 10 5/8 - 1/2 per cent. The March short sterling contract on the London International Financial Futures Exchange was weaker, closing at 89.63 from 89.67 at the close on Friday. Analysts commented that the pay settlement between German steel workers and employers for a 6.4 per cent pay offer meant that German interest rates are likely to stay high for some time. This could limit the ability of the UK government to reduce interest rates, a factor reflected in the futures market. The closing level of the March sterling contract implies bank base lending rates of 10.37 per cent by the Spring. In Frankfurt call money interest rates eased following the sharp month-end liquidity squeeze last week. Call money traded mostly at 9.60/70 per cent, from a peak of 9.75 per cent on Friday. The tight conditions last week were reflected in the amounts borrowed by financial institutions at the Lombard rate, the Bundesbank's emergency funding rate. Lombard borrowings rose to DM7.1bn on Friday, from DM2.1bn on Thursday.</p>

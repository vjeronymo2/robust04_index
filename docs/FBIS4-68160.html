			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Dr. Musa Abu-Marzuq, the chief of Hamas'  Political Bureau, has reaffirmed that resisting the occupation  is a strategic option for Hamas until the occupation is defeated  and all Palestinian lands are liberated, primarily Jerusalem,  the capital of Palestine and the land of the prophet's ascension  to heavens and of all holy sites. [passage omitted]    Answering a question about the relationship between Hamas  and  the alliance of the 10 factions, Abu-Marzuq said: We have a  good relationship despite recent reports casting doubt on this  relationship, which will remain pivotal for us.    Abu-Marzuq further stressed that Hamas seeks to develop this  relationship so the alliance can undertake its important jihad  role to defeat the Oslo and Cairo accords, as an indispensable  step before resuming the plan of liberation.    Abu-Marzuq, who had just heard about the unjust Zionist  bombing of the [Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]  General Command positions in al-Na'imah, expressed his sympathy  and solidarity with the heroes of the General Command, saying:  We complement each other in the same trench and course.  [passage omitted]    On the fate of the 10 factions that oppose the settlement if  a Syrian-Israeli agreement is reached, Abu-Marzuq said he rules  out the possibility of such agreement in the short run,  considering the solid Syrian position. He stressed, however,  that the major organizational body of Hamas is inside the  occupied territories. Therefore, it remains free from influence  by any Palestinian or Arab agreements.    Commenting on the entry of the Palestinian police force into  Gaza and Jericho, Abu-Marzuq said: These forces are from the  sons of the Palestinian people and some of them fought heroic  battles for liberation. Therefore, we will welcome their  presence among the people there as long as they are protecting  the people's security. This position will change if these forces  change their attitude and turn into political forces to suppress  strugglers and opponents from various national and Islamic  political currents and persuasions.</p>

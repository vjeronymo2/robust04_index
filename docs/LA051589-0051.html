			<p><P> May 15, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP CAPSULES : LITTLE CAESAR AT THE PALACE: BLOOD ON THE KICKSTAND  </P> <P> Fire up the Harley, suck back a coupla cans of 30-weight, 'n' gitcherself a new  tattoo, Betty Lou, 'cause Little Caesar is playin' the rockin' role of the  ultimate biker-bar band right down to the blood on the kickstand. Supercharged  by Ron Young's self-deprecating sarcasm and strong vocals, these tattooed love  boys also packed a certain tunefulness into their heavily R&amp;B-based  material during their set at the Palace on Friday, particularly when working at  mid-tempo. (The headbanging riffslingers are less distinctive.)  </P> <P> The local quintet could also lose the brew-spewing, buddy-buddy routines. They  don't need 'em. Not when they can grind out a dirty whiteboy version of Aretha  Franklin's "Chain of Fools" that's reminiscent of nothing less than Detroit,  those semi-legendary Motor City mamajammas led by Mitch Ryder back in 1972.  Maybe even better.  </P> <P> S.F.-based Jet Boy, which headlined the show, is the Living Definition of  Mediocrity. Probably best at ersatz glamslam stuff such as "Feel the Shake" --  the title track of their recent debut LP -- and predictably worst when  bludgeoning their way through hoary blooze root-tines. After 40 minutes there  were almost as many people schmoozing in the lobby as there were inside  watching these poseurs rolloverundersidewaysdown. DON WALLER  </P></p>

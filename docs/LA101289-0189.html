			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE;  </P> <P> AN HISTORIC FARMHOUSE IS RESCUED  </P> <P> The old farmhouse in east Irvine doesn't look like much.  </P> <P> Dirty white paint hangs from its sides. The weather has torn at the roof,  taking a few shingles. There is no foundation or porch, because the house was  built to be moved to farm plots as needed.  </P> <P> But where some see a dilapidated tenant farmer building, others see history.  For Judy Liebeck, a member of the Irvine Historical Society, the  turn-of-the-century oak farmhouse was a rare piece of the past.  </P> <P> Liebeck, a historical conservationist who has come to the rescue of similar  buildings, recently convinced Irvine city officials to appropriate more than  $15,000 to move the house from the path of the proposed widening of the Santa  Ana Freeway near Jeffrey Road.  </P> <P> "We are finding that more and more of these great old houses are being lost  because nobody really cares about them. A freeway will take priority over  something that has been there much, much longer," Liebeck said, adding:  </P> <P> "Nothing is old in this city. People who move to Irvine from other parts of the  country think everything started new and planned here. The last buildings of  the Irvine Ranch are the only reminders that Irvine has a past."  </P> <P> At a time when Irvine was virtually a collection of open fields and orange  groves, James E. Irvine built the tenant farmer quarters to house the family  that would run the ranch's lima bean operations.  </P> <P> The first occupant, George O. Cooke, came to the ranch to find steady work  after the California Gold Rush died. His family lived there until the  mid-1950s, and the house was never rented again.  </P> <P> When farming as an industry died, the house became an anachronism as rows of  housing tracts sprang up.  </P> <P> Even though the house has been reviewed for state recognition as a historical  landmark, Liebeck said that she has found little sympathy from the city and the  Irvine Co., which owns the house. The Irvine Ranch Water District provided the  only corporate help: a parcel of land which will serve as a temporary site for  the house, she said.  </P> <P> "Some people at the Irvine Co. see the historical value of houses like this one  but don't want to act on it because it would be a hassle to move them and keep  them up," she said. "They are a big company, and I can see how they would  rather build over them, rather then (relocate) them."  </P> <P> In the next year, the Irvine Historical Society is expected to ask the City  Council to save two more houses, but Mayor Larry Agran said he might be  reluctant to spend more money unless the houses would "serve some economic  value" for the city.  </P> <P> "I don't know if we should undertake similar costs in the future, unless we can  find a use for them," he said. "Could it house a real tenant farmer, be part of  a model farm or help transitional families who have no homes? I don't have any  problems in avoiding demolition, but we have to identify an economic or social  return to the community."  </P> <P> Liebeck looks to the city of Santa Ana as a prime example of old homes being  restored. French Park, for example, contains homes representing a cross-section  of styles from different eras of the city's history. Though the houses are  occupied, walking tours of the neighborhoods are held regularly.  </P> <P> While many historical structures are now being used for commercial purposes in  Irvine, the society would like to see houses grouped together as in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> "I think it would be a great idea to use them to help educate the community  about Irvine's past," Liebeck said. "We need that kind of historical value. We  could be doing so much for the community, and future communities, by saving  these houses. Not many people grow up in a neighborhood void of anything  historical." JOE BEL BRUNO  </P></p>

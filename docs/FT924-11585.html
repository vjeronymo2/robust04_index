			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Chinese concerns hit HSBC BANKING group HSBC was one of the principal casualties in the FT-SE 100 Index yesterday. Political and technical factors conspired to leave shares in the international bank 20 lower at 480p. The stock had spiked up sharply from just over 400p at the start of the month as the Hong Kong stock market raced up and UK investors piled into HSBC as a hedge against a weak pound. Yesterday, news that China was threatening to pull out of a deal to build a new airport on the island sent sent tremors through a number of Far Eastern stocks. This coincided with a note from County NatWest pointing out that the Hong Kong market had reached an all-time high and it was time to take profits in selected stocks. As a result, the HSBC ordinary shares opened 10 off and moved down steadily throughout the day attracting consistent sellers and final turnover of 6.2m shares. However, County's banking analyst Mr John Aitken said institutions who had been up to strength in Midland were left 60 per cent underweight by the HSBC takeover and were still trying to get up to strength. Cable &amp; Wireless was also affected by the political worries and the shares fell 12 to 595p. Shell down again Integrated oil company Shell Transport was hit by a strong sell note. In a market that seemed to lack direction Shell shares moved sharply down at the start of trading and closed a net 6 lower at 529p with 5.9m traded. County NatWest's oils analyst Mr Fergus Macleod, who has already issued two bearish notes on the stock this month, published an internal note that reflected a hardened opinion on the shares. He said there were no immediate prospects for an upturn in the European petrochemicals market and Shell's P/E relative to the market is at an all-time high with the yield close to its low. He cut his 1993 profit forecast by Pounds 230m to Pounds 2.57bn and warned of further downgradings if the trend continues. Interest was revived in the tour operators on two counts. First, leading charter airline Dan Air announced a takeover and then the recent persistent bid talk in the sector resurfaced. The takeover and restructuring of Dan Air by British Airways takes some one million seats out of the charter market, according to analysts. They say it boosts, among others, the integrated tour groups Airtours and Owners Abroad, both of which maintain their own airlines. They were also lifted by the publication of figures which showed bookings for next year 10 per cent ahead on the same period a year ago. Sources close to Owners yesterday denied a story that the group was considering a management buy-out and confirmed that negotiations with German holiday group LTU were continuing. LTU is said to be interested in a substantial stake in Owners, Britain's second biggest tour operator. Airtours, also a rumoured predator, is known to be monitoring the situation. The renewed talk, together with the Dan Air and booking news, lifted Airtours 13 to 225p. Owners was steady at 74p. BA eased 4 to 305p. However, one analyst said the move was good for BA as it 'is not very dilutive, and it strengthens BA's position at Gatwick and its European feeder services.' In a strong hotel sector, Stakis was the best performer on suggestions that it was considering the flotation of its nursing homes subsidiary. Another version had a management buy-out as favourite. Either way, the company, which has debts of some Pounds 180m, would hope to raise upwards of Pounds 50m. Recent institutional presentation were also said to have been well received. The shares rose 5 1/2 to 32 1/2 p. Queens Moat gained 3 to 38p in large turnover of 9.1m, the top traded stock of the day. Forte added 5 to 179p on raised hopes that its Gardner Merchant subsidiary may soon be sold. Compass Group, which failed in its bid for the catering group, has renewed its interest. The shares rose 7 to 442p. ICI fell 20 to 1047p as nervousness grew ahead of third quarter figures next Thursday. Hoare Govett reaffirmed a cautious stance on the stock saying the industrial outlook continues awkward in the light of deteriorating industrial figures and profit estimates are still on the high side. News that the government's Health and Safety Executive is to prosecute industrial chemicals group Allied Colloids following a fire in July at the company's raw materials warehouse hit the shares which fell 8 to 212p. Vodafone rose 6 to 377p, helped by an upgrade from UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. The house is looking for Pounds 310m this year, up from Pounds 295m, impressed by the response to the telecoms group's new 'Low Call' service and the stimulus it has provided to the rest of its services. Reuters Holdings bounced 21 to 1223p following an international conference call on Thursday night by the chief executive. SG Warburg was encouraged by what it saw as veiled good news and told clients to look for buying opportunities. However, there is a definite two-way pull on the stock and agency broker James Capel sees no reason to change its view that the stock is overrated. SG Warburg was positive on Carlton Communications. The shares lifted 7 to 725p. Thames Television rose 5 to 174p on reports that Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest could become a leading shareholder in the company's Channel 5 bid. A recommendation from Smith New Court to take profits in the short-term in Tate &amp; Lyle held back the shares which retreated 11 to 357p. The broker also moved to a buy in Unigate as a good yield stock. The shares fell back 5 to 263p. Hanson's bid document for RHM caused little stir with most brokers still advising clients to wait for an improved offer. RHM rose 2 to 249p, Hanson edged forward a penny to 233p. Shares in BM Group climbed 7 to 77p, boosted by a favourable analysts visit to the company on Thursday. A shortage of stock left Hunting 8 better at 163p. Profit-takers gained the upper hand in GKN and early gains were surrendered to leave the shares only a penny firmer at 415p. Lucas Industries was in demand and closed 2 up at 107p. A profits downgrading said to have come from Kleinwort Benson knocked Ocean Group. The shares fell 15 to 189p. Fears over Hong Kong hurt several other stocks. These included Inchcape which derives a substantial part of its revenue from the territory. It fell 14 to 504p, in trade of 2.1m, while shares in Trafalgar House, a member of the consortium building a bridge that is part of the airport project, eased a penny to 87 1/2 p, on the same worries. Wellcome, which is to publish full-year figures on Wednesday improved 9 to 991p, following recent US profit-taking. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (76).

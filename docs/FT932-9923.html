			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Russians use veto on Cyprus peace force RUSSIA last night cast the first veto in the UN Security Council since the end of the cold war to kill a British resolution that would have made financing of the voluntarily-funded UN force in Cyprus a mandatory charge on all member states by assessment. The force, which has served as a peacekeeping buffer since 1964, is facing a serious reduction in strength, to about 1,500 troops, by the withdrawal of the Canadian contingent. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, supported the proposal by Britain, the biggest troop contributor, that it was time to end a financing arrangement which places a heavy burden on countries supplying troops. Russia has paid nothing. The force, costing Dollars 47m (Pounds 30.5m) a year and in financial difficulties virtually since its inception, is the only UN peacekeeping operation subject to voluntary funding. Western delegates were alarmed by the Russian action, which appears to pose a serious threat to the continued presence of the force in Cyprus. Mr Boutros Ghali is due to reopen negotiations on May 24 on a political settlement with local leaders. Mr Yuli Vorontsov, the Russian delegate, who is also the Council president this month, did his utmost to avoid having to cast the veto - the first by any member since May 1990 and the first by Moscow since February 1984 - but evidently was overruled.</p>

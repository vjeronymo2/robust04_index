			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Another consequence of the standards will be the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) emissions. For standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total estimated CO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  reduction would be 43 million tons. During this time period, the peak annual reduction of CO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions that are expected to be emitted by power plants in the United States is 0.07 percent. For standard levels 2 and 3, the reductions are 108 million tons and 263 million tons, respectively. The highest peak annual reduction of these levels is 0.29 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Decreasing future electricity demand is also likely to result in reductions in the demand for oil used in electricity generation. Because virtually all sources of oil, on the margin, are foreign, any reductions in oil demand are likely to be reflected in reductions in oil imports. For standard level 1, the estimated decrease in oil imports is 8.86 million barrels over the years 1996 to 2030. For standard levels 2 and 3, the reductions in oil imports are estimated to be 22.05 and 53.88, respectively.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Conclusion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 325(l)(2)(A) of the Act specifies that the Department must consider, for amended standards, those standards that ``achieve the maximum improvement in energy efficiency which the Secretary determines is technologically feasible and economically justified.'' Accordingly, the Department first considered the max tech level of efficiency, i.e., standard level 3 for amended television set standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Of the standard levels analyzed, level 3 will save the most energy (3.13 quads between 1996 and 2030). In order to meet this standard, the Department assumes that all television sets will have reduced standby power and reduced white/black screen power.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After carefully considering the analysis, the Department is establishing a standard for television sets. The Department concludes that standard level 3 for television sets saves a significant amount of energy and is technologically feasible and economically justified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There would be significant energy savings at this level of efficiency. During the period 1996&hyph;2030, these savings are calculated to be 3.13 quads of primary energy. In addition, the standard could have a positive effect on the environment by reducing the emissions of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  by 528,000 tons and 599,000 tons, respectively, or by as much as 0.29 percent each by the year 2030. Furthermore, the standard will reduce emissions of CO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  by 263 million tons, or 0.29 percent, over the forecast period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The technologies that are necessary to meet this standard are presently available. The Department finds the level to be economically justified. The consumer payback of this standard level is 3.5 years, which compares favorably with the 12-year product life. This standard has the lowest life-cycle cost and is expected to result in a reduction in life-cycle cost of approximately $24. Additionally, the standard is expected to have only a slight reduction in the prototypical manufacturer's return on equity of negative 1.9 percent. Since this standard does not involve substantial redesign or retooling, the Department expects that it will not have negative impacts on smaller competitors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> V.

			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / Instability continues as Collor hangs on SEASONAL cheer was notably absent among Brazilians yesterday, faced with the unwelcome prospect of continued instability as a result of Monday night's ploy by suspended President Fernando Collor to delay his impeachment by sacking his lawyers. Brazilians had expected that by Christmas Mr Collor would have been definitively stripped of power, enabling Mr Itamar Franco, the acting president, to formally take office and start giving some much-needed direction to the economy. A long-talked about fiscal reform was due to have been approved by the Congress so that next year the government could make some attempt at balancing its budget. However, the delay in the impeachment trial until December 29 or later means the politicians will continue to be distracted from fiscal reform which now cannot be voted till next year. Mr Franco's speech setting out economic policy scheduled for today has been delayed until after the judgment. Although there is little doubt that Mr Collor will be ousted eventually, Mr Pedro Simon, the Senate leader of the acting government, explains: 'As an acting president Itamar cannot announce definitive plans because he doesn't know if he will be confirmed president.' As a result of the uncertainty, monthly inflation is now pushing 27 per cent and the black market dollar premium has reached 25 per cent. The fear is that Mr Collor will try another manoeuvre to win more time in the hope that Mr Franco's perceived incompetence and nationalist rhetoric will inspire senators to wish for the return of Mr Collor. Mr Odacir Soares, one of Mr Collor's few supporters in the Senate, says: 'Many senators are now looking at Collor with more sympathy and we believe this tendency is increasing.' One aide said Mr Collor might appeal to the international court of human rights alleging that he was not being given a fair trial. Mr Sidney Sanches, the head of the Supreme Court, who will preside over Mr Collor's judgment, appears determined to prevent further delays beyond December 29 and yesterday appointed Mr Inocencia Martires Coelho, a former attorney general, to handle Mr Collor's defence. But Mr Mauro Benevides, president of the Senate, admitted 'it will be very difficult to get a quorum during the holiday period'. In one positive development the Senate approved on Monday night the text of an agreement with foreign creditors over Dollars 44bn commercial debt. The majority was 42 to 2. The termsheet, which was agreed in July, will now return to the advisory committee of creditor banks for final review and selection of instruments, and Brazil will increase its interest payments from 30 per cent to 50 per cent.</p>

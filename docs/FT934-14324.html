			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Cosatu's strike call shuns ANC THE Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu), the country's largest union grouping, has called a national strike for November 15 to protest against the treatment of workers' rights in the draft constitution. The call surprised political observers as it did not appear to have been discussed with Cosatu's partners, the African National Congress (ANC) and South African Communist Party. It would seem to indicate a determination by Cosatu, with 1.2m paid-up members, to continue as an independent voice for workers regardless of its political ties. Mr Sam Shilowa, the group's general secretary, said at the weekend the strike would go ahead unless negotiators at the democracy talks agreed to removed a clause in the constitution guaranteeing the tenure of civil servants after the election next April, and removed a clause from the interim bill of rights enabling employers to lock out striking workers. Cosatu believes that entrenching the positions of existing civil servants - aimed at quelling the fears of largely white incumbents - will impede democratisation of the civil service. Namibia adopted a similar policy at independence in 1990 and the large bureaucracy is proving an unmanageable fiscal burden. Mr Shilowa said the strike had been scheduled to be held a week before the planned special sitting of parliament on November 22 which would formally pass the constitution. The talks, however, remain far from complete with important issues like regional powers, and how a government of national unity will function, undecided. The conservative Freedom Alliance is also continuing to stand outside the main negotiating process. Mr Shilowa said the length of the strike had still to be decided.</p>

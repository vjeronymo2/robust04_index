			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / UK Company News (Results Preview): Hopes rest on answers to crucial questions - Profits are rising. But high share valuations imply companies can produce rapid earnings growth at a time of low inflation and slow economic growth. FT writers assess the prospects Many in the City believe that the UK corporate earnings outlook has rarely been so positive. The forthcoming round of results will test this optimism. Inflation is dying, or at least dormant, business surveys are optimistic, and the prospect of sustained output growth and gradually declining unemployment stretch out ahead, or so the high stock market valuations indicate. The fundamental question is: can companies rapidly expand their earnings in a low inflation, low growth economic environment? The stock market seems to believe they can. With hopes so high, analysts and investors will be paying close attention to the commentary on prospects accompanying results statements. 'The key thing will be chairmen's statements. The market is increasingly moving towards recovery stories,' one market strategist said. 'If we get down-beat statements on 1994, it could severely effect the market.' Answers to a number of crucial questions will help determine whether or not investors' hopes are speeding ahead of commercial realities. Among the issues are: What is the outlook for sales growth? The volume of new orders is growing at the strongest rate for five years, encouraged by a gradual revival in demand, according to the latest industrial trends survey by the Confederation of British Industry. J Sainsbury, the supermarket chain, recently demonstrated how crucial performance statements can be. Its comments on shrinking margins resulted in a one-day drop of 11 per cent in its share price. What is the exposure to overseas markets? Exports to the US are already benefiting from its economic upturn and the relative strength of the dollar. By contrast, in the late 1980s, many companies had expanded into continental Europe hoping to benefit from the single market. But with economic recovery on the Continent lagging behind Britain's, some companies are finding weak export sales offsetting the domestic pickup. Is restructuring paying off? The recession forced many companies into hefty restructuring of their operations and balance sheets. Are the benefits coming through to the bottom line? If they need to restructure further, can their balance sheets take the hit? In a low inflationary environment, lower unit costs are crucial, given the economic pressures against raising prices. This results season has been preceded by three years of severe rationalisation. Warburg Securities' Smallco, a portfolio of 162 industrial companies with a market capitalisation of Pounds 20bn, gives a strong indication of trends, since smaller companies tend to react more rapidly to economic changes. The portfolio suffered total exceptional losses of Pounds 674m during 1991 and 1992, because of restructuring costs and balance sheet write-downs. This figure is forecast to drop to Pounds 90m in 1993 and Pounds 3m in 1994, as costs have been pared to the bone, and asset prices stabilise. How much spare capacity is there? The recession triggered a substantial reduction in industrial capacity through business failures, mergers and plant rationalisations. Just how far the process has gone is difficult to judge. Capacity utilisation data are notoriously unreliable. However, there are signs of more manufacturing companies operating at or near capacity. If this is the case, it could undermine confidence that the inflationary dragon has indeed been slain. According to the latest CBI figures, 57 per cent of companies are operating below capacity - the smallest percentage since October 1990, and well down on the 70 per cent levels reported during 1991 and 1992. Of even more concern, one in eight companies currently expect capacity constraints to limit output in the short-term. If capacity is tightening, will companies try to push up prices? Some building materials suppliers, for example, have already pushed through modest price increases. For some capital intensive industries, production capacity has already become an important issue. The cement industry, for example, cut production through the recession, but now finds demand rebounding. Cement makers are suggesting they will import surplus stocks from recession-hit European manufacturers when they run out of capacity rather than invest in new plant. This implies inflationary bottle necks at a later stage. What are the impediments to increasing output? Job cuts continue in some sectors, notably financial services and manufacturing industry. Yet, unemployment fell below 10 per cent of the working population in December, for the first time since July 1992. Indeed, in some sectors, labour shortages have emerged. Last month, Magellan Industries, a lingerie and swimwear manufacturer (mainly for Marks and Spencer), issued a profits warning because it could not cope with demand. So far, such examples of pressures on unit costs are rare. More companies expect unit costs to fall than rise, thanks to low inflation and increased productivity. This was only the second time such a response was recorded in 36 years. Is capital spending rising? If optimism is well-founded, there should already be signs of spending on new plant and machinery, as excess capacity diminishes. The CBI found a balance of companies anticipating increased expenditure on non-property fixed assets. Yet surprisingly, Warburg's Smallco is forecast to show a 5 per cent drop in capital expenditure in 1993, and a further 2 per cent dip in 1994. This would reflect falling prices of productive assets, and slack production levels. But it has negative implications for the capital goods sector and raises questions over whether optimism will turn into investment. It also suggests that some managers are holding back from investing in new plant because they are demanding an unrealistically high rate of return given the low inflation environment.</p>

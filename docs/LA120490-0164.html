			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> BLACK ISSUE TESTS MAJOR'S VISION  </P> <P> Prime Minister John Major's vision of a "society of opportunity" faces an  immediate test from some Conservative Party members who are rebelling against a  black lawyer selected as their candidate for Parliament.  </P> <P> John Taylor, who hopes to be the first black Conservative in the House of  Commons, was selected last weekend by the Tory organization in Cheltenham, near  Gloucester in western England.  </P> <P> Some Conservatives complained they were given no choice but Taylor, and one  inflamed the controversy when he was quoted in a national newspaper as calling  the candidate "a bloody nigger."  </P> <P> William Galbraith, a Conservative Party member in Cheltenham, confirmed today  that he had made the remark in a private conversation but had not expected to  be quoted.  </P> <P> Major, in his first major address to the Conservative Party organization today,  said he supports Taylor.  </P></p>

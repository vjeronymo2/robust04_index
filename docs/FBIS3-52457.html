In an interview with Radio London yesterday, al-'Anani  explained that the Palestinian side believes that the economic  agreement should be implemented following an agreement on Gaza  and Jericho while the Jordanian side believes it should precede  any Palestinian-Israeli agreement.    Dr. al-'Anani said that Jordan has had economic relations  with the West Bank and Gaza since 1967 and that this  relationship needs to be organized under the canopy of the new  framework. That is why there is no reason to postpone such a  reorganization until after the conclusion of the Gaza-Jericho  negotiations.    Dr. al-'Anani denied that the disagreement between the two  sides stems from the fact that the Palestinians want to have a  central bank of their own that will supervise the banks that  open in the West Bank. Al-'Anani said that the agreement  stipulates that banking arrangements included in the agreement  will remain in force until the end of the transitional period,  or the establishment of a central Palestinian monetary  institution, whichever takes place first.    Dr. al-'Anani emphasized that the PLO should coordinate with  Israel before coordinating with Jordan because any agreement  reached between Israel and the PLO directly affects Jordan.  [sentence as published]    Dr. al-'Anani said that the conclusion of an agreement  between the PLO and Jordan will have a positive impact on the  process of negotiations as this will reassure people that  Jordanian-Palestinian relations will be organized and clearly  defined relations based on sound foundations. Al-'Anani  affirmed that Jordanian-Palestinian coordination is very  important, and that is why they should not be exposed to the  political ups and downs that accompany the negotiations.    The Jordanian-Palestinian agreement that was finalized two  months ago stipulates the reopening of the Jordanian banks that  were operational in the occupied territories in 1967. The  agreement also tackles trade between the two sides and attempts  to invigorate them, and covers investments, infrastructure  contracts, free zones, and transit operations.</p>

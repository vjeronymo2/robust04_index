			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> REPORT BLAMES SCHOOL STAFFERS FOR WALKOUTS BY STUDENTS;  </P> <P> CENTINELA: TRUSTEES HIRED AN INVESTIGATOR TO DETERMINE WHETHER STUDENTS WERE  RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SPRING PROTESTS. BOARD CRITICS SAY THE CLAIMS IN HIS REPORT  ARE UNSUBSTANTIATED.  </P> <P> A report released this week concludes that student demonstrations this spring  at Hawthorne and Leuzinger high schools were organized by teachers,  administrators and security officers who were trying to prevent the newly  elected school board from taking an active role in district business.  </P> <P> Although the report was hailed by Trustee Pam Sturgeon and the board's  supporters as a first step toward getting to the bottom of what happened during  the demonstrations, it came under immediate fire by board critics who said its  allegations are unsubstantiated and that it unfairly targets blacks.  </P> <P> Nancy McKee, who has two daughters in the district, said she believes the  report "is going to start the healing process" by rooting out those people who  were responsible for the walkouts. "I think it's positive because they're going  to be able to clean out the bad seeds."  </P> <P> But board critic Adrain Briggs disagreed.  </P> <P> "It was a waste of time and money, and all of it was focused on trying to find  black folks in violation of something," said Briggs, a spokesman for the  Committee for Racial Free Education, a group of black parents and other  community activists who have been critical of the predominantly Latino school  board. "It doesn't have any validity whatsoever, and those charges wouldn't  stand up in a court of law."  </P> <P> However, Sturgeon said the report is preliminary and that she is confident the  investigator who wrote it has evidence to back up his findings. She said the  board will take no action on the report until the investigation is complete.  </P> <P> William Burnett, the private investigator who wrote the report, was hired by  Centinela Valley Union High School District trustees to look into suspicions  that students were not responsible for organizing the March 5-6 walkouts.  </P> <P> At the time of the demonstrations, several students said they decided to walk  out of class to protest a spate of racially motivated incidents that had  plagued the district and to show their support for Kenneth Crowe, the principal  of Hawthorne High. Crowe was reassigned to a teaching position earlier this  month.  </P> <P> But some teachers and others said most of the students joined the  demonstrations simply to get out of class and that few students at Leuzinger  High, where the protest marches began, even knew the name of the principal at  Hawthorne, the rival high school.  </P> <P> As part of the investigation, Burnett set up a toll-free phone number to allow  people with information about the walkouts to call in anonymously. Although  Burnett provided the trustees with the names of the district employees who  allegedly organized the walkouts, those names were not included in the  four-page report that was made public.  </P> <P> The report also did not identify the sources of the allegations nor the  documents that reportedly backed them up. Nor did it indicate the number of  people who called in anonymously or the number of those who agreed to be  interviewed in person.  </P> <P> Burnett said in his report that interviews he conducted and documents he  obtained during the inquiry led him to conclude that "the students did not act  independently" in walking out of school and that they were instead "used by  some employees of the school district to focus attention on the position of the  principal of Hawthorne High School, and upon allegations of racism that had  been raised during the previous election of the board of trustees."  </P> <P> The investigator also said he found evidence that "confidential school records  were released to outside interests and that school district equipment was used  to produce inflammatory material that was passed out during the  demonstrations."  </P> <P> Burnett cited 12 "reported incidents" that he said supported his conclusion  that district employees planned the student walkouts.  </P> <P> Among them are reports that two teachers tried to recruit other teachers to  help organize the walkouts, that teachers helped distribute pamphlets that were  handed out during the demonstrations, that the handwriting on one leaflet  appeared to match that of a teacher, and that a student had been observed  taking pamphlets out of the trunk of a car belonging to a faculty member.  </P> <P> In addition, he reported statements by security officers that they had been  told that a district administrator had approved the walkouts.  </P> <P> The report also said several security officers were observed passing out  handouts and that on the morning of the demonstrations they were told that  "they were to encourage students to participate" in the walkouts.  </P> <P> Hawthorne High Security Officer Cynthia Henderson, who said she was falsely  accused of passing out pamphlets by two other officers after the walkouts,  called the allegations lies and said the only pamphlets she ever saw were the  ones brought into the morning meeting by one of her accusers.  </P> <P> The report also alleges that a four-page handout passed out during the  demonstration contained facts that were unavailable to students and "could only  be found in the School District Administrative Offices."  </P> <P> The pamphlet, which was titled "A Failure to Stop the Lynching," contained  several examples of alleged racist incidents against black employees and  students. Board critic Briggs, who said he and other members of his  organization wrote the pamphlet, denied that district employees in any way  provided them with information for the pamphlet. The information, he said, came  from newspaper reports and parents who "know a lot more than you think they  know."  </P> <P> The report also says that a district official had given a speech to students a  few days before the walkouts that was "racially inflammatory and was intended  to incite the students."  </P> <P> Although the report does not name the official, former Supt. McKinley Nash, who  was fired from his post last week, said in an interview Wednesday that the  allegation refers to a comment he made during an assembly on Black History  Month. The Rev. Chet Gean, who is white, had spoken about racial integration in  the South. At the end of the assembly, a student asked Gean how he would feel  if his daughter dated a black man. Another student then questioned whether  racism existed anymore, Nash said.  </P> <P> "I came forward and told the youngsters it was unfair to attack anybody because  of their place of birth or their race and that racism exists everywhere in  America and among all groups, regardless of their race," Nash said.  </P> <P> Social studies teacher Arnold Tena, who was present during the assembly and who  is a strong critic of Nash, said he disagreed with some of his colleagues that  Nash's comments were inflammatory. But he said that he still believed Nash  played a role in the walkouts, an allegation Nash denies.  </P> <P> Nash, who said his attorney is preparing a written response to the report, said  Burnett never answered his requests for an interview and that "some of the  facts he alleges are incorrect."  </P> <P> He said he sent Burnett information concerning about 20 incidents in which  students contended that they had been harassed by teachers and staff members  before, during and after the walkouts. He said the documents might have shown a  motivation for the students to walk out, but they were sent back to him  accompanied by a letter by Trustee Ruth Morales telling him that Burnett would  not investigate those incidents.  </P> <P> Sturgeon said Burnett was hired solely to investigate the walkout, and there  are district procedures for handling harassment complaints.  </P> <P> Nash said the report troubled him because individuals "could be falsely accused  and not be given the right for redress and to defend themselves."  </P> <P> "I am concerned about any report that does not name people and does not give  people the ability to react, and for that reason that is frightening to me."  </P> <P> In a statement attached to the report, the trustees said they planned to use  the report to determine whether they will pursue "criminal or other  disciplinary action" against any employee found to have been involved.  </P> <P> U.S. Rep. Mervyn M. Dymally (D-Compton) said in an interview Wednesday that the  report "is not supported by the facts or any due process" and that he had  warned the trustees last month that they could be opening themselves up to  lawsuits if they use the report's findings to dismiss any employees from the  district.  </P> <P> An assessment of the district's racial tensions is due to be released soon by  the state Department of Education's Office of Intergroup Relations. In  addition, the federal Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights is  investigating allegations of racial harassment in the district.  </P></p>

During a popular rally in Ismailia today, the Awqaf minister  said that a stable Egypt that is influential on the world stage  is a safety valve for the Arab and Islamic worlds. He stressed  that Egypt's leading role in the Islamic world will not ebb  because the country is greater than any attempt to undermine it.  He said such attempts will merely serve to enhance its role.    Mahjub added that everyone must know that Egypt has no  designs on others, that history is witness to this, and that it  is only concerned with the security of its sister countries.    He urged the nation's ulema, in the name of Islam, to seek  to  unite the nation's ranks and protect its ideology, declaring  that any negligence in this sphere is a crime against religion  and the homeland.    Regarding freedom in Islam, Mahjub said that freedom in  Islam  means commitment and good behavior, not chaos and disunity.    He added that any attempt to slander religion is a call to  dismember the homeland and cannot be termed freedom of  expression. Mahjub said: Slandering religion is as unacceptable  as terrorism under the guise of religion.</p>

			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MALATHION CONTROVERSY  </P> <P> I applaud your editorial because the flies are far more acceptable than  constant, perpetual malathion spraying. The pesticide lobby claims that farmers  will be forced to leave the state.  </P> <P> Fine, let them leave. California has many profitable industries which do not  require that the population be doused with pesticides on a continuing basis.  Concerns over health should override concerns for profit.  </P> <P> To all those who sit in their living rooms smugly content with the knowledge  that they are not in a spraying area, take another look into the night sky.  Every time they spray in our area, the helicopters are flying higher. This does  cut down on the noise and terror factor, but it also ensures that gentle  breezes are wafting the poison over a much greater area. So look for the  telltale brown spots.  </P> <P> JOHN VORNHOLT  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

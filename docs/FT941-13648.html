			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / DTI seeks extent of pension exposure The Department of Trade and Industry has told life companies to make the best estimate they can of their exposure resulting from mis-selling of personal pensions to individuals leaving occupational pension schemes. Debate has focused on concern about mis-selling to people transferring out of schemes where they had already left the company. However, the DTI wants also to be certain about life insurers' exposure on sales of private pensions to people who opted out of schemes where they were still employed. It has asked the companies to deliver their estimates by the end of the month. Although the number of 'opt-outs' is much smaller than the estimated 500,000 pension transfers, in cases where there is a need for compensation, individual payments are likely to be much higher. The DTI inquiry is directed at establishing whether the exposure of any life company threatens its solvency. The department has advised life companies that where they are likely to have a liability, this should be recognised either in the mathematical reserves or in the provisions made in the accounts. Different methods will be appropriate for different types of company and the business they write. Companies must file returns within six months of the year-end to , the DTI. Where a specific provision for mis-selling does not appear in a life office's returns to the DTI or in its accounts the company must provide it separately to the department. Both the DTI and the life industry recognise that this first estimate is bound to contain several uncertainties. For example the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, is not expected to publish until the summer its conclusions about how to compensate pensions-transfer customers who have suffered as a result of bad advice. TSB earlier this month made 'prudent' provisions - estimated to be no more than Pounds 10m - for possible compensation payments to its 55,000 pension transfer customers.</p>

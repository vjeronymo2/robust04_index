			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Carpenter gives Maxwell pensioners fresh hope FRESH HOPE may be on the way for pensioners of the private Maxwell companies because of an Italian carpenter whose company went bust. The carpenter and his colleagues successfully sued the Italian government in the European Court for compensation under a little known European Community directive which became binding on member states in 1983. Mr Robin Ellison, a pension law specialist who has been advising the Maxwell Private Companies Pension Fund Members' Association, found the Italian case by chance when flicking through European Court reports. It led Mr Ellison, of Ellison Westhorpe, to the directive which obliges governments to ensure that arrangements are made to compensate the workers of companies which become insolvent. 'It's there in words of one syllable. Provision has to be made for the protection of pension benefits of employees and former employees,' said Mr Ellison who has already got a preliminary counsel's opinion on the issue. Mr Ellison believes that the directive should give members of the private Maxwell companies' pension funds the right to sue the government for compensation if the companies become insolvent. Last month it was announced that four pension funds representing more than 4,000 pensioners and employees of AGB Research were being wound up. Little money is likely to be left for those who are not already pensioners. While operating AGB businesses are being sold off by the administrator the main company, which retains the pension fund liabilities, is likely to become insolvent. The British government argues that the directive which protects three months redundancy pay only applies to the last three months pension contributions. Mr Ellison argues that the directive says nothing of the sort and is advising his clients to test the issue in the High court. 'Some cases are iffy. I think this is a strong case,' Mr Ellison said last night.</p>

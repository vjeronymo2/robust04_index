			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Survey of Derivatives (1): Moving on to centre stage - The development of derivatives business has become the most important strategic goal of the 1990s for banks and securities houses with global ambitions. Tracy Corrigan examines one of the most dynamic growth areas in financial markets ONLY three years into the decade, the 1990s are already being dubbed the decade of derivatives. Virtually all banks, securities houses and other financial institutions with international ambitions have identified the derivatives market as a crucial strategic area. Non-financial companies are making increasing use of derivatives to hedge their exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate fluctuations. Slower off the mark, institutional investors are also starting to warm to derivative instruments, which can be particularly useful for asset allocation. At the same time, the new emphasis on derivatives is having a strong impact on other areas within the banking and securities business, fuelling, for example, advances in technology, and causing banks to reassess their attitudes to risk. 'The strategic question to ask about any bank right now is: have they embraced derivatives? And if not, have they found anything else to embrace instead?' says one analyst. The market has already come through a period of rapid development. The notional amount of futures contracts traded annually on the world 's exchanges is around Dollars 140,000bn, while the notional amount of over-the-counter swaps outstanding is about Dollars 4,500bn. Futures and options listed on exchanges are standardised contracts, based on an underlying market, which are traded on and cleared through an exchange. Over-the-counter products, such as swaps and options, can be tailored to suit a particular user's needs, and are bilateral agreements between two separate counterparties. There are now liquid futures contracts based on most of the world's large stock and bond markets. In some cases, the futures markets are more actively traded than the underlying instruments on which they are based. New markets are still developing in Asia and Latin America, but in the US, and to a lesser extent in Europe, futures exchanges are already highly developed. 'The real emphasis has to be on organic growth,' said Mr Daniel Hodson, chief executive of the London International Financial Futures Exchange, who admits that after establishing a range of European products over the past 10 years the universe of potentially active new contracts has shrunk. Futures exchanges are now trying to adapt products from the over-the-counter market, so that they can offer standardised contracts which have some of the flexibility of the OTC market. For example, the Chicago Board Options Exchange's flex options, which allow standard contracts to be adjusted to suit individual needs, are being imitated by other US exchanges. The line between standardised contracts and highly customised OTC products has become blurred. 'Some would say we compete (with the exchanges) but I see a complementary relationship from which the financial markets benefit. Risks we take from our clients often flow back to the exchanges,' says Mr Joseph Bauman, head of business development, global derivatives, at Citibank, and chairman of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA), the over-the-counter market's trade association. Industry experts believe there is room for further growth, especially in the less mature over-the-counter market. 'If you look at the compound annual growth rates of notional principal volume (in swaps) - 35 per cent per annum for the past three or four years - it's hard to foresee this pace continuing forever, but growth rates will stay high because the community of users continues to expand,' said Mr Bauman of Citibank. Many market participants are confident because they believe that, particularly outside the US, only a small portion of the potential base of fund managers and corporate treasurers has so far been tapped. 'It's like being a car manufacturer, at a time when only 5 per cent of the population has learned to drive,' said one specialist. But there is no doubt that the market is becoming increasingly competitive, and products which were once at the cutting edge are now widely available, and at tighter margins. 'The pace of innovation will remain high as dealers continue to devote a large amount of resources to new products,' predicts Mr Patrick de Saint-Aignan, chairman of Morgan Stanley SA in Paris, and a senior member of the Group of Thirty committee which recently reported on the derivatives market. 'This is an activity where the dealers have a solution-oriented approach rather than trying to push standardised products.' One reason for this is that banks can charge higher fees for innovative products, particularly when they have stolen the march on their competitors temporarily. 'The rate of growth is slowing but the base it is growing from is getting bigger,' said Mr Malcolm Basing, president of SBC Canada and a former chairman of ISDA. However, he identifies a number of areas where growth potential remains strong, such as commodity swaps and perhaps insurance or credit derivatives. As well as fending off competitors, the derivatives industry has also come under attack from regulators, who are concerned about the speed of the market's growth and about potential systemic risk to the banking system. However, a number of reports this year, for example from the Bank of England, have adopted a more conciliatory tone. 'I would not characterise what they (the regulators) have done as backing off. They have taken a major look at derivative activities over the past year and there has been a tempering of the rhetoric that characterised early 1992,' said Mr Bauman. The Group of Thirty report on derivatives published earlier this year set out detailed guidelines on how to manage the risks involved. 'We are still very much under a regulatory glare, but we have convinced them it's a worthwhile business and that it can be managed effectively,' said Mr Basing. 'We still have to convince them that it is possible for controls to be put in place by smaller players down the line which may have fewer resources.' However, the much lamented regulatory scrutiny has undoubtedly had some positive effects. First of all, it has concentrated the attention of bankers at board level, some of whom had risen through the ranks in a pre-derivatives era. Second, the development of risk management techniques for derivatives has in many cases been applied to other areas of banking. 'There has been a real awakening to the need to manage risk throughout an institution,' said Mr Paul Reyniers, the Coopers &amp; Lybrand partner in charge of global risk management. 'If they (banks) can manage risk they have the key tool for capital allocation.' While the continued growth of the market seems certain, it is more difficult to predict the technological changes which will accompany its development. Although the technology of futures trading systems has already advanced substantially, many traders say that no electronic system yet replicates conditions in a trading pit. However, many traders do believe that electronic trading of some sort will be an increasingly inherent part of the derivatives market in years to come. Globex, the 24-hour futures trading system jointly developed by Reuters the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade, is yet to establish itself as a global network for trading outside normal exchange hours. But if CME chairman Mr Jack Sandner's vision of 'a global trading village' is eventually realised, it could prove a vehicle for a further net increase in trading volume.</p>

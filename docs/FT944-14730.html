			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / GM's recovery held back by production strains The recovery at General Motors, a symbol of US manufacturing industry's turnround in the 1990s, stalled in recent months, according to figures released yesterday. Two strikes in North America, delays in launching new vehicles and a production system that was straining to cope with demand were behind the company's difficulties. The news was contained in third-quarter figures released yesterday, and wiped more than 5 per cent, or some Dollars 2bn, off GM's market value. Mr Jack Smith, president and chief executive, said: 'We are not satisfied with out overall performance in the third quarter, and we continue to recognise the need for further improvement.' He added that there would continue to be 'ups and downs' in GM's recovery, but that higher sales and the launch of more profitable models would support higher profits in future. Despite the disappointment, GM's figures yesterday demonstrated the extent of the turnround in its core North American car and truck businesses. It lost Dollars 328.4m in what is traditionally the weakest three-month period in the year, an improvement of about Dollars 500m compared with the same period in 1993. The company said two strikes over the summer cost it Dollars 140m, as autoworkers vented their frustration at GM's refusal to hire more staff to cope with higher production levels. The increase in vehicle sales in North America, which were 90,000 higher than a year before, also caused overtime costs to jump and forced GM to pay premium rates to ship parts by air in some cases to keep production lines running. Analysts said the strains in the GM production system demonstrated how far it still needed to go to compete with its more efficient US rivals, Ford and Chrysler. GM's international business, which has been the star performer of its operations in recent years, recorded a 60 per cent drop in profits, to Dollars 240m, despite a 5 per cent increase in sales. GM said it was now paying taxes in some European countries for the first time. Analysts said the launch of the Corsa, a small car with lower profit margins, had also dampened profitability in Europe. Total net income of Dollars 552m, which compared with a loss of Dollars 113m in the 1993 quarter, was buoyed by Dollars 200m in one-off tax benefits, along with big gains at its computer services subsidiary, EDS, and its financing arm, GMAC. Earnings per share were 40 cents.</p>

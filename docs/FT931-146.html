			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Daimler-Benz to list in Singapore and Shanghai after US DAIMLER-BENZ intends next year to seek a stock-exchange listing of its shares in Singapore, and possibly Shanghai, after reaching agreement with US authorities about a listing in New York. The plans for the listings were revealed in New York yesterday at a press conference to announce Daimler's compromise with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr Gerhard Liener, the group's finance director, said that the agreement on accounting standards with the US authorities would lead directly to listings of its stock on other exchanges worldwide. Daimler shares are already traded in Tokyo. Mr Liener said yesterday that the listing in New York would not be coupled with the issue of new stock. Daimler's long-awaited rights issue would come 'probably next year', he said. Daimler had intended to hold a DM2bn (Pounds 800m) rights issue in the autumn of last year but this was postponed due to the poor state of the stock market. Mr Liener said yesterday that Daimler's net profit for 1991 would be 'just under' DM1.5bn after DM1.9bn in 1991. This is in line with analysts' expectations and reflects a sharp downturn in the group's core automobile market. Full details are to be released next week. Mr Liener said that turnover for 1992 would be DM98.5bn, up from DM95.01 in 1991. The dividend is to be maintained at 1991's DM13 per share. The deal with the SEC means that Daimler's group accounts will in future be produced accounting to US generally accepted accounting practice (GAAP). This will mean common standards of valuation applied throughout the group, and greater disclosure in areas such as cash flow statements. Preparations for the listing in Shanghai's fledgling markets are at an early stage but the intention underscores German industry's growing interest in China. Daimler is considering opening a bus assembly factory near Shanghai and setting up a joint venture with a local company to make rolling stock for underground railways. AEG, Daimler's electrical's subsidiary, is leader of a German consortium which has built the first 14km of an underground railway for Shanghai. If Daimler joins the Shanghai stock exchange it will be sharing the register with companies such as No. 1 Pencil, Fridge Compressor and Rubber Belt, Tony Walker writes from Peking. The exchange has a reputation as a roller coaster. In mid-1992 the B-share index, the exchange's 10 dollar-denominated shares available to foreigners, dropped 50 per cent before recovering some ground. Last week, it dropped 5 per cent, before rebounding. Blazing a trail, page 28 Another two senior executives have quit Volkswagen, the German car group which is Europe's leading vehicle maker, writes Christopher Parkes in Frankfurt. Mr Hans-Jorg Hungerland, a director in charge of world distribution of VW brand vehicles, and Mr William Young, president of Volkswagen of America, both left at their own request, the company said yesterday. The moves follow the departure of three group main board directors and the arrival of General Motors' former head of procurement, Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hebron, West Bank, Feb 25 (AFP) -- A lone Israeli  settler gunned down 18 Palestinians and wounded dozens more  Friday [25 February] at the Tomb of the Patriarchs in the  occupied West Bank City of Hebron, military officials and  doctors said.    The man then turned the gun on himself and committed  suicide.    One Hebron doctor said 16 Palestinians were certified dead  in  a Hebron hospital and another two in a hospital in east  Jerusalem. More than 70 other were wounded.    The killer apparently disguised himself in an Israeli Army  uniform before opening up with an automatic rifle on the Moslem  faithful who turned out in large numbers for Friday prayers  during the fasting month of Ramadan.    The army imposed a curfew on Hebron and closed off the area  of the Tomb, which is holy to Jews and Moslems alike and crowded  every morning. Scuffles broke out in the complex on Thursday  evening as Israelis celebrated the start of Purim, a holiday  marking the deliverance of Jews from a massacre in Persia.    Police Minister Moshe Shahal condemned the slaughter.    "I condemn in the strongest possible way these murders,  whatever the nationality of the person who committed them," he  said.    Palestinian militants declared a strike on the Gaza Strip in  memory of the dead and the Koran, the Moslem holy book, was read  out in the mosques, a correspondent reported.    It was the worst killing ever by Jewish settlers, who in  July  1983 shot dead four Palestinian students in Hebron. Border  police shot dead 20 Palestinians on Temple Mount in the Old City  of Jerusalem in October 1990.    The Tomb complex, which houses a mosque, fell under Israeli  control in the 1967 Middle East war and has since been shared by  the two religions.    Hebron has always been one of the tensest of Palestinian  towns where 500 Jews live among 70,000 Arabs. Another 5,000  Jews live in the adjacent settlement of Qiryat Arba'.    In Hebron, Palestinian protestors smashed an AFP  photographer's car with rocks.    Before Friday's killings, 1,180 Palestinians had died from  Israeli bullets since the intifadah or uprising began in  December 1987. Over the same period 203 Israelis have been  killed by Palestinians.    An anonymous telephone caller to AFP in Jerusalem claimed  responsibility for the killing in the name Jewish extremists.    The caller said the massacre was to avenge the December 6  shooting by Islamic fundamentalists of an Israeli settler and  his son, Mordekhay and Shalom Lapid, in Hebron.    The caller said he represented the "Zealots of the God of  Israel", an unknown group.    An AFP photographer reported that violent clashes erupted in  Hebron between Palestinians and soldiers who had opened fire.    At the city's Al-Ahli hospital dead bodies were still  arriving.    "The dead and wounded are still being brought in," said  photographer Patrick Baz. "A small child was just brought in  dead from bullet wounds. He was wrapped in a blood-stained  blanket."</p>

			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / International Company News: British Gas reviewing oil and gas holding Bow Valley Energy, the Calgary-based oil and gas producer, said yesterday British Gas was reviewing its 53 per cent stake in the company. British Gas played down the announcement, saying the exercise is part of an overall review of its international operations. However, Bow Valley said it had supplied confidential information on its operations to not only to Britis Gas, but also to unspecified third parties. Bow Valley said British Gas had made no decision as to whether to dispose of its investment, which at current market prices, is worth about CDollars 580m (USDollars 433m). Mr Duncan Mathieson, analyst at Wood Gundy in Toronto, said a management shake-up over the past two years had given Bow Valley 'good focus and good direction'. The company, whose operations are centred on western Canada, the North Sea and Indonesia, posted net earnings of CDollars 7.4m last year on revenues of CDollars 243m. It produces about 24,000 barrels of oil and 162m cubic feet of gas a day.</p>

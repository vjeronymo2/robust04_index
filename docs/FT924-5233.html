			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / International Company News: Ferfin chief goes in Ferruzzi management shake-up THE Ferruzzi family yesterday announced a management shake-up giving it full operational control of its agro-industrial, chemicals and energy group, Italy's second-largest private empire. The central element in the change is the departure of Mr Giuseppe Garofano as chief executive officer of Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin), the family's controlling company, and president of Montedison, the main subsidiary. Mr Arturo Ferruzzi, already head of Ferfin, will become chairman of Montedison, and Mr Carlo Sama, his brother-in-law and vice-chairman of Ferfin, will become chief executive officer of Montedison. The two companies will thus have the same senior management structure and personnel with effect from January 1993, headed by Mr Arturo Ferruzzi and run by Mr Sama. The change has been agreed amicably with Mr Garofano, who was promoted from the management of Montedison in November 1990 to steer the family group after the acrimonious departure of Mr Raul Gardini, who had married one of Arturo Ferruzzi's three sisters. 'This step has been agreed with the shareholders for some time,' Mr Garofano said yesterday. He underlined it was an opportune moment to step aside following the group's outline agreement on a major plastics joint venture with Shell in September. Mr Garofano has had the difficult task of rationalising the aggressive expansion of Ferruzzi-Montedison under Mr Gardini's leadership. This year's first-half results for Montedison saw the group move into a loss of L188bn (Dollars 136m) against net profits of L108bn in the same period in 1991. Mr Garofano will be retained in a consultant's role with Ferruzzi and will remain on the Montedison board and as vice-president of Ferfin. Aged 49, Mr Garofano is now likely to be free to play a major role in the Italian government's forthcoming programme of privatisation.</p>

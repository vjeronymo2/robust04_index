			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHERE TO TAKE THE PLUNGE  </P> <P> Diving essentials: About 15 local dive shops make regular trips to Stingray  City and Sandbar. Two reputable shops are Bob Soto's Diving Ltd. (800-262-7686  or, in Cayman, 809-949-2022), which arranges the Desert Divers' stingray dive,  and Don Foster's Dive Grand Cayman (800-833-4837 or 809-949-5679). Make  reservations for stingray dives; they are crowded and do not leave every day.  Many dive shops also offer snorkeling excursions for $25. Diving is year-round,  and a wet suit is unnecessary since the water temperature is about 80 degrees.  </P> <P> Individuals can arrange their own stingray dives. All rental equipment is  available, with regulators and buoyancy compensators costing about $10 each and  masks, fins and snorkels about $7.50.  </P> <P> Getting around: Living in Cayman is expensive but there are ways to economize.  For starters, rent a car. Compact cars cost about $150 a week and while mopeds  are available, they are risky. Most streets have no shoulders and mopeds take a  back seat to anything with four wheels. With cars, the only thing to master is  driving on the left side of the road.  </P> <P> Where to stay: Hotels range from standard ($75 minimum) to deluxe ($150 to $200  high season, Dec. 15 to April 15; $125-$150 off-season).  </P> <P> Standard accommodations can be found at the Cayman Islander, West Bay Road,  Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands, (800) 262-7686, and the Sunset House, Box 479,  Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands, (800) 854-4767 or (809) 949-7111.  </P> <P> Some top-of-the-line hotels include the Hyatt Brittania, Holiday Inn, Seven  Mile Beach, Grand Cayman and British West Indies.  </P> <P> If you're traveling with friends, condominiums are a way to save. Two-bedroom  condos that sleep four go for $150-$200 a night. One-bedrooms cost about $100.  For reservations, call Grand Cayman Reservations at (800) 327-8777 or  Hospitality World of Grand Cayman at (800) 232-1034.  </P> <P> For more information: Contact the Cayman Islands Department of Tourism, 3440  Wilshire Blvd., Suite 1202, Los Angeles 90010, (213) 738-1969.

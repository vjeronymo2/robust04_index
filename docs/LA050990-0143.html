			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> NEW YORK;  </P> <P> COLUMNIST BRESLIN SUSPENDED FOR TIRADE  </P> <P> Newsday said it suspended columnist Jimmy Breslin for two weeks without pay for  racial and sexual insults against a reporter of Korean descent.  </P> <P> "Last Friday's outburst by Jimmy Breslin was ugly and outrageous and I'm sorry  that it took place," New York Newsday editor Don Forst said in a statement.  Breslin had launched into a tirade in the newsroom after reporter Ji-Yeon Mary  Yuh, 25, criticized his May 3 column as sexist in an internal computer message.  The 61-year-old Pulitzer Prize-winning writer later apologized to the staff.  </P></p>

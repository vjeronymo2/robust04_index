			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Carol Black and Neal Marlens, the couple behind ABC's Emmy-winning series "The  Wonder Years," will be stepping down as executive producers at the end of this  season. They will turn over the reins to Bob Brush, currently co-executive  producer. Marlens and Black plan "to take a rest" and pursue feature film and  TV projects. Staff writer Dave Stern acknowledged that the impending change has  "rattled the chemistry a bit" behind the scenes, but expects that Brush and the  staff will maintain the show's integrity. "They are the ones who created these  characters, and we're not going to do much to change the show," he said. "There  will just be a new man in charge." ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / World Trade News: US renews calls for Japan to open car market JAPAN came under renewed pressure from the US yesterday to expand access for foreign-made cars and car parts by setting targets that would serve as a measure of progress in opening its markets. In the first of a series of negotiations on the vehicle trade, the US presented Japan with specific proposals. US and Japanese officials declined to specify what these were, but there were suggestions the US proposals on measurable targets would not be acceptable to the Japanese. A senior Japanese official said the US plans 'go beyond the scope and ability of the government' and called for 'excessive intervention by the government in private business'. The Japanese government believed quantitative targets ran counter to the principle of a free market and could not promise that the targets would be met, the official said. 'In the end it is the consumer that makes the choice,' he said. Japan proposed that objective criteria to assess progress in market access could include marketing efforts by foreign parts suppliers, attempts made to build up after-service networks and the overall competitiveness of the industry. Foreign carmakers' product development efforts to meet Japanese consumers' preferences and attempts to build up dealerships and sales could also be assessed. The calls on Japan to set quantifiable targets were not restricted to US government officials. They were supported by representatives of the big three US carmakers in Japan for the Tokyo motor show. Mr Robert Lutz, president and chief operating officer of Chrysler, described the Japanese market as having 'vestiges of a fortress mentality,' and emphasised his support for 'firm targets to reduce the chronic bilateral trade imbalance between the US and Japan, and to open up the Japanese market once and for all'. Mr Lutz pointed to restrictive regulations, a distribution system that required the use of expensive middlemen, and high real estate prices as key factors which had kept the Japanese market closed to foreign carmakers. 'We should not be presented with an obscene financial hurdle just to be able to sell cars here,' Mr Lutz said. Despite years of talking, the situation had not improved significantly for foreign carmakers, which had only 2.2 per cent of the market, he noted. Without improving the imbalance in cars and car parts, which accounted for more than two-thirds of the US trade deficit with Japan, 'serious trade frictions between the US and Japan are all but inevitable.'</p>

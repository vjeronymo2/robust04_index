			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Venezuelan smelter plans on hold - The country's response to low aluminium prices VENEZUELA'S ambitious plans to expand its aluminium smelting capacity from the current level of 644,000 tonnes a year to more than 2m tonnes a year by the turn of the century have been stymied by world market conditions. Excess production and a flood of shipments from the cash-hungry former Soviet Union had forced prices to historic lows before they rallied last month. The situation looked particularly grim late last year after Alcoa and Austria Metall advised the Venezuelan government that they had decided to 'suspend' plans to invest in two aluminium smelters that would have added more than 330,000 tonnes to Venezuela's annual smelting capacity. In spite of this, the government of President Carlos Andres Perez and Venezuelan aluminium industry executives believe that some important smelting projects will be developed here over the short and medium term. 'I expect that the next one or two large international aluminium smelters will be built in Venezuela,' said Mr Miguel Rodriguez, Venezuela's minister of planning and chief strategist of its economic reform programme. Mr Rafael Rodriguez Pulido, president of Venezuela's oldest aluminium producer, Alcasa, commented: 'The Venezuelan aluminium industry is losing money because of the cyclical nature of the world aluminium industry. But this doesn't mean that the industry is a bad investment, especially here'. Two other projects to build large smelters, involving investors from Europe, Korea and the US, are still nominally alive but there has been no word on whether they will go ahead. However, Alcoa has taken pains to tell the Venezuelan government that its project is not dead and that it will be reviewed on a regular basis. Venezuela's state-controlled aluminium sector closed 1991 with mixed results. The country's two large smelters - Alcasa and Venalum - lost a total of about USDollars 89m last year. But Venezuela's bauxite mine, Bauxiven, last year increased production by 172 per cent to 2.1m tonnes, after years of delays in raising production levels. Interalumina, the country's producer of alumina (aluminium oxide), raised production capacity to 2m tonnes a year and said it would post a profit for 1991. Venalum, Venezuela's largest smelter, registered its first loss in 1991, of about Dollars 39m, while Alcasa, a profitable company since 1982, expects its 1991 losses to reach aboutDollars 50m. Venalum's red ink was due to lower world prices for primary aluminium, while Alcasa's deficit was caused by a combination of weak prices and high financing costs on its domestic debt. Venalum's equity is held by the Venezuelan government (80 per cent) and six Japanese companies (Showa Denko, Kobe Steel, Sumitomo Chemical, Mitsubishi Material, Mitsubishi Aluminium and Marubeni) which have a total of 20 per cent. Alcasa is 92.1 per cent owned by the Venezuelan government and 7.9 per cent by Reynolds International. Both companies are taking steps to improve their financial situations during 1992, including a variety of cost cutting measures. In Venalum's case, the company plans to reduce personnel by 24 per cent to about 3,100. Alcasa says it will raise efficiency at its plants and work out a plan to lower financing charges. Alcasa must work much harder than Venalum to improve production efficiency. The latter is a relatively new plant, having started production on the first of its five production lines in 1978. But three of Alcasa's four pot lines were put into production between 1967 and 1978 and are less efficient than newer lines. Despite adverse market conditions in 1991, Venezuelan smelters did not cut production significantly. Venalum, with installed smelting capacity of 430,000 tonnes a year, produced 395,600 of primary aluminium last year, down 0.04 per cent from 1990. Alcasa, with installed smelting capacity of 214,000 tonnes a year, produced an estimated 210,000 tonnes of primary aluminium, up 4 per cent from 1990. Alcasa also has 42,000 tonnes in rolling capacity for products. Venalum projects production of 401,000 tonnes this year, and Alcasa is aiming at at 220,000 tonnes. About 70 per cent of Venalum's production is exported to to Japan, while Alcasa exports 40 per cent of output to a variety of international clients. Both companies own shares in downstream aluminium producers outside Venezuela. Bauxiven, which is wholly-owned by the government, expects bauxite production this year to exceed 3.5m tonnes. Interalumina (owned 98.3 per cent by the Venezuelan government and 1.7 per cent by Alusuisse) says that output will depend on demand. Interalumina in the past has regularly produced at above its installed capacity. Critics of Venezuela's aluminium sector say that the two large smelters should have performed better last year, even in the face of weak prices. Alcasa and Venalum enjoy comparative advantages such as low-cost hydro-electic power and labour, plus supplies of alumina and bauxite from nearby sources. Industry officials say that they are working hard to make Venezuelan smelters more efficient. And, they note, the government eliminated export incentives in 1989-90, thus forcing Venalum and Alcasa to compete on real terms internationally. Executives at Venalum and Alcasa also point out that Venezuela still offers strong comparative advantages to aluminium companies. These include hydro-electric power at a cost ranking among the lowest worldwide; large deposits of high-grade bauxite plus the capacity to produce 2m tonnes of alumina a year; years of experience in smelting and in making aluminium products; a network of downstream aluminium users in Venezuela and overseas (in which Venezuelan smelters are equity partners); and a good location for reaching world markets. Mr Enrique Castells, former president of Venalum and now a management consultant on aluminium, said that the decline in aluminium prices 'is good for Venezuela' since it will force the sector 'to get into shape'. Moreover, rather than halting new spending on smelting capacity, he said, 'smart investors should be investing now in new plants'. 'The current price situation should force many high-cost producers out of the market, and new, low-cost smelters should be started now in order to take advantage of demand increases when the price cycle bottoms out'.</p>

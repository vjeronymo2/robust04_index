			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] In a wide-scale operation in the territories,  security forces have rounded up hundreds of Hamas [Islamic  Resistance Movement] activists and operatives. A number of  weapons were also confiscated in the sweep, which took place  last night. Alan Ben-'Ami reports:    [Begin Ben-'Ami recording] The authorities are being  tight-lipped about exactly how many people have been arrested  and who they are. But figures obtained from various sources,  including Palestinians in the territories, indicate that as many  as 400 or so people were detained in the round up. A terse  statement by the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] spokesman also said  that weapons and ammunition were uncovered during the raids on  towns, villages, and refugee camps in the West Bank and Gaza  Strip.    The massive crack-down is being viewed as a severe blow to  Hamas and its operations, at least temporarily. But security  sources point out that there are gunmen from the 'Izz-al-Din  al-Qassam gangs still at large, and they can be expected to  mount attacks of one sort or another, despite this wide-spread  move against Hamas members and operatives at various levels.  Certainly, this is the biggest operation against Hamas in the  territories since Israel deported more than 400 to Lebanon in  December 1992. An international outcry resulted and all the  deported being allowed to eventually return, and some of the  were among the men picked up in this new crack-down. Most of the  people arrested are said to be in their late teens or early  twenties, and to include a number who were directly involved  with planned terrorist attacks.    Hamas has openly boasted that its members were planning a  total of five attacks against Israelis, with two more still to  come, following the deadly bombs in 'Afula and Hadera and the ax  attack on a bus in Jerusalem. Seven Israelis have died and more  than 80 been injured in those attacks. A number of prominent  Hamas personalities, including Taysir Tamimi and Jamal  al-Natshah from Hebron, and Yasir Mansur from Nabulus are  amongst those arrested. The big wave of arrests follows raids  last week in which about 70 Hamas activists and operatives were  picked up. Security sources say more arrests can be expected in  the days ahead. [end recording]    Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin says the arrests of those  responsible for acts of terrorism will continue. Rabin appeared  today before the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee,  where he also said he supports a greater withdrawal from the  Golan heights than that being recommended by the Army. David  Ze'ev reports:    [Begin recording] [Ze'ev] As he left the Foreign Affairs  and Defense Committee, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin was asked  about the arrests of Hamas activists.    [Rabin] Let us put it this way: We will fight those who  continue terror with all the means that are available to us.  The only limitation is the limitation of the law.

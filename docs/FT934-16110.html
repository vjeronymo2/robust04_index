			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / States bring forward primary dates THE US presidential party primaries of 1996 promise to be less of a marathon as a result of action taken recently by several states bringing forward election dates. This week Governor Pete Wilson of California signed into law a bill setting the last Tuesday in March, rather than the first in June, as primary day. Last week Governor George Voinovich of Ohio did the same with a bill that would have his state vote on the third Tuesday in March, the same as Michigan and Illinois, rather than in mid-May. Wisconsin and Pennsylvania may follow suit. March now looms as a pivotal month, with in effect three regional primaries  -the south at the start of the month, the Midwest around the middle and California, the biggest state, in the west at the end. Mr Voinovich pointed out that presidential candidates make promises in primaries which may be redeemed if they get elected. 'Why should they spend all their time in New Hampshire and Iowa (which hold the first primaries and caucuses), when they're pea-pods in terms of electoral clout and population?' States with late primaries have indeed felt left out. California has not held a truly decisive primary since 1972. Experts are divided on the impact of shortening and front-loading the primary season. It may help the well-organised and well-financed, especially an incumbent. President George Bush, for example, would not have been as embarrassed for so long by the sniping attacks of Mr Patrick Buchanan, his right-wing challenger. But an unpopular front-runner or incumbent could get knocked out very early. Regional candidates from the south, like Messrs Carter and Clinton, will probably have less time to establish themselves nationally. But western hopefuls at least get an earlier crack at the biggest state of all, itself prone to populist appeals.</p>

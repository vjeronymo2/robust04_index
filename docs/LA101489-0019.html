			<p><P> October 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SANTA ANITA, HOLLYPARK ARE GETTING OFF TRACK  </P> <P> Del Mar's recent emergence as the leading race track in average daily handle,  surpassing Santa Anita, serves as an important lesson for the two local  thoroughbred venues.  </P> <P> Del Mar offers simulcast wagering at both its competitors' facilities.  Thoroughbred racing is therefore more accessible to Southlanders during the Del  Mar season than it is during the Santa Anita and Hollywood Park meets.  </P> <P> As the freeways become more and more congested, on-track attendance at both  these facilities has steadily declined. So far, the managements' response has  been to try to make up for this lost patronage by expanding the inter-track  wagering system to increasingly far-flung locations, such as Indio and  Lancaster. Wake up! Cactus plants and cows don't go to the races.  </P> <P> Isn't it about time Hollypark and Santa Anita worked out a reciprocal  simulcasting agreement, and started offering some form of true off-track (as  opposed to inter-track) betting?  </P> <P> WILLIAM CRAIG, Huntington Beach  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 5, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUR ENERGY DEBATE CAN'T RUN ON EMOTION;  </P> <P> IF WE WANT ALTERNATIVES, WE MUST KNOW RISKS  </P> <P> Like all industrialized nations, America runs on energy. An adequate supply at  a reasonable cost is essential if this nation is to maintain or improve its  current standard of living.  </P> <P> But energy, every form of it, has its price. Some costs are readily apparent.  One can calculate, based on the price of oil or coal, the cost per kilowatt of  electricity generated. Other costs are more difficult to calculate. For  example, the cost per kilowatt of electricity generated via nuclear energy  (fission) reflects less the cost of uranium than the need to comply with  complex and often expensive environmental safety regulations. In so far as  these measures are reasonable, they present an unavoidable expenditure.  However, regulations motivated by politics and/or emotion -- rather than  science -- are an unnecessary expense. Finally, we need to consider some energy  costs that are exceedingly difficult or impossible to estimate, such as the  effect of these technologies on the environment.  </P> <P> The United States, Europe and Japan, with about 20% of the world's population,  consume 80% of the world's energy. This disproportionate use of energy cannot  continue into the next century. As other nations evolve, they too will require  (and demand) their fair share of the world's energy resources. What will happen  then? One strategy could be for us to voluntarily decrease our energy  consumption. This seems exceedingly unlikely. Americans continue to use more,  not less, energy each year. Another possibility is a violent social upheaval  whereby these nations seize their "fair-share" of the world's energy resources.  Clearly this is not in our best interest. The third alternative is to increase  energy production. Few question that this strategy will prevail, but where will  this energy come from?  </P> <P> Coal is abundant and cheap. However, coal mining is dangerous and its burning  poses very substantial health hazards.  </P> <P> Oil, too, has many problems. It is a scarce resource and we depend heavily on  foreign supplies. This reliance can have profound economic and political  consequences. My greatest concerns, however, are the political costs of oil  dependence. It did not require many hours of waiting in line during the 1973  oil crisis for many Americans to begin to question our support of Israel. And  what about the nuclear risk of foreign oil dependence? It is possible to argue  that the likelihood of a conflict escalating into a major nuclear exchange is  greater if fought over the use of oil than over the use of nuclear energy.  </P> <P> Other forms of energy also must be considered, but some, such as hydroelectric  or wind, are inadequate for global needs. Solar energy is a popular  alternative. However, it is also currently inadequate, and present technologies  result in a loss of lives and production of toxic wastes of comparable or  greater magnitude as nuclear energy. Recent reports of a breakthrough in the  cold fusion process of producing energy are of interest, but fusion is  inherently more unstable than fission and practical applications are at best  decades away.  </P> <P> What, then, should we think of nuclear energy? It, too, has substantial  advantages and problems. It is potentially abundant. It could be cheap but  isn't, primarily because of errors made by the industry and by regulatory  agencies. Nuclear energy also carries the risk of accidents, like Chernobyl,  and disposal of radioactive wastes. These problems should be technically  solvable but are too heavily politicized for serious progress.  </P> <P> This brings us to two recent issues. One is the defeat of a Los Angeles  proposition by Occidental Petroleum to drill for oil in California; the second,  the planned dismantling of the newly licensed Shoreham nuclear power station in  New York. Americans must be willing to pay the price for energy. If we stop  using nuclear energy, we must accept the risks of oil exploration or changes in  the environment of the planet that may result from burning fossil fuels. We  must understand that simply voting against every energy proposal will not  result in a sensible energy strategy.  </P> <P> Many people were surprised when George Bush, during the second presidential  campaign debate, mentioned that he thought safe nuclear energy might have a  role in the nation's energy future. However, this seems to me a reasonable  attitude. In contrast, I do not agree with recent decisions regarding the  Shoreham reactor or the Seabrook nuclear facility in New Hampshire. These  decisions seem to have been motivated more by political considerations or  naivete than by a scholarly assessment of the potential risks. For example,  while it is probably true that Long Island or Boston could not be rapidly  evacuated, it is also clear that no possible accident scenario would make such  an evacuation desirable. Also, consider that at Chernobyl, for which the  Soviets were totally unprepared, evacuation of the local town of 45,000 persons  was accomplished in four hours, once the decision was made.  </P> <P> It's time to get serious about energy. The United States has drifted for too  long without a cogent, long-term energy policy. I am not necessarily suggesting  people support offshore oil drilling (a crazy stance just after the Exxon  Valdez fiasco) or more nuclear power plants. But they should think carefully  about the alternatives. If the Bush Administration is to be successful in  developing a comprehensive energy policy that will serve the United States into  the next century, it will need the support of an informed, rational electorate.  </P> <P> Although crudites and sushi are popular today, I doubt Americans will be happy  with less energy.  </P></p>

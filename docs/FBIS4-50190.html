			<p>BFN     [Text] Guangzhou, May 16 (CNS) -- Guangzhou decided to  thoroughly change the management mechanism for state-owned  enterprises by means of transformation of the property rights  and attraction of foreign investment. A total of 50 enterprises  which were suffering from a great loss were recently chosen for  a trial practice for the restructuring. A two-year period is  also set for the handling of property rights for a great number  of enterprises.    State-owned enterprises in Guangzhou saw each item suffer  from a loss of RMB 3 billion. [sentence as received] The  number of industrial enterprises which registered a loss within  the budget was nearly 36 percent of the total last year which  was far beyond the government expectation.    The measures for a solution to the loss made by state-owned  enterprises will be centred on the transfer of shares of the  large enterprises or group and in introduction of foreign  capital, technology, the market and management. Enterprises in  the red which are situated in prime sections in particular will  make way for the development of real estate. Proceeds resulting  from the real estate will be used to pay debt owed by those  enterprises. The municipal government has asked foreign trade  department for helping these enterprises to bring in foreign  capital for exploitation of the real estate.    Guangzhou will also make great effort in re-organizing the  capital pattern of state-owned enterprises for diversification  of investment and for popularity of the property rights.  Involvement of foreign investment in the shareholding practice,  employment of the shareholding system in enterprises and auction  carried out for enterprises in serious loss are all aimed at  making enterprises meet the market economy while at the same  time the unlimited liability for enterprises held by the state  had also to be changed. Enterprises were generally shifted into  limited liability companies, a move to make enterprises have  civil liability for the management of their property.  [paragraph as received]</p>

			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Internal inquiry at Richmond RICHMOND OIL &amp; Gas, the natural resources company which finds itself at the centre of a Serious Fraud Office inquiry into irregular share dealings, has launched an internal investigation into the underwriting arrangements for its 1989 flotation. Mr Terry Steele, a non-executive director appointed in January 1991, said that possible changes to the board had been discussed, but any decision would depend on the outcome of the internal inquiry. He hoped to 'hear some comment internally' on the company's own inquiry before the weekend. A full board meeting is scheduled for August 5. Mr Steele said a statement would be made by Mr Robert Fox, chairman, when the internal inquiry was completed. An investigation by Price Waterhouse, reported in the Financial Times earlier this week, cited evidence for what appeared to be a circle of funds in the July 1989 flotation. The accountancy firm suggested that the cash circle was used to give the impression that the sub-underwriting for Richmond's offer had been fully financed. Mr David Wilkinson, then chairman and now joint managing director of Richmond, said before the article appeared that he had been unaware of any such circle. Mr Steele said Richmond had contacted the SFO several weeks ago regarding its investigation, which was prompted by the Price Waterhouse report.</p>

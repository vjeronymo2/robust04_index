Leonid Kravchuk confirmed his intention  not to take part in the presidential elections. He will stand  up in the parliament for their postponement. The president  expressed a hope that the new Supreme Council would support him.  "This is not just my opinion. Dozens of local councils,  hundreds of labor collectives, and some political parties spoke  in favor of postponing the elections," stressed the head of the  Ukrainian state.    Touching upon the further operation of the Chernobyl Atomic  Electric Power Plant, the president pointed out: All conditions  have been created for its normal work. There can be no question  of closing it down now because, first, there are no funds for  that and, second, Ukraine has found itself in an energy crisis.</p>

			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Confusion reigns in UK-Malaysian row: British businessmen are standing on the sidelines in a quandary There are plenty of confused people about in Kuala Lumpur these days. Confused British business people wondering if they are ever going to win another contract in Malaysia; confused diplomats trying to analyse every Malaysian government move; confused locals wondering why Britain has been turned suddenly from friend to enemy. Two weeks ago, Malaysia proclaimed its disgust about what it called the patronising attitude and innuendoes of the British media. Dr Mahathir Mohamed, Malaysia's prime minister, was particularly upset about a report in the London Sunday Times alleging he had been involved in seeking payments from a British company. The dark clouds of Dr Mahathir's anger burst on British business. The Malaysians said that until the British media mended its ways, no government contracts would be awarded to British companies: a potential loss, said the Malaysians, of Pounds 4bn to those companies. In the latest move, Najib Tun Razak, Malaysia's defence minister, has said Malaysia wants the British government to make a clear statement dissociating itself from the 'baseless allegations in the British press'. Like two not very distinguished actors, both Malaysia and Britain have stumbled round the issue over the past two weeks. At this stage, few are predicting an early end to what has become a messy political and commercial quarrel. The initial Malaysian government statement reflected not only intense anger with the British media but also a Malaysian desire to have its considerable economic achievements recognised. 'We believe the foreign media must learn the fact that many developing countries, including a country led by a brown Moslem, have the ability to manage their own affairs successfully' the Malaysian statement said. What Dr Mahathir and his cabinet did not say was precisely what was required. 'I don't want an apology either from the British government or the British media,' said Dr Mahathir. 'All I want is the truth. But then the British media is incapable of telling the truth.' London's reaction has only added to the confusion. On one hand, Prime Minister John Major called the Malaysian action shortsighted and not remotely justified. On the other, one of Mr Major's ministers launched a stinging attack on what he called the bombast of the British media, and said Dr Mahathir's government was entitled to fair and accurate reporting. Meanwhile, business people have stood on the sidelines, in a quandary about what to do. The stridency of the initial statement from Kuala Lumpur encouraged officials and local business, anxious to show their loyalty to Dr Mahathir, to talk of severing all contacts with Britain. The Malaysian government became alarmed; its international image might suffer if the situation got out of control. Britain could claim that the Malaysians' actions infringed Gatt regulations. There could be retaliatory action by the European Union. Kuala Lumpur issued a statement clarifying matters: Malaysian students, contrary to announcements by senior officials, would still go to Britain. Private-sector business contacts would carry on as before. Dr Mahathir uses the term Malaysia Inc and the line between public and private business is very blurred. A big British power company, in partnership with a Malaysian concern, is tendering for multi-million-pound contracts with Tenaga Nasional, the semi-privatised electricity utility. 'We really don't know where we are,' the company's regional head declared. 'Is Tenaga considered public or private? We're confused and so are our partners. We've received no official notification of what we should do. It's all very frustrating.' There have been signs of the fog clearing around the issue. A delegation of British business leaders, including Lord Prior, chairman of the British GEC group and a former cabinet minister, was in Kuala Lumpur earlier this week seeing Dr Mahathir. Various formulas for an end to the Malaysian ban are being discussed. Reports in Kuala Lumpur suggest Dr Mahathir wants Mr Major's government to make a formal statement distancing itself from the British media reports on Malaysia. But Mr Major might not wish to take such a stand and risk being accused of giving in to what some in Britain see as Dr Mahathir's unreasonable demands. Mr Major also does not have the relationship with Dr Mahathir built up by Lady Thatcher, his predecessor. Much media attention in Britain is now focused on a parliamentary inquiry into allegations that aid to Malaysia was linked to the sale of Pounds 1.3bn-worth of British arms. The present row might be patched up by some deft diplomatic footwork. But whether the British media will in future report what Dr Mahathir considers to be the truth is another question.</p>

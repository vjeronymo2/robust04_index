			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Survey of Zambia (2): Copper industry decision is crucial - ZCCM's privatisation must create an export platform for a competitive economy The fate, not just of economic reform, but indeed of the entire Zambian economy rests on a single, crucial decision - the restructuring of the copper industry. 'If we get this one wrong', says a top official 'we will impoverish our people for another 25 years'. He is not exaggerating. Impressive progress in balancing the budget, slowing inflation, stabilising the exchange rate and bringing down interest rates, will count for little if the dynamo of the economy is not privatised in a manner that restores investment confidence, at home and abroad, and creates an export platform for a competitive economy in the 21st century. In recent weeks, a heated public debate has opened up, with the focus shifting from whether to how the copper-mining parastatal, ZCCM, should be privatised. This in itself is an important advance, although the decision to appoint an in-house government committee, including senior ZCCM personnel, to resolve the debate that has split the cabinet and the country could mean continuing procrastination, which is just what the economy cannot afford. Some see a gathering consensus centred on three principles - early privatisation; partial unbundling of ZCCM, although not to the extent recommended by the German consultants; and treating the Dollars 600m Konkola project as a separate entity. Last weekend's dismissal of deputy minister of mines, Mr Mathias Mpande, an outspoken protagonist of unbundling, indicates the depth of feeling on the subject. Unfortunately, some Zambian politicians and officials seem reluctant to acknowledge that whatever formula they develop will fly only if at least some of the big-league mining players - Anglo American, RTZ, BHP, Phelps-Dodge and Gencor - accept its viability. Zambian policymakers who have courageously put their fate in the hands of the markets in respect of interest and exchange rates, need to accept that the same discipline will apply to copper privatisation. African economies undergoing structural adjustment have to deal with a 'soft man' World Bank focusing on longer-term structural issues, and a 'hard man' IMF zeroing in on the more immediate problems of macroeconomic stabilisation. Invariably, they find it much harder to satisfy the Fund than the Bank. Zambia is different; it has made remarkable progress, especially in the past year, towards restoring macroeconomic balance, but it is lagging badly on the structural side. Arguably the single most important component of reform  -even more so than exchange control abolition - has been cash budgeting in the civil service. Provided it meets IMF benchmarks at the end of the year, which should be possible, it will become the third country - after Bolivia and Peru  - to complete a so-called Rights Accumulation Programme (Rap) - allowing it effectively to reschedule some Dollars 1.2bn in arrears owed to the Fund into a long-term loan at concessional rates. An IMF team will visit Lusaka next month to start negotiations for an Extended Structural Adjustment Facility (Esaf) signalling the successful completion of the Rap. Fund officials praise the Zambians for achieving what three years ago seemed a pipe-dream. Structural reform is a different ball game. The World Bank is presently assessing Lusaka's track record in satisfying six benchmarks, amid some anxiety that a critical report could mean a slowdown in donor disbursements next year: land reform, currently mired in deep political controversy, an 'Ethics Bill' to stamp out corruption, social dimension spending targets in health and education, privatisation (excluding ZCCM), civil service reform, and, most immediately, resolving the crisis at state-owned Zambia Airways. The government says it will close the airline, losing some Dollars 2m monthly, by the end of the year, replacing it with a privately-owned carrier. The logistics of this are still unclear, with some in government insisting that a national airline operating inter-continental flights must be retained, rather than a downsized, local and regional carrier. Civil service reform is stalled, partly, officials say, because the necessary downsizing which would enable the government to compete for scarce skills by paying market-level salaries, would blow the budget. Privatisation is beginning to gather momentum with the recent sale of two sizeable state companies - Zambian Breweries and Chilanga Cement - and the promise by Mr Ronald Penza, finance minister, to close the state holding company, Zimco, this year. None of these hard-core political economy issues will be easy to resolve. The good news is that, after years of mounting unemployment and declining living standards, the fall in inflation and interest rates and the stabilisation of the exchange rate has given the government some real ammunition to use against its critics. So much so, in fact, that Mr Dominic Mulaisho, governor of the Bank of Zambia, is emphatic that the reform programme really is irreversible. 'We are beginning to develop a political constituency for economic rationality' he says. Not that new-found macroeconomic stability can be taken for granted; despite the steep fall in inflation to a forecast 30 per cent in 1994 from 187 per cent last year, the real exchange rate has been appreciating this year and an adjustment is probable before too much longer. At K675 to the dollar, the Kwacha is probably some 10-15 per cent overvalued, and resumed Kwacha depreciation is likely late this year or early in 1995. Bankers expect yields on 91-day Treasury Bills down to 29 per cent from 120 per cent six months ago, to fall further, before levelling out at a premium of 5-10 per cent above the inflation rate. Officials confess that the precise relationship between inflation and interest rates and the exchange rate - the Zambia risk premium - is unpredictable. What matters, though, is that the markets are calling the shots, so that a re-run of the 1991 debacle when the Kaunda government tried to spend its way back into office, with disastrous consequences for inflation and the kwacha, is unlikely. The abolition of exchange controls (with very minor, technical exceptions) means that if public spending and monetary expansion were to veer off course in the run-up to the 1996 elections, the kwacha and interest rates would respond - negatively and quickly, undermining what arguably will be the government's main electoral platform - the restoration of economic stability. In the words of one economist: 'The market vote will be the one that counts'. The market vote is evident, too, in investment. The Bank of Zambia's opinion survey of some 200 companies shows a 'decisive' turn for the better in business and investor sentiment, but the recovery will be slow given the poor infrastructure, high real interest rates and the scarcity of long-term capital. Skills and institutional capacity are important constraints too, and the country is heavily and unhealthily dependent on donor assistance and expatriates. Partly because the civil service is poorly rewarded, few of the brightest and best Zambians work for government, while many have found greener employment pastures as international civil servants. Zambia clearly has an international competitive advantage in mining and agriculture. The resumed interest in mineral exploration - Rio Tinto, JCI, Gencor, Anglo American, BHP, and Phelps Dodge of the US - is a bullish development, underscoring the importance of ZCCM privatisation as a vehicle for drawing substantial new foreign participation into the Zambian economy. It has enormous agricultural potential, too, in terms of unused land, good soils and a better climate than neighbouring Zimbabwe. Development has been constrained by misguided pricing and marketing policies, land ownership restrictions, infrastructural deterioration and, recently, record interest rates that have created a serious farm debt problem. Vociferous manufacturers blame some elements of the reform programme - especially trade and interest rate liberalisation - for these difficulties. While the terms of trade have shifted against import substitution activities, some of which should never have been established anyway, a handful of manufacturers in textiles, metal processing and agri-business are flourishing. Factories set up to service a protected home market and a thriving mining industry, at home and next door in Zaire, are now operating in a very different and more competitive environment. The net result is likely to be a slimmed down version of manufacturing as import substitution gives way to a leaner more export-focused sector, and one reliant on linkages with mining and agriculture rather than selling final consumer goods to Zambians. There is obvious potential in tourism although this is hostage to inadequate infrastructure and competition from neighbouring Zimbabwe which is exploiting tourist opportunities far more efficiently. With mining, agriculture and manufacturing output all falling this year, there will be little growth, although services, especially finance, are booming, and there is anecdotal evidence aplenty of vibrant informal sector activity. Weather permitting, a strong upturn is likely in 1995, although structural constraints are such that it is going to be a long haul back to the balmy days of the late 1960s. Reform is beginning to pay dividends. The economic outlook is brighter than at any time since the early 1970s - reserves covering three months imports; falling inflation; a stable exchange rate; an increase in government revenue to 15 per cent of gross domestic product from 12.9 per cent; and the prospect of both an Esaf loan next year and substantial Paris Club debt reduction. The crucial challenges now are to satisfy the World Bank on structural reform, while moving rapidly and decisively to privatise ZCCM. The achievements of the past year will wither and die without the support of root-and-branch structural change.</p>

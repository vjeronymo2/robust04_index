			<p><P> January 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 2 DIE, 1 HURT AS JETS COLLIDE OVER WEST GERMANY  </P> <P> A British Tornado fighter jet collided in the air Friday with two West German  military aircraft and crashed near the town of Wiesmoor in the northwest corner  of West Germany.  </P> <P> The two crewmen in the British plane were killed, officials said, and a West  German pilot was injured. Five houses were slightly damaged by falling debris  but no injuries were reported among the townspeople.  </P> <P> The incident is certain to renew public opposition to low-level military  flights over West Germany, sources in Bonn said Friday. Officials of the North  Atlantic Treaty Organization are concerned that a reduction in training flights  will reduce combat efficiency.  </P> <P> Friday's incident occurred when the British jet, which was on a routine flight,  flew into a formation of West German Alfajet trainers preparing to land at  Wittmund Air Base.  </P> <P> The British plane collided with two of the West German planes, causing one to  crash and the other to make a forced landing at the base.  </P> <P> The British pilot and navigator were killed. The West German pilot whose  damaged aircraft crashed was injured but parachuted safely to the ground.  </P> <P> Witnesses said the British plane crashed about 500 yards from a village school  at Wiesmoor.  </P> <P> A government source said the planes had been flying at an altitude of about 560  feet over lowlands near the North Sea, just east of the Dutch border.  </P></p>

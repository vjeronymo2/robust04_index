			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Yalcin Dogan from the "Daily" column: "The Prosperity </F> Plus Nationalist Action Party Government"]    [Excerpts] The state's guards in the southeast submitted  their candidacy as part of the PP [Prosperity Party] and won in  the municipal elections!... Or, people active in their region,  who had been kidnapped by Apo [Abdullah Ocalan] and taken into  the mountains, were released upon Apo's command, came down from  the mountains, became PP candidates, and became mayors!    After Istanbul, Ankara was also lost!... The PP was  victorious in Ankara as well. According to the current results,  of the 76 provinces, the PP won 27 and the NAP [Nationalist  Action Party] eight. Together they received more than 26  percent of the votes. Given the current election system, the  meaning of these results "within a suitable geographic  distribution" is clear:    "The 27 March elections have brought the PP-NAP alliance to  power!"    When one studies these results, the TPP [True Path Party]  enthusiasm over "being the first party" is meaningless. As for  the SDPP [Social Democratic Populist Party], it has nothing to  say anyway. Therefore, the current TPP-SDPP government "is  overshadowed by the PP-NAP alliance."    To the aforementioned results, one should also add those in  Turkey's three metropolitan areas. The PP won outright in  Istanbul and Ankara. If one also adds the case of Burhan  Ozfatura from Izmir, who is known to be "a staunch PP man" but  who ran in the elections as a TPP candidate, one can say that  three of Turkey's key cities are under the control of the PP.  Furthermore, one should bear in mind that "the NAP supported  the TPP in Izmir" and that Ozfatura won the elections "by  consolidating his religious identity through the support of the  NAP."    Predictions have been fulfilled. The votes cast as a  backlash from the suburbs of the metropolitan areas were cast  for the PP. The future of these cities is not being determined  by their "owners" but by "outsiders" who immigrated to the  suburbs.    I have been talking to those who have served as mayors in  the  southeast for the last five years. A most striking reality  surfaced in phone conversations I had with them yesterday. "Why  was the PP particularly successful in the southeast?" I seek  the answer to this question....    One should first clarify a contradiction. The PP has become  synonymous with "reaction to the current order," while the PP  candidates who won the elections are actually "the guardians of  the order!" For example, the new mayor of Kars is from the NAP  and is a guard.... The mayors of Cizre, Midyat, Dargecit, and  Guclukonak are "PP members who were formerly guards!" Another  example is the new mayor of Batman, who "is a citizen who has  very close ties with Hezbollah"!    There is a contradiction here. When addressing the people,  the PP claims to be opposed to the current order, but when it  comes to electing its candidates, it "depends on the state."    The state is not even aware of this ploy.    Some of the candidates were "Apo's guests in the mountains"  prior to the elections!... Anyway, most of them are of Kurdish  origin.... Once they came down from the mountains, they  cooperated with the PP and, through the "Apo-PP alliance," won  the mayoralties for the PP. The PP candidates have continuously  stated that "they are aware of the Kurdish reality but that they  will solve the Kurdish problem through brotherhood and peace  within the Islamic framework." The Kurdish reality in the  world; "the keys of heaven in the hereafter!" That is what has  been promised.    Furthermore, the people in the southeast are basically  opposed to the following: ANAP [Motherland Party] particularly  and the TPP propose eradicating terror "through military  measures alone." The people are suffering as a result of this  policy.    The PP, however, says that it "will put a stop to the  bloodshed" and is thus sympathetic to the people. It talks  about a solution other than a military one. At this point, in  reaction against the other parties, the "TPP and ANAP votes are  going to the PP". This is not a casual claim. Gaziantep and  Rize are concrete examples. [passage omitted]    On one hand, there is the PP-NAP alliance, with some 26  percent of the votes. On the other, there are millions of  people "who constitute some 74 percent of the vote and who will  have to bow down to the PP-NAP alliance!" Currently, 26 percent  are victorious and 74 percent defeated! Who caused this? The  very honorable leaders of the TPP, ANAP, the SDPP, the DLP  [Democratic Left Party], and the RPP [Republican People's Party]  and their administrations! May the election results be  auspicious to you honorable leaders!</p>

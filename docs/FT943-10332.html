			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / UK Company News: CRH buys four US businesses for Dollars 66m CRH, the Dublin-based inter-national construction and building materials group, announced yesterday it had made four acquisitions in the north-eastern US for Dollars 66.4m (Pounds 42.8m) cash. Mr Tom Hill, president of CRH's US materials group, said the acquisitions would strengthen the market position of the division in New York and Pennsylvania and extend its operations into Connecticut and Massachusetts. The most significant of the acquisitions is Balf, a Connecticut-based producer of aggregates and asphalt. Also acquired are Keating, which operates two quarries and three asphalt plants in Massachusetts; Lebanon Rock, which operates a dolomite quarry in Pennsylvania; and Sullivan Lafarge, comprising two quarries and five asphalt plants in southern New York state. The acquisitions produced 1.4m tons of aggregates and 1.5m tons of asphalt in 1993. The enlarged US materials group will have some 65 operating locations in seven north-eastern states with nearly 100 plants. Surplus assets from the acquisitions are expected to realise Dollars 10m, and the consideration includes assumed debt. No goodwill arises. CRH raised IPounds 147m in a rights issue last September, substantially improving its balance sheet. Net year-end borrowings were brought down to IPounds 66.6m leaving it with gearing of 11 per cent, against 47 per cent a year earlier.</p>

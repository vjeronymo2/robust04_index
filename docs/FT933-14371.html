			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading A LACK of vitality continued to prevail in stock index futures, although the September contract on the FT-SE 100 did manage to muster a steady day's trading, writes Christine Buckley. The contract opened at 2,841 and closed at 2,845. It weakened to 2,835 about half an hour into trading before finding an upward path. The day's high came at 3pm when it nudged 2,852, but the syndrome of dealers selling when the 2,850 level is breached struck again and the last hour saw a 7-point decline. Volume was respectable at 7,069 contracts and activity was stimulated by the better than expected factory output figures, which spread optimism for the longer term recovery outlook. That activity was, however, tempered by the double-edged element to the output figures - the fading hopes for interest rate cuts. One trader also felt the slight futures revival was helped by investors returning to the market and creating a bounce after several weak days. September was 2 points ahead of its fair value premium to cash, which is 7 points. Traded options moved with conviction and their volume put the previous day's dismal performance firmly in the shadows. Total volume was 29,437, against the previous day's 16,553. Index options took the lion's share, with 8,333 lots in the FT-SE 100 and 4,107 in the Euro FT-SE 100.</p>

			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / UK Company News: BTP improves 29% to Pounds 13m - Advance assisted by three month contribution from MTM BTP, the specialist chemical company which bought most of the assets of the ailing MTM group for Pounds 106.7m in June, yesterday reported a 29 per cent increase in interim profits reflecting the acquisition and organic growth. Pre-tax profits increased to Pounds 13m in the six months to September 30 from Pounds 10.1m in the year-ago period. Turnover jumped 32 per cent to Pounds 130.7m (Pounds 99m). Earnings per share improved 12 per cent to 7.04p (6.26p) and the interim dividend is lifted to 3.45p (3.25p). BTP's share price closed 6p higher at 292p. The MTM operations, part of the group for three months in the first half, contributed Pounds 19.8m to turnover and Pounds 2.15m to operating profits which grew to Pounds 13.9m (Pounds 10.3m). Excluding the seven MTM businesses, all of which were profitable in the first half, operating profits rose by 17.4 per cent. Before the acquisition, two of MTM's businesses, one in the UK and one in the US, had been losing about Pounds 2.5m a year. Mr Frank Buckley, chairman, said the profit turnround had been achieved by discontinuing lossmaking products and raising prices. Following the acquisition BTP is now reporting fin-ancial details on four sectors. The largest of these, adhesives and textile coatings, reported sharply lower operating profits of Pounds 2.79m (Pounds 3.8m), reflecting recession in continental Europe, on turnover which expanded to Pounds 42.1m (Pounds 39.5m). The performance chemicals division reported profits of Pounds 3.29m (Pounds 2.36m) on turnover of Pounds 24.3m (Pounds 15.6m). Excluding the MTM operations profits improved by 11 per cent. The biocides and fine chemicals division also showed strong growth with profits up at Pounds 4.43m (Pounds 1.99m) on turnover of Pounds 33.3m (Pounds 17.7m.). The non-chemicals industrial division reported operating profits of Pounds 3.41m (Pounds 1.89m) on increased turnover of Pounds 31m (Pounds 26.2m) helped by particularly strong growth in its safety harness business reflecting tighter safety legislation in the US. Net interest payments totalled Pounds 906,000 in the first half compared with receipts of Pounds 75,000 in the year-ago period. The group ended September with net borrowings of Pounds 33.8m against net borrowings of Pounds 2m at the end of March. Commenting on prospects Mr Buckley said, 'While we retain a cautious outlook in the uncertain economic climate which prevails in a number of our markets, we continue to view the future with confidence.'</p>

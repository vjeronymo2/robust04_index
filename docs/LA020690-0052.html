			<p><P> February 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Good Evening From Moscow: More than 30 U.S. public television stations will  broadcast "Vremya," a state-run Soviet news show along with an English  translation, for a two-week test period beginning Feb. 12. KCET Channel 28  spokesman Greg Krizman said the station will offer the half-hour program  Mondays through Thursdays at midnight and Fridays at 5:30 p.m. Three other  stations in California, including KOCE in Huntington Beach and KQEC in San  Francisco, will broadcast the program. Stations are trying to line up  underwriters for "Vremya," which could cost $1 million a year, according to  Alan Foster, news director of WGBH in Boston. BETH KLEID  </P></p>

			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Letter: History of gas-powered vehicles rewards study Sir, I noted with interest your article 'British Gas is to launch the first serious attempt to put gas-powered vehicles on UK roads' (September 30). That is not strictly correct, because during the war years an attempt was made by Gas Power Conversions Ltd, a subsidiary of the United Kingdom Gas Corporation, to convert commercial fleets, notably dairy and bakery vehicles, to the use of town gas. The on-vehicle gas was stored in bottles at a pressure of 3,000 psi and the storage station gas stored at a pressure of 5,000 psi. Although the vehicles ran smoothly, economically and successfully, compression of the coal-based town gas created undue compressor maintenance troubles. In parallel with this work, the then Ministry of Fuel, Light &amp; Power had a programme to convert all local authority vehicles to the use of methane generated in sewage works digesters. That was based on work by (I believe) Wandsworth Council engineers and the use of equipment developed by my father, the then chief engineer of Gas Power Conversions Ltd. After successful trials, the programme was abruptly stopped. The reason was that Lord Leathers, in charge of war transport in 1945, had peacetime connections with the petroleum industry. During the Conservative government of 1951, he was in charge of the co-ordination of transport, fuel and power. We were then technically in advance of Germany, where early work had been done by Erren. It has taken 50 years seriously to consider the benefits of gas-powered vehicles. In the meantime other countries have not been so laggardly. E S Andrews, Charles Andrews &amp; Sons Consulting Engineers Charter Buildings, Ashton Lane, Sale, Cheshire M33 1WT</p>

			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> CARSON'S HARRIER STAR HAS ENERGY AND DESIRE TO BURN  </P> <P> Carson junior Steven Gonzales was so bushed after his third-place finish in the  City Section cross-country finals Saturday afternoon that he decided to run a  5,000-meter recreational race the next day.  </P> <P> "I normally tell our kids to rest, but Steve is different," Coach Bill Mocnik  said. "He just gets stronger as the year goes on."  </P> <P> Gonzales cruised to a 4:38 mile split in that 5K on Sunday but then eased off  because it was just a workout. On Saturday, Gonzales will run in the state  Division I cross-country championships in Fresno's Woodward Park. Mocnik thinks  Gonzales can run in the top 10.  </P> <P> Gonzales is one of several athletes from the South Bay who will run at the  state meet. The Palos Verdes girls are going for their third consecutive state  title and second Division I crown.  </P> <P> Junior Israel Pose of Torrance will run in his first state meet after finishing  fourth in the boys 4-A Division at Saturday's Southern Section championships  with a time of 15:19 for three miles.  </P> <P> "I hope I can finish in the top 10," said Pose, a Spanish citizen with  aspirations of running for Spain in the 1992 or '96 Olympic Games. "I'll try to  stick with Bryan Dameworth and those guys and see what happens."  </P> <P> Dameworth is a senior from Agoura who won last year's state Division I title in  15:03 on the 5,000-meter course. Pose's all-time best for 5,000 is 15:36. A  5,000-meter race is equal to 3.1 miles.  </P> <P> Agoura's girls will try to unseat Palos Verdes as the champions. "We've been  running in the shadow of Agoura and Woodbridge all year," Palos Verdes Coach  Joe Kelly said. "They've been ranked ahead of us in the state rankings, and now  we'll see what happens."  </P> <P> Agoura won the 2-A Southern Section title with a total team time of 96:17 -- 44  seconds faster than Palos Verdes but in a different race.  </P> <P> Sophomore Maya Muneno and freshman Tami Wilcox led Palos Verdes on Saturday,  but cross country is a team sport, and Palos Verdes will need good performances  from Cindy Scribe, Joanna Dellagatta, Karen Zareski, Yoko Senga and Margaret  Alley, as well as Muneno and Wilcox, to hold off Agoura.  </P> <P> "We will be fresher," Kelly said. "We won't do any conditioning like we've been  doing. I'll also have the girls cut off on turkey -- a little."  </P> <P> Also traveling to Fresno will be star runner Lucy Diaz and the other San Pedro  girls, who had a surprising second place in the City Section finals. Lucrecia  Mendoza of Banning will also compete, qualifying with her seventh-place finish  in 20:09 for the three-mile course.  </P></p>

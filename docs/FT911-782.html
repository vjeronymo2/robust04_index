			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Compromise shaping on bigger Bundesbank THE Bonn Finance Ministry intends to make concrete proposals on restructuring the Bundesbank within the next few weeks which will avoid a proliferation of new regional central banks to take account of German unity. An official said yesterday that Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, leaned towards Mr Karl Otto Pohl's view that there should be a reduction rather than an increase in the number of Land (state) central banks which help run monetary policy. He added that it was too early to say exactly what line the government would take on changing the Bundesbank structure. An amended Bundesbank law to make allowance for the extra Lander formed through unification is due to be proposed by the government before mid-June. A dispute over the new structure between the Bundesbank directorate and the federal states has led to considerable acrimony. Mr Pohl has made clear to colleagues that he would resign if the government went ahead with a plan, put forward by the majority of the federal states, to set up five new Land central banks in the five new east German Lander. This would bring to 16 the total number of Land central banks. The disagreement appears to have been one of the reasons behind recurrent rumours on the foreign exchange markets that Mr Pohl was about to resign. The Bundesbank denied the latest rumour yesterday. Mr Pohl proposes cutting the number of regional banks to eight from the present 11. A counter-plan backed by the central banks of North Rhine-Westphalia, Bavaria and Baden-Wurttemberg proposes raising the number by one to 12. Since the government opposes the '16 plan' but has sympathy for the Lander objections, a compromise seems to be shaping up in favour of the plan for 12 central banks. Mr Pohl would find this unsatisfactory - but would not resign.</p>

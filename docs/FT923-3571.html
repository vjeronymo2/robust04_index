			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Hurd and Clarke back growing demand for press privacy bill MR DOUGLAS HURD has joined Mr John Major, the prime minister, in adding his voice to those in the government ready to back a privacy law to restrict press coverage of the personal lives of the Royal Family and other public figures. The foreign secretary's support increases the prospect that ministers will support the principle of legislation when an independent commission on press freedom, chaired by Sir David Calcutt QC, reports in January. Ministers insist that no decisions will be taken until after the report is delivered. They nevertheless believe that the latest press coverage of the private life of Mr David Mellor, the heritage secretary, who is responsible for overseeing the media, will strengthen a tide of opinion among MPs running in favour of legislation. Whitehall officials said Mr Kenneth Clarke, who as home secretary would have a crucial role in any decision on statutory regulation, is among others favouring a privacy bill. Some cabinet members still believe that it would be impossible to draw up legislation protecting an individual's private life while allowing proper scrutiny of the behaviour of public figures. Mr Major, who will spend the weekend with the Queen at Balmoral, has signalled his anger at the intense scrutiny by the tabloid press of the marriage difficulties of Prince Charles and Prince Andrew. Mr Hurd, who was responsible for the press as home secretary before his move to the Foreign Office, has consistently opposed the idea of a privacy law, but it is understood that he changed his position during the summer after the blanket coverage by the tabloids of the royal marriage. Mellor has PM's support, Page 8</p>

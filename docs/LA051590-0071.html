			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ISRAEL TO REOPEN 6 UNIVERSITIES IN WEST BANK AND GAZA STRIP  </P> <P> Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir on Monday ordered the gradual reopening of six  Palestinian universities in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip that  have been closed for more than two years.  </P> <P> The move is likely to improve Israel's relations with the United States.  </P> <P> They have been strained in recent weeks over Shamir's increasing Jewish  settlement activity in the occupied lands.  </P> <P> The army closed the six universities shortly after a Palestinian uprising broke  out in December, 1987. The government said the universities were hotbeds of  anti-Israeli violence. The United States and Western Europe had sharply  criticized the measure as collective punishment.  </P> <P> Shamir spokesman Avi Pazner said Monday that the prime minister instructed his  adviser for the occupied lands, Shmuel Goren, to meet with the heads of the  universities to discuss conditions of the reopening.  </P> <P> Goren said the first university will open within two days. There are five  universities in the West Bank and one in the Gaza Strip, with a total of 18,000  students.  </P> <P> Although he said authorities were encouraged by the declining bloodshed in  recent months, Goren told reporters that if violence recurs, the facilities  will be closed.  </P> <P> Pazner and Goren denied that the decision is aimed at appeasing the United  States.  </P> <P> "We hope it will bring us a good reaction from the United States and Europe,  but our main consideration was security," Goren said.  </P> <P> The six universities are Bethlehem University, Islamic University, Birzeit  University, Hebron University, An-Najah University and Jerusalem University.  </P></p>

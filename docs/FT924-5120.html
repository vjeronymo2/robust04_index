			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Opec agrees to trim oil output A DEAL between Iran and Saudi Arabia broke the deadlock at talks between ministers from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec), allowing them to agree a cut in oil output yesterday. Ministers are hoping the market will draw some comfort from their announced cutbacks and that prices will rise. North Sea Brent crude oil for delivery in January moved 10 cents higher to Dollars 18.90 a barrel on news of yesterday's agreement. Opec agreed to restrict its oil production to 24.58m barrels a day (b/d) after both Saudi Arabia and Iran said they would trim their output. Although Kuwait had insisted on a quota of 1.75m b/d, the emirate agreed to produce 1.5m b/d and to boost its output when market conditions and prices allowed. The new production ceiling will be in place for the first quarter of next year when the organisation expects demand for its oil to be around 25m b/d. But member nations have said they will try to implement cuts in December in order to give additional support to prices. As part of the agreement, Iran will cut its output to 3.49m b/d from 3.8m b/d which Mr Gholamreza Aqazadeh, the Iranian oil minister, claimed it was producing in October. At the same time Saudi Arabia will shave its output slightly to 8.39m b/d from 8.4m b/d. Ministers from both countries had earlier refused to cut output. A compromise was reached after all-night talks on Thursday with Mr Alirio Parra, Venezuela's minister of energy and mines and Opec president. The agreement does little more than reinforce the status quo since production by Opec countries is currently at 25m b/d. Without Ecuador, which officially left the organisation at this meeting, production is 24.7m b/d, implying a cut of little over 100,000 b/d. But oil traders say the fact that countries will try to implement cuts straight away gives a signal to the market that production discipline will be reintroduced. In addition, this agreement marks the first time for over a year that Iran or Saudi Arabia has not expressed grave reservations about the outcome. 'I think the agreement will get an improvement in price of one to two dollars a barrel, maybe by the end of the year,' said Mr Hacene Mefti, Algeria's energy minister.</p>

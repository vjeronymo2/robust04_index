			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: by Nikolay </F> Zherebtsov and Andrey Petrovsky]    [Text] The head of the Russian presidential administration  Sergey Filatov has told Interfax that his meeting late on Monday  with the Chechen State Secretary Aslanbek Akbulatov helped to  finalize the stand of Groznyy that is suggesting its own version  of the friendship and cooperation treaty with Russia.    Filatov thinks Moscow should not hurry with the meeting of  the presidents of the two sides before the package of documents  Boris Yeltsin and Dzhokhar Dudayev are to discuss is fully  ready. IF Note: Earlier a high-ranking source in the  administration of the Russian president claimed that serious  talks with Chechnya would be held, if the leadership of the  republic in the Northern Caucasus fulfilled two conditions put  forward by Moscow: stopped accusing Russia of imperial  ambitions and used the treaty signed with Tataria [Tatar  Republic] on the separation of powers as the basis for the  Moscow meeting.    Filatov said he informed Akbulatov about the results of the  consultations between the speaker of the State Duma Ivan Rybkin  and the Minister for Nationalities and Regional Policy Sergey  Shakhray based on the assumption that relations with Chechnya  will become a subject of parliamentary hearings.    Earlier the chairman of the Council of the Federation  Vladimir Shumeyko stressed that the upper house would discuss  the issue no matter whether the lower house deals with it or not.    "The council should represent all members of the Federation.  It is impossible to say that Chechnya is not a member of the  Russian Federation because there have been no laws on its  separation", Shumeyko said.    The only expression of the attitude of the federal  authorities to Chechnya, according to him, is a resolution  passed by the Supreme Soviet or the Congress of People's  Deputies invalidating the results of presidential elections in  Chechnya. The council can discuss the resolution and raise the  question of abolishing it and recognizing the election results,  Shumeyko said.    Meanwhile, the chairman of the Chechen parliament Akhyad  Idigov has said in an interview with Interfax in Groznyy that  the summit is necessary for stabilizing bilateral relations.    Commenting on the Moscow visit by the Chechen state  secretary  Idigov said that the talks between Russia and Chechnya are a  continuation of the constructive work in which both sides are  interested. "Chechnya has not stopped active efforts to  continue the process of negotiations with the Russian leadership  because we are interested in normalizing both political and  economic ties with Russia", Idigov said.    On the political situation in Chechnya Idigov said it is  relatively stable even considering the relations between  different political forces. He claimed that the economic  situation has improved considerably. "All the rest will depend  on what our relations with Russia are going to be like", Idigov  concluded.</p>

			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Bosnia peace plan in serious trouble: The Vance-Owen proposal is the only show in town, but it may soon close THE Bosnian peace plan drawn up by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen is now in serious trouble, in spite of the absence of a viable alternative to end the conflict, according to a growing number of diplomatic observers. The original strategy of the mediators, to isolate the Bosnian Serbs so that the full weight of international pressure could be focused on them to sign the peace agreement, has not, so far, had the desired results. The fact that the Bosnian Moslems recently joined the Croats in endorsing the Vance-Owen plan has done little or nothing to persuade the Serbs to follow suit. Though their leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, claims the Serbs are able to accept 80 per cent of its provisions, the plan has effectively been rejected by the self-styled Bosnian Serb parliament. What the Bosnian Serbs want is modifications to the Vance-Owen map of the 10 semi-autonomous provinces into which Bosnia would be divided, which would not only give them more territory than the 43 per cent assigned to them, but ensure that some of it adjoins Serbia proper. That is not only unacceptable to the Moslems, but the two mediators, who have done their best to ensure that Bosnia-Hercegovina will remain an independent state and that the Bosnian Serbs will not be given the opportunity to join up with the 'motherland.' The most discouraging aspect is that President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, looked upon by Mr Vance and Lord Owen and most of the international community as the man who holds the key to the Bosnian conflict, has given only rare signs of putting his full weight behind the efforts to make Mr Karadzic sign. The last time he really twisted Mr Karadzic's arm was at the end of January this year, when he forced him to sign the constitutional framework for Bosnia-Hercegovina, one of the four sections into which the peace plan is divided. President Milosevic's most recent contribution to the peace process was when he pushed the Bosnian Serbs into agreeing to a ceasefire with the other warring parties, which is now 10 days old and has held in most areas except around Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia. Mr Milosevic, however, does not seem to be ready to go the last mile. On the contrary, he is doing his best to sow dissension in the ranks of the western members of the United Nations Security Council by embarrassingly heaping praise on the US for its misgivings about the Vance-Owen plan and its alleged desire not to play 'the world policeman.' That there are disagreements between the western allies, not to mention Russia, on how to handle the Bosnian crisis, has long been an open secret. The Clinton administration from the very beginning made it plain that it did not think the Vance-Owen plan was either fair to the Moslems or that it offered a solution which could be implemented in practice. At the same time, the US has all along made it clear it does not intend to act on its own in Bosnia and wants to co-ordinate its policies with its UN Security Council partners. It thus reluctantly gave its support to the Vance-Owen peace process, strongly supported by both the 10-nation European Community and Russia, and is struggling to find an acceptable compromise on what further sanctions to take against Serbia. In deference to President Boris Yeltsin's domestic political difficulties, Mr Clinton is reported to have agreed to postpone a Security Council vote on tighter sanctions against Serbia, a traditional Russian ally and protege, until after the planned Russian referendum on April 25. Washington has also been obliged to rein in its enthusiasm for the selective lifting of the UN embargo on arms deliveries to the rump Yugoslavia, to help the Moslems. This is a measure that is strongly opposed not only by Russia, but by Britain and France, which fear that it would both intensify the war in Bosnia and increase the vulnerability of their troops on the ground under UN command. In the words of Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, lifting the embargo on arms deliveries to the Moslems is more likely to create 'a level killing field' than contributing to the level playing field in Bosnia talked about by the Americans. The US like Britain, France and Russia, is not yet prepared to contemplate 'direct military intervention' in the Bosnian conflict, which would be tantamount to sending vast numbers of troops to wage war against the Bosnian Serbs for an indefinite period. If, however, the Vance-Owen process does not very soon demonstrate that a diplomatic solution is still on the cards, the calls for tougher military action are bound to increase, as they already have done following the humanitarian disaster in Srebrenica.</p>

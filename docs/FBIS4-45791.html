			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Used Plastics Identified in Seconds"; </F> Subhead: "Infrared Identification System Improves Recycling  Quality in Automobile Recycling"]    [Text]Wiesbaden, 8 April  1994 -- Whereas it is already possible to sort packaging  plastics using detectors that operate in the infrared mid-range,  so far rapid identification of the large number of engineering  plastics has not been feasible. Black inked or highly filled  types in particular have created problems. It has now been  possible to resolve this problem under a joint project of the  Development Group for the Recycling of Plastics [EWvK] in  Wiesbaden together with Bavarian Motor Works [BMW] in Munich,  plus the European Automobile Manufacturers' Joint Research  Committee and Bruker Analytical Measurement Methods in Karlsruhe.    At the "Recycle '94" trade fair in Davos, 14-18 March, and  at  the 23-24 March annual meeting of the Association of German  Engineers [VDI]-K [expansion not given] in Mannheim, the project  partners demonstrated the new detection system for rapid  identification of plastics. According to EWvK, it is possible  with a rapidity measured in seconds to distinguish 23 different  types of plastics and blends in all known modifications using  the equipment developed by Bruker. To do so, it is necessary for  only one second to hold the pieces needing identification to a  measurement window and activate a foot switch. In three seconds  the result shows up on the monitor. Prior processing of the  pieces is only required if they are painted or underwent surface  treatment. Removal of the paint using a finger milling-cutter or  a conical pin-type milling-cutter, ranging over only a 10  millimeter [mm] diameter, is sufficient prior preparation for  the sampling.    Bruker's original piece of equipment has been undergoing  testing for months at the BMW disassembly center in Landshut.  According to EWvK, the experiments have gone so well that the  sorting of the plastic pieces using disassembly manuals that has  been performed until now in Landshut, has undergone replacement.  The plastics are now separated by means of the identification  system. Already during the test phase, there has been a definite  decline in the contamination of pure sorts of materials through  mis-sorting.</p>

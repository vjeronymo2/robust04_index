			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Company news (This week): Progress comes into sight after the clear-out - Sears The improvement in the performance of Sears, the UK's largest multiple high street retailer, over the past two years has been obscured by a mass of restructuring charges. But tomorrow it is expected to give a clear message with an increase in full-year pre-tax profits to about Pounds 127m. That represents a substantial uplift from last year's Pounds 83.5m after a net Pounds 16.9m of exceptional costs. The increase is even more dramatic on an FRS 3 basis, according to which Sears made a prior-year loss of Pounds 47.8m, after Pounds 106.8m of charges. The advance reflects the success of Mr Liam Strong, chief executive since February 1992, in refocusing the sprawling retail group. He has shaken up senior management, established a clear strategy and sold non-core businesses. The first stage was the reorganisation of British Shoe Corporation, the UK's largest footwear retailer, then operating under five fascias including Dolcis, Saxone and Freeman Hardy Willis. Mr Strong closed 350 shops, cutting 1,800 jobs, as well as introducing the mass market format Shoe Express, the more middle market Hush Puppy, and out-of-town Shoe City. The challenge for Sears now is to improve the performance of its other retail businesses: in womenswear and childrenswear - which include names such as Wallis, Miss Selfridge and Richards; sport and leisure (Olympus, Milletts); and mail order (Freemans). The uplift in profits suggests Mr Strong is having some success. However, the performance of the Adams childrenswear chain remains a concern, with rival Mothercare, staging a recovery. The future of the mail order business, number four in the UK, is also open to debate. As for Selfridges, the prestigious Oxford Street department store, Sears has demonstrated its commitment by announcing a Pounds 50m update.</p>

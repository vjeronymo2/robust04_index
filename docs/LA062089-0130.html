			<p><P> June 20, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SWINDALL CONVICTED OF LYING IN PROBE OF MONEY LAUNDERING  </P> <P> Former Rep. Pat Swindall was convicted today of nine counts of perjury for  lying to a federal grand jury about a money-laundering scheme.  </P> <P> The 38-year-old conservative Republican, who served two terms in Congress from  Atlanta's suburbs before being defeated in November, could receive up to five  years in prison plus fines of $250,000 on each count at sentencing Aug. 25.  </P> <P> Swindall left the courtroom saying he was "numb, disappointed, but not terribly  surprised," as his wife, Kim, stood behind him, wearing a lilac maternity dress  and clutching his hand.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Have Been Forgiven'  </P> <P> "I had said months before that I had gotten into something," Swindall said,  referring to a tearful apology he issued after the case became public last  year. "I confessed publicly and openly, and for that I feel I have been  forgiven by God and my constituents.  </P> <P> "I'm prepared to do whatever I have to do. If I have to go to prison, I'll go  to prison and I'll have a good attitude about it."  </P> <P> The jury deliberated 17 hours over four days after nearly four weeks of  testimony. Swindall was indicted in October on 10 counts of perjury. U.S.  District Judge Richard C. Freeman dismissed one count during the trial.  </P> <P> The former congressman was accused of lying to a grand jury in 1988 about his  1987 negotiations with an IRS agent posing as a drug-money launderer and with  Swindall associate Charles LeChasney, later convicted of money laundering.  </P> <P> Among other things, Swindall was found guilty of perjury for denying that he  had been told that the $850,000 he was seeking from the agent to finish  building his luxurious home contained proceeds from drug trafficking.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Appeal Planned  </P> <P> Swindall's chief attorney, Richard Hendrix, said he will appeal.  </P> <P> Swindall, a lanky, boyish lawyer, went to Congress in 1984 from the city's  affluent eastern suburbs as a conservative, fundamentalist Christian. Under the  cloud of the perjury indictment, he lost to Democrat Ben Jones, who appeared in  "The Dukes of Hazzard" television series.  </P> <P> The jury heard secretly taped conversations with the undercover agent, Mike  Mullaney, in which Swindall was told that the $850,000 "certainly" included  drug money and that he would be part of an operation to "wash" cash. Swindall  proposed that a mortgage company be set up by LeChasney as a "buffer" to allow  him to "borrow" the agent's money.  </P> <P> In their last conversation after Swindall had received a $150,000 advance, he  told Mullaney, "If Charles wants to launder y'all's money, fine. But I can't do  that. . . . I can borrow the money from Charles."  </P> <P> Swindall was a largely unknown lawyer and furniture store owner when he was  elected in an upset in 1984, toppling veteran Democrat Elliott Levitas.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Biblical Score Card'  </P> <P> Swindall, a Presbyterian, took his campaign to evangelical churches,  distributing a "Biblical score card" in his race against Levitas, who is  Jewish.  </P> <P> In his two terms, Swindall staunchly voted with the Reagan right and acquired a  reputation as somewhat of a gadfly, voting against such popular programs as  school lunch funding and aid to African famine victims. He filed a brief with  the Supreme Court advocating the teaching of "creationism" in schools.  </P></p>

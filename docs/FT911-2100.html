			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / International Company News: Rivals celebrate a partial victory - A business-like conclusion to the Mondadori saga THE 16-month feud for Mondadori, which came to an end very early yesterday morning, has been a long slog for partial victory at best for Mr Carlo De Benedetti. Not that his rival, Mr Silvio Berlusconi, has emerged in much better shape from a corporate battle that even outdid last year's Enimont saga for duration, vitriol and hints of political manipulation. But although neither side has gained the prize for which it invested so heavily, both factions can at least portray this week's agreement to divide Mondadori as a success. At the least, the deal finally removes the uncertainty which has dogged both camps during a battle in which fortunes changed overnight as a result of surprise court decisions. Both sides claimed on different occasions that the cards were stacked against them. While Mr De Benedetti's Cir hinted at political forces in Rome working against it, Mr Berlusconi consistently lamented the passage of a law last year which would ultimately oblige him to give up any newspaper interests. And throughout, Mondadori itself suffered as talented staff left, urgent decisions were left unresolved and indebtedness increased. Though sales should reach about L2,000bn (Dollars 1.5bn) in 1990, the company will barely break even. Although Mr De Benedetti and Mr Berlusconi failed to gain full control of Mondadori, both stressed the advantages of being the unchallenged master of at least part. 'We are all very satisfied with the accord we have reached,' said Mr De Benedetti. 'There is a big sense of satisfaction that it is over,' added Mr Berlusconi later. Both now claim to have buried the hatchet - at least as far as the cameras are concerned - and had lunch together yesterday to seal their new relationship. Businesslike relations will be essential in view of the fact that the two will jointly own Manzoni, Mondadori's advertising arm. Apart from the strong commercial links between the assets now being divided, the two also 'looked at a whole series of other possibilities of mutual interest', according to Mr Berlusconi. Financially, the outcome is mixed at best, at least in the short term. Cir will realise about L997bn for its Mondadori and Amef shares, leaving a net profit of about L67bn on its original investment in the group. That is hardly a re-run of the pasting it took on Societe Generale de Belgique, as some analysts expected, but not a king's ransom either. Mr Berlusconi has been even more coy about the financial consequences of the deal, declining even to name how much his stakes in Mondadori and Amef had cost. One reason for both sides' reluctance to be precise about figures is that the Mondadori affair is still not over, in the sense that further income is still possible. The stock market features largely for both. For Mr De Benedetti, full control of both L'Espresso, which is quoted, and La Repubblica, which is not, opens the door to substantial cash-raising exercises for both in due course. Mr De Benedetti's Cir holding company now owns 88.5 per cent of L'Espresso, and all of La Repubblica. An early step will be to increase the proportion of L'Espresso shares quoted publicly from the current 5 per cent to an appreciably higher figure, he says. Likewise, market conditions permitting, it should not be long until La Repubblica makes its stock market debut. It is believed that Cir's purchase of Cartiera di Ascoli, the Mondadori-owned holding company and one of Italy's biggest paper makers before selling its productive interests, has been to gain an already-quoted vehicle to accelerate a future La Repubblica quotation. Mr Berlusconi also has his eyes on the bourse as a way of reducing his financial commitment to the Mondadori affair. Once Mondadori has been merged with Amef, its holding company, it will probably not be long before he seeks to issue up to 49 per cent of its stock. Thus, the real outcome of this week's deal will depend largely on the prices to be realised on the stock market.</p>

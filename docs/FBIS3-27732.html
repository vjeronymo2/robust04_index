The request  followed the Diet's passage of four political reform bills  earlier in the day as a result of a compromise accord reached  between Hosokawa and Yohei Kono, president of the main  opposition Liberal Democratic Party in a last-ditch meeting late  Friday.    The attention of the business community now focuses on how  speedily the Hosokawa administration will carry out economic  stimulative measures. Business leaders by and large believe the  foundation has been laid for stimulating the post-bubble,  stagnant economy.    Hiroshi Saito, chairman of the Japan Iron and Steel  Federation, noted the economy is now in critical shape.    "I strongly hope the government will draft a budget (for  fiscal 1994) and implement pump-priming measures at the earliest  possible time, including a substantial cut in income taxes,"  said Saito, also chairman of Nippon Steel Corp., the world's  largest steel producer. The view was shared by Kohei Abe, head  of the Federation of Electric Power Companies, who said he also  wants the government to grapple with trade issues with the  United States in a positive way ahead of a February 11 summit  between Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington.    Reiichi Yumikura, chairman of the Japan Chemical Fibers  Association, said Hosokawa should take the leadership in  reducing income taxes "retroactively and speedily."    Meanwhile, an executive of a major automaker expressed the  view that Diet approval of the political reform program has made  it possible for the coalition government of Prime Minister  Hosokawa to bolster its power base.    "This in turn indicates Hosokawa may be able to exchange  views frankly with Clinton on bilateral problems such as trade  imbalances and the yen's ascent against the U.S. dollar," he  said.    Japanese automakers, electronics companies and other  export-oriented manufacturers have been badly hurt by the rapid  appreciation of the yen in value which makes their products  abroad more expensive.</p>

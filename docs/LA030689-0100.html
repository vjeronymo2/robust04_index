			<p><P> March 6, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SNOWFALL BLANKETS MISSOURI, STORM CRIPPLES TRAVEL  </P> <P> A late winter storm dumped 14 inches of snow on Missouri today and plowed into  the Eastern Seaboard, icing over highways from Texas to New York City and  crippling ground travel for beleaguered businessmen and tourists already  frustrated by an airline strike.  </P> <P> The National Weather Service said the storm -- coming just two weeks before the  start of spring -- as among the worst to hit Missouri in this century.  </P> <P> Heavy rains caused new flooding in Tennessee and West Virginia, gale-force  winds jammed huge chunks of ice onto shoreline property along Lake Erie and  bitter cold poured into the Gulf states, dropping temperatures to record low  levels in at least 13 cities.  </P> <P> The storm reached from Texas to New York City, depositing a combination of  rain, freezing rain, sleet and snow along its path. Snow cluttered New York  City streets during the morning rush hour.  </P></p>

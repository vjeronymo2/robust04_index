			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Observer: Apart-hate whine Disquieting news for those who made the supreme sacrifice by boycotting South African wine during the long hard years of apartheid. Their pain was in vain, it seems. For if they turned to Bulgarian wine as an acceptable, reasonably priced substitute, they were in fact quite likely to have been drinking Stellenbosch's finest. South African wine producers proved themselves a cunning adversary; they successfully marketed their product in Europe and elsewhere through obliging Bulgarian middlemen. Cheers: or Totsiens, as they say in Afrikaans.</p>

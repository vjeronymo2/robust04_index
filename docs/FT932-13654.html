			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / UK Company News: Chinese trust to be launched THE FIRST UK-listed investment trust to concentrate on China is set to be launched over the next few weeks. The China Investment Trust will join the market via a placing by James Capel and will be managed by Jupiter Tyndall (Asia). Yesterday, CST Emerging Asia Trust announced that it was in talks which could lead to a takeover by the China Investment Trust once the latter comes to the market. CST is also managed by Jupiter Tyndall, which beat off a move to replace it as manager last year by promising to produce alternative proposals to shareholders. The offer will provide a full cash alternative which is expected to be at about 95 per cent of CST's fully diluted net asset value. The China Investment Trust will aim for long-term capital growth by investing in shares on the Shenzen and Shanghai exchanges as well as by investing in 'China plays' on other exchanges such as Hong Kong and Taiwan.</p>

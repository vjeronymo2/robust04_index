			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From 7 Mar ARIPAEV, p 1, 3; "News Bulletin" No. 44/94] </F>   [Text] Monday, March 7 -- Estonia will have to build an  ammunition factory within a year in order to guarantee a  sufficient supply of ammunition for its armed forces, Riigikogu  [parliament] Defence Commission Chairman Rein Helme announced.  The factory should also produce antipersonnel and antitank  mines, he added.    Helme explained that the factory could cooperate with the  oil  shale mining firm "Eesti Pdlevkivi", which intends to build an  explosives factory for its own needs. The intended factory  might also service and repair arms or produce weapons for  Estonia's defence forces, he added. Cooperation offers have  been received from Israel and South Africa. The production of  ammunition would reinforce Estonia's international position,  Helme stressed, but pointed out that the Baltic market would be  insufficient for a larger factory.</p>

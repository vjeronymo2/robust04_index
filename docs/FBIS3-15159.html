Lithuanian authorities planned to arrest Yegorov in his  Klaipeda apartment but the suspect was reportedly warned about  the operation and managed to slip away.    The prosecutor's office said the failed operation was  carried  out by the Lithuanian National Security Service.    Kestutis Betingis, head of the State Crimes Department, told  the RESPUBLIKA newspaper that he will officially demand to  dismiss some employees of the service.    Betingis supposes that Yegorov may have been either arrested  on Friday [25 February] and then released, or was informed about  the operation in advance.    The official said this was "an open betrayal" or simply  unsuccessful work, but "somebody did this on purpose."    Prosecutor General Arturas Paulauskas confirmed to  RESPUBLIKA  that the head of the security service, Jurgis Jurgelis,  telephoned him several times before the operation and tried to  convince the prosecutor not to arrest Yegorov. Jurgelis  reportedly said "how will we look politically" if a former  Soviet serviceman is arrested.    Jurgelis is on sick-leave since Monday, his secretary said.    In 1991, Colonel Yegorov headed the military-political  section of the Soviet coast guard division stationed in  Klaipeda. The prosecutor's office found evidence that he  initiated unlawful actions of the Soviet military during the  1991 coup.</p>

			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Investment in Japan set to fall sharply INVESTMENT in Japan will be cut severely over the next year and a half according to a wide-ranging survey published by the Industrial Bank of Japan which warns that this year's slide in corporate investment will gather momentum in 1993. The IBJ forecasts that corporate investment for this fiscal year, which ends next March, will fall by 2.5 per cent from last year. But the decline will accelerate in 1993 with a 5.4 per cent drop. The severity of the downturn is highlighted by unprecedented cuts in investment by non-manufacturing companies, excluding the electricity utilities. Non-manufacturers expect to reduce investment by 1 per cent this year and by 5.3 per cent next year. The cuts will be deeper in manufacturing, with an 11.8 per cent reduction this year followed by a 12.9 per cent fall in 1993, with some industries such as chemicals, paper and pulp and electric machinery making cuts of more than 20 per cent this year. Investment in the car industry is forecast to fall by 10.5 per cent this year and 7 per cent next year. The bank said the results of the August survey of investment intentions among 3,536 of its corporate customers were the most pessimistic results for August since the survey began in 1969. Mr Noboru Hatakeyama, the vice minister for international affairs at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, underlined the intractability of the downturn by warning that it could take manufacturers some time to reduce their unsold inventories to acceptable levels. The IBJ warned that high investment in the late 1980s, when manufacturing investment increased by more than 20 per cent a year for three years, has left several sectors with chronic overcapacity. As a result it would be difficult for any industry, including cars and electronics, construction and retailing, to act as the engine of an investment led recovery, the bank warned. Further falls in profits would worsen the investment outlook for 1993, the bank warned. The decline in investment, combined with the sluggish stock market and lower bank lending, is encouraging a significant shift in how companies finance their investment. The share of investment funded from companies' own resources is forecast to rise from 54.7 per cent last year to 65 per cent next year, while borrowing will fall by 1 percentage point to 17.4 per cent and issues of new equity will fall to 0.4 per cent. The decline in the Japanese economy is taking a heavy toll on imports of foreign cars, which fell by about 9 per cent in August compared with last year, according to figures published yesterday by the Japan Automobile Importers' Association. Sales of US cars rose marginally to 2,866, thanks mainly to a surge in imports of Honda cars from its US plants, while European imports fell from 7,839 in last August to 6,988 this year. Sales of Audis and Volkswagens are still rising, while sales of BMW and Mercedes Benz cars are falling.</p>

			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / Tapie makes political comeback MR Bernard Tapie, the flamboyant French politician and businessman, has staged an astonishing end-of-year comeback by regaining the cabinet post he lost earlier this year because of his involvement in a fraud case. Mr Tapie has been re-appointed minister of towns, a post he held for seven weeks before being forced to resign in May pending the fraud trial. The case brought against him by Mr Georges Tranchant, the opposition politician who was once a business partner, was dismissed last week, paving the way for his return. A public prosecutor has asked for corruption charges against Mr Francois Leotard, a former culture minister, to be dropped, his lawyer said yesterday, Reuter reports from Paris. Mr Leotard was indicted on charges of buying a Riviera mansion at a knock-down price in return for municipal contracts.</p>

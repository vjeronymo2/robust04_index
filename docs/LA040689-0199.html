Final  </P> <P> SIKH RADICALS KILL 9 IN PUNJAB  </P> <P> Sikh extremists killed nine people in northern Punjab today, including a Sikh  priest dragged from his temple and hanged from a tree.  </P> <P> Twelve members of the Bhindranwale Tiger Force of Khalistan stormed the home of  Buta Singh in Jaspal and accused him of being a police informer, police said.  </P> <P> Buta Singh was among 104 Sikhs freed from jail March 6 under a new government  policy of placating moderate Sikhs. They had been held four years without trial  after their capture in a bloody 1984 army assault to oust armed Sikh radicals  in Amritsar's Golden Temple.  </P> <P> "He begged for mercy and even told them that he was one of the Jodhpur  detainees who fought the battle for Khalistan," said Buta Singh's widow,  Balwinder Kaur.  </P></p>

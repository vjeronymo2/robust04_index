			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Nigerian central bank probe ordered Nigeria's military ruler General Sani Abacha yesterday established a panel to investigate the central bank and told it to find out whether the institution was to blame for the country's economic woes. 'It has. . . become necessary to find out whether the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has been a culprit or a victim in the unfortunate sequences that have culminated in our present economic troubles,' Gen Abacha said. The establishment of the seven-member panel of inquiry led by an economist, Mr Pius Okigbo, comes after the government last week unveiled the 1994 budget which placed greater responsibility on the CBN for the management of Nigeria's scarce foreign exchange. Many financial analysts doubt whether the central bank has the capacity to implement and police the policies effectively.</p>

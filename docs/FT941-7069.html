			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Sheafbank raises Pounds 8.1m via placing Sheafbank Property Trust is to raise Pounds 8.1m through a placement to fund the purchase from Philips Pension Fund of the outstanding 50 per cent of UK Estates, a property company with a portfolio valued at Pounds 21.9m. Following the acquisition, Sheafbank is to change its name to UK Estates, and has appointed Mr David Ormerod, former managing director of Legal and General Properties, as managing director. The group is placing 35m shares at 25 3/4 p, a 5 per cent discount to Thursday's closing price. The shares will be offered to shareholders on a 1-for-3 basis with one new share for every one convertible preference share. Of the proceeds, Pounds 4.3m will be used for the UK Estates stake. This is a substantial discount to the present valuation, reflecting the strength of the property market since the deal was negotiated in mid-1993. The balance will help reduce gearing to about 95 per cent. Following the transaction, the value of Sheafbank's property portfolio will increase by Pounds 22m to Pounds 33m. Mr David Gradel, chairman, said the enhanced rental income and strengthened balance sheet would provide a base for expansion. The announcement was accompanied by results for the six months to December 31, which showed a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 280,000 (Pounds 200,000). Losses per share were 1.78p (1.29p). Sheafbank has a Pounds 2m deficit on its profit and loss account, but plans to cancel this through transfers from the share premium account.</p>

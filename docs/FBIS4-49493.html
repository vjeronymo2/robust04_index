			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chito Lozada] </F>   [Text] The European Union (EU) will not review quotas  imposed on 15 March this year on selected consumer goods made in  China until December, when the present quota scheme lapses.    Etienne Reuter, head of the Hong Kong office of the European  Union (EU), told the Financial Review that the December review  would only look into a modification of the scheme, which would  probably be reimposed next year.    This was certain unless a strong lobby "provoked" a review  for its removal, Mr Reuter said. The quota scheme was nothing  new... it merely simplified similar schemes imposed by countries  in the EU, he said.    EU members had imposed 4,700 notional restrictions on  imported goods which were simplified into the quota scheme.    Items covered under the quota scheme are toys, footwear,  gloves, porcelain kitchen and tableware, ceramic kitchen and  tableware, glassware and radios.    The imposition of the scheme brought howls of protests from  Hong Kong manufacturers. Many have based their operations in  China.    Meanwhile, Luis Larroque, executive vice-president of the  Spanish Foreign Trade Institute, said Spain had opposed the  quota scheme and was supporting limited barriers against Chinese  goods.    However, the quota scheme was "provisional only" and would  be  lifted when "some part of the EU industries have adjusted to the  world market", Mr Larroque said.    Mr Reuter also gave an assurance that the 20 China-made  products placed under surveillance for possible import quotas  would not mean the EU would necessarily restrict these products  soon.    "They are just being monitored and there are no indications  that trade (of these goods) will be restricted," he said.    Trade groups in Hong Kong and the EU are protesting against  the imposition of the quota scheme and have petitioned the  Chinese government to push for its removal.    The quotas would mean substantial cuts in their export  receipts, which could reach more than $3 billion by year's end,  local groups said.    Europe's Foreign Trade Association (FTA) -- which groups big  importers of Chinese consumer goods, including department stores  -- have written to the Chinese government.    These groups want the import restrictions to be delayed at  least until next year because orders have already been placed  with firms in China.    Local and EU trade groups have also complained that the  quota  scheme was complicated and will result in uncertainties in the  planning of purchases.    Other groups complained that the scheme would increase  bureaucracy and thus add to operating costs.</p>

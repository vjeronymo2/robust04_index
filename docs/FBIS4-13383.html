			<p>BFN     [Text] Colombo, April 17, IRNA -- Iran's parliament  (Majles) Speaker Hojjat-ol-Eslam 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri left Sri  Lanka for Malaysia Sunday morning at the end of his three-day  visit here.    While in Sri Lanka, the speaker held talks with the Sri  Lankan president, his counterpart and a number of Muslim  personalities in that country.    Nateq-Nuri will visit Malaysia at the end of his  three-nation  tour which has already brought him to Pakistan and Sri Lanka.    Before his departure from Colombo, the speaker met with a  number of Sri Lankan Shiite and Sunni Muslim scholars and  writers in which he criticized the indifferent attitude that  international bodies have adopted towards problems facing  Muslims in the world.    Nateq-Nuri referred to the deplorable situation in Gorazde  where a large number of people have been subject to Serbs  attacks in recent days and blamed the biased stance of the  international communities towards the issue.    He said that international bodies and the NATO were not only  watching the genocide of people in Bosnia-Herzegovina but were  trying to divert the world's public opinion from the Serbs  crimes by the means of a few statements.    The speaker said that the U.S. and its allies were trying to  annihilate Muslims throughout the world irrespective of being  Shiite or Sunni, either living in Iran or in any other part of  the world.    Calling on the Sri Lankan Muslims to maitain unity,  Nateq-Nuri promised that an Iranian delegation would visit Sri  Lanka in a near future to study situation of Muslims who have  become homeless as a result of Tamil Tigers attacks.    About 170,000 Sri Lankan Muslims, residing in northern and  eastern parts of the country, have been rendered homeless by  Tamil Tigers who oppose the government.</p>

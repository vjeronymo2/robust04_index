			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE CRUELTY QUESTION  </P> <P> May I nit-pick a bit? Reference is made several times to a Marshall eagle. The  eagle shown with Hubert Wells is a martial eagle. I have seen several of them  in Africa, and I guess that martial in this sense means warlike, for they are  highly effective killers of smaller birds.  </P> <P> JOHN WELLS IREYS  </P> <P> Beverly Hills  </P></p>

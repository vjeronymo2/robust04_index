Pylypchuk, Ukraine people's deputy]    [Text]    1. To stop inflation:    1.1 to close the budget deficit by means of:    a) increasing revenues by means of:    --abolishing all tax relief to all enterprises except ones  employing the handicapped;    --reducing tax rates to stimulate economic activity;    --shifting to taxing prices (sales turnover), thus  eliminating the cause of revenue shortfalls due to corruption;    --and, implementing mass privatization, which will raise  budget revenues.    b) Reducing budgetary outlays by means of:    --ending financing of capital investment by enterprises;    --liquidating industry management entities and their  managerial structures at enterprises (reducing expenditures on  management);    --and, limiting migration to Ukraine by retirees from other  countries.    1.2. To close the foreign trade deficit.    a) To increase exports by means of:    --abolishing export licensing;    --reducing export tariffs;    --and, putting an end to mass uncontrolled smuggling of  goods  out of Ukraine, stimulating the development of export potential.    b) To reduce imports by means of:    --restructuring the existing Ukrainian industrial complex to  produce import substitutions and reduce the dependence of the  Ukrainian economy on traditional suppliers; --attracting foreign  investors with tenders for the production of import  substitutions; --diversifying and converting enterprises of the  military-industrial complex; --increasing protectionism in  nonessential imports; --implementing competitive sale of  convertible currency for essential imports; --shifting from  centralized distribution and sale to sale and distribution using  free market structures; --dissolving the discriminatory  agreement with Russia whereby Ukraine bears the responsibility  for the debt incurred by Ukrainian businessmen to Russian ones,  while Russia bears no such responsibility; --introducing a  system of import preferences for raw materials and advanced  technology; --intensifying the exploitation of old, and  exploration for new, deposits of oil and gas (as well as other  resources); --    --and, developing alternative types and sources of energy.    1.3. To eliminate the imbalance in the supply of goods and  money on the Ukrainian market.    a) To increase the supply of goods and property, by means  of:    --turning factories, plants, stores, land and housing into  salable property; --increasing the stimulus for raising the  production of goods and services by privatization; --conducting  industry-based tenders for foreign investors (in the course of  privatization) to produce goods which are in short supply in  Ukraine; --and, effecting liberalization.    b) To reduce an inflation-producing monetary overhang, by  means of:    --banning the National Bank of Ukraine from issuing  unsupported (product-less) currency; --banning the National Bank  of Ukraine from selling commercial banks reserves as credit  resources; --banning commercial banks from issuing loans to  loss-making companies; --ensuring positive borrowing rates  (credit policy); --banning the Finance Ministry from  deficit-funding government expenditures; --raising the velocity  of money; --adopting the practice of seeking guarantees from  foreign parties for payments to Ukrainian exporters;  --abolishing state orders for foreign purchases; --and,  establishing a system of economic sanctions for the sale of  Ukrainian goods abroad at dumping prices.    To implement monetary reform when inflation is stopped.    2. The introduction of the hryvnya    2.1. Before the hryvnya is introduced, a stabilization fund  should be created, to consist of:    --hard currency revenues from the sale, by international  tender, of unfinished construction projects (based on the state  privatization program); --short-term hard-currency loans from  the population (for the period of 2-to-5 months); --assistance  from the International Monetary Fund; --and, golds and precious  stones mined in Ukraine.    2.2. To build capacities in Ukraine for:    --stamping coins, printing money and producing special paper  and ink.    2.3. To introduce the hryvnya at the start of mass  privatization.    3. Privatization.    3.1. To implement privatization in a very short time period  by subscription to stocks and property through a single computer  network and a unified data bank, which will ensure that:    --privatization is not an uncontrolled grab for property;  --corruption is eliminated from the entire process; --all  citizens of Ukraine have equal access to property, independent  of location of the property or place of residence; --due to  cross-ownership among east and west and north and south,  separatist tendencies are reduced and interethnic tension  diminished; --investment is attracted along with privatization;  --citizens are compensated for the loss of the purchasing power  of money stemming from inflation (by payment in kind); --the  privatization process is quickly completed, thus improving  stimuli for better work; --citizens' social security is taken  care of (with the distribution of property), giving them an  opportunity to enrich themselves and the state; --the high level  of exploitation and one of the main sources of inflation is  liquidated, which is connected to the gap between labor input  (or produced output) and wages (at private and stock companies  salaries are considerably higher than at state enterprises);  --and, at the same time, the responsibility of all workers for  satisfying consumer demand for goods and services is increased.    4. Division of power and responsibility at different  levels of power.    4.1. The central government will retain the responsibility  for:    --international relations, macroeconomic policy, defense,  basic scientific research and control over the implementation of  the constitution and the laws.    4.2. The regions will retain the responsibility for:    --local economy and protection of civil order.    4.3. The regions and the central government will bear joint  responsibility for:    --education, culture, health care and environmental  protection.    4.4. The enterprises will have the responsibility for:    --applied research;    --creation of national income; improving efficiency of  economic activity;    -- competition and bankruptcy; analysis and forecasts of  market conditions;    -- independent creation of domestic and foreign economic  ties, prices, range of products and services they intend to  provide and disposition of profits as well as forms, methods and  level of wages (total freedom of enterprise);    -- and, the environment.    4.5. Budgets and revenue base will be distributed in  accordance to articles 4.1. to 4.4. (budgetary independence).    4.6. The regions will be subordinate, accountable and  responsible to the central authority in areas which are funded  from the general state budget, in issues of upholding Ukrainian  laws and in the implementation of reforms.    4.7. While balance in relations between them is being  reformed, mutual support by the legislative and executive power  should be bolstered by means of:    a) limiting the authority of the President of Ukraine to the  functions of the head of state;    b) the President of Ukraine has the responsibility of  appointing the Prime Minister, with the consent of parliament;    c) after its nomination by the Prime Minister, the entire  Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine is to be confirmed by the  Supreme Council of Ukraine;    d) if a government resigns, the Supreme Council will  immediately suspend its own authority (new elections). This  clause will increase the responsibility of the Ukraine Supreme  Council both for nominating the Cabinet of Ministers and for  cooperating with it (for the state of affairs in the  government). Local authorities will function similarly.    5. To ensure reliable social security for the  population.    5.1. For the pensioners:    --by providing pensions equal to 70 percent of workers'  wages; stopping migration to Ukraine by pensioners who are not  Ukraine citizens; and, providing special assistance to the  handicapped and the poor.    5.2. For large families (poor), to provide child assistance  in kind to bring them up to the poverty level.    5.3. To eliminate the negative consequences of the rise in  unemployment (beyond the existing system of payments to the  unemployed):    a) to eliminate absolute unemployment (when the number of  existing jobs is smaller than the number of people in the  workforce), by means of:    --first, extending maternity leave for mothers until the  child reaches the age of up to six years. In this case, all  budgetary expenditures on preschool care should be passed on to  mothers. This approach will help achieve other social goals: the  child will get more education and care in the family; --family  upbringing and care will reduce disease, improve moral aspects  of child rearing and strengthen ties and mutual understanding  between children and parents;    --second, increasing the number of jobs for underemployed  professions using funds from the budget; --and, third,  establishing and developing market infrastructure by  transforming unemployed collectives into marketing and  monitoring services, market study groups, brokerage houses,  banks, etc.;    b) to eliminate relative unemployment (if in the country  overall the number of jobs is greater than the number of people  in the workforce):    --regional unemployment (in cases when unemployment exists  in  one region while another suffers from a labor shortage) will be  eliminated by means of an accelerated privatization of housing  and creation of a housing market. In this case, the unemployed  will be able to sell their housing in the region where there is  unemployment and buy it where there is a labor shortage. This  approach does not require budgetary expenditures; --skills and  professions-related unemployment (in cases when a region has job  vacancies but job requirements call for different skills or  professional qualifications than those possessed by the local  unemployed) can be eliminated with the help of budget funds (an  unemployment fund) and funds from enterprises, by providing  professional retraining for the unemployed. In this area,  organizational work will be provided by the Ukraine employment  service, once it gets the necessary authority.    5.4. To repay domestic debts to Ukraine citizens.    a) To compensate citizens for the loss of value of their  savings by means of:    --transferring state property in the course of  privatization,  with the help of privatization certificates, and indexing  average annual account balances and using them as funds for  privatization.    b) To repay USSR state obligations, by means of:    --exchanging them for Ukrainian state debt (when it is  issued); --indexing the obligations and transforming them into  possible means of payment in privatization; --and, in the next  four years, repaying in cash the indexed value of the  obligations to those citizens who decide not to use them as a  means of payment in privatization.    c) To repay winning claims in cash and property lotteries of  the former USSR, by means of:    --repaying monetary prizes in the course of four years,  based  on the actual value of property that has been won.    5.5. While implementing reforms, to ensure their social  orientation in the following areas:    --income growth; --increase in the living standard;  --opportunities for family vacations, including also abroad;  --protection for economic interests of individuals; --social  security for individuals; --protection for the family;  --inviolate right to housing and other property; --reduction of  the fiscal responsibility of the state for individuals and  businesses; --development of the paternalistic concern for  workers on the part of enterprises; --freedom to choose  employment and to dispose of property; --and, environmental  protection.    6. Reform of the agricultural sector.    6.1.1. To divide productive land into three categories.    6.1. Reform of land property rights should be carried out  based on the following division:    --first, land that lies fallow (where kolkhozes and  sovkhozes  have been dissolved) or where there is no productive population;  --second, land that belongs to functioning kolkhozes and  sovkhozes which have no hope of repaying their debts; --and,  third, land that belongs to economically viable kolkhozes and  sovkhozes.    a) Land of the first category should be leased to everyone  who is willing to become a farmer, for a period of five years.  If in five years they become efficient producers, their land  will be given to them free of charge, as their property. If they  are unable to obtain projected yields for the crops that they  cultivate (productive exploitation), they would be able to  purchase that land or it would be leased to others for the  period of five years;    b) kolkhozes and sovkhozes functioning on land of the second  category should be offered to divide their land and property, so  that those who wish could leave them and become independent  farmers. Other kolkhoz members could use their shares to set up  cooperatives, collective farms or proprietor and shareholder  associations. If members of a kolkhoz agree to this type of  reform, the state will assume (write off) its hopeless debts. If  they do not, such kolkhozes will be declared bankrupt and their  property will be leased to those who wish to become independent  farmers (in accordance to the process described in Article  6.1.a.);    c) collective farms functioning on land of the third  category  will not be reformed or reformed only with the consent of their  labor collectives (to prevent the repetition of the mistakes of  1930-33, when strong farms and farmers, those who fed the  country, were liquidated). However, all agricultural management  entities will be eliminated (RAPO, OAPO and others), and  agricultural workers will become entirely free and independent  in their economic activity. After reform, land owners will  decide themselves, in the conditions of a free market and  competition, what is the best form of organization for  agricultural production: some farmers will join together and  perhaps some kolkhozes will split up (of those belonging to the  third category of land), but it will be as the result of the  natural choice and needs of the owners themselves.    6.1.2. Diversification of farm activities.    It is a known fact that underdeveloped nations sell raw  materials and not finished goods. The same is true in farming.  For example, in November 1993 the state bought 1 kilo of meat  for K9,000 and sold 1 kilo of sausage (made of 2 kilos of meat)  for K100,000.    We propose:    a) in 1994, at the initial stage of reform, to instruct the  processing industry to pay for processing agricultural raw  materials with a share (of up to 25 percent) of finished output.  (So that up to 75 percent of prepared sausage, butter, sugar,  etc. will revert to agricultural enterprises. By selling  finished products, agricultural workers will considerably  improve the financial health of their farms.)    b) To order from the military-industrial complex (where  capacities remain idle) a required quantity of small-scale but  fully automated meat processing, butter producing, cheese  making, vegetable preserving (canning) and baking plants which  would be built on the countryside. To transfer (or auction) some  stores to the agricultural sector. In this case, all the profits  which today accrue to purchasing, transportation and processing  entities, as well as wholesale and retail trade, will go to  producers not of meat and corn, but of finished products (i.e.,  sausage, butter, etc.) on the countryside. In this case, workers  on the countryside will no longer need subsidies: their farms  will be highly profitable.    c) Financial assistance for the countryside.    Existing countryside subsidies in the budget should be  retained, for the following purposes:    --to order fully automated plants for the processing of  vegetable and animal products (for the time period necessary to  the countryside to build up its own processing base); --for the  purchase of agricultural machinery for newly created farms (for  a period of one year); --for the purchase of mineral fertilizers  and means of chemical protection of crops (herbicides,  defoliants, insecticides, etc.) for a period of two years  following reform; --subsequently, financial subsidies would be  redirected to the development of the social infrastructure.    d) To develop full and wasteless processing of agricultural  products on the countryside:    --feathers, hides, horns, hooves, etc., with the goal of  improving the efficiency of production.    7. To safeguard economic security of Ukraine by means  of:    --diversifying the supplier base; --diversifying markets for  Ukrainian output; --diversifying entities involved in foreign  business activity; --diversifying functions of enterprise;  --building up state supplies and reserves; --freeing up  enterprise; --reorienting domestic production toward import  substitution; --adopting protectionist policies; --intensifying  exploration of domestic deposits, including also of energy  sources; --developing energy production using domestic sources;  --introducing new, alternative sources of energy; --developing  export potential of Ukraine; --de-monopolizing the economy and  encouraging competition; --stabilizing the monetary system and  introducing currency convertibility; --banning the sale of  Ukrainian territory; --improving the living standard of the  population by means of reform; --the banking system; --business  relations; --the payment system; --state economic regulation;  --and, development of property market infrastructure.    8. Economic management in the state sector.    8.1. a) The enterprise manager in the state sector of the  economy will be hired on a contract basis and is the only and  plenipotentiary representative of the state (as the owner of the  property) at the enterprise. He organizes the work of the  enterprise within the limits of, and based on, existing laws of  Ukraine; --contract provisions and conditions set by the state  property fund.    Within the constraints set by contract provisions and  conditions set by the state property fund, the manager bears  sole and personal responsibility before the Ministry of the  State Sector of the Economy.    b) The manager hires all enterprise employees on a contract  basis and can fire any of them for violating contract provisions  or based on a court decision.    c) The following indicators of efficiency of the use of  state  property will be used:    --productivity growth rate; --growth rate for return on  capital; --growth rate for competitive output production;  --relationship between growth rates of the salary fund and of  output, in comparable prices; --indicators of reorientation of  the Ukrainian economy; --import-export balance; --share of  output sold domestically in Ukraine.    8.1.2. The Ministry of the State Sector of the Economy has  no  right to:    --establish managerial superstructures over the enterprise;  --require the manager to provide any information, excluding  specified statistical data; --insist on the implementation of  any orders relating to the economic and financial, business or  scientific and technological activities of the enterprise;  --change conditions of the contract with the manager; --remove  the manager if he carries out contract provisions, if the  enterprise conforms to established indicators and if the  activities of the manager and the enterprise are in accordance  with existing laws and fulfill the requirements of the state  property fund, based on specified conditions.    8.1.3. The state property fund determines for the manager:    --the share of the property that can be used as a  collateral.  Agreements which exceed the share limit set by the fund are  declared null and void at the time of their signing; --and,  targets for privatizing enterprise property.    8.1.4. In connection with the transfer to the Ukraine  Cabinet  of Minister of responsibility for managing the property of the  state, to create the Ukraine Ministry of the State Sector of the  Economy, the main functions of which will be:    --to establish, reorganize and liquidate state enterprises  and to approve their statutes; --to hire and remove enterprise  managers, in accordance with Ukraine laws and contract  provisions; --and, to organize the implementation of planned  annual inspections of enterprise financial and economic  activities in order to exercise control over effective use of  state property. Inspections may not exceed 20 calendar days.    8.1.5. In every enterprise, a supervisory committee will be  established, comprised of three persons drawn from its  employees, who will function as representatives of, and will be  appointed by:    --the Ukraine Ministry of Finance, the state property fund  and the Ministry of the State Sector of the Economy.    The supervisory committee at every enterprise will be set up  by the joint decision of the above-mentioned organizations.  Members of the supervisory committee can function as such at  several other enterprises (excepting competing enterprises).    Members of the supervisory committee must be appraised of  all  contracts of the enterprise, instructions from the manager and  financial documents; --they will supervise compliance with laws  and contract provisions and analyze the effectiveness of the  utilization of property in accordance with the established  indicators. When violations are uncovered, they will be  obligated to report them to those organizations that have  appointed them. Members of the supervisory committee will not be  allowed to ask for information from the manager and other  enterprise executives or demand explanations from them, but will  be able to submit requests for additional information. Members  of the supervisory committee will not have the right to give  orders to the manager and enterprise employees, but can provide  optional advice.    Members of the supervisory committee will not be allowed to  divulge, orally or in writing, any information which concerns  any aspects of enterprise activities, expect to the  organizations by which they have been appointed. Those guilty of  disclosure of information will be prosecuted.    8.2 Macroeconomic regulation.    8.2.1. Activities in the economic area will be divided as  follows:    a) the state will not intrude in any way in the business and  financial activity of enterprises (state no more than private  ones). The state will not be involved in trade (either domestic  or foreign). Those functions will be fully transferred to  enterprises.    b) The state will influence the economic situation in the  country only by interest rate, credit, exchange rate and  monetary policies, reserve requirements, tax rates and  protectionist policy, as well as by means of quotas, preferences  and sanctions.</p>

			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> MIRA COSTA CRUSHES REDONDO, 34-8  </P> <P> Mira Costa kept its slim playoff hope alive and must now wait until Sunday to  hear about possible postseason play by dominating Redondo, 34-8, in an Ocean  League contest Thursday at Redondo High.  </P> <P> The CIF at-large committee will meet Sunday morning to determine Mira Costa's  future as a Division VII at-large entry.  </P> <P> Senior running back Mike Clairemont rushed for 159 yards and two first-half  touchdowns in the easy win. His first score was set up by a 53-yard  interception return by Bill Stock.  </P> <P> Clairemont's 22-yard touchdown with 3:34 remaining in the first period opened  the scoring for Mira Costa. Clairemont scored again in the second period on a  seven-yard run as the Mustangs led at halftime, 17-0.  </P> <P> Mira Costa opened the second half with a 12-play, 60-yard drive capped by Jose  Cervantes' one-yard run to build the lead to 24-0.  </P> <P> Mira Costa's defense completely bottled up the Sea Hawks, forcing two  interceptions and piling up five quarterback sacks. The Sea Hawks' only score  came with 4:03 left in the third quarter on a three-yard run by Steve Delis to  finish an 80-yard drive.  </P> <P> Sea Hawk quarterbacks completed three of 13 passes for 33 yards, and standout  running back Antoine Humble was limited to 85 yards, 80 in the first half.  </P> <P> Mira Costa finished the season at 4-3 in Ocean League play and 6-4 overall. The  Sea Hawks ended at 3-3-1 and 4-5-1.  </P> <P> South Torrance 35, North Torrance 7 -- Quarterback Kevin Fitzpatrick rushed for  four touchdowns and passed for a fifth to help the host Spartans clinch second  place in the Ocean League and a berth in the Southern Section Division VII  playoffs.  </P> <P> Fitzpatrick rushed for 84 yards on 13 carries and completed five of nine passes  for 85 yards as South ended the regular season with a 5-5 overall record and  5-2 league mark. The victory snapped a two-game losing streak.  </P> <P> Fitzpatrick passed to Brian Lee for a five-yard touchdown and ran nine yards  for another score in the first quarter.

Tokyo correspondent,  John (Shuverland), reports on the findings by the Ministry for  International Trade and Industry [MITI].

According to  MITI, the Australian Government is breaching the terms of the  government procurement agreement reached as part of the GATT.    The Japanese Government says Australia has been a frequent  user of antidumping measures and the reports says from a legal  standpoint, the termination of injury to local industry has been  questionable. It says the criteria for real estate investment  is unclear and a barrier to development. MITI also cites  Australian broadcasting laws restricting foreign commercials and  direct investment.

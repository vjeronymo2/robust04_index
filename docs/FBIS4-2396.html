			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Xie Jinhu (6200 6855 5706)] </F>   [Text] Shanghai, 8 Apr (XINHUA) -- Hu Ping, director of the  State Council's Special Economic Zone [SEZ] Office, said after  his inspection of the Pudong district: From now on, the  development of special economic zones should shift from relying  on preferential policies to relying on their own functions.    After a nine-day inspection, Hu Ping described Pudong's  development and opening up as having very good momentum and  being full of promise. He said: SEZ's should compete with one  another in their development and opening up. Relying on  preferential policies in development and opening up was a  historical step of the past. Of course, the existing  preferential policies will remain unchanged, but SEZ's should  rely on their own functions in development hence. Pudong, as  China's largest development zone, is making efforts to do so.  For instance, it is taking a further step to improve  foreigners' living environment, including providing a better  shopping environment for foreign employees' wives and first-rate  educational facilities and faculty for their children. These  are the developments of their own functions, in relying on a  superior environment of intangible factors to attract more  investors.    Hu Ping said: The State Council has all along supported  Pudong through its loan policy, and this support will not  change. However, the development of Pudong has been proceeding  very rapidly, and attention should be paid to making effective  use of limited funds. I do not think that the present  difficulties concerning a shortage of funds will affect Pudong's  speed of development.</p>

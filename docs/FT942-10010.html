			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / International Capital Markets: India takes tough line on companies seeking capital India yesterday announced tough new guidelines for Indian companies tapping the international capital markets in an effort to channel funds into priority areas such as power, high technology and industrial modernisation. The guidelines codify and extend ad hoc decisions the finance ministry has made since Indian companies were first permitted to launch international issues in late 1992 as part of economic reforms. In the most significant measure, the ministry will permit companies to borrow only for three specific purposes - the financing of capital goods imports, the financing of domestic plant purchases and its installation, and the repayment of earlier foreign loans. Companies will therefore not be allowed to raise money simply to increase cash holdings or to repay domestic borrowings, as some companies which have raised funds in the past 18 months have done. The ministry has been concerned about reports of companies using the proceeds of Euroissues to invest in the domestic stock market. Companies will be permitted to retain Euroissue proceeds abroad only for specific purposes. Companies in low-priority industries such as consumer goods and financial services will need Foreign Investment Promotion Board approval for Euroissues. Companies in power and other high-priority sectors will not require such approval. To avoid increasing India's external debts, companies will not normally be permitted to issue convertible bonds unless the proceeds are used to restructure existing debts. Companies will be permitted only one issue for every financial year and the large groupings which dominate Indian industry will be allowed only two issues per grouping. There will also be a minimum gap of 12 months between two issues by the same company.</p>

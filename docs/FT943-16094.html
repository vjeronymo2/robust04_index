			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Unfavourable comparison Sir, After reading John Postgate's diatribe against religion ('Religion: are we better off without it?', June 18), it was refreshing to read in the same issue about another scientist, Conway Morris, who trusts his intuitions in non-scientific as well as in scientific matters. Postgate's case might have been stronger if he had not judged religion by its worst representatives and science by its best. Fundamentalists are no more characteristic of the best in religion than are cheats and frauds representative of the best in science.

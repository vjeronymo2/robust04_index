			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A flagrant incident occurred at the border with  Yugoslavia. The Public Order Ministry spokesman reports that at  about 1335 today another flagrant incident happened in Pogaj  village in Has District, near border marker D/7.    A Yugoslav border unit, accompanied by dogs, opened fire  toward two Albanian children who were guarding their cow,  without going beyond the border line, but close to it. As soon  as the shots were heard, the commander of our border post,  together with a soldier, left immediately. But with no warning  at all, the Yugoslav post of Goruzhup, in former Yugoslavia,  opened fire against our border guards, who were 100 meters away  from the border line and approximately 350 meters away from  their post. Soldier Saimir Pal Zefi from Mirdite District was  wounded from these very sudden shots.    This is a very flagrant event because there was not even the  slightest provocation or pretext from our part. Our member of  the joint local commission for solving border incidents and  representatives of EC observers mission went immediately to the  scene of the incident.    The Public Order Ministry strongly protests these criminal  and unjustifiable acts that are increasing day by day.</p>

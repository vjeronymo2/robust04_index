			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Uncertainty is the only certainty - Heron bondholders meet again on interest deferral Only one thing is certain when Heron International's bondholders meet again this morning to vote on a deferral of bond interest. This time there will be a quorum. When they first met, on March 31, holders of only 35 per cent of the bonds voted. The quorum was 50 per cent. Today the quorum is only two bondholders. The conclusion of the votes, though, is by no means sure. A yes vote would mean that the interest payment, which was due on March 31, would be deferred to June 30. But there is a strong chance that bondholders will vote no. However, a no vote has become almost irrelevant to Heron. Events at Mr Gerald Ronson's property and trading group have moved on since it originally warned bondholders in March of a 'significant potential for cross defaults' if they did not vote in favour of the deferral. After the March 31 meeting Heron was technically in default on the bonds. But investors did not require the trustee to take action for early payment of the bonds and the Heron empire did not collapse. Instead, Heron is embroiled in another full scale restructuring of its balance sheet, only months after the completion, last September, of a refinancing of its then Pounds 1.4bn of debts, which included a swap of some bank debt into equity, and the replacement of other bank debt and existing bonds with new bonds. Inevitably, the second restructuring must bring more equity into the group. Mr Basil Vasiliou, who chairs Vasiliou &amp; Company, a New York debt trader which, with other Wall Street houses, reckons to speak for about 20 per cent of the senior bondholders, argues that 'the solution is very apparent'. He advocates swapping all Heron's remaining debt into equity, and then arranging a listing for the shares which would provide liquidity for lenders seeking a cash exit. However, bank lenders are unlikely to find that an attractive route. Many banks still have both a philosophical and a balance sheet problem with taking equity, even though in Heron's case senior bank lenders have already had 70 per cent of their debt exchanged for equity and can now see their remaining senior debt trading at about 45p in the pound. A listing could take some time to arrange, and might not be possible until 1996 or 1997, although some off-market transactions, for example allowing banks to sell shares to institutions, could take place first. A less attractive, but more likely solution, is that a bidder comes in to buy all the group's debt and equity. Heron's preferred option seems to be that a bidder would provide a cash exit for those lenders wanting to realise and give others a continuing equity interest in the group. A bid is likely to be worth substantially less than the 70p in the pound of assets which Heron has to cover its Pounds 300m of senior debt, and nearer the 45p where that debt is trading. But it would be more than the 30p or so that a receiver might recoup. As one interested party observes: 'Cash is always more persuasive than equity in a bank's short-time horizon', and cash of 45p now might be more attractive to banks than 70p in the medium term, and the possibility of even more later. UBS, Heron's adviser, is understood to have found good interest among a range of potential bidders from venture capitalists to wealthy property investors. Already some are said to be doing due diligence investigations and Heron is believed to be confident that a firm offer will be available for board consideration by the end of May. That should enable proposals to be put to creditors by the end of June. Whether or not the present management would be kept on by a new owner is another matter, though many creditors, Mr Vasiliou included, are supportive of Mr Ronson and his team. With the prospect of a bid in view, a no vote at today's meeting would not result in bondholders demanding action from the trustee. Rather, bondholders are tempted to vote against the deferral as a protest at the behaviour of one of Heron's groups of bank lenders. These are the lenders to the Heron Corporation (HCP) subsidiary which are seen to be obstructing the passing of Pounds 70m of cash in HCP to the 'head office' company which would more than pay the bondholder's interest. These lenders, of which about half are also lenders to the 'head office' group, have a right to complete repayment of their loans before any cash is 'upstreamed' to the parent. The 40 HCP lenders are enforcing this right, although HCP has assets reckoned to be worth at least twice its debts, and the lenders have already been repaid substantial amounts early. These include Pounds 150m paid last November which was due in March this year, and a Pounds 67m payment last week of Pounds 160m due next March. While Heron's future should soon be secured, some doubt must remain while groups of creditors with differing interests continue to fight in public.</p>

			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Books: Rewriting the myth of the last Empress - Sterling Seagrave's latest iconoclastic look at recent Asian history DRAGON LADY: THE LIFE AND LEGEND OF THE LAST EMPRESS OF CHINA by Sterling Seagrave Macmillan Pounds 20, 384 pages WHAT Indiana Jones is to archaeology, Sterling Seagrave is rapidly becoming to contemporary history. The product of four generations of Americans in Asia, he spent his childhood in the Burma/China border country and his young manhood as a journalist rattling around the region with an insouciant air, elastic-sided boots and a whiff of good intelligence contacts. His years as a journalist have stood him in good stead now he has turned to the business of biography, for he has an eye for a riveting angle and a good, iconoclastic story. He destroyed the remaining American myths surrounding anti-communist Asian allies in The Marcos Dynasty, and in the swashbuckling Soong Dynasty, biographies of three clever ladies, one of whom married a Shanghai triad gangster and became Madame Chiang Kai-shek. But journalistic enthusiasms can tempt the writer into sensationalism and polemics, even into a refusal to allow facts to interfere with a good story. The impact of the Marcos book was diluted by too many pages devoted to a wild goose chase after speculations that the ruling pair had acquired the rumoured Yamashita gold, and elsewhere a readiness to go beyond the findings of (admittedly impressive) research has provided plenty of fodder for critical academics and nit-pickers. In recompense, Seagrave's books boast a non-academic verve and narrative sweep. The Dragon Lady is devoted to the thesis that Tsu Hsi, the Dowager Empress who ruled China for a disastrous 47 years (during which the country fatally failed to respond to the challenges of the West and of modernisation) was not, as popularly supposed, a murderous, scheming tyrant who strangled domestic reform and backed China's chauvinistic 'ironhats' against the 'outer barbarians.' Seagrave would have us believe that Tsu Hsi was a charming lady, immured within the Forbidden City by destiny, dynastic pressures, ambitious princes, reactionary mandarins and scheming eunuchs - 'a woman at the mercy of her advisers, swayed first one way, then the other.' Seagrave makes an impressive attempt to blame the historic distortions surrounding her on a mad fantasist and forger, Sir Edmund Backhouse, the Peking foreign community's guru and co-author of what was thought to be the most authoritative account of Tsu Hsi's reign. Backhouse's lack of any credibility, his spite and (in spite of his homosexuality) his pornographic descriptions of imagined couplings with Tsu Hsi herself, were exposed in 1978 by Professor Hugh Trevor-Roper in his book Hermit of Peking. But Seagrave claims Trevor-Roper failed to carry his findings to their logical conclusion and reject Backhouse's verdicts, especially on Tsu Hsi and the Chinese capital's palace politics. Seagrave must break many other icons in making his case. The first to go is the legendary, and non-Chinese-speaking, Dr George Morrison, Peking correspondent of The Times, who let Backhouse colour or even file many of his dispatches which shaped public opinion and later research. Another Backhouse dupe was the same newspaper's man in Shanghai, JOP Bland, who also bowed to the fraud's claimed access to court sources and imperial documents. But thereafter Seagrave meets the problem of all polemicists: any voice dissenting from the theory must be explained away or dismissed as valueless. Even those on the side of the angels must be cast aside: evidence of China's reformers, chief among them Kang Yu-wei, the first protagonist of Neo-Confucianism (which advocated combining China's traditional virtues with progress and modernisation) is discounted as the bile of disappointed, largely exiled, victims of court intrigue. The later republicans and communist revolutionaries had their own good reasons for maligning the imperial record (did not Mao Zedong himself comment knowingly that China's experience of female leaders was not a happy one - although he probably had his own wife in mind?). Seagrave argues that posterity has only listened to the voices of those who fell under the Backhouse spell; the rest were shouted down or maintained a hypocritical silence. It is all possible, and Seagrave makes a good, if sometimes overstated, case for his picture of a well-meaning, dutiful lady guiltless of the crimes and errors that littered her reign. But he cannot prove his case: the very secrecy enclosing the Court which enabled Backhouse to peddle his forgeries denies Seagrave the evidence for rebuttal. And Seagrave fails to ask the question basic to all mysteries: cui bono? Who profited from the deaths of the boy-emperors on whose behalf she was regent? Who was most threatened by the the barbarians' ideas of democracy? Looming behind such questions are matters of greater moment which Seagrave does not probe: Tsu Hsi tragically failed to see beyond the confines of China's walls and to pierce its illusions of centrality and cultural self-sufficiency. These nurtured its unwillingness to learn from or respond to the ideas and inventions convulsing the world outside China's frontiers. Across the sea, an equally shattering and constrained monarchy had nevertheless produced the Meiji emperor, and Japan learned the foreign technologies quickly enough to share in the dismemberment of the Ching Empire. Whether she was victim or villain, the Dowager-Empress Tsu Hsi was symptomatic of China. Today, her dynastic successor Deng Xiaoping occupies her throne in the Forbidden City, vainly replaying her role as a Chinese King Canute, ordering back the tides engulfing the outside world. Marina Warner's 1972 biography, The Dragon Empress, will be re-issued as a Vintage paperback in October (Pounds 6.99).</p>

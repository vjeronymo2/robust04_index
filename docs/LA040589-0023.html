			<p><P> April 5, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CHARGERS ARE SEEING DOUBLE;  </P> <P> EXHIBITION SCHEDULE HAS THEM PLAYING TWICE IN THREE DAYS  </P> <P> The Chargers will take a whirlwind tour of California in August, playing two  exhibition games on the road in three days because of scheduling conflicts, it  was announced Tuesday.  </P> <P> The Chargers are scheduled to play the Rams in Anaheim on Monday, Aug. 21, at 8  p.m., then travel to Candlestick Park for a game against the Super Bowl  champion San Francisco 49ers on Wednesday, Aug. 23 at 6.  </P> <P> The Chargers will open the exhibition schedule with a nationally televised game  against the Dallas Cowboys Sunday, Aug. 13, at noon. The Padres, who originally  left Aug. 12 open for a possible football exhibition game, will move their  scheduled Aug. 13 game against the Atlanta Braves to the 12th at 7:05.  </P> <P> (Padre ticket-holders for the 13th have three options: Aug. 13 tickets will be  honored Aug. 12th on a same-seat basis; Aug. 13 tickets may be exchanged before  Aug. 12 for a game of choice, excluding concert dates, or full face value of  the tickets will be refunded.)  </P> <P> The Chargers were forced into the unusual near-doubleheader because the Rams  and 49ers did not get the same kind of cooperation from the Angels and Giants.  </P> <P> "We were scheduled (by the National Football League) in weekend two to be in  Anaheim and weekend three in San Francisco, but both came up unavailable," said  Jack Teele, the Chargers' director of administration. "So we had to take the  dates that were available."  </P> <P> Teele said that Aug. 17 was open at Anaheim but that the Angels wouldn't  approve the date, exercising a 36-hour clause that prohibits any event from  taking place at Anaheim Stadium 36 hours before a scheduled Angel game. He said  there was a similar hangup between the Giants and 49ers.  </P> <P> "In a spirit of cooperation, the Chargers and Padres have played within 12  hours (of each other)," Teele said.  </P> <P> Charger Coach Dan Henning was on a scouting trip and could not be reached for  comment. Rick Smith, the Chargers' public relations director, said the team  would normally have 60-65 players available for each game at that time of the  preseason.  </P> <P> The Chargers will conclude the exhibition schedule against the Phoenix  Cardinals Sept. 1 at 7 p.m. at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. It will be the  first time since 1980 that the Chargers have had fewer than three exhibition  games at home.  </P></p>

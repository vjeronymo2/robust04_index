			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE'S RULING FOR APARTMENTS WILL STAND  </P> <P> Glendale officials have decided not to appeal a Superior Court ruling that will  force the city to process three applications to build about 60 apartments and  condominiums, City Atty. Scott H. Howard said Tuesday.  </P> <P> The city rejected the housing developments after a building moratorium was  enacted in 1988. Judge Edward M. Ross ruled last month that because the  moratorium was declared illegal in court, the city had no right to continue to  turn down the developers.  </P> <P> City officials vowed to appeal, fearing that the judge had opened the door to a  flood of development proposals based on less restrictive 1988 building rules.  </P> <P> But Howard said Tuesday that there will be no appeal because Ross' ruling  affects only the three projects listed by the Moratorium Litigation Committee,  which brought the matter to court.  </P> <P> A second building freeze, adopted legally in 1989, is set to end in December.  </P></p>

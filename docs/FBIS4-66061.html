			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, May 27 (AFP) -- Italy's new Foreign Minister  Antonio Martino rebuked French President Francois Mitterrand for  saying that there was a risk of major changes to democracy in  Italy under a coalition which includes neo-fascists.    Martino told reporters on the fringes of the Conference on  Stability in Europe here that Mitterrand's comments about the  presence of the neo-fascist MSI [Italian Social Movement] in  media magnate Sivlio Berlusconi's government were "unacceptable".    He recalled that Mitterrand himself had in 1981 criticised  those who carped at the presence of communists in his cabinet.    Berlusconi's office put out a statement Thursday [26 May]  saying that there was nothing fearsome or equivocal about  Berlusconi's coming to power.</p>

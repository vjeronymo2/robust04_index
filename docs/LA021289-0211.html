			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE COLLEGES;  </P> <P> BASEBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> AGGRESSIVE FULLERTON GETS STANFORD ON RUN  </P> <P> Cal State Fullerton's baseball team stepped slightly out of character Saturday  with a 5-2 victory over Stanford in a nonconference game in front of about 800  at Titan Field.  </P> <P> Fullerton came in with one stolen base in its first three games but stole two  against Stanford, both leading to runs. The Titans also had a runner picked off  and two more thrown out trying to steal.  </P> <P> "We were trying to be a little more aggressive than normally," Fullerton Coach  Larry Cochell said. "We wanted to put the pressure on the defense by trying to  make things happen."  </P> <P> The Titans' final bit of aggressiveness resulted in their last run in the sixth  inning.  </P> <P> With one out, Rod Klopfer singled and moved to second on a balk. He stole third  and continued home when Stanford third baseman Roger Burnett had the throw from  the catcher go off his glove for an error.  </P> <P> Klopfer's run gave Fullerton a 5-1 lead. Fullerton had scored a pair of runs in  the second to lead, 2-1, and two more in the third for a 4-1 lead.  </P> <P> For seven innings, the lead was well protected by starter Huck Flenner, a  sophomore left-hander, who allowed only one run.  </P> <P> But in the eighth, Flenner tired. After his second walk of the inning, he was  replaced by Sam Colarusso, a junior right-hander from Orange Coast College.  </P> <P> Colarusso walked Tim Griffin to load the bases with two outs, then threw a wild  pitch to allow a run. He fell behind David Holbrook, three balls and a strike  before getting him to fly to Trevor Neighbors in right field to end the inning.  </P> <P> Colarusso got a pair of strikeouts in the ninth as he retired Stanford for his  first save. Flenner (1-0) allowed four hits and four walks and had seven  strikeouts for Fullerton (3-1).  </P> <P> The first sign of Fullerton's willingness to run came in the second when Ralph  Ramirez stole second on a broken hit-and-run play. It was the first steal for  Ramirez at Fullerton. Ramirez, a senior from Orange Coast College, did not  steal a base in 42 games last season.  </P> <P> Ramirez scored from second when Mate Borgogno lined a bad-hop double to center.  </P> <P> Bobby Jones time an off-speed pitch from Stanford starter and loser Ben Keyser  and hit it well over the left-field fence for his first home run of the season  to open the third inning.  </P> <P> Neighbors followed with a single and later scored on a groundout by Ramirez to  give Fullerton a 4-1 lead. Rich Gonzales had three hits for Fullerton, which  had nine. Stanford (4-5) had four hits.  </P> <P> The Titans will try to complete a sweep of Stanford in the three-game series at  5 p.m. today at Fullerton.  </P></p>

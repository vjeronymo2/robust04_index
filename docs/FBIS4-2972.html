			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 15 (CNS) -- Vice Premier and  Minister of Foreign Affairs Mr. Qian Qichen met the director of  the Hong Kong newspaper TA KUNG PAO, Mr. Wang Guohua, and the  chief editor, Mr. Tsang Tak-shing, at the Diaoyutai State Guest  House today. Mr. Qian was also interviewed on this occasion on  a number of issues covering Hong Kong, Taiwan, the international  community, and China's foreign affairs.    On the Hong Kong issue, Mr. Qian pointed out that a  breakdown  of negotiations between the Chinese and the British sides mainly  affected the transition of the legislative body but not the  administrative structure because it is subject to a major  change, including the replacement of the administrative head but  not the general civil servants. The legislative body should  have remained intact through to 1997 but now it will have to be  reelected. Other matters will be handled in accordance with the  Basic Law and the Sino-British Joint Declaration. This meant  that it was just a partial breakdown while the "one country two  systems" will be adopted.    Mr. Qian said further that there would be no direct  transition of the three-tier assembly to be seen in the 1994 and  1995 elections to be held unilaterally by the British Hong Kong  Government. It was, he said, up to the future special  administrative region to set up another administrative structure  by holding another election which would be based on the Basic  Law and on the actual situation at that time.    Mr. Qian said that hopefully a steady transition was  possible  with concerted efforts by the Hong Kong people.</p>

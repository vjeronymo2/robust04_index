			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / International Company News: Forte may seek Pounds 85m refinancing FORTE, the UK leisure group, may have to find Pounds 85m to refinance a maturing Eurobond issue with warrants exercise-able into Forte shares. Mr Donald Main, Forte's finance director, said the group would finance the redemption from existing facilities, but plans to return to the bond markets after the general election, to top up liquidity. The need to refinance has arisen as a result of the company's weak share price. Forte's share price is currently languishing 3p below the warrants' exercise price of 226p. Unless the share price rallies quickly, the warrants will expire worthless. If exercised, the warrants would provide Forte with ample funds - Pounds 93m  -to redeem the bonds. The Pounds 85m issue of 10 3/4 per cent bonds launched in February 1987, matures next month. The warrants expire on March 10, but investors normally have to advise the relevant clearing houses, Euroclear and Cedel, about a week in advance if they intend to exercise the warrants into shares. Forte is considering raising around Pounds 150m through an issue of seven-year bonds, according to Mr Main. The company has not yet decided on a currency sector, which will depend on market conditions at the time of the issue. Forte is also looking at hotel acquisitions in Europe and would consider a rights issue to fund such acquisi-tions. The company's current gearing is 44 per cent, with the company forecasting a slight increase to Pounds 1.3bn by the year-end.</p>

			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Parental payments to students decrease The introduction of student loans has allowed a cut in the contributions which parents make towards university education, according to a survey published yesterday by the Department for Education, John Authers writes. It found the average cost paid by parents fell by 19 per cent between 1988-89 and 1992-93, with 57 per cent of parents paying more than their formally assessed contribution and 3 per cent paying less. Only 6 per cent of students' income came from earnings. Over the period the proportion of students from the 'AB' socio-economic groups fell from 55 per cent to 49 per cent, which the department interpreted as evidence that loans had not deterred children of poorer families from applying to university.</p>

			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN PLEADS GUILTY TO ATTACK WITH NEEDLE  </P> <P> A 38-year-old Northridge man pleaded guilty Thursday to sexual battery in  connection with an incident in which authorities said the defendant used a  livestock needle to inject a woman with unknown substances.  </P> <P> Fernando Ramos was originally charged with assault with a deadly weapon and  another count of sexual assault in the Feb. 24 incident involving a 30-year-old  Chatsworth woman. Those charges, however, will be dismissed as part of a plea  agreement, Deputy Dist. Atty. Meredith Rust said.  </P> <P> The victim met Ramos when he answered an ad she placed in a newspaper seeking a  roommate, according to court documents. Ramos told the woman he was a  registered nurse and a professional masseur and offered to treat her for back  pain, the documents said.  </P> <P> Ramos injected the victim with the high-gauge veterinary needle while pinning  her down and sexually assaulting her, Rust said. Authorities were unable to  determine what substance was used in the injection.  </P> <P> Ramos is free on $20,000 bail and was ordered to return to court on June 8 for  sentencing. Rust said she will seek a minimum of six months in County Jail and  three years probation.  </P></p>

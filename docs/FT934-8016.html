			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / International Company News: Backing a champion in China - Profile of an HK telecoms group with important inroads to the mainland As the darling of the Hong Kong telecommunications sector, Champion Technology can do no wrong. Founded in 1987 by Mr Paul Kan, a computer software engineer formerly employed by Cable &amp; Wireless of the UK, and taken public in August last year, Champion is a bet - so far one-way - on China's future. The company is already regarded by Hong Kong telecoms analysts as the purest China telecommunications 'play' in the market. More than 90 per cent of the company's HKDollars 298.6m (USDollars 38.5m) revenues accrue from the sale of its multi-lingual Kantone radio paging systems to China. And the system is reckoned to give Champion a three-year technological edge over US and Japanese electronics giants Motorola and Matsushita. Mr Andrew Harrington, telecoms analyst at Salomon Brothers in Hong Kong, says: 'Champion is a concept stock. If you believe that the market in China will open up to foreign investment - which I do - then Champion will be a major beneficiary. It has the golden combination of contacts and expertise.' Last week, Champion made an agreed Pounds 21.5m (Dollars 31.8m) bid for Multitone, the UK inventor of the electronic pager. The acquisition should bring much needed resources to developing Champion's business, especially on the mainland. 'We have a lot of business in China,' says Mr Paul Kan, chairman and chief executive. 'But we are constrained by people, resources and capacity. There are not many paging companies around that we can buy. They invented the pager and I'm the father of the Chinese language pager, so it's a natural fit.' Champion makes its money in China from selling, installing and maintaining pager systems and pagers in cities. Under current regulations, it is unable to own equity in a paging network, although in most locations it shares in the revenue generated by the system. Currently it has 15 systems on the mainland, with an aggregate pager capacity of 300,000 units, of which only 60,000 have been supplied. By the end of the century, it hopes to have installed 100 systems with a capacity of 2m pagers. Mr Kan is the first to admit his company is a high-risk investment. Of his deals in China, he freely acknowledges that 'everything is not well-defined', and that there is 'no proper regulatory framework' underpinning his agreements with partners. However, what gives analysts confidence in Champion is its two-fold secret of success on the mainland. It has expertise and technology, which allows it to market its pager. Most importantly, however, it has contacts, especially with China's military and public security apparatus, which controls many of the country's radio frequencies. Mr Kan is reluctant to talk at length about his contacts with the People's Liberation Army, (PLA), saying that in many countries the military is involved in business. But when pressed he says: 'They are very business-like; in fact they are just like ordinary businessmen. But their companies are good to deal with because they have a lot of clout. They can give quick decisions and help speed up procedures like import licenses.' And his contacts go straight to the top or, at least, near to it. Mr Kan last week presented a report to the Chinese government about how it should liberalise its telecommunications market. He gave the report to none other than Mr Wan Li, 77, a veteran Communist party leader and supporter of economic liberalisation - and Mr Deng Xioaping's favourite bridge partner. Champion's future in China would be assured if it could meet its ambitious plans for the expansion of its pager network. However, the company has set its sights much higher, and wants to be involved in the mainland's telephone system as well. This year it became the first foreign company to invest in a domestic telephone network on the mainland. It has taken 40 per cent of a mobile communications network in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan, China's most populous province with an estimated 110m population. In doing so, it circumvented existing prohibitions against such investment by standing one removed from day-to-day operation of the network. Its partners in the deal - which will entail an investment by Champion of up to USDollars 30m - are the local branch of the ministry of post and telecommunications (MPT) and the PLA. In addition to capital, Champion has provided technology and expertise to the joint venture, for which it will receive 40 per cent of the profits. These could be large. China has to date prohibited foreign investment in the operation of telecommunications networks. It is for this reason that Mr Kan emphasises his company will not operate the Chengdu mobile network - which he says should be ready for testing by the end of this year - only design the system and procure equipment for it. However, pressure is building on Beijing to allowed foreign investment in networks.</p>

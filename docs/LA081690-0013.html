			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHEN IRISH EYES ARE SMILING;  </P> <P> CULTURE: PROGRAM PLACES IRISH CATHOLIC, PROTESTANT STUDENTS IN U.S. HOMES. THE  AIM IS TO BUILD FRIENDSHIPS THE TEEN-AGERS CAN TAKE BACK TO THEIR STRIFE-RIDDEN  HOMELAND.  </P> <P> Jean Anderson and Joanna McLaughlin giggled and agreed about the high points of  their trip to Southern California: sunny weather, a ride in a  telephone-equipped Mercedes, and pizza -- with lots of pepperoni.  </P> <P> In fact, the only thing the two 14-year-olds said they really disagree on is  who gets the shower first in the morning.  </P> <P> Over the past six weeks, Jean and Joanna have become fast friends while staying  with the family of Sierra Madre residents Sharon and Bill Duffy. But back home  in Belfast, Northern Ireland, their different religious backgrounds might have  prevented them from ever speaking to each other.  </P> <P> Joanna, who is Catholic, and Jean, who is Protestant, are two of 95 students  ages 14 to 17 who are staying with American host families in the United States  this summer as part of a program designed to foster cultural understanding --  and build lasting friendships -- among Catholic and Protestant teen-agers from  strife-ridden Northern Ireland.  </P> <P> Jean and Joanna are among six Northern Ireland teen-agers visiting California  this summer as part of the Children's Friendship Project for Northern Ireland  Inc. The others are four boys who are staying with host families in Westlake  Village and Simi Valley.  </P> <P> Since its founding in 1987, the project has arranged for about 390 boys and  girls to spend six weeks with host families in the United States as a sort of  grass-roots approach to an age-old conflict, said Peggy Barrett, 60, the  nonprofit organization's national president in Manheim, Pa.  </P> <P> "A lot of (participants) change their way of life. Even their parents . . . get  to know one another and become friends," said Barrett, who was born in Brooklyn  but grew up in Northern Ireland.  </P> <P> Host families pay all of the students' expenses in the United States, including  air fare to and from Northern Ireland. Typically, the host family must raise  about $2,000. Since the organization is nonprofit, the expenditures are  tax-deductible.  </P> <P> Sharon Duffy said she decided to initiate her own fund-raising campaign after  learning about the program through a notice in the newspaper on St. Patrick's  Day, 1989.  </P> <P> Of Irish descent herself, Duffy said the benefits of the program have been well  worth her time and money. Jean and Joanna have virtually become part of the  Duffy family, which already includes two boys and a girl, she said.  </P> <P> "It's a responsibility, but for what you're getting in exchange, you can't put  a money value on that," Duffy said. "Now it's starting to be kind of sad  because they're going home. I don't know how many years it will be before we  get to Northern Ireland, but we will, and when we do we'll stay with them.  </P> <P> "I'm sure that we'll have a lifelong friendship."  </P> <P> In addition to tourist attractions, Duffy has taken Jean and Joanna to a Sierra  Madre City Council meeting and a local courthouse to show the girls "how our  system of government works."  </P> <P> Duffy also arranged for the girls to go on a ride-along with a Sierra Madre  police officer, and she has taken them both to her Catholic church for Mass  each Sunday.  </P> <P> Jean, a Protestant, said she found Mass very similar to other religious  services she has attended. "There's only one God," she said.  </P> <P> The program also requires host families to introduce visiting teen-agers to a  local police and fire department, and encourages other civic-oriented field  trips as well. The idea is to show the students how authorities operate in the  United States.  </P> <P> "After a few weeks, they remark about how there's no stop points, no barbed  wire around police stations," Barrett said.  </P> <P> Over a diet soda on a recent hot afternoon at an ice cream parlor in Sierra  Madre, Jean said that if more students knew about the program, "there would be  a long list. Everybody wants to come to America."  </P> <P> Project organizers hope that the teen-agers will forge lasting friendships that  will one day have a healing effect in Northern Ireland.  </P> <P> "We think the only way to start is through the children. And they deserve more  than what they're getting," said Eileen Kane, the organization's Northern  Ireland coordinator. "If we can touch them and start to change their attitudes,  hopefully, 10 years down the road, this will have real impact."  </P> <P> Jean, who is a touch gregarious, and Joanna, who is slightly shy, say they will  write to the Duffys and stay in contact with each other after they return home  tomorrow. "We're all going to remain friends," Jean said matter-of-factly.  </P> <P> And that, Kane said, is what it's all about.  </P></p>

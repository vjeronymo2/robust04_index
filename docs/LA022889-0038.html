			<p><P> February 28, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY ROUNDUP: NEWHALL LAND &amp; FARMING LAUNCHES UNIT BUYBACK  </P> <P> Newhall Land &amp; Farming in Valencia launched a buyback of up to 2 million,  or 10%, of its ownership units in a transaction that could be valued as high as  $112 million.  </P> <P> Newhall, a real estate and agricultural concern, is organized as a master  limited partnership whose units are publicly traded on the New York Stock  Exchange.  </P> <P> On Monday, the company began a so-called Dutch auction tender offer, whereby  Newhall unit holders who tender can specify the price they want within a range  of $50 to $56 a unit. After the offer closes, Newhall will select a price  within that range for payment to unit holders who tendered at or below that  price.  </P> <P> The offer is part of Newhall's previously announced settlement of a  class-action lawsuit that was brought by several dissident unit holders last  year. As part of the settlement, Newhall agreed to buy back at least $40  million of its units.  </P></p>

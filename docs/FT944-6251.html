			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Public Spending): Subsidy freeze disappoints - Farming Farmers' leaders last night expressed disappointment that government subsidies to hill farmers would be frozen next year rather than being raised after cuts of about Pounds 50m over the past two years. The hill livestock compensatory allowances are paid to more than 60,000 farmers in upland areas covering half Britain's farmland. The Hill Farming Initiative, a lobby group, said the government's decision to freeze the allowances at Pounds 105m was 'a false economy'. Mr William Waldegrave, agriculture minister, justified the freeze by saying overall subsidies to livestock farmers in less favoured areas, most of which come from Brussels, would rise by Pounds 50m to more than Pounds 600m next year. The farmers' union also described as 'very disappointing' the abolition of grants for waste-handling facilities, a move that will save about Pounds 8m next year. Farmers have received more than Pounds 148m in grants since 1989, and serious incidents of pollution have fallen from 99 in 1991 to 63 last year. The grants will be reintroduced in the new nitrate-vulnerable zones, but these are expected to cover only 650,000 hectares. Another disappointment, according to Mr Graham Latham, agriculture specialist at accountants Grant Thornton, is that willow and poplar coppice  -environmentally friendly crops being grown for fuel - will be taxed as commercial woodland. But Mr Latham identified two pieces of good news for farmers: capital gains will be eligible for tax relief if they are reinvested in the farming company, and farmers will be able to offset losses on farm cottages against profits on land.</p>

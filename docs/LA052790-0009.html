			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: 'KNEE' SURGERY  </P> <P> Noted author Michael Herr ("Dispatches," the just-out "Walter Winchell") has  signed on to rewrite "Wounded Knee," which producer Christopher Mankiewicz at  one time hoped to have in theaters by Dec. 29. That's the 100th anniversary of  the infamous confrontation between the 7th U.S. Cavalry and Sioux at Wounded  Knee Creek on South Dakota's Pine Ridge Reservation, which left 153 Indians  dead, many of them women and children.  </P> <P> But the WGA strike and other circumstances intervened, and Mankiewicz tells us  he'll now be happy to be in production by that date.  </P> <P> Tab Murphy (who co-wrote "Gorillas in the Mist") wrote the first script,  telling dual stories: the 1973 occupation of the historic battlefield by  American Indian Movement militants, who were under siege by government troops  for 71 days; and a risky airlift of supplies to the stranded activists by a  bunch of "average white guys" from Chicago.  </P> <P> Mankiewicz calls Murphy's draft "a first-rate action adventure script" that  needs a more serious, socially conscious tone -- Herr's task. "We're trying to  use the overall structure of Murphy's script but emphasize the Indians' story .  . . re-balancing to the Indian point of view. It's a drama of a culture trying  to survive and maintain its identity, a struggle that continues today."  </P> <P> The Warner Bros. feature, one of a number of films in development focusing on  American Indian culture, is not related to author Dee Brown's "Bury My Heart at  Wounded Knee," a project that Marlon Brando and others have tried  unsuccessfully to turn into a film over the years.

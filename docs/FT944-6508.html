			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Prospect Inds rises 2% in difficult conditions Prospect Industries, the power station engineering and maintenance group, saw profits edge up 2 per cent to Pounds 5.17m before exceptional items in the year to September 30. Mr Philip Wilbraham, chairman, said that trading conditions in the UK remained 'extremely difficult' with no immediate prospect of improvement. But he added: 'Competitors such as Babcock and Senior have both lost money in our sector and I don't see managements of their quality allowing that to continue.' Group turnover rose 16 per cent to Pounds 67.4m but margins slipped, partly reflecting the costs of expansion overseas. US profits fell to Pounds 128,000 (Pounds 333,000) on turnover of Pounds 8.55m (Pounds 5.1m). Last month, Prospect acquired Whessoe's lossmaking piping systems division for Pounds 11.7m in shares with the aim of accelerating its international development. Its UK-based business is now being integrated with Prospect at a cost of between Pounds 750,000 and Pounds 1m. Prospect's gearing, which was 108 per cent at the end of the period, has been cut below 50 per cent following the acquisition and share issue. After exceptional items, including a profit of Pounds 736,000 on the sale of the final tranches of the Graystone loan note, pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 5.91m (Pounds 4.02m). The company's brokers, Peel Hunt, forecast a rise to Pounds 8.5m this year. Adjusted earnings per share were 2.01p (1.93p) and the final dividend is 0.56p giving a total for the year of 0.85p (0.8p) - up 6.25 per cent.</p>

			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Bank succeeds with republican coup CENTRAL bankers from the republics of the former Soviet Union will enrol in London today on a special two-week Bank of England seminar. The Bank's Centre for Central Banking Studies - sometimes known as the Old Lady's Academy - is expecting to play host to the heads of 10 of the 15 central banks set up since the collapse of the Soviet Union, including those of Russia, the Ukraine and Kazakhstan. Senior representatives of three other central banks from former Soviet republics will attend the course. It will be the first time the heads or their representatives of the republics' central banks will have met abroad since the break-up of the USSR. Subjects to be covered include monetary policy, the creation of separate currencies, currency convertibility and the development of financial markets. Relations between fiscal policy and monetary policy, banking supervision and press relations are also on the agenda. The Bank believes it has achieved something of a coup in attracting nearly all the former Soviet republics' top central bankers to a single event. Providing the former eastern bloc with central banking knowhow, and the influence that goes with it, has become a highly competitive field, with foreign central banks such as the German Bundesbank and Austrian National Bank also playing an active role. The Bank has provided training for staff of other central banks since the 1950s. In September it set up the Centre for Central Banking Studies to meet increased demand for such training after the demise of communism in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.</p>

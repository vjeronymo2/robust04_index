			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / International Bonds: Strong Eurodollar bond market surprises traders THE STRENGTH of the dollar bond market so far this year has taken many market participants by surprise. At the end of last year, many analysts were pointing to a shift in asset allocation from US to European bond markets during 1992. The strong rally in the US Treasury market fuelled by a one point discount rate cut to 3 1/2 per cent has delayed this, and many European investors returned to their desks after Christmas to find they had missed a two point rally in bond prices. In spite of a setback to the US bond market at the end of last week, few market participants believe the recent surge of demand for Eurodollar bonds has been quashed. The sell-off may be welcomed as a buying opportunity by some investors. Pent-up demand for dollar securities has been exacerbated by the lack of current coupon paper: that is, most Eurobonds and US Treasuries are trading substantially above par value, as a result of the price rally. Many investors do not like to pay premium prices, which represent a built-in capital loss - since the bonds will ultimately be redeemed at par. This partly accounts for the strong performance of Eurobond spreads relative to US Treasuries. The Eurobond market has defied the conventional wisdom that yield spreads widen in a rallying market. Spreads of top quality Eurobonds are tighter than ever before. The World Bank's Dollars 1.5bn 10-year global offering, launched last week at a spread of 15 basis points above the comparable US Treasury, quickly tightened to a margin of six basis points. In the past, Eurobonds have traded at yields close to, or even below, US Treasuries usually because of demand from retail investors, who do not generally assess value in spread terms, or due to technical reasons, such as tax advantages. Investors will accept much smaller margins as they expect rates to fall further and because the dollar is now widely seen to be bottoming out. Japanese investors in particular like to buy dollar securities when the dollar is weak, positioning themselves for currency gains. Some dealers argue it is logical for spreads to contract now that yields are at such low levels, since the spread represents a correspondingly larger proportion of the total yield. Demand has been exaggerated by the readiness of traders to take on inventory, partly because banks and securities houses share investors' optimistic views, but also because the positive yield curve in the dollar bond market allows them to hold bonds cheaply. They are able to fund positions in bonds, which pay interest of about 7 per cent, by borrowing at overnight rates of, say, 3 3/4 per cent. (The shape of the yield curve is also encouraging investors to shift out of money markets and into bonds.) But in the heat of their enthusiasm for winning dollar business, underwriters may be pushing spreads too hard. Demand remains selective, concentrated among top quality borrowers, and some corporate deals are faring less well. Five-year deals for BOC Group and Abbey National Treasury Services launched last week both widened from their launch spreads. The deal which set the market trembling was a Dollars 500m 10-year offering for Credit Local launched on Friday and due to be priced today. The indicated launch spread for the transaction is 28 basis points above the comparable US Treasury market. The pricing reflects lead manager Deutsche Bank's positive view on the market. Most dealers felt the issue would rely on attracting demand through a further improvement not only in prices, which is generally expected, but also in spread performance, which seems less sure. Some traders believe there is room for spreads to tighten further, predicting that the World Bank's global offering and the European Investment Bank's recent deal will soon be trading at the same yield as, or below, the comparable US Treasury market. There is certainly room for hope that the Eurobond market will outperform the US corporate bond market. Last week, the Eurodollar bond market absorbed a hefty Dollars 4bn of fresh supply. But the US corporate bond market has been deluged with record levels of supply, with a massive Dollars 12.4bn last week, and Dollars 7.75bn the previous week. But if lack of supply has been a significant factor in the tightening of margins, spreads may have only one way to go: out.</p>

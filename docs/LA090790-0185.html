			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> COLLEGE FOOTBALL NOTES;  </P> <P> MIAMI VS. BYU: DUEL OF HEISMAN HOPEFULS  </P> <P> Miami opens defense of its national championship Saturday in Provo, Utah,  against the preseason favorite for the Heisman Trophy -- Brigham Young's Ty  Detmer -- in what could be one of the better TV games of the season.  </P> <P> Miami safety Darryl Williams admits that Detmer "is pretty good" but goes on to  say: "But he's a long way from being great. A long way. I want him to prove how  good he is."  </P> <P> In quarterback Craig Erickson, Miami has a Heisman Trophy candidate of its own.  The Erickson-Detmer duel begins at 4:30 p.m. Saturday on ESPN.  </P> <P> Two years ago, the teams ended the regular season in Miami with a 41-17  Hurricanes' victory, and in a reserve role as a freshman, Detmer was  intercepted three times and fumbled at the goal line in a 16-for-27, 212-yard,  two-touchdown effort.  </P> <P> CAVS' BIG CHANCE -- Virginia gets its chance Saturday to show it belongs in the  high-rent district of the Top 10. The Cavaliers play host to Clemson, seeking  their first-ever victory over the Tigers in 30 tries, in what is being called  the biggest game in Virginia football history.  </P> <P> Officials said they could have sold 70,000 tickets for the game in 42,000-seat  Scott Stadium.  </P> <P> Fact is, 14th-ranked Virginia does not have another powerful team on its  schedule (Navy, Duke, William and Mary, North Carolina State, Wake Forest,  Georgia Tech, North Carolina, Maryland and Virginia Tech), and a triumph over  No. 9 Clemson would set up the Cavs as a strong candidate for the national  championship.  </P> <P> ENTANGLED IN HIS OWN WEBB -- Among the ramifications of Tennessee running back  Chuck Webb's season-ending knee surgery is that he will probably not be able to  turn pro after this season, which he was considering. That means he'll have to  go to college for another year and a half while rehabilitating his knee, then  attempt to prove in 1991 that he's back to his old self.  </P> <P> Before the season, he admitted that a shot at pro football was what was keeping  him in school.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't lie to you and say I like going to college," he told reporters. "I  don't wake up with a smile on my face saying, 'I get to go to English class.' "  </P> <P> BRUINS IN HIDING -- UCLA coach Terry Donahue has closed practice lately, saying  injuries to his defense have forced the Bruins to make some schematic changes  in preparation for the season opener Saturday against No. 23 Oklahoma.  </P> <P> Defensive end Rocen Keeton is out for a month with a knee injury and the other  starting defensive end, Mike Chalenski, has been practicing sporadically  because his bad shoulder keeps popping out of place.  </P> <P> NOTABLE -- After a seven-year hiatus from the depths of winless despair,  Northwestern returned to its roots in 1989 with an 0-11 season and enters 1990  with a 12-game losing streak -- second longest in the nation among Division 1-A  schools, trailing only New Mexico State's 18.  </P></p>

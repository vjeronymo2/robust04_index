			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Delaney rid of loss divisions DELANEY GROUP has been left with its Christies Panel Products fitted bedroom retailer following its shopfitting division going into receivership and the sale of its furniture division. The directors believed that without its loss making businesses Delaney could begin to advance again. The shares, which were suspended last Thursday pending the announcement, fell 1p to 8p when dealings were resumed. Melton Medes, which holds 12 per cent of Delaney, has made a loan of Pounds 800,000 repayable at the end of this year and secured on the shares of Christies. Delaney called in the receiver following the collapse of negotiations for the sale of companies in the shopfitting division - Display and Shop Equipment, Lawn Shopfitters, Halon Electrical Contractors, Northgate Aluminium Systems and Multiflex (MSC). At the same time Stanley Wood and Traditional Furniture Stores, which made up the furniture division, were sold to Mark Billings for Pounds 4. The resulting write off was estimated at Pounds 1.15m. The shopfitting division was blamed for many of Delaney's problems. The furniture division reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 780,000 on sales of Pounds 2.23m in the 11 months to November 30.</p>

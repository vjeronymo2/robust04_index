			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / International Company News: Michelin injects FFr2bn into unit MICHELIN, the world's largest tyre manufacturer, is to inject FFr2bn (Dollars 357m) of capital into its French manufacturing division before the end of the year. The capital increase will be achieved through a restructuring of shareholding arrangements between the group's financial and French manufacturing divisions and will not involve the raising of capital from outside the group. The proceeds will be used to reduce debt at the manufacturing operation which has suffered from a sharp decline in demand in the European tyre market. The group as a whole, which had a first-half net loss of FFr3.19bn, has net debts of about FFr30bn.</p>

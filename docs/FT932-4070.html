			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Flexible hours plan proposed for Germany MR Gunter Rexrodt, the German economy minister, yesterday called for changes in the national labour laws to enable more flexible weekly working, easier regulations for shift- and night-working, and more relaxed rules on Sunday and holiday working. In a special statement issued by his ministry - appropriately enough on a day when most of the country was away from work for the religious festival of Corpus Christi - Mr Rexrodt spelt out six principles he intends to include in an amendment to the current employment legislation. Changes in the labour laws - dating from 1938 - are a key element in Mr Rexrodt's campaign to raise German competitiveness, and improve the country's attractiveness for foreign investors. He said new rules must make it possible to increase the number of hours during which equipment and machinery is operated in German factories - currently standing at a lower level than for any other leading industrialised nation. He proposed: more flexible rules to allow deviation from maximum weekly working hours, with a longer period allowed for workers to compensate for overstepping the current limits; abolition of the ban on women working night shifts, already outlawed by the constitutional court; flexible Sunday and holiday working to cater for leisure pursuits of the majority, and to save jobs and create new ones; more flexible hours for process working and research and development activities; more flexibility in wage contracts to cope with special circumstances. 'German enterprises must be in a position to adjust their working hours flexibly to the demands of a modern industrial society,' Mr Rexrodt said. Trade unions have served notice, however, that they are mistrustful of efforts to ease working time regulations.</p>

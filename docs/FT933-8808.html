			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Leading Article: A scrap over aluminium BACK IN March, when the west was in one of its periodic funks about Russia, the European Commission extended a gesture of support for President Boris Yeltsin: an offer to negotiate an eventual free trade zone with his country. It was a generous acknowledgement of the overriding importance of exports to Russian economic reform. Last Saturday, the Commission sent out a contradictory signal by discreetly announcing a strict limit on imports of aluminium from the Commonwealth of Independent States until November. Is the EC - as a furious Russian government and industry allege - now showing the true meaning of its free trade promises? Does Saturday's announcement signify, as did previous moves against eastern European steel and agricultural goods, that Brussels is prepared to open up its markets to all products apart from those in which the countries to the east have a real comparative advantage? The answer in this case, at least for now, is: not necessarily. The Commission insists that it had to act against a sudden and highly disruptive surge of heavily subsidised aluminium exports from the CIS. The import restriction, it says, constitutes a temporary measure, designed to secure for Europe's aluminium industry a 'breathing space' in which negotiations can take place with the governments concerned. That low-cost CIS exports - produced with ludicrously cheap energy and highly subsidised credit - are disrupting the west European market is not in doubt. Between 1989 and 1992, as the aluminium-using industries of Russia and the other republics collapsed, imports jumped from virtually nothing to an estimated 9 per cent of EC consumption. This year, as the quantity has grown further, prices have tumbled, stocks have soared and Community producers have cried out for assistance. Because Russia has yet to be admitted to Gatt, its trading partners have no ground rules under which to seek redress. But were Russia a member, the EC might well have a case. Indeed, the Commission says it has been trying to achieve an accord establishing transparent pricing and orderly marketing - as well as providing for EC assistance towards modernisation of CIS aluminium smelters. Such is the chaos in Moscow, however, that it has not even been able to obtain precise statistics on the volume of aluminium now leaving the former Soviet Union. Nevertheless, it is questionable whether this week's move represents the most effective way of securing such an agreement. In the first place, it seems to have angered other aluminium producers almost as much as those in the CIS itself. The US industry, in particular, fears that the flood of cheap metal will simply be diverted from western Europe in its direction. What is needed is multilateral co-operation, not unilateral enforcement. Second, there is a danger that short-term sanctions could turn into longer-term protection for an industry that still needs to cut costs in western Europe and America. Western governments and industries are bound to be unsettled by Russia's transition to a market economy. But in such an economy, Russia will almost certainly have an advantage in aluminium production. Rather than seeking to insulate the EC from the side-effects, the Commission should make speeding that transition its highest priority.</p>

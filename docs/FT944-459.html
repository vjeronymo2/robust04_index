			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / International Capital Markets: Syndicated lenders take another look at covenants as pricing nears the floor - Loans have become a cheap alternative to bonds this year. Martin Brice looks at prospects for 1995 THE big issue in the syndicated loans market this year has been pricing, as margins have fallen by up to 50 per cent. The questions for 1995 are whether pricing will fall further, and whether covenants will become weaker. Although bankers are divided on the direction of pricing, one thing is certain. If margins fall any further, banks will start paying borrowers to take out loans. As one banker said last week: 'We are close to the floor now. There is not much room for movement.' As for covenants, while some bankers expect to see weaker structures, others are not so sure. 'What won't happen this time around in the economic cycle is a dramatic weakening of covenants,' said one banker. 'People have learnt from some pretty ghastly experiences in the recession, so they will compete on price.' The fall in pricing has been most evident in loans for strong, respected names. Some bankers expect this movement to transfer to names not rated so highly. 'While liquidity remains strong, there remains strong pressure on pricing for lesser quality credits,' said one market participant. On the question of pricing, the jumbo loan for Sweden and the Ecu6bn deal for Spain set benchmarks. The Spain deal was priced at 4.25 basis points for the facility fee and a margin of 4.5 basis points over the London interbank offered rate (Libor). This level of pricing raised eyebrows, but within months even this margin had been cut, with Citibank and JP Morgan arranging Dollars 6bn for Sweden at a facility fee of 4 basis points and a spread if drawn of 4 basis points over Libor. The fall in pricing has been rapid; as one banker at another house said: 'Margins have come down faster than we expected.' Bankers behind the Dollars 6bn syndicated loan for Sweden are planning a dinner to celebrate the completion of the deal. Appropriately, as Sweden voted to join the European Union this year, they plan a trip on Eurostar, the Channel Tunnel train, to Brussels. 'Good luck to them,' said a banker not involved in the deal. However, bankers are not the only people with cause to celebrate that loan, which was unquestionably a benchmark deal in the international lending market. The Riksgalds Kontoret, or Swedish National Debt Office, also has cause to celebrate. It now has a total of Dollars 6bn available from 46 banks, for a total annual fee of just Dollars 2.4m. Sweden will use the money to pay off two more expensive existing loans, of which around Dollars 1bn is outstanding, so this loan means Sweden starts the year with Dollars 5bn in reserve. Since its borrowing requirement for 1994 was around Dollars 24.5bn, it seems well placed for 1995. If the rocky ride in the bond markets continues, we may see Sweden return to the syndicated lending market for funding. If it does, observers will be very interested to see what price it pays. Corporate borrowers from Scandinavia have also been active this year in the loans market, where they can now get prices similar to those prevailing at the end of the 1980s, when 25 basis points over Libor was available. Televerket of Norway and Vattenfall of Sweden have secured funds this year at around 19 basis points over Libor, and bankers point out that last year they would have had to pay around 40 basis points over. Borrowers coming to the loans market to escape bruising in the bond markets is likely to be a feature of 1995. Italy is one area where uncertainty in the bond market may prompt borrowers to access the market for international credits. NatWest Markets has recently arranged a deal for Finmeccanica, the big Italian state-owned engineering group, thereby opening up the Italian corporate sector of the syndicated loans market after a gap of several years. This deal was priced at 40 basis points over Libor. Another feature of 1994 has been the reappearance of Japanese banks, which have fought aggressively for loans. Although this may have had an effect on the fall in pricing, a glance at the names of banks in syndicates for loans shows that their influence is not overbearing. As one banker said: 'There is no question that Japanese banks have been active, but it (the fall in pricing) is global, not just a specific part of the investor world.' Other bankers point to the names in both the Sweden and Spain deals this year, where apart from domestic banks, there were 28 institutions from eight countries involved. The list for the Dollars 1.5bn loan for Airbus Finance shows that of the 49 banks in the deal, only 13 are Japanese. This deal, arranged by JP Morgan, was launched into syndication as a Dollars 1bn loan but attracted commitments of more than Dollars 2.3bn, and was increased to Dollars 1.5bn. The Airbus Finance deal is notable in that the loan is guaranteed by the four parents of Airbus until the long-term unsecured and unguaranteed debt of Airbus Finance is rated at A1 or A+ or equivalent by two credit rating agencies. At that point the guarantee ends. As a banker said: 'Pricing has continued to fall and structures (covenants) continue to get weaker. We are at the stage where margins on high quality credits are wafer thin. This is a cyclical problem with the syndicated loans market and I don't expect any change from other cycles. There will be loan losses, and margins will rise.' However, one borrower for whom margins are unlikely to rise for the next five years is John Lewis, the UK retailer. NM Rothschild has arranged an innovative Pounds 140m facility which allows the company to lock in at existing rates, during the life of the five-year facility, which is limited to a core of banks which already have a relationship with the company. A banker close to the deal said: 'If the market continues to improve in its favour, the company will get the benefits.' Another benchmark deal was the Pounds 350m loan for East Midlands Electricity, the UK power utility, which was priced at a facility fee of 7 basis points on the undrawn portion of the loan and a margin of 15 basis points over Libor on the drawn part of the loan. Although widely regarded in the market as a deal too far at the time, nevertheless the loan was completed. A banker close to the deal said: 'It met resistance but it was done.' While the deals for Sweden and Spain set benchmarks, a deal for Thai International Airways has raised eyebrows. This 10-year, Dollars 115m loan guaranteed by the Thai Ministry of Finance is believed to be priced at Libor flat, leaving banks with little if any profit. 'This is just absurd. We have our mouths open in amazement. The market has gone berserk again,' said one banker. One person giving the impression of keeping his feet firmly on the ground among all this is Mr Walter Shipley, chairman and chief executive of Chemical Bank, a leader in the syndicated loans market. Mr Shipley has said publicly that Chemical is prepared to lose its dominance of the US market in loans rather than yield to pressure for looser terms. This raised eyebrows among competitors, since Chemical is perceived to set some of the most aggressive terms for loans. His concern on covenants was shared by the Bank for International Settlements, which, in its November quarterly report on financial market trends, highlighted the rise in popularity of loans. The report said: 'The high volume of loanable funds stimulated competition to win business: the average maturity of loans was increased, spreads charged over inter-bank rates were reduced and covenant clauses were further relaxed.' The report also said institutional investors' reluctance to commit funds at fixed interest rates for long periods led an increasing number of lower-rated or lesser-known borrowers to turn to syndicated loans. This has led some market participants and regulators to caution against the risk of a reversion to the low credit standards which prevailed in the late 1980s. As one observer said last week: 'It would be nice if bankers had longer memories.' However, he added: 'There are too many banks in the world and there is too great a supply of money compared to weak demand.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------             ARRANGERS OF INTERNATIONAL LOANS 1994 (DOLLARS BN)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------    name                                amount       number  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1  Chemical Bank                        15.79         95 2  National Westminster Bank            14.48        168 3  Citicorp                             11.75        120 4  Barclays Bank                        11.15        108 5  ABN-Amro Bank                         8.46         92 6  JP Morgan                           7.76         54 7  Deutsche Bank                         7.43         78 8  Hongkong Bank/Midland Group           7.18        119 9  CSFB/Credit Suisse                    6.50         36 10 Union Bank of Switzerland             6.20         79 11 Chase Manhattan Bank                  5.88         84 12 Chiao Tung Bank                       5.52          1 13 Sumitomo Bank                         5.08        124 14 Bank of America                       4.69         67 15 Bankers Trust                         4.67         37 16 Banque Indosuez                       4.44         38 17 Societe Generale                      4.41         70 18 SmithKline Beecham                    4.00          4 19 Fuji Bank                             3.99        107 20 WestLB Group                          3.36         78 21 Enskilda Corporate                    3.30         27 22 Grand Metropolitan                    3.10          1 23 IBJ                                   3.03         42 24 Lloyds Bank Capital Markets           3.00         57 25 Banque Nationale de Paris             2.92         30 26 Bank of Nova Scotia                   2.91         13 27 Credit Lyonnais                       2.65         45 28 Swiss Bank Corp                       2.20         14 29 Hill Samuel Bank                      2.19         33 30 Dresdner Bank                         2.09         32 31 Standard Chartered Bank               1.97         59 32 Sanwa Bank                            1.96         66 33 Commerzbank                           1.91         33 34 Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank                  1.86         55 35 Bank of Tokyo                         1.83         39 36 Bank Bumiputra Malaysia               1.83          7 37 Royal Bank of Canada                  1.81         11 38 Mitsubishi Bank                       1.73         59 39 International Finance Corp            1.71         49 40 Toronto-Dominion Bank                 1.67          7 41 ING Bank                              1.66         34 42 NM Rothschild &amp; Sons                1.62         20 43 Sakura Bank                           1.51         39 44 Malayan Banking                       1.46         21 45 Schroders                             1.36         18 46 Royal Bank of Scotland                1.31         35 47 Argentaria                            1.21         11 48 Hanson                                1.15          1 49 NationsBank                           1.10         10 50 Bayerische Landesbank                 1.07         30  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Signed loans only.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Euromoney Loanware.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

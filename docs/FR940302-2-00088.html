(``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below, which items have been prepared by the Amex. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Amex proposes to modify the trading hours for options on its Biotechnology Index (``BTK''). The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, the Amex, and at the Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its filing with the Commission, the Amex included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Amex has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Currently, Exchange rules generally provide that, except as otherwise indicated or under unusual conditions, the trading hours for broad-based index option contracts shall be from 9:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Four narrow-based index options (Computer Index, Oil Index, North American Telecommunications Index, and the Pharmaceutical Index) presently have trading hours of 9:30 a.m. to 4:10 p.m. The BTK, although narrow-based, currently has trading hours identical to those assigned to the Exchange's broad-based index options. The purpose of the current proposal is to modify the trading hours for options on the BTK from a 4:15 p.m. New York time close to a 4:10 p.m. New York time close. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Amex believes that market professionals (including the specialist and market-makers) in BTK options are exposed to undue risk during the five-minute interval between the closing of equity options at 4:10 p.m. and the closing of BTK options at 4:15 p.m. Unlike specialists and market-makers in broad-based index options who can hedge their positions in the index futures market (for which trading terminates at 4:15 p.m. New York time), market-makers in a narrow-based index option such as BTK are best able to hedge their risks by taking or liquidating positions in options on the individual securities that comprise that index. However, since trading in equity options terminates on the Amex and on other option markets at 4:10 p.m. New York time, the Amex believes that Specialists and market-makers in narrow-based index options (such as BTK options) who are required to maintain a trading market until 4:15 p.m. are unnecessarily exposed to market risk during the five-minute interval between the closings of equity options and BTK options. The Exchange also believes that the proposed change will eliminate potential investor confusion by creating uniform trading hours for all narrow-based indexes on the Exchange as well as with other options markets. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Amex has stated that, upon Commission approval of the rule change proposal, it will provide its membership with notice two weeks prior to effecting the change of trading hours. The Exchange will issue an information circular advising the membership of the new closing time that will be sent by facsimile to the Exchange's contacts at the major options firms, mailed to recipients of the Exchange's options related information circulars, and made available to subscribers of the Options News Network. See letter from Claire P. McGrath, Managing Director and Special Counsel, Derivative Securities, Amex, to Sharon Lawson, Assistant Director, Office of Self-Regulatory Oversight, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, dated February 22, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and furthers the objectives of section 6(b)(5) in particular, in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade and prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Amex does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any inappropriate burden on competition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

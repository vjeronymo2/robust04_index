			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Geoffrey Crothall in Beijing, Willy Wo-Lap Lam] </F>   [Text] A group of dissidents in Shanghai has sent a  petition signed by 54 activists to the National People's  Congress, demanding a multi-party system, freedom of the press,  and independent unions. It was the fourth pro-democracy letter  sent to the Chinese authorities since the beginning of March  amid the most serious challenge to communist power since 1989.  State-security and police in Beijing, Shanghai, and other  cities have tightened surveillance on the campuses and  individual dissidents.    Speaking in Shanghai yesterday, Bao Ge, a veteran activist,  said the 19-point petition was sent last Friday to the reception  office of the Chinese parliament. Called "Blueprint for the  Political Democratisation of the State and Society in 1994" the  petition was signed by people "from all walks of life in  Shanghai intellectuals, academics, artists, peasants, workers  and private businessmen", Mr Bao said. The names include  prominent dissidents Yang Zhou, Wang Fucheng and Li Guotao, who  are members of the Chinese Human Rights Association, based in  Shanghai, he said.    The list of demands in the petition include adoption of a  law  on press freedom and on a multi-party system, the authority to  create independent unions, and abolition of the notion of  "counterrevolutionary crime" in the penal code. The petition  also demands an end to "re-education through work," imposed  without trial by the police.    It calls for a law to punish corruption and the opening of a  national inquiry into the chain of events leading to the June 4,  1989, Beijing massacre. "It is our first signature campaign and  we are going to extend the movement nationwide," Mr Bao said.  "Several influential personalities have announced they share  our point of view and are contemplating joining our movement,"  he said.    Mr Bao said the petition is "the continuation" of the "Peace  Charter" launched in mid-November in Beijing by several human  rights advocates. "But the charter has limits because it calls  for democratisation under the leadership of the Communist  Party," he said. "We think that without party leadership, we  can also reach democracy."    Activist Mr Yang said signatories had discussed the points  in  the petition "in private" and had refrained from holding  large-scale gatherings so as not to give police an excuse to  crack down. However, sources close to the security establishment  said both the Ministry of State Security and the Ministry of  Public Security had deployed extra staff to keep tabs on the  dissident community. They said at least one state security unit  had been stationed in every major college in Beijing and  Shanghai.    Security in Beijing successfully prevented the holding of a  gathering to mark the 15th anniversary of the arrest of Wei  Jingsheng, the country's most prominent dissident. Wei, who was  pressured into leaving Beijing on March 6, has not returned to  the capital and it is understood the authorities were determined  to keep him out of the way during the anniversary, which also  marks the last day of his parole.    A group had reportedly planned to hold a party in Wei's  honour yesterday but police got wind of the scheme and  intensified security in the capital accordingly. Former student  leader, Wang Dan, said a group of police officers had been  stationed outside his apartment building yesterday morning,  while other dissidents said they too were being watched more  closely than usual. The heightened surveillance of dissidents  is expected to continue over the next few months.</p>

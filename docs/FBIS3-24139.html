			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Candidate of Technical Sciences Boris Minin, </F> director of the Methodological Center of Systems of Quality  Certification of Goods and Services, under the rubric "Quality  Control": "Certification With No Tricks"]    [Text] The International Academy of Information  Services has established the Methodological Center of Systems of  Quality Certification of Goods and Services--the MTs SSK.  <H5>  Proceeding From the Standard </H5>   Certification is "the action of a third party which makes it  possible to establish the conformity of qualitative  characteristics, the quality of a given product or service, to  requirements established by a particular document." In civilized  countries networks of certification centers specializing in  various types of goods and services are quite common. They  provide clear-cut landmarks for the consumer in a crowded market  for products. For an honest manufacturer this is the best  opportunity for fair competition. Therefore, certification is a  mechanism for regulating market relations in a competitive  environment. On the contrary, in the absence of such mechanisms,  the unbridled and completely uncontrollable, semibarbaric market  cannot shape a civilized society in which the dignity of  citizens is among the principal values. At present, we are at  the very beginning of the path to this society.    Here is the essence of the procedure being introduced, for  those who have not managed to familiarize themselves with the  Law "On the Certification of Products and Services" (approved by  Decree of the Supreme Soviet No. 5153-1 of 10 June 1993), the  work that preceded it in the Russian Federation Committee on  Standardization, Metrology, and Certification, the All-Russian  Scientific Research Institute of Standardization, and other  institutes and establishments.    The legislation envisions certification of two types:  compulsory and voluntary. Compulsory certification takes into  account indicators concerning citizens' health, citizens'  property, and environmental protection. It goes without saying  that this type of certification is more than just necessary for  many goods and services! A state organ, the Russian Federation  Committee on Standardization, Metrology, and Certification, has  undertaken to manage the implementation of certification.    Any quality parameter may undergo so-called voluntary  certification. This procedure is effected on the initiative of  either the manufacturer or the consumer. Therefore, the  voluntary nature applies rather to the selection of parameters,  the form of certification, and so on. It may be foisted on many  producers contrary to their wishes.    In the simplest case, any producer (for example, a regular  barber shop) may, having taken the state standard, sectoral  standard, technical specifications, or even a list of  requirements from, say, the United States or Mongolia as a  basis, ask to be issued a certificate of compliance by the  quality of his services with requirements outlined in the above  regulatory documents. Undoubtedly, the multiplicity of such  evaluations will hardly accomplish anything for the consumer,  and it will play into the hands of those who will simply be able  to hustle quickly, allocating some hundreds of thousands of  easy-come rubles for certification. After all, millions are now  being wasted on absolutely uninformative advertisement. Any  producer may, at minimum cost, receive a "certificate of  compliance" with anything. The beautiful piece of paper will  hang in every business. Therefore, the consumer will once again  end up sadly ignorant of the genuine quality of the goods and  services offered to him.    However, there is another possibility: establish a uniform  base for comparisons for all, and issue certificates that  indicate the level of quality--the degree to which the quality  of the tested sample, merchandise, or service exceeds that of  the selected base. Therefore, a "Quality Certificate" is the  highest degree of certificate of compliance endowed with greater  rights.    It was precisely this path, the path of creating the optimal  system of quality certification, that we took in developing the  system of quality certification.  <H5>  Quality-Related Services </H5>   Work devoted to evaluating the quality of services, i.e. an  area that has until now been a "terra incognita" in a way, has  now been completed. Following prolonged debate, a generalized  nomenclature of quality parameters of services has been finally  specified and adopted, which has provided the foundation for  selecting a basis for comparison in the system of quality  certification of services developed by us.    Unlike the nomenclature of quality parameters of goods,  services have four strictly delineated groups: the quality of  the service proper, the standard of service, consumer spending  for access, and, as a rule, the indirect effect (or loss)  entailed by the principal effect.    With a view to establishing regional centers (in oblasts,  cities, republics...), a number of certification organs for  popular services--insurance, apartment exchanges, tourism,  repairs of radio and television equipment, and others--have to  be registered with the Methodological Center of the Systems of  Quality Certification of Goods and Services. Many such centers  are already working with specific enterprises, and the latter  will soon be able to receive the first quality certificates in  our country. Detailed information about this will be provided in  the mass media. Naturally, consumers will draw the appropriate  conclusions from this.    Contact telephone number 241-39-03.</p>

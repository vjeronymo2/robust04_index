			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Mitsubishi to import glass - Move to end Japanese market domination after US pressure MITSUBISHI Corporation, Japan's leading trading house, is to import foreign sheet glass in an attempt to break domestic manufacturers' domination of the market. The move is in response to the sharp appreciation of the yen and mounting calls from the US for Japan to increase glass imports. A favourable reaction from domestic wholesalers to trial imports from Pilkington Glass of the UK and Guardian Industries of the US has accelerated plans. The imports are expected to erode the market share of Asahi Glass, which belongs to the Mitsubishi keiretsu, or industrial grouping, Nippon Sheet Glass and Central Glass, which have dominated the country's construction and housebuilding glass market. Mitsubishi said the company's interests came before the keiretsu, reflecting an easing of corporate ties. Its decision was guided by Mr Makoto Kuroda, senior managing director and a former senior trade negotiator at the Ministry of Trade and Industry. The deal with Guardian was conducted through one of Mr Kuroda's former negotiating counterparts at the US trade representative's office, now working for the Tokyo arm of the US glass maker. Mitsubishi has ties with Yamada Shoten, a leading domestic glass wholesaler, and hopes to expand annual sales to Y1.5bn (Pounds 9.1m), or 0.5 per cent of market share, for the first year. A company spokesman said he expected imports to gain substantial market share in the future. Sumitomo Chemical and Nissan Chemical Industries of Japan are to form an agrochemical development and marketing joint venture with Rhone-Poulenc, France's largest chemicals company. The new company will have capital of FFr65m (Pounds 7.4m), with Sumitomo holding a 60 per cent stake, Nissan a 30 per cent stake, and Rhone-Poulenc 10 per cent.</p>

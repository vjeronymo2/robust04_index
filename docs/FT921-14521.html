			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Foreign Affairs: The arms bazaar fragments - Nuclear weapons know-how is leaking to developing countries - and the west is worried The idea that the break-up of the Soviet Union could be considered a threat to international security would have been laughed out of court not so many months ago. The collapse of the Soviet communist regime and the consequent abandonment of its menacing military posture could only enhance the prospects for world peace, it was generally believed. It has not taken very long for these illusions to be shattered. Though the US and its western allies are no longer faced by a monolithic enemy, they have to deal with a much more insidious danger: the possible dispersal of former Soviet nuclear weapons into much less secure and predictable hands. Ostensibly, the worst-case scenario - that of the fragmentation of the former Soviet Union's nuclear arsenal into several independent nuclear forces - appears to have been avoided, at least for the moment. At their meeting in Minsk last month, the members of the new Commonwealth of Independent States agreed that the ex-Soviet strategic nuclear forces would remain under a single command, thus meeting one of the west's main concerns. The man in charge will be the Russian president, Mr Boris Yeltsin, though the other states with nuclear weapons on their territory - Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus - will have to be consulted before they are employed. The decision by at least two of these republics to become non-nuclear states and to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) must be considered a bonus. The settlement of the quarrel between Russia and Ukraine over the control of the Black Sea fleet is a further step in the right direction, since all the ships capable of carrying nuclear weapons will remain under central command. Yet it is impossible to know at this stage whether these agreements will survive the severe strains that have arisen between Russia and its sister republics. Even on the most optimistic assumptions, the control and safety of nuclear weapons in the republics will remain a serious problem during a long transitional period. Though all the new republics, except Russia, have agreed to remove or destroy their nuclear weapons by the end of 1994, some experts believe that such a process could take as long as five to 10 years in practice. During this time, states which have neither the necessary expertise, facilities or experience, let alone the financial resources, will be responsible for the transport, storage, dismantlement and destruction of thousands of dangerous nuclear weapons. It is clear that they will not be able to carry out the provisions of the 1991 strategic arms reduction treaty (Start), which they have undertaken to respect, nor do so in safe and secure conditions, without massive aid from the west. Equally worrying, if not more so, is the likely impact of the break-up of the Soviet Union on the worldwide proliferation of nuclear weapons. Mr Dick Cheney, the US defence secretary, has just issued a stark warning that as many as eight or nine developing countries could possess nuclear weapons by the end of the century. There is already a lively market in Third World states for cut-price Soviet weaponry of all kinds. A Mig-29 aircraft is said to be going for the snip of Dollars 25m. What price an intercontinental ballistic missile? But what Mr Cheney and other western statesmen are really worried about is not so much the transfer of actual weapons as the leakage of nuclear know-how to developing countries seeking to acquire nuclear weapons. The new independent republics are as fertile a head-hunting ground for countries such as Libya, Iran and Pakistan as Germany was for the US after the Second World War. Tens of thousands of scientists have already lost, or are about to lose, their jobs as the result of the break-up of the Soviet Union and can probably be bought for much less than the German rocket expert Wernher von Braun in 1945. Restricting the membership of the 'nuclear club' has always been an uphill battle. The number of adherents to the 1968 NPT, who have undertaken not to acquire nuclear weapons or assist others in doing so, has been steadily rising since it came into force some 22 years ago and has now reached the impressive number of 144. But the figures are misleading. While it is true that no country has joined the official 'nuclear club' of the US, the former Soviet Union, Britain, France and China since 1964, undeclared members have been increasing slowly but steadily. The spread of nuclear weapons has transformed the regional security picture. In the Middle East, Iraq came Israel's presumed but unacknowledged possession of nuclear weapons, before it was comprehensively stopped in its tracks by the US-led military operation in the Gulf. In South Asia, both India and Pakistan have long been considered at least as threshold nuclear powers which, even if they did not already possess nuclear weapons, could quickly develop them. The same is true for North Korea, South Africa, Argentina and Brazil. According to one school of thought, the possession of nuclear weapons by rival regional states could lead to a stand-off between them and bring stability to traditionally unstable areas, such as the Middle East. The more widely-accepted view, however, is that greater proliferation of weapons will inevitably lead to a heightening of political and military tensions in the regions concerned. The openly expressed fear in some US quarters that Pakistan could produce an 'Islamic bomb', which could become the basis of a regional strategic bloc embracing Pakistan, Iran and the new Islamic republics of Central Asia, may not be all that far-fetched. These developments have been offset by some recent improvements in the proliferation picture. South Africa, after the solution of several southern African regional conflicts, signed the NPT and ratified its IAEA safeguards agreement last year. Brazil and Argentina have also signed a bilateral safeguards agreement which will be linked to the IAEA safeguards system. And within the last few days, North Korea has concluded an agreement with South Korea declaring the peninsula free of nuclear weapons and accepting international inspections. Nevertheless, the post-Gulf war discovery of the nuclear weapons development programme of an NPT member state, Iraq, has underlined the shortcomings of the treaty. The most urgent need is to strengthen the IAEA's safeguards regime to make sure that in future all nuclear facilities are declared by member states. That will require both a system of random or challenge inspections and the closer involvement of the UN Security Council in the non-proliferation regime, as it is already in the efforts to uncover Iraq's undeclared nuclear activities. At the same time, care must be taken that the strengthened safeguards system does not give the appearance of an instrument used by the industrialised world to restrict Third World development. If the NPT is to be extended in 1995 for at least another 25 years, the nuclear powers must make sure that they have fulfilled their part of the original bargain, linking non-proliferation efforts to real progress in nuclear arms control. Many developing countries will argue that the Start treaty does not go far enough. Their demand that further reductions of strategic weapons must be complemented by a comprehensive test ban treaty to halt the development of new nuclear weapons looks much more reasonable now than it did before the disintegration of the Soviet Union.</p>

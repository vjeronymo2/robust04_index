			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (20): Rough weather continues - Japan / The 'clear skies' forecast has proved to be optimistic JAPAN'S forecasters have taken to studying cloud formations to increase their understanding of the economy's poor health. The Economic Planning Agency said an unusually wet summer had led to 'unanticipated' falls in consumption, and the Bank of Japan has partly blamed the weather for driving away an expected recovery. The EPA presumes that a promised recovery is overdue, not that its original 'clear skies' forecast was overly optimistic, although the agency predicted 3.3 per cent growth for the fiscal year and most private institutional estimates are for 1 per cent or less growth. Causes - other than the meteorological - of the prolonged downturn are described in the EPA's own investigation into the 'bubble economy' of the late 1980s, when asset prices, capital investment and corporate profits reached unsustainable heights, from which they have descended for the past three years. In the report, the EPA conceded that the 1980s excesses had left a 'huge scar on the Japanese economy' and that recovery 'will likely remain more moderate than past recovery phases'. The EPA also suggested that the 'last adjustment phase' before recovery began in 1991, meaning that the economy has been 'bottoming out' for more than two years. Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's new prime minister, arrived in office to find his advisers at the EPA predicting an imminent recovery, while the flow of economic statistics headed in the opposite direction. New car sales in July fell 10.8 per cent from a year earlier, the ratio of job offers to applications slipped from 81:100 to 74:100 during June and the trade surplus in July expanded 24.9 per cent, as import demand remained weak. Mr Hosokawa's response was a Y6,150bn spending and deregulation package, also designed to pass on the benefits of yen appreciation to consumers. The yen's rise had put extra pressure on manufacturers still flabby after their investment excesses of the late 1980s. Instead of relocating more production in lower-cost east Asian countries, many manufacturers added capacity in high-cost Japan. The increase in capital spending in the late 1980s, when capital was raised at almost no cost, was highlighted by a 24.4 per cent rise in new machinery orders during 1988. Companies which put on extra production capacity and staff were, in some cases, also indulging in speculative property and stock investments which have since turned sour. These companies are now facing their fourth successive year of falling profits. The New Japan Securities Research Institute estimated in early September that the combined pre-tax profits of companies listed on the Tokyo exchange would fall 17 per cent in the year to March, while their sales would shrink 3 per cent. A senior manager at a Japanese brokerage said the Bank of Japan and the EPA had apparently failed to comprehend the eventual effects of the asset price fall on the 'real economy'. In the months after the stock price slide begin in 1990, bank officials argued that the effects would be isolated, afflicting only those companies and individuals speculating in property and stocks. As well as discovering that speculation was more prevalent than they had expected, Bank of Japan officials conceded that they had underestimated the effects on consumer and corporate confidence of the market crash. Two years ago, the bank insisted that companies were 'unnecessarily gloomy', but their profits have fallen a long way since then. The bank is concerned that the yen's appreciation has made companies even more gloomy, and capital spending will continue to fall. Mr Yoji Inaba, economic research director at the Japan Development Bank, said companies had generally presumed that the yen would strengthen, but the pace of appreciation has surprised them. He warned that the currency movements would encourage cost-conscious companies to lay-off staff on a scale not seen in modern Japan. 'Another year of falling profits and companies will have to start getting rid of excess workers in middle management,' he said. There are signs that labour cutbacks have already entered a new phase. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone wants to reduce its workforce by 10,000 in the next year through voluntary retirement and its longer-term goal is to trim employees from 230,000 to 200,000. Toshiba, the electronics group, followed the NTT announcement with a plan to shed 5,000 workers over the next three to five years. On the day Toshiba explained its cutbacks, the Machine Tool Builders' Association reported that machine tool orders fell 27 per cent in July, against a year earlier. The yen's appreciation, halted momentarily by concerted intervention, has stirred debate about a 'hollowing out' of Japanese industry, a theme popular during the bout of appreciation in the mid-1980s. The fear is that profit production capacity will be shifted to cheaper Asian locations, a point made by the Bank of Japan in its most recent quarterly outlook for the economy. 'The current stagnant investment in the assembly industry is a reflection of low profitability in the industry, and the possibility that a further appreciation of the yen could trigger a massive substitution of overseas investment for domestic production cannot be ruled out,' the bank said. The seven-party coalition is divided over how much time should be spent on economic policy, as its first priority is supposed to be reforming the political system. But the coming of coalition government has not been as disruptive as Japanese business organisations had feared. A consensus quickly emerged within the coalition that another stimulatory package was needed, and the Bank of Japan appeared to agree that lower official interest rates were also necessary to encourage investment and private consumption. Meanwhile, the finance ministry is delighted that Mr Hirohisa Fujii, the new finance minister and a former bureaucrat, has quickly fallen into policy line. Mr Fujii is already arguing that the country cannot afford a tax cut and that a spending package must be calculated with an eye on falling tax revenues.</p>

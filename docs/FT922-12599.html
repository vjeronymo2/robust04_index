			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Libyan flights blocked as UN sanctions begin LIBYA challenged the United Nations air embargo imposed yesterday by proceeding with scheduled flights to destinations in Europe and the Middle East - but its aircraft were turned back. At the same time the US, Japan and a number of European countries said they would expel Libyan diplomats in accordance with UN sanctions. In Tripoli, the Libyan news agency Jana said 'reciprocal measures' had begun against states imposing sanctions. It did not give details, but it is likely western diplomats in the Libyan capital will be sent home in retaliation. The sanctions, passed on March 31, follow Libya's refusal to hand over two men indicted in the west on suspicion of planting the bomb that destroyed Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie in 1988. Libya's neighbour, Egypt, became the first Arab country to enforce the air embargo when it informed Tripoli that Egyptian airspace was closed. A foreign ministry official in Cairo said Egypt 'respects international legality'. Libyan Arab Airlines flights were also turned back by Tunisia and Switzerland, which has implemented sanctions even though it is not a member of the UN. Two Italian air force jets were scrambled to deter a Libyan Boeing 727 from entering Italy's airspace. Japan's announcement that it would expel Libyan diplomats was followed by similar statements from the US, Sweden, Italy and France. A reduction in Libya's 16-member UN delegation in New York is to be announced soon. The US has no diplomatic links with Tripoli. However, the UK said that two Libyan envoys in Britain, working from the Saudi Arabian embassy, would remain in their posts - at least while two British diplomats still operated from the Italian embassy in Tripoli. UN Resolution 748 bans the international movement of Libyan Arab Airlines, bars the shipment of arms to Libya and requires a reduction in Libyan diplomatic representation. Under the sanctions, Libya is also required to turn over four men allegedly involved in the bombing of a UTA jet in 1989 over Niger, and to take concrete steps to disassociate itself from terrorism. Hours after sanctions came into effect the UN Security Council set up a committee to oversee implementation and deal with requests for exemptions. These are expected mainly to allow foreign workers to fly out of Libya. Resolution 748 empowers the sanctions committee to allow flights 'on grounds of significant humanitarian need'. The UK and US stressed that the sanctions resolution was mandatory. 'The Council means business,' warned Sir David Hannay, UK ambassador to the UN, noting that governments had until May 15 to report on measures taken to implement the embargo. Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, interviewed on BBC radio, said continued Libyan intransigence could prompt the US, Britain and France into considering an oil embargo against Tripoli. 'That's obviously something that could be considered for the future,' he said, though Foreign Office officials said such an embargo was not yet under discussion. The streets of the Libyan capital were reported to be calm but Libya's official media maintained a barrage of criticism against the west. Libyan Radio accused the US, Britain and France of 'renewing their colonial attempt' to bring down the regime. It accused the west of seeking to 'make up for the failure' of the US bombing raid six years ago, when the US targeted Colonel Muammer Gad-affi's headquarters in an apparent attempt to eliminate him.

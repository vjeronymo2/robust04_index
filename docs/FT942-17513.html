			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Books: Brittan stakes a claim on glory - Conservatives may not be too happy with this European manifesto THE EUROPE WE NEED by Sir Leon Brittan Hamish Hamilton, Pounds 17.99, 248 pages It may seem a rum idea, especially after the events of the past couple of weeks, that the European Union should choose a Brit as the next president of the European Commission. Yet Sir Leon Brittan, the former cabinet minister and a long-standing vice-president of the Commission, is strongly in the running for the post. This book is his manifesto. Not all members of the British Conservative Party will like it. Sir Leon is in favour of moving towards European monetary union as soon as possible. He believes that it will be hard to maintain the European single market without a single European currency. He defends the objectives of the common agricultural policy. And not only does he accept the Treaty of Maastricht pretty well en bloc; he thinks it should be built on. Whereas UK Prime Minister John Major once said that Britain should be at the heart of Europe, Sir Leon comes close to arguing that an enlarged European Union is Europe. He does not say, but clearly implies, that its development will continue with or without the full participation of the British. A natural Tory reaction to the book might be that Sir Leon has 'gone native', though in truth he was pretty native to start with. None of that, however, should prevent the British government from fully supporting his candidacy. It must be better for Britain to have someone they know and understand in a place that matters. Anyway, it is not primarily Westminster and Whitehall at which the book is aimed. The main target is Paris and some of the smaller European capitals. For there can be no question of the next president of the commission being a Frenchman since the outgoing president is Jacques Delors. Even the French would not expect to hold the post twice in a row. The Germans have seldom been seriously interested in putting up a candidate of their own, and the Italians have retreated into their internal affairs. So if the presidency is to go to a big country, Britain is in with a chance despite the fact that there was a British president - the now Lord Jenkins of Hillhead - from 1977-81. With French support and the sympathy of the smaller countries, Sir Leon could be there. On the evidence of The Europe We Need he would be the right man for the job. The 'we' in the title is left ambiguous. It could refer to Britain or to the Union as a whole. Sir Leon does not discriminate. As a lawyer by training, he realises the size of the task, which is no less than to continue to develop the constitution of an expanding united states of Europe. Those words are mine, not his, and the choice of small letters for united states is deliberate. Yet that is exactly what the book is about. Sir Leon goes through the whole range of policies. He wants free trade, deregulation and vastly reduced state subsidies, all of which we know. On a European defence policy, he prefers to go slowly and only on the basis of consensus - a line that should appeal to the French as well as the British. He would not over-hurry the entry of eastern European countries, but would help them on the way. The core of the book, however, concerns his views of the Union's institutions, in particular the Commission and the European Parliament. To outsiders, the Commission frequently appears an interfering bugbear. The normal inside view is that it is simply the Union's civil service, proposing policies to the Council of Ministers but not taking ultimate decisions, and not much bigger than some of the London borough councils. Sir Leon has a different emphasis. He writes that the Commission was 'conceived as more than a secretariat, but definitely less than a government'. Under the Delors presidency, he argues that it 'reclaimed its status as a political body'. He would like to move on from there and streamline the Commission's activities. Especially after the next enlargement, the Commission would take more of the form of a national government. There would be a greater hierarchy and an end to the horizontal structure where, in theory, all commissioners are equal. Instead there would be seniors and juniors. The big countries would always have a senior post; junior posts would rotate between all member states. Any potential loss of democratic control would be balanced by greater powers for the European Parliament and a new committee of parliament, made up of members of national parliaments and designed to oversee the work of the Commission and the Council of Ministers. There are many more proposals: for instance, for a three-tier voting system that would preserve the principle of unanimity on important questions. Yet it is on the parliamentary side that Sir Leon seems least sure of himself. A bold man would propose either to abolish the Parliament altogether, allowing scrutiny to lie with national parliaments, or to give it more direct power. This is at the heart of the British dilemma, particularly in the Tory Party. Westminster is jealous of the powers of the European Parliament: the MEPs have little access to Westminster, hence there is no co-ordination. One answer might be to restore the dual mandate, allowing British politicians to sit in both places. Until the dilemma is resolved, the British Parliament is likely to remain hostile to Brussels and Strasbourg. Sir Leon may not have all the answers, but as a lawyer he reads the texts and takes them seriously. The great British failing has been to ignore the texts - such as the Treaty of Rome - until it was too late to change them. This book should be read as a draft text on the future of the Union, for Sir Leon is in the mainstream of Europe.</p>

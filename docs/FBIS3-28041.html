Noting that Comrade Kim Il-song, the respected leader of the  Korean people, has put forward the greatest anthropocentric idea  that guarantees human emancipation and boundless happiness for  the people, he said this is no other than the great immortal  chuche idea.    "The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is further developing  and enriching the chuche idea," he said, and continued:    "The imperialists are most afraid of the truth that man is  master of everything and decides everything, because they  consider the popular masses their slaves and the target of  exploitation.    "The imperialists are now most afraid of Korean-style  socialism with the chuche idea as a guideline and the  singlehearted unity of Korea.    "Genuine popular politics cannot be administered where there  is no such a great anthropocentric idea as the chuche idea."  Pointing out that "the chuche idea brings eternal freedom and  happiness to the mankind, he stressed this is proved by the  realities of Korea."</p>

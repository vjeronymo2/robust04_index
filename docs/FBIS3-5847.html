			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with French Foreign Trade Minister </F> Gerard Longuet by NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN reporter Shota Kobayashi  in Paris on 8 March]    [Text] Paris, 8 Mar -- During the interview, Foreign Trade  Minister Longuet criticized the United States for having  reinstated the Super 301 provision of the Omnibus Trade and  Competitiveness Act (which identifies nations engaging in unfair  trade practices and imposes sanctions against them), saying:  "The nation has unilaterally brought the bilateral confrontation  into the present trade system." Longuet expressed deep concern  over the U.S. Government's intervention in private-sector trade.  Moreover, he stated that he would urge Japan to open markets in  the public works and high-technology fields during his visit to  Japan. With regard to voluntary export restraints on Japanese  cars to the European Union (EU), he mentioned his intention to  introduce regulations on the total number of Japanese cars,  including cars produced within the EU area.    Regarding the U.S. Government's reinstatement of the Super  301 provision, Longuet stressed: "It is a surprise to us to  learn that the United States made a one-sided decision, which  targets Japan, its largest trade partner, with the signing of  GATT's Uruguay Round agreement near at hand." He said: "Such a  method has already gone down in history." He then pointed out  that long-term multilateral negotiations through such  organizations as the World Trade Organization (WTO) are  important for the sake of maintaining the trade balance.    Citing the White House's announcement on the sale of private  U.S. airplanes to Saudi Arabia, Longuet expressed his  displeasure and said: "The United States has a strong tendency  to politically intervene in private-sector trade." He added:  "The country is trying to promote foreign trade while  disregarding market economy rules."    On economic relations with Japan, Longuet touched on the  fact  that France's trade deficit with Japan for 1993 decreased to 24  billion francs (a franc equals about 18 yen) from 30 billion  francs the previous year. He expressed dissatisfaction, saying:  "The main cause of the decrease is a drop in imports due to the  economic recession in France."    Longuet indicated that, to correct the trade imbalance, he  would continue to urge Japan to open markets in the service  fields, including high-technology products such as helicopters;  public works; and the agricultural products field.    He also stressed: "The main point at issue lies not in  individual sectors but in Japan's structural trade surplus."  Longuet expressed expectations for his visit to Japan, saying:  "I believe that as the Japanese-U.S. relationship is now facing  difficulty, this is a good opportunity for us to bring about a  better understanding of Japan's claims to the United States and  European nations."    With regard to Japan's voluntary restraint of exporting  automobiles to the EU, he pointed out: "The drop (in sales) of  Japanese cars was small in 1993 compared with the drop in sales  on the EU market as a whole." The minister stated that the  French Government would ask Japan to set a goal for voluntary  export restraints so that it can adjust the excess of exports  for 1993 during the following two years -- 1994 and 1995.    Exports of Japanese cars to the EU last year decreased by 20  percent from the previous year to reach 980,000 units, and the  decrease was larger than the drop in sales on the European  market (which registered a 16 percent decrease). For this  reason, it is believed that he made the remarks taking into  consideration the idea of introducing regulation on the total  amount which includes locally-produced automobiles.</p>

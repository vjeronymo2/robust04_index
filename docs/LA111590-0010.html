			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN RIGHT;  </P> <P> ASK CONGRESS FOR VITAL LEGITIMACY;  </P> <P> THE WAR OF NERVES WITH IRAQ SHOULD NOT BE UNDERCUT.  </P> <P> Three days after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, a senior White House official  sighed: "At least Congress is out of town." The President, crossing the White  House lawn from his helicopter, was asked by reporters how he planned to  respond. He snapped back, "Listen, watch and learn."  </P> <P> That has set the tone. It has been the President's business: personal and  private. But now that there soon may be 400,000 U.S. personnel in the Persian  Gulf region, it is time to involve 535 other Americans.  </P> <P> Perhaps Congress can clarify U.S. policy. Only Congress can legitimize  offensive action with forces this numerous.  </P> <P> It was nearly eight years after the first U.S. casualties in Vietnam before  U.S. forces there numbered 400,000. When Allied leaders met at Casablanca 13  months after Pearl Harbor, neither MacArthur in the Pacific nor Eisenhower in  Europe had more than 350,000 U.S. forces.  </P> <P> The problem today with Desert Shield is not that U.S. forces were deployed too  quickly, without congressional ratification. Halting Iraq required haste. But  the President simultaneously stipulated the purpose of the deployment to be not  mere containment but the unconditional withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait, and  restoration of Kuwait's regime, to be achieved by military force if economic  sanctions did not suffice.  </P> <P> The 1973 War Powers Act triggers congressional consultation and ratification or  termination of deployment initiated by presidents when U.S. forces are in  situations "where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by  the circumstances." Is this the case now, with U.S. officers telling the troops  to be prepared for an offensive soon?  </P> <P> The President characterizes the nearly doubling of the deployment as necessary  "to provide an adequate offensive military option" if economic sanctions fail  over an unspecified span. But a short span is implied by the decision  (simultaneous with the additional deployments) that troops will not be rotated  out of the desert until the basic mission is accomplished. This means that the  embargo is not to be given a chance to succeed.  </P> <P> The wrong worry today concerns "another Vietnam," meaning a large, protracted  conflict entered into by stealth and small increments, without congressional  involvement. Actually, Congress debated and funded Vietnam at every stage.  </P> <P> A more apposite and ominous analogy is to the outbreak of World War I, when  mobilization acquired a deadly momentum. France set in motion 3 million men on  4,278 trains, an intricate operation that, once begun, was almost impossible to  modulate. When the Kaiser wanted a pause in Germany's mobilization, he was told  it would be impossible to reroute 11,000 trains. Europe went to war because it  had started to go toward war.  </P> <P> Some people say that U.S. pronouncements and deployments that have already been  made mean the United States will be dangerously diminished and Saddam Hussein  dangerously enhanced if Desert Shield does not quickly achieve its objective.  If this is the President's thinking, then the United States is heading for war  because it has put in place the capacity for war.  </P> <P> When are Americans, who have listened and watched and not learned much in three  months, going to be told -- and sold -- clear objectives and a convincing  rationale?  </P> <P> The two undeclared wars since World War II were embittering. America entered  World War II in its third year after Japan attacked. We entered World War I  after direct attacks on our vital interests (freedom of the seas, the  Lusitania), and for a comprehensible, if extravagant, goal (to make the world  safe for democracy).  </P> <P> Are Americans now to fight for the vacuity of a "new international order"? Or  to make the Middle East safe for Kuwaiti feudalism? Even if punishing Iraqi  aggression is a vital U.S. interest, what justifies starting a clock for action  that precludes a full test of sanctions?  </P> <P> Must Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait be followed by a reduction of Iraq's  conventional, chemical, biological and potential nuclear capabilities? If, say,  Pakistan has both nuclear weapons and a dangerous leader, will we then be  bound, by the Iraqi precedent, to disarm Pakistan?  </P> <P> Some supporters of untrammeled presidential discretion want it used to bomb  Iraq just enough to degrade its power, but not enough to destabilize the  regional balance of power. Who has the skill to apply force in such precise  dosages?  </P> <P> The War Powers Act is of dubious constitutionality and cumbersome formality,  and the President's war of nerves with Iraq should not be undercut by a clock  controlling when Congress must ratify or reject Desert Shield.  </P> <P> But a comparable danger is a war begun with unclear goals and uncertain  domestic support. Congress should be convened to listen, watch, learn, clarify  and legitimize.  </P></p>

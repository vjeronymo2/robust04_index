			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Sport: Two billionaires and their wonder horse - Racing ALLEN Paulson is an aerospace magnate whose humble beginnings on an Iowa farm in Depression America have been translated into significant wealth. Sheikh Mohammed is one of the four Maktoum brothers who rule Dubai, the United Arab Emirates state which has been transformed in the last 30 years through oil. What both have in common, apart from wealth, is a passion for horseracing. Each owns half of Arazi, potentially the most exciting racehorse seen anywhere for 20 years or more. Arazi is a small three-year-colt who moves incredibly easily and has won all but the first of his nine races, eclipsing the best horses in Europe and the US. Today Arazis face his toughest test in America's most prestigious race, the Kentucky Derby, worth Dollars 985,000 (Pounds 556,000) to the winner and run over 1 1/4 miles on the dirt before 125,000 fans at Churchill Downs race course, Louisville, Kentucky. The French-trained colt is expected to win even though he faces up to 18 opponents. British bookmakers quote him the 4-7 favourite. Arazi would be the first European-trained horse to win the Kentucky Derby, run today for the 118th time. Not many have tried. The US media - 1,250 turf scribes have press accreditation at Churchill Downs - are staggered that a European horse, used to racing on grass and trained differently, is set to take their top race. Paulson, who bought Arazi for Dollars 350,000 as a foal, at the key Keeneland Sales in Lexington, Kentucky, and routinely has horses trained in France, insisted that the young horse fly to the US to challenge for the race he has always dreamt of winning. He got his way, in spite of selling a half share in Arazi for a reported Dollars 9m to Sheikh Mohammed, who, with his brothers, has built up the greatest racing and breeding empire ever seen. The sale was completed before Arazi made his first trip to Churchill Downs last November for the Dollars 1m Breeders' Cup Juvenile, in which he came from last to first with amazing ease, gaining a reputation as a wonder horse. If Arazi is successful today (the race starts at 10.32pm UK time), Paulson wants the colt, sired by Blushing Groom, to stay in America for the remaining Triple Crown races, the Preakness on May 16 and the Belmont on June 6. On the other hand, Sheikh Mohammed has not won an Epsom Derby, in spite of his enormous expenditure on thoroughbreds, and thinks Arazi should return to Europe to challenge for the world's most famous Flat race, on June 3. The man in the middle of this dispute is French trainer Francois Boutin, who insists on speaking his native language to the US press, although he has quite adequate English. He has the last say according to the contract between the two partners. Paulson, 70, and Sheikh Mohammed, 42, are very different sorts. The former is an entrepreneur who started out as a 30 cents-an-hour aircraft mechanic and became a pilot before making his first fortune in the aircraft spares market and going on to buy Gulfstream Aerospace, which makes luxury corporate jets, for Dollars 52m in 1978. Paulson turned Gulfstream round, took it public in 1983 and sold it to Chrysler for Dollars 636m in 1985. He remained chief executive and re-purchased the company when Chrysler ran into problems in 1990. Ironically, Chrysler sponsors the Dollars 5m Triple Crown Bonus for any horse that can win the Kentucky Derby, Preakness and Belmont in the same year. Paulson's philosophy is to work harder than rivals, take opportunities when he can and not dwell on mistakes. He is happy to be in the public eye. His partner in Arazi, Sheikh Mohammed, who is always surrounded by advisers and friends, shies from attention. They met at Keeneland Sales in the early 1980s when both vied to buy the best foals and yearlings on offer, happily spending millions of dollars. Paulson, who has splashed out about Dollars 150m on thoroughbreds and has 200 horses in training, says: 'The sales are a bit like going to Las Vegas. It's a gamble and it's exciting. I like the whole atmosphere and I also like to be there when my money is being spent. 'When I first got into the horse business in the 1960s, I didn't have the money to do it right. When we had some success at Gulfstream, however, I decided the time was right.' The Maktoum brothers have spent nearly Dollars 400m at Keeneland's main sale (in July) since 1980, also buying privately and at other sales worldwide. They buy both horses and aircraft from Paulson. Sheikh Mohammed, the third but dominant brother of Dubai's royal family, was educated largely in Britain and has never had money troubles. He has more horses in training worldwide - 608 - than anyone, and more than that again in his breeding operation, based mainly in Britain and Ireland. Because of the prize money structure, US owners have a chance of making racing pay, something which is almost impossible in Britain, where Sheikh Mohammed has most of his horses in training. Paulson regards racing as business-cum-enjoyable-hobby, whereas Sheik Mohammed, the defence minister of the UAE, prefers to see racing as a sport. The bloodstock market may have been in the doldrums for the last five years, but Sheik Mohammed's pursuit of excellence has not slackened. This is much to the relief of the Kentucky breeding industry, which has provided 89 of the 117 Kentucky Derby winners and was responsible for Arazi. Both Arazi's owners have established huge brood mare bands, and soon will be hoping to breed another Arazi. But horses like Arazi emerge once in 20 - perhaps once in 50 - years, as today's great Kentucky race is likely to confirm.</p>

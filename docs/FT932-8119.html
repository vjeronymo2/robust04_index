			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Letter: Limit to tax retaliation Sir, You report that the British government is expected to announce retaliation against US companies by cancelling their right to refunds of part of the tax credits attaching to dividends paid by UK subsidiaries ('UK poised to retaliate against California tax rules', May 13). It is worth noting, however, that the UK legislation only applies to those companies based in a state which operates a unitary taxation system or has companies in its group which operate from such states. Those US companies with UK subsidiaries which do not operate in unitary states such as California would not be affected by the proposed retaliation. John L. Wosner, managing partner, Pannell Kerr Foster, New Garden House, 78 Hatton Garden, London EC1</p>

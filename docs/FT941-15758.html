			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / UK Company News: UB takes a larger bite from its Finnish biscuit - A Nordic expansion United Biscuits, Britain's largest biscuits and snacks manufacturer, is strengthening its position in the Nordic market by buying a further 21 per cent of Fazer Biscuits, Finland's leading biscuit company, from the Fazer confectionery group. The move lifts UB's holding in the Finnish company to 70 per cent and follows its purchase of a 49 per cent stake in April 1991. Acquisition terms are not being disclosed. 'This move to majority control will enable us to drive forward our Nordic strategy with even closer integration of our Nordic operations and co-operation with the rest of our European biscuit network,' said Mr Hartwig Conzelmann, managing director of McVitie's, UB's biscuits division. The latest move crowns a hectic three-year expansion period for McVitie's, during which its share of the Nordic biscuit market has risen from 10 per cent to 47 per cent and annual sales have grown tenfold to Pounds 100m. The expansion, achieved through acquisitions and organic growth, has been designed to boost the company's market share and increase overall biscuit consumption in the region. It is also part of UB's wider thrust to strengthen its position in continental Europe and is in line with its strategy of obtaining leading positions in the markets where it operates. It also has a dominant market presence in the Netherlands through Verkade and in Hungary through Gyori Keksz. McVitie's purchase of the initial 49 per cent stake in Fazer Biscuits has proved successful. Sales at the Finnish company have increased by nearly 50 per cent since 1990 to exceed FM320m (Pounds 37m) last year and pre-tax profits have risen nearly five-fold. Apart from this latest purchase, UB has also gained full control of Oxford Biscuits, Denmark's leading biscuit group, and bought 90 per cent of Jyvas Hyva, Finland's second largest biscuit group. The expansion has cost less than Pounds 50m. The acquisitions have brought the company a range of new products and enabled it to build up the position of its own brands by using the local companies' distribution networks. McVitie's Digestive and Hob Nobs, exported from the UK, are now the top two brands in the Nordic region. The purchases have also meant that UB has been able to use its Nordic production facilities to feed into its own network. For example, the Finnish-produced Riva chocolate biscuit was successfully launched in the UK last year. McVitie's market share amounts to 70 per cent in Denmark, 65 per cent in Finland, 28 per cent in Sweden and 21 per cent in Norway. This makes it the region's leading biscuit supplier, ahead of the Norwegian group Orkla, which has 36 per cent of the market. The group is confident of further sales and profits growth, partly based on the potential for increasing biscuit consumption in the Nordic region. 'Per capita biscuit consumption in the Nordic region is between 2kgs-3kgs a year, compared to 14kgs-15kgs a year in the UK and 8kgs-10kgs in Germany and France,' said Mr Orla Topholt Pedersen, managing director of McVitie's, Nordic region. He said Nordic biscuit consumption had grown by an annual 5 per cent over the last three years, despite recession in the region, compared with a static trend during the late 1980s.</p>

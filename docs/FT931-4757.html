			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Danish premier sees Yes for Maastricht MR POUL Nyrup Rasmussen, Danish prime minister, said last night he was 'quite optimistic' Danish voters would say Yes to the Maastricht treaty in the country's referendum on May 18. 'Things are moving in the right direction,' Mr Rasmussen said after meeting Mr John Major, UK prime minister, at 10 Downing Street. Mr Rasmussen, the current European Community president, said he could not exclude that Maastricht ratification would be held up further by Monday night's House of Commons vote. But he added: 'I look forward to ratification of the treaty from the UK side, in the interest of Denmark and the rest of Europe.' The new Danish referendum is made necessary by the country's No to the treaty last June, which triggered a deal at the EC summit in Edinburgh in December to make the Maastricht process palatable to the Danish people. Mr Rasmussen, who took office in January, denied that the four crucial exemptions from the treaty won by Denmark at Edinburgh now made the treaty a charade. 'It's all about creating a more stable Europe. 'In some aspects, we say Denmark will not be there,' he added, referring to the opt-outs, above all in the areas of monetary union and defence. 'This is a positive basis for taking decisions on May 18.' Backing up Mr Rasmussen's optimism, an opinion poll in Copenhagen yesterday indicated 54 per cent of the electorate intended to vote Yes in the referendum, with only 25 per cent planning to say No. Mr Rasmussen said Denmark was determined to stand up to currency speculators, in spite of its decision not to take part in the final stage of economic and monetary union. One of the reasons why Denmark withstood pressure for a devaluation of the krone during the currency turbulence which occurred at the new year was strengthened co-operation within the European monetary system.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] General Juan Evaristo Gonzalez Maldonado, the  Military Supreme Court president, has noted that there are  newspapers, groups, and people who unceasingly and "viciously"  attack the Armed Forces.    Gonzalez said that the tasks carried out by the Armed Forces  are not fully understood, "perhaps because of ignorance, or  maybe through malice."    During the main ceremony to mark Military Courts Day,  Gonzalez stressed: "The task carried out by the Armed Forces is  not always fully understood, perhaps because of ignorance, or  maybe through malice. Therefore, some people, groups, and  newspapers are unceasingly attacking--more than often  viciously--the Armed Forces."    In his speech the general reproached critics of the Armed  Forces for not admitting or remembering that the Armed Forces,  like the entire country, are evolving "due to the political,  economic, and social transition."    In another passage of his speech, Gen. Juan Evaristo  Gonzalez  Maldonado emphasized that the military echelons, "subordinated  to the established power through the chain of command,  consciously and effectively observe allegiance to their  commander in chief and president of the Republic, engineer Juan  Carlos Wasmosy."  <H5>  Incorruptible Guardians </H5>   Gonzalez noted that the Armed Forces "are incorruptible  guardians of our fatherland's most precious assets, that is, its  sovereignty, its border security, and above all its unrestricted  fulfillment of the constitutional provision that guarantees to  all citizens freedom, democracy, and the normal development of  the established institutions."    The general also reported on the establishment and  development of military courts in our country.    Gonzalez also emphasized that the Military Supreme Court  fulfills a specific duty aimed at safeguarding the military  coexistence codes.    In this regard Gonzalez explained that there is a special  commission involved in preparing bills to adjust the Military  Supreme Court's activities to constitutional provisions.</p>

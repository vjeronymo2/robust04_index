			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kigali, 23 Feb (AFP) -- Tribal clashes broke out  sporadically here overnight as preparations went ahead for the  swearing-in of parliament and a transitional government  containing former rebels of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF).  Witnesses said they heard gunfire, and that RPF soldiers, who  are predominantly Tutsi, were fighting residents of the majority  Hutu tribe in Kigali.    A spokesman for the UN Assistance Mission for Rwanda said  however that its troops always accompanied RPF men, and he could  not confirm that former rebels were involved in armed incidents.  Humanitarian agency sources said there had probably been  casualties in what they described as "very localised" clashes,  but most of the capital was calm, they added. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Franco-German alliance is still Europe's motor - British problems will not kill Maastricht or the ERM THE European currency crisis inevitably raises a big question mark over the future prospects of the European Monetary System (EMS). When two of the participants are abruptly forced out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism, in a free float which their governments desperately wanted to avoid, and a third is forced to devalue as a by-product, it is obvious that there was something deeply wrong with the way the system was functioning, and quite likely with the system itself. But to go on to argue, as some commentators have done - that floating sterling automatically spells the end of the ERM, consigns to oblivion all plans for economic and monetary union in Europe, and renders wholly superfluous the French referendum on Sunday on the Maastricht treaty - that seems a leap too far. Above all, it is characteristically and damagingly anglocentric. Take the Maastricht referendum first. This week's currency storm may well have repercussions on Sunday's vote, but it would take a wise man to predict with any confidence whether these would be more likely to strengthen the Yes or the No tendency. The anti-Maastricht camp may claim that the crisis shows you cannot believe the British or trust the Germans; but the pro-Maastricht lobby will surely claim that France has been largely protected from the storm precisely because it has stuck close to Germany, with a hard-franc policy whose credibility is based on many years of a consistent Eurocentric economic policy. How the voters will react to these contradictory arguments must be a matter of pure speculation. The No vote may well be fuelled by the belief that the policy of European economic convergence is responsible for low growth and high unemployment. It is not immediately obvious, however, why French voters should take this latest episode in the long-running bankruptcy of British economic and monetary policy as an additional reason for rejecting the Maastricht treaty. On the contrary, they might conclude that the Exchange Rate Mechanism is a reassuring port in the storm, and that the case for Emu remains exactly where it was before, as argued in the Delors Report: the opening of a single European market, with free movement of goods and capital, and linked exchange rates, requires much greater economic co-ordination and probably a single monetary policy. There is just one proviso: the treaty recognises that some European economies might not be in any shape to accept the corresponding disciplines, and makes explicit provision for the possibility of a two-speed monetary union. This week's currency crisis has just proved the hypothesis in spades. But Germany, France and the Benelux countries may well be able to sustain the central core of the ERM, and there is nothing in the sterling crisis this week to prove that they could not take a new step forward towards monetary union later this decade. Most extraordinary among the aspects of the British government's performance this week was its attempt on Wednesday night to have the entire ERM system suspended until after the French referendum. The most probable consequence of a temporary suspension of the ERM is that it would prove permanent, and there would be no ERM to return to. The more fundamental point is that Maastricht is an essentially political treaty, the culmination of a shared strategy of European integration, developed by the founding members of the Community over the past 40 years. The motor of that strategy is the political alliance of France and Germany, which has consistently led the way for the development of the Community, buttressed by their association with Italy and the Benelux countries. It is hard to predict in detail just how these core countries will attempt a rescue if the French electorate turns against the treaty on Sunday; it is difficult to see how the Community will keep the treaty on the rails even if the result is Yes. But, among all the options available, the one which seems most unlikely is that France should abandon its strategy of a tight alliance with Germany. Conversely, it is almost as unlikely that Germany should abandon its strategy of a tight alliance with France. The Germans have some temptation to turn inwards, to their unification problems, and some temptation to assert a bigger international role for Germany, as at the UN. But, at the end of the day, the Germans and the French are almost certain to revert to their joint alliance as their top foreign policy priority. The Germans have no alternative that looks equally plausible in the medium term; the French have no alternative at all. This week's British proposal for a suspension of the ERM was a transparent attempt to prevent the appearance of too obvious a two-speed Europe, with Britain (and Italy) consigned to the slower track. The hard political fact is that there has always been a two-speed Europe, and Britain has always been on the slower track because that is the European speed it has preferred. Prime Minister John Major has repeatedly said his aim was to put Britain at the heart of Europe, and he continues to repeat his commitment to the principle of the ERM. But the heart of Europe is defined by the relationship of France and Germany, and it is their relationship which will determine the future of the Community.</p>

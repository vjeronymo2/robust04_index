			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD  </P> <P> Rogie Vachon always is on the hot seat at the Forum -- a seat in the press  section on the aisle, where the Kings' general manager is subject to  up-close-and-personal criticism from fans. . . .  </P> <P> But the past week has been a pleasure. The same fans who needled him for  sending  </P> <P> Bernie Nicholls to the  </P> <P> Rangers now are praising him for getting Tomas Sandstrom and Tony Granato. Just  shows you what a couple of playoff victories over the defending Stanley Cup  champions will do. . . .  </P> <P> Granato scored the winning goal in overtime Sunday against Calgary, and he and  Sandstrom produced two-thirds of the Kings' hat-trick hat trick  </P> <P> Tuesday night, but Vachon prefers to talk about their defense. . . .  </P> <P> "We're playing much tighter on the defensive end," Rogie said. "We've got the  same goaltenders and the same defensemen, except for the kid (Rob) Blake, that  we've had most of the season. So what's the difference? The forwards are doing  their job." . . .  </P> <P> Nicholls always was a goal scorer but never a disciplined two-way player. . . .  </P> <P> Wayne Gretzky, on how he felt last year after the Kings fell behind, 3-1, in a  </P> <P> Smythe Division semifinal series before eliminating Edmonton: "I was glad to be  coming home. We were trying to regroup and take one  </P> <P> step at a time. We had  </P> <P> just lost a tough game (4-3). Of course, this is a little  </P> <P> different situation for Calgary." . . .  </P> <P> Vachon, on the Flames: "The pressure is on them. It has been from day one.  They're expected to win." . . .  </P> <P> If the Kings complete the upset, the goaltending of Kelly Hrudey early in Game  1 should not be forgotten. They could have been blown out but fell behind by  only two goals before mounting their comeback. . . .  </P> <P> John Tonelli, on the Forum home-ice advantage: "Just listen to our crowds.  They're sensational." . . .  </P> <P> It has been a particularly embarrassing series for Calgary Coach Terry Crisp,  who was caught on TV in Game 3 using his necktie as a handkerchief. . . .  </P> <P> Marlon Starling's adviser, Mort Sharnik, doesn't think the commotion caused by  Michael Nunn's split with Ten Goose Boxing will affect the International Boxing  Federation middleweight champion in his title defense against Starling Saturday  at the Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas. . . .  </P> <P> "The ring is a safe harbor for a guy who has been fighting since he was 12 or  13 years old," Sharnik says. . . .  </P> <P> All the physical advantages belong to Nunn, who is taller, heavier, quicker and  younger than Starling. It wouldn't please the crowd, but  </P> <P> Nunn could probably win  </P> <P> a decision simply by sticking and moving. Starling, who is stepping up from the  welterweight division, must stay inside and work the body. . . .  </P> <P> Announced opponents for George Foreman continue to read like a virtual "Who's  that?" of boxing. The latest is Mike Jameson. . . .  </P> <P> Look-alikes: Fred Roggin and Rick Pitino. . . .  </P> <P> Didn't the Dallas Cowboys show the Atlanta Falcons,  </P> <P> who have Chris Miller and  </P> <P> are talking about drafting  </P> <P> Jeff George, the pitfalls of having two young quarterbacks? . . .  </P> <P> The seven-year-old Southern California Basketball Classic is moving to the  Forum Friday afternoon. The Southern Section All-Stars will play the City  All-Stars -- girls at noon and boys at 2 p.m. The featured performer is Lisa  Leslie, the prolific scorer from Morningside High School who has narrowed her  college choices to USC, Nevada Las Vegas and Cal State Long Beach. . . .  </P> <P> Jerry Buss is making the Forum available rent-free and hopes eventually to turn  the event into a Dapper Dan Classic of the West. . . .  </P> <P> Charles Barkley has become the favorite to be the NBA's most valuable player. .  . .  </P> <P> Don Johnson, the actor, will attempt to regain his title in the superboat class  of the powerboat racing championships Saturday off Long Beach. His boat, Team  USA, has 3,200 horsepower and is valued at $1.2 million. . . .  </P> <P> Vanity Texas license plate of Olympic Games silver medalist shotputter Randy  Barnes: "80 Feet." . . .  </P> <P> Flo Jo and Al Joyner are expecting. . . .  </P> <P> I hope Dale Murphy, the nicest guy in sports, regains his MVP form. . . .  </P> <P> One way to speed up major league games would be not to allow batters to call  time out except for unusual circumstances. . . .  </P> <P> The hottest player in baseball to have been named later is Tim Belcher,  </P> <P> who was named Sept. 3, 1987, to complete the deal that  </P> <P> sent Rick Honeycutt from the Dodgers to the Oakland Athletics five days  </P> <P> before.  </P></p>

			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / The Markets: Hidden casualties of the curve - Global Investor Within days, companies will begin to shower Wall Street with figures on their second quarter trading. The results season will help answer some of the questions currently troubling world markets, notably the impact of rising commodity prices on profit margins. It will also shed light on a point which has attracted less attention: the damage inflicted on corporate earnings by the shift in the yield curve. It is no secret that corporate treasurers have been playing in the interest rate swaps markets along with the hedge funds and the proprietary trading desks of banks. The Dollars 102m losses on swaps contracts revealed in the first quarter results of Procter &amp; Gamble, the US consumer goods group, showed that the hedges were not alone in their exposure to this year's interest rate hikes. But despite those examples, Wall Street may not fully have taken on board the implications of rising interest rates for corporate earnings. In the past three years, corporate treasurers have enthusiastically taken advantage of the steepness of the yield curve to cut the cost of borrowing. Through interest rate swaps, they have replaced expensive fixed rate long-term debt with much cheaper short-term floating rate debt. Some, at least, seem to have believed that monetary policy would not allow interest rates to rise to the extent implied by the curve - as P&amp;G's losses indicated. To a large extent, P&amp;G is a special case: the two deals in question were complex, highly leveraged swaps, multiplying many times the effect of rises in US and German interest rates. But if a new report by Salomon Brothers is correct, many companies employing more straightforward swaps will also have been squeezed, although to a lesser extent. Salomon estimates that over the past three years, industrial companies have swapped between 10 per cent and 20 per cent of their fixed-rate investment-grade debt into floating rate debt. Corporate treasurers, striking that kind of contract last autumn, would have expected to cut annual interest charges by 150 basis points. However the movement in interest rates since then has entirely wiped out the expected savings. If rates rise further, companies could be forced to pay more in interest than they would have on their original long term bonds. One response to this argument is that it understates the degree to which companies have taken steps to limit their exposure. It would also be easy, given the P&amp;G spectacle, to overstate the effect. But if right, the calculations imply that earnings expectations for the second half of this year and for 1995 are too high. Salomon attributes more than a quarter of the improvement in profits of the S&amp;P industrial sector between 1991 and 1993 to the falling cost of borrowing. If mainstream corporate America is now as exposed to rising interest rates as Salomon argues, then the much vaunted-recovery in corporate fortunes could be more easily undermined than much of Wall Street has assumed. Swedish bonds Late last week the bravest investors began to creep back to the Swedish markets, pointing to the success of the SKr6.5bn government bond issue amid the turbulence. Mr Atle Bekken at Enskilda Corporate, a leading broker in Swedish markets, even suggested that the rest of July would treat the markets well. It is far from clear, though, that confidence is well-founded. The bond issue was helped by high yields, the 7-year bonds offering 10.51 per cent and the 15-year offering 11.05 per cent. Moreover the fundamentals remain unchanged. The points to which Skandia, the insurance giant objected last week, in announcing that it would not participate in government bond auctions, justify alarm. Sweden has the fastest growing debt among Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development members, at 80 per cent of gross national product at the end of 1993. The budget deficit, which reached 13 per cent of GNP last year, may fall slightly this year. But taxes can scarcely rise further, and public spending cuts are politically inaccessible with the general election fast approaching. That is not to say that the fragility of the krona and of Swedish bonds offer speculators a one-way bet. The government is capable of making such a gamble expensive and it is conceivable that an incoming government would make slashing public spending its priority. But it would be astounding if many do not take the opposite view. You do not need to invoke the spectre of the tattered hedge funds, which have only partly repaired their resources after this spring's trauma in the bond markets, to expect further pressure. Polish strikes The threat of an outbreak of Polish strikes in support of higher wage claims has understandably rattled foreign investors. The four-week strike at the Warsaw steelworks owned by Lucchini, the Italian steelmaker, has been followed by threats of action at Fiat Auto in southern Poland. The Solidarity union in Warsaw has also threatened a boycott of Italian goods. But it would be too gloomy to suggest, as some have, that this could stall the inflow of capital underpinning the Polish transformation. They have come from workforces which stand a good chance of reaching Western European productivity levels, producing western-standard goods. The demands were also inevitable. Wages in a country on the German borders were not going to stay at one eighth of western European levels for long. The expression of union muscle represents a return of workers' confidence, but it need not undermine that future. It does, though, mean the end of the bargains.  ------------------------------------------------ S&amp;P 500 EARNINGS FORECAST  ------------------------------------------------                              1993    1994    1995 Est EPS (Dollars)            27.2    31.3    36.8 P/e ratio                    16.4    14.2    12.1 Est. % growth                16.5    15.4    17.5 No. of comps*                 500     500     494 % change EPS since 5/31/94      -    -0.5    -0.4  ------------------------------------------------ * Number of companies in the index for which data are available in IBES for each fiscal period.

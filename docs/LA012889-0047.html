			<p><P> January 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMNIST'S VIEWPOINT IS WAY OFF THE MARK  </P> <P> I'm no John Thompson fan. He has consistently refused to discipline or bench  his players for instigating fights.  </P> <P> But his principled stand, boldly demonstrated, on Proposal 42 is an entirely  different matter.  </P> <P> The protective, nurturing environment of an athletic dormitory, a demanding  coach and a change in environment can mean the difference in a young athlete's  life.  </P> <P> To bar a skilled athlete from a scholarship and force the athlete to navigate  the junior college system, or find means to pay for his/her education to  improve scholastically is to drastically diminish the athlete's chance for  improvement.  </P> <P> JIM CLENDENEN  </P> <P> Los Olivos  </P></p>

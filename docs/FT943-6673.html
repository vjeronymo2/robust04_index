			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading The release of revised second quarter US GDP data boosted derivatives, sending stock index futures sharply forward to trade at a healthy premium. At the close, the September contract on the FT-SE 100 stood at 3,287, up 44 on its previous close and about 19 points above its fair value premium to cash of about 6 points. Volume was 13,332 contracts. Turnover in traded options failed to match Thursday's high figure and closed at 34,796 lots. The stock options were particularly busy with Guinness, and NatWest trading over 3,000 contracts each.</p>

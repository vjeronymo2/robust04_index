			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ACCELERATED EMOTIONS IN THE ERA OF AIDS;  </P> <P> AFTERLIFE BY PAUL MONETTE (CROWN: $18.95; 288 PP.; 0-517-57339-3)  </P> <P> Steven Shaw, who owns a travel agency; Dell Espinoza, who has a landscaping  business, and Sonny Cevathas, a hustler with New Age leanings, all are likely  to die of the same disease they have just seen take the lives of their lovers.  </P> <P> "Afterlife" by Paul Monette, who wrote the memoir "Borrowed Time" about the  death of his own lover, is an affecting novel of gay mid-life in the epoch of  AIDS. Monette's prose has an engrossing, loose fluency as he tracks his three  AIDS "widowers," each trying to come to terms with his loss and get on with  what life is left to him. The three frequently converge at Steven's house in  the Hollywood Hills along with flames and female friends and co-workers for the  support they aren't likely to find in their actual families.  </P> <P> The central figure is Steven, who has gained 30 pounds since the death of his  lover, Victor, and no longer is interested in sex. Although he is a pivotal  figure in the book's plot, Dell, a Mexican immigrant outraged by a local  televangelist on a vendetta against gays, is sketched only with the broadest  strokes. Sonny, too, barely comes to life, a narcissistic cartoon. Monette  wisely spends most of his time on Steven, a character whose generous sympathy  for the others never obscures his own aches and foibles.  </P> <P> Slowly coming back to life, Steven discovers himself drawn to Mark Inman, a  former TV star who now is the personal manager of Lou Ciotta, a macho coke  freak who rules the Wednesday night TV lineup the way Cosby rules Thursday.  Inman lives a double life: nominally straight in his official persona,  escorting starlets to the Emmy Awards; promiscuously gay and uncommitted in his  off-hours. Then he discovers he too has AIDS, and when his boss rattles  impatiently, awaiting a million-dollar check to buy a racehorse on a whim,  Inman insults him and walks off his job.  </P> <P> Reconsidering his position, he brings Steven along on a rapprochement visit to  the palatial Hollywood estate of the Ciottas. In a wonderful scene, the TV  star's street-smart wife, Angela, takes Steven for a tour of the house while  her husband and his erstwhile manager confer. Lou has tried to be cool about  Mark's sudden coming out, but Angela, who has disrobed in her enormous walk-in  closet so she can try out her evening dress on Steven, seems genuinely at ease.  </P> <P> " 'You're so good for Mark,' she said with vivid good cheer. 'I never seen him  so relaxed.'  </P> <P> " 'Really, it's not what you think. We're more like . . . brothers or  something.'  </P> <P> "She faced him again, naked except for the black panties. 'Don't tell me about  love,' she offered. 'I'm Italian. It's the national sport.'  </P> <P> " 'Oh, I love him all right. Whatever that means.' Steven tried to sound breezy  -- tried too hard. 'But gay men are very weird about sex. They can't do it with  people they like.' "  </P> <P> The issue here, in essence the fear of intimacy, isn't unfamiliar to the terms  of straight relationships, and it's one measure of "Afterlife" that its story  -- aside from the particulars of erotic play, about which Monette is helpfully  both specific and more or less routine -- has so broad a resonance.  </P> <P> In perhaps the book's most telling and moving scene, Mark, knowing his days are  numbered but showing no external signs yet, visits his father, a jaunty widower  named Rob, in his Florida condo in a retirement complex, and lets go with his  double-whammy: He's gay, and he's tested positive for the AIDS virus. The old  man, who has fallen in love again with a nice lady named Roz, bears the news  with surprising grace, and then asks Mark about his new friend.  </P> <P> " 'It won't work, Dad. I'm not attracted to him.'  </P> <P> "Rob made an impatient waving motion, determined not to let the kid off the  hook. 'How old is he? He's your age?' Mark nodded curtly. 'Good, good,' said  Rob, as if the numbers were very important here. 'And he's got this virus too?'  </P> <P> " 'Uh-huh. He buried his lover last year.'  </P> <P> " 'Well, then, he knows,' retorted the father, his ruddy face beaming with  satisfaction.  </P> <P> " 'Knows what?' Mark bit the question off, not quite sure what he was angry at.  </P> <P> " 'That's all there is, son. Someone to love. You ask anybody here.' And he  gestured grandly out over the Pitch'n'Putt, but also included the mid-rise  condos banked on every side, full of seniors in lonely efficiencies. 'They've  either been married forty years, and they're holding on to what little time  they got left, or they're widowed and only half-alive. The lucky ones are like  Roz and me, we get another chance. We know it's not for long. Two years, three  years -- just like you say. But it's all there is, so you'll take even a  little.' "  </P> <P> AIDS paradoxically has telescoped the generations: The old widower is quite  sure that the information he's passing along to his son already is known by his  son's friend Steven, a young widower.  </P> <P> Knowing they have the virus that has claimed the lives of their lovers, the  protagonists of "Afterlife" move variously toward some kind of absolute value.  Sonny takes his cues from a New Age guru whom Angela recommends. Dell becomes a  gay radical urban guerrilla. And Steven claims with Mark the victory of letting  their seasoned, humane awareness of one another lead them all the way into  love.  </P> <P> Their lessons in life accelerated, just as their mortal cycle has been  shortened by this new Black Plague, they are able to achieve the only real  happy ending around. Their story makes "Afterlife" a radiant book.  </P></p>

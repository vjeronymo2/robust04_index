			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Arts: Cotman's genius brought into the light - Susan Moore reviews 'Cotmania and Mr Kitson' in Leeds It is the fate of the watercolourist to be consigned to art history's bottom drawer. If John Sell Cotman's chosen medium had been oil paint, he would be celebrated as one of the greatest and most original of British landscape painters. Instead, the vulnerability of watercolour to light has ensured that his work is secreted away in the darkness of museum print rooms, well out of the public eye. A rare opportunity to see something of his genius is offered by Leeds City Art Gallery. To mark the 150th anniversary of his death, the gallery is bringing to light a representative selection of some 40 watercolours and sketches drawn largely from its own rich holdings. Sydney Decimus Kitson (1871-1937), a Leeds-born architect, Cotman biographer and passionate collector, instructed that the bulk of his immense collection of over 1,000 watercolours, sketches and prints by and after Cotman, books, catalogues and articles relating to the artist and 12 commonplace books of 'Cotmania', should rest in his native city. Cotmania &amp; Mr Kitson is as much a tribute to this great champion of Cotman as to the artist himself. Appropriately, Cotman produced some of his most outstanding and innovative work in Yorkshire. His Yorkshire haven was at Brandsby with the Cholmeley family. Brandsby was the scene of the happiest hours in what proved to be a life plagued by ill-health, depression and disappointment. It had been the young Harriet Cholmeley who coined the term 'Cotmania' in a poem of 1803, sent to 'dear Cotty'. 'Near Brandsby' offers a taste of what is to come. The subject of the sketch is straightforward enough: a clump of slender trees beside a field gate. What is daring is Cotman's bold simplification of form, and a palette restricted to a close tonal harmony of grey, olive-green and buff with foliage and shrubs translated into blocks of flat, muted colour. The interplay of dark tones silhouetted against light brings depth and life to the landscape. The same earth colours and compositional devices are found in the panorama of Barnard Castle from Towler Hill, and Bignall Banks on the Greta. Leeds has the pencil sketch as well as the watercolour of the latter, and the two sheets reveal Cotman's relative faithfulness to 'that fickle Dame' Nature. For the finished watercolour the artist has reduced the detail and heightened the drama - adding the three birds flying across the dark foliage of what has become a ravine in the foreground, and emphasising the angularity of the clouds and streaming sunlight. Moving out of the first decade of the 19th century and on to studies of Norfolk and Normandy, one laments Cotman's decision to pursue antiquarian and topographical publishing projects, and to expand his teaching practice, at the expense of his art. There is nothing here to compare with the great Greta, Duncombe Park and Brandsby watercolours, although the monochrome studies of Blakeney and the bold geometries of the Domfront crags are undeniably impressive. The Greta watercolours had not been well received at the 1806 Royal Academy, and few were sold during his lifetime. Cotman was to die in penury and close to despair, his work having made little or no impact on his contemporaries. As Kitson bleakly commented, there was so little demand for Cotman's watercolours that no one bothered faking them. Nearby Temple Newsam House presents its fourth exhibition devoted to neglected aspects of historic interiors. 'Country House Lighting 1660-1890' and its accompanying catalogue offer a fascinating blend of social and design history in a stately progress through every kind of fitting - whether for candles, oil, gas or electricity, grand or humble - evolved in man's quest for effective artificial light. Until January 10, and at Brighton Art Gallery, January 30-March 14. 'Cotmania &amp; Mr Kitson', sponsored by Watmoughs (Holdings) and Christie's, continues at Leeds City Art Gallery until February 24</p>

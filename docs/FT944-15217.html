			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / International Company News: Bouygues ahead 18% midway at FFr94m Bouygues, the French construction, property and media group, yesterday reported an 18 per cent rise in first-half net consolidated profit to FFr94m (Dollars 17.76m), up from FFr79m in the same period of 1993. The group said that results at the dominant construction division, in terms of turnover, failed to reflect the general economic improvement in France, while in Africa it had had to contend with last January's 50 per cent devaluation of the CFA franc. The weak market in real estate led to a decline in revenue from property. Consolidated turnover rose to FFr33.6bn in the first half from the FFr29.3bn achieved in January-June of last year. However, this increase was due to accounting changes which allow Bouygues to consolidate in its figures turnover from TF1, the leading French television station in which Bouygues raised its stake to a controlling 34 per cent at the start of this year. The group predicted turnover of around FFr69bn for the full year, up from FFr61.2bn last year but again entirely accounted for by the newly-included activities of TF1. Earlier this month the consortium of which it is a member won from the French government the right to develop a third mobile phone network in France.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Helsinki April 4 TASS -- Russia's Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy criticised on Monday the idea of his country  joining the Council of Europe.    "We do not need your Council of Europe. We do not ask for  it. On the contrary, it is you who need us", leader of a  powerful faction in the russian parliament told reporters on  arrival in Helsinki. A delegation of Russian lawmakers is due  to take part in a parliamentary seminar here on prospects of the  Russian membership of the Council of Europe.    Zhirinovskiy stressed that his party (ultra-nationalist  party  misleadingly called Liberal-Democratic) "has nothing against  Finland". He complained that Finnish journalists lack true  information, apparently referring to local media reports  repeatedly calling him an advocate of Finland's re-joining  Russia.</p>

			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Inflation rises to 4.5% despite price cutting THE HEADLINE inflation rate increased last month, even though weak demand led to price reductions for a broad range of retail goods and services. The Central Statistical Office said yesterday the year-on-year increase in December in the retail prices index (RPI) was 4.5 per cent, compared with 4.3 per cent in November. Between the two months the index rose by 0.1 per cent, the smallest increase since July. There were price cuts in a varied group of items used in calculating the RPI, including petrol, processed fish, sherry, bicycles, clothing and estate agents' fees. Another factor was that prices of non-seasonal foods such as fruit increased last month by just 1.2 per cent compared with November, the smallest December rise since 1984. The figures indicate that the government's goal of achieving a further slowing in inflation this year is on target. It hopes that an easing in price pressures on consumers and industry will provide a springboard for sustained growth. Behind the statistics was widespread price-cutting in shops, especially for alcoholic drinks, clothing, furniture and personal goods, as retailers sought to tempt shoppers with bargains in the run-up to Christmas. It is expected that the effects of the widespread discounting will continue to show through in the January RPI figure. A gallon of 4-star petrol fell in price by 3p to Pounds 2.22 last month compared with November, leading to a 0.3 per cent fall on the month for motoring costs. Overall, the RPI rose from 135.6 in November to 135.7 last month - based on a weighting of 100 in January 1987. The increase between November and December in the year-on-year RPI rate was due to the effect of a 0.1 per cent fall in the index between the same months in 1990. That decrease had been triggered by large cuts in petrol and mortgage costs 13 months ago. Underlying retail-price inflation - the RPI without mortgage costs - showed a year-on-year rise last month of 5.8 per cent, up from 5.7 per cent in November. Many economists believe inflationary pressures will continue to ease over the next six months, as a result of a slowdown in the increase in wage costs and underlying weak demand. According to a price index calculated by Greenwell Montagu, the stockbroking firm, the yearly rise in 'core inflation' last month was 5.7 per cent, the same as in November. The index takes into account the RPI, without volatile items such as petrol, seasonal foods, electricity prices and the poll tax. Greenwell Montagu predicts the rate will slow to 5 per cent by June.</p>

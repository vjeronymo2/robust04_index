The protest note was handed to the Indian high  commissioner in Islamabad today. Briefing reporters, a Foreign  Office spokesman referred to statements by the Indian president  and by Salman Khurshid, minister of state for external affairs.  He said that India cannot use such vilification to divert the  world's attention from the atrocities being committed in  occupied Kashmir. He said that such statements reflect India's  helplessness in Kashmir, and give the impression that India has  no alternative but to resort to a vilification campaign in  defense of its policy of genocide.    When asked about the Kashmir visit by representatives of the  European countries, the spokesman said the diplomatic  representatives were not permitted to meet people freely. He  said they should visit Sopor, Kupwara, and Bijbiara, where gross  human rights violations are being committed.</p>

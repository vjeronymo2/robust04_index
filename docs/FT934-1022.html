			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Survey of Sweden (19): Hygiene and packaging helps SCA A strong bias towards hygiene products and packaging has helped SCA to become the most profitable of the Swedish forestry groups, writes Christopher Brown-Humes. Last year when most of its competitors in Finland and Sweden were heavily in the red, it managed a SKr451m profit. This year it is set to boost its surplus to about SKr1.1bn. Hygiene and packaging, which account for about two thirds of SCA's sales, have felt the effects of fierce international competition far less than other sectors of the pulp and paper industry, such as pulp and fine paper. Molnlycke, SCA's hygiene division, has proved a particular success story, even though it too has started to experience stiffer competition in the nappies market. SCA is building on its performance with a SKr3bn investment programme. Half the amount will be spent on a newsprint plant, based on 100 per cent recycled paper, at Aylesford in southern England. The South African group Mondi will be a joint venture partner in the project, which will have a capacity of 280,000 tonnes a year. By building the plant in the UK rather than in Sweden, SCA is acknowledging the fact that it is far more economic to locate newsprint production close to big population centres in Europe, rather than relying on virgin fibre in more sparsely-populated Scandinavia. The company calculates that it will cost SKr2,300-SKr2,500 to produce a tonne of newsprint in the UK, compared with about SKr3,000 in Sweden. 'Continuing with newsprint production in Scandinavia based on virgin fibre is going to be risky long-term due to the competitive pressure from low-priced, waste-based producers. In Sweden we have to concentrate on products which will give us a competitive edge,' says Mr Sverker Martin-Lof, SCA president. Underlining the point, the group is converting one of its existing Swedish newsprint mills to production of coated magazine paper.</p>

			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: US influences take equities higher in London - Market report The end of the week brought a sudden swing to the positive side of the equity market balance following a strong recovery in the dollar in the wake of the latest data on the US economy. Backed up by gains in British government bonds and in stock index futures, and finally by a burst of strength in early deals on Wall Street, the FT-SE 100 Share Index surged ahead in late afternoon. At the close, the FT-SE Index was 54.2 up at 3,083.8, only a touch off the day's high and spurred on by a December contract on the Footsie which was moving above the 3,100 mark. The Footsie moved through a range of nearly 60 points, dipping to the 3,024 area at mid-session when the market became nervous ahead of the US economic statistics. In the event, US markets took the view that the unexpectedly large growth of 3.4 per cent in US gross domestic product in the third quarter, balanced by unexpectedly low growth in the deflator figures, could be seen as very favourable for the economy and the securities markets. A powerful upswing in the dollar, together with a gain of nearly 50 points on the Dow Industrial Average in UK hours, sent the London market racing ahead. Dollar stocks led the way, the strongest gain coming in Reuters, the global electronic business information group, which also benefited from its trading report. Oil shares, with the big names on the brink of the reporting season, were also in demand. Insurance shares continued to brush off the report on personal pensions from the Securities and Investments Board. The market opened higher with much of the impetus coming from a dramatic move in the defence industry when GEC launched a Pounds 531.7m counter-bid for VSEL, the submarine builder, and later bought more than 13 per cent of VSEL's equity in the stock market. GEC shares rose sharply on its move, which tops the existing British Aerospace offer for VSEL, although this still has the support of the VSEL board. But Aerospace shares fell, reducing the value of its share offer, and the market appeared still uncertain of the outcome of the bid struggle. At last night's close, the Footsie was showing a gain of around 1.8 per cent over the week, but virtually all this came after 3pm yesterday. Trading volumes have been drying up for the past month and marketmakers paid the price yesterday when the sudden demand caught them without stock on their books. They responded by raising share prices quickly but were still obliged to deal and then search for stock in the market to meet their commitments. Seaq volume for the day totalled 508.9m shares, barely changed from the previous session and a bargains total of just over 22,000 remained well below daily averages for the past two years. Traders said that the institutions had stayed out of the market, leaving marketmakers to scramble for stock. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index rose by 21.5 to 3,501.6, somewhat left behind by the focus on the blue chip issues which are closely linked to trading in the stock index futures. Turnover in non-Footsie stocks, which are widely represented in the FT-SE Mid 250 Index made up only about 56 per cent of business yesterday, below recent daily averages. Dealers sounded unconvinced by the sudden upturn in the market. Retail issues were easier against the general trend on underlying worries that, in spite of the favourable response to the latest US economic data, the chances of a rise in UK base rates before Christmas are increasing as the domestic economy shows signs of stronger growth than the Bank of England, and the chancellor of the exchequer would like at this stage of the recovery cycle.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Maria Lilibeth La Corte from the "Union Radio </F> News" newscast]    [Text] Students who today accompanied the body of slain  student German Sotillo Rodriguez to the Southern General  Cemetery staged a march on (Baral) Avenue.    [Begin recording] [La Corte] As I said earlier, there were  disturbances on (Baral) Avenue, but they were efficiently  controlled by state security officers.    Students from the Fermin Toro High School burned a cargo  truck with license plate 109ADS. With me now is Colonel Augusto  Vera Lozada, chief of staff of Command No. 5. He will explain  how the riots were controlled. Good afternoon, commander.    [Vera Lozada] Good afternoon. Our forces have been deployed  to downtown Caracas to prevent violence; it is not our intention  to harm anyone. We are trying to provide security to prevent  the recurrence of incidents, and we will try to restore  transportation in this sector.    [La Corte] I have been told of attempts to loot stores in  this area. Is that true?    [Vera Lozada] No. So far nothing like that has happened. A  (?truck) was burned in front of Fermin Toro High School, but the  situation is under control.    [La Corte] Thank you, Col. Vera Lozada, who has informed us  that the disturbances have been controlled, although a few  students remain inside the school. However, the National Guard  and the Metropolitan Police have surrounded all adjacent  streets, including (Baral) Avenue and University Avenue, to  guarantee the public's safety. The situation is virtually under  control. [end recording]</p>

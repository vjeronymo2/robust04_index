			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Statutory Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 122 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 (Pub. L. 100&hyph;42, approved February 5, 1988) amended the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 (1937 Act) by adding a new section 20. In part, section 20 states as its purpose the encouragement of ``increased resident management of public housing projects [and the provision of funding] *&blank;*&blank;* to promote formation and development of resident management entities'' (Sec. 20(a)). Under section 20(f)(1): <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> [The Secretary shall provide financial assistance to resident management corporations or resident councils that obtain, by contract or otherwise, technical assistance for the development of resident management entities, including the formation of such entities, the development of the management capability of newly formed or existing entities, the identification of the social support needs of residents of public housing projects, and the securing of such support.] <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under section 20(f)(2), this financial assistance may not exceed $100,000 with respect to any public and Indian housing project, and subsection (f)(3) limits the assistance within the context of funds available under section 14 of the 1937 Act (Comprehensive Improvement Assistance Program). Section 20 is implemented in 24 CFR part 964 and, for Native American Programs, in 24 CFR part 905, subpart O. The rules set forth, among other things, the policies, procedures, and requirements of resident participation and management of public and Indian housing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In FY 1988, $2.5 million was awarded to 27 resident organizations; in FY 1989, $2.5 million was awarded to 35 resident organizations; in FY 1990, $2.4 million was awarded to 37 resident organizations; in FY 1991, $4.9 million was awarded to 96 organizations; in FY 1992 $4.6 million was awarded to 94 organizations; and in FY 1993, $4.7 million was awarded to 94 organizations. In FY 1994, $25 million is available for technical assistance and training for activities under the TOP program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Today, 383 resident groups throughout the country are in training under this public and Indian housing program. HUD supports the resident management movement, as well as other self-sufficiency and improvement programs designed to benefit public and Indian housing residents. The Office of Resident Initiatives in Public and Indian Housing has been created to deliver a variety of resident initiative programs, with assistance from a network of Resident Initiatives Coordinators (RICs) or Community Relations and Involvement Specialists (CRIs) in HUD's field structure. The RICs/CRIs are available to provide direct assistance to residents and resident groups interested in resident initiatives programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Key Features of This NOFA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) This NOFA announces the new Tenant Opportunity Program (TOP), which was formerly the Public and Indian Housing Resident Management Program. Resident organizations and housing authorities across the country overwhelmingly requested that the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) revamp the Resident Management Program to meet the needs in their communities for business development, education, job training and development, social services, and opportunities for other self-help initiatives. In complying with the request of residents and housing authorities, HUD has reinvented resident management and created the TOP. The new TOP will enable resident organizations to establish priorities based on the needs in their public and Indian housing communities aimed at furthering economic lift and independence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The authority for the TOP program comes from Section 20 of the 1937 Act; section 20(f) authorizes technical assistance and training. Financial assistance in the form of technical assistance grants is provided by the Secretary to resident grantees to prepare for management activities in their housing development (hereinafter referred to as TOP technical assistance grants). Technical assistance grants are available for ``the development of resident management entities, including the formation of such entities, the development of the management capability of newly formed or existing entities, the identification of the social support needs of residents of public housing projects and the securing of such support.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TOP technical assistance grants prepare residents to manage their projects or portions of their projects. The results are significant and multifaceted. For example, resident-managed activities have resulted in economic development, resident self-sufficiency, improved living conditions, and enhanced social services for residents (i.e., child care and other youth projects). TOP will provide public and Indian housing residents the opportunity to be trained and move toward a responsible role in their community. The training will aim to enhance the functioning of the resident council as well as gain skills to engage in resident managed activities in its community. TOP will strongly encourage resident organizations to develop a partnership with a public or Indian housing authority (hereafter referred to as ``HA''). Secretary Cisneros is committed to building a real partnership among HAs, residents, and HUD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The ``Mini Grants'' are eliminated this year for the purpose of streamlining program requirements. RCs/RMCs/ROs that have been in existence for several years or that were recently formed may receive up to $100,000 for start-up activities, as well as for community organizing, participation in public and Indian housing and community affairs, and training in other tenant opportunities activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) All resident grantees that are selected for funding (including additional funding grantees) will access the grant funds through a line of credit control system (LOCCS), as explained in Section I.D, ``Funding,'' of this NOFA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) An application kit is required as the formal submission to apply for funding. The kit includes information on the preparation of a Work Plan and Budget for activities proposed by the applicant. This process facilitates the expeditious execution of a TOP Technical Assistance Grant (TOP TAG) for those applicants that are selected to receive funding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The information listed below is regarding  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> all HOPE I grantees:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

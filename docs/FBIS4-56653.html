			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on an interview with President Fidel Castro by </F> station reporter Gisela Veleredia in Georgetown; date not given  -- recorded]    [Text] In what was considered the most important aspect of  the Cuban delegation's visit to Barbados, President Fidel Castro  placed a wreath at the very place where a Barbados airliner [as  heard] crashed in 1976. Several members of the Cuban fencing  team died in the accident, along with other Caribbean citizens.  The commander in chief, visibly moved, said he had thought  about this moment from the time he decided to travel to  Barbados. He also gave us his opinion on the decisions made at  the First World Conference on Sustainable Development of Small  Island States.    [Begin recording] [Veleredia] What do the expressions of  solidarity you received from the Caribbean leaders at this  conference mean for Cuba?    [Castro] Such expressions of solidarity and friendship have  always been extremely important to us as this [words indistinct].    [Veleredia] Did you think of this moment when you decided to  come to Barbados?    [Castro] Yes, it was the first thing I thought about.    [Veleredia] Do you think that every Cuban who travels to  Barbados thinks of the events that took place here?    [Castro] What is this place called? It is not very far from  where the tragedy occurred.    [Veleredia] [Words indistinct] opportunity?    [Castro] There always is and there always will be.    [Veleredia] Could you comment on the other activities of the  day in this first visit to Barbados?    [Castro] I have been able to do several things. I met with  the media and had several other individual meetings. Later  today I will visit the governor, who is the [word indistinct]  and the minister of justice.    [Veleredia] [Words indistinct]    [Castro] They were very friendly toward Cuba. I expect to  see a few other things and meet some of the country's leaders of  [words indistinct].    [Veleredia] Are you pleased with this first visit to an  English-speaking Caribbean nation?    [Castro] Very pleased, but I have not really had a chance to  get to know the people. I have only seen the streets and  buildings. The people here are very warm and welcoming and very  polite. I have been very impressed.    [Unidentified reporter] After meeting with the people of  this  island, do you still maintain that Cuba came to this forum with  a broad based political commitment?    [Castro] Or course. You cannot come to this meeting or this  country with any other idea. Contacts with these island nations  were initiated in Rio de Janeiro. I felt the enormous concern  these nations have about the changing climate and the rising  waters. They are experiencing a dramatic situation. This is a  matter of life or death to them. Any natural phenomenon would  have the same effect on any country, but it has a greater  importance for these people.    [Reporter] Even when many developed nations [words  indistinct].    [Castro] They have been absent, but I perceive a greater  degree of awareness about these problems than there was in Rio  de Janeiro.    [Veleredia] Do you think this meeting and your visit will  pave the way for closer relations?    [Castro] The road is already being paved. Anything that  works in that direction will contribute to closer ties. It is  very important to talk with the leaders and learn what they are  thinking. You know I did not miss a minute of the conference.  [Words indistinct] I congratulate you because you were there  all the time.    [Veleredia] The prime minister of Barbados said he would  work to solve the differences that prevent Cuba from becoming  part of the Organization of Caribbean States. What are the  major differences?    [Castro] There are no differences between us.    [Veleredia] I meant the obstacles to Cuban integration.    [Castro] The ones that already exist and are known. [end  recording]    The commander in chief defied the ridges and climbed down to  the beach to allow the (?waves) to touch his feet, thus honoring  the martyrs who died in Barbados. Today the commander was to  continue his agenda here in Barbados, which includes a visit  with Governor Nita Barrow.</p>

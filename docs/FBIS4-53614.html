			<p>BFN     [Text] In response to Fair Trade Commission [FTC]  guidance, the three major automakers--Toyota Motor Corp., Nissan  Motor Co., Ltd., and Mitsubishi Motors Corp.--have corrected  their own conventional transaction system with affiliated auto  dealers. With the new corrected system, the dealers will be able  to deal in more foreign-made autos. The purpose behind the  automakers' change in the dealership system is to promote auto  dealers' sales of foreign-made autos by changing a system of  rebates paid by automakers to dealers and by abandoning a system  of allocating sales areas (territory system). As far as a  dealership contract concluded in 1991 between automakers and  dealers is concerned, the auto manufacturers allow the dealers  to sell foreign-made automobiles. The recent change in the  transaction system will further promote the dealers' sales of  foreign-made autos. In this way, the dealers will be able to  engage in sales activities more freely while consumers will have  more choices in buying automobiles. Since the United States, in  negotiations on easing the auto trade dispute with Japan, has  pointed out the closed nature of Japan's auto dealership system,  it is possible that the recent move by the three major  automakers will have favorable impact on deadlocked Japan-U.S.  economic framework talks.    In late April, the three automakers, including Toyota,  submitted to the FTC a measure to correct the conventional  transaction with affiliated dealers, and they recently adopted  the new dealership system. The FTC formerly pointed out that  the conventional agreement between automakers and dealers --  that the automakers will pay dealers a rebate commensurate with  the degree of reaching their sales target which is set by the  automakers but is very hard to achieve and that a rebate will  not be applied to sales of autos which are sold outside the  dealer's allocated territorial sales area -- is questionable,  saying the agreement might run counter to the Antimonopoly Law,  under which "an act of restricting affiliated dealers' sales of  other makers' automobiles and of limiting sales areas" is  prohibited.    In the past, setting up dealers' sales targets, Toyota  conducted a "sales campaign" for almost a year and paid a rebate  commensurate with the number of cars sold. But under the new  system, Toyota has halved the campaign period and cut the amount  of rebate to be paid per auto sold. In the past, Toyota paid a  rebate based on its system of evaluating affiliated dealers.  Toyota based its evaluation of the dealers on the volume of  transaction and the sales share in their respective territorial  sales areas. However, Toyota has decided not to emphasize the  sales share in paying rebates.    Like Toyota, Nissan, in evaluating its affiliated dealers'  sales performance, which is a base for a rebate system, has  decided to place more emphasis on the autos actually sold not  only within the dealers' allocated sales territory but also  outside the territory. Meanwhile, Mitsubishi has decided to  apply a rebate to autos sold outside dealers' sales territories.    The dealership contract between an automaker and a dealer  allows the dealer to freely sell automobiles outside their  allocated sales areas. In fact, however, major auto  manufacturers have so far adopted a system of "one dealer, one  prefecture," for certain types of autos, and the dealer received  from the automaker a rebate calculated on the total number of  cars sold. But it was pointed out that such a practice limits  sales areas.    On the contrary, in the United States and Europe, a rebate  system is generally adopted for each type of auto, not for the  total number of autos sold. In the United States, automakers  get involved in setting up dealers, but they do not limit sales  areas. As far as the rebate system is concerned, it can be said  that the recent change in the dealership system has paved the  way for dealers to deal in as many foreign-made cars as  Japanese-made ones.</p>

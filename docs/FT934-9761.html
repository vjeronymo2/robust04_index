			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / International Company News: Ferfin mulls legal action against accountants THE NEW management of Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin), the troubled Italian industrial group with total borrowings of more than L28,000bn (Dollars 17bn), has proposed legal action against Price Waterhouse, the international accounting group which audited its books. The decision, to be put to a shareholders' meeting later this month, is a second blow to Price Waterhouse. In August, Consob, Italy's companies and stock markets watchdog, revoked the firm's authorisation to audit Ferfin's books, on the grounds that it had failed to reveal alleged accounting mismanagement and political corruption. Ferfin, which announced a first-half 1993 loss of L1,136bn, accused the accountants of 'negligence' and 'lack of skill' in auditing its books. Price Waterhouse was unavailable for comment last night. Ferfin's new board, largely appointed by the group of five Italian creditor banks which recently prepared a restructuring plan, also issued a tough warning to foreign bank creditors still undecided about the proposed debt moratorium and reorganisation. Continued opposition to the plan beyond November 30 could risk the salvage operation, Ferfin warned. It has called a special shareholders' meeting at the end of this month to approve a substantial capital increase. To underline the claim that the group remained fundamentally sound, Ferfin issued partial nine-month figures showing a continuing improvement in its performance. Group sales jumped 16.4 per cent, to L16,779bn, while gross operating profits rose 26 per cent to L1,987bn. In an attempt to win over recalcitrant foreign banks, many of which have been incensed by the restructuring plans, Mr Guido Rossi, Ferfin's chairman, last week held talks in New York with Citibank, a leading foreign creditor.</p>

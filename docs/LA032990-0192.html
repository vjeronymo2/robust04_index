			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE;  </P> <P> THIEVES HAD BIG HAUL OF STORED VALUABLES  </P> <P> The Orange Police Department on Wednesday announced five arrests in a theft  ring in which hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of property was stolen,  mostly from self-storage facilities throughout the county.  </P> <P> Police have recovered some of the property, including coins, stamps, U.S.  currency dating back to the Civil War, vacuum cleaners, computers, VCRs, and  jewelry.  </P> <P> The burglars picked the locks at the storage facilities and then replaced them,  so many victims did not notice that items were missing, police said.  </P> <P> Officers of Orange's special enforcement detail began investigating the  burglary ring last fall after they discovered stolen property at the residence  of a suspect. Police say the ring could have been operating for as long as four  years.  </P> <P> Arrested were Tim Gabriel, 32, of Anaheim on seven counts of possession of  stolen property and William McBride, 25, of Orange on charges of auto theft and  violation of parole.  </P> <P> Police have also arrested two people suspected of exchanging methamphetamines  and cocaine for stolen property and an associate of one of the two. Officers  declined to release the names of these three suspects.  </P> <P> Orange police are continuing the investigation with 10 other police agencies  and expect to recover more stolen property. To inquire about the stolen  property, which is being stored at the Orange Police Department substation in  Santiago Hills, call Sgt. Mike Pollok at (714) 532-0313. SHANNON SANDS  </P></p>

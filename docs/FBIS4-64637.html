			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Excerpt] Turkish Grand National Assembly Speaker  Husamettin Cindoruk has said that the PKK [Workers Party of  Kurdistan] terrorist movement and not the Turkish-Kurdish  dispute is the source of the incidents in south and southeast  Anatolia. TRT correspondent Kudret Dogandemir reports from  Paris:    [Begin Dogandemir recording] Cindoruk is continuing his  contacts in Paris. Cindoruk devoted his day to the French  National Assembly and the Senate with the aim of promoting  relations between the parliaments of the two countries.    Cindoruk, in Paris on an official visit, held a breakfast  meeting with National Assembly President Phillipe Seguin.  During the meeting, Seguin stated that Turkey is a very  powerful country in its region. In turn, Cindoruk stated that  Turkey is conducting deliberate and persistent efforts to enter  the European Union.    Cindoruk later signed the National Assembly guest book, and  Seguin presented Cindoruk with a plaque.    Cindoruk later met with the head of the Socialist caucus,  (Martin Malve), and answered questions on the PKK. Pointing out  that the PKK is a terrorist organization, Cindoruk recalled that  Germany and France have banned PKK activities in their  countries. Explaining that racism was never an issue in the  transition from the Ottoman identity to the Turkish identity,  Cindoruk stressed that everybody in Turkey has equal freedom and  rights.    Cindoruk said that like France, which does not want Corsica  to be divided or to break away, Turkey also does not want the  unity of the state to be disrupted. Pointing out that the  terrorists kill the old, the young, and the innocent  indiscriminately, Cindoruk said: They both kill people and burn  machines. They force the parties and newspapers in those  regions to shut down. Cindoruk added that unfortunately, certain  countries support those who are working against Turkey and use  the human rights issue as an excuse.    (Malve) said Turkey has taken important steps toward  development. [passage omitted] [end recording]</p>

			<p>`Scandal'   <F P=102>   PA2206162594 Santa Fe de Bogota Emisoras Caracol Network in  Spanish 1200 GMT 22 Jun 94 </F>  <F P=103> PA2206162594 </F> <F P=104>  Santa Fe de Bogota Emisoras Caracol Network </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Senator Alvaro Pava by </F> unidentified station announcer in Santa Fe de Bogota and Caracol  News Director Dario Arizmendi in Los Angeles, California; from  "Caracol's 0600 to 0900" newscast--live]    [Text] Senator Alvaro Pava has been mentioned in a recorded  conversation which, the government has admitted, included the  participation of journalist Alberto Giraldo and the Rodriguez  Orejuela brothers. The government, which has made a comparison,  has confirmed the voices in the recording belong to them,  according to a Defense Ministry communique.    During the conversation between Giraldo and one of the  Rodriguez Orejuela brothers, Giraldo says he had already talked  with Pava, who had everything arranged. Last night, the "CMI"  television newscast even reported that Giraldo had telephoned  the station saying he had received a message from Rodriguez  Orejuela offering to finance the campaigns of Andres Pastrana  and Ernesto Samper, an offer which neither of the two candidates  accepted. According to the "CMI" newscast, Giraldo had said he  had talked with Pava and Hernandez of the Pastrana campaign and  Santiago Medina of the Samper campaign but that neither of the  two campaigns accepted the money the Rodriguez Orejuela brothers  had offered.    We have Pava on the telephone and will ask him what he has  to  say about this report linking him to this scandal of the alleged  participation of tainted money to finance presidential  campaigns. Good morning, Dr. Pava.    Pava: I am, of course, angry and shocked at the  report that my name has been mentioned in connection with this  type of conversation. I am particularly grieved by it. I have  been listening to remarks by journalists and other people  involved. The Attorney General's Office and control agencies  that are determining the authenticity of the recording and the  fact that it has been confirmed are likewise very important. I  have known Giraldo for many years, as has the entire country.  He is a respectable journalist and is a very important man  socially.    As manager of Dr. Pastrana's campaign, I had no authority to  collect any money. As Dr. Pastrana will surely explain during  his news conference at 1000, such a collection was not my  responsibility.    For the good of the country, institutions, and democracy, it  is important to clarify this bothersome episode, which,  nevertheless, mars the prestige of Colombian institutions. For  the good of all, and as the president-elect has said, the  Attorney General's Office should conduct a thorough  investigation to confirm, as quickly as possible, that what I  have said is the truth. It assuages me to know that remarks  have been made affirming and clarifying the facts. I have  nothing to fear, but I am very upset that my name was mentioned  in the cassette.    Announcer: I will now connect you with our news  director, Dario Arizmendi, who is in the United States.    Arizmendi: I would like you to answer a question  that is surely in the minds of many fellow countrymen. When Dr.  Pastrana made a speech at the Tequendama Hotel on 19 June  admitting his defeat, did he already know of the existence of  the cassette and that it involved the leaders of the Samper  campaign in this money deal that was apparently being secured  through journalist Giraldo?    Pava: Would you please repeat the question?    Announcer: Arizmendi's question is this: On 19  June, when Pastrana said it was necessary to determine whether  there was some participation of tainted money in the  presidential elections, were the Pastrana campaigners aware of  the existence of the cassettes disclosed today?    Pava: According to a Defense Ministry communique  that was released last night, Dr. Pastrana personally handed the  cassettes with the conversations to the president of the  Republic on 16 June. An unidentified person had given him the  cassettes in Cali; therefore, I believe it can be said that he  was familiar with the text of those recordings and that for this  reason he revealed them to the authorities so an investigation  could be conducted.    Arizmendi: Is Giraldo's version as told to the  "CMI" newscast true that he had talked with you and Dr. (Veliz)  of the Pastrana campaign to present the offer of the Rodriguez  Orejuela brothers to finance the campaign, an offer to which you  replied no?    Pava: I am not familiar with that version. I could  not say yes or no to something I did not handle. Giraldo must  be regarded in the context of his life. You and the country  know him. Let the people know that Alberto is a journalist who  talks with political circles everyday. He has excellent  relations. He is a friend of the president and all the  ministers, former President Betancur, and the two presidential  candidates. He has excellent relations and continually talks  with the media. He is familiarly well-known as Crazy Man  Giraldo due to his eccentricities. He is very well-known in the  country.    He is always making inquiries, investigating campaigns. I  had some responsibility in the campaign, and he was always  asking me questions about the campaign. In addition, the  country must know that since 1976 or 1977, he was attached to  Cadena Radial Super, where I was deputy manager. He was  assistant director for Javier Ayala, one of the leading Caracol  journalists and his personal friend. You all know him. Let the  people know that he is always talking with national leaders, has  lunch and talks with people.    I have talked with Giraldo about the campaign many times but  not on the subject of money. May I repeat that I had nothing to  do with it. I did not have to handle that or any other matter  in the campaign. Of course, morally speaking, I could not  accept a conversation of that kind. It was proposed to me, and  I turned it down, of course. I could not hold such a  conversation for moral principles and because it was not my  responsibility during the campaign. I did not have to manage  anything regarding money. My responsibility was a different  one, as Pastrana will surely affirm during his news conference.    Arizmendi: What will Pastrana say during his news  conference today at 1000?    Pava: I do not know what he will say. You will  have to ask him. I suppose he will explain the campaign's  position, which has been very clear. Pastrana's position will  not be changed either in his public or private life. I suppose  this will be his position, but I do not know what he will tell  the media that have been invited to his news conference at 1000.    Arizmendi: How do you interpret Giraldo's remarks  that he talked with you and Dr. [name indistinct] to offer the  money that you refused?    Pava: The Attorney General's Office will  investigate this remark, which upsets me. I expect the Attorney  General's Office and investigative agencies to establish the  truth. May I repeat: I could not have accepted any such  dialogue because it was not my responsibility. If it was  proposed to me, surely I turned it down, because, morally  speaking, I cannot accept such a dialogue for obvious reasons.    Arizmendi: What do you think of Samper's initial  position? Are you satisfied with his explanation?    Pava: I believe the president-elect has spoken  clearly. The two campaigns should ask the authorities to  clarify this matter. From the viewpoint of the institutions,  this speculation risks much regarding the institutions. The  country requires absolute clarity on the subject. The president  has spoken very clearly and has inspired confidence in the  country regarding management of the money the campaign had used.  We hope his assertion will coincide with the result of the  investigation that the proper authorities will conduct.</p>

			<p><P> October 2, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Rain soaked the debris-strewn streets of Charleston, but survivors of the  coastal city ravaged by Hurricane Hugo banded together to give thanks for life.  Morris Street Baptist Church, as in many areas of the city, remained without  power 10 days after Hugo's 135-m.p.h. winds hit, but Sunday school and services  were held in the natural light from windows. The Rev. Jesse Jackson, a South  Carolina native, visited the church and met a caravan of trucks with supplies  from Washington, D.C. Thousands still are without power, and more than 1,000  people in Charleston and outlying areas sought shelter with the Red Cross.  Drinking water has been restored to many, but residents were asked to conserve  water because of sewage problems.  </P></p>

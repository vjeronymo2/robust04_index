			<p>BFN     [Text] Shenyang, March 4 (XINHUA) -- More than 50,000  farmers in Shenyang, provincial capital of northeast China's  Liaoning, have become share-holders of local rural enterprises.    According to local officials, Shenyang, an old industrial  center, has got 8,000 rural and township enterprises. Last  year, these enterprises created 20 billion yuan (about 2.3  billion U.S. dollars) worth of output, accounting for one third  of the city's total industrial output value.    About 3,000 out of the 8,000 rural enterprises have been  transformed into joint-stock ones, and funds from shares of  farmers- turned employees have made up some 500 million yuan.    The city began trial transformation of designated rural and  township enterprises into joint-stock ones in 1985 and gained  some positive experience. Last year, the city extended the  transformation to the whole city and saw an emergence of 2,000  joint-stock firms in the city's rural areas.    Rural enterprises run under a joint-stock system not only  help enhance the sense of responsibility of workers, but also  help stop up outside interference, said the officials, adding  that the joint-stock system is an effective way to vitalize  management and to build a modern enterprise system in rural  enterprises.</p>

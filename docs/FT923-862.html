			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Business Travel Management (5): For want of a policy - Europe's companies are at last coming to terms with a problem DO YOU know your company's policy towards travelling on business? Does it even have a formal travel policy? For many executives, the answer to both questions is decidedly in the negative. While business travel and associated costs such as entertainment and lodgings represent significant expenditure for companies large and small, the approach to controlling these expenses has been largely dilatory over the past decade. 'Business travel is more often than not a company's third largest controllable expenditure after information technology and salaries,' points out Mr Graeme Payne, director of Reed Travel Training, which runs courses in business travel planning for secretaries and in-house travel organisers. 'Yet in spite of the recession, corporate travel policies are still much less in evidence in Europe than America,' he adds. But Europe is catching up. The latest biennial American Express survey of corporate travel practices - the fifth in the series - reveals that for the first time a slight majority (52 per cent) of the 400 companies surveyed had a formal written travel policy. A further 43 per cent said they had informal guidelines only, while one in 20 of those surveyed had no travel policy at all. Analysis of the Amex survey shows that over a quarter (29 per cent) of companies with 20 or more employees who travel regularly on business had a formal policy, rising to 71 per cent for companies with 50 or more travelling staff. By type of industry, the Amex survey shows that service companies are most likely to have a formal policy, while distribution companies are least likely to have one. Formulating a travel policy is, according to the survey, usually done by the board or management committee - cited by some 62 per cent of companies sampled by Amex. In larger companies, however, it is sometimes an administration or personnel function which formulates the policy. Top management support is vital for having a successful policy. 'This support can be gained in many ways, although the most effective is to carry out an audit of the company's expense claims and travel and entertainment expenditure,' points out Mr Jim Jamison, Amex's executive vice-president for travel management services. 'By auditing a random sample of reports, the company will have a far better picture of current travel practices, areas of waste or abuse and opportunities for cost savings.' But he warns of the danger of operating a travel policy half-heartedly. 'Many companies make the mistake of wanting to save travel costs but not being willing to make any real sacrifices to achieve this. Such indecision can render any travel policy unworkable.' Moreover, when formulating a policy it is important to gain the support of all those involved in the travel management process - including travellers, secretaries who book travel, managers who authorise the expenditures and personnel, finance and audit staff. Many policies fail because they are imposed from above without any reference to those actually involved in the travel. Of course, the biggest drawback to a policy working successfully in practice comes from business travellers themselves. As more and more companies attempt to restrict travel in business and first-class on airlines, for example, so executives seek ways round the policy. 'Travel is a highly personal business and nearly every executive has personal views and preferences about the type of hotel airline and so on,' points out Mr Richard LoveIl, managing director of Wagons-Lits Travel, formerly Pickfords Business Travel. He cites the example of companies which restrict all air journeys of six hours or under to economy class, except where the traveller has a medical reason such as a bad back to fly business class. 'This has led to a proliferation of bad backs in the business world,' he suggests. Flying is one of the major direct costs of business travel and therefore an area where travel policy is most keenly applied. Some three-quarters of companies in the Amex survey with a formal travel policy also exercised control over employees' air travel. However, that can be the area of management control which most irritates executive travellers. Why, they argue, should they be increasingly forced to fly economy class when this leaves them exhausted on arrival from coping with cramped seats, noisy children and 'back-packing' tourists? This is an issue where excessive concern with controlling costs can sometimes work against the effective carrying out of business. But there is a further complication. Many airlines seek to avoid corporate travel policies by selling direct to a traveller who has the incentive, for example, of a free economy ticket if a business class seat is booked. 'Such methods are a source of considerable irritation to much of travel management since it is well nigh impossible for a company to benefit from these incentives,' points out Mr LoveIl. Moreover, there is the incentive of frequent flyer programmes. Many executives insist on flying with a particular airline to gain benefits such as Air Miles (from British Airways) or those schemes offered by US carriers. Few companies, it seems, ask their executives for the frequent flyer points to be allocated to the company. A travel policy, however, should not be viewed as just a means of determining the class of airline flight or quality of hotel. The policy should cover all aspects of travel management: from the planning of the journey, through to those making the actual arrangements, on to the funding and payment systems used, and to how the expenses are reconciled. It is also important to ensure that all those involved are given a written copy of the policy: where companies rely on 'word of mouth' to spread the policy, then misinterpretations easily (and sometimes intentionally) arise. The policy should also, where feasible, be given to any regular travel suppliers, such as hotels, car rental companies, and travel agents. It should be regularly monitored - often with the help of management information supplied by business travel agents or charge card operators  - and regularly reviewed, perhaps on an annual basis or more often if market conditions are changing rapidly. Perhaps the most important point about a travel policy, however, is identified by the Amex survey. This emphasises that a travel policy will only bring about cost savings if it is actually applied in practice. The survey found that 51 per cent of companies claimed to have negotiated special rates for hotel accommodation - yet only 39 per cent actually stipulated which hotels their staff should use. American Express said it was 'puzzled' why a 'sizeable number of companies do not insist on employees using the very hotels for which favourable rates had been specially negotiated'.</p>

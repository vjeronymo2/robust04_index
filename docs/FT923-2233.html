			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Arts: Today's Television The blurring of the line between factual and fictional crime, pursued by the BBC in 'Crimewatch UK' with dramatised versions of real crimes, is taken a stage further by ITV's series Crime Story (9.00). The tales here are 'based on' true crimes but they are 'not so much about crime and detection', more about 'passion, jealousy, greed or irrational love'. Writers have 'elaborated' upon what really happened to create 'high quality original drama'. In the first of three programmes about tribal passions, Under The Sun (9.00 BBC2) goes to the Yugoslav province of Kosovo, ruled by Serbs, who regard it as the birthplace of their civilisation, but inhabited by a population which is 80 per cent ethnic Albanian. BBC1's excellent police series Between The Lines (9.30), about an internal investigation unit, features a complaint about sexual harrassment against a black sergeant. His feelings about the woman police officer are awfully like those of investigator Tony Clark towards his Wpc mistress. Terry And Julian (10.30 C4) is the closest that television has come to its own 'Carry On' series - 'Carry On Limp Wristedly'.</p>

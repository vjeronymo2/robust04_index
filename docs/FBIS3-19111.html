In the statement Berlusconi will insist that the charges  levelled against Pubitalia are nothing more than "a house of  cards. There are no skeletons in our closet," he quipped this  evening. "At the most one might find a couple of crutches," he  continued.    Then, getting more serious, Berlusconi said that the rules  must apply to all, and that that went for public ministers as  well, "who should respect these rules even more than the others."    Six persons, including the chairman and two managers of  Publitalia, were reported by a Berlusconi channel Wednesday as  being the objects of preventive detention requests in a case of  alleged false invoices to cover a 6.5 billion lire kickback in  the world record transfer of soccer star Gianluigi Lentini for  an official 18 billion lire from Torino to AC Milan 18 months  ago.    Revealing the names of Publitalia chairman Marcello  Dell'Utri, Publitalia managers Valerio Gerardelli and Romano  Luzzi, and "three external managers, a husband and wife named  Onorabile and a certain Lecci," the flagship Fininvest Canale 5  news [TG5] admitted that it was "probably breaking the law" but  stressed its intention was not to alert the named persons to  take flight.    "An unprecedented political attack...old and absolutely  risible cases that could be cleared up in five minutes but are  turned by the media into a looming dragnet," was the immediate  comment of Berlusconi, the Fininvest owner, who stepped down  from the helm of his media-to-retail empire when he took the  political field with his Forza Italia (Go Italy) movement to  beat the left in the March 27-28 elections.    At a press conference today Berlusconi claimed that within  the Clean Hands pool of magistrates there were those who sought  justice and those who played politics.    Meanwhile Justice Minister Giovanni Conso has opened an  investigation into the leaking of the names of those Fininvest  managers to be served warrants, names which were made public by  TG5 before the preliminary judge in the case arrived at any  decision in the matter.    Meanwhile, it was learned here this evening that Berlusconi  and Adriano Galliani, respectively president and managing  director of the professional First Division soccer team, Milano,  could, within the next few days, be called before Milan judges  looking into the transfer of Gianluigi Lentini from Torino to  the Milano team. The former head of the Torino team, Gianmauro  Borsano, gave testimony today.</p>

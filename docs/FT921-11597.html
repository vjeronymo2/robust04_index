			<p>920130 FT  30 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Initial losses in equities soon reduced THE UK stock market bounced back from early losses yesterday, with firmness in sterling and a promising start on Wall Street helping offset the mild disappointment which had greeted President Bush's State of the Union message. Equity trading in London remained unimpressive but UK opinion polls continued to favour the electoral prospects of Mr John Major's government, and the late improvement in sterling revived optimism for an early cut in domestic base rates. The FT-SE Index closed at 2,546.5, with the final loss of 5.5 on the day representing a two-thirds recovery from the initial setback. Equities gave ground in early trading in London, brushing off Wall Street's peak close overnight, which had preceded President Bush's speech. While the UK market was keeping a close eye on Wall Street, investment confidence also continued to suffer from the pessimistic tone of the latest business opinion survey from the Confederation of British Industry, which indicated a big fall in confidence among UK businessmen. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew commented that the survey implied that weakening in the supply side of the UK economy 'bodes ill' for the trade performance when domestic activity recovers. Nor was there any relief yesterday from the steady flow of corporate profits downgradings for leading UK companies by City analysts. The big investment funds backed off from equities yesterday, and the Seaq network reported volume of 549.7m shares, little changed from Tuesday's 551.8m; retail volume on Tuesday totalled an unexciting Pounds 952m. The reduction in institutional demand for UK equities is believed to reflect the uncertainties introduced by the apparent opening of the UK election season, which has brought increased focus on day to day opinion poll readings. Utility stocks, seen as at risk in the event of a Labour election victory, again responded strongly to the apparent improvement in the government's opinion ratings. However, many international blue chips were held back by weakness in the US dollar in which many of their profits are recorded. The exception was Fisons, the pharmaceutical group whose shares have traced an erratic pattern recently but have now attracted speculative support again. Elsewhere among the drug stocks, Wellcome provided one of the few firm spots, while Glaxo continued to react from the strong performance during the early sessions of this year. The Footsie Index was held back towards the close by a dull showing from the leading oil stocks, with Shell running into a bout of international selling in late dealings. However, sluggish turnover in the stock market in no way inhibited the institutions from activity elsewhere in the City of London. Both First Leisure, Britain's largest leisure industry company, and Medeva, the pharmaceutical group, featured in strongly attended presentations to fund managers hosted by UK brokerage houses. Stock market analysts continued to pursue policies of stock and sector selection, rather than trying to predict the general outlook for equities. At Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, Sushil Wadhwani recommended a high relative yield strategy and recommended food retailing, life assurance, aerospace and electronics stocks.</p>

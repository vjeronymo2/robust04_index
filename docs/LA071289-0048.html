			<p><P> July 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DNC LEFTIES TOO MUCH FOR GOP; WIN STREAK OVER  </P> <P> After 25 years of eating Republican dust -- softball dust -- the Democrats were  starving for a big win at the annual slugfest simply called "The Game." They  wanted it so badly Tuesday night that they were eager to play in 96-degree  heat.  </P> <P> The Democratic National Committee versus the Republican National Committee  midsummer softball match on the Ellipse wasn't a game; it was a three-hour  campaign led by DNC Chairman Ron Brown and RNC Chairman Lee Atwater.  </P> <P> Brown predicted a victory because of "new leadership" at the DNC. "We don't  want to hurt them too badly. Atwater's had enough of a hard time lately," he  said.  </P> <P> Atwater, wearing a bright red Hawaiian shirt and "Late Night With David  Letterman" baseball cap, explained that his players were the same ones who won  last year's presidential campaign. Winners.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Different Sorts of Fans  </P> <P> The Republicans showed up with more than 200 fans sporting the latest in  upscale chic, with crates of Gatorade, soda and beer, and T-shirts featuring an  elephant playing a guitar.  </P> <P> The Democrats had barely 25 fans in the stands, a couple of coolers filled with  water and "RUN DNC" red-and-white jerseys.  </P> <P> It was 2-0 GOP at the end of the first inning. By the end of the second, the  Republican team was leading 5-1.  </P> <P> "This game is a little statement in itself," said Steve Sterling, one of the  many Republicans wearing, despite the heat, a gray suit, white shirt, blue tie  and matching reflecting sunglasses. "This game is a blowout already. Like  always, they'll never make it the distance."  </P> <P> But the Democrats loped, dived and scrambled for five runs in the third inning.  </P> <P> "Notice that the Democrats have scored all their runs with smashing line drives  down the left field line because the Republicans can't cover the left. They  don't understand it," said James Ruvolo, chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tied in the Sixth  </P> <P> By the end of the sixth inning, all the fans had spilled out of the stands and  were roaring on the sidelines as the two teams battled to an 8-8 tie.  </P> <P> The DNC drove in the winning run in the top of the ninth inning and,  miraculously -- even to the Democrats -- successfully defended their lead to  win their first game in 25 years.  </P> <P> "We had a lot of intensity and a lot of talent," Brown shouted. What about  luck? "No, no. Leadership. I would attribute it to leadership."  </P> <P> "Softball's one thing; politics is something else," Atwater said. "I guess  maybe I'm better at hardball than at softball."  </P></p>

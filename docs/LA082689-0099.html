			<p><P> August 26, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOXING;  </P> <P> ZARAGOZA IS MORE THAN MERE MORSEL AMID THE ALPHABET SOUP  </P> <P> Last time we checked, the alphabet-soup guys who run professional boxing from  three different directions were listing 46 "world" champions in 51 weight  divisions.  </P> <P> They can agree on only one champion, Mike Tyson. Three other boxers are  recognized as champions by two governing bodies, but in 13 weight classes, each  of the three organizations -- the World Boxing Assn., the World Boxing Council  and the International Boxing Federation -- has its own champion.  </P> <P> It's so bad that a boxing follower almost needs a home computer to keep track  of the champions and contenders. After all, how many know, for example, that  Napa Katwanchai is the WBC's strawweight (105 pounds or less) champion? Or that  Katwanchai is from Thailand?  </P> <P> And if you can identify Kaosai Galaxi as the WBA junior-bantamweight champion,  you're world class.  </P> <P> Point is, with boxing being so poorly served by three feuding governing bodies,  it's easy to overlook an outstanding champion today, such as Daniel Zaragoza of  Mexico City, who will defend the WBC (or is it the IBF?) super-bantamweight  championship at the Forum Thursday night against Frankie Duarte.  </P> <P> One night in June, Zaragoza took on Southland favorite Paul Banke at the Forum  and showed a crowd of 4,500 how a champion fights.  </P> <P> Banke is dangerous with his hook, but he is often off balance when he misses.  He got caught twice in the first round by Zaragoza, and Zaragoza's manager,  Rafael Mendoza, says today that Zaragoza won that fight in the first round.  </P> <P> "Look at the video of that first round," he said. "Daniel caught him twice on  the inside with short shots to the head, and Banke never really got into a  rhythm after that."  </P> <P> But to many that night, it seemed that Zaragoza saved his championship late,  under fire.  </P> <P> While Banke was taking shots from both inside and long range, Zaragoza was  steady and cool. Steady? He was a rock -- even in the ninth, when Banke floored  him with a left hook.  </P> <P> Banke, trailing on nearly everyone's scorecard, seemed to turn the fight around  early in the 10th. Finally, he was throwing bombs, and connecting. Then  Zaragoza dug a short right hand to Banke's ribs and the challenger faltered.  </P> <P> At that moment, Zaragoza's championship was on the line. He scored with a  combination of his own, and Banke backed off. Zaragoza finished the 10th  strongly. And he won the 11th and 12th rounds, too.  </P> <P> That night, at the end, it was so clear what had happened. A champion in  distress had fought like a champion.  </P> <P> Unhappily, the alphabet-soup guys have cluttered up boxing so much it's too  easy to lose sight of a champion such as Daniel Zaragoza.  </P> <P> Luis Magana has been doing Spanish-language publicity work for Southern  California boxing shows for more than 50 years. Herbert Hoover was president  when Magana started at the Olympic Auditorium.  </P> <P> Last April, he says, promoter Don King asked him to help him with the Los  Angeles Spanish-speaking media for his Julio Cesar Chavez-Roger Mayweather  fight at the Forum.  </P> <P> "I told him I wanted $500 a week, and he agreed," Magana said. "I worked on the  fight for a month. In one stretch, I worked 22 days in a row. After the fight,  he sent me a check for $500 and two tickets in the cheap seats. When I called  to complain, he told me I'd agreed to do it for $500 total.  </P> <P> "I told him there were times during the Depression when I made $100 a week, but  that I'd be a lunatic to offer to work for that today. I turn 80 next year -- I  don't need this."  </P> <P> Al Braverman, a spokesman for King, denied Friday that Magana had been stiffed.  </P> <P> "No such agreement ($500 a week) with Magana was ever made," he said. "Don King  has never stiffed anyone who ever work for him, ever."  </P> <P> Oh? What about Tim Witherspoon, the heavyweight who fought Frank Bruno in  London for, he said, a promised $900,000 from King and later said he wound up  with $90,000?  </P> <P> Boxing Notes  </P> <P> Madison Square Garden's twice-monthly boxing shows are going on the road. The  Garden's Felt Forum, hotbed of New York City boxing since 1969, is closing for  remodeling for two years. In the interim, the Garden will stage its shows at  the Beacon Theater in New York, in Upstate New York and Atlantic City. . . .  Michael Dokes got in the last Felt Forum knockout before the closing, stopping  Wesley Watson in the third round Thursday night. Dokes' manager, Marty Cohen,  met in New York with Don King Wednesday, but the two are said to be $2 million  apart over what Dokes should earn for a Mike Tyson fight. King, meanwhile, said  Friday that two promotional groups in Toronto and one in Edmonton want to  promote a Tyson fight against Canadian Razor Ruddock.  </P> <P> Trump Plaza in Atlantic City says it has the Evander Holyfield-Alex Stewart  heavyweight match but hasn't picked a date yet. Stewart, like Holyfield, is  unbeaten but has stopped all 24 of his opponents. . . . The Normandie  Recreation Center in Los Angeles, 1550 S. Normandie, presents a 10-bout amateur  boxing show Sunday at 2 p.m. NBC's Sunday show: welterweights Buddy McGirt and  Gary Jacobs, replacing Edwin Rosario-Lupe Suarez, after Rosario suffered a hand  injury in training. . . . The United States' amateur team for the World  Championships in Moscow, Sept. 17-Oct. 2, is training at Ft. Huachuca, Ariz. .  . . Official paid attendance for the Michael Nunn-Iran Barkley fight at Reno's  11,000-seat Lawlor Events Center Aug. 14 was 5,453.  </P> <P> The Baldwin Park Hilton Hotel will have an invitational amateur boxing show  Sept. 1-3. . . . Johnny Flores, 73, longtime Southland amateur boxing guru, has  been inducted into the national Golden Gloves Hall of Fame. . . . Roy Jones,  the middleweight thought by many to have been robbed of a gold medal at the  Seoul Olympic Games, tries to move his pro record to 3-0 on an NBC show Sept.  3. . . . Gilberto Roman of Mexico defends his WBC super-flyweight championship  at the Forum Sept. 12 against Santos Laciar of Argentina. . . . Hard-hitting  unbeaten flyweight Michael Carbajal, who has knocked out his last two  opponents, goes next in Tucson Sept. 5.  </P></p>

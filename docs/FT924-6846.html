			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Tunnel vision in Brussels WHEN MR Filippo Maria Pandolfi became European research commissioner four years ago, he inherited in the EC's high definition television (HDTV) policy a costly prestige project which had lost its way. But instead of setting the policy back on track, Mr Pandolfi and his colleagues appear intent on moving it still further in the wrong direction. The HDTV programme was conceived in the mid-1980s chiefly as a means of bolstering Europe's embattled electronics industry. Pioneered in Japan, the technology promised not just to revolutionise home entertainment by bringing cinema-quality pictures to the small screen, but also to trigger a bonanza for makers of television sets, video recorders and advanced electronic components. Urged on by Philips and Thomson, Europe's two main consumer electronics manufacturers, the EC agreed to fund the development of its own HDTV technology and broadcasting standard, HD-Mac. Central to its approach was the belief that gaining supremacy over standards would put the Japanese at a disadvantage by forcing them to compete on a battleground defined by European manufacturers. However, two obstacles have emerged to frustrate the grand strategy. First, European broadcasters have balked at committing themselves to supply services and programmes in an HDTV format while there are still no television sets to receive them. After trying to impose its will on the broadcasters by legislative diktat, Brussels sought to persuade them to make common cause with equipment manufacturers. Both tactics have failed. Different tack The Commission is now trying a different tack. It will today ask telecommunications ministers for authority to spend Ecu850m over five years  -on top of the estimated Ecu1bn in subsidies already invested in HDTV technology - in an effort to win the broadcasters' co-operation. The money would finance production of programmes and studio equipment needed to broadcast wide-screen television services, as a stepping-stone to full HDTV. It is claimed that it could stimulate sales of television sets and video recorders worth Ecu27bn in the next 10 years. But this proposal runs up squarely against the second obstacle. HD-Mac risks being made obsolete by more advanced, fully digital, HDTV systems under development in the US and other parts of Europe. These would make possible still more sophisticated services, carried on more channels using lower-powered transmitters. Some EC officials now admit privately that HD-Mac may never become widely established, while Brussels' public position on the standard has grown steadily more equivocal. Taxpayers' money Even if HD-Mac's future were assured, the case for using taxpayers' money to create a market for it would be highly questionable. But the growing uncertainty over the standard's fate robs the Commission's proposal of any semblance of a coherent rationale. Indeed, the whole HDTV exercise is starting to look like an expensive European champion policy in search of a champion to back. The EC needs to rethink its priorities and recognise that its HDTV policy started from the wrong premise. From the outset, it has been driven chiefly by the interests of equipment manufacturers and their national governments, which saw the programme as a way to create a market sheltered from Japanese competition. Whether broadcasters, programme makers and viewers needed, or were ready to accept, what the producers were determined to provide was at best an after-thought in the formulation of strategy. It is hardly surprising that their response has ranged from indifference to outright hostility. The sensible course for the Community is to abandon its costly dreams of technological hegemony and attempts to massage demand. Instead, it should seek to agree with the US on a common digital standard to be adopted on both sides of the Atlantic. That would not guarantee a rapid take-off for HDTV. But it offers the best hope of creating the mass market needed to bring HDTV out of the laboratory and into millions of living rooms.</p>

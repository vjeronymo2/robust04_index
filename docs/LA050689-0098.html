			<p><P> May 6, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BABY'S PARENTS DEATH SUSPECTS  </P> <P> The parents of a 6-week-old girl whose body was found in a trash barrel in  Missouri are suspects in the death, investigators said Friday.  </P> <P> Robert and Paula Sims had told authorities the baby, Heather, was abducted in  the same manner as another infant daughter three years ago, who also was found  dead.  </P> <P> "The focus of the investigation is now leading to the parents," said Detective  Sgt. Rick McCain of the Alton Police Department. "An arrest is forthcoming," he  said, without indicating exactly when.  </P> <P> A search late Thursday of the couple's home and the home of Paula Sims' mother  produced valuable evidence, McCain said.  </P> <P> Dr. Mary Case, the St. Charles County medical examiner, would not comment on  the cause of death of the infant, found Wednesday night, other than that it was  a homicide.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] A new Palestinian publication in English -- THE  JERUSALEM TIMES -- appeared last weekend. The newspaper adopted  a moderate line and is a champion of the peace process. Our  correspondent in the territories 'Amir Hay visited newspaper  location:    The first issue of THE JERUSALEM TIMES in English was first  disseminated in the territories over the weekend. The weekly  consists of 16 pages, in which the reader will find reports,  articles, and commentaries on current affairs, with an emphasis  on the political process. The publication is designed to become  a daily within a short time. In the first issue, editor Hanna  Sinyurah, who is currently in Spain, chose to emphasize the  details of the Cairo agreement.    On our visit to the weekly's East Jerusalem offices today,  we  were told by several staff members that the publication aims to  boost grass roots support for the political process. [passage  omitted]    One of the things the reader will not find in the new weekly  is, for instance, criticism of 'Arafat's performance in the  negotiations with Israel -- criticism which became more  clamorous in the wake of the Davos summit and the Cairo  agreement, and which has been voiced in the two old-time  dailies, AL-NAHAR and AL-QUDS.    Editors of the new weekly say it is financed by commercial  advertisements, with the PLO extending only ideological support.  'Arafat's opponents say he has prepared himself a new unfledged  newspaper that will give him unreserved support after the  implementation of self-rule.</p>

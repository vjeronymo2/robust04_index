			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Haughey denies phone-tap roleas coalition crisis deepens MR Charles Haughey's position as Irish prime minister, and the future of his coalition government, was left hanging in doubt last night after allegations that he was fully aware in 1982 of an illegal telephone tapping operation. Mr Haughey yesterday denounced the allegations as 'monstrous and unfounded'. The tiny Progressive Democrat (PD) party, whose six parliamentary seats have kept Mr Haughey's government in power since 1989, last night refrained from the feared move of immediately withdrawing from the coalition. But it issued a serious warning and hinted it might still pull out if Mr Haughey were not able to restore quickly the 'credibility and stability of the government'. The PD statement, issued by Mr Des O'Malley, the party leader, is being interpreted as a veiled invitation to the leaders of a growing wave of dissent within Fianna Fail to oust Mr Haughey as leader. If instability in the government continues, the PD party may withdraw from the government after the 1992 budget is passed this month. The phone-tapping accusations were made by Mr Haughey's former justice minister, Mr Sean Doherty, who said on Tuesday night that over several months in 1982 he had personally given Mr Haughey transcripts of the taped conversations of two journalists who were being investigated over cabinet leaks. 'At no stage did (Mr Haughey) indicate disapproval of the action which had been taken,' said Mr Doherty, who resigned yesterday as chairman of the Irish Senate. Opposition leaders yesterday called for Mr Haughey's resignation. Mr Dick Spring, leader of the Labour party, said: 'If Mr Sean Doherty is being truthful, then the prime minister has lied consistently for nine years, to his own cabinet, to his party, to the Dail (parliament) and to the country . . . for the sake of his party and the country, he must be got rid of now.' Mr Haughey said yesterday: 'I wish to categorically state that I was not aware at the time of the tapping of these telephones, and that I was not given and did not see any transcripts of the conversations.' He asked: 'Why should I resign for something someone else has done?' Mr Padraig Flynn, a former environment minister who was sacked by Mr Haughey last November for supporting a backbench leadership putsch against him, said yesterday: 'Fianna Fail cannot hope to improve its position under Mr Haughey's leadership. The issue now is to restore the party's political integ-rity.' Mr Haughey claimed yesterday that Mr Doherty, who lost his cabinet post over the bugging affair, was 'part of a campaign designed to replace me as leader of the Fianna Fail party and (as) prime minister'. He pointed the finger at dissidents within his party who led last November's challenge. Mr Haughey comfortably survived a no-confidence motion at the time, but according to Mr Flynn this was because he had indicated he would withdraw from the leadership once he had completed an immediate work schedule. Yesterday, Mr Haughey said there was 'no time-frame' for his departure. Mr Flynn said 'that statement must be exercising a lot of minds at the moment'.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 26 KYODO -- The Liberal Democratic  Party (LDP) on Tuesday urged the ruling coalition to hand over  power to the opposition camp led by the LDP.    The LDP said in a statement that the ruling parties are to  blame for the current situation of "political anarchy."    The statement, adopted at a meeting of all LDP members in  the  House of Representatives, expressed sympathy with the Social  Democratic Party (SDP), which declared early Tuesday that it is  quitting the coalition.    "The LDP, as a similar parliamentary political party, can  understand the SDP's firm stand to bloc high-handed political  management," the statement said.    Meanwhile, LDP President Yohei Kono told reporters that a  major change has emerged in the coalition, saying "an insincere  act was done to a coalition member."    "Is it okay to entrust the future of the people to such an  insincere government which employs high-handed political  methods? We cannot help but answer 'no'," Kono said.    The LDP joined the opposition camp last August after 38  years  of uninterrupted rule.</p>

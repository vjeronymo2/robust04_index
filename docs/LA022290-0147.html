			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEW;  </P> <P> IT WASN'T MTV, BUT THIS GRAMMYCAST HAD ENERGY  </P> <P> It's always the most performance-oriented of the awards shows, and thus the  truest to its roots. So Wednesday night's Grammycast on CBS rocked.  </P> <P> Mostly.  </P> <P> The MTV revolution has so dramatically altered the way much of America receives  its popular music that live performances at music awards shows inevitably  suffer by comparison with the best of the multimillion-dollar maxi-videos that  continually reach us through TV.  </P> <P> No wonder, then, that some of Wednesday night's live numbers came across as  lower-case music videos, projecting neither the driving physicality and  sweatiness of a live concert nor the precision, climate-controlled cinematic  quality of a studio production. Whatever the impact of some of these  performances on the audience in Shrine Auditorium, no magnetism transferred to  TV. Too much Milli, too much Vanilli.  </P> <P> Yet. . . .  </P> <P> From Billy Joel's energized opening to Bette Midler's energized thank-you  speech for record of the year that closed the evening, there were many more  riffs than raff.  </P> <P> Credit executive producer Pierre Cossette with a good concept and Walter Miller  with crisp direction. Although there were some obvious misfires -- pairing  Olivia Newton-John with Sam Kinison was like pairing Jessica Lange with King  Kong -- the talent blend mostly worked.  </P> <P> A small but memorable moment: Presenters Ella Fitzgerald and Natalie Cole  singing "Straighten Up and Fly Right." A big moment: Lifetime achievement award  recipient Miles Davis working his magic. An eclectic moment: A chorus  collaborating with Mike + the Mechanics on "The Living Years." A soulful  moment: Harolyn Blackwell singing "Summertime."  </P> <P> For sheer electricity, however, nothing topped the tribute to Paul McCartney --  a lovely, lingering interlude on a medium that too infrequently takes the time  to linger.  </P> <P> What inspired choices: Meryl Streep to present McCartney with his lifetime  achievement award, after recalling her worship of the Beatles; Ray Charles, who  inspired a young McCartney, to sing "Eleanor Rigby," and Stevie Wonder to pump  out a moving, stomping, clapping, hothouse, Shrine-shaking rendition of "We Can  Work It Out." Whew!  </P> <P> It wasn't Garry Shandling's show. From his opening monologue, however, host  Shandling was funny ("The updated score is Bonnie Raitt four, the Denver  Broncos nothing," he cracked at one point about four-time winner Raitt) without  being intrusive.  </P> <P> If only he hadn't had such a bad hair night.  </P></p>

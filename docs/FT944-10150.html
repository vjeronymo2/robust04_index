			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Initial Dow rise reversed as bonds turn Wall Street US shares climbed early yesterday on the heels of rising bond prices, before falling into negative territory later on profit-taking and a downturn in the bond market, writes Lisa Bransten in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 9.76 down at 3,821.99. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost 1.03 at 464.37, while the American SE composite shed 1.66 to 449.59 and the Nasdaq composite 2.87 to 764.38. NYSE volume came to 282m shares. The producer price index declined by 0.5 per cent in October, exactly matching September's movement  - most analysts were expecting a 0.1 per cent increase. However, few economists wavered from their forecasts that the Federal Reserve would tighten monetary policy by raising interest rates by at least 50 basis points at next Tuesday's open market committee meeting. Analysts said the positive PPI figure decreased the likelihood that the Fed would make the 100 basis-point increase some had been anticipating. Markets see-sawed for the second consecutive day yesterday following unsteady bond prices. Wednesday's session was volatile amid uncertainties regarding the economic impact of Republican victories in congressional elections. Late in the morning session the Dow had gained nearly 25 points as the 30-year Treasury bond rose, but declined as the long bond lost  3/8 late in the day and the dollar fell to its late Wednesday price against the Japanese yen. Sears Roebuck jumped Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 51 3/8 after the retailer announced its intention to spin off its 80 per cent stake in the insurance subsidiary Allstate next year. Under this plan, Sears' shareholders would receive approximately one share in Allstate for each Sears share presently held. Allstate fell Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 24 1/8 on the news. Shares in US computer-chip makers declined after an industry report, issued late on Wednesday, indicated that sector growth for October was not as strong as many analysts had predicted. Industry bellwether Intel, which is traded on the Nasdaq, dipped Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 61 1/8 , Texas Instruments Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 77 and National Semiconductor Dollars 3/8 to Dollars 17 5/8 . Telefonos de Mexico declined sharply on news that it will face tough competition from a Dollars 1bn joint venture, announced Wednesday, between telecommunications giant AT&amp;T and Mexico's Grupo Industrial Alfa. By the close, Telmex ADRs were down Dollars 4 3/4 at Dollars 51 1/4 . AT&amp;T and Alfa plan to begin operations next year and apply for a licence to provide long-distance service so that it will be ready to compete when that market is opened for full competition in January 1997. Greyhound Lines slipped Dollars  1/16 to Dollars 2 3/16 on news that the beleaguered bus company had rejected a new reorganisation proposal from its bondholders. Caterpillar gained slightly in the morning after announcing on Wednesday that it would increase prices of North American machines and engines, but fell with the rest of the market to end Dollars  3/8 off at Dollars 58. Canada Initial gains were washed away once again, as the weakening in the bond markets sent share prices lower late in the session. The TSE 300 index finished 12.19 down at 4,179.19 in volume of 51.3m shares. Mexico The bolsa registered its fourth biggest fall of 1994 as investors piled out of Telefonos de Mexico (Telmex) after a number of brokers downgraded the issue following AT&amp;T's announcement on Wednesday of a Dollars 1bn joint venture with industrial group Alfa to compete with Telmex in long-distance services. The IPC index closed 126.62 or 4.83 per cent off at 2,492.32. It was dragged down by heavily weighted Telmex, which saw its 'L' shares plummet 8.62 per cent and its 'A' stock drop 8.38 per cent. Brazil Equities in Sao Paulo gained a further 2.2 per cent in moderate trading as sentiment was boosted by a successful share sale by Brazil's National Development Bank (NDB). The Bovespa index ended 1,076 higher at 49,926. Turnover was RDollars 258.5m (Dollars 309.7m). The NDB raised RDollars 91.1m with the sale of minority stakes in 13 companies, up 6.4 per cent from a minimum RDollars 85.6m combined asking price for all stocks.</p>

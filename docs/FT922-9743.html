			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Survey of Machine Tool Industry (3): Germany still top exporter - Orders have improved slightly THESE are tough times for German machine tool manufacturers. As the world's second largest producing country and the largest exporter in the industry, Germany's manufacturers are heavily dependent on the health of the world economy. At the same time, their own domestic market, which totals around DM 11bn a year, has become increasingly attractive to foreign companies. Thus Germany is now also the world's champion importer of machine tools, many of them supplied by Japanese companies which have set up plants in countries like the UK. With two important trade fairs now absorbing the industry's attention - Mach 92 in the UK and Metav 92 in Germany - machine tool makers hope that signs of an upturn from last year's poor performance will gradually emerge. They do not like talk of a crisis. The German machine tool industry association (VDW) is encouraged by the fact that there are slightly more exhibitors at Metav in Dusseldorf (May 5-9) than two years ago. The foreign companies come mainly from Switzerland, the main exporter to the German machine tool market, Italy, Japan, Spain, and France. Attendance at the Meba exhibition in Leipzig, east Germany, this October, also promises to be high. The VDW expects 1992 to be another uninspiring year, but not quite as dismal as 1991 when production fell by 8.4 per cent in real terms to DM15.8bn (Dollars 9.6bn). This gave Germany a share of just over 20 per cent in world output compared with nearly 30 per cent for Japan and 9 per cent for Italy. German machine tool exports were a real 6 per cent lower at DM9.3bn, with imports 2 per cent higher at DM4.7bn. But the real shocker was the order inflow. Last year's incoming new business fell by 23 per cent in real terms to DM14.2bn, with declines of more than 20 per cent in both domestic and foreign business. The nominal fall (excluding price rises) was 19 per cent. The VDW hopes this year's slide can be kept to around 15 per cent, with foreign markets expected to pick up later in the year; it expects a further 18 per cent nominal drop in domestic orders, but a milder decline of 9 per cent from abroad. IT is also marginally more optimistic on production, foreseeing a real drop of around 7 per cent in 1992. Its forecasts were drawn up with the help of the Ifo economic research institute in Munich. Mr Gerhard Hein, an economist with VDW, points out that the figures for last year were not actually as bad as they appeared, especially on the order side. Suffering most were the producers of standard machine tools who experienced collapses of 30 per cent or more in orders. But makers of special tools such as those used to grind metal and make gears, and of automated production systems for the car, aerospace and other industries, fared less poorly. The average order backlog in the industry had dropped to 6.6 months at the start of this year from an average of 7.8 months in 1991; for standard machines, the figure was a much more depressing four months. In past years, downturns in one part of the world could usually be made up somewhere else. But weak demand in the western industrialised countries has combined with the slump in the former Soviet and eastern European economies to cause a drop in business on all sides for German producers. Last year, the Soviet Union was actually the biggest market for German machine tools, but this reflected earlier orders. Today, says Mr Hein, 'business with the countries of the former Soviet Union is dead and there is no future perspective'. Of the near DM1.2bn of Soviet business in 1991, roughly two-thirds was attributable to exports by west German companies and a third to those in east Germany whose economy has suffered badly from the Comecon trading bloc's collapse. However, even without the east German contribution, the Soviet Union has been traditionally an important market. In 1988 and 1989, it was the biggest customer for west German machine tools ahead of France, the US, and Italy. Thus the virtual disappearance of this market, at last for a time, is a serious matter for German producers. While there is obviously a great potential demand for imported machine tools to help in economic reconstruction, financing is a critical problem. German companies have a further difficulty: because of the Bonn government's firm approach to the sale abroad of products that could be used for military purposes, exports of some German goods have been held up. The government's list of sensitive countries for which exports have to go through a special approval process covered some 15 per cent of foreign sales, though this has been modified. This strict policy towards so-called 'dual-use' products can cause costly delays - 'lots of firms say officials don't realise that the competition is ready to jump in and profit from any delivery delays,' says Mr Hein. 'Around 60 per cent of (the machine tool industry's) turnover consists of exports, so it's a serious problem.' In the domestic market, west German producers have benefitted partly from the economic upsurge caused by re-unification and the need to reconstruct east Germany. So far, however, it has been mainly the car and other consumer industries that have felt the post-unity impulses. Since statistics on internal German trade in this area are sketchy - some orders placed by west German customers are for use in the east - Mr Hein regards this figure as a minimum. It shows, Mr Hein says, that the west German industry is close to achieving again the DM500m or so of annual sales which were transacted with the former East Germany in 1989, its last full year of existence. But economic progress is proving painfully slow in Germany's new eastern states. It is to the important markets of western Europe and the US, therefore, that machine tool producers are mainly looking for signs of an end to the malaise.</p>

			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Security Council takes harder line President Saddam Hussein's aggressive troop deployment in southern Iraq has 'changed the environment' within the United Nations Security Council and suffocated previous support from France and Russia for early moves towards an easing of sanctions, diplomats in New York said yesterday. The diplomats described the deployment as a 'foolish' and 'failed' attempt to bully the Security Council which, they said, would only postpone any consideration of easing the economically crippling four-year-old oil embargo. 'The Council cannot accept to be threatened,' said one official. 'This has been very counter-productive for the Iraqis.' Security Council members are today due to receive a report from Mr Rolf Ekeus, UN special envoy, on the readiness of monitoring systems to ensure Iraqi compliance with a post Gulf war ban on developing weapons of mass destruction. The report is expected to say the systems are in place and that a test period can begin. Last week Iraqi officials issued an ultimatum, apparently backed up by the past few days' show of military muscle near the Kuwaiti border, threatening unspecified 'measures' should the Security Council not act immediately on Mr Ekeus's report and move towards easing sanctions. However, diplomats said that while the Security Council is likely to consider the report at a meeting tomorrow or Thursday, it is not expected to issue more than an acknowledgment that the weapons monitoring systems are 'provisionally operational'. As a western official said: 'I don't know what Saddam is waiting for, but he's not going to get anything out of the Security Council.' France and Russia, along with China, had previously said they backed offering Iraq a definite six-month monitoring test period which, if Iraq complied, they said should lead to a full Security Council discussion on easing sanctions. Britain and the US opposed giving Iraq such concrete criteria for the lifting of sanctions. Yesterday, however, diplomats said the Iraqi troop movements had reversed these diplomatic gains. 'All the environment has changed,' said one. 'And we cannot expect the council to take any positive action on the Ekeus report.'</p>

			<p><P> July 31, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> Broad Inc.: The Los Angeles-based financial services company reported net  income of $10.7 million for its third quarter ended June 30, up 17% from $9.2  million a year ago.  </P> <P> Net operating income (before net realized investment losses) rose 63% in the  quarter to $15.8 million from $9.6 million. Chief Executive Eli Broad  attributed the operating gain to a higher level of assets under management  following the firm's acquisition of the core financial services businesses of  Integrated Resources in January. However, the company also is experiencing a  modestly higher level of net realized investment losses than anticipated  earlier, he said.  </P></p>

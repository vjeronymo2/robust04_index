			<p>BFN     [Text] The South African National Defense Force [SANDF]  says it is not in a position to handle peace-keeping operations  outside the borders of South Africa. The defense force said  that a decision to deploy the SANDF outside South Africa was a  political one, to be taken by the government of national unity.  However, several practical implications would have to  considered. These included the strain on manpower, logistics,  and funds caused by the integration of about 30,000 people into  the force. Moreover, the legal aspects would have to be  resolved before there could be any involvement in a major role  beyond the borders. The SANDF was reacting to speculation about  the possible role of the force in operations outside South  Africa.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The ``grandfathering'' provisions of &sect;85.1403(d)(3) allow operators having urban buses equipped with upgrade kits installed prior to January 1, 1995 to assume that such urban buses are operating at the PM level of the upgraded engine configuration. Further, EPA believes it is reasonable to extend the ``grandfathering'' provisions beyond January 1, 1995 for use of the DDC upgrade kit until appropriate equipment is certified, as discussed below, for the DDC 6V92TA engines. Operators, however, should note that ``grandfathering'' provisions do not require either the emissions defect or emissions performance warranties which are required of certified equipment under &sect;85.1409 of the program regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, permission to retrofit/rebuild with uncertified equipment to meet program requirements applies to a limited population of engines (that is, the 1979 through 1989 model year 6V92TA engines having mechanical fuel injection) for a limited time frame (the 1995 and 1996 calendar years). If equipment is certified for the above-referenced DDC engines as achieving the required PM emission reductions for less than the applicable cost ceiling before July 1, 1996, operators will not be able to claim emission reductions for engines rebuilt after calendar years 1995 and 1996 using uncertified equipment. Operators will be able to continue to claim emission reductions for engines which are rebuilt with the uncertified DDC upgrade kit prior to that time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Ann Goode,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;21779 Filed 9&hyph;1&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;P <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

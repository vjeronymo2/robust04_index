			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Marcio Moreira Alves: "Motives for Alliances"] </F>   [Text] Lula is proposing an electoral pact directly with  the PDT [Brazilian Labor Party] in opposition to the interests  of party leader Leonel Brizola, whose elevation to the  presidency is the only reason for the PDT's existence. Does Lula  think it is possible to be successful? Obviously not. He is  simply building a bridge to the second round of balloting with  the intention of collecting his rival's votes without having to  negotiate directly with that rival. The leftist leanings that he  detects in Brizola's voters would naturally gravitate toward him.    The law of gravity is also preferred by social democrats  who,  like Mario Covas, feel nauseated at the thought of possible  alliances with groups further to the right, examples being the  PFL [Liberal Front Party], the PP [Progressive Party], and the  PTB [Brazilian Labor Party]. They believe that those votes,  lacking an alternative, will naturally trickle over to Fernando  Henrique.    What must be has great strength, as they say in Minas  Gerais,  where it is also said that there are three forces against which  man can do nothing: fire moving uphill, water moving downhill,  and the Federal Government. So if electoral support is  inevitable and the PSDB has the Federal Government's official  candidate, why expend so much time and energy on a  behind-the-scenes battle of the "hold me back or I'll hit him"  variety?    That is the question being asked by the pragmatists. The  question being asked by the scientists is different: in a  country where, according to a list published by Wanderley  Guilherme in his book Regresso (Return), 23.7 percent  of the congressmen--representing 51 percent of the voters--have  changed parties since the Constituent Assembly of 1988, why  waste time with party leadership bodies? To take only one  example, the PP was established on 31 January 1993 and has 37  federal deputies and four senators, all of them "migrants."  Added to that is the fact that, as Maria D'Alva Kinzo wrote in  Radiografia do Quadro Partidario Brasileiro (X-Ray of the  Brazilian Party Situation), half of the voters have no  preference for any party at all, and when it comes to those who  do have a preference, only the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic  Movement Party] (19.4 percent) and the PT [Workers Party] (13.6  percent) have a significant membership. If that is the case, why  not attempt a direct dialogue with the voters?    The isolationists, who oppose any and all alliances and who  account for 35 percent of Fernando Henrique's voters in Sao  Paulo, add another question: if 70 percent of the congressmen  are going to be rejected by the voters in October (and the  percentage is expected to be even higher in the Northeast), what  kind of argument exists for an alliance with the PFL, 52 percent  of whose congressional bloc is from the Northeast and will  therefore be the most probable victim of that rejection?    The reasons for electoral nuptials, no matter how  preposterous they may seem to the ideologically sensitive, are  purely objective. In the first place, there is the question of  geographical presence. Even though they have few members, the  biggest parties have established good structures at the  municipal level. In the 1992 elections, the PFL elected nearly  1,000 mayors. The PSDB elected only 332, although five of those  are in state capitals. The PTB, which supports the government as  strongly as the PFL, elected 79 state deputies, a reasonable  number. Miniparties such as the PDC [Christian Democratic  Party], the PL [Liberal Party], the PRN [National Reconstruction  Party], and so on, which are the next objective in alliances,  elected 23 percent of the mayors in the North, 24 percent in the  Northeast, 27 percent in the Center-West, 16 percent in the  Southeast, and 10 percent in the South.    "Going it alone doesn't work," say almost all the party  leaders. The main reason is not the need for mayors to shove the  voters to the ballot box. It is the magic of television.  Everybody recognizes the crucial role played by the TSE's  [Superior Electoral Court's] free campaign programs in  influencing decisions by the voters. Since the allotment of air  time--already set by the electoral court--is in proportion to  the number of congressmen in each party, alliances will decide  which candidates have the most opportunities to present their  platforms. Isolated candidates like Brizola and also Espiridiao  Amin, if he accepts the challenge, will have to summarize their  messages tremendously and run the risk of not imprinting them in  the minds of the voters.</p>

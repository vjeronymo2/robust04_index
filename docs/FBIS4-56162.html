			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dora Kramer: "The Men Whom Cardoso Would Take to </F> Planalto Palace"]    [Text] Brasilia -- Fernando Henrique Cardoso [FHC] likes to  say that no one speaks for him. He is also in the habit of never  telling everything he knows or thinks to everybody. He says a  little bit to each one and keeps for himself the prerogative of  putting facts together and forming convictions. But he cannot do  without the cooperation of a select group of individuals whose  power to influence him varies according to their area of  activity, degree of friendship, and competence. There are the  professionals, the politicians, the intellectuals, and the  friends.    A place as special as it is discreet is that occupied by his  wife, Ruth Cardoso. Those who are on close terms with FHC are of  the opinion that if he won the election, she would be much more  than the First Lady. "Ruth is a very good thinker, and Fernando  listens to her more than people can imagine," says his friend  Sergio Mota, secretary general of the PSDB [Brazilian Social  Democracy Party] and a member of the group that combines  friendship and politics. Another such member is Deputy Jose  Serra, a friend from before 1964 and a companion in exile who,  he says, is unfairly pointed to as a surreptitious opponent of  FHC.    The loyalty invoked by Serra is the feature common to the  three advisers currently regarded as the most important people  in Fernando Henrique's day-to-day political life. They are press  adviser Ana Tavares, special adviser Eduardo Jorge, and combined  congressional adviser and ghost writer Eduardo Graeff. They will  be important figures in the campaign, and if Fernando Henrique  is elected, they will occupy a privileged place in Planalto  Palace.    FHC also has supporters outside Brasilia. One of them is  Francisco Graziano, chief of the candidate's Sao Paulo office.  And in the field of ideas, he has philosopher Jose Arthur  Giannotti of the USP [University of Sao Paulo] at his side. Some  people also point to former Deputy Jose Gregori, now chef de  cabinet to Marcilio Marques Moreira, as being one of his very  close friends.    A bright star in the political category is Tasso Jereissati,  although Fernando Henrique now regards Senator Mario Covas as  one of the most loyal and honorable party members on his side.  Here we present a short profile of some of Fernando Henrique's  faithful companions.  <H5>  Sergio Mota: Close Friend, Indispensable Adviser </H5>   In the group that combines friendship and politics, Mota,  Cardoso, and Federal Deputy Jose Serra form an inseparable trio.  Sergio Mota is an engineer who engaged in student politics as a  member of Popular Action (AP) during the years of repression. He  owns a business in Sao Paulo, was president of Eletropaulo (the  electric company in Sao Paulo) when Franco Montoro (PMDB  [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party]) was governor, and is such  a close friend of Fernando Henrique Cardoso that they own a  ranch together in Minas Gerais.    At crucial moments, such as the time when it was decided  that  the PSDB would join Fernando Collor's administration in 1992, or  during party crises, or now, as Cardoso leaves the Ministry of  Finance, Sergio Mota lands in Brasilia and works at party  headquarters -- he is secretary general -- or in Congress. But  he is on the telephone with Fernando Henrique several times a  day.    There are those who say that Sergio Mota will run for  federal  deputy, but he himself evades the issue: "I enjoy party  politics; I have been involved in it since I was a student," he  says, but does not explain whether or not he is going to move up  to the front line in politics. In one way or another, he is  already there. As secretary general of the PSDB, he takes part  in all party decisions and is active on several fronts.  <H5>  Eduardo Graeff: Most Prestigious PSDB Writer </H5>   The one who describes him exactly is Jose Serra the  sociologist: "If there was an Eduardo pill, I would take it."  The reason is that the congressional adviser to the former  minister of finance, who has now gone on the campaign trail, is  one of the most highly praised members of Fernando Henrique's  staff. Chiefly because of his writing, which, according to PSDB  members in general, borders on perfection. He is the one behind  almost everything that leaves the PSDB and its environs in  written form: speeches, articles, documents, and even technical  texts. Provisional Measure 434, which created the URV [real unit  of value], owed a great deal to Eduardo, who is very much in  demand as a speechwriter by the party's bloc in Congress.    As congressional adviser, he functioned as Fernando  Henrique's point man with Congress, where he spends the entire  day talking on his cellular telephone. He has been part of the  group for over 10 years, and because of his duties as a writer,  he is considered to be one of those most familiar with what  Fernando Henrique is thinking.  <H5>  Jose Serra: Not-Always-Peaceful Friendship </H5>   Considering everything that is said, it is surprising that  Serra should be on this list. But there is no one in the group  who does not say he is one of Fernando Henrique's closest and  most influential friends. The two of them have followed a common  path that began before 1964, when the deputy was president of  the National Union of Students in Sao Paulo, continued in exile  abroad, and is now being strengthened in post-amnesty politics.    But the surprise some people feel at Serra's presence in the  group is the result of two facts. First, there is the story that  has always made Serra out to be a candidate for the Ministry of  Finance. Second, there is the fact that relations between the  two are not always peaceful. A typical love-hate relationship,  according to some. It is true that they quarrel and that they  frequently disagree -- especially since Fernando Henrique is the  king of tolerance and Serra the emperor of impatience -- but  there is no important decision in FHC's life in which Serra does  not participate.  <H5>  Ana Tavares: Adviser Who Also Knows the Political Game </H5>   Ana is the daughter of journalist Tavares de Miranda, who  was  FOLHA DE SAO PAULO's society columnist for years, and that may  explain why she has so much mobility in her duties as press  adviser -- duties that end up slipping into the giving of  personal and political advice. She receives about 80 telephone  calls per day, and it is not rare for her to have to write 12  exclusive memos for 12 different political columns. Ana likes to  stay home to read and talk on the telephone. Before 0900, she is  already at work in her office. Unobtrusive even in the way she  dresses -- always skirt and blouse, low moccasins, black hair  combed back and sometimes held in place by red-framed glasses --  Ana Tavares is so discreet as to be mysterious. Out of respect  for such a reserved manner, not even her closest friends ask her  how old she is. Nonsense: she says straight out that she is past  40. But that is as far as she will go, since she is absolutely  against the idea of coming out of the shadows. "An adviser has  to stay in the background" is her motto. Ana does her work,  which goes far beyond that simply of a press adviser. "When I  want some information and cannot get through to Fernando  Henrique, I turn to her, and she always has something to say,"  says Alberico de Souza Cruz, director of journalism for the  Globo Network.  <H5>  Eduardo Jorge: Discreet `Lightning Rod' for Entire Team </H5>   An expert on public administration, Eduardo Jorge is  considered to be Fernando Henrique's alter ego. Like Ana  Tavares, he has a horror of being in the spotlight and, if  questioned, greatly downplays his own importance to the  candidate: "Here I am just an adviser." Modesty. He is the man  that FHC puts in charge of special missions, and he is called  the team's "lightning rod." His missions are so special and  secret that there is no record of them for history. There is  only the testimony of the other members of the group, who  suddenly turn forgetful.    Eduardo is an international consultant in the legislative  area. He was educated abroad and has worked as director of the  Senate Data Processing Center (Prodasen), which he helped  organize. Both in the Senate and in the Ministries of Foreign  Affairs and Finance, Eduardo Jorge's office has always been just  a couple of meters away from Fernando Henrique's.  <H5>  Tasso Jereissati: Key Man in Setting up Alliances </H5>   A new friend but one always close to Fernando Henrique at  crucial moments. In the two weeks before FHC's candidacy was  announced, he was put in charge of contacts. It was he who  worked hardest to get the PT [Workers Party] to ally itself with  the PSDB. Now he is talking to Minas Gerais Governor Helio  Garcia of the PTB [Brazilian Labor Party] and to the president  of the PP [Progressive Party], Alvaro Dias. His point men in the  PFL [Liberal Front Party] are Antonio Carlos Magalhaes and the  party president, Jorge Bornhausen. Tasso, who is also in charge  of the communications area, was recently in Rio de Janeiro to  talk to Roberto Marinho, owner of the Globo Organizations. Until  the end of May, which is the deadline for holding party  conventions, he will be the key man in setting up alliances.  Twice considered for a cabinet post (in the Sarney and Collor  administrations), he is said to be a shoo-in for a first-echelon  position if Fernando Henrique reaches Planalto Palace.</p>

			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Cook in attack on trade policy LABOUR HAS lashed out at the government's export insurance regime, charging it with 'profiteering' from exporters and threatening Britain's prospects for recovery. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, released figures which he said showed that the government hoped to make a 'tidy' profit of Pounds 129m from exporters in the next three years. Accusing the government of 'sheer stupidity', he urged ministers to act to ensure British exporters were not faced with higher insurance premiums than their foreign competitors. 'Michael Heseltine (the trade and industry secretary) is keen to talk about creating a level playing field,' he said. 'From where our exporters are standing, it looks more like the north face of the Eiger.' The figures released by Mr Cook were presented as a budget analysis for the UK's Export Credits Guarantee Department. They showed net public expenditure by the ECGD was expected to be negative in each of the next three financial years, weighing in at minus Pounds 35m in 1993-94, minus Pounds 64m in 1994-95 and minus Pounds 30m in 1996-97. Mr Cook said this would be the first time this had happened since records began. Labour's attack came about 10 days after a group of leading British exporters warned MPs that the high cost and limited availability of export credit cover was putting thousands of British jobs at risk and causing hundreds of millions of pounds in exports to be lost. Mr Brian Willett, ECGD chief executive, said last month that the organisation was likely 'in three to four years' to become a net contributor to the exchequer for the first time in about a decade. The exporters' group called for ECGD country coverage comparable with that of competitors, for premium rates to be harmonised with those of competitor countries and for the government to provide aid-supported finance where competitor countries provided it.</p>

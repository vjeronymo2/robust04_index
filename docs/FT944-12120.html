			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / US Mid-Term Elections (November 8): A year of divided loyalties - Rarely have there been quite so many endorsements departing from political norms This is the season of falling leaves, struggling candidacies and the frantic search for political endorsements. Rarely, however, have there been quite so many striking endorsements which depart from political norms. The big questions are whether this year's batch will make a difference in key races, the extent to which they have been dictated by local circumstances and candidacies and, since the majority of endorsements have been of Democrats by prominent moderate Republicans, if there is a revolt brewing against the opposition's dominant right-wing. Mr Ross Perot, who admits to no party allegiance, joined the parade on Tuesday by coming out for Ms Ann Richards, the Democratic governor of Texas whose re-election struggle against Mr George W Bush Jr, son of the former president, is too close to call. The immediate interpretation of the Texas billionaire's endorsement is that it was a further manifestation of his animus for the Bush family so evident in the 1992 presidential election and since exacerbated by some acid comments in Mrs Barbara Bush's memoirs. Mr Perot, whose political organisation, United We Stand, has not been a coherent force this election year, has generally urged a vote for Republicans in the November 8 mid-term elections and most of his supporters are identified with conservative positions. So he will spend this weekend campaigning in Washington state for the opponent of Mr Tom Foley, Democratic Speaker of the House. But he has also endorsed the re-election of Mr Roy Rohmer, the Democratic governor of Colorado. Other endorsements to catch the eye include the Republican mayors of New York and Los Angeles backing the Democratic candidates for governor and the Senate respectively, though, in California, Mayor Richard Riordan also came out for Governor Pete Wilson, the Republican incumbent. Virginia has seen the most conspicuous variation on the theme with Republican stalwarts from the Reagan and Bush administrations, joined by Mrs Nancy Reagan, condemning Mr Oliver North, the Republican Senate candidate. The conspicuous exception has been Mr James Baker, former secretary of the treasury and state departments, who may be eyeing a presidential run of his own in 1996. Mr Jack Kemp and Mr Bill Bennett, cabinet secretaries under President Bush, came out sharply against the Californian proposition that would deny social services to illegal immigrants. This was in spite of the fact that Governor Wilson has made support for the initiative a centrepiece of his campaign. Opposition to hard-right candidates has also surfaced from well-known local Republicans in Minnesota, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Iowa. But a contrary trend is observed in some newspaper editorials, with the Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times, both generally liberal in outlook, coming out, respectively, for Republicans as mayor of the nation's capital and for governor of California. Conservative candidates have also been endorsed by powerful lobbies. The National Rifle Association, for example, is seeking its revenge on those in Congress who supported gun control. The impact of endorsements has been varied. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's backing seems to have helped turn New York Governor Mario Cuomo's campaign around. When it came early last week, he was behind Mr George Pataki, the Republican, but polls out in the last 24 hours put him 12-18 points ahead. There is no polling measure yet of Mr Riordan's Sunday support for Senator Dianne Feinstein, holding a slim lead over Congressman Michael Huffington, but it certainly cannot harm her in southern California, where she is weakest. Governor Wilson now holds a solid lead over Ms Kathleen Brown, even though support for the anti-immigrant proposition, still likely to pass, has been falling. Both mayors argued the toss that Mr Huffington and Mr Pataki, if elected, could not be relied on to help their cities. Mr Giuliani was also motivated by dislike of Senator Al D'Amato, the New York Republican who is Mr Pataki's patron. A Texas poll yesterday gave Governor Richards a small three-point lead over Mr Bush, but it was taken before Mr Perot's endorsement. In Virginia, diehard supporters of Mr North, in a virtual dead heat with Senator Charles Robb, seem impervious to advice from Republican grandees. In Michigan, Governor John Engler is on a cakewalk to re-election. In Washington, DC, few think the Post's endorsement of Mrs Carol Schwartz can prevent the return to city hall of Mr Marion Barry, a prospect which so horrifies residents of the city's only predominantly white ward that a semi-serious movement has been launched to secede to Maryland. More broadly, Democrats have taken some heart from Republican ideological divisions, with President Bill Clinton himself doing his best this week to play them up in the company of Democratic candidates who once spurned him. But, mostly, it is the Democrats who are on the defensive and the Republicans who are more likely to vote.</p>

			<p><P> March 17, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PAST IS PROBED AS FUTURE LOOMS;  </P> <P> ARCHEOLOGY HAS ITS DAY WHILE IRVINE COAST AWAITS BULLDOZERS  </P> <P> While its future may hold resort hotels and designer homes with ocean vistas,  life on the Irvine Coast thousands of years ago was anything but glamorous,  according to local archeologists.  </P> <P> Imagine living in a rock cave with nothing for warmth but a small fire and a  bear skin. Imagine fishing for dinner in a stormy winter ocean and cooking the  catch to serve with berries gathered by family members.  </P> <P> Scenes such as these probably characterized life on the Irvine Coast about  3,000 years ago, said Michael Macko, director of archeology for the Costa  Mesa-based Keith Cos.  </P> <P> Macko and a staff of 35 archeologists, field workers and students have been  surveying the 9,234 acres of unincorporated Irvine Coast area where the Irvine  Co. plans to develop 2,600 housing units, 3 hotels and 2 golf courses. There  also will be a Sheriff's Department substation, a fire station, a library and a  child-care facility in the area, an Irvine Co. spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> The Irvine Co. finally won approval from the County Board of Supervisors to  develop the area between Corona del Mar and Laguna Beach last year, after a  compromise was reached in a battle of more than 20 years with environmental and  community groups opposed to development. The company gained approval for the  project after several plan changes, the last of which was designed to leave as  much open space as possible in the county's only remaining undeveloped expanse  of coastline.  </P> <P> </P> <P> $5-Million, 3-Year Project  </P> <P> To meet the requirements of the project's environmental impact report, the  Irvine Co. hired archeologists to study the area and ensure that much of the  area's archeological information would be preserved for study after  development, Macko said. The most interesting findings will be displayed at  Irvine's Museum of Natural History. Others will be stored in the museum's  warehouse for possible study by future archeologists, he said.  </P> <P> The Irvine Co. plans to spend $5 million on the 3-year project, which Macko  said he hopes will be "the most in-depth history of Orange County ever taken."  </P> <P> While those in the field haven't yet discovered "Irvine Man," Macko said, some  of their finds are estimated to be as many as 5,000 years old. Among the items  on display in a special showing Thursday were primitive tools, arrowheads and  spearheads, and crude beads. Radiocarbon dating was used to determine the age  of the artifacts, he said.  </P> <P> "What we see at this time period is a very accomplished people," Macko said of  those who must have used the artifacts. Though archeologists believe that they  were nomadic, studies of the artifacts that surrounded their dwellings indicate  that they were also sophisticated mariners and hunters, he said.  </P> <P> The remains of two humans, believed to be of early Indian tribes that inhabited  the area more than 800 years ago, also were found, Macko said. They were moved  to an undisclosed burial area at the recommendation of an Indian consultant, he  said.  </P> <P> So far, Macko said, there are 90 archeological sites on the Irvine Coast; of  those, 67 are being preserved by the state as wildlife reserves or park areas.  </P> <P> The remaining 23 sites are being studied by archeologists, and since the  project began in March of last year, they have excavated nine of the sites.  Within the next year, they will complete the remaining sites, and the final  year will be used to study their findings, Macko said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Computer Aids Search  </P> <P> From an on-site field office, Macko is refining a computer-assisted technique  that enables him to project which of the sites will contain the most material  of archeological importance. By surveying predetermined amounts of surface soil  from several areas on a site and entering findings into a computer, Macko said  he has been successful in determining which areas will contain the richest  deposits of archeological information.  </P> <P> Employees also work from the office to label and catalogue excavation findings,  Macko said.  </P> <P> And while their work would not compare to the elaborate Lascaux cave paintings  in Southern France, the people who inhabited the miles of hilly coastal area  between today's Corona del Mar and Laguna Beach did dabble in the arts,  archeologists said.  </P> <P> Assorted shapes and sizes of stones that were on display at the museum Thursday  were decorated with indecipherable etchings. Archeologists said they believe  that these were attempts at art by the early coastal dwellers.  </P> <P> "They are not considered unique or priceless in their own right," Macko said.  "But they are valuable historically."  </P></p>

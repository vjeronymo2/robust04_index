			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Invergordon The deal between Fleming Investment Management and Whyte &amp; Mackay may demonstrate that Chinese walls can operate effectively, but Invergordon's management will not draw much comfort from that. Having fought off a bid from Whyte two years ago with the aid of Robert Fleming merchant bank, Invergordon was always at risk. But for the company's independence to be carried off by a combination of the oversupply in the whisky market and the investment performance demands of one of Robert Fleming's close associates is a hard fate. Presumably it is also mildly embarrassing for Fleming, and any future explanations of the benefits of integrated houses to potential clients will make interesting listening. Still, for all that, the takeover makes sense. Invergordon's strength in whisky distilling and own label scotch naturally complement Whyte and Mackay's mid-market brands and bottling capacity. Since Invergordon is a fairly spare organisation and there is little overlap between the two companies, rationalisation benefits will be small. But the two combined should be able to manage a more effective marketing effort than either singly. Whyte has also timed its intervention well. Over time Invergordon should prove good value to Whyte, provided it manages its acquisition well. Given that the bid is effectively decided, it would be in the interests of the business for Invergordon's directors to use whatever influence they have left to bring the agony to an end quickly.</p>

			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Serbs pull out of talks with Croatia SERBIA, under President Slobodan Milosevic, yesterday intensified its confrontation with the Yugoslav federal government by trying to scupper peace talks between the Yugoslav authorities and Croatia. Serbia withdrew from talks in Zagreb, the Croatian capital, on the re-establishment of economic relations and transport, and the return of Croatian refugees to United Nations protected zones in Serb-held areas of Croatia. A Serbian government statement accused the Yugoslav government, under Prime Minister Milan Panic, of betraying Croatia's Serb minority by negotiating with Croatia. However, the federal government last night criticised the Serbian administration, saying 'only negotiations, and not cannons, will bring back dignity and freedom to the Serbs outside Serbia'. In an apparent reference to Mr Milosevic, it said: 'The people who brought us to a desperate position before the international community have no moral right to undermine moves towards peace by the Yugoslav government and president.' The conflict between Mr Milosevic, on one side, and Mr Panic and Mr Dobrica Cosic, the Yugoslav president, is set to sharpen further after last Sunday's referendum failed to win a vote in favour of early elections. Unofficial results yesterday showed the vote to be less than the required 50 per cent majority. Hopes for the demilitarisation of Sarajevo also foundered yesterday when Bosnian leaders pulled out of UN-sponsored talks. They accused Bosnian Serbs of stopping the repair of water and power in the Bosnian capital, which has been besieged for six months by Serb fighters. In northern Bosnia, Serb commanders said they had re-opened the land corridor for traffic between Serbia and Bosnia's Serb-held territories amid heavy fighting. However, in a conflicting report, Croatian radio claimed Croat forces had blocked the corridor west of Brcko, in north-eastern Bosnia. Reuter adds from London: Three European officials investigating atrocities against civilians in former Yugoslavia said Serbs seemed mainly to blame and thought there were legal grounds for prosecution. A draft report by officials appointed on British initiative under the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, recommended a committee of experts should work out a treaty creating a war crimes tribunal.</p>

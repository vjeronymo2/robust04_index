			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Sappi Sappi's Dollars 1.6bn acquisition of Scott's coated paper subsidiary, SD Warren, is the largest US transaction struck by a South African company. Such deals will proliferate as compatriot companies take advantage of their country's international rehabilitation to reduce dependence on the domestic market. Given the recent inexperience of South African groups, Sappi's strategy, the price it paid and its ability to reduce debt require special scrutiny. The strategy looks valid; Sappi will now be world leader in coated paper, the industry's fastest growing segment. The price, at 15 times historic earnings, is no steal, but at a small discount to net asset value looks reasonable. As for debt, Sappi could be accused of recklessness in taking on such large sums so late in the US cycle. However, cash flow prospects are promising. The coated sector, plagued by overcapacity, has lagged other paper grades, but US prices bottomed in July, and since then two increases have been announced and achieved. Little additional capacity is under construction to undermine further rises. With the prospect of volume growth, escalating prices, and the promise of further cost savings, Sappi should quickly reduce its debt burden. While Sappi may celebrate, for Arjo Wiggins Appleton the South Africans' success is a setback. The Franco-British group had made no secret of its desire to acquire elements of SD Warren. Yet again, financial constraints or lack of nerve has held back the group's industrial progress. Restraint can be a strength, but timidity is a serious management weakness.</p>

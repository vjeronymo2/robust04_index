			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev -- On 19 April Ukraine President Leonid  Kravchuk attended the opening of a new outpatient child clinic  in Kharkovskiy district intended for 30,000 local children.    The Ukrainian president was interviewed on current political  issues. He said, in particular, that the Black Sea Fleet  problem must be resolved as soon as possible. "We need to settle  it as soon as possible, so that instead of a Russian fleet with  Russia's laws, Ukraine will have its own fleet. I do not see  any other option than leasing the Sevastopol base to the Russian  fleet. Leaving the Ukrainian Navy there would be dangerous.  There will be no peace as long as the Ukrainian and Russian  naval forces are together."    Asked about his nomination in the next presidential election  by a group of electors in Vinnitsa oblast, Leonid Kravchuk  replied: "I am grateful to the voters. I have very close ties  with Vinnitsa oblast; I was nominated and elected to parliament  in Yampolskiy constituency there, and when I was nominated for  presidency they also supported me, so I am sincerely grateful."</p>

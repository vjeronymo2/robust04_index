The recent chart depicting the  economic trends in different countries prepared by the World  Bank and the Asian Development Bank indicates that no noteworthy  progress has been made in the economy of Bangladesh. Rather,  the situation has worsened in certain sectors.    It is unfortunate that the flow of foreign investment to  this  country is still very insignificant. Between 1986 and 1991,  foreign investment worth $1.338 billion were made in India and  $1.131 billion in Pakistan. In Sri Lanka, total foreign  investment in this period totalled $297 million. During this  period, foreign investment worth only $11 million dollars was  made in Bangladesh. Other than clothing-related industries, no  other industrial units were set up in the country during this  five-year span. On the other hand, 3,000 plants were declared  sick and subsequently closed.    The industrial growth rate in Bangladesh during the past few  years has been estimated at 5 percent. In other poor countries  of Asia, the rate was between 7 and 8 percent. In 1970 the  contribution of investment to the Bangladeshi GDP was 11  percent, but in 1990 it went down to 10 percent.    The contribution of the manufacturing sector to the GDP is  20  percent in India, 24 percent in Thailand, and 16 percent in  Pakistan. In Bangladesh it is only 9 percent. Apart from the  poor industrial growth, losses in the industrial sector have  become routine. In 1992, industrial units in the nationalized  sector incurred losses amounting to 20 billion taka. The losses  suffered by the industrial sector are partly responsible for the  slow growth in direct foreign investment. This discourages  foreign investors and impedes development. We are not only  unable to attract overseas investors, but have also failed to  protect the interests of foreign companies already operating in  the country. Several foreign companies including Philips,  Glaxo, Bangladesh Tobacco Company, ICI, and Dhaka Match Company  have already concluded their business and left the country.    Business circles have expressed dissatisfaction over the  privatization move initiated by the government. They say that  since the time of the Ershad government, it has been said that  the Telephone and Telegraph Board will be converted into a  holding company. So far the government has failed to do so due  to threats by the workers' union. During the past three years,  the government has failed to privatize even one large industrial  unit from the nationalized sector. About a year ago, the state  minister for textiles, Abdul Mannan, announced that 60 to 70  billion taka would be spent to set up about 1,000 industrial  units in the textile sector. Nothing has been done so far. It  has been learned that the government has not yet approved the  proposal by the minister for the development of the textile  sector.    The government says that foreign investors are discouraged  by  the frequent strike calls. Foreigners believe that the  deteriorating law and order situation and a weak administration  are particularly responsible for scaring investors away. A  similar sentiment was also expressed by Mr. Milam, the former  U.S. ambassador to Bangladesh. In this regard, several foreign  missions in Dhaka have cited the recent murder of an eminent  industrialist named Humayun Zahir. Campus violence and killing  has become routine. The labor union leaders do not hesitate to  hold the mill managers hostage to press their demands. These  factors not only deter foreign investors from coming, but also  discourage local entrepreneurs. Due to this, there has been no  development in the microeconomic sectors.</p>

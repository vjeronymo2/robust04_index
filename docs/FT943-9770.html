			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Woolwich edges ahead in competitive market The competitive pressures in the UK mortgage market were yesterday illustrated when Woolwich, the third largest UK building society, reported a 1.5 per cent improvement in first half operating profits from Pounds 161m to Pounds 163m. Pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 133m (Pounds 87.9m) as provisions for bad and doubtful debts fell to Pounds 29.9m (Pounds 72.7m). The society's general reserve rose to Pounds 1.33bn (Pounds 1.16bn), and gross capital rose to Pounds 1.71bn (Pounds 1.46bn). Net interest income rose only slightly to Pounds 249m (Pounds 241m) while income from other sources rose to Pounds 79.5m (Pounds 75.3m). Operating profits were reduced by a rise in administrative expenses to Pounds 166m (Pounds 156m). Mr Donald Kirkham, the society's chief executive, said it had built on the good results of last year 'nothwithstanding difficult market conditions'. He said that the mortgage market had been characterised by 'intense competition'. Mr Kirkham said the trading outlook was good, with a steady recovery in the housing market. He predicted that house prices would rise by 3 per cent during the year, while housing transactions would grow by some 6 to 7 per cent. The society's total mortgage lending dropped to Pounds 1.3bn (Pounds 1.6bn), and net retail receipts fell to just Pounds 22m (Pounds 389m). The society said that both mortgage and savings markets had been 'far more price-competitive than expected'. The gross ratio of capital to assets grew by 0.4 percentage points to 7.4 per cent, while the solvency ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets rose to 13.1 per cent (13.7 per cent).</p>

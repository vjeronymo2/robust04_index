			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Stephanie Bothma] </F>   [Text] Pretoria -- SA [South Africa] had grown into the  10th largest armaments supplier in the world and hoped to reap  the full benefits of its expertise as soon as the UN arms  embargo was lifted, Armscor [Armaments Corporation of South  Africa] marketing general manager Peet Smith said yesterday.    The armaments procurement company had issued 631 export  permits for arms worth more than 820m R[rand] over the past two  years.    Smith told military correspondents at a briefing that SA  would most likely become a member of the Missile Technology  Control Regime by October and Armscor was positioning itself for  this prospect.    SA was finalising a national arms control policy in terms of  which all arms-related control measures would be centralised  under the Defence Ministry, he said.    "Armscor has committed itself to becoming more transparent  and accountable, especially regarding aspects such as its arms  exports in international terms."    But, Smith said, Armscor found it difficult to thoroughly  police the final destiny and use of armaments manufactured in SA  because of a lack of co-operation between government bodies such  as the SA Police Services, Customs and Excise and the Trade and  Industry Department.    However, Armscor was committed to adhering to government  regulations and rules regarding client countries. Smith said SA  had a firm policy in terms of export clients and would under no  circumstances export to certain countries.    He said the list of client countries was classified, but,  for  example, SA had stopped supplying Rwanda several months ago when  civil war broke out there.    Smith said although Armscor suggested clients to whom SA  should sell its armaments, government had the final say in the  matter. "After all, we are only civil servants."    Smith agreed that Armscor, to a certain extent, had a  credibility problem because of its operations during the  sanctions years. But he said the company "never allowed anybody  in the industry to break SA's own rules and regulations".    He said it was Armscor's first priority to have the UN  embargoes lifted, and to achieve that, it would not tolerate any  transgression of any international regulation.</p>

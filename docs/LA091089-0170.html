			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARK DAVIS SETS TABLE AND THEN CLEANS UP DODGERS, 3-1;  </P> <P> PADRE RELIEVER WORKS OUT OF LAST-INNING JAM  </P> <P> Mark Davis entered Saturday night's game amid relative calm, in the ninth  inning with his San Diego Padres leading, 3-1, and a Dodger on first base.  </P> <P> Time for him to get comfortable. After striking out Eddie Murray, he caught a  Jeff Hamilton grounder in his bare hand, spun and threw the ball into center  field. Runners on first and third.  </P> <P> He threw four balls to pinch-hitter Mickey Hatcher. Bases loaded.  </P> <P> There. Now Davis had the Dodgers just where he wanted them.  </P> <P> With a left hand that was growing numb, he threw John Shelby a strike and then  fooled him into a fly-ball out. He threw Rick Dempsey a strike and then fooled  him into another fly-ball out.  </P> <P> End of game, continuation of Davis' roll. The Padres' 3-1 victory before 32,539  fans at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium -- their eighth straight win that Davis  has saved -- did more than just enhance Davis' reputation as the best relief  pitcher in the National League.  </P> <P> The Padres think the left-hander, 28, might be the best pitcher in the league,  period.  </P> <P> "If we come back and win this thing, he has to be the Cy Young (Award) winner,"  said Mark Parent, who caught Davis' ninth inning Saturday. "Day in, day out,  nobody has done what he has done."  </P> <P> Even though the Padres won Saturday's game on the strength of a tiebreaking,  two-run fifth inning off loser John Wetteland -- featuring rookie Jerald  Clark's run-scoring double and Bip Roberts' run-scoring single -- the lasting  memories will be of Davis.  </P> <P> He has a club-record 39 saves. He has a 2.16 earned-run average. And the Padres  can't keep him off the mound. He has pitched in seven of the Padres' last eight  games.  </P> <P> There should be no wonder why the Padres are on a club-record run of 14  victories in 16 games and have moved within five games of first-place San  Francisco in the National League West. The Padres are tied with Houston, which  defeated the Giants, 4-1, Saturday behind the pitching of another Cy Young  candidate, Mike Scott.  </P> <P> "That's what it should come down to, him or Scott," Padre pitching coach Pat  Dobson said. "When you look at a pitcher's value to a team, you have to  consider Mark.  </P> <P> "Where would we be without him? I can't speculate. I don't even want to  speculate."  </P> <P> The Dodgers might be five victories richer if it weren't for Davis, who has  saved five of the Padres' 10 wins over the Dodgers this year.  </P> <P> "He's got that great curveball, a real biting curveball, and he makes you hit  it," Dodger pitcher Tim Belcher said. "I'm even more impressed with how much he  pitches, but I wonder, how long can he go like that while breaking off those  curves?  </P> <P> "In three years, is he going to have a fastball left? Is he going to have an  arm left?"  </P> <P> The quiet Davis shrugged.  </P> <P> "I really don't twist my arm that much in my curve," he said. "It really feels  like a fastball. And as long as the thought process is the same, I'll feel  fine."  </P> <P> But about that Cy Young talk, he is almost apathetic.  </P> <P> "It is not something I'm going to think about," he said. "It's not going to  help our team right now."  </P> <P> Something that did help the Padres Saturday was the pitching of starter Ed  Whitson, who allowed only five hits in eight innings. And one of those hits was  by pinch-hitter Mike Davis, whose eighth-inning single was his first hit since  June 30, which was a few days before he underwent arthroscopic surgery on both  knees.  </P> <P> Whitson's pitching surprised the Dodgers because they usually pound him. He  entered with a 10-16 career record and a 4.17 ERA against them. He had already  lost to them three times this season, including a 10-1 defeat in Los Angeles  July 30 in which he allowed five runs in two innings.  </P> <P> The Dodger starter and loser, Wetteland (4-7, 3.26 ERA), proved again that he  could use a rule change. He needs a fourth-inning stretch. In his last four  starts, Wetteland has been splendid in the first three innings, allowing three  runs on nine hits during that span covering 12 innings.  </P> <P> But after the third inning, he has lasted an averaged of less than three more  innings a game. And during that time, nine innings total, he has allowed 10  runs on 14 hits.  </P> <P> Saturday, he allowed a run-scoring double to Jack Clark in the first inning but  then settled down to stop the Padres on one more hit until the fifth. Then it  was the same old story.  </P> <P> Benito Santiago, who had drawn only 22 walks in 402 previous at-bats, led off  with a walk. Wetteland then threw his 13th wild pitch of the season, bringing  him closer to Sandy Koufax's club record of 17 set in 1958.  </P> <P> One out later, facing .158-hitting rookie Jerald Clark, Wetteland made a wild  pitch within the strike zone. The ball hung, Clark swung, and seconds later  Clark was gliding into second base with a run-scoring double into the  right-field corner.  </P> <P> Wetteland appeared to calm down when he retired Whitson on a fly-ball out. But  then Roberts lined a run-scoring single to left to complete the scoring.  </P> <P> Dodger Notes  </P> <P> Mike Marshall missed his second start in the last four games, again with a  stiff lower back. Marshall finally admitted what several opposing players have  guessed -- he has been playing in pain. "I cost the team the game (Friday)  night -- I have to take myself out when I start directly affecting outcomes,"  Marshall said of Friday's 1-0 loss to San Diego in which he hit a weak foul  pop-up to the first baseman with one out and runners on second and third in the  sixth. "It's been hurting the last couple of weeks, and normally I can deal  with it. But when it's hurting more than me, it's time to rest." Marshall said  he knew he might not be able to play every day after missing 27 games in June  with a stiff lower back. "This is a major thing I'm going through -- I knew the  problems wouldn't end when I came off the disabled list," he said. "I knew I  would have good times and bad times. But when you look at it, the bad times  have been few and far between." Marshall has missed only eight of 63 games  since coming off the disabled list. He said he hopes that this winter he can  strengthen his back so it will no longer be a topic of discussion. "I'm slowly  building the back up, I've got the winter to work hard, I know what I've got to  do to strengthen it," Marshall said. "Right now, it's very frustrating."  </P> <P> The Dodgers recalled right-handed pitchers Jeff Fischer and Mike Hartley and  shortstop Jose Vizcaino from their triple-A Albuquerque club. Fischer was 12-10  as a starter with a 3.47 ERA, and Hartley was 7-4 as a reliever with a 2.79  ERA. Vizcaino hit .283 with one home run and 44 RBIs. Not that any of the three  will see any action. Catcher Darrin Fletcher was recalled Sept. 1 and has yet  to play.  </P> <P> Padre catcher Mark Parent walked up to Dodger catcher Mike Scioscia before  Friday's game here and said, "I have a thank-you card for you, but I forgot to  send it." Scioscia wondered why Parent would be sending a card. "For that big  contract you just signed," Parent said of Scioscia's three-year, $5.55-million  deal. "You've made life better for catchers everywhere."  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 3, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN ONE;  </P> <P> LOTTERY WINS SOME, LOSES SOME;  </P> <P> IT CELEBRATES ITS FIFTH BIRTHDAY AS THE LARGEST IN NORTH AMERICA. BUT OFFICIALS  ADMIT THEY HAVE HAD A STRING OF BAD LUCK AS NEW GAMES FAIL TO INCREASE  REVENUES.  </P> <P> By all rights, it should be a phenomenal success story -- a business that has  grown from nothing to $10.6 billion in sales in five years, created 3,000 jobs  and given schools $4 billion to boot.  </P> <P> But as the California Lottery modestly celebrates its fifth birthday this week,  it is getting as much criticism as it is accolades.  </P> <P> Revenues on its major games -- Lotto, Decco and Scratchers -- are flat. Many of  its hard-core players are angry about a change in the Lotto game that  dramatically heightened the odds of losing. A public-interest group is starting  a campaign against its advertising, labeling it "misleading and deceptive."  </P> <P> Most troublesome of all, today, the day the lottery commemorates its first  ticket sales in 1985, a state Senate committee is convening to question lottery  officials about some of their business decisions.  </P> <P> Lottery officials, who see the creation of a multibillion-dollar business in  five years as nothing short of "incredible," seem mystified by the sudden  onslaught of criticism. They concede that they may have miscalculated some  players' reaction to the change in the Lotto odds, but they say the lottery --  like everything else -- has been the victim of economic conditions.  </P> <P> "Is Disneyland mismanaged because the oil crisis is resulting in their tourism  being down?" asked Chon Gutierrez, the ebullient director of California's  lottery. "Is government mismanaged because there is a recession and revenues  are down and the budget is tight?"  </P> <P> Even in good economic times, he said, the lottery is a roller coaster business.  Revenues soar when jackpots, new games and new twists in old games spark  players' interest and slide when the novelty wears off. Whenever there is a dip  in enthusiasm, he said, lottery management adjusts the games to reignite player  interest, but often it takes time to reach a new high.  </P> <P> Players are seeing a typical slide, he said, that is exacerbated by economic  uncertainty.  </P> <P> I. Nelson Rose, a Whittier College law professor and expert on gambling law,  agreed. He said it is common for lotteries to come under intense criticism  after about five years of operation.  </P> <P> "Remember, this is a consumer item and it is a very poor consumer item," he  said. "The chances of winning a significant prize are so small that people are  literally being frustrated every day of their lives. What they're doing is  airing that frustration. The state lottery isn't doing anything it shouldn't be  doing. The problem is people are spending a lot of money on the lottery and  losing."  </P> <P> Even the criticism cannot overshadow the fact that the lottery celebrates its  fifth birthday firmly entrenched in the California lifestyle. From an operation  that began with four secretaries and three executives in March, 1985, it has  become the biggest lottery in North America and the fifth largest in the world.  </P> <P> Since 1985, 90% of California adults have played the lottery at least once,  according to state lottery figures. On its busiest days, it logs more  transactions than the New York Stock Exchange. In five years it has made 577  people millionaires and distributed about $5.2 billion in prizes.  </P> <P> Who plays the lottery is a question that has been debated over its five-year  lifetime. Critics claim it preys on the poor by capitalizing on dreams of a  better life. Lottery officials say they try to attract urban professionals and  the well-to-do. Independent polls by the Los Angeles Times in 1986 and 1987  showed the lottery was most popular with individuals who earn from $10,000 to  $40,000 annually, with blue-collar workers and with men.  </P> <P> Enthusiasm for the lottery in California began before the first ticket was  sold. On Nov. 6, 1984, voters overwhelmingly approved an initiative  establishing California as a lottery state despite a vigorous opposing campaign  from church groups and parimutuel gambling interests.  </P> <P> Leo McElroy, the political consultant who ran the campaign to try to defeat the  lottery, said once the issue was settled at the polls, active opposition seemed  to cease. "The people who didn't like it didn't have to play," he said.  </P> <P> Its early success helped lottery fever spread to other states. In 1984,  California was the 21st state to approve a lottery. Today, 30 states and the  District of Columbia have lotteries.  </P> <P> Despite its popularity and general public acceptance, there are some public  officials who acknowledge an uneasiness. Although at least 34% of lottery  revenues must be dedicated to public education, there is a widespread feeling  even among the original promoters of the lottery that it has not been that good  for education.  </P> <P> So much emphasis in the original promotion of the lottery was given to the  benefits for education, they said, that in many voters' minds it became a  solution to education's money problems.  </P> <P> "People thought all of a sudden it would be this cornucopia of endless funds  for education. It was an unrealistic expectation," said Rose.  </P> <P> In the early years, bond issues and other efforts to raise money for education  were defeated in part because voters believed the lottery had already taken  care of education, critics and supporters agree.  </P> <P> Barry Fadem, a San Francisco lawyer who sponsored and helped author the  initiative for Scientific Games in 1984, said the lottery's promoters put so  much emphasis on the billions of dollars that the games of chance would raise  for education that voters never understood those billions only represented 3%  of education's total budget.  </P> <P> "My only regret is that a lot of California voters carried the impression that  the lottery would solve all of California's education funding woes," said  Fadem.  </P> <P> Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig said he originally opposed the lottery  initiative, believing that it would never be the "icing on the cake" for  education that its promoters promised. He said he suspected -- and experience  in the initial years has proved him right -- that the money given to education  by the lottery would encourage the governor and Legislature to provide less  from other sources.  </P> <P> Honig, who has no criticism of the way the lottery is being run, talks, as do  many public officials, of being troubled by the fact that a state-run gambling  operation is used to finance the education of California's young people.  </P> <P> "We are certainly appreciative of the money but I'm just uncomfortable  encouraging people to gamble," he said. "There's a philosophical problem. Here  we're trying to tell kids work hard, study hard, make the long, slow effort to  learn and it will pay off. And then we have advertising on television that says  play the lottery and lightning will strike."  </P> <P> Controller Gray Davis, whose office regularly audits the lottery, said, "If I  had to grade the lottery I'd give it a B. It has fulfilled its mission to  provide an additional 3% funding to schools. . . . On the other hand, I feel  badly that revenue for important public services such as education have to be  generated by gambling."  </P> <P> In the same vein, Carl Oshiro, supervising attorney for the University of San  Diego's Center for Public Interest Law, has filed a complaint with lottery  officials contending that its television advertising is misleading because it  fails to disclose the odds of winning.  </P> <P> "Here we have the state of California teaching folks through its advertising  that gambling ought to be part of their daily life, part of their daily routine  and spending massive amounts of money to do it," Oshiro said. "It didn't seem  to us that there was any money spent on putting out any other message either in  terms of what the product really is or perhaps warning people of the  consequences of excessive gambling."  </P> <P> Gutierrez said it would be difficult to disclose the odds in a 30-second  television spot. He said the agency is considering some type of advertising  campaign to warn against excessive gambling. He said that under his direction  the lottery has been careful never to use children in advertising or promote  its link to education as reason people should gamble.  </P> <P> The lottery has been one of the top advertisers in the state -- last year it  spent $63.9 million on advertising and promotion -- since it opened its doors  in 1985 with a game called Scratchers, which allowed the player to scratch off  the surface of each $1 ticket to determine if it was a winner. A year later, it  was advertising another game, Lotto, which was to become its most popular  offering.  </P> <P> Initially, players selected six numbers from a field of 49 and the winning  combinations were picked during televised Saturday night drawings. Now, players  pick from a field of 53 and drawings are held Wednesdays and Saturdays. The  lottery has recently added Decco, a game using card symbols, and Topper, an  add-on to the Lotto game that utilizes the names of California cities.  </P> <P> Except for Topper, the results for all games in recent months have been  disappointing. Decco has not produced the revenue that Lottery officials  anticipated. Scratchers has been in a steady decline and Lotto revenues have  not surged to their heights of a year ago. At the end of the 1989-90 fiscal  year, the lottery reported that its total sales revenues would be $100 million  less than the previous year.  </P> <P> In a move designed to produce more super-jackpots, officials in June expanded  the field of numbers from which Lotto players can pick. Instead of choosing  from 49 numbers, players are allowed to choose from 53. The idea was that by  increasing the odds from 1 in 14 million to 1 in 23 million, fewer jackpots  would be won and there would be more roll-overs. An accumulation of roll-overs  produces the super-jackpots.  </P> <P> Since the change, however, there has been no string of super-jackpots and  revenue has not increased appreciably.  </P> <P> Larry Love, editor of The Lotto Edge, a Los Angeles-based newsletter that  caters to regular players, said the change in odds caused the backbone of the  lottery's business -- the hard-core player -- to cut back.  </P> <P> "What's happened is exactly what the regular players told them would happen a  year ago. The consensus among us was we would either stop playing or play less  (if the odds were changed)," he said. "Many of my readers did exactly that.  People who were playing $40 and $50 a game or even $100 a game now play $5 or  $10."  </P> <P> Sen. Ralph C. Dills (D-Gardena), chairman of the Senate Governmental  Organization Committee that oversees the lottery, has asked lottery officials  to be prepared to defend the change and explain at his hearing today how they  expected to increase sales by reducing a player's chance of winning.  </P> <P> Gutierrez said the increase in sales would have come naturally if the change to  53 numbers had produced a number of super-jackpots. But the lottery has been  faced with the same thing that many gamblers face -- bad luck. Since the  change, there has been one $44-million jackpot, and that unfortunately occurred  at the same time Florida had a $106-million jackpot. The California jackpot,  which in other times would have attracted major publicity, looked like small  potatoes.  </P> <P> On top of that, Gutierrez said he could never have foreseen the crisis in the  Middle East, which sent gasoline prices soaring, pushing the economy into a  slump and leaving consumers with less expendable cash.  </P> <P> "Had we anticipated perhaps the things that are driving the economy to be a  little bit soft like the gulf crisis, had all of this been in our crystal ball,  then obviously we would have made the (change) a year ago," he said.  </P> <P> Gutierrez said it is still early to determine whether the Lotto change is a  success or failure. He said the lottery is taking the criticism from the  players seriously and is planning a new game in a few weeks -- possibly a Lotto  game with a number field of 39 -- which will offer top prizes of about $1  million and better odds.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, experts disagree on the long-term significance of the criticism.  Fadem believes it will quickly fade; Rose agrees but suggests that overall  doubts about the lottery may linger.  </P> <P> "I don't view this as a long-term problem," said Fadem. "It (player interest)  moves in cycles. Looking back over the last five years, I think they've done a  helluva job and I think in general Californians are satisfied with the games  that are available."  </P> <P> Rose observed that lotteries, like their games, go through cycles. In  post-Colonial days of the 1820s and 1830s, it was "easier to buy a lottery  ticket than it is today." By the Civil War, they had nearly disappeared. After  the war, the economic devastation in the South sparked a revival. Then, by the  turn of the century, there were no legal lotteries in the United States.  </P> <P> "We go through these great swings from permissiveness to prohibition," Rose  said. "We're definitely on the upswing of a permissive era now, but the  question is, 'Will it last?' I am sure after the Civil War it was inconceivable  that they would ever be outlawed, but (several decades later) they were."  </P> <P> </P> <P> (Southland Edition) STATE LOTTERY REVENUES  </P> <P>  A look at the California State Lottery's roller coaster revenues of the past  five years -- and its contributions to education.  </P> <P> </P> <TABLE CWL="2.44IN:2.55IN:2.66IN:2.11IN:2.66IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="5"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> CONTRIB.

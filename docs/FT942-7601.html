			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Ferry group plans two rail bids Sea Containers, the container and Hoverspeed ferries group, plans to bid for two British Rail franchises, but on terms which fall outside the government's guidelines. The group would make its offers conditional on obtaining a long lease on the rail track concerned and on acquiring its own rolling stock. Bids on these terms would be regarded as 'non-compliant' but would still have to be considered by Mr Roger Salmon, the rail franchising director. Normally the government would require train operators to rent track from Railtrack, the company created to own track and signalling. It also expects most operators to lease their rolling stock. Sea Containers is considering bids for BR's Great Western franchise running from London Paddington and the South West Trains franchise from London Waterloo. The franchises would complement Sea Containers' ferry operations between the mainland and the Isle of Wight. The franchises, which are expected to attract management buy-out bids, are in the first round of BR routes to be privatised in 1995. 'We would want to lease our own right of way for 99 years, effectively for ever, and maintain the track and signalling ourselves,' said Mr James Sherwood, president of Sea Containers. 'We would also ultimately want to supply our own rolling stock though we would start by leasing BR stock.' Mr Sherwood, whose company owns the Orient Express train service, the only private passenger service to run on BR track, has called for 50-year franchises, instead of the periods of seven to 15 years suggested by the government. He described the Treasury decision to seek a 5.6 per cent return, rising to 8 per cent, on BR's assets as 'absurd'. 'The government should have written down BR's asset values, to create a company with a sensible capital base.' The present franchising framework, involving leased rolling stock and rented track and stations, appeared to have been designed to attract management buy-out teams. He added: 'The railway network will run down because no one will be putting any capital in. You can't really control your destiny because you could lose your franchise at any moment. BR staff will form groups and take over franchises with Pounds 100 of capital. They will just be selling their expertise.' If Sea Containers won a franchise it would seek cost reductions and increase the marketing of train services. 'We would put on all the usual pressures to get an efficient transport system,' Mr Sherwood said.</p>

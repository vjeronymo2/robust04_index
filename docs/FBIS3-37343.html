			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Valdis Birkavs, prime minister of the </F> Republic of Latvia, by Pol Mathil; place and date not given: "On  Latvia, `Partnership For Peace'"]    [Text] [Mathil] With your accession, the three Baltic  states are among the first eight countries to adhere to the  Partnership for Peace. Do they have a particular reason for  being in such a hurry?    [Birkavs] We are not in any more of a hurry than anyone  else,  but you only need to look at the map to understand. For us,  security has its own dynamic, its own timetable, and nothing can  be done before its time comes, and nothing after it has passed.  I believe that now is the time.    [Mathil] Why precisely now? Have the results of the Russian  elections exerted any pressure on the timetable?    [Birkavs] Certainly. After the Russian elections I stated  that security was now the number one issue. We are very close  neighbors, we are deeply interested in developments inside  Russia.    [Mathil] Should we consider that you place yourself within  what the Russians term as the "near abroad" where, in the words  of Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev, Moscow has "legitimate  interests"?    [Birkavs] Of course not. Admittedly, we are neighbors and I  suppose will always remain so. Unfortunately, Mr. Kozyrev said  some very muddled things about Russian "interests" in the Baltic  states, without ever really explaining what this means.    [Mathil] It is this Monday also that discussions on the  withdrawal of Russian soldiers are due to restart in Riga. How  many remain in Latvia?    [Birkavs] About 10,000.    [Mathil] You are going to leave a major radar base in  Skrunda  (150 kilometers west of Riga) in Russian hands for another four  years, followed by 18 months to dismantle it. Is it true that  you agreed to this under pressure from NATO and the European  Union?    [Birkavs] Clinton and Yeltsin set this timetable at their  last summit. This compromise will be debated by our parliament.  We do not want to adopt too rigid a position with regard to the  West, but nothing will be done without parliament's approval.    [Mathil] Why is this base so important to the Russians?    [Birkavs] It is just one aspect of the pressure they are  exerting on us. The Russians have three instruments: Their  army, the Russian-speaking minority, and economic dependency.  The military question is now being settled. The nationality  law is being debated by parliament. We must face the  consequences of a genuine colonization.    [Mathil] Do you accept dual nationality?    [Birkavs] Never.    [Mathil] There remains economic dependency: The Russian  government has just threatened to cut off gas supplies to Latvia  for non-payment of its debt.    [Birkavs] This debt does not exist. We signed an accord with  GazProm (Russian gas company) which Moscow has unilaterally  cancelled.    [Mathil] Is not the general manager of GazProm none other  than Victor Chernomyrdin, Russia's present prime minister?    [Birkavs] Yes. He knows that we owe them nothing. They are  trying to make gas a political issue. That is how dependency is  created, it is not only economic.    [Mathil] Do you believe the `Partnership For Peace' can help  you to overcome this type of difficulty, and free you from  various forms of dependency?    [Birkavs] The Partnership is a major step in the right  direction, but it is no more than a step, the first step toward  a satisfactory security structure. It contains no formal  guarantee.    [Mathil] What is your analysis of the situation in Moscow?    [Birkavs] If the Russians really carry out the economic  reforms they will have to face a number of very difficult years,  but after that their prospects will be favorable. If they do  not carry out the reforms, they will also have a number of very  difficult years, with no other prospect in view. In other  words, in two years time, at the time of the presidential  elections, the situation is in any case going to be very tense  and a radical and nationalist president could be voted into  power.    [Mathil] You are not very optimistic. What to do about  Russia?    [Birkavs] Recently, when I attended the economic forum in  Davos everyone asked me that same question. Nobody had the  answer.    [Mathil] How do you explain that Russia has not yet reacted  to the `Partnership for Peace'? Do you think there is a debate  on this subject within the Kremlin?    [Birkavs] Yes, I believe so. When we had to take a decision  on this question, we consulted all the political forces in the  country. It would be natural for such a debate to take place in  the Kremlin.    [Birkavs] What do you think of NATO's ultimatum in Sarajevo?  Do you think it sets a precedent? Would you like to see NATO  intervene in a similar way in other European conflicts? In the  Baltic region for example?    [Birkavs] Faced with a situation as explosive as in the  former Yugoslavia, you must adopt a very strong but also a very  prudent position. The NATO ultimatum satisfies these criteria.  It is a positive step. It is just one means of action. We  will see the result.</p>

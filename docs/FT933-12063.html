			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / France urges air cover for UN soldiers: Retaliation threat to Serbs FRENCH Foreign Minister Alain Juppe yesterday pressed for air cover for United Nations peace-keeping troops in Bosnia, after French UN soldiers had come under artillery fire in Sarajevo on Sunday, Reuter reports from Paris. 'We need air cover for our troops,' Mr Juppe said on television. France would ask the Nato alliance 'in the coming hours' to finalise its planning for the use of aircraft. Nato has already assembled 60 combat aircraft in Italy to help peace-keepers if they are attacked while protecting designated 'safe areas' for Moslems, including Sarajevo. 'Nato has been working for weeks on operational planning for this force and we must act now,' Mr Juppe said. UN forces condemned the Serb bombardment as cowardly and threatened to retaliate if they came under attack again. Lt-Gen Francis Briquemont, commander of UN troops in Bosnia, said his men had been 'maliciously' targeted by Serb gunners. 'That is the last time that we restrain ourselves from exercising our right to self-defence,' he said. The French escaped injury in the attack but several armoured vehicles were severely damaged. The bombardment came just hours after a ceasefire was supposed to have gone into effect. General Jean Cot, a French officer who commands all UN troops in former Yugoslavia, arrived in Sarajevo to visit the scene of the attack and said he fully supported Gen Briquemont's stand. 'It is probably the most serious and the most cowardly attack (on UN forces) since the start of this unfortunate affair,' he said. 'It is clear. . . the attack came from a Serb unit.' The French troops who came under attack were not able to respond, but action had been taken so they could retaliate in future, said Gen Cot. He declined to give details. Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, denied his forces were responsible, accusing Moslems of having mounted the attack to undermine peace talks due to start in Geneva today.</p>

			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Stakis recovers with Pounds 10.4m - Restructuring completed: 'we're just a normal boring company now' Stakis, the hotels and casinos group, confirmed its recovery in 1993 by making pre-tax profits of Pounds 10.4m against a loss of Pounds 47.4m last time, when the figure was hit by an exceptional provision of Pounds 47.7m. After two years of restructuring, asset sales and a capital injection, the Glasgow-based group is now 'a normal company, boring even,' said Mr David Michels, chief executive. Thanks to last year's Pounds 28m rights issue and the sale of the nursing homes, debt fell to Pounds 117m at the October 3 year-end against Pounds 197m, cutting gearing from 77 per cent to 46 per cent. Sir Lewis Robertson, chairman, said the results owed 'little to the market and virtually everything to the group's own endeavours.' Operating profits on continuing businesses increased by Pounds 6m to Pounds 25.6m. Hotels increased operating profit by Pounds 3.7m to Pounds 19.6m and achieved an average occupancy rate of 69 per cent. Room rates hardened slightly. The company now has 31 hotels following its purchase of a hotel in York for Pounds 5m. Casinos increased operating profit by Pounds 3.1m to Pounds 10.9m. Business was slightly up, particularly in casinos south of Leeds, and the division enjoyed the benefit of tighter management. Three casinos were acquired in the Midlands. Turnover on continuing businesses was Pounds 130.8m in the 53 week period (Pounds 124m for 52 weeks). Discontinued businesses had turnover of Pounds 9.47m (Pounds 30m). Earnings per share came out at 2.81p (losses of 17.38p). There is a recommended final dividend of 0.55p. The interim dividend was restored during the year at 0.45p, making a total of 1p (0.45p). COMMENT Stakis is now a well-run company. The profit increase is impressive given that it had little help from the economic upturn, as shown by the modest turnover growth in the 53 weeks. Since the year end hotel room rates and occupancy have been rising slightly, and the casinos had a good first quarter. After attracting a disproportionate amount of media attention for its troubles Stakis says it wants to be boring. But it would be a pity if that meant passing up opportunities among the many hotels now on the market. Analysts are looking for Pounds 17m pre-tax profit in 1994, putting the shares on a prospective multiple of about 18, and for Pounds 21m next year. The share price, up 4p to 75p yesterday, already reflects much of the stock's recovery.</p>

			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / International Company News: Union opposition delays merger of Japanese regional banks A plan inspired by the Japanese finance ministry to merge three small regional banks has been delayed by opposition from staff and clients. Kita-Nippon Bank, Shokusan Bank and Tokuyo City Bank, all based in Tohoku, northern Japan, have shelved the accord which was due to be signed at the end of last month. To the ministry's annoyance, unions at Kita-Nippon and Shokusan objected on the grounds that Tokuyo City's estimated Y100bn (Dollars 917m) of bad loans, larger than their own, would erode their banks' profits. Mr Hirohisa Fuji, finance minister, had given the scheme his public blessing and said there would be more like it. The banks' executives are now struggling to get the merger back on track and aim to call shareholders' meetings in the autumn in order to get approval. This is an unusual blow to the finance ministry's strategy of encouraging stronger regional banks to take over weaker ones. The aim is to bolster weaker banks' balance sheets without a public bail-out, achieve economies of scale in the fragmented regional banking industry and avoid a crisis of confidence in regional institutions. The government has guided at least three such mergers in the past three years. Tokuyo City lost Y1bn before tax last year, down from a Y7.6bn loss in 1992, due to stock losses. The new institution, to be called Heisei Bank, would have deposits of Y2,190bn and 225 branches, making it the fifth-largest of the second-tier regional banks. In another sign of the industry's continuing debt problems, Apollo Leasing, an unquoted leasing company with Y530bn borrowings, yesterday admitted that it was asking its creditor banks for a second cut in interest payments. Apollo obtained a rate reduction two years ago, but says it cannot sell property collateral fast enough to finance payments. Like many non-banking financial institutions, Apollo borrowed to lend on the back of property, the value of which has collapsed during the recession.</p>

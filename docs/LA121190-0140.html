			<p><P> December 11, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOYS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: DEREK REAVES  </P> <P> School: Esperanza High School  </P> <P> Sport: Football  </P> <P> Position: Safety  </P> <P> Class: Senior  </P> <P> Esperanza's opponents have learned at their peril not to pass Reaves' way. In  the Division III championship game Saturday night, St. Paul learned too late,  and Reaves made the Swordsmen pay by intercepting two passes in a 25-7 victory.  The two interceptions gave Reaves 11 for the season, which ties the  single-season school record and is two shy of the county record shared by  Reggie West of Santa Ana Valley (1975) and Steve Stocking of Pacifica (1978).  Reaves had a 12th interception in his hands against St. Paul, but it was  accidentally knocked away by a teammate. "He just plays a key, key role in our  secondary," Esperanza Coach Gary Meek said. "He's won some big, big games for  us." Most notable were Reaves' four interceptions -- one for a 69-yard  touchdown -- against Westminster and his interception at the Aztecs' three-yard  line in the final seconds of a 12-7 victory over Loara.  </P> <P> Other top performers:  </P> <P> Flavio Bernal, who scored five goals in Tustin's 7-2 soccer victory Tuesday  over Laguna Beach in the Irvine tournament. Bernal scored another goal Friday  to help Tustin defeat Trabuco Hills, 3-2, and advance to the consolation  championship game.  </P> <P> Son Ly, who was named the most valuable player of the Laguna Beach basketball  tournament after scoring 23 points in Estan cia's 69-68 victory over Lynwood in  the title game Saturday.  </P> <P> Tomek Mikler, who kicked a 22-yard field goal with 18 seconds left in the  Division II title game Saturday to give Capistrano Valley a 17-15 victory over  Paramount.  </P> <P> John Molle, who averaged 33 points while leading Irvine to the championship of  the Tipoff Classic tournament. Molle scored 27 points in a 75-59 victory over  Newport Harbor in the title game Wednesday.  </P> <P> Dave Whitby, who caught three passes for 96 yards and a touchdown and made a  key interception in the fourth quarter to help Whittier Christian to a 34-21  victory over Tehachapi in theDivision IX championship game Saturday.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A total of 126 PNP [Peruvian National Police]  officers, including colonels, commanders, and majors were  "invited" to retire on 3 February, according to an Interior  Ministry supreme resolution that explains that the purpose is to  renew the cadres.    The list of the 126 officers includes 70 colonels, 17 from  the General Police [PG], 19 from the Technical Police [PT],  three from the Security Police [PS], and 31 from the Police  Forces Health Unit.    Also, 36 commanders, of which seven belong to the PG, 22 to  the PT, four to the PS, and three to the Police Health Unit.    The list also includes 20 majors: Five from the PG, 12 the  PT, and three the PS.    It was learned that in the next few days this measure also  will affect captains, lieutenants, and second lieutenants.    Police sources who asked to remain anonymous, said the  "invitation" was delivered on 3 February to the homes of the  affected policemen who will have to accept it.    It also was disclosed that six generals retired last  December.    The sources noted that disciplinary measures played a strong  role in the aforementioned "invitation" because a commission  assessed the respective service records of all the commanders  between 1989 and 1993.    In the case of retirement for years of service, the sources  said that those who graduated between 1961 and 1963 were  included.    It was also disclosed that those "invited" to retire will  not  lose any of their benefits. In the case that they were found  liable for promotion to the next rank, they will get the salary  and fringe benefits of the next rank.    This measure, as well as changes announced by the  Counterterrorism Division (Dincote) and the Crime Investigative  National Directorate [Direccion Nacional de Investigacion  Criminal -- Dinincri], has generated uncertainty within the PNP,  according to the same sources.    As is known, a few days ago PNP Director General Victor Alva  Plasencia asserted that police stations that [words indistinct]  to the public and carry out street services will be reinforced  to do a better job.    He did not specify, however, if the reinforcement will come  from Dinincri.    Moreover, on that occasion he said that in view of the  reduction of terrorist actions, the crime prevention service  will be reinforced so the citizenry can carry out its activities  normally.    In this regard, Alva Plasencia only said that the units will  continue doing their job and that there is no estimate of the  percentage of personnel that will be rationalized.    In referring to Dincote, he said it will continue doing its  job throughout the country.</p>

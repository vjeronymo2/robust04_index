			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): Feedback . . . - Briefcase I read with great interest the article in the Weekend FT (November 5) by Kevin Goldstein-Jackson headlined: 'The wrong policies'. I agree entirely that 'people should be encouraged to create and manage their own pension fund, rather than having to invest through an institution'. I would, however, prefer this to apply to Peps. These were introduced as an incentive to the private investor to save and invest in the stock market. But the only real winners have been fund managers and brokers whose income has been increased through the purchase and ongoing management charges of Peps. I feel that to encourage people to manage their own personal pension fund would be too politically sensitive because, if it failed, the individual might become reliant on state benefits (ie, income support, housing benefit, etc.). But this should not be the case with Peps, as their pension should still be available. I appreciate that this would not have the same impact on the balance of shareholder power. But if more people were attracted to Peps, it would be a step in the right direction to increasing that power.

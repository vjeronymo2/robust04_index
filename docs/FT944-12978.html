			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Santer nears deal on naming posts for EU commissioners Mr Jacques Santer, next president of the European Commission, was last night close to a deal over the apportioning of new portfolios, the first test of his grip on colleagues and clout with member states. Pressure was increasing on the two hold-outs - Sir Leon Brittan and Mr Hans Van den Broek - to fall into line at today's meeting in a Luxembourg chateau attended by the new 21-strong Commission. A deal would enhance the reputation of Mr Santer, who has displayed a shrewd touch and a steely determination during tense negotiations over portfolios. The chief obstacle remains the allocation of responsibilities in external relations, with Sir Leon, the chief EU trade negotiator, reluctant to cede responsibility for relations with central and eastern Europe to Mr Van den Broek, the former Dutch foreign minister, who is in charge of political affairs. Sir Leon would retain the powerful multilateral trade portfolio as well as relations with the US and Japan; but he would lose a plum area since one of the main tasks of the next Commission will be to lay the groundwork for EU membership for Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary. Mr Van den Broek is also uneasy about Mr Santer's plan to assume personal control over foreign and security policy, though he has received assurances that he will still be responsible for orthodox diplomacy. Officials close to Mr Santer portray the foreign policy plan as a bid to break up personal fiefdoms. Others suspect he intends to dilute the Commission's role in foreign policy-making in deference to the member states. On Thursday, Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister whose bid last summer to succeed Mr Delors failed only because of a UK veto, warned against the Commission yielding powers which it won in tHe Maastricht treaty. One surprise is the expected announcement that Mr Franz Fischler, the former Austrian agricultural minister, will take over the farm portfolio, which accounts for half of the annual Ecu70bn (Pounds 55bn) EU budget. Other key posts expected to be agreed today include the Emu portfolio to Mr Yves-Thibault de Silguy, a French civil servant; transport to Mr Neil Kinnock, the former UK Labour party leader; internal market to Professor Mario Monti, a leading Italian economist; and fish to Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, a Norwegian diplomat.

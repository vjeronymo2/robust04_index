			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOYS' BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> KOSTOFF GETS 40 POINTS, BUT EDISON ROLLS PAST CAPISTRANO VALLEY, 82-59  </P> <P> Capistrano Valley High School, considered by some to be the best two-man team  in Orange County, was reduced to a one-man show Wednesday night in its  nonleague game at Edison.  </P> <P> Capistrano Valley forward Scott McCorkle, who only five days ago scored 33  points in an impressive victory over Ocean View, sat out an 82-59 loss to  Edison.  </P> <P> "(McCorkle) has been sick every game we've played this year," Coach Mark  Thornton said. "He had pneumonia before the season started and then got the  flu. Since then, he's been practicing or playing, and he can't get over it."  </P> <P> Guard Chris Kostoff had to carry the offensive load with McCorkle sidelined,  and he kept pace with a very good Edison team for three quarters. Kostoff  scored 40 points, including eight three-pointers, but Capistrano Valley (7-2)  lost for the second time in its past three games.  </P> <P> Edison (7-2) put the game away early in the fourth quarter. Forward Steve Thobe  completed a three-point play to push Edison ahead, 56-44, with 6:13 remaining  and then teammate Brandon Jessie scored on a dunk following a steal for a  14-point lead moments later.  </P> <P> Kostoff posted impressive numbers, but Jessie was easily the most impressive  player on the court. The sophomore and son of former Ram receiver Ron Jessie is  the most graceful athlete to compete in the Sunset League since Emile Harry was  a two-sport star at Fountain Valley.  </P> <P> Jessie repeatedly used his quick first step to drive to the basket, scoring 23  points. He also pulled down 11 rebounds and blocked three shots.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't trade him for anybody else his age," said Jon Borchert, Edison's  coach. "All he needs is the experience to become a great player. He certainly  has the athletic ability."  </P> <P> Edison has five starters returning from last year's tri-championship team, and  with the emergence of Jessie, the Chargers figure to contend with any team in  the county. While Edison beat one of the county's best teams, Borchert said his  players were disappointed that McCorkle didn't play.  </P> <P> "They were really excited about playing against him, and when he didn't play,  that took some of the edge off the game," Borchert said. "But I was happy with  the way everyone played tonight."  </P> <P> The victory may have been costly, however. Bill Martineau, Edison's 6-foot-9  center who has signed with UC Santa Barbara, left in the third quarter  complaining of lower back pain. Martineau had a back injury last summer that  limited his playing time.  </P> <P> "We're going to have to wait and see how it goes tomorrow," Borchert said. "I'd  hate to lose him now, I've only had him healthy for a week and a half."  </P> <P> Edison made 21 of 27 shots in the second half but Kostoff's three-point  shooting kept Capistrano Valley close for a while. Sixth-man Todd Smyser helped  Edison pull away in the fourth quarter, however, by scoring 10 of his 16 points  down the stretch.  </P> <P> "They're a good team, and unfortunately, Kostoff was the only shooter we had on  the court tonight," Thornton said. "I figure league (play) is more important,  so we've got to have Scott healthy. That's all there is to it."  </P> <P> In other nonleague basketball:  </P> <P> Tustin 52, Servite 44 -- Thomas Clayton had 13 points and David Beilstein had  12 to lead host Tustin (9-0). Steve Marusich led all scorers with 18 points and  Adam Anderson added 14 for Servite (6-4).  </P> <P> Loara 90, Villa Park 73 -- Tes Whitlock had 23 points and 12 assists and Joey  Guadio had 23 points and 11 rebounds to lead host Loara (7-0). Ellick Hsu added  13 for Loara.  </P> <P> Irvine 58, Woodbridge 57 -- John Molle scored 34 points, including two free  throws with 12 seconds left, to give Irvine (5-5) the victory over visiting  Woodbridge (5-4). Molle, a 6-foot-5 junior forward, had missed the three  previous games with a sprained ankle. He was 11 of 17 from the field, including  a pair of three-point goals, and was 10 of 10 from the free line. He also had  10 rebounds.  </P> <P> Santa Ana Valley 51, Southern California Christian 48 -- Southern California  Christian's rally led by Shawn Wiltshire, who made two three-point shots in the  fourth quarter, fell short. Wiltshire led all scorers with 20 points. Scottie  Strong scored 14 and Sean Wilson had 12 for Santa Ana Valley (2-4).  </P> <P> Gahr 73, Sunny Hills 58 -- Brandon Titus scored 27 points to lead Gahr at Sunny  Hills. David Ragsdale scored 14 for Sunny Hills.  </P> <P> Norco 57, Canyon 44 -- Kevin Wilborn had 15 points for host Canyon (3-5).  </P> <P> In the Carson City, Nev., Tournament:  </P> <P> El Toro 64, Hug (Reno) 51 -- Greg Everett had 17 points and 10 rebounds to lead  El Toro (6-1), which never trailed. Kevin Martin and Rob Johnson each had 15  points and Kirk Riddle had eight points and a game-high 12 rebounds.  </P> <P> In the Fullerton Tournament:  </P> <P> Fullerton 63, Garden Grove 59 -- Trailing, 61-48, with 3:23 remaining, the  Argonauts scored 11 consecutive points and trailed, 61-59, with 23 seconds  left. Fullerton's Rene Arias made two free throws with seven seconds left to  clinch the victory.  </P></p>

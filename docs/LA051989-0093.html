			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Lainie Kazan has left the cast of CBS' fall series "The Incredible Teddy Z"  after taping six episodes, Columbia Television and Kazan's publicist have  confirmed. Kazan, who was cast as the mother of young Hollywood agent Teddy  Zakalakis (John Cryer) in the series from producer Hugh Wilson, quit "because  she did not like the way her character was being written," according to  publicist Jim Dobson. "They wanted her to be an old woman, and she wanted to  play someone younger, more vital." No replacement has been named; Columbia says  it will re-shoot Kazan's scenes in the already-taped episodes.  </P></p>

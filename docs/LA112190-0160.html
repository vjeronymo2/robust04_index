			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> OIL COMPANY PROFITS RISE 1.7%, U.S. SAYS  </P> <P> Profits for major oil companies increased by less than 2% in the months  immediately after the Persian Gulf crisis, and most benefits from higher prices  went to oil-producing countries, the Energy Department reported today.  </P> <P> A report by the Energy Information Administration said higher crude oil prices  "led to substantial increases in income from oil and gas production" but that  the beneficiaries often were foreign governments.  </P> <P> Income for oil-producing countries, as well as for domestic producers, soared  in the third quarter by 684% compared to the same three-month period in 1989,  the report said. But for the most part, the benefit did not pass on to many of  the oil companies, it said.  </P> <P> "For the major petroleum companies, increased profits from oil and gas  production were nearly offset by reduced earnings from refining, marketing and  chemical businesses," the report said.  </P> <P> The net income for major U.S. oil companies was up 1.7% overall. Companies that  had to buy crude oil and petroleum products at the higher prices reported  profit declines, the report said.  </P> <P> Some refineries reported sharp increases in profits, however.  </P></p>

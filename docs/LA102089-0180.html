			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> FOG AIDS PENDLETON FIREFIGHTERS  </P> <P> A thick layer of evening fog gave more than 900 firefighters a respite in their  battle against a stubborn brush fire that broke out two days ago at Camp  Pendleton and had burned into Orange, Riverside and San Diego counties.  </P> <P> "It's just lying real low today," said U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Delores  Fremter. "When the winds kick up in the afternoon, we'll see where it goes."  </P> <P> At mid-morning, firefighters had begun to pull out of the Riverside County  hamlet of Rancho Carrillo, which had been threatened by the fire Thursday  evening.  </P> <P> The blaze had blackened 9,200 acres of tree-studded brushlands. The fog  prevented six air tankers and four water-dropping helicopters from operating  during the night, but they were back in operation after sunrise today, Fremter  said.  </P> <P> Another fire official said the fog and humidity gave firefighters a chance to  contain 30% of the blaze, which was burning generally northeast into the San  Mateo Canyon Wilderness in Riverside County.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 10, 1990, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> COMPUTER FIRMS UNABLE TO AGREE ON SINGLE UNIX SYSTEM  </P> <P> Merger talks have ended between an AT&amp;T unit and a consortium of rival  computer makers developing a different version of an important computer  operating system, the groups said Monday.  </P> <P> The announcement means that two major versions of the Unix operating system  will be promoted in the marketplace.  </P> <P> An operating system is the base layer of software that controls such computer  functions as operating the keyboard and opening files. It differs from  applications programs, which provide such specific uses as word processing or  spreadsheets.  </P> <P> The talks were aimed at merging the American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.  division that develops and sells AT&amp;T's version of Unix with the Open  Software Foundation, a nonprofit company formed by AT&amp;T rivals to promote  another version of Unix. Also included in the merger would have been Unix  International, a group of Unix users set up by AT&amp;T to advise it on Unix  development.  </P> <P> David Tory, president of the Open Software Foundation, said his group entered  into the merger discussions with the expectation that a merged organization  would not be controlled by AT&amp;T or any other company.  </P> <P> "However, an agreement on that principle could not be reached," he said in a  statement.  </P> <P> Peter Cunningham, president of Unix International, said AT&amp;T never proposed  giving itself an upper hand in the merged group. Instead, he said, the talks  collapsed when Open Software Foundation members couldn't solve disputes among  themselves.  </P> <P> AT&amp;T developed Unix 21 years ago, but other computer makers later devised  incompatible variations of it. That means applications software developed for  one version of Unix usually can't be used on a computer running on another  version.  </P> <P> But in announcing that merger talks had broken off, the groups said they had  agreed to adhere to a number of industry standards in developing Unix.  </P> <P> Unix is becoming the operating system of choice as computer companies  increasingly introduce machines that adhere to industrywide standards.  </P></p>

Even now the oblast  administration (which has succeeded in becoming the oblast  government in the interim) is unsuccessfully attempting to evict  several former elected representatives from their official  apartments in St. Petersburg.    Eleven apartments at 10 Yakhtennaya Street were made  available to deputies by a decision of the oblast soviet on 4  September 1991. They were intended for elected officials working  for the oblast soviet on a full-time basis and residing  permanently in the oblast. As noted in the decision, which was  signed by Mr. Yarov, this was intended to be temporary official  housing. Thus it was assumed that during their period of service  as deputies the deputies' own housing would be reserved for them.    After the oblast soviet completed its activities on 16  November it was time for the now-unemployed deputies to go back  home. That is the oblast administration's opinion. However,  according to Mikhail Simanov, chief legal consultant in the  oblast government's legal department, some of the former  deputies continue to occupy apartments in St. Petersburg and  refuse to give them up, basing that position on various  circumstances of a personal nature. As of this time the oblast  government has lodged claims against six former oblast soviet  deputies: Aleksey Vaskov, Oleg Mokhov, Lyudmila Katushonok,  Nikolay Shalonin, Nina Goroshchenko and Svetlana Belyayeva (the  rest have either vacated the apartments after all or else remain  in them on terms satisfactory to the administration).    It appears that the administration does not intend to do any  favors for the deputies, with whom it is commonly known not to  have the most amicable relations. After oral negotiations and  attempts to find a compromise solution produced no results, the  deputies were sent an official letter, in which they and the  members of their family were directed to vacate their official  housing within one month. That deadline expires a few days from  now. It is a possibility that soon there will be a sensational  trial -- the administration is preparing to go to court to  demand the forcible eviction of the former deputies from their  official apartments, an action of which the latter were warned  in the aforementioned letter.    The apartments are not the only object of disagreement  between the oblast government and the former deputies. It seems  that many of Leningrad Oblast's elected officials are attempting  to derive the maximum benefit from their present situation.  Tomorrow Smolninskiy Rayon Court will begin trying another case.  This time the deputies have filed 18 lawsuits against the  administration simultaneously, insisting that they were fired  from their jobs with the soviet in violation of proper legal  procedure.</p>

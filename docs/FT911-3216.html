			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / UK Company News: Amstrad cuts Micron stake to raise Pounds 19m Amstrad, the UK electronics group, has sold part of its stake in Micron Technology, reducing its holding in the US semiconductor manufacturer from 9 to 3.7 per cent. Amstrad said that the sale raised Pounds 19.1m. Amstrad bought its stake in 1988 for Pounds 45m. Last year the UK company recorded an extraordinary charge of Pounds 17.4m to account for the fall in value of its Micron shares. Mr Alan Sugar, Amstrad chairman, said two years ago that the investment had been 'a lousy deal'. He said last month that he intended eventually to dispose of the entire Micron stake. Mr Sugar said the reason for the sale was: 'Cash, me old mate. Dosh.' Amstrad's taxable profits for the first half of 1990-91 rose 33 per cent to Pounds 40.1m. But Mr Sugar has warned that the company will do well to make a profit in the second half. Amstrad bought the Micron stake to ensure a reliable supply of dynamic random access memory (D-Ram) chips, used in the manufacture of its computers. Mr Sugar has since concluded agreements with several semiconductor companies and believes Amstrad will have no difficulty buying the chips it needs.</p>

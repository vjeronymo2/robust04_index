			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Agency warns against Scots water sell-off THE GOVERNMENT has been advised not to privatise the water industry in Scotland, leaving its direction and regulation in the hands of local authorities but allowing the private sector to become involved on a franchise basis. The advice comes from the Commission for Local Authority Accounts, the equivalent of the Audit Commission in England and Wales. It is an independent government-appointed body which watches over local authorities. Its views usually carry weight with government. The commission was responding to the Scottish Office consultation paper on the Scottish water industry, currently run by the nine regional councils and three islands authorities. The paper says change is needed because of the coming reorganisation of local government and to pay for increased investment. The options include outright privatisation. The commission says that because water in Scotland is not seen as a 'commercial' commodity, a 'meaningful' partnership between the public and private sectors is more likely to command public support than privatisation. The private sector could be involved in capital construction projects and in day-to-day running of services. But local authorities should control and regulate the industry, keeping it under democratic control and sending out bills with the council tax. The commission highlights the number of disconnections carried out by English water companies (disconnection is illegal in Scotland) and says: 'It would not be difficult to take the view . . . that the generation of asset and financial resources has featured with undue prominence' (in English water companies). The Scottish Office had received about 3,000 responses to its paper on water when consultation ended on Saturday. Most publicised submissions have been hostile to private ownership of the industry.</p>

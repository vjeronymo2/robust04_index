			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Daily Mail pays Pounds 6.8m for local radio portfolio The Daily Mail and General Trust, owner of the Daily Mail, yesterday increased its presence in commercial radio with the purchase of a portfolio of radio investments previously owned by MAI, the broadcasting and financial services group. The purchase by Harmsworth Media, a subsidiary of Daily Mail and General Trust, was for a total of Pounds 6.8m. MAI had gained the stakes through its purchase of Anglia Television and did not see itself as a player in the radio market. As a result Harmsworth now holds 18.5 per cent of Chiltern Radio, 19.2 per cent of East Anglian Radio and 13.3 per cent of Essex Radio. The company already owned 19 per cent of GWR, the Bristol-based group; 4 per cent of Classic FM, 39 per cent of Radio Trust; a collection of stakes under 10 per cent and 18 per cent of Swansea Sound. At the moment Harmsworth, as the subsidiary of a national newspaper group, is unable to own stakes of more than 20 per cent in commercial radio stations. The government is, however, in the middle of a reviewing cross-media ownership rules and some degree of liberalisation is likely.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Where Is the `Special Inspection' Issue?"] </F>   [Text] The North Korean nuclear issue was caused by the  demand by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] for  special inspections [tukpyol sachal] of the two unreported  facilities [sisol] in Yongbyon, North Korea. Without the two  facilities, the quarrel for the past year over North Korea's  nuclear development would not have occurred. Now when a  conclusion of U.S.-North Korean negotiations on the nuclear  issue is reportedly near-at-hand, the special inspection issue  has been placed outside the argument.    Is the nuclear issue really solved if special inspections  are  not addressed? The third round of U.S.-North Korean talks can  be held, but cannot be considered progress in guaranteeing North  Korean nuclear transparency.    Nuclear inspections by the IAEA begin with specific  inspections [tukchong sachal]. A specific inspection means  confirming a list of nuclear materials reported by a signatory  of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] by comparing it  with an on-the-spot inspection. When the IAEA fulfills a  specific inspection of a NPT signatory, the signatory has to  inform the IAEA of the design of its facilities engaged in  preservation and research of nuclear materials. After receiving  such information, the IAEA installs monitoring video tape  recorders to inspect the facilities. We call this ordinary  inspections [tongsang sachal].    Inspections of only reported facilities are not sufficient  nuclear inspections. The inspection of unreported, suspicious  facilities can help in guaranteeing each country's nuclear  transparency. This is a special inspection. After inspecting a  nuclear waste specimen of North Korea in the course of its  specific and ordinary inspections of the country, the IAEA  suspected that high-density plutonium had been extracted without  being reported. This is why the IAEA wants to see the North  Korean facilities.    The United States said that it had given up the special  inspection of the North Korean nuclear facilities because it  wanted to maintain the continuation of at least ordinary  inspections. It also said that it may find a resolution of  special inspections during the third round of U.S.-North Korean  talks.    Judging from the North Korean attitude shown up to the  present time, I cannot help but point out that there is no  likelihood of the success of the U.S. approach. North Korea  agreed to allow ordinary inspections of its seven reported  facilities and to hold South-North working-level contacts for an  exchange of envoys in return for the resumption of high-level  talks with the United States and suspension of the Team Spirit  exercise. This is nothing but a one-sided concession made by  the United States because it will enable North Korea to assume a  highhanded attitude in South-North working-level contacts  without allowing practical nuclear inspections and to hold  negotiations with the United States on various pending issues --  such as the establishment of diplomatic relations, the issue  concerning light-water reactors, and the issue of signing a  peace treaty -- after the suspension of the Team Spirit exercise.    The United States cannot exercise overall nuclear control  over North Korea by this approach. It is nothing more than  overlooking the nuclear development of unreliable countries. It  will obviously strike a serious blow to the plan for the  limitless extension of the term of the NPT, which is supposed to  expire in 1995. The United States will have difficulties in  leading the new world order of the post-cold war era if it loses  the confidence of Asian countries, which are sensitive to the  nuclear issue.</p>

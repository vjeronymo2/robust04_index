According to him, the Karabakh units holding most of the  heights there did not find it hard 5 days ago to surround and  neutralize a large Azeri army group. "The adventure in  Kelbajar, which pursued largely political goals, turned for  Azerbaijan into pointless losses; over 500 troops got frozen to  death high in the mountains," Ivanian said.    In the meantime the Karabakh army's arsenal was supplemented  with trophies: 12 armored vehicles, including five tanks, two  152-mm self-propelled artillery installations, a jet rocket  system, heavy guns and other military equipment. According to  the general, about 20 Azeri servicemen surrendered. The  Karabakh side lost 3 men; 15 troops were wounded.    The general believes that, having failed to score genuine  success in its two-months-long offensive, Azerbaijan ought to  get convinced once again that "to use the language of force  toward the people of Karabakh" is useless.</p>

			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / International Company News: Strong gaming results lift Hilton Hotels to Dollars 22.2m A TENTATIVE upturn in the fortunes of the beleaguered US hotel and lodging industry was evident yesterday when Hilton Hotels, the California-based chain, announced after-tax profits of Dollars 22.2m in the three months to end-March. This compared with the Dollars 12.3m in the same period a year earlier and was scored on total revenues of Dollars 276.3m - a 4 per cent improvement over the January-March period in 1991. Hilton acknowledged that part of the progress had come from strong results at its Las Vegas-based gaming operations. Operating profits on the gaming side advanced from Dollars 33.7m a year earlier to Dollars 40.8m. The company said the Flamingo Hilton-Reno had realised its first profit for the first quarter, and that a smaller win percentage at the Las Vegas Hilton had been more than offset by a lower bad-debt experience and reduced operating expenses. The group is expanding into riverboat gambling in New Orleans, and has talked of a Dollars 2bn gaming centre in Chicago, although this project faces uncertainties. On the hotels side, Hilton reported operating profits of Dollars 13.2m. This is a considerable improvement on the Dollars 8.5m figure for the previous year, but results in 1991 were badly hit by the Gulf war, which depressed travel generally. However, hotel occupancy rates averaged 62 per cent, compared with 59 per cent a year ago. Commenting on the results, Mr Barron Hilton, chairman, said the group was encouraged by improvements in certain markets such as Hawaii and New Orleans, but the continuing recession and an oversupply of hotel space were still hampering progress.</p>

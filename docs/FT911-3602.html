			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / International Company News: Spanish utilities propose Dollars 5bn power merger THE TWO biggest private sector electricity utilities in Spain, Hidrola and Iberduero, are in 'advanced and serious' negotiations to create a new company that would make it one of Europe's largest private utilities with combined generating capacity of some 14,000MW and a market capitalisation of more than Dollars 5bn. Representatives of the two companies met on Monday with the Ministry of Industry and Energy to discuss the proposals, which could involve a full merger or the creation of a joint holding company. The proposals have been prompted by government plans to radically re-design and streamline the electricity sector. Madrid wants to take the country's 12 generators - most of which also control their own distribution networks - and create just two or three groups. Ideally, it would then hand over nationwide distribution to a single company which would be able to buy electricity from, and sell it to, Spain's neighbours in the European single market after 1992. The big private utilities - Hidrola, Iberduero, Sevillana and Union Fenosa - have become alarmed at the prospect of being pressed by the government into arrangements and mergers that do not suit them. They have been desperately trying to come up with their own plans to pre-empt the government's plans. The commotion sweeping the sector - the second biggest on the Madrid Stock Exchange after the banking industry - has been compounded recently by aggressive corporate raiding by the state-controlled generator, Endesa, the country's biggest generator, from which the private utilities are obliged to buy what they claim is overpriced power. Endesa's acquisitions include 10 per cent of Sevillana, the big Andalucian utility in 1989, and, this year, 80 per cent of Electra de Viesgo in the north, and smaller stakes in Fecsa, the Catalan utility, and Union Fenosa, which also operates in northern Spain. 'This is little more than nationalisation,' said a senior Spanish banker involved in the industry. Spanish banks own stakes in most utilities and vote up to 40 per cent of utility shares using proxy votes at shareholder meetings. Analysts believe Endesa may be accumulating the stakes to get into distribution or to use in an eventual swap of assets which the government might order to facilitate its reorganisation. At the heart of the debate is a highly complex system of compensations erected by the government in 1987 to keep tariffs standard nationwide. This assists high-cost producers by forcing efficient generators to distribute a share of their income around less fortunate operators. Endesa, probably reflecting government plans, says it wants three groups created, with Hidrola and Iberduero and itself leading them. This would leave Endesa free to take control of Sevillana, Fecsa and Union Fenosa. A combined Hidrola and Iberduero, which would bring together Iberduero's strong hydro-electrical assets and more modern conventional generating plant at Hidrola, would pose a strong industrial threat to Endesa's vision. Combined generating capacity would be close to that of the newly-created PowerGen in the UK. Total shareholder equity in Hidrola and Iberduero would be more than Pta1,000bn (Dollars 9.2bn), compared with the Endesa group's current Pta472bn. Combined long-term debt, though, would total Pta1,300bn, against Endesa's current Pta450bn. The Energy Ministry, which is designing a new national energy tariff plan to coincide with the reorganisation of the sector in the next few months, could block a merger simply by threatening it with unprofitable compensation arrangements even though it seems unlikely to drop its unified tariff. Madrid, however, is loathe to be seen to be over manipulative of private sector companies and may give it the green light if, in return, shareholders in Sevillana, Fecsa and Union Fenosa can be persuaded to ease Endesa's entry as the other main controlling force in the sector.</p>

			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Gatwick rail ticket sales are probed The rail industry regulator is investigating claims that arrangements for selling tickets at Gatwick Airport station discriminate against some of the train operators involved, it emerged yesterday. This is the first investigation by Mr John Swift QC, the rail regulator, under rules for the privatisation of the network. His decision could have far-reaching implications for the rival railway companies which are expected to take over the running of former British Rail operations during the next two years. Three companies run trains from Gatwick station to central London. Gatwick Express runs a dedicated service between the airport andLondon Victoria; Network SouthCentral runs between London and the south coast; and Thameslink runs services between Brighton and Bedford via London Bridge. Passengers travelling through Gatwick have complained about confusion over the sale of tickets, saying it is not always possible to compare the prices and times of the competing companies. The regulator's office said it was 'undertaking inquiries to establish the facts following a number of representations from train-operating companies'. The regulator has a duty to see that companies which operate stations do not discriminate against other train operators using their stations. It can order a station operator to remedy activities thought to discriminate and, if action is not taken, impose a fine. The Office of Franchising Director, responsible for selling rail franchises, said it had asked the regulator to clarify arrangements for selling tickets at Gatwick station a month ago. 'It was important to clarify the position before franchises are sold off,' the franchising director's office said. 'Tickets should be sold impartially. We welcome the regulator's review.' Gatwick Express, which is expected to be one of the first train-operating units to be franchised to the private sector, and Network SouthCentral declined to comment. Thameslink was not available for comment last night. The rail regulator's office said: 'We are poring over it. Hopefully a decision will not take much longer.'</p>

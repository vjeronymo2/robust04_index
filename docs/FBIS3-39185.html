			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Ingrid Hedstrom report: "Swedish Ultimatum"] </F>   [Text] Brussels -- European Affairs Minister Ulf  Dinkelspiel is now delivering an ultimatum on regional policy in  the EU [European Union] negotiations. Without satisfactory  support for Norrland there will be no agreement and no  referendum.    "Without a satisfactory solution involving a recognition of  the special problems of Norrland and special support for  Norrland, there will be no agreement. We would then not have  anything to vote on."    So said Ulf Dinkelspiel yesterday in Brussels after a  negotiating round in which the EU's ministers had given the  thumbs-down to Norrbotten. Norrbotten is too rich to qualify  for the Objective 1 support for the EU's poorest regions, the EU  ministers declared.    "I think that the situation is serious. But it is too early  to talk about an out-and-out crisis, because we have agreed to  continue the negotiations," said Ulf Dinkelspiel, who by his own  admission "thumped the table pretty thoroughly" on the subject  of regional policy.    "They cannot have failed to see that I was in deadly  earnest," he said.    The EU side's message is that Norrbotten has so large a  gross  national product, GNP, per inhabitant that Objective 1 support  is out of the question. Instead it takes the view that Sweden  could aim for a solution that is based on two other regional  objective classifications in the EU, the so-called Objective 2  and Objective 5b classifications.    But Sweden's negotiators say no to this.    "Objective 2 and Objective 5b are defined as support for  regions in industrial decline and support for agricultural  development and this does not properly cover the situation in  northern Sweden," Ulf Dinkelspiel said.    "For example, they do not cover the need for infrastructure  investments in northern Sweden."    At the meeting, the Swedish negotiators argued that northern  Sweden has special problems that are overlooked by the GNP  criteria the EU uses in its calculations. It is a question of a  severe climate, sparse population, and great distances. They  pointed out, for example, that the region, which receives  Swedish support, covers an area that is 10 times the size of  Belgium, but that has a population no bigger than that of the  Belgian city of Liege.    In a diplomatic offensive over the last few weeks, the  Swedish negotiators have tried to hammer this message home to  the EU side's negotiators. But if their message has -- in Ulf  Dinkelspiel's words -- "not fallen wholly on stony ground," it  has clearly not hit fully home.    What Sweden wants is an "Objective 1-like solution" where  the  actual label used is not so important. One proposal for such a  solution, a special Arctic regional fund, has been put forward  by Germany and Greece, but so far it has been shot down by the  other EU countries.    But the tough stances voiced yesterday are merely the  initial  bids in the negotiations on regional policy. What will happen  in the future remains to be seen.    Yesterday's negotiations also touched on agriculture.  Sweden's negotiators tabled demands that Sweden be allowed to  continue to give special support to Norrland's farmers and that  the EU should contribute to this over and above the agricultural  support to disadvantaged regions already contained in the EU's  rules. Ulf Dinkelspiel also voiced Sweden's dissatisfaction  with the proposed milk and sugar quotas which have not yet been  officially presented to Sweden.</p>

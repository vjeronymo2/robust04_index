			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / International Company News: Euro Disney posts loss of FFr492m in quarter EURO DISNEY, which has been plagued by problems since the opening of its EuroDisneyland theme park outside Paris last spring, yesterday disclosed that it made a net loss of FFr492m (Dollars 92.4m) in the first quarter of the current financial year. The results, announced little more than a week after the resignation of Mr Robert Fitzpatrick as chairman, were worse than analysts expected and confirmed fears that Euro Disney will make a sizeable loss this year. The company's shares rose FFr2.70 to FFr67.20 yesterday. Euro Disney had budgeted for a seasonal fall in attendance at EuroDisneyland during the period from October to December. But the actual number of visitors is believed to have been even lower than its original estimates, despite a busy Christmas period. The shortfall also affected revenue from merchandise sales and hotels, one of which has been closed since the autumn. As a result, overall revenue reached FFr944m during the quarter. Although Euro Disney refuses to give specific figures, it has admitted that the total number of visitors for the first year will be below its original 11m target. Ms Rebecca Winnington-Ingram, leisure analyst at Morgan Stanley in London, said the company would be 'hard pushed to reach 10m'. Lex, page 20</p>

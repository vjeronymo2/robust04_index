			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Letter: Lean burn ignored Sir, Concluding his article, 'The lion sleeps tonight' (March 26), Joe Rogaly assets, gratuitously, that the government is 'running down an industry that, on environmental grounds, should be written off by the turn of the century'. This completely overlooks the existence of the technology to burn coal much more efficiently to produce electricity, with significantly reduced environmental damage. Practical implementation of this was blocked during the 1980s by the government's refusal to authorise the very modest finance for 'lean burn'. Ivor Bufton, 50m Kelmscott Road, Birmingham B17 8QN</p>

Bd. 2001 Y65000.0 RESULTS DUE Kingfisher, the retailing group, is likely to add its voice to tidings of depressed consumer spending when it releases its interim results on Tuesday. The B&amp;Q chain has faced pressure from a price war in the DIY trade, but Woolworths, Comet and Superdrug should have benefited from productivity gains. Kingfisher has a knack of exceeding expectations and may report pre-tax profits above the Pounds 61m consensus forecast and last year's Pounds 62.5m. Dalgety today reports profits for the year to end June. Forecasts centre on Pounds 115m pre-tax, up from Pounds 110.9m, with petfoods and snacks leading the way. Tougher trading conditions in milling, baking, food ingredients and animal foods are expected though. Inchcape, the international motor distribution, services and marketing group, is today expected to announce interim pre-tax profits of about Pounds 110m, compared with Pounds 91m. The figures are helped by the inclusion for the first time of Tozer Kemsley &amp; Millbourn, the motor company acquired with the help of a Pounds 376m rights issue last December. Tomorrow sees interim results from MB-Caradon, the building products and cheque printing group which has a quarter share in CarnaudMetalbox. Pre-tax profits are expected to have risen from Pounds 47.2m to Pounds 60m, helped by the use of the rights issue money raised last year and substantial cost-cutting measures. Arjo Wiggins Appleton, the Franco-British paper group, also reports on Tuesday. Estimates for interim pre-tax profits range from Pounds 92m to Pounds 100m, compared with Pounds 135.5m. Analysts will ask about the extent to which AWA, a pulp buyer, has suffered from rising pulp costs and falling paper prices. First-half results from Guinness on Thursday are expected to reflect economic weakness in its international markets. Analysts have trimmed forecasts of pre-tax profits to between Pounds 360m and Pounds 365m, an increase of 4 per cent on the 1991 interims. Full-year profits are still expected to top Pounds 1bn for the first time.</p>

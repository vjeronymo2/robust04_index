			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Government Bonds: Bank sets date for extra-long gilts auction THE Bank of England's expected auction of extra-long dated gilts was announced yesterday, the first such securities to be issued since the UK government became a net buyer of gilts in the 1980s. The Pounds 2.5bn of 25-year gilts to be offered on April 29 will mark the first auction of the current financial year, an important moment psychologically given the high level of funding needed to be completed this year. The bonds are expected to be taken up mainly by UK insurance companies, which until now have had no opportunity to buy long-dated paper to match their liabilities. UK investors reacted positively to news of the announcement, although they remain cautious about the short-term outlook for the gilt market in the wake of last week's strong post-election rally. A fixed income manager at one of the UK's biggest fund management groups, who declined to be named, said: 'We're very pleased. There has been an anomaly in the UK yield curve. The government's buying of gilts had created a quite massive distortion.' However, insurance companies said that they would have to consider their involvement carefully. 'We're not going to charge in indiscriminately and push yields down,' said Mr David Shaw, head of fixed income at Legal &amp; General, the insurance group. Two factors would determine his group's interest in next week's auction, he said: the relative attraction of the UK market immediately ahead of the auction, and the likely future supply of securities at the extra-long end of the market. Expectations of substantial further funding at this maturity later in the year, which could force yields up, are likely to prompt some investors to hold back at this stage. Concern about the supply of new gilts due to come on to the market, and weakness in the US government bond market, had combined to drive prices of existing gilts down by around half a point from last Thursday's close in early trading yesterday. However, foreign buying during the afternoon was credited with aiding a partial recovery in prices to just below their Thursday levels. The 9 per cent gilts maturing in 2011 were trading at around 99 5/16 late yesterday afternoon, compared with a close of 99 17/32 on Thursday, while the 9 3/4 per cent securities due 2002 were  3/16 lower than their Thursday close at 103 3/4 . Long gilt futures on Liffe, meanwhile, ended close to the day's high at around 98 21/32 . See Lex US Treasury prices were in mixed form yesterday as the short end of the market staged a modest recovery from Monday's big losses on news of a smaller-than-expected budget deficit for March. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  5/32 at 99 9/16 , yielding 8.033 per cent. At the short end of the market prices were slightly higher, with the two-year note up  3/32 at 100, yielding 5.353 per cent. The market nose-dived on Monday because of reports from the previous week which suggested that economic activity in the US was picking up. With nothing to change that view, yesterday's gains were consequently fitful, although some traders reported that European investors, who were on holiday on Monday, returned to work as buyers of US Treasuries, seeking to take advantage of the big drop in prices while they were away. While the short end was buoyed by the report that the March budget deficit was Dollars 49.36bn, below forecasts and thus good news for inflation, sentiment at the long end was affected by imminent supply pressures, with the Treasury scheduled to sell Dollars 14.75bn in two-year notes and Dollars 10.25bn in five-year notes this week. A DECISION by the Japanese Ministry of Finance on Tuesday to delay its next auction of 10-year bonds seemed to achieve the exact opposite of what was intended: by unsettling the bond market, it pushed yields higher and left observers nervous about the coming weeks. After five interventions by the MoF to buy bonds in the market in the past fortnight, the delay was seen as a sign that these purchases had not worked, and that few options for supporting prices remained. The yield on the benchmark bond 129 reached 5.625 per cent during London trading yesterday, up sharply from the 5.46 per cent yield recorded towards the end of last week. TRADING was quiet as European bond markets resumed after the Easter break. Prices were generally marked down in reaction to weakness in the US at the start of the week. In Germany, the benchmark unity bond due 2002 closed on a yield of 7.94 per cent, up from 7.88 per cent last Thursday. The bund futures contract on Liffe traded in a narrow range between 87.76 and 88.88, eventually ending the day at 87.85.</p>

			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON THE OFFBEAT: WORLD BEAT COLLECTIONS -- STRIKING THE RIGHT NOTES  </P> <P> Quiz time: What do the major pop music styles of Colombia sound like?  </P> <P> Who are the big names on the Kenyan pop scene these days?  </P> <P> What exactly is Bhangra pop, anyway?  </P> <P> Most pop music fans don't exactly have those answers on the tip of their  tongues. But adventurous listeners could find out by checking into the various  artist compilations that are the focus of this edition of "On the Offbeat," a  periodic review of roots, ethnic and non-mainstream pop music from around the  globe.  </P> <P> Those samplers are often perfect for finding out if a particular style or the  music of a certain country or region hits the spot. It's possible to explore  the historical roots of a contemporary style or discover a favorite label,  producer, or crack team of session musicians to keep tabs on.  </P> <P> Then there are the unknown artists who unexpectedly pop up. Take the "Nairobi  Beat" album -- the Maroon Commandos were an unknown quantity but "Amua  Nikuiachie Kazi" certainly whets the appetite for more from the Kenyan Army's  7th Battalion band.  </P> <P> </P> <P> COLOMBIAN "Cumbias Y Gaitas Famosas de Colombia, Vols. 1-3" Discos Fuentes  (Colombian imports) "Fiesta Vallenata" Shanachie  </P> <P> Typical -- no one paid any attention to Colombian pop music for years and  suddenly records are all over the place. "Fiesta Vallenata," part of  Shanachie's exemplary World Beat/Ethno Pop series, focuses on the  accordion-driven regional style from Colombia's Caribbean coast. The sprightly  sound, with swirling accordion lines, propulsive percussion and often wild bass  lines that obey a crazed logic of their own, has much of the festive flavor of  norteno music.  </P> <P> The "Cumbias Y Gaitas" series is more intriguing. Volume 3 is split evenly  between the two styles -- cumbias, the major indigenous rhythm developed in  Columbia, dominates its slightly more upbeat gaita offspring on the other  collections. The tracks probably date from the late '50s or early '60s -- some  have a loopy energy and percussive undertow redolent of Jamaican ska and others  a big band sound evoking images of a Ricky Ricardo-style conga line snaking  around the dance floor.  </P> <P> It's vibrant dance music featuring anything from accordion and blowsy trombones  to high-flying clarinets and a raucous electric rhythm guitar on "La  Magadalena." Vocal tracks are featured on Vol. 1, instrumentals prevail on the  other two albums and Volume 2 emerges as the best single collection courtesy of  its powerful opening punch of "Cumbia Cienaguera," "Cumbia Campesina," and "La  Magdalena." But grab any you see -- Discos Fuentes reportedly stopped selling  these albums overseas to focus attention on more recent releases.  </P> <P> </P> <P> AFRICAN "The Nairobi Beat: Kenyan Pop Music Today" Rounder  </P> <P> A professor of cultural anthropology compiled this collection and most of the  first side sounds like it. The music may be representative of Kenyan pop styles  -- which echo the lightly textured, multiple guitar sound of the popular  Zairian sound -- but the clinical performances lack the sparkle and excitement  pop fans cherish.  </P> <P> That lasts until the Maroon Commandos kick into 8 1/2 minutes of biting  guitars, evocatively rough vocals and delightful horns that unexpectedly enter  halfway through the arrangement. "The Nairobi Beat" never loses that momentum,  with particularly strong performances by the Gatundu Boys and the Mayanja  Bungoma Jazz Band standing out.  </P> <P> </P> <P> LATIN AMERICAN "We Got Latin Soul," "Latino Club!" Caliente/Charly (UK imports)  </P> <P> The Latin pop/salsa spectrum has received short shrift in the world music surge  but now Charly -- the English label whose blues/soul/R&amp;B re-issues have  been invaluable -- has inaugurated its Caliente subsidiary. "Latin Soul"  focuses on material from the '60s, when Ray Barretto's "El Watusi" and Joe  Cuba's "Bang Bang" hit the pop charts with a compact riff/hook, vocal chant and  percussion break format. "Latino Club!" was assembled by British club deejays  and features '70s material more oriented toward instrumental solos flashing  over potent dance grooves. Both are solid -- the choice really boils down to  individual preference for tight songs or more expansive instrumental work.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CARIBBEAN "Port of Spain Shuffle," "Caribbean Connections" New Cross (UK  import)  </P> <P> These volumes capture the West Indian calypso performers, including the notable  veterans Lord Kitchener and Lord Beginner, who adapted their sunny, tropical  sound and topical commentary to life in Great Britain after migrating there in  the late '40s and early '50s. Despite such well-known tracks as Lion's "Ugly  Woman" and the original of "Man Smart and Woman Smarter" (recorded by Robert  Palmer years ago), "Port of Spain Shuffle" is weaker. The old-timey flavor of  the arrangements suffer in contrast with the snappier, jazz-infused music on  "Caribbean Connections." Some highlights there: "Nora, I Will Die a Bachelor,"  and "Calypso Be," Young Tiger's articulately stated put-down of the be-bop  brigade.  </P></p>

			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / MP warns of pension shortfall Savings from equalising the state pension age at 65 should be used to meet the costs of long-term care, Mr Frank Field, the Labour MP who chairs the cross-party Commons social security committee, said yesterday. But he warned that even diverting most of this amount would not cover the whole cost of nursing-home care in the longer term. He hinted that a move to an even higher retirement age might be necessary. 'Raising the retirement pension age to 67 in 40 years' time to help meet additional costs which will then have to be met doesn't look like a policy which can be ruled out of court without the most careful consideration,' he told a seminar on long-term care organised by Prudential, the UK's largest life insurer. He said the equalisation savings - expected to amount to about Pounds 4bn in the years to 2025 - could be reallocated within the social security budget to provide a long-term care pension, a more generous level of invalid care allowance and more comprehensive respite care. The new pension would be directed at people needing residential or home long-term nursing care, and would become available on the basis of a doctor's recommendation. The seminar also heard estimates of the future cost of long-term care drawn from work by the Institute of Actuaries. This suggested that in 1991 the cost of care financed privately was Pounds 3.5bn, that funded by the state Pounds 6.5bn, and that provided informally by family and friends Pounds 30bn. The total cost in 2031, however, was estimated to be at least Pounds 60bn, and possibly Pounds 100bn. The scope for more care to be provided informally was limited, leaving a steep rise in the care to be financed by public and private means.</p>

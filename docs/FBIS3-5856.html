The  ministry plans to connect its Communications Research Laboratory  (CRL) (located in Koganei City, Tokyo) with the Nippon Telegraph  and Telephone Corporation (NTT), Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co., Ltd.  (KDD), and domestic computer makers via this network. The  ministry also plans to invite overseas research institutions to  participate in the project which will be promoted in response to  a similar project underway in the United States, called the  National Research and Education Network (NREN) project. The  U.S. project links universities and research institutions  throughout the nation. It has now become clear that as core  projects which will serve as the basis for the multimedia age,  both Japan and the United States plan to place emphasis on the  construction of communications networks which link research  institutions together.    The planned network is to consist of a massive fiber optical  network capable of transmitting a maximum 10 giga-bits of data  per second, coupled with the latest ATM (asynchronous  transmission mode) converters designed to handle such data.  This is 66 times the maximum amount of data the NTT is capable  of transmitting via its communications networks which are  currently in service. These have a maximum transmitting  capacity of 150 mega-bits per second.    The network is to connect the MOPT's CRL with the NTT's  Communications Network Research Laboratory (CNRL) (located in  Musashino City, Tokyo), the KDD's KDD Laboratory (located in  Kamifukuoka City, Saitama Prefecture), the Japan Broadcasting  Corporation's (NHK) Broadcasting Technologies Laboratory  (located in Setagaya Ward, Tokyo) and the International  Telecommunications Basic Technologies Research Laboratory (ATR  [expansion unknown], located in Seika-cho, Kyoto), a  government-private corporation. It is expected the network will  also link the CRL later on with research institutions managed by  such computer makers as the NEC Corporation, Fujitsu Ltd., and  IBM Japan.    Calling its project the "Global Giga-Bit Network" (G-Net),  the MOPT plans to broadens its scope to include participation by  foreign research institutions via a super-fast overseas  communications network for the use of which the NTT has signed  an agreement with the American Telephone and Telegraph  (AT&amp;T).    In its project, the MOPT plans to emphasize the testing of  technology for operating and maintaining communications networks  and the development of new ways to use networks by utilizing  supercomputers and databases managed by other facilities. The  development of new uses is expected to cover a broad field  extending from communications uses, such as video conferencing  which features clear video images, and teletherapy, in which  diagnosis is conducted by transmitting video images of medical  information to remote places, to environmental research in which  air pollution and meteorological phenomena are analyzed on a  global scale.    The MOPT plans to spend 488 million yen, as approved in the  third supplementary budget for fiscal year 1993, to improve  computer systems and communications facilities at the CRL. The  NTT will provide large-capacity fiber optic cables free of  charge, while research institutions will set up necessary  facilities on their own. Participating institutions plan to set  up a liaison body and hopefully complete the network by March  1995.</p>

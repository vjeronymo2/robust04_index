			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The required value of ``n'' is obtained by successively evaluating this expression for n = 1, 2, 3, .&blank;.&blank;., until the value of the formula first drops below 0.05. The table in &sect;200.820(e) of the proposed rule was generated using this method.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several points need to be made about the revised table. First, for less than 20 units total, all units would have to be tested to get the desired confidence level. Second, the percentage of units to be tested would decrease with increasing size of the project. Third, it is apparent from the table that for values of ``N'' above 1,006, 5.9 percent of the units would need to be tested.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Lower sample sizes may be attractive because of lower testing costs, but that reduces the assurance that units are not lead-contaminated. The existing procedure does not provide any identifiable level of assurance. Of course, 100 percent assurance can only be achieved by requiring the testing of all the units in a project, at much higher cost.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other Matters <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Environmental Impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with part 50 of this title, which implements section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42 U.S.C. 4332.

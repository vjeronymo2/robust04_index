			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Spring Ram puts blame on accounting rules for fall SPRING RAM, the kitchens and bathrooms group, yesterday announced that pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 36.2m to Pounds 26.2m last year on flat sales of Pounds 193.6m. It blamed new accounting rules, a new mood of conservatism in the accounting profession and a desire to clear up speculation about its practices, hence the haggling with auditors Arthur Andersen. As the interim results, announced in September, showed an Pounds 18.4m pre-tax profit, Mr Bill Rooney, chairman, admitted they might have to be 'revisited' - otherwise the full-year figures show a second-half profit of less than Pounds 8m, down from about Pounds 20m. Mr Rooney said that until very recently the group thought it would make Pounds 39m pre-tax. Then it discovered that other companies were reporting 1992 figures under the new FRS 3 accounting rule. 'From there it escalated. I didn't know about Fred 4 (a draft standard) until last Wednesday morning.' The biggest item in the list of Pounds 12.9m profit reductions made in response to accounting changes was Pounds 5.6m of profits pushed back into 1993. Of this Pounds 4.1m was for the sale of land for retail development - including Ikea and Toys 'R' Us stores. Mr Ron Farr, director of the special products division, said title to the land had changed hands subject to planning permission, which was obtained in January. A deposit had been paid, but not the remainder. Property disposal profits still amounted to about Pounds 2m, down from about Pounds 5m in 1991. The division benefited from increased exports. In kitchens, about Pounds 1.5m of profit was disallowed on sales to distributors who were trying to beat a January price rise. Profits had not been allowed on stock delivered later than January. This was one of the reasons for a Pounds 1.4m fall in operating profit in the division to Pounds 12.1m. Another was that Pounds 4m of product development costs had been put through the profit and loss account rather than capitalised. The bathrooms division fell to a loss of Pounds 4.87m, compared with Pounds 5.02m profit. This included a Pounds 3.06m charge for previously overstated profits at Balterley Bathrooms. Mr David Riley said Spring Bathrooms was also losing money. Savings of Pounds 1.5m were being made in the division's overheads. Reorganisation costs amounted to about Pounds 1m. Other accounting changes affecting the figures were the exclusion of Pounds 1.28m transferred from the revaluation reserve and Pounds 1.4m of government grants. Depreciation of freehold buildings for the first time knocked off a further Pounds 660,000. The group stressed that the 1991 figures were only reduced by Pounds 1.4m following the application of FRS 3. This involved the comparatively small figures in the revaluation transfer and depreciation. After Pounds 31.7m of capital spending and Pounds 15m on buying and absorbing debt in Stag Furniture, the group had Pounds 10m net cash at the year end, down from Pounds 45m. Earnings per share fell to 5p (6.8p). A final dividend of 0.243p makes a total of 0.346p (0.288p). See Lex</p>

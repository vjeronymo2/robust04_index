			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: MB-Caradon The secret of a good investment - as well as a good joke - is timing. It is still uncertain whether MB-Caradon has mastered the art to perfection or fluffed the punch line as it prepares to sell its 25.3 per cent stake in CarnaudMetalbox and reinvest the proceeds. From one perspective, the timing is ideal. Under its new management, CarnaudMetalbox has finally begun to fulfil the merger's original promise. The sterling share price - boosted by the pound's devaluation  - stands at an all-time high. But it would be dangerous for MB-Caradon to hold on too long. CarnaudMetalbox's main markets in mainland Europe are softening. The value of its investment could fall heavily if the franc were devalued. If MB-Caradon can conclude a sale quickly, it will certainly show a tidy gain. Its shareholding has a book value of Pounds 344.4m compared with a market value of Pounds 549m, although shares not taken up by CGIP may have to be placed at a discount in the market. In the short term, at least, a sale is likely to dilute earnings slightly. Longer term, MB-Caradon should obtain a better cash return than the Pounds 7.3m dividend income it received last year. MB-Caradon seems inclined to sink the money into the UK building materials sector. It may have missed its main chance. In the past three months, the sector's shares have climbed 21 per cent in response to lower interest rates. They are likely to climb still higher if a cash-rich MB-Caradon lumbers into view.</p>

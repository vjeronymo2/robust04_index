			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Shell signs Nigerian oil development contract NIGERIA THIS week signed an oil exploration and production contract with the local offshoot of Royal Dutch/Shell, the first in a series of such agreements with foreign oil companies that could increase the country's output to 2.5m barrels a day. The deal marks a welcome success for the Transitional Council, which had pledged to end months of delay over the signing and clear the way for more foreign and private sector investment in the sector. Similar deals are expected shortly with other foreign oil companies, including Elf Aquitaine, Mobil Corporation, Chevron and Agip and with the alliance of Statoil and BP, whose Nigerian assets were nationalised in 1979. If exploration agreements were made for the 65 new areas, it would help Nigeria to hit its target of 25bn barrels of recoverable reserves by 1995 with no initial outlay by the government. Shell has set up a new company for exploration and production in new areas, operating purely as a contractor and taking all the risk in developing five new exploration blocks awarded by the government in December 1991. Under the new agreement, there is no guaranteed minimum nor any upper limit on the foreign operator's earnings. The Nigerian government will receive signature bonuses of Dollars 30m each for licensing the two deep offshore blocks and less than Dollars 1m each for three large onshore permits in the Benue basin. The new terms replace the joint ventures with the state-owned National Petroleum Corporation in which foreign companies hold minority stakes. Shortage of cash recently forced NNPC to cut investment in these ventures. Oil Secretary Mr Philip Asiodu said: 'Exploration sharing is better for Nigeria because we can save scarce funds for more pressing needs'. These include the state monopoly on oil refineries and distribution, which is near to collapse, leading to fuel shortages in most parts of Nigeria. The new signing is also a boost for Shell, the largest foreign investor in Nigeria, which has been caught up in controversy as the technical adviser on the delayed Liquefied Natural Gas project.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Choe Won-ki] </F>   [Text] At the preliminary contact to be made at Panmunjom  on 28 June, the government is going to propose that the summit  talks be held "in Seoul on around 10 July," while putting forth  agenda items on which both the South and North can easily reach  an agreement.    According to government officials concerned, the government  will propose to the North side that the summit talks be realized  in Seoul on around 10 July.    This is based on the judgment that it is good for the  South-North summit talks to be realized right before or after 8  July--the date when the North-U.S. talks are expected to be  held--because the two kinds of talks should go in tandem with  each other.    The government is going to propose Seoul as the venue with  the expectations that if President Kim Il-song has the  opportunity to have the firsthand look at, and feel from, the  South Korean society, the atmosphere for the summit talks will  change.    Meanwhile, the government is planning to have all  things--which the South and North can raise--included in the  agenda items. At the same time, the government will give  priority to those loose items on which the South and North can  easily reach an agreement so that the atmosphere for the talks  may not become rigid.    Saying this regarding the agenda for the summit talks, one  government official concerned said that such items will be  reflecting the spirit and substance of the South-North Basic  Agreement. He said on 24 June: "The government needs a loose  agenda even for a joint statement to be released by the South  and North right after the summit talks. The agenda items for  the summit talks can smoothly be simplified in the process of  keynote speeches by the head delegates to the preliminary  contacts and of follow-up negotiations."    In his keynote speech, Yi Hong-ku, deputy prime minister for  national unification affairs, is going to clarify our position  on the South-North joint declaration of denuclearization; the  implementation of the South-North Basic Agreement; dispersed  families; and economic cooperation between the South and North.</p>

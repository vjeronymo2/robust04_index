			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Ukrainian Presidential Press Secretary Viktor  Stelmakh told UNIAN today that Leonid Kravchuk's stance on the  Crimean elections is a matter of principle and remains  unchanged. The president respects the voters' right to elect  anyone they like, but if the president of Crimea violates the  Constitution of Ukraine, the president of Ukraine will annul  unconstitutional decisions using the extra powers granted by the  parliament.    Vyacheslav Chornovil, chairman of Ukraine's Popular Movement  [Rukh], said in his comment: "What happened had to happen; it is  another loss for Ukraine's leaders. The unconstitutional  presidential elections in Crimea should not have been allowed.  We can only hope that Leonid Kravchuk will remain president of  Ukraine and use the extra powers granted to him to annul the  decisions of the Crimean autonomy.    "I do not see any absolute tragedy here; making speeches is  one thing, pushing a plow quite another. I believe that in 18  months' time the Crimean residents will be disillusioned with  Yuriy Meshkov's policy. Besides, I believe he has given Leonid  Kravchuk an advantage with regard to the statement on Ukraine's  nuclear disarmament, since that document guarantees the  territorial integrity of its signatories."

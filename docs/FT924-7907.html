			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / International Company News: TTL recovers to ADollars 15.2m at end-September TELEVISION and Telecasters (TTL), the holding company for Australia's Channel Ten television network, yesterday announced net profits of ADollars 15.2m (USDollars 10.51m) for the 50 weeks to end-September. The result marks a significant recovery for the network, which went into receivership in 1990 and is now owned by Westpac Banking Corporation, formerly its biggest creditor. Westpac is in the process of completing a deal to sell the network to a consortium led by CanWest Global Communications, a Canadian broadcasting company which also owns a majority stake in New Zealand's TV3 network. TTL, which controls programming for the network and operates three east coast stations, reported a profit of ADollars 28m before interest and tax, representing a gross return of 11 per cent on sales. Mr Gary Rice, managing director, said the result was achieved in spite of difficult trading conditions caused by slow economic growth. He said he was confident the network could maintain its improved performance in the current year.</p>

			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: RJB Mining The 11 per cent cut in the price RJB Mining is paying for English Coal may look like smart haggling. But it makes little difference to its financial prospects. RJB is getting less for less: most of the Pounds 99m reduction can be accounted for by lower stocks and greater liabilities. Admittedly, the lower price allows RJB to cancel its Pounds 100m corporate bond. That, together with the opportunity to defer part of the payment, may help reduce interest payments and improve cash-flow, but only marginally. Until April 1998, when the electricity generators' fixed contracts expire, English Coal will enjoy strong cash flow. By the end of that period, RJB should have paid off its bank debt. The problem for equity investors remains forecasting what happens thereafter. Investors have limited objective advice to call on. There is a dearth of City expertise and the specialist consultants' forecasts diverge considerably. With so much still uncertain, it is unfortunate the gap between the prospectus' publication and the offer's close will be just one week. The company's long-term attraction will be dependent on the accuracy of RJB's ambitious assumptions for volumes and prices after 1998. Much depends on RJB's ability to cut costs sufficiently so it can deliver coal cheaply enough to keep out imports. RJB has proved highly successful at open-cast mining, but its relative inexperience in deep mines is worrying. For equity investors, RJB is a high-risk company. The price, when set, will need to reflect that.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] [Announcer] [passage omitted] Peter Gyuricza and  Edit Schranz report on the day's events at the Hungarian  Democratic Forum [MDF] congress.    [Gyuricza] In the spring of 1989 the sober majority voted  for  pure democracy, and not for anarchy or the patching up of the  defeated system. And the question now is whether democracy will  remain, whether the pure system, whose foundations were laid by  the Hungarian Democratic Forum together with the coalition  partners, will continue, Lajos Fur said, thanking the National  Convention for its trust.    He described fidelity [hueseg] as an important expression of  our day. He recalled that four years ago a promise was made to  remain faithful to the spirit of Lakitelek, to its declaration,  to the MDF. Now there must be a pledge to remain faithful to  the traditions, and at the same time, also to modern democracy,  to social market economy, faithful to social justice, to the  idea of the nation, to Hungarianness [magyarsag], MDF Chairman  Lajos Fur said.    [Schranz] At the news conference tonight, weighing up the  1994 elections, the MDF chairman said it would be ideal if the  party gained as many seats in the parliament as in the 1990  elections. But Lajos Fur also added that he is certain that the  MDF's share in the election will be between 20 and 30 percent.    Sandor Lezsak, MDF deputy chairman and Presidium member,  said  in answer to a question: The MDF will not conclude a coalition  just to be able to take part in government. It seems, continued  the party's executive chairman, that the policies of the  Hungarian Socialist Party and of the Alliance of Free Democrats  are irreconcilable with the MDF's program.</p>

In Tokyo for a two-day quarterly meeting, regional central  bank leaders said recent stock market gains were just reviving  the spirits of corporate managers when Tokyo shares took their  worst dive in two and a half years.    "I'm concerned about the impact on corporate sentiment,  which  had improved a bit recently as the yen stopped its appreciation  and stock prices staged a rally in heavy volume," Osaka branch  manager Tatsuya Tamura told a news conference.    The benchmark Nikkei stock average plummeted about 950  points, or 5 percent, Monday to 18,353.24 in the wake of  Friday's defeat of the political reform bills that Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa had staked his government on.    Some areas, such as export-heavy central Japan that watch  currency rates more than stock prices, are encouraged that the  yen's declines from earlier peaks may improve profits, said  Nagoya Branch Manager Eiichiro Kinoshita.    But on the downside, he said, managers in his area have seen  demand weaken relative to supply.    Overall, economic recovery will likely take time, Central  Bank Governor Yasushi Mieno said in opening the managers'  meeting, but he gave no hint of changing his policy stance,  repeating that he will watch the effects of past fiscal and  monetary actions.    The managers of 33 domestic branches, plus representative  offices in New York, London and Hong Kong, opened their two-day  meeting with reports that the economy remains mired in a slump  with no signs of recovery visible.    Their reports, written before the political turmoil was  unleashed Friday, said further setbacks are unlikely, as the  economy is supported by reviving personal spending in some areas  and improving corporate posture.    Osaka Branch Chief Tamura said his region's report may have  to be revised, including its suggestion to monitor the effects  of past monetary measures.    Mieno, unavailable to spell out his views on the political  turmoil, is to meet the press Wednesday to wrap up the meeting.    The Osaka and Nagoya branch managers said in separate press  conferences that corporate sentiment was brightening, with  Kinoshita saying other managers expressed similar views. But  both said the economic picture was a mix of bright and dark  spots.    "The chances of the economy falling through the bottom have  lessened," Tamura said. "The corporate mind is recovering."    Smaller companies are starting to "take a positive stance  independently" instead of nervously waiting for an economic  recovery predicted by the government, and companies are making  "forward- looking" capital investment in such promising  strategic businesses as multimedia, he said.    Mieno noted the importance of business sentiment, citing a  drag on recovery from caution among companies and financial  institutions, stemming from their stubborn problems in clearing  losses incurred during the asset deflation after the collapse of  the speculative "bubble" of the late 1980s.    Tamura stressed that "dark factors" have grown, expressing  concern that companies are increasingly shifting production  overseas, and saying more time is needed for companies to  improve their balance sheets through restructuring.    Business conditions remain tough for financial institutions  as fund demand stays weak despite low interest rates.    But although economists and business leaders have called for  a cut in the Bank of Japan's already record low official  discount rate of 1.75 percent a year, Kinoshita said fewer  people in his area are now calling for a rate cut, perhaps  reflecting the concerns of people on fixed incomes.    Among the problems around Nagoya, "a setback in the  supply-demand area stands out," as consumer and capital spending  lag. But "the corporate mind is settling down" with a more  bearable exchange rate, he said.    A higher yen hurts Japanese exporters by making their  products more expensive in foreign-currency terms. The yen,  which soared last year to a postwar record 100.40 to the dollar  in August, closed Friday at 112.10 to the dollar.</p>

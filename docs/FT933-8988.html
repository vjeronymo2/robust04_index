			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Investigation clearance for Trafalgar House accountants THE ACCOUNTANTS and auditors involved in the preparation of the controversial 1991 accounts of Trafalgar House have been cleared of any disciplinary action by their professional body. The investigation committee of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales said yesterday that there were no grounds to act against its members, who included four directors of the company, and Touche Ross, the auditor. It said the accounts were prepared after 'appropriate consideration' by the directors, and that the controversy was a function of 'honest differences of professional opinion'. The examination was triggered automatically by a ruling from the Financial Reporting Review Panel, the UK accounts watchdog, which forced the company to restate its 1991 figures in the 1992 accounts. The company reversed its decision to charge a Pounds 102.7m deficit on revaluation of properties directly to reserves rather than against profits, and added back Pounds 20m in advance corporation tax to the original Pounds 40.4m charge. The case was the nearest the review panel has so far come to using its legal powers to take a company to court to force the directors to restate their accounts. After initially refusing to co-operate in a battle with the panel which is believed to have cost the company about Pounds 500,000, Trafalgar House relented last October. It had been heavily criticised by shareholders at its annual meeting, who voted against the reappointment as auditors of Touche Ross, which had given Trafalgar House an unqualified audit report. The decision by the Institute not to take any disciplinary action raises the question of how robust was the review panel's original verdict. But it is believed that the Institute had no information which might have swayed its views on the reasons behind the review panel's ruling beyond the public statements made at the time.</p>

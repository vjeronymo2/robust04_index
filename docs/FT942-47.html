			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cornish tin mine seeks Pounds 1m lifeline as debts forgiven An emotional appeal to investors to provide at least Pounds 1m and up to Pounds 1.8m to save the last operating tin mine in Cornwall - where tin mining has taken place for more than 2,500 years - was made yesterday by Mr Kevin Ross, managing director of South Crofty, until recently known as Carnon Consolidated. 'Since the collapse of the tin price in 1985, most of the world's producers have faced enormous difficulties and many have closed. But South Crofty has survived through tenacity, dedication and ingenuity. On many occasions commentators have predicted that closure of the mine was imminent - but we are still here and, with your help, we intend to stay here,' he says in a letter accompanying the prospectus carrying details of an offer of South Crofty shares. This reveals that, if South Crofty can raise Pounds 1m to ensure its survival for another 18 months, the UK government will waive loans to South Crofty made since 1985 totalling Pounds 23.4m. The European Commission, which approved the loans, has agreed they can now be written off. The government last night confirmed it would waive repayment of the loans. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said in a parliamentary written answer that the low price of tin meant there was no longer any realistic prospect of repayment. He said the conditional waiver was 'intended to permit Carnon the opportunity to raise fresh funding to continue its operations'. Mr Heseltine said the waiver was conditional on the company successfully raising the minimum subscription and on MPs not objecting to it before the closing date on August 4. RTZ, the world's biggest mining company, which sold South Crofty and its sister mine Wheal Jane to management and employees in 1985, will also forgive its loan of Pounds 7.7m. RTZ wrote off this loan in 1986. Mr Ross is asking for minimum individual offers for Pounds 200-worth of shares. He points out that investment in the company is far from a 'safe bet'. South Crofty needs a tin price of about Pounds 4,000 a tonne to make a decent profit. The price peaked at Pounds 10,021 in February 1985 and fell to a 20-year low of Pounds 2,946 in September 1993. At present the price is about Pounds 3,600 a tonne. The prospectus makes no forecasts but shows South Crofty reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 42,000 on turnover of Pounds 6.5m for last year, compared with a profit of Pounds 79,000 on Pounds 6m of sales in 1992. South Crofty employs 260 people and has about three years of demonstrated reserves and at least ten years of identified reserves. Annual output has been 2,200 tonnes of tin in concentrate. Ore is trucked from the South Crofty mine 12 miles to the Wheal Jane mill - 'one of the world's most efficient tin concentrators' - for processing. All concentrate is shipped for refining to the DKS smelter in Malaysia. Annual demand for tin could rise by over 20 per cent in five years as new products come on to the market, according to Mr Bres Barry, director of the International Tin Research Institute, reports Reuter. He said products pioneered by the ITRI could add 35,000 to 40,000 tonnes to annual consumption. Projects under way included a new tin-zinc alloy for plating car components.

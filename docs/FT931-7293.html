			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Accountancy Column: Local authorities called to account in an age of competitive tendering - The new regime for public sector balance sheets THE CHARTERED Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy may not bark often. But its new proposals for capital accounting by local authorities show that when it barks, it roars. And when it roars, it reveals sharp teeth. Public sector treasurers and finance officials can expect a few sleepless nights ahead as they prepare for compliance with Cipfa's recommendations, which are likely to be in force for the 1994-95 financial year and which all will have to obey. For the first time, local authorities will have to compile registers of fixed assets such as schools and equipment. Most will have to be shown on their balance sheets at current cost and regularly revalued. Depreciation charges will then be charged in their accounts based on these amounts. Surprising though it may seem, local authorities have never been required to show fixed assets in their accounts in the past. The emphasis has been on showing outstanding borrowings on assets which were externally financed. Assets financed from internal resources or which are paid for have not been shown. 'Charges at the moment are inconsistent and arbitrary,' says Mr Martin Evans, head of Cipfa's technical division. 'The balance sheet is meaningless. At the moment you are comparing chalk and cheese.' The debate about capital accounting extends as far back as the existence of local authorities themselves. Municipal corporations at the turn of the century were debating the inclusion of depreciation of assets in their accounts rather than focusing simply on loan repayments. But central government was always most concerned with controlling the amount of capital expenditure, says Mr Evans. That was reflected in its primary aim: to control the amount of borrowing. Local authority accounting developed accordingly, emphasising how assets were financed, not what they were or how they were used. He argues that this was the result of a concern to restrict the level of borrowing and enforce repayment of any funds by local authorities - not a concern always shared by national government either in the UK or elsewhere around the world. That has begun to change, with capital accounting now in place in the National Health Service and required by Direct Service Organisations running local authority services as a result of competitive tendering. For the public sector in general, the most radical changes in accounting have only really happened in the last 15 years. Few have been as fundamental as this week's proposals, for which the immediate groundwork was laid nearly 10 years ago after a succession of previous reports which were issued and largely ignored. Shortly after the Conservative government's election in 1979, Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, told a House of Commons select committee that the quality of public sector accounting was 'abysmal'. He began an assault on accounting and auditing which led to the creation of the Audit Commission, the National Audit Office and the Financial Management Initiative, designed to improve accountability in central government. The 1980 local government land and planning act required authorities to issue annual reports for the first time. But when the first reports came in, they only made clear to officials how impossible it was to compare the different figures. By 1985, the government was threatening to impose detailed new accounting regulations. In the face of strong opposition, it allowed the Audit Commission and Cipfa to draft a code of practice, which was endorsed by the Accounting Standards Committee in 1987. But Mr Evans says the guidelines essentially represented a codification of existing best practice rather than any significant change. Most important, it did not cover capital accounting - a problem identified in a letter to Cipfa from Mr Nicholas Ridley, the environment secretary at the time. 'We took the letter seriously,' says Mr Evans. 'Perhaps we should not have done so.' A joint Cipfa and local authority working group studied the issue yet again, and came up with recommendations in 1990. Its proposals included showing fixed assets on the balance sheet at current costs, with regular revaluations at least every five years. The result, says Mr Evans, was that 'all hell broke loose.' Local authorities expressed concern over the costs, practicability and timing of the guidelines. But few could criticise the technicalities of its recommendations. Their primary concern was the difficulty and costs involved in changing their accounting systems, and paying for regular revaluations of fixed assets. As a result, the threat of change was again prolonged. Cipfa ran a pilot programme in Solihull metropolitan borough council to study the potential impact of the new proposals, as well as smaller field tests in Croydon and Bury St Edmunds. The results were staggering. Solihull had previously shown fixed assets in its balance sheet of Pounds 117m. Under the proposed system, these rose more than five-fold to Pounds 588m. Yet at the same time, the costs and time involved in implementation were not that significant - a total of 241 staff days. That was possible partly because much of the information on assets was already available although never before collected centrally. The council also did not attempt to identify every last immaterial asset, and was able to apply standardised valuation procedures without the need to separately value each one. Cipfa will not release the costs incurred by Solihull, but estimates that the total one-off charges for changing to the new system will be Pounds 6m for England and Wales, and a further Pounds 1m for local authorities across Scotland. There would then be about Pounds 1m across the UK each year for revaluations. The relatively minor difficulties identified seem to stand in stark contrast to the costs experienced by implementation at short notice of the same accounting treatment by the National Health Service, partly incurred by its efforts to attempt to track down assets even with very low values. After the consultation period closes in April, it is likely that Cipfa's guidelines - which have mandatory status - will be on schedule to be implemented from next year. But many might question the relevance of the changes. 'We think getting accounts right is important,' says Mr Evans. 'Accountability is at the heart of the public sector. Authorities should be demonstrating not just stewardship of assets but also how they are used.' Most important, he stresses that inclusion of assets and a depreciation charge against them will improve the quality of management. 'If you don't have to pay for assets you are not going to worry about how you use them,' he says. 'This will highlight the real costs of services. It brings local authorities as close into line with private sector practice as we can get.' The principal differences now between public and private sector will prove more difficult to change, since they are products of legislation restricting local authority accounting. These include the treatment of the housing revenue account. Whether or not it was part of the reason for the change, the move to capital accounting will certainly aid comparisons in the move towards compulsory competitive tendering by local authorities. It may also allow a few more readers to make sense of the accounts for the first time.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Power does not interest me. This is what the  commander in chief of the Haitian Army, General Raoul Cedras,  stated during an interview by LUMIERE NOIRE magazine. In this  interview, the head of the Haitian Army recounted the facts  which allegedly led to the 30 September [1991] coup d'etat.  [words indistinct] to explain [words indistinct] that President  Aristide had stirred up. He has always tried to push the  institutions to the limit through the streets in order to get  rid of any counterpower, eliminate some people, and terrorize  possible opponents. He has always been a leftist militant. Even  after he came to power through election, he was not able to  differentiate between his revolutionary fervor and his new  status as head of state, states Gen. Cedras, who advances three  reasons for the attitude of the international community after  the coup d'etat:    The principle of respect for elections means that if a  president has been elected, he has the right to (?fulfill his  mandate until it expires). He left on 30 September [1991]. The  OAS immediately met to condemn Haiti without analyzing the  situation first. I have noted that all the presidents who urged  the OAS to take those measures -- Perez of Venezuela, for  example -- were members of Socialist International, Gen. Cedras  explained.    The third reason put forward by the head of the Haitian Army  is solidarity among presidents because, even though there are  three powers in a state of law, it is nevertheless the executive  that prevails, Gen. Cedras explained.    Gen. Cedras says he is not in power. I am not at all  interested in assuming power; I rely on the men of this country  to find a solution. Power for power's sake is not an end in  itself, but implies first the sense of responsibilities. In this  conversation with LUMIERE NOIRE, Gen. Cedras also advocated the  creation of a political center. It will be necessary, Gen.  Cedras said, for the middle classes to take charge of (?one  another), to play a political role in the noble sense of this  word, to ally themselves in promoting a candidate of consensus  and progress with a precise agenda and who can establish the  sense of state, of national interest; all that would put an end  to the personal ambitions of some and the external interferences  of others. We must give rise to the emergence of a middle class  that will be able to assume legitimately a new democratic power  cleansed of all excesses.    Gen. Cedras appeals to the conscience of international  opinion, of all honest democrats who have been misinformed. The  truth is that in Haiti we had an electoral coup d'etat [words  indistinct] through the ballot and opposed to any kind of  organization and to all institutions lacking an agenda, lacking  a code of ethics, and whose sole policy is to sow division and  to give rise to hatred among the various components of the  population by inciting [people] to murder, Gen. Cedras explained.    In the same magazine there is an interview with former  Haitian President Leslie Francois Manigat, who spoke of an  international coup d'etat within the scope of the situation in  Haiti.</p>

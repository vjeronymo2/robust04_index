			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Thai loan rate cut may hit bank profits THAILAND's commercial banks started to raise deposit interest rates and lower the cost of loans this week, raising the spectre of declining profits for an unusually successful near-cartel of 15 commercial banks. The Bangkok Bank, the Thai Farmers bank and the Krung Thai bank trimmed their minimum retail rate (the rate charged to good small customers) by  1/4 of a percentage point to 11 3/4 per cent with most of the others expected to follow suit shortly. Unusually these banks also increased deposit rates: the Bangkok Bank raised fixed deposit rates by  3/4 of a percentage point after admitting that deposits declined by Bt1.2bn (Pounds 32m) in the first two months of this year. Bangkok Bank said the rearrangement would squeeze its interest rate spread from 3.5 per cent to 2 per cent, and would cost the company around Bt400m this year. Similarly Thai Farmers bank increased, for example, 3-month deposit rates by  1/4 of a percentage point to 7 per cent as part of a total adjustment costing Bt200m. The move will appease the Bank of Thailand which last year watched with horror as money became cheaper but interest rates charged to small customers remained high. However, Mr George Morgan, head of research for HG Asia in Bangkok, said 'banks had to do this because credit growth has been much quicker than deposit growth. There is a lot of window dressing going on here - the Bangkok Bank's three month deposits under Bt1m in Bangkok are not being adjusted at all, for example.' The central bank devised the MRR - comprising deposit rates plus administration costs plus a profit margin - last October as the rate to be charged good retail customers. Typically this was 7% plus 2% plus 2% to give a target of 11% or a bit higher for the MRR over the longer term.</p>

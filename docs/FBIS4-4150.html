			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, April 28 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher, now on a visit to Egypt, said today that the  Palestinian-Israeli negotiations on the implementation of  Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and Jericho have achieved some  progress.    At a press conference given jointly by Christopher and  Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat following their meeting with  Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa, Christopher pointed out  that the two sides are proceeding on the road of reaching an  agreement on the implementation of the PLO-Israeli peace accord.    The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and Israel  signed  the peace accord in Washington on last September 13, which  provides for Palestinian autonomy in the occupied obt bank's [as  received] Jericho area.    Christopher said this was a chance "for the people of Gaza  and Jericho to experience for the first time an opportunity to  manage their own lives, something comparable to the thrilling  experience we're seeing today in South Africa."    He underlined the need to end this phase and start  implementing the peace accord.    Those who want to hinder the peace process will have no  better alternatives, he added.    Christopher said that during his meeting with 'Arafat he  found a common ground to move forward.    He said progress in the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks has  been furthered by the arrival Wednesday [27 April] of the first  batch of the cars offered as a grant by the U.S. to the  Palestinian police.    The cars are only part of the assistance pledged by donor  countries to the Palestinians, he added.    Christopher reiterated the importance of further moving  forward. He said he was heartened by the reports he had received  from the peace negotiating parties over the past six months.    The U.S. official affirmed his country's keenness on  encouraging all parties to move on toward a more advanced stage.    'Arafat said he hoped that an agreement would be reached  within an overall settlement of the Middle East dispute on all  tracks.    "We hope to overcome the obstacles still hindering reaching  a  Palestinian-Israeli agreement," he added.    'Arafat emphasized that the Palestinians are well prepared  to  sign an agreement on enforcing the PLO-Israeli peace accord as  soon as the obstacles are eliminated.</p>

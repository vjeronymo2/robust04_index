The newspaper points out that under present conditions the  CIS Interparliamentary Assembly "will hardly play the political  role which was assigned to it by former speaker of the Russian  parliament Ruslan Khasbulatov.    In the opinion of the newspaper, "The CIS Interparliamentary  Assembly is most likely to transform from a high-aiming agency  into yet another CIS show helping the new and old speakers to  stay aware of their political significance".    KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA frontpages an article headlined "A  Disintegration Process in Russia's Nuclear Power Industry Is  Under Way".    According to the newspaper, the fuel reserves at such major  Russian nuclear power stations as the Smolensk and Leningrad  ones will suffice for 11 and 14 days respectively. If nothing  changes, electric power will be supplied to central Russia only  for several hours a day, the newspaper cautions.    "Last year, Russia's nuclear power stations, according to  international organisations, operated more reliably than those  of the United States and France," the writer of the article  pointed out.    "It was necessary, it would seem. To support our nuclear  power industry. Instead, it has been subjected to large-scale  experiments", with the necessary funds not being assigned, the  author of the article writes, recalling that nuclear power  stations supply electricity to Moscow, St. Petersburg, and  practically the entire south-western region of Russia.    KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA carries an interview with President  Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan who dwelt on economic  problems and migration processes.    Nazarbayev remarked that he is worried at the outflow of  ethnic Germans from the republic. "I understand the feelings of  people who seek to return to their historical homeland, the more  so as most of them had arrived in Kazakhstan not of their own  will. But during talks with the leaders of Germany I always  raise matters aimed at expanding the presence of German business  in Kazakhstan", Nazarbayev said.    Speaking about relations with Russia, Nazarbayev said the  two  countries are equally interested in meeting their commitments.  Treaties on military cooperation and joint space projects are  now in the works, he added.    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA frontpages an article about the course  of  investigation of the case involving participants in the October  events of last year in Moscow. The investigation concerning  former Vice-President Aleksandr Rutskoy, just as all the other  arrested after the September-October crisis, is proceeding  agonisingly slowly, the writer of the article maintains.    "Virtually, the charge against Rutskoy is based on his only  phrase urging people to seize the Moscow mayor's office and the  Ostankino Television centre," the author of the article points  out. The journalist believes that the proceedings are being  dragged out while the election campaign promises by many a  member of the State Duma about their intention to set up special  parliamentary commissions to inquire into the case proved  unfulfilled.    "One can suppose that the 'Octobrists' case' will hardly be  examined by a law-court this year. Upon playing its election-  campaign role, the case is most likely to surface again only  when the time will come for yet another election campaign," the  journalist concludes.    TRUD reports that last year Russian customs houses prevented  the smuggling of valuables, worth about 110,000 million roubles,  out of the country. "The customs services confiscated 4,000 art  object and antiques, and more than 50,000 firearms," the  newspaper said.    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR), commenting on Russian Defence  Minister Pavel Grachev's tour of units of the Privolzhskiy  military district, points out that such trips are prompted by  the fact that "it is urgently necessary to check on the spot the  possibility of implementing the new ideas inherent in the  military doctrine".    PRAVDA announces that President Boris Yeltsin will soon  deliver a report to the Federal Assembly on the country's  national security strategy.    In this connection the newspaper runs one of the alternative  projects drawn up by a group of independent experts. The  project was prepared with an eye to a national doctrine in this  respect.    The drafters of the project believe that "preventing a civil  war, strengthening state institutions, precluding a break-up of  Russia, and overcoming the socio-economic crisis are the most  acute problems facing the state in 1994".</p>

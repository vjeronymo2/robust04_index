			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Arts: Survivors of the Pop-Art phase - The work of Patrick Caulfield and Tom Phillips Is it a symptom of the fading year, or something more particular, that affects me every autumn after the Turner Prize? The fatuity of the conventional assumption that the new is necessarily better than the well-established, that the avant-garde position is the infallible mark of originality and achievement, that the young must ever be encouraged, is increasingly borne in on me. The young, like the poor, are always with us and need no encouragement. Patrick Caulfield, who is now 56, first attracted critical notice some 30 years ago, along with Hockney, Boshier, Jones and Blake, as a leading light of the young Pop-Art movement. Since then, Pop-Art has come and gone, but Caulfield has gone steadily on, quietly developing in his work and maturing as an artist. It is a truth too often forgotten that, beyond their immediate convenience, such general groupings mask great divergences and contradictions. The more we look into them at a decent distance, the more they fall apart or fade away. With Pop-Art, the whole was always less than the sum of its parts. Yet within its broadly accepted range of interests, Caulfield found the formal material and expressive means that have sustained him ever since. The obvious comparison is with the two Americans, Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein, artists, as is the American way, of infinitely larger international reputation. All three drew upon a similar stock of imagery, second-hand imagery taken from magazines and newspapers and distanced from immediate experience by process and technology. What these artists share is an ironical and dispassionate approach to the treatment of that material, more or less uninflected on the surface, disinterested and ambiguous in its engagement with experience. All three are stylists, dandies, aesthetes. The difference is that, as the two Americans became ever more decorative and superficial in their work, relying on gratuitous effects of scale or subject or conceptual context, Caulfield remained, and remains, close to his original subject, which is the still-life. The equivalents of the Caulfield office desk, the hotel bar or lobby, the full plate on the table, the awful currency of polite taste and modern design, have been the stuff of still-life through the centuries. The difference is only that his is an image of an image of reality, and an idealised reality at that, which he then puts through the several hoops of graphic and painterly mannerism. He does so with a consummate elegance, linear severity held in counterpoint with photo-realist particularity, the broadest scale with the closest focus. Do we begin to see a certain uncertainty, a hint of self-doubt creeping into the more recent work, with its drop in scale, its increased abstraction and concern with textured surfaces? The hope must be rather that Caulfield, with all his true artfulness, does not withdraw into the merely arty, self-referential and solipsistic. If only he would bring himself to subsume his cleverness, his art-historical and stylistic knowingness, which will never leave him, in the scrutiny of what is really there before him - the room, the plate, the glass, the flower on the table. Tom Phillips is 55, and had he come to his vocation a little sooner - he digressed to Oxford - he too would be considered still a Pop artist. As it is, his public debut coincided with the short-lived ascendancy of photo-realism on the one hand, and with conceptualism on the other - the idea itself that is the realised work of art - which two disparate isms he has so often sought to reconcile in his work. As with Caulfield, the work is nothing if not a contrived and self-conscious artefact, meticulously executed, the difference only that Phillips has none of Caulfield's easy elegance. But there are other virtues; his intelligent persistence and technical application are no less admirable. Such difficulties as there are rise less from what the works are as from their subject, which has always been centred upon the artist himself, whether examining the processes of his own art, or his own life. It was perhaps a mistake to give over an entire gallery to the extended 'Curriculum Vitae' sequence, which is nothing less than an autobiographical text, and was shown in any case at the National Portrait gallery three years ago. This is manifestly a grand public statement, and Phillips' best work has always been the more intimate and personal, and that which is more speculative and open in its handling. Here it is salutary to see how well so much of the early work stands up, that had seemed fussy, over-literary and unpainterly in its time - the park benches and the reworked post-card sequences especially. And the 'Humument' too, that jokey, quirky, sly, inventively deconstructive annotation of the novel of 1892, A Human Document, by one WH Mallock, seems fresher than ever. Worked on now over some 25 years, it remains perhaps the truest thing to his spirit as an artist that Phillips has ever done. He is an obsessive artist, a maker of series and sequences, a slave to system and habit who is still capable of trapping himself in the grandiose and the self-conscious, over-proud of his erudition and copious curiosity. It is as though he does not trust his hand and intuition without such intellectual props. Yet these are engaging vulnerabilities, and when he so forgets himself as to trust his hand to itself, as in the recent pastel drawing, 30 feet long, that investigates 'the beginning of language' no less  -a typical Phillips gloss - the work springs to life. Patrick Caulfield: Paintings 1963-1992 Serpentine Gallery, Kensington Gardens W2 until January 17. Tom Phillips: Major works 1970-1992, Sackler Galleries, Royal Academy, Piccadilly W1, until December 20.</p>

			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Chemical industry close to pact on cuts Europe's petrochemicals industry is close to agreeing rationalisation plans aimed at reducing losses running at hundreds of millions of dollars a month. The Association of Petrochemicals Producers in Europe (APPE) yesterday revealed its members had failed to agree plans to cut ethylene capacity by at least 1.5m tonnes a year. However, most petrochemicals groups were optimistic the complex plan would be approved next month. The APPE is scheduled to meet on December 17 . Chemical company shares responded favourably to the news. Imperial Chemical Industries shares rose 45p to 719p, while shares in DSM of the Netherlands increased Fl 4 to Fl 102.2. It is understood 25 APPE members voted, with 20 in favour, three against and two abstentions. Those hostile to the proposals, which involve setting up an industry fund worth about DM550m (Pounds 217m) to help close capacity, are believed to be producers that have already shut plants and have efficient complexes. Some believe more capacity needs to be taken out. During the early 1980s more than 4m tonnes was shut down. Legal and technical details of the APPE plan also remain to be settled. The European Commission would have to approve any plan. The European industry is dogged by over-capacity. Next year it will have capacity to manufacture 19.34m tonnes of ethylene, against expected demand of 15.58m tonnes, according to Trichem consultants, the London-based industry specialists. The company believes all European manufacturers of derivatives such as PVC and polyethylene have failed to cover their cash costs this year, let alone cover depreciation. The plan involves setting up an industry-financed restructuring fund. Companies would bid for funds in exchange for closing down capacity. Analysts were divided about the impact of the plan yesterday. S G Warburg said the move was a turning point for the industry and would improve earnings considerably. Others were more doubtful, saying the plan had yet to be agreed and would still require approval from competition authorities. They also said over-capacity was a worldwide problem and that Middle East and US petrochemicals manufacturers had a considerable cost advantage over European producers.</p>

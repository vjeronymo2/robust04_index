			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Peter Gill and Bill Pheasant] </F>   [Text] Indonesia's ambassador, Mr. Sabam Siagian, has  warned that Australia could become a "stagnant, inward-looking,  sulking" country, just as the federal government is embracing  its northern neighbor in a new, closer relationship. The  comments are a direct challenge to the government's efforts to  move Australia closer to Asia, and drew a sharp response from  the minister for foreign affairs, Senator Evans.    Mr. Siagian, speaking to a group of business leaders in  Melbourne, said cooperative ventures would help Indonesia become  a "modern, outward-looking country", but cooperative linkages, I  believe, are also beneficial for Australia. "At least they are  helpful to overcome the tendency to remain an isolated,  comfortable island of western civilization down under, thus  becoming a stagnant country."    "A stagnant, inward-looking, sulking Australia definitely is  not in the interests of a dynamically growing Indonesia." In  response, Senator Evans strongly denied Australia was stagnant  or sulking. Through a spokeswoman, he said last night: "It looks  like either the reporter or Sabam got his tenses mixed up: we  are no longer stagnant and inward-looking, and we have never  been sulking."    The tough critique by Mr. Siagian came as Senator Evans was  warmly talking up a new relationship with Indonesia in response  to a parliamentary committee report on the relationship between  the two countries. Senator Evans said sensitivities in the  relationship would remain over issues such as human rights, but  closer ties were manifest in events such as a big trade and  cultural promotion scheduled this month in Jakarta. Eight  ministers, including the prime minister, Mr. Keating -- who has  invested much of his foreign policy credibility in Australia's  relationship with Indonesia -- will attend the Australia Today:  Indonesia '94 exercise.    The significance of Mr. Siagian's comments yesterday are the  reflection they contain on the success the federal government  has achieved to date in its quest for a closer relationship with  Asia. Mr. Siagian was speaking at the launch of an association  between the Australian legal firm Minter Ellison Morris Fletcher  with Makarim &amp; Taira S, a leading corporate law firm and  trade  consultancy in Jakarta: "I do hope that this cooperative venture  between the two legal firms will help in some way in  establishing a good relationship between our two countries, but  also provide a significant contribution to the increasingly  solid ballast as an underpinning for the expanding and deepening  relationship between Indonesia and Australia."    Earlier, Senator Evans told parliament: "We are poised to  enter a new phase in our relations [with Indonesia]."    "We can build on our gains so far, and we must take  advantage  of the momentum for taking forward the relationship which now  exists."    A senior lawyer with Makarim &amp; Taira S, Mr. Nono  Makarim,  told the assembled lawyers and company directors that Australia  needed to learn from Japanese economists such as Saburo Okita  that industrialized countries had to leave basic manufacturing  to developing countries.    Mr. Makarim said Indonesian government and business leaders  had adopted the ideas of Saburo Okira, "who said 'developed  countries ... if you want to continue growing, go in the  direction of the sophisticated industries, of the  technology-intensive industries, and leave the simple industries  for the developing countries'. That was very attractive and  they believed that."    Mr. Makarim warned that Australia's protection of its  manufacturing industries could affect the bilateral relationship  between the two nations.</p>

			<p><P> January 16, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RALPHS STORES NOT AFFECTED BY SISTER FIRMS' BANKRUPTCY  </P> <P> Ralphs Grocery Co. will not be affected by the bankruptcy filings of sister  companies Allied Stores Corp. and Federated Department Stores Inc., company  spokesmen said Monday.  </P> <P> Executives of the Southern California supermarket chain say that Ralphs is  insulated from the financial problems that have beset Toronto-based Campeau  Corp. and its Allied and Federated subsidiaries, which filed for protection  under Chapter 11 of U.S. bankruptcy laws on Monday.  </P> <P> Ralphs was not included in the filings.  </P> <P> "Nothing will change in our stores," said Byron Allumbaugh, Ralphs' chairman.  "We are in a very strong, independent position. To our customers, we will look  the same."  </P> <P> Campeau, which acquired Ralphs as part of its 1988 takeover of Federated, owns  Ralphs' common stock through its subsidiaries. But Ralphs, which was spun off  from Federated, has its own debt, lines of credit and corporate structure,  which allow it to stand alone from the rest of Campeau and its affiliates.  </P> <P> As a result, Allumbaugh said, the grocery company does not need funds from  Campeau, and Campeau and its affiliates are prohibited from removing any funds  from Ralphs.  </P> <P> Last week, Ralphs executives denied rumors to a group of 400 suppliers that the  supermarket chain was about to file for bankruptcy protection. Allumbaugh told  the suppliers that Ralphs cut its losses from $72.6 million in fiscal 1988 to  about $31 million in fiscal 1989, which ends on Jan. 28.  </P> <P> The company projects a net loss of $7 million in the coming year, followed by a  $17-million profit in fiscal 1991.  </P></p>

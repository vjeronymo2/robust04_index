			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with General Hernan Jose Guzman, Commander of the </F> Army, by John Gutierrez; place and date not given: "Guzman: `The  Guerrillas Want To Be the Third Cartel'"]    [Excerpt] "The Army Has No Interest in Covering Up  Any Crime."    [Passage omitted] [Gutierrez] How would you rate your  performance in 1993?    [Guzman] We have made progress on meeting the goals that we  set. This is borne out by the results achieved in our country  this year (see below), both in terms of action waged against  terrorists as well as against organized crime and drug  trafficking. We got rid of nearly 1,000 terrorists and captured  1,873 guerrillas. In addition, the Medellin Cartel has been  brought to its knees by the National Police and Escobar was  killed.    [Gutierrez] Not all sectors see the crack in the guerrilla  organization so clearly.    [Guzman] We have made progress this year on breaking up the  guerrilla organization thanks to the intervention of the  Prosecutor General's Office. Without its help, we would not have  been able to put that many terrorists behind bars. Charges have  been filed against every one of them and their illegal  activities are being spelled out in detail. We have filed our  evidence and those guerrillas will be brought before the courts.    [Gutierrez] In practice, is there not more than one area off  limits to the Army?    [Guzman] No. To date, no area has been declared off limits  to  the Army. The Army has gone in and enforced the law. I can give  you one example: In the San Lucas Mountains, funds for the ELN  [Army of National Liberation] came from gold mining and cocaine  operations and the Army went in and took control of the  situation. The same is true of San Jose del Guaviare. We cleaned  the area out.    [Gutierrez] But we are still seeing videos of terrorist  summit conferences in areas under the jurisdiction of the Mobile  Brigades, the antiterrorist forces.    [Guzman] That is all highly relative. The videos that they  are showing us are not at all authentic. It is easy to stage a  meeting in the jungle in two or three days. They can easily meet  and immediately break up again and that is what happened.    In some cases in which we went in on the basis of  information  that we had, the individuals had already held their meeting and  left. It is all highly relative when one is operating in a  jungle area. There you have to move troops by helicopter and  sometimes, for any number of reasons, you may not have the  logistics in place and be forced to postpone the mission for 24  hours. In such cases, when an operation is postponed, those  elements immediately change their plans.    [Gutierrez] How do the troops view the process that began  with the [Socialist Renewal] Current (CRS)?    [Guzman] As very positive. I wish that other terrorist  organizations would hear us and understand the importance of  peace. I think that that is the best way, the solution chosen by  the previous terrorist groups and the one now being used by the  CRS. It believes that the most positive option is unquestionably  to engage in dialogue and a favorable solution for the nation.    [Gutierrez] What about the FARC [Revolutionary Armed Forces  of Colombia] and the ELN?    [Guzman] I think that what is happening in this case is that  the terrorists do not want to even hear about any dialogue,  which is an enormous mistake because they have not allowed the  conditions to be created for the National Government to take the  position of talking with them. They have always played tricks.    Now all the guerrillas want to do is engage in extortion,  steal livestock from ranches, actively engage in actual drug  trafficking, and become the third-ranking drug cartel in order  to finance their activities.    [Gutierrez] Does that explain attacks like the last one in  Guican?    [Guzman] The guerrillas as such have been defeated for quite  some time. Now they are acting like the rings that engage in  common crime, drug trafficking, and terrorism. I can guarantee  that these organizations have reached one of their lowest points  ever because we are hitting them everywhere.    Such actions can only be explained when dealing with a ring  of criminals. Drug traffickers attack anything they can and the  FARC and ELN care about absolutely nothing. In Sumapaz, they  machine-gunned an ambulance even though it was properly  identified, which shows a total lack of respect for human rights  in general.    They hide behind the shield of human rights of which they  themselves are the worst violators.... The terrorists have  distorted information in order to discredit the Armed Forces and  the Police for alleged irregular conduct.    [Gutierrez] The Attorney General's Office agrees on this,  but  the organization has also filed a number of isolated complaints  against members of the Armed Forces.    [Guzman] I think we have made great progress in this area  this year. We have drafted regulations and convinced our people  that they must respect human rights.    That business about the Attorney General's Office "syndrome"  has disappeared. The Ministry of Justice has proceeded with  total transparency. Some investigations have even been conducted  jointly.    In the case of Riofrio, for example, we turned our  investigation over to the Attorney General's Office, as we did  in the case of Uraba. There, the Armed Forces inspector and  deputy attorney general worked together.    The Army has absoslutely no interest in covering up any  crime  or any alleged crime that we are said to have committed. We  shall not hesitate to discipline or impose criminal penalties on  those guilty of irregular conduct.

			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Sport: Talk turns to football Quite often I spend Sunday at my parents' home, where the languid hours are given structure by the Sky Television broadcast of a Premier League football match. 'What's the game today? Ah, that'll be a good one,' my father will say to me during lunch. In so doing he speaks the words which begin the afternoon ritual. By 2.45pm the television will be tuned to Sky Sports, the better to savour the moments before the programme begins: within the flickering images we conjure those of the perfect football match. During the hours of build-up to the game itself, which Sky fills with prognostications and statistics, we create in the living room a studio debate of our own. Back and forth go the comments: 'Who's going to win it?' - 'Newcastle, 3-0' - 'No, Spurs will get one' - 'Their bubble's burst' - 'Think they'll go down?' - 'Think Newcastle will win the league?' - 'Their bubble might burst'. At 4pm, the moment of kick-off, we will have reached a peak of expectation. For the first 10 minutes we will follow play like metal detectors moving along the ground. Then it will become apparent that the game is no longer exerting the hold over us that it should. By approximately 4.20pm, my eyes will be irresistibly drawn to the Sunday papers, my mother will have removed herself from her studio chair and my father will be fast asleep. To us, clearly, the true joy of football lies in the paraphernalia that goes with it, and especially in those meaningless, circuitous, wonderfully comforting conversations that anyone with the slightest idea about the game can have. When I worked in the theatre, we would talk endlessly about other actors and directors - 'Oh, he was in his hamlet' - 'Oh she auditioned for that' - with a good deal more zeal than we would bring to the serious business of acting and directing. In the world of sport, the subject of the conversations may be very different but the conversations themselves are exactly the same. Of course, many of the people who indulge in football chit-chat are true lovers of the game, capable of staying awake throughout an entire Sunday afternoon with Sky Television. Sometimes I have one of these conversations with my mother's window cleaner, a diehard Luton Town supporter. It is obvious that we are saying the same things for different reasons. I am doing it for the pleasure of affirming my knowledge, and he's doing it for the pleasure of talking about the thing that he loves. To me, the thought of going to watch Luton Town is entirely unappealing, as indeed is the thought of going to most football matches. And I suspect that is true of a large number of people who purport to love football. What they love is knowing about it. They love being au fait with transfer deals and intrigues: they love talking about it. These are the people who were tapped into by Nick Hornby's Fever Pitch. That book was written by a true fan of football, but its genius is that it spoke not merely to those who loved the game, but to those who loved the paraphernalia of the game. And the great thing is that it is so easy to talk about football. What do I know about Luton Town? Nothing. But by deploying a few totemic phrases, for example referring to the fact that the manager - Pleaty - has no money with which to build his teams, I can hold a conversation with someone who has seen them play practically every weekend of his adult life. Ridiculous, yet true. Sometimes I wonder, though, who really does know anything about football. Who really understands its infinite but oddly banal complexities? Managers are the avowed experts, but look at the howlers that most of them make. Look, too, at Terry Venables, hailed as the man who would revitalise England, reduced to recalling most of the players used by the reviled Graham Taylor; where is the magical knowledge that can unearth the unexpected? For heaven's sake, even I could have picked the team that played recently against the USA. Football is, in fact, the most slippery and mysterious of sports. So much should be possible, but so often this potential turns to predictability. There must be thousands of ways in which a team can score, but goals almost always occur simply through luck. The lacklustre World Cup final between Brazil and Italy proved that football can never be relied upon to entertain; last week's UEFA cup defeat of Blackburn by part-timers Trelleborgs proved that mediocrity can always triumph over talent. Really, sometimes one wonders why anyone likes football at all. At the moment, sated after days of unrelenting bombardment, I have as much appetite for it as I would have for the last meal of a gourmet weekend. But you still can't stop me talking it.</p>

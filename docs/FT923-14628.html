			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: ICI falls to year's low point CHEMICALS giant ICI, often viewed as the barometer of British corporate performance, fell to its lowest level this year as sellers re-appeared. The setback of 35 to 1139p brought it to within easy reach of the range last seen immediately following the stock market crash of October 1987. Yesterday's slide was prompted by rumour rather than fact, or, as one dealer put it: 'There are any number of excuses but no stories.' The excuse with most substance was the announcement, late last week, that ICI had agreed a 5.1 per cent pay settlement. This was in line with the group's big German rivals but there had been some anticipation in the market that, at a time when margins are being squeezed, it might be lower. The second excuse related to Goldman Sachs' reputed 10m share stake in ICI, reportedly bought from Hanson for Pounds 14 a share. There was comment that Goldman might abandon any hope of getting its money back and may be about to cut its losses, leaving the market awash with ICI stock. Finally, some commentators pointed to the failure of Spanish chemical group Ercros to reschedule Dollars 2.15bn (Pounds 1.12bn) of debt. However, Ercros is heavily involved in fertilisers, a sector which ICI largely moved out of last year, and the trading environment of the two companies appears very different. Forte setback A series of downgrades in Forte yesterday followed the hotel group's decision to pull out of negotiations to sell its catering division, including the Gardner Merchant subsidiary, which it announced after the market closed on Friday. The shares fell 6 to 178p in heavy trading of 6m. Profit forecasts for this year have been pruned by around a fifth to between Pounds 86m to Pounds 100m, with the company's broker UBS Phillips &amp; Drew at the bottom of the range. While most of the blame was on the dire state of the UK hotel market, the collapse of negotiations prompted talk of Forte's growing 'credibility problem' amongst investors. Meanwhile, the latest names to be linked with Gardner Merchant include KKR, the New York buy-out specialists, who may try and revive a buy-out with the Gardner management, and French outside caterers Sodexho - although such a move would leave Forte with a rump of catering businesses it did not want. Compass Group, which returned from suspension following the collapse of the talks, tumbled 46 to 443p. Asda nervous Poor results from Asda were expected and the shares remained steady, shading a halfpenny to 29 1/2 p in below-average volume of 7.5m. Analysts held out some hope that the group, now under new management, could recover market share - although tough trading conditions and strong competition meant that they remained cautious on the stock. Mr Ian McDougall at Nomura said; 'Asda needs to reposition itself and return to a more value-for-money approach. But it is up against stiff opposition in a difficult market. Patience will be needed.' Glaxo rally A sharp fall in the price of Glaxo was halted in the afternoon after one US house was said to have stressed its positive stance on the stock. Glaxo fell 24 in early trading as dealers hit companies that trade heavily in New York. The shares recovered to close only 13 off at 649p, with marketmakers saying that Dr Jonathan Gelles of Wertheim Schroder had issued a buy note. Dr Gelles was in London for meetings and unavailable for comment. Un. Discount fall Troubled discount house Union Discount almost halved, eventually closing a net 51 lower at 64p, after the group signalled that it expected to record a loss of as much as Pounds 15m for the six months to the end of June and that the interim dividend would be omitted. Other discount house shares were marked down sharply in the wake of the Union Discount news. More downgrades of Burmah Castrol were said to be in the pipeline with the shares closing a further 7 off at 576p. Merchant banks, already suffering from the extremely low activity in the stock market and the dearth of takeover bids and other corporate activity, were upset by the poor performance of Union Discount's money broking operation. SG Warburg, regarded by many as the leading trader in gilts, money markets and equities in the UK, dropped 5 more to 490p. Kleinwort Benson, another big trader in UK markets, retreated 23 to 259p, although turnover was a paltry 275,000 shares. Schroders dropped 23 to 1085p and Hambros 4 to 243p. Wellcome picked up 6 to 883p as the global book on the share flotation opened yesterday. Wellcome Trust, which owns around 75 per cent of the shares, is set to float some 330m of them and analysts are beginning to talk about a price of between 750p and 800p for the issue. There was also speculation that the shares were squeezed up as some bears closed their positions. Meanwhile, Japanese investors are said to be holding fire on whether or not to invest in the flotation until they see how much interest there is. Solid results from Scottish &amp; Newcastle helped the stock stand out in a weak drinks sector. The shares gained 3 to 463p. In a weak leisure sector beset by recovery worries, Ladbroke stood out as Smith New Court recommended buying as concerns over its property interests had been overdone. The shares edged up a penny to 203p. Elsewhere Rank Organisation tumbled 20 to 623p ahead of results on Thursday, while a BZW downgrade hit Thorn EMI, off 17 at 773p. Container group Tiphook tumbled after it reported figures below analysts' expectations. The shares fell 54 to 333p after it revealed full-year profits up Pounds 16m at Pounds 86.4m. Profit taking and general market sentiment caused a slide in BM Group. The shares gave up 24 to 121p. Engineering and industrial manufacturing company TT Group eased 7 to 215p after it proposed a merger with AB Electronic Products Group in which it had bought a 6.35 per cent stake. Shares in AB responded by jumping 12 to 90p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (18).

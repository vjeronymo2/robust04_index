			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Belelli to build oil platform ITALY'S Belelli group has won a L130bn (Pounds 54.6m) contract to build an offshore oil platform for Shell and BP for deep- water production in the US waters of the Gulf of Mexico, writes Robert Graham in Rome. The 20,000-ton platform, designed to sit in 910 metres of water, will be able to produce 100,000 b/d of crude and 110m cubic feet of natural gas. Belelli will be using a special 'tension leg' design which involves a floating hull stabilised through the attachment of steel tendons to the ocean floor. The new platform will operate some 200km south-west of New Orleans in the Mars field, which the new tension leg technology has made it possible to exploit. Belelli has built a previous tension leg platform for Shell for use in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

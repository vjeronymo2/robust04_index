			<p><P> July 10, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PUTTING UP THEIR DUKES FOR UCI BENEFIT;  </P> <P> TEAM TENNIS: NEWPORT BEACH DUKES MAKE THEIR DEBUT TONIGHT AGAINST AN ANTEATER  ALUMNI TEAM AT JOHN WAYNE TENNIS CLUB.  </P> <P> Team Tennis returns to Orange County for the first time in seven years tonight,  but it's just for practice.  </P> <P> The Newport Beach Dukes debut with an exhibition match against a UC Irvine  alumni team at 7 p.m. at John Wayne Tennis Club.  </P> <P> The UCI alumni team features former All-American Mike Briggs and Bruce Man Song  Hing. All-American Trevor Kronemann was originally scheduled to play but was a  late selection of the Charlotte Heat.  </P> <P> The Dukes' season begins for real against the Raleigh Edge, another new  franchise, Thursday at 7:30 p.m.  </P> <P> The Dukes will play 13 additional matches -- six at home, seven on the road --  before the regular season ends Aug. 5. If they avoid last place in the  four-team West Division, the Dukes will qualify for the Team Tennis playoffs.  </P> <P> The real task for the Dukes, however, may be survival.  </P> <P> Two other county-based Team Tennis franchises folded quickly -- the Anaheim  Oranges in 1978 and the California Oranges in 1983.  </P> <P> Neither was successful, financially or otherwise. The Anaheim Oranges lasted  just one season. The California Oranges lasted just three, and their best  record was 8-5 in 1983. Their final match, a 30-27 victory over the Dallas  Stars, drew only 636 to the Newport Beach Tennis Club on July 29, 1983.  </P> <P> The Dukes begin their first season with high expectations, on the court and at  the box office.  </P> <P> Marty Davis, a former Davis Cup player; Roger Smith, the top-ranked player in  the Bahamas; Sophie Amiach, who played with league runner-up Sacramento last  season, and 17-year-old Amy Frazier make up the Dukes' roster.  </P> <P> Greg Patton, men's tennis coach at UCI for 11 seasons, will serve as their  coach.  </P> <P> "This is going to be a new experience for me," Patton said. "I want to have a  dialogue with the men. Mostly, I'll be working with the women and the doubles.  I'll treat them like they've been through it all before."  </P> <P> Ticket sales have been brisk, particularly for tonight's exhibition, a benefit  for UCI's athletic department. But even Fred Lieberman, the Dukes'  owner/promoter, said he isn't sure how many people will want to watch Team  Tennis.  </P></p>

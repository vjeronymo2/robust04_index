Katyal: "G-15 Relevance Reaffirmed"] </F>   [Text] New Delhi, Dec. 13--The presence here of the  Malaysian Prime Minister, Dr. Mahathir Mohamed, and the Zimbabwe  President, Mr. Robert Mugabe, and their talks with the Prime  Minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao, and other government  representatives today were notable for the reaffirmation of  support to the G-15 and its efforts to articulate the  aspirations of the South.    The decision of the two dignitaries to stick to their plans  to visit India even after the postponement of the summit was a  symbolic gesture intended to convey their faith in the relevance  of the grouping and their interest to strengthen it. This was  evident from their interaction with the Indian leaders. The  meaning of the gesture was, certainly, not lost.    The postponed summit, it became clear after today's talks,  will be held either in the last week of March or first week of  April. And, as was decided by the permanent representatives of  the member-countries, the format of the grouping would remain  unchanged--the quorum will continue to be 10; the summit will be  held, as in the past, once a year; and representation in it will  continue to be confined to the heads of State or government.  These decisions were approved by the Ministers from all but  three of the 15 who met towards the end of last week.    China and Iran had shown interest in associating themselves  with the G-15--the former as an observer, the latter as a  member. This was among the significant points of last week's  discussions which may figure in the talks of Dr. Mahathir  Mohamed and Mr. Mugabe, due to be continued tomorrow. A formal  decision on new members could, however, be taken by the summit.    Dr. Mahathir, who arrived here yesterday, was accorded a  ceremonial welcome this morning in the forecourt of Rashtrapati  Bhavan. He met Mr. Rao for informal consultations, followed by  lunch, at the latter's residence. A meeting with a group of  Indian businessmen before lunch, and a call on the President,  Dr. S.D. Sharma, in the afternoon were the other highlights of  his programme. The Finance Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, and the  Railway Minister, Mr. Jaffar Sharif, called on the visiting  Prime Minister.    Mr. Mugabe, who arrived in the morning too, was given a  ceremonial reception at Rashtrapati Bhavan. In the afternoon, he  and Mr. Rao met with their delegations. Later, the two held  talks without aides.  <H5>  Promoting cooperation </H5>   Mr. Mugabe's delegation-level talks with Mr. Rao and the  Malaysian Prime Minister's informal discussions with Indian  businessmen were part of their other objective--to utilise the  visits for considering ways to promote bilateral cooperation,  specially in the economic field. Mr. Mugabe met the  representative of the Confederation of Indian Industries (CII),  while Dr. Mahathir Mohamed will see them at a lunch to be hosted  by it tomorrow. The former's plan to visit the National Small  Industries Corporation and the latter's programme to go to the  Maruti factory tomorrow reflect their interests--Malaysia is  keen on expanding opportunities for business and industrial  cooperation (the two sides are to sign agreements for joint  ventures) while Zimbabwe counts on India's help in rural, small  and agro-based industries, extension services, and simple  technology, related to its needs. Soon, Zimbabwe will take over  huge farms, which continued to be managed by the whites since  its independence 13 years ago, and distribute the land among the  blacks. It will, therefore, be interested in India's help in  building its infrastructure in the agricultural sector.    The informal talks between the Prime Ministers of India and  Malaysia related, apart from G-15-related items like the  updating of the draft summit communique, to the role of the U.N.  and its peace-keeping operations and human rights.    Bilateral cooperation was the main subject of discussion  between Dr. Sharma and Dr. Mahathir Mohamed. Asian countries,  according to them, had made significant strides in the  industrial and technological fields and there was immense scope  for cooperation among them in the economic spheres. In their  opinion, developing countries could achieve a lot by sharing  their experiences in development and pooling their resources for  the common good and prosperity.</p>

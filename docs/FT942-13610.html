			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / How to Spend it: Avant garde for the home - A young furniture designer who today opens his own shop If your house is still awash with chintz and swags, with gilded putti and grand soft sofas this piece is not for you. This is for those who are interested in the new, the young, the experimental, who by nature veer towards the avant-garde. Tom Dixon, one of our most successful young furniture designers, has decided to open a shop of his own. Like Sir Terence Conran before him, he has found that for a designer with strong ideas of his own, there is no substitute for one's very own retail outlet, free from the constrictions of conventional furniture departments and the kind of mind that thinks in terms of three-piece suites. Tom Dixon is one of a bright young group that started work in the early 80s and began exploring ways of turning discarded materials into things of beauty and usefulness. His early curving voluptuous shapes were formed from scavenged materials. Later he moved on to sheet metal which he fashions in the studio. Early in his career he came to the notice of an Italian manufacturer, Cappellini, and many of his designs are now in proper production, including his most famous design, the S-chair (photographed below left). Now fully established with his own studio in south London he found that many of the people working with him in the studio had bright ideas of their own but were stumped as to how to sell them. He started by allowing them to develop their own designs in the studio (which gives them space and equipment) in the evenings and at weekends. When he saw the results he realised the next thing they needed was an outlet. Almost nobody, he feels, is prepared to stock the kind of innovative, not too expensive designs that the young are interested in and that his designers make. So today, in the livelier reaches of north Kensington, he opens his own shop called Space. The tastes and styles of the various designers vary but they share a common interest in exploring new materials and new ways of using them. For instance there is furniture made from recycled plastic, (some of it, by Jane Atfield, featured on this page earlier in the year), there is Christina Lamiquiz's seating made from what looks for all the world like woven metal string and is in fact stainless steel mesh and titanium and there is Hikaru Noguchi's extraordinary fabric-covered furniture. She has developed some flocking techniques ('borrowing,' as Space puts it, 'from the aesthetic of the Indian restaurant') which have never before been used on upholstery - Michael Young's lozenge-shaped seats are made from foam and then covered in it while Tom Dixon has used it to cover some of his established classics. Realising that some of the prices of the furniture will be beyond the reach of the people they would most like to reach (Tom Dixon's own famous S-shaped chair, for instance, sells for about Pounds 900, his 'crown' for Pounds 600) they aim to keep up a steady flow of interesting, original accessories. For the opening today, for instance, there will be rubber bathmats, some children's furniture by Simon Maidment, candlesticks and wall brackets by Candice Bovill Taylor. It ought to be a good source of interesting lighting. Tom Dixon's own experiments with covering metal structures with tissue paper will be on sale, in particular there will be variations on the theme of his Brancusi lighting column and the star lantern. It will also be the London outlet for the Cappellini range of his designs. Space, 28 All Saints' Road, London W11. Telephone 071-727-0134. Most of the pieces can be bought by mail-order.</p>

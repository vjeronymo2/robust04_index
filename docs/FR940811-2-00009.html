This standardization of documentation, in conjunction with FIPS 174 (Former Draft FED&hyph;STD&hyph;1090), which specifies telecommunications wiring, and FIPS 175 (Former Draft FED&hyph;STD&hyph;1091), which provides architectural specification of telecommunications pathways and spaces, will facilitate systems compatibility and transportability of terminals for Federal users. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another companion standard, ANSI/EIA/TIA&hyph;570&hyph;1991, Residential and Light Commercial Telecommunications Wiring Standard, has been adopted as Federal Information Processing Standard 176 (Former Draft FED&hyph;STD&hyph;1092). This standard specifies telecommunications wiring for small buildings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the development of this family of building telecommunications standards, significant concern was expressed, by both Government and industry, about the need for specification of electronic system grounding. This concern resulted in proposed ANSI/TIA/EIA&hyph;607, Grounding and Bonding Requirements for Telecommunications in Commercial Buildings, which will be proposed for adoption as a future Federal Information Processing Standard (Draft FED&hyph;STD&hyph;1093). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;19649 Filed 8&hyph;10&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;CN&hyph;M <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / DPP backs calls on plea bargaining MRS Barbara Mills, the director of public prosecutions, yesterday added her voice to calls for a formal system of plea bargaining in English and Welsh courts. She said plea agreements worked out in open court where all parties knew what was on offer were 'very sensible' and it was time to consider them. Mrs Mills also said that formalising the system of sentence discounts for defendants who plead guilty should be studied. Presenting the Crown Prosecution Service's annual report, Mrs Mills said she did not see an enhanced role for the CPS in the investigation of crimes as the answer to miscarriages of justice, but thought there was a case for the CPS giving more advice to the police before they charged suspects. Last year 10 per cent of 1.5m cases handled by the CPS were discontinued because the prosecution service disagreed with the police charges. In response to the Competing for Quality white paper, published last November, the CPS is also looking at functions that can be contracted out. The National Audit Office yesterday called for urgent measures to control the sharp rise in legal aid expenditure. Sir John Bourn, head of the NAO, says in a report to parliament on legal aid in England and Wales that expenditure rose 85 per cent - from Pounds 387m to Pounds 717m - between 1986-87 and 1990-91. In 1991-92 the Lord Chancellor's Department and the Legal Aid Board expect a 30 per cent overspend - Pounds 210m more than the approved estimate of Pounds 698m. A review by Touche Ross, chartered accountants, suggested that legal aid frauds by lawyers could total Pounds 6.4m a year through claims for work not done.</p>

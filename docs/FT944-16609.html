			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Exchange awakens to attractions of non-trade investment The London Metal Exchange once was hostile to fund and other non-trade activity in its markets, said Mr David King, the exchange's chief executive, yesterday, but now welcomed this business because it enhanced liquidity and reduced volatility. However, although fund activity on the LME had grown significantly in the past few months, it was not nearly as large as occasionally portrayed in the media and represented less than 5 per cent of the exchange's turnover. Funds were attracted to the LME by the apparent potential for metals price rises based on genuine fundamentals. Also 'the LME now has a very deep, liquid market compared with the size of market it had at the time of the last (economic) recovery, and financial engineering and rocket scientist technology which was now widely available - and all the ingredients were there for funds, in various guises, indices, warrants and other products, to move in and create positions in LME's market'. The LME's turnover had increased sixfold in six years to 35.3m 'lots' in 1993, equivalent to 800m tonnes of metal valued at USDollars 1,000bn, he pointed out at a conference organised by Metal Bulletin. In 1994 turnover would increase by another 35 per cent to about 45m lots, or nearly Dollars 2,000bn. LME users needed to adjust in future to a new 'fundamental' in LME price discovery, said Mr King. 'Along with supply/demand levels, rock blasts, miners' strikes and LME stock levels there must be added the fundamental of non-trade activity - the movement of funds into or out of LME markets, driven by their own trading strategies or chart points, causing with their movement, a movement in LME prices.'</p>

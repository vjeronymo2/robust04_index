			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Kewill Pounds 4m in the black and resumes dividend payments Kewill Systems, the USM-quoted computer software and systems group, is paying dividends again, the trauma of struggles with Weigang, its ill-starred former subsidiary, behind it. For the year to March 31 it is proposing a final of 5p, the first for two years, from earnings per share of 23p, against losses of 50.99p. The payment is a reflection of a capital reconstruction and a much improved performance. The shares rose 9p to 284p. Profits before tax reached a record Pounds 4.04m, compared with a loss of Pounds 5.19m restated for FRS 3 and struck after a loss of Pounds 5.63m on the sale of Weigang, a German software house. Turnover fell 4.7 per cent to Pounds 31.8m, against Pounds 33.3m, which included Pounds 2.34m from Weigang. The decline also reflected the fall in hardware values affecting the computer industry. Borrowings were reduced from Pounds 3.96m to Pounds 77,000 during the year and have since been reduced further. The interest charge fell from a net Pounds 809,000 to Pounds 305,000. Kewill specialises in soft-ware for manufacturing and accountancy and has a new and fast growing interest in electronic document interchange. Mr Kevin Overstall, chairman, said there were few signs of new investment yet among companies in the UK and Europe but trading in the US was much improved with profits up to Pounds 1.21m, compared with Pounds 280,000. 'New products, improving economic conditions and further reductions in operating costs all point to continued profitable growth over the coming year' he said. COMMENT The saga of Kewill and Weigang, purchased for a song in 1991, should serve as a cautionary tale of overseas expansion for small companies. The acquisition went wrong and Kewill's management found itself out of its depth in a foreign country and a foreign language. An investment of Pounds 500,000 turned, in two years, into a goodwill write-off of Pounds 5.6m by the time the company was disposed of to its management. During this sorry episode, however, Kewill's basic business remained sound and profitable despite the recession. Its software is generally well regarded and it is looking to acquire compatible companies - in the UK, this time. With Weigang a lesson learned, the shares, on a historic p/e of 12, are cheap.</p>

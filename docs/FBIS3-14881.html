The court canceled the election result in the electoral  district where Zhirinovskiy won the December 12 elections. The  reason for the ruling is that a Yabloko bloc candidate resigned  from the election race in favor of the Russia's Choice candidate  but his name remained in the electoral bulletin.</p>

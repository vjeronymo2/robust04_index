			<p>Language: <F P=105> Somali </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The period for the United Somali Congress [USC]  Central Committee ran up to 5 July 1993, which coincided with  the UN Operation in Somalia [UNOSOM] forces' attack on the  Somali National Alliance [SNA]. For this reason it became  necessary to delay for another six months, and to hold the USC  congress at that time, according to its constitution, said the  USC secretary general, who was also the chairman of the USC  mini-congress held in Mogadishu today.    The mini-congress was attended by members of the USC  executive committee, USC central committee members, members of  the USC permanent committee, delegates of the USC communities,  women's organizations, youth council representatives and  religious leaders of the USC and other invited guests.    First, Mr. Abd-al-Karim Ahmed Ali [USC secretary general]  delivered a speech and spoke about the problems encountered by  the USC in the last two and a half years. The participants all  voted unanimously in favor of the USC central committee and the  chairman holding office for a further six months. [passage  omitted]    They decided to extend the period for the USC central  committee by six months. The mini-congress opened at 1000,  there was a break at 1300 and it resumed at 1330. [passage  omitted] Three hundred and six participants and invited guests  expressed their support for the decision at the conclusion of  the meeting at 1500 with applause. Mr. Abd-al-Karim Ahmed Ali  closed the meeting by promising to meet the heavy responsibility  properly and he prayed that God would help them. He said that  the proceedings of the congress will be reported to Mr. Mohamed  Farah Aidid, the USC chairman, on whose behalf he was speaking.</p>

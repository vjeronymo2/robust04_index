			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Asian vote explodes new myths about party allegiances - Campaigners' efforts to target ethnic minorities with ethnic issues may have been misplaced ANOTHER grey evening was drawing in as Mr Mohammed Ishaq studiously chewed a date to break his fast for Ramadan, which ends a few days before polling day. For Moslems it is a time of religious cleansing, but it may take longer for some of the Nottingham community to purge their bitterness towards the Labour party. 'If you say to me, why are you voting Labour? What have they done for you? I have no answer for you,' says Mr Ishaq. His word is important in this area of brick-built terraces which supports about 100 Moslem families. No more than a handful of Moslem men have jobs in this part of Nottingham South, where the Tories are trying to hang on to a 4.2 per cent majority over Labour. Next door, in Nottingham East, the Conservative majority is even more slender and, on the basis of the present polls, the seat should fall to Labour with ease. Labour's doubt concerns a section of its traditional Moslem supporters who feel that the party's national executive engineered a split among Moslem constituency members when Mr John Heppell, deputy leader of Nottinghamshire County Council, was selected as the Labour candidate earlier this year. The squabble has been marked by claims, counter-claims and a national executive investigation into constituency membership irregularities. But the allegations are less important than how Moslems react at the polls. Acrimony over Nottingham East has spilled over into Nottingham South and many working class Moslems, upon whom Labour could have relied, seem intent on making the party sweat it out until election day. Mr Ishaq, a firm Labour supporter, says that he is not so sure. He is angry and feels let down by Labour's failure to select an Asian candidate in either seat. As the local halal butcher explains: 'How Ishaq votes, I vote, and that counts for everyone around here.' Even so, most of the local Moslems are likely to back Labour. 'The Labour party may have split the community but they haven't yet split the family,' says Mr Ishaq. Moslem anger among Britain's Asian-origin communities is becoming a hallmark of election campaigns but it has yet to manifest itself in a significant shift from Labour. The more organised groups, such as Bradford Council of Mosques, are presenting candidates with lists of issues and using the campaign to put over minority grievances. Such lists tend to mask the true voting intentions and concerns of Britain's estimated 1.8m voters of Asian origin. Dr Shamit Saggar, a lecturer in politics at Queen Mary and Wedfield College at the University of London, says: 'Attitudes of Asian voters to politicians and policies are remarkably similar to those of white electors.' Drawing on a 1987 Harris poll, he says the two most important issues among people of Asian origin are unemployment and prices. Since 1979, immigration issues have dropped well down the list of Asian concerns, he says. Election candidates, he argues, worry too much about what they perceive as important ethnic issues. 'They would be better off approaching an Asian doorstep as they do any other.' Traditional Asian support for Labour appears to be holding firm in spite of Conservative contentions that they are natural Tory supporters. A poll by Harris last year for East, BBC 2's Asian-affairs programme, said 76 per cent of Asians intended to vote Labour, 18 per cent Conservative and 4 per cent Liberal Democrat. This indicates that more people of Asian origin intend to vote Labour than in 1987, although their support has fallen since 1990. Dr Saggar believes the statistics 'explode the myth' that they are switching allegiance to the Conservatives in significant numbers. A Sikh trader who commutes from Leicester to Nottingham, where he runs an electrical shop, says: 'I may wear a tie but I carry the boxes into my shop and I drive the van. I may work for myself but I'm still working and Labour is still the party for the working man.' Efforts by Mr Kenneth Baker, the home secretary, and Mr Norman Tebbit before him to woo the rich Asian vote have secured high-profile supporters but failed to make significant inroads into the community and are unlikely to trouble either Mr Keith Vaz, the sitting MP in Leicester East, or Mr Greville Janner in Leicester West, both Labour marginals where the party expects to increase its vote. A far more important marginal for the Conservatives, where local organisers believe the ethnic vote is crucial in deciding the outcome, is Walsall South, which has been troubled by Labour in-fighting on the local authority. Tories are convinced that Labour's 2.2 per cent majority is vulnerable and are targeting the Asian vote - which they say shifted towards the Tories in the last local elections. Mr Najabit Ali, a working-class Asian Moslem and Conservative party member since 1977, is about to be made redundant when the Walsall company for which he works closes down. But he does not blame the government, and has no plans to switch allegiances. 'I used to vote Labour but now I think my interests are best-served by the Conservatives,' he says. Apart from Nottingham East, other Conservative marginals where the ethnic vote could be significant include Birmingham Selly Oak and Slough. The Asian-born Conservative candidate who appears to have the best chance of success is Mr Nirj Deva, the Sri Lankan-born company director and Bow Group chairman defending a 7,953 majority in the Brentford and Isleworth seat formerly held by Sir Barney Hayhoe, who has retired. The issue may be less whether people of Asian origin will vote Tory, more whether Tories will vote Asian. Research suggests that the ethnic background of a candidate has little bearing on voting intentions. A survey commissioned by the Runnymede Trust last year found that 86 per cent of white people would vote for British citizens of Asian origin standing for a party of their choice. The 11 per cent who declared themselves less likely to vote for an Asian candidate could be significant in Langbaurgh in the north-east, a constituency with few ethnic voters, won from the Tories by Labour's Mr Ashok Kumar in the November 1991 by-election but with less of a swing than had been predicted.</p>

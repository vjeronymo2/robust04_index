On the first occasion, an AP wire dispatch reported on 7  March 1991 that Washington "stated today in an official report  the antidrug campaign initiated by Cuba almost two years ago in  its territorial waters and airspace has aided in reducing  narcotrafficking in the Caribbean."    The State Department report, always cited by AP, admitted  that in 1990 "the Cuban Government continued to maintain its  policy of denying Cuban airspace and territory to the (narco)  traffickers, and there was broad evidence of its efforts begun  in mid-1989 which curbed drug trafficking."    Later, on 12 April 1993, a NOTIMEX wire dispatch reported:    "A U.S. State Department report published earlier this month  recognizes Cuba's cooperation in controlling drug trafficking in  1992."    "The Cuban Government continues to give a high profile to  its  antidrug policy, part of which has been substantiated by  actions, the U.S. branch report stated."    Now, on Monday, the Spanish news agency EFE announced from  Washington that a U.S. State Department report on international  narcotrafficking stated the Cuban Government continues to grant  priority to its antidrug policy and that in 1993 it cooperated  with the United States, "the largest drug consumer in the world."    That same document admitted that in the past five years,  heroin consumption increased in the United States. The document  noted that due to this, heroin narcotrafficking in Latin America  has been diversified.    According to the U.S. State Department, of all the threats  entailed in drug trafficking the greatest is its unlimited  capability to corrupt institutions, among other things, because  only the value of the drugs confiscated in the United States is  superior to the gross internal product (GIP) of many countries  of the hemisphere.    Amid this assessment, the U.S. Government added in the  report  published this week that Cuba signed the UN 1988 Drug Convention  and "is working to fulfill many of the convention's objectives."    Interestingly enough, the U.S. State Department assessment  finds somehow that Cuba's antidrug-trafficking efforts may  possibly have not been more extensive because of the blockade  imposed by the White House on the island more than three decades  ago.    In this sense, the official analysis notes that the scarcity  of fuel and essential spare parts limits the Cuban Government's  ability to intercept drug traffickers.    As known--it has been generally promoted by the extreme  rightist sectors of Miami and other Conservative groups in the  United States--one of the campaigns used insistently against  Cuba internationally has been to link it with narcotrafficking.    This is the third report issued by the U.S. State Department  on the topic since 1991 in which objectivity prevails above any  distorting propaganda. The report offers a highly valuable tool  to anyone who seeks to assess the seriousness of arguments used  by Cuba at the time that it has to explain its actions or refute  those who professionally attempt around the clock to distort its  present situation.</p>

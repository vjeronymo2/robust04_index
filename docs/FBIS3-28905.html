The statement  said that Li's visit, although in the name of "holiday making,"  was actually aimed at developing substantive relations with  Indonesia and to create a situation of "two Chinas" in the world.    The five-day visit which began Feb. 9 violated Indonesia's  commitment on the "one-China policy" undertaken at the time when  diplomatic relations between Indonesia and China were resumed.    The China Government has lodged a strong protest against the  Indonesian Goverment on the incident. The embassy statement  further said the China Government hoped that the Indonesian  Government would uphold overall interest in safeguarding the  Sino-Indonesian friendly relations and cooperation. They also  called for efforts to stand on-guard against the political  designs of the "southward policy" pursued by the Taiwan  authorities.</p>

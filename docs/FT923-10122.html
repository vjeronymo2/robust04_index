			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow higher in spite of retreating bond prices Wall Street US EQUITIES managed to finish moderately higher yesterday after shrugging off a mixed bag of economic news, a downturn in the domestic bond market and lower stock markets in Europe, writes Karen Zagor in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 12.70 at 3,391.89 after the previous two-day upsurge of 97 points. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 eclipsed Wednesday's record level, ending 1.69 stronger at 423.92, while the Nasdaq composite appreciated 1.31 to 578.80. Turnover on the New York SE was a fairly heavy 193.4m shares, but well below the previous day's 276m. Equities put on a reasonable performance in the face of a retreat by the bond market, where the benchmark 30-year issue lost ground through most of the day before turning slightly higher in late trading. There was little reaction to economic news, which included a larger than expected fall in unemployment claims for the week ended July 18, a surprisingly strong improvement in new home sales for June, an unexpectedly low reading for second quarter Gross Domestic Product and an encouraging inflation report. Equimark soared in NYSE trading after the Pennsylvania commercial banking group said it had agreed to be acquired by Integra Financial through a Dollars 296m stock swap. Equimark's stock was quoted at Dollars 6 5/8 , up Dollars 1 1/8 , while Integra fell Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 36 1/8 in Nasdaq trading. ICI ADRs jumped Dollars 5 5/8 to Dollars 89 3/4 . The UK chemical company reported a 33 per cent decline in second quarter pre-tax earnings and said it might spin off its bioscience division. Alliant Techsystems tumbled Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 21 3/8 on the back of first quarter earnings from continuing operations of 59 cents a share, down from Dollars 1.58 a year earlier. UAL, parent of United Airlines, advanced Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 114 in spite of a second quarter loss of Dollars 3.94 a share, compared with earnings of Dollars 2.23 a year earlier. AMR, parent of American Airlines, gained Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 67 1/8 and Delta Airlines rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 56. Canada TORONTO ended a shade firmer after moderate trading. The TSE 300 index gained just 1.0 at 3,425.6 and rises held a small lead over declines by 288 to 243 after volume of 24.3m shares valued at CDollars 226.2m. PWA, which plunged CDollars 2.92 over the past two sessions, picked up 26 cents to CDollars 2.34. The drop in the share price was sparked by the failure of its talks with American Airlines, and the belief that Air Canada might buy the best assets of PWA's Canadian Airlines unit, leaving little for shareholders. Air Canada regained 5 cents to CDollars 5. Noranda, up CDollars  1/8 at CDollars 19 3/8 , announced higher second quarter and six-month earnings and a regular quarterly dividend of 25 cents; there had been rumors that a dividend cut was being considered.</p>

			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / GA announces higher payouts on 25-year endowment policies GENERAL Accident, the composite insurance group, yesterday announced the highest payouts so far this year for 25-year with-profits endowment policies. Several life offices this week announced cuts in the bonuses they pay to policyholders, but GA increased its 25-year payout by 0.3 per cent to Pounds 65,464, using the standard industry assumption that policies are started by a 29-year-old man paying Pounds 30 per month. It altered its bonus structure in a way which reduced payouts for shorter-term policies while increasing them for longer-term endowments. This led to a cut in payout on 10-year policies of 6.2 per cent to Pounds 6,590, using the above assumptions. Norwich Union cut similar payouts 7.2 per cent to Pounds 6,992, but Sun Alliance cut its 10-year payout by almost 15 per cent to Pounds 6,005, the lowest so far announced. Mr David Heslop, GA Life's marketing manager, said: 'Last year was actually a very good year. We estimate the return on our fund for 1992 at around 18 per cent. In those circumstances we did not see any reason why we should have to adjust our long-term maturity values.' GA claims it has reached its current position because it conserved its financial strength during the years of strong investment performance in the mid-1980s, and did not 'strive to be one of the very top players'. Several actuaries claim that payouts, particularly for short-term policies, were too high for 1990, when the stock market dropped during the year. Many firms assumed this was a aberration and raised payouts. For 10-year policies this means that payouts on policies exceed the share of the fund's assets allocated to them. Mr Philip Scott, investment manager of Norwich Union, said that payouts for NU exceeded their asset share by 'about 10 per cent', but he pointed out that the figure was dependent on volatile stock markets. Mr Charles Cannon, of actuaries Mercer Fraser, calculates that across the industry, payouts on short-term contracts exceed their asset share by between 10 and 20 per cent. GA admits its payouts are slightly in excess of their asset share. Sun Alliance says its payouts are now fully backed by assets.</p>

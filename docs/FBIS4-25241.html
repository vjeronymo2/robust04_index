			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By commentators Li Hongbo (2621 3163 3134) and Yan Kalin </F> (7051 0595 2651): "Correctly Evaluate Current Economic  Situation, Push Ahead With Reform, and Open Up With Full  Confidence"]    [Text] Since the beginning of this year, China's reform,  opening up, and economic development have proceeded at a fairly  fast pace and the achievements have been outstanding. How is  the general situation at present? How should we observe some  problems existing in economic life? It is necessary to make a  serious assessment and analysis.    The word "situation" is a dynamic concept. In observing and  evaluating a situation it is first necessary to look at the  overall situation, the principal aspects, and the development.    This year is a crucial one for China to push ahead reform,  opening up, and economic construction. Since the beginning of  this year, not only has a series of major reform measures, such  as finance, taxation, banking, and foreign exchange, been  adopted in turn according to plan but the progress has been  smooth as a whole. News from relevant departments shows that,  under the new tax system, the financial revenue and expenditure  between January and April kept on growing normally and the  budget execution was in keeping with the requirements. In  banking reform, the state development bank has been officially  set up and intensified preparations are under way to set up  other policy-related banks. In reforming the foreign exchange  management structure, the unification of the exchange rate was  completed in the first quarter of this year and the bank's  foreign exchange settlement and sales system was implemented on  1 April; there have been brisk transactions between domestic and  foreign-funded banks, with settlements outstripping sales of  foreign exchange. The reforms and experiments on establishing a  modern enterprise system are also under way. The steady advance  of these in-depth reform measures indicates that China has taken  solid steps in establishing a socialist market economy.    Meanwhile, the overall situation in the national economic  operations shows signs of improvement. In the first quarter,  the economic growth rate maintained fairly rapid growth in the  midst of a steady drop, agricultural production gradually heated  up, industrial production grew steadily, and the domestic market  was basically stable. For over 90 percent of commodities in  different varieties, there was still a balance between supply  and demand or an excess of supply over demand.    At this time last year, just as the Chinese economy was  overheated, not only was there a seething fever in real estate,  stocks, and development zones, which threw the banking order  into chaos, but there was also an excessive investment scale in  capital construction and an excessive industrial growth rate,  thus increasing the inflationary pressure. People were very  worried about this and it was against this backdrop that a  series of macroeconomic regulation and control measures was  introduced. Compared with the situation last year, it should be  said that the current economic situation in China and its  development prospects are fairly bright.    First, the growth in investment has been curbed. Since the  beginning of this year, the extent of state investment has  dropped by 30.5 percentage points over the same period last  year. The availability of funds for key projects, as well as  the overall investment pattern, is better than last year.  Through further efforts, the investment scale for the whole  year can basically be kept within an anticipated scope.    Second, the banking situation remains stable. The currency  which the banks put into circulation at the beginning of this  year has been recovered and the savings deposits of urban and  rural residents in the first four months of this year increased  by over 130 billion yuan over the same period last year. By  early May, over half of the task of issuing national banks had  been accomplished.    Third, market prices are rising at a gradually reducing  rate.  Through such measures as stepping up supervision over the prices  of daily necessities and service fees, practicing the method of  selling at marked prices, and launching a general price  inspection, the retail prices have risen at a markedly reduced  rate. According to predictions by departments in charge of  comprehensive economic management, the price index will drop  still further in the second half of this year.    Fourth, the national economy is growing steadily. As the  contradictions between supply and demand in communications,  energy, and raw materials ease up and investment remains within  a certain scope, there have been some changes in the shortages  of circulating capital. Consequently, the economic growth rate  will not be too low this year. According to initial predictions  by a relevant department, the national economy will grow by  about 12 percent in the first half of this year over the same  period last year and the growth rate for the whole year will  generally remain at about 10 percent.    Fifth, and a very important point, is that the economic  reform has continuously deepened. A central leading comrade has  used a vivid metaphor: China's economic restructuring has  shifted from the demolition of an old house to the construction  of a new one. The enterprise reform has moved from readjustment  of the tax reduction and profit concession policy to the  innovation of policies at a deeper level; the price reform has  moved from the liberalization of commodity prices to the  marketization of factor prices; and the construction of a market  system has moved from the selective cultivation of a commodity  market to a factor market. It can well be said that our reform  today is being carried out in an orderly way in accordance with  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics, the goal laid down by the 14th CPC  National Congress and the blueprint sketched out at the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee.    To sum up, everything has been done to cool down what should  be cooled down, to heat up what should be heated up, to lower  what should be lowered, and to raise what should be raised.  These are precisely the fundamental bases for a correct  understanding of the economic situation. When we push ahead  with reform, opening up, and economic construction on such a  basis, the vast numbers of cadres and masses will certainly have  a firmer resolve and will keep on marching.    The current overall situation in reform and opening up is  fairly good. However, the better the situation, the more we  should keep a clear head and seriously solve the problems  existing in the course of economic growth. Some time ago,  people were quite concerned about whether inflation could be  curbed. With the market and prices tending to stabilize, the  difficulties of some state-owned enterprises in their operations  and production have drawn people's attention again. How should  we approach this? As we see it, beside taking the overall  situation into account and grasping the situation of economic  operations as a whole, we should also examine and analyze  specific issues in light of the overall situation.    There are now two different one-sided views: The first is  that state-owned enterprises are losing more money and their  speed has reduced; the second is that the shortage of  circulating capital has resulted in many enterprises suspending  production. As for the first view, the relevant departments  have made an analysis to the effect that, after the  implementation of the new fiscal system and after many  state-owned enterprises with good economic results have been  turned into joint ventures or joint-stock enterprises, there  have been changes in both the calculation methods and  statistical specifications; in fact, the losses have not  increased and nor has the speed reduced. As for the second  view, the actual situation is: In the first four months of this  year, the production in state-owned enterprises still grew at  4.7 percent. As production and development are not at a  standstill, how can there be a situation in which many  enterprises have stopped or partially stopped production? If we  judge the situation one-sidedly according to these arguments and  relax controls over credits, it is likely that the circulating  funds will again be diverted to investment in fixed assets, thus  encouraging a new investment expansion, and the actual effect of  macroeconomic regulation and control will probably come to  naught.    It should be noted that some state-owned enterprises have  indeed met with difficulties in their operations and production.  The reasons have something to do with the structure and other  aspects, such as excessive social burdens, unchanged product  mix, and lax internal management. In essence, it is because the  operation mechanism of some enterprises has not been fully  changed or has not been changed at all. More often than not,  the difficult point in economic development is the focus of  reform. Only by accelerating the change of enterprise mechanism  and of government functions will it be possible for state-owned  enterprises to overcome, once and for all, some of their  difficulties and for the economic situation to develop in a  better direction.    Our country is in a very important stage of development. The  task of deepening the reform is very arduous and it needs  tremendous efforts to achieve the sustained, rapid, and healthy  development of the national economy. Therefore, it is  especially important to see the situation clearly and grasp the  overall situation. To look is aimed at doing. It is hoped that  the vast numbers of cadres, workers, and staff members on the  economic front will rouse themselves, unite as one and, while  focussing on the basic principle of seizing the opportune  moment, deepening the reform, opening wider to the outside  world, promoting development, and maintaining stability, seize  new victories in socialist modernization with full confidence.</p>

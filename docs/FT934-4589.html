			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / OECD urges Japan to reform finance Japan must make radical financial reforms and curb regulations that cause artificially high prices if it is to achieve sustainable non-inflationary growth. A gradual rise in taxes and social security contributions will also be needed to prevent an explosion of public debt, as an ageing population drains the social security budget and reduces government income tax revenues. These are the sobering conclusions of yesterday's annual report on Japan by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development, which adds intellectual authority to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's attempts to achieve deregulation against resistance from powerful vested interests. It also backs up the Finance Ministry's campaign for a wide-ranging tax reform to spread the burden of income tax more widely and to obtain a greater share of tax revenues from consumption tax. Like the Japanese government, the OECD was wrong-footed by the strength of the recession. The report predicts zero growth in gross domestic product this year, down from its original 2.5 per cent growth forecast, and forecasts that the economy will grow by 1.4 per cent in 1994. But since the report was compiled in September, OECD officials have downgraded their forecasts again, to less than zero growth this year and well below 1 per cent next. 'Developments since the preparation of the report have been significant,' said Mr Kumi Shigehara, the OECD's chief economist, yesterday. Unlike previous recessions, this one was caused by domestic upsets - the unsustainable asset price and investment boom of the late 1980s - which take time to put right, says the report. The yen's unexpected strength this year added a new shock. Unemployment will rise from 2.5 per cent this year to 2.9 per cent next, while inflation will slow from 1 per cent this year to 0.4 per cent, forecasts the OECD. The balance of payments surplus, will peak at a record Dollars 140.8bn this year and recede to Dollars 139.7bn in 1994. US pressure for numerical import targets to reduce the surplus is dangerous because such targets would encourage cartels and distract efforts to deregulate and boost competition in sheltered industries, the OECD warns. The weakness of the banking system, hit by the need to write off a growing pile of bad debts, has not so far proved a serious restraint on recovery, because credit demand has been even weaker than supply, despite the Bank of Japan's cuts in the official discount rate to new lows. But the OECD fears the banks' cost of own funds could rise as they exhaust sources of capital, so driving up corporate finance costs. A sustained stock market rise would relieve the squeeze on the banks' capital base. One answer would be to make the stock market more attractive to individuals by improving corporate disclosure, increasing dividends and deregulating commission rates, says the OECD. The key to stimulating domestic demand - set to grow by a mere 0.1 per cent this year - in the medium term is to sweep away regulations that distort land, housing and food prices. This would also help to reduce Japan's high savings rate, criticised by trade partners as a factor in the high trade surplus, the organisation argues. The study says the government should derive a higher proportion of state income from consumption tax. It stops short of calling for a substantial income tax cut, seen by Japanese business lobbies as the only way to stimulate demand, though it does believe income tax schedules for heavily taxed middle-income earners could be reduced. Today, the Japanese government gets 68.3 per cent of its tax revenues from income tax - as against the 38.5 per cent OECD average. The burden on income tax payers will increase as the percentage of people over 65 rises from just over 12 per cent now to 25.5 per cent in 2020. There would be scope for a reduction in rates if the income tax base was widened, to include 'more effective' taxes on capital gains. Consumption tax, at 3 per cent is very low by international standards, and inefficiently collected. Simplified consumption tax accounting rules for businesses were introduced to make this tax less unpopular on its launch in 1988, but the 60 per cent of traders which qualify for simplified procedures tend to underpay.

Gyaincain Norbu, deputy secretary of the autonomous regional  party committee and chairman of the autonomous region, delivered  a speech in which he summed up the meeting by stressing major  tasks for the region this winter and next spring. His speech  covers four aspects: first, the main results of the meeting;  second, problems concerning how to convey and carry out the  guiding spirit of the meeting; third, major tasks to be carried  out this winter and next spring; and fourth, problems concerning  how to improve the work style and strengthen the campaign of  building a clean government.    Attending the meeting were leaders of the autonomous  regional  party committee including Raidi, Guo Jinlong, Danzim, Yang  Chuantang, Buqiong, and Li Guangwen, Political Commissar Hu  Yongzhu of the Tibet Military District, leading cadres of  provincial-level party members, standing members of the regional  commission for discipline inspection, and all the comrades who  attended the fifth plenary (enlarged) session of the fourth  regional party committee.    Raidi, executive deputy secretary of the autonomous regional  party committee Standing Committee, presided over the meeting.    The meeting conveyed the guiding spirit of the Third Plenary  Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, the meeting of the  CPC Central Committee on rural work, and the national meeting on  the work of united fronts. It examined a report by the CPC  Advisory Group of the Tibet Autonomous Region and adopted a  resolution that such a group will no longer be established.  Raidi, executive deputy secretary of the autonomous regional  party committee Standing Committee, offered a report entitled  "Conscientiously Study and Comprehensively Carry Out the Guiding  Spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee and Work Hard To Establish a Socialist Market Economic  System."    The meeting concentrated on great events and political  affairs. It was a meeting for unifying thinking, enhancing  understanding, sizing up the situation, fostering faith, and  strengthening the sense of urgency in seizing opportunities in  order to lay a solid ideological foundation for accelerating the  pace of reform, opening up, and economic development. It was  also for emancipating the mind, invigorating the spirit, and  promoting unity and progress.    Talking about the major results of this meeting during his  speech, Deputy Secretary Gyaincain Norbu said: The greatest  result of this meeting is that we have enhanced understanding,  unified thinking, reached a consensus, fostered faith, and  strengthened the sense of urgency in building a socialist market  economic system. Major expressions of the meeting can be found  in further deepening the understanding of the necessity to build  a socialist market economic system, in defining the basic  principle of accelerating the pace of reform and opening up as  well as establishing a socialist market economic system in our  region, in finding out the gap, and in strengthening the sense  of responsibility and urgency in accelerating the reform and  promoting the economic development. Major expressions of the  meeting can also be found in further understanding the  importance of the role of farming and animal husbandry as the  foundation of the national economy, in paying attention to two  important things [economic development and stable situation]  simultaneously, and in strengthening and improving party  leadership.    Comrade Gyaincain Norbu added: During the discussion, all of  us have profoundly felt that the largest obstacle in  establishing a socialist market economic system lies in ideology  and in understanding problems. Our comrades said that in  changing the economic system, it is necessary to first change  our thinking. Only by following the standards of the "three  conducive causes" ["conducive to developing the productive  forces of our socialist society, increasing the overall strength  of our socialist country, and improving the people's living  standards"], by being bold in our endeavors and experiments, and  by working hard under the new system, can we realize the goal of  achieving new results in our economic and social development.  We all believed we can achieve social stability and national  prosperity based on strong material foundation only by seizing  opportunities and unswervingly carrying out the drive of reform,  opening up, and modernization. He continued: All comrades  believed the greatest gap between the region and the hinterland  and coastal areas lies in emancipating the mind; in having a  sense of urgency; in carrying out the tasks; in over-emphasizing  the special conditions in Tibet; and in our tendency to "wait,  depend on, and ask for" subsidies from central authorities. If  we do not change this situation, we will bring about even  greater passive and graver consequences. As leading cadres of  the party, we have great responsibility during the course of  establishing a new system. We should take the lead in our  march, seize opportunities, and organize and lead the people in  our great drive of reform and opening up.    Deputy Secretary Gyaincain Norbu said: During the course of  building a socialist market economic system, it is imperative to  attach great importance to the role of farming and animal  husbandry as the foundation of the national economy, follow the  guiding spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC  Central Committee and the Meeting of the CPC Central Committee  on rural work, continue to maintain the party's basic policy in  agricultural and pastoral areas, unswervingly deepen the reform  of the economic system in rural areas, and promote rapid and  sound economic development in agricultural and pastoral areas.  We should firmly foster the ideology of paying equal attention  to two important things, that is, economic development and  stable situation, actively launch the campaign of  anti-splittism, and create favorable a social environment for  establishing a socialist market economic system and accelerating  the pace of reform and economic development in our region.    While talking about how to convey the guiding spirit of this  meeting, Comrade Gyaincain Norbu said: The Fifth Plenary  (Enlarged) Session of the Fifth Autonomous Regional CPC  Committee is an important meeting, representing the fact that  our region has entered a critical stage in carrying out reform  of the economic system. Therefore, it is extremely important to  do a good job in conveying the guiding spirit of the meeting.  The general requirement for this work is to conscientiously  study the documents, formulate concrete measures, and guarantee  comprehensive implementation. The major goals of our work lie  in profoundly understanding the great significance of the  "decision" [decision of the CPC Central Committee on some issues  concerning the establishment of a socialist market economic  structure] and its essence, in correctly appreciating the  necessity of establishing a socialist market economic system in  our region, in comprehensively understanding the thread of  thought, major principle, and main tasks of the reform of the  economic system in our region, and in sizing up the situation,  seizing the opportunities to accelerate the reform and economic  development. He also urged leaders at all levels to study and  formulate a plan for accelerating the drive of reform and  opening by taking into consideration actual conditions of their  localities and departments. He said that it is necessary to  attach importance to making gradual progress in reform and to  losing no opportunities in achieving breakthroughs in important  links so as to spur the whole situation of reform.    Concerning some major tasks to be performed in this winter  and next spring, Deputy Secretary Gyaincain Norbu said: It is a  completely new undertaking to build a socialist market economic  system. We need a great theory as our guidance. Great efforts  should be made to systematically study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and  the "decision." At present, it is particularly important to  study well Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping. He stressed: The economic work of our region  this winter, next spring, and next year should be carried out in  accordance with the guiding spirit of the Third Plenary Session  of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the National Meeting on  Economic Work. It is necessary to continue to strengthen the  role of farming and animal husbandry as the foundation of  national economy, concentrate on increasing the incomes of  people living in agricultural and pastoral areas, strengthen the  leadership over the work in agricultural and pastoral areas,  exert great efforts in developing village and town enterprises,  increase input in farming and animal husbandry, attach  importance to the fundamental construction of water conservancy  projects in farmland and grassland, pay attention to  disaster-prevention and disaster-relief, and make a good  arrangement for the requirements of people's livelihood so as to  lay a foundation for reaping a good harvest in farming and  animal husbandry next year. Various enterprises at all levels  should concentrate on enhancing economic results, improving  management, tightening disciplines so as to accomplish this  year's production quotas and lay a good foundation for the  management of next year's production. Comrade Gyaincain Norbu  said: In carrying out the reform of the economic system in our  region, it is necessary to insist on the standard of productive  force, seize the opportunities, exert an all-out effort, and  make breakthroughs in some key points. We should maintain steps  in unison with other parts of the country in improving our  system. We should proceed from Tibet's realities and make active  and stable efforts in our work. Greater efforts should be made  to accelerate the pace of reform in nine aspects, including  state-owned enterprises, finance and taxation, banking industry,  price, economic relations and trade, circulation, housing  system, social protection, as well as work in farming and  pastoral areas.    Comrade Cyaincain Norbu pointed out: Reform, development,  and social stability are interactive and mutually supplementary.  In order to guarantee the smooth implementation of reform next  year, it is imperative to pay attention to the following points:  Prevent splittist elements at home and abroad from instigating  riots among people by making use of reform and price reform in  particular; it is necessary to take into consideration the  state's guiding spirit of reform, conduct thorough investigation  and analysis of the realities in our region, and extensively  seek opinions of all circles while formulating a plan for  reform; and, before introducing a reform policy, try to do a  good job in propaganda work among people so as to make them  understand, support, and participate in such reform. During his  speech, Comrade Cyaincain Norbu also said: In carrying out the  tough work of anti-corruption, it is necessary to resolutely  implement the directives of the CPC Central Committee and the  Central Commission for Discipline Inspection concerning opposing  corruption and rectifying the work style of the party,  strengthen the clean-government drive, and ensure to achieve the  current-stage results of anti-corruption.    In conclusion, Comrade Cyaincain Norbu said: The upcoming  year of 1994 is extremely important for our region to carry out  the socialist modernization drive. Party organizations at all  levels should work with best spirit and lead people of all  nationalities in the region in establishing a socialist market  economic system and accomplishing other tasks.    The meeting was concluded with the majestic music of the  "Internationale" at 11:30 in the morning.</p>

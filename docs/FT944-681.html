			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Upturn at Jones &amp; Shipman A 'welcome and sustained' upturn in demand helped Jones &amp; Shipman, the machine tool manufacturer, to cut pre-tax losses from Pounds 973,000 to Pounds 897,000 in the six months to September 30. This upturn, however, had only a limited effect on turnover - up from Pounds 5.41m to Pounds 6.13m - because of the nature of lead times across the company's product range, said Mr Len Weaver, chairman. Losses emerged at 3.5p (8p) per share and the company's shares closed up 1p to 30p.</p>

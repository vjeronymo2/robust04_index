			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris eases back in light continental volume TURNOVER remained light on the Continent as investors considered their options for 1992, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS ran into profit-taking after its Christmas rally but ended off the day's lowest level. The CAC 40 index went as low as 1,771.83 before closing 8.84 down at 1,778.73. Turnover was estimated at FFr1.65bn after Monday's FFr1.75bn. Foreigners were conspicuous by their absence. Euro Disney was one of the day's most active stocks, falling FFr3 to FFr148 with 625,100 shares traded, on active profit-taking after its recent rise. However, brokers were still positive on the stock. SG Warburg has issued a 'buy' note on the Euro Disney convertible. Oil and engineering shares were also lower, with Total losing FFr25 to 1,017 and Alcatel down FFr11 to FFr554. FRANKFURT again found itself with nothing to bite on and the DAX index fell 10.87 to 1,592.45 after a 3.72 decline to 648.88 in the FAZ at midsession. Volume rose from DM3bn to DM3.5bn. Dealers said that after a limited acknowledgment of the spurt on Wall Street, which helped holders of German shares adjust to year-end capital gains tax positions, the market was reverting to normal - which, said one, would mean it would follow the Dow on the downgrade much more comfortably than it had done in the recent rally. There was price movement in carmakers where Daimler fell DM9 to DM741 and Porsche put on DM8.50 to DM576 on the recent weakness of the dollar. VW dropped another DM6 to DM292, leaving it DM14.60 lower over the last three sessions. Most of the decline has followed the weekend revelation that output of VW's Golf model is likely to have fallen by 100,000 units last year, due to the change-over to a new design. MILAN saw some interest in banking and telecommunications stocks but trading was thin despite the return of traders and fund managers from holiday. The Comit index rose 6.48 to 514.29 in turnover estimated at not more than Friday's L46.2bn. The bourse was closed yesterday. Trading was hampered by the teething problems of the new trading houses or Sims which came into operation at the start of this year. Italian investment fund data for December were hardly encouraging, with both equity and mixed funds continuing to suffer from redemptions. Mediobanca, which has been recommended as a 'buy' by Goldman Sachs, rose L460 to L14,200. The broker expects the bank's earnings to grow by 23 per cent in 1992 after a 5 per cent decline in 1991. Among telecoms, Stet rose L70 to L2,170. AMSTERDAM ended a dull session mixed to easier. The CBS Tendency index closed at 113.4, down 0.2 on the day. The trading company Hagemeyer added Fl 3 to Fl 126.50 in response to the company's New Year message that there would be a big rise in 1991 earnings per share from 1990's Fl 12.59. Wessanen added Fl 1.50 to Fl 82.50 after the company said that 1991 earnings per share are likely to be 16 per cent higher than in 1990. ZURICH ended above its lows as the Credit Suisse index fell 3.9 to 455.7, and turnover to pre-holiday levels. Industrials stayed in focus with the watchmaker, SMH, bucking the trend, its certificates closing SFr20 better at SFr700. MADRID saw the general index 3.03 higher at 246.68. Banks and utilities led the uptrend in volume of around Pta12bn against Pta8bn last Friday. STOCKHOLM produced a spike in turnover, which rocketed from SKr251m to an all-time high of SKr1.26bn. This was attributed to Sandvik's sale of its entire 10.1 per cent stake in Investment AB Bahco to the holding company Industrivarden. The Affarsvarlden General index closed 6.8 higher at 928.3. Bahco unrestricted B shares closed at SKr275, in line with the sweetened bid made by Industrivarden for all outstanding Bahco Bs. COPENHAGEN continued its modest, but consistent uptrend with the CSE index 1.32 higher at 358.66 and the biotech favourite, Novo Nordisk, among the leaders with a DKr8 rise to DKr558. OSLO slid on profit-taking, the all-share index closing 1.92 lower at 430.95, reflecting declines in the industry and shipping indices and another minor recovery in banks. VIENNA rose in lively trading as domestic and foreign investors picked up bargains after the sustained decline in the latter part of 1991. The ATX index jumped 20.72 or 2.3 per cent to 922.36. BRUSSELS continued to focus on retailers. GIB rose BFr30 to BFr1,232 with a heavy 68,800 shares traded following the sale of its 50 per cent stake in a chain of pizza restaurants in Belgium and Holland. Delhaize eased BFr20 to BFr8,630. The Bel-20 index closed 1.48 higher at 1,106.01 in turnover of BFr693m.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - JAN 7  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes Open     10 am    11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     Close 1087.90  1087.77  1087.49  1087.14  1086.02  1086.76  1086.22  1086.06           Day's High  1088.32    Day's Low  1085.62  Jan 6     Jan 3     Jan 2     Dec 31     Dec 30  1092.05   1087.01   1078.19   1079.41++  1065.54 Base value 1000 (26/10/90). ++Partial.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

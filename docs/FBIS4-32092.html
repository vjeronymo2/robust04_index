			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Marian Dudinsky: "The Zuzana Howitzer Is </F> Selling Like Hotcakes; World Hit of Slovak Arms Industry  Presented at Jelsava"]    [Excerpts] A major festivity took place at the 3d  Artillery Brigade at Jelsava the day before yesterday. Three  "generals" of the present Slovak Army were presented to the  public there, two of whom are women! The first is ZUZANA  [Slovak form of "Susanne"], the second DANA, and the third is  Rocket Launcher--Model 70. It is self-evident that we are  talking about arms systems in our Army's arsenal, among which  "Sue," a self-propelled cannon howitzer, is the absolute hit. A  lot of praise has been heaped on it at all international  exhibitions at which it has been presented lately.    The 155-mm caliber, the very caliber that is also used by  NATO armies, and the range of 40 kilometers, a distance for  which air reconnaissance is required, place this weapon among  the leading ranks in the world at present. This is also  confirmed by the preliminary price of 30 million korunas [Sk],  or $1 million (for potential foreign customers), per unit. Of  course, this price is based on the assumption that we will be  able to produce at least 100 pieces a year and that production  starts immediately! Waiting in this area means waiting for  bankruptcy. India alone has shown interest in 400 of these  howitzers.... And other interested parties are legion.    The second "general" is ZUZANA's predecessor, a 152-mm  self-propelled cannon howitzer, model 77, code named "DANA."  Its range is "only" 20 kilometers, but, during its  presentation, one's ears, though plugged, were ringing  handsomely. The assertion seems to be true that it may be  enough to erect 10 to 20 of these monsters at the battlefield to  deafen the enemy troops. They cost about Sk10 million apiece.    The 122-mm rocket launcher, model 70, is mounted on a Tatra  813 chassis and equipped with 40 rockets (known as improved  "katushas" [World War II Soviet-made rocket launchers]). Its  range is also approximately 20 kilometers, but its price is a  mere Sk7.5 million. However, a single shot costs up to Sk20,000!  [passage omitted]    As is to be seen, Slovak arms manufacturers are beginning to  recover from the woeful heritage of conversion imposed by Havel  and to return to markets from which they had been pushed out by  the so-called humanitarian ethics of federal policy, which  pharisaically applied only to Slovakia....    [Bratislava SLOVENSKA REPUBLIKA in Slovak on 18 June on page  3 carries a 150-word "r"-attributed report entitled "Targeted on  Howitzers." According to the report, in a statement provided to  SLOVENSKA REPUBLIKA, Colonel Tomas Svec, chief of the Public  Relations Department at the Army Command of the Slovak Republic,  corrected the information contained in the above report as  follows: "The Zuzana self-propelled cannon howitzer is not in  the arsenal of the Army of the Slovak Republic. The Army  intends, however, to introduce it into its arsenal, as was also  stated at Jelsava by the commander of the Army of the Slovak  Republic. The information about Zuzana's price (Sk30 million)  is also incorrect. This price is a very rough estimate from  January 1993, when there was no experience with the development  and production of such a high-quality combat system. The actual  price is quite different."]</p>

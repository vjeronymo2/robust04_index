			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity market closes the week in good form - Market Report UK equities shrugged off the debilitating effects of weak international bond markets, as the big institutions preferred to concentrate on the positive news on the domestic economy rather than outside influences. But there was no denying that a steep decline in German bunds around lunchtime, and a weak performance by US bonds took some of the shine off the London market. UK gilts, which began the session in reasonably good shape, were sold off in mid-session after news that a leading member of the Bundesbank Council said he was keen to keep German interest at their present levels for the near future. Gilts rallied at the close, however, closing around six ticks higher on balance responding to news that there will be no gilts auction this month. The FT-SE 100 index closed 8.8 higher on the session at 3,191.4, thereby extending the rise on the week to one of 49.1. The FT-SE Mid 250 index, which had been left behind the senior FT-SE index for much of the week, staged a rapid advance, thanks largely to a scintillating performance by the utilities areas of the market. The regional electricity sector, easily the market's outstanding performer both before and after the electricity distribution review, galloped ahead with the Scottish generators and Northern Ireland Electricity, left behind by the English recs, catching the eye of the big institutional buyers. Panmure Gordon, the stockbroker, was again an aggressive supported of Scottish Hydro. Dealers said the big bull points in the recs included potential share buy backs, the probable sale of their stakes in the National Grid and increasing talk of the likelihood of stakebuilding and takeover bids in the sector. Turnover in equities jumped to a week's high of 853.3m shares, with non-FT-SE 100 stocks accounting for a much higher than usual 75 per cent of activity, largely thanks to a big cross in Dragon Oil, one of the market's penny stocks. turnover in Dragon was recorded at 263m shares, or 30 per cent of overall share volume. The value of customer business in the market on Thursday was recorded as Pounds 1.58bn, well up on recent levels. Share prices weakened at the outset of trading with marketmakers happy to chop their opening levels after a fairly hefty decline on Wall Street overnight, but quickly encountered support as the FT-SE future began to pick up and a number of marketmakers moved in to fill in some worrying short positions. But it was clear that the real upward push in the market came in the utilities areas. The expiry of index options was also seen as one of the driving forces in the market. The market moved into positive territory as the index options expired and thereafter made gradual progress, shrugging off the setback in gilts at the same time. There was no real lead for London from the US where Wall Street had posted a minor gain shortly after London closed. Equity market strategists continued to adopt a positive view of recent economic developments. Mr Richard Jeffrey at Charterhouse Tilney, the stockbroker, said: 'The equity market is in excellent shape; the only problem is the gilts market which doesn't seem to believe the inflation story in the UK. It is difficult to see equities making any significant progress until gilt yields fall by at least 50 points.' Mr Jeffrey said he remained happy with his year-end forecast of 3,600 on the FT-SE 100. Mr Jeffrey said he expected the public sector borrowing requirement for the year to undershoot, coming out in the low Pounds 30bns against a Government target in the high Pounds 30bns. 'The UK economy is probably the best performing economy of any of the leading international economies, ' he added.</p>

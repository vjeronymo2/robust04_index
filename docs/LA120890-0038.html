			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOMETHING GROSS ABOUT DODGER DEAL  </P> <P> Kevin Gross? Kevin Gross? That maniac Fred Claire is telling Fernando to hit  the bricks so the Dodgers can shell out big money to sign Kevin Gross? What, if  anything, has this guy ever done in his career? And why does Claire think he's  a suitable replacement for one of the most popular Dodgers of all time?  </P> <P> It would be funny if it wasn't so stupid.  </P> <P> JACK PERKINS  </P> <P> North Hollywood  </P></p>

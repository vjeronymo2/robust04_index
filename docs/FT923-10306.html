			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Clifford denies all BCCI charges Hitting back: Clark Clifford, the 85-year-old former US defence secretary, said yesterday there was 'not one scintilla of direct evidence or proof' that he had committed any of the crimes relating to the BCCI scandal for which he was indicted on Wednesday. At a news conference Mr Clifford vowed to fight the charges and attacked 'a gross unfairness in the manner in which the publicity about a criminal proceeding is brought'.

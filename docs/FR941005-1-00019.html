			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This criterion refers to the extent to which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessment base reflects the degree of risk posed to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deposit insurance funds. For example, there is a link  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between the existing assessment base, which is based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> total domestic deposits, and the magnitude of the loss the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failure of an institution could cause its deposit insurance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fund.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On the one hand, private insurance firms often base the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount of their premiums at least in part on the amount to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be paid out under the policy if the insured event  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transpires. This practice might suggest an assessment base  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consisting of insured deposits only. Such a definition also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be consistent with the primary purpose of federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deposit insurance as clarified by FDICIA_to protect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> insured deposits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On the other hand, existing public policy provides  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protection for liabilities other than insured deposits,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through such measures as depositor preference_which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provides some protection to non-insured domestic deposits_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and granting superior status to secured liabilities. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, to the extent that secured claims are elevated to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a position superior to that of insured deposits, the FDIC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may be at greater risk of not recovering the full amount of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its payout on insured deposits. Thus, assessment of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liabilities other than insured deposits is not inherently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inconsistent with the concept of defining the assessment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> base in terms of the magnitude of the risk posed to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDIC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Non-Avoidability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This criterion refers to the extent to which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessment base precludes or minimizes transactions or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustments made solely to avoid assessments. Under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing assessment base, which is defined in terms of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deposits held ``as of'' the last day of the quarter, avoidance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities usually involve the temporary transfer of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deposits out of an institution's deposit base for a brief  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period extending over quarter end.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One such example is the movement of deposits into non- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deposit instruments (such as notes or repurchase agreements)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within the same institution just prior to quarter end,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solely for the purpose of reducing the assessment paid by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the institution. The transferred funds are returned to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deposit accounts at the beginning of the next quarter, after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the ``as of'' date for determining the institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessment base.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another example, which involves the transfer of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deposits from one insured institution to another, does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affect the total amount of assessments collected by the FDIC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but rather forces the receiving institution to pay  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessments on deposits that would otherwise have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included in the transferring institution's assessment base.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In this example, deposits are transferred just prior to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quarter end from one institution to another. The transfer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is reversed shortly thereafter. The result is to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disadvantage the (probably unsuspecting) receiving  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution by increasing the deposit base on which its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessments are calculated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In both of these examples, the result is an artificial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> situation created solely for the purpose of avoiding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessments. Such situations could be mitigated by the use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of ``average'' data in defining the assessment base.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Recordkeeping Burden  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This criterion refers to the ease of maintaining and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reporting the data needed for computing an institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessment base. It encompasses the time and effort  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary for any additional recordkeeping beyond that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required of reporting entities for purposes other than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

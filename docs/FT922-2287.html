			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / International Company News: Provisions warning from Groupe Suez GROUPE SUEZ, one of France's largest industrial and financial groups, yesterday warned it would be hit by heavy property provisions this year, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris. Mr Gerard Worms, chairman, told the annual meeting it planned to buy out minority shareholders in the group's Compagnie Industrielle subsidiary. He said the economic environment remained 'unstable' and that Suez was having trouble in the property and small business sectors. Its shares slipped FFr11.80 to FFr302.20 on the announcement. Mr Worms did not specify the likely level of Suez' provisions for 1992. However Mr Patrick Ponsolle, managing director, said there was 'a risk' that Suez would be forced to make a similar level of property provisions as in 1991, when the total was more than FFr1.2bn (Dollars 227m). Meanwhile, Suez is continuing the strategy of tidying up its investment portfolio by buying out the minority investors that hold 3.8 per cent of Industrielle's shares. It is offering 11 shares in Victoire, an insurance company that it controls, for two Industrielle shares. Suez controls Industrielle with a 50.1 per cent holding. Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), its dual shareholder, has 46.1 per cent. UAP, which has been locked in negotiations with Suez to swap some of its Victoire shares for part of Colonia, a German insurer controlled by Victoire, has agreed to the proposed buy-out. ***** Deutsche Aerospace (DASA), the aerospace unit of Daimler-Benz, and Alenia, the Italian aerospace group, have formed a joint venture, Eurocolumbus Raumfahrtgesellschaft, to prepare for the European space laboratory, Columbus, Reuter reports from Berlin. Mr Juergen Schrempp, DASA management board chairman, said the venture would create the industrial conditions for the space station. He called on politicians to carry through the Dollars 5.3bn Columbus project. Eurocolumbus will be based in Bremen and have a branch in Torino, Italy. DASA's orbital infrastructure division, ERNO Raumfarhttechnik, will own 60 per cent of Eurocolumbus. Alenia's stake will be owned through its Alenia Spazio unit. France's Matra Marconi Space, a unit of defence and transport group, Matra, is expected to join the venture later. The venture will initially have 150 employees, who will be transferred from the parent companies. ***** Swissair is to implement further cost-cutting measures, including the elimination of 400 administrative jobs. Mr Otto Loepfe, president, said the move followed 'worldwide fare erosion', especially over the north Atlantic, AP-DJ reports from Zurich. Mr Loepfe reportedly told employees: 'We are going to have to face up to some lean times ahead. And it is the ones in the best shape that are going to come through.' Mentioning its existing cost-savings programme, dubbed 'Move,' the airline said it was taking 'additional steps to enhance its competitive edge'. The Move programme measures 'are to be further developed and implemented at an accelerated pace'.</p>

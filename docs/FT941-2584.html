			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Directors' transactions The Royal Bank of Scotland has featured before in this column when Peter Wood, who founded the Direct Line motor and household insurance subsidiary, bought almost 2m shares in December 1993. The share price was around 400p then and rose to a peak of 528p before coming back to the present 430p. Wood has been buying again. His most recent purchase of 562,000 shares brings his total holding to more than 3m. Directors of Rodime were last noted when three of them sold almost 2m shares at 44.75p. The outcome of several negotiations pending at that time are still anticipated. Nevertheless, director selling has continued. The same three directors, including chairman Malcolm McIver and managing director Peter Bailey, have sold more stock at the lower price of 30.75p. Each director still retains a sizeable holding. PizzaExpress announced much-improved final results in September 1993. MD David Page then sold 380,000 shares at 102p to meet obligations following the sale of G&amp;F Holdings to PizzaExpress. The most recent sales fall just before the beginning of the closed period and were carried out by three directors, including finance supremo Glen Tomlinson, at 132p a share.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                             No of Company                      Sector   Shares     Value   directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bolton Group                  Prop  1,515,150     500        2 Candover Investmnts           InvT     40,000     132        1 Castings                       Eng      8,000      20        1* Chemring Group                 Eng      7,400      25        1 Cook (William)                 Eng     20,000      60        2* De Morgan                     Prop     67,000      10        1 Hanson                        DivI     46,666     126        1* Kleinwort Benson              Mbnk      7,000      38        1 M &amp; W                         RetF    112,500     182        1* McAlpine                      BCon     40,000     126        1 Neepsend                       Eng    127,269      53        2 PizzaExpress                  L&amp;HI     25,000      33        3 Rank Organisation             L&amp;HI     54,289     583        2* Rodime                        OS&amp;B  1,927,076     593        3 Serco                         SSer     25,000     369        1 Shell Trans &amp; Trad            OilI     76,500     534        1* Tomkinsons                    HseG      3,500      11        1*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Abbey National                Bnks     10,000      49        1 Aberforth Smllr Cos           InvT      6,583      13        1 Abtrust New Dawn C            InvT      7,500      19        1 Brent Intrnl                  Chem     14,500      15        2 Cantab Pharmacls              Phrm     22,500     100        1 Close Brothers                Mbnk      4,000      22        2 Dundee &amp; London               InvT      4,000      13        1 Hillsdown Holdings            FdMa     90,000     144        5 MMT Computing                 SSer     16,245      27        1 Peel Holdings                 Prop     20,000      72        1 Rank Organisation             L&amp;HI      2,000      22        1 Royal Bk of Scot              Bnks    562,000   2,449        1 TI Group                       Eng      3,000      13        2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih,  chairman of the Presidential Council, yesterday met with the  brother ulema, men of religion, social figures; representatives  of political parties and popular and youth organizations, and  military men in al-Dali' District, who expressed to the brother  president their happiness over their meeting with him, as he is  a national symbol who has epitomized concern about the homeland  and its unity, who has proved his love for the people, and who  backs their causes and goals. They indicated that the residents  of the al-Dali' District, who have offered convoys of martyrs  and heroic strugglers to obtain freedom and achieve  independence, are willing to make dear sacrifices to safeguard  and strengthen Yemeni unity. They will also, they noted, lend  their wholehearted support for unity and legitimacy in  continuation of the struggles waged by the residents of the  al-Dali' District throughout their national struggle.    The al-Dali' District representatives reaffirmed their  readiness to make dear sacrifices to safeguard unity and  confront its enemies, whoever they may be. They noted that our  Yemeni people cannot survive without unity, which is our  people's fate and destiny. Similarly, there can be no future for  our Yemeni people without unity. They asserted that the  traitorous and agent rebels only represent their treacherous  psyches. Their objectives will never be achieved, they said.  Our people, and their Armed Forces will repulse their schemes,  which are hostile to the people and their unity.    The al-Dali' District representatives affirmed that unity  ended the fragmentation nightmare, as well as the tyrannical  party rule. They explained that the attempts to rehabilitate  fragmentation, regardless of the form this might take, and of  the person who might attempt this, is a betrayal of the people's  aspirations and struggles, and also of the sacrifices made by  their righteous martyrs. They added that the sons of the 26  September revolution and the 14 October revolution, and the  strugglers of the liberation war will be loyal to the principles  upheld by our people and their Armed Forces, chief among which  are the revolution and unity. They also noted the deceptive  propaganda promoted by the rebellious secessionists and the  erroneous misrepresentation of facts to citizens to delude the  public. They mentioned the torture and oppression being  perpetrated by the traitorous rebels against the innocent  residents of Aden, who are being used as human shields, who are  being forced to bear arms, and who are also being forcibly sent  to death. They urged their misled brothers and sons not to  allow themselves to be taken in by the propaganda of the  rebellious secessionists, and to quickly rejoin the forces of  unity and legitimacy, where they normally belong. By so doing,  they will take advantage of the general amnesty. Moreover, they  will also help end the bloodletting in Yemen and defeat the  schemes that aim to end unity and destroy the homeland.    The Presidential Council chairman then spoke, welcoming the  brother ulema, men of religion, social figures, and party  leaders of al-Dali' District. He pointed out that the brotherly  meeting came after a tragedy befell the homeland as a result of  the conspiracies and after the agents rebelling against  legitimacy decided to ignite sedition due to their  conspiratorial system, which they have inherited and on which  they have been brought up in return for a handful of desecrated  money. These sides, he said, worked to escalate the military  situation in Abyan, 'Imaran, Dhamar, Aden, and al-Dali' as part  of a hellish plan to disrupt the homeland.    The brother president said: We talked about that plan, which  began after the traitor and secessionist agent, al-Bid, returned  from abroad and after he received the price of secession and the  blood of the sons of the homeland. Traitor al-Bid, he added,  actually began his plan through the resounding speeches he  delivered in al-Dali' District to ignite sedition, whose price  he had received. The brother president said: Al-Bid and his  supporters, like the traitors al-'Attas, Bin-Husaynun, al-Sayli,  and al-Jifri, have deposited the money they received at European  banks. These people have received the price of the Yemeni's  people's blood and ignited sedition in the homeland to disrupt  it. He pointed out that these traitors tried exercising a media  disinformation campaign to win the feelings of the masses, only  for a short time though, because the people discovered their  nature and that of the slogans the traitor al-Bid used to  repeat, like the civilized project, which means to these  traitorous agents destruction, death, secession, and stirring up  sectarian differences in the name of Qahtani, 'Adnani, Zaidite,  Shafi'ite, southerner, northerner, and other sectarian  differences.    The brother president said the traitor al-Bid has been  lying to the people because he is skilled at lying, he is  psychologically ill, he suffers from an inferiority complex, and  he is known for his conspiracies against Qahtan al-Sha'bi,  Faysal 'Abd-al-Latif al-Sha'bi, the diplomats, 'Abd-al-Fattah  Isma'il, 'Ali 'Antar, 'Ali Hadi Sha'i, Salih Muslih, and 'Ali  Nasir Muhammad. If he finds no one against whom he can  conspire, he conspires against himself. The brother president  said: This is not a vilification, but it is the truth. Our  Yemeni people are paying the price in blood and in destruction  for what the terrorist rebels have spread in the homeland.    The brother president also said that during the crisis, he  informed several people in the Districts of al-Dali', Radfan,  and Yafi' that al-Bid would carry out his secessionist plan,  that their sons would become fuel for that plan as they are  fighters, and that al-Bid would be the first to escape. We, he  added, also advised Haytham when he was still defense minister  not to be drawn into the secessionist plan and to support unity,  but, regrettably, he was drawn into that plan in return for  money. These people did not remember the martyrs' of the  revolution and martyr strugglers 'Ali 'Antar, Salih Muslih,  Sha'i' Hadi, 'Abd-al-Fattah Isma'il, and others, who were  staunch advocates of unity.    The brother president added: The traitorous agent  secessionists created sedition in the homeland. We have not  sought to see a single drop of blood shed in Yemen, neither by  those who are supporting unity and legitimacy, nor by those  opposed to them, who, in the final analysis, are our sons. To  avert this, we have attempted dialogue. We have gone to Jordan  and signed a pledge and accord document there to end the crisis  and spare our country all problems. Nonetheless, the rebels  were bent on causing a flare-up in the situation in  implementation of their secessionist plan, which is eventually  targeted against the Hadramaut Governorate.    The brother president went on to say: The al-Dali' residents  have always been at the forefront of strugglers, who upheld the  slogan of unity, because they believe that their pride and honor  are ensured when there is unity. The blood being shed right now  is meant to safeguard unity and legitimacy. And here our people  have lost men and property. Would the result then be  fragmentation? Would the result be the division of the country  into two Yemens just to gratify the desires of a few people who  have received a price for the crisis, infighting, and secession,  and who will eventually flee the homeland to use their money  after having caused fires in the homeland?    The brother president said: We thank the brother residents  of the al-Dali' District. We highly appreciate their  cooperation with the forces of unity and legitimacy. We also  thank the fighters hailing from the al-Dali' District, who are  currently waging an honorable battle in defense of unity, and  who are making sacrifices to safeguard unity, as they made  sacrifices to vindicate the revolution and achieve independence  in the past. All, people and parties, are currently melting in  the crucible of the homeland and forming a broad front in the  face of the traitorous and rebellious secessionists.    The brother president added: Today, we reiterate the call  for the brothers who have been misled into fighting on the side  of falsehood to take advantage of the opportunity granted them  by the general amnesty to rid themselves of the coma they are  suffering due to media deception and propaganda so that they may  rejoin the ranks of the strugglers vindicating unity and  legitimacy, where they actually belong. They should not agree  to become tools of destruction manipulated by the traitors,  agents, and mercenaries, who have sold themselves to the enemies  of unity in return for a handful of filthy money.    The brother president stressed that the military personnel  and civilians who choose to rejoin the ranks of unity and  legitimacy will obtain all their rights, on an equal footing  with their colleagues at all departments. They will be welcomed  and accorded due attention. This would be an honor for them.  Additionally, this would halt the bloodletting and vindicate  their people's will, which has always been in favor of unity,  because it is the epitome of their pride and dignity.    The brother president indicated that a government committee  has been formed to account for the losses in human lives and  property, and to take the necessary measures to rebuild what has  been destroyed due to this sedition caused by the rebels. He  added: We have instructed that all people be dealt with on an  equal footing, regardless of whether they supported the state  and legitimacy or were misled. This is because they all are our  sons.    The brother president affirmed that the traitorous rebels  have conspired against the Yemeni Socialist Party to liquidate  it and marginalize its role. And here, the picture is unfolding  before your very eyes. And now you see the traitor al-Jifri,  and the sultans, whose ouster was sought by the 26 September and  14 October armies and strugglers of the liberation war,  returning to implement a plan to tear the homeland apart. He  added: This will never happen, for the Yemeni people, their  Armed Forces, and their security troops will lie in wait for  these traitors and mercenaries, regardless of the sacrifices  entailed.    Concluding his speech, the brother president said: We  welcome you once again, and clasp your hands as unity-oriented  strugglers. You must do your best to explain the facts and  repulse the traitorous secessionists. As for the future, God  willing, it will bring prosperity to our Yemeni homeland under  the canopy of unity and democracy.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By 'Izzat Daraghmah] </F>   [Excerpt] Jerusalem -- Palestinian leaders and  personalities in the occupied territories have described the  U.S. position on the adoption of a Security Council resolution  condemning the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre on 25 February as a  position "that is biased and dishonest. The United States  cannot be accepted as a sponsor of the negotiating process  because it defends Israel, its positions, and justifications.  The responsibility for this massacre falls on the Israeli  Government and Army, which controls all the Palestinian  territories."    Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, head of the Palestinian negotiating  delegation in Washington, said: The United States cannot be a  sponsor of the conference because this requires honesty and  credibility, and this is what the current U.S. Administration  lacks.    'Urayqat added that delay on the issuing of and voting on a  resolution condemning the massacre has been caused by the  position of the United States, Israel's strategic ally. On the  first day of the massacre, the United States said: "We will see  you at the Security Council if you are insisting that it issue a  resolution on the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre". However, the  United States backed down as a result of Israel's recommendation  and linked the issuance of that resolution with the PLO's  consent to resume the talks.    For her part, Dr. Hanan 'Ashrawi, head of the first  Palestinian juristic organization for monitoring the Palestinian  authority on human rights, considered the U.S. position as an  attempt at blackmail by using the Security Council resolution as  a means to pressure the PLO to return to the talks.    She added: The sign that is more serious than all this is  that, as we are constantly aware, U.S. intervention has always  been in the Israeli interest and against the Arabs in order to  give Israel the opportunity to dictate what it wants and to  protect Israel from the consequences of its actions. Even more  serious than this is that there are real indications of a shift  in U.S. policy regarding Jerusalem. I believe that if the  United States changes the Security Council draft resolution,  whereby that resolution will become ineffective and useless with  respect to Jerusalem, and if it uses the veto, this will be  proof of a grave U.S. challenge to UN resolutions and of a  fundamental shift in respect to Jerusalem. This will greatly  alter the credibility of the United States as a sponsor, because  then it cannot be a neutral sponsor.    'Ashrawi stressed that if the Security Council resolution is  similar to previous ones, there will be no need to issue a new  resolution. She said that the United States itself is in favor  of this sort of approach and attitude.    Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, head of the reformers in the PLO,  said: The Security Council resolution stemming from the criminal  act of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre must contain certain  requirements, most important of which are providing protection  for the Palestinian people and achieving credibility. The  Palestinian people are well aware of this.    For his part, Radwan Abu-'Ayyash, head of the Palestinian  radio and television organization and advisory member of the  Palestinian delegation, said: We believe that the massacre that  took place in Hebron represents a grave and bloody threat to the  safety and security of the Palestinian people in the occupied  territories. This requires international protection and  consideration of the PLO's position calling for the presence of  an international protection able to curb the Jewish settlers and  extremists, because this has become very necessary.

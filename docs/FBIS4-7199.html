			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 28 KYODO -- Newly appointed Labor  Minister Kunio Hatoyama has a prominent family background in  politics.    His great-grandfather Kazuo Hatoyama was a former lower  house  speaker, while his late grandfather Ichiro Hatoyama served as  prime minister and his late father Iichiro was foreign minister.  His elder brother Kunio is a lower house lawmaker who has  served as deputy chief cabinet secretary.    Hatoyama, 45, an independent House of Representatives  legislator, replaces Chikara Sakaguchi of Komeito [Clean  Government Party] as labor minister.    After graduating from Tokyo University, Hatoyama became  secretary to the late former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka. He  won a lower house seat as an independent and later joined the  LDP.    He was noted for crossing party lines to vote against the  LDP  government's abortive first attempt to introduce the consumption  tax.    During the first administration of then Prime Minister  Kiichi  Miyazawa of the LDP from November 1991 to December 1992,  Hatoyama served as education minister and proposed scrapping  examinations prepared by the private firms, on the grounds the  exams encouraged excessive competition among students to go to  higher educational facilities.    He left the LDP in 1992 as the party's then largest faction  led by former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita broke up.    Hatoyama has been elected to the lower chamber six times.</p>

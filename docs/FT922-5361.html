			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / East Jerusalem anniversary leads to party discord ISRAEL'S celebrations of the 25th anniversary of its capture of Arab east Jerusalem turned into a discordant chorus of competing political claims yesterday, as leaders of the ruling Likud party and opposition Labour sought to turn the occasion to advantage in the campaign for the general election on June 23. Both Labour and Likud reiterated the popular pledge first made when Israeli forces took east Jerusalem from Jordan on June 7, 1967. 'Our capital is one Jerusalem, forever,' said Mr Yitzhak Shamir, prime minister. 'Never will it be a capital for a foreign power,' he added, referring to the Arab claim that the city be the capital of a Palestinian state. But the two parties were at loggerheads over the celebrations. Mr Ariel Sharon, housing minister, pledged on a visit to a new Jewish settlement in the Moslem Quarter of the Old City to settle Jews in every Arab district, most of which are virtual no-go areas for Israelis. The settlement policy has been condemned as dangerously provocative by Labour and Mr Teddy Kollek, mayor of Jerusalem. Some 150,000 Arabs still live in the city, making up more than 25 per cent of the population. Israel had barred Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza Strip from entering Jerusalem during the celebrations, which coincided with the anniversary in the Hebrew calendar. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Labour leader and army chief of staff during the Six-Day War of 1967, was kept off the list of speakers at a ceremony attended by all parties for signing a 'Jerusalem covenant' to reiterate Israel's claim to sovereignty over the city. Mr Kollek refused to speak and signed the document under protest, objecting to its right-wing ideological tone. Labour hit back, even so, organising rallies at which Mr Rabin and other former senior generals stressed that it was under their command that Israel had achieved its greatest military triumph. As though to blunt the message, Mr Shamir's government ordered a renewed wave of air strikes on Hizbollah Moslem fundamentalist militia targets in Lebanon yesterday, as a 10-day old onslaught there by Israeli forces continued. One raid was inside territory controlled by Syrian forces.</p>

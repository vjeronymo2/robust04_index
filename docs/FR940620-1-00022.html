			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The term ``qualifying event'' with respect to any covered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employee, is defined by section 601 of ERISA, as amended by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 4980B of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, to mean  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any of the following events which, but for the continuation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coverage, results in a loss of coverage of a qualified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beneficiary: death of the covered employee; termination for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasons other than an employee's misconduct, or reduction of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hours, of the covered employee's employment; divorce or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> legal separation of the covered employee from the employee's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spouse; entitlement of the employee under Medicare (title  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> XVIII of the Act); cessation of a dependent child to meet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the applicable ``dependent child'' requirements of the group  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health plan; or with respect to retirees, a filing by an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employer for protection under Title 11 of the United States  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bankruptcy Code of 1978, as amended, 11 U.S.C. &sect;101 et seq.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1902(a)(10)(F), as added by section 4713 of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OBRA '90, provides States with the option of making medical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assistance available for COBRA premiums, as defined in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 1902(u)(2), for qualified COBRA continuation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beneficiaries (CCBs), as defined in section 1902(u)(1) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Act. Section 1902(u)(1) defines a CCB as an individual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> who meets the following requirements:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;He or she is entitled to elect COBRA continuation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coverage;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;He or she has income that does not exceed 100  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent of the official Federal poverty line applicable to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> family of the size involved;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;He or she has resources which do not exceed twice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the maximum amount of resources that an individual may have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be eligible for benefits under the Supplemental Security  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Income (SSI) program, as determined under section 1613 of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Social Security Act; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The State has determined that the likely savings in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicaid expenditures resulting from enrollment in COBRA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continuation coverage is expected to exceed the cost of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> COBRA premiums.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the cost-effectiveness determination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for CCBs, States must determine that likely Medicaid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expenditures on individuals would be higher (if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individuals were not enrolled in the COBRA plan) than the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost the State would pay in COBRA continuation premiums. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other words, the State must determine that enrolling the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individuals in COBRA continuation coverage results in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> savings in likely Medicaid expenditures that exceed the cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of paying the COBRA premiums. This requires the State to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> make a reasonable decision that the individuals (or family  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> members that would be covered by the COBRA coverage) are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> likely to become eligible for Medicaid during the COBRA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continuation period and that enrollment is expected to save  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> money for the Medicaid program. This decision would include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an assessment of whether the individuals would be likely to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> become Medicaid eligible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In contemplating scenarios under which this cost- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effectiveness could be satisfied, we have identified a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of situations in which individuals would appear  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``likely'' ultimately to generate Medicaid expenditures in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> absence of COBRA continuation coverage, even if they were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not currently Medicaid eligible. This would be true, for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> example, of a COBRA-eligible individual who is HIV positive,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and accordingly is determined ``likely'' to become Medicaid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligible based upon disability, and to incur Medicaid costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that exceed the cost of COBRA premiums. A COBRA eligible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual who is not eligible for Medicaid may have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicaid-eligible family members who would be covered by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> COBRA continuation plan if COBRA premiums were paid by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State. In this case, savings in Medicaid expenditures would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be likely to result from the individual's enrollment even  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> though he or she is not Medicaid eligible, nor expected to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> become Medicaid eligible. Finally, a COBRA-eligible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual may be eligible for Medicaid as ``medically needy''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> upon the satisfaction of some modest ``spend-down''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement. In such a case, it may well be reasonable for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the State to conclude that ``likely'' Medicaid expenditures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would exceed the cost of paying COBRA continuation premiums  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that would have the effect of precluding the individual from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incurring expenses sufficient to make him or her Medicaid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1902(u)(2) defines the term ``COBRA premiums'' as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the applicable premium imposed with respect to COBRA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continuation coverage. Section 1902(u)(3) defines COBRA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continuation coverage as coverage under a group health plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided by an employer with 75 or more employees provided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under title XXII of the Public Health Service Act, section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4980B of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or title VI of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

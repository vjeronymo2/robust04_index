			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Jobless challenge Mr John Prescott, shadow employment secretary, suggested in the Commons yesterday that the accurate total of the unemployed was nearly 5m. The latest official figure says 2.722m are out of work. Mr Michael Forsyth, employment minister, said the unemployed total was measured through the numbers claiming benefit and through a definition approved by the International Labour Organisation. Both were broadly the same. Mr Prescott said the government's labour force survey showed that on top of the total another 2.2m people were looking for work.</p>

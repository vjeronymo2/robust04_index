			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Huang Nien-si (7806 1819 2448): "Ma </F> Yuzhen, Chinese Ambassador to Britain on Sino-British Trade"]    [Text] London 21 Jan (TA KUNG PAO)--Ma Yuzhen, Chinese  ambassador to Britain said here today that Chinese residing in  Britain do not have to worry about their right of abode in Hong  Kong in the future; the Chinese government would certainly  appropriately find a solution to that issue.    While dealing with the right of permanent abode in Hong  Kong,  an issue of concern for Chinese residing in Britain and  Sino-British trade in an interview with reporters here today, Ma  Yuzhen said that on the right of abode in Hong Kong of those  Chinese who have already acquired foreign passports and Chinese  living overseas as well in the second generation, the Chinese  authorities were studying the question according to the Basic  Law; it was believed that the matter would certainly be  appropriately resolved in due time; Chinese friends had no need  to worry about it.    Earlier, some individual responsible person of a Chinese  organization aired his view involving the right of abode in Hong  Kong in the future of former Hong Kong residents now residing in  Britain, and was ready to reflect their anxieties to the Chinese  Embassy in Britain. Regarding this, Ma Yuzhen said: "Chinese  compatriots and friends are welcomed to actively relay their  opinions to the Chinese Embassy; the matter is now under the  study of the Chinese Government. Our compatriots may rest at  ease; at the same time, we hope that our compatriots will guard  against some people sowing discord at this moment."    Ma Yuzhen explained: "On the Hong Kong issue, the British  Government has pursued a plan for Hong Kong residents' right of  abode in Britain, which the Chinese Government is against;  however, the Chinese Government will not oppose or target those  people who have already acquired the right of abode in Britain;  furthermore, convenience will be allowed people in this category  regarding their right of abode in Hong Kong; as to specific  conditions, they are under study at present."    He also talked about the contributions Chinese residing in  Britain make to the British economy and Sino-British trade and  the understanding of the anxieties of Chinese capital in Britain  over the effects of the Hong Kong issue on Sino-British trade.    While reiterating the Chinese Government's view on the  issue,  Ma Yuzhen said that because Britain had adopted a  non-cooperative attitude, effects on other arenas in  Sino-British relations would be inevitable. "Although  subjectively, we do not wish to see such circumstances, there is  nothing we could do about it. The responsibility does not rest  with us; objective conditions and subjective wishes are two  different kettles of fish." Ma Yuzhen said the above was what  he told some British friends of the business circles of the  British Industrial Association.    He criticized Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten's attitude  toward Sino-British trade relations in his appearance at the  hearing of the British Foreign Affairs group yesterday; it was  unwise for Patten to have deliberately linked it to the issue of  China applying for restoral of GATT membership.    At the hearing yesterday, Chris Patten said that he did not  believe that China would resist Sino-British trade because of  the Hong Kong issue on the grounds that China was applying for  the restoration of its GATT membership. "Restoring China's  position in GATT will be helpful to China as well as the whole  international community; should an attitude of obstruction be  adopted, that would be unwise, nor would it be helpful to  Britain," Ma Yuzhen concluded.</p>

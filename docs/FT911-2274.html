			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Arts: Flog it to them - Television The first joke-riddle many of us ever heard was probably asked by our grandmothers: 'Do you know the difference between an elephant and a pillar box?' No Granny. 'Then I shan't send you to post a letter'. For those who work at ACBS (A Certain Building Society) this has now been superseded by another question: do you know the difference between swimming with sharks and swimming with dolphins? No? Then we shan't be doing any more business with your company. ACBS is responsible for the most irksomely pretentious television commercial in living memory; that breathtakingly expensive bit of nonsense (modishly shot in black and white, with the sort of inverted snobbery so characteristic of the advertising business) in which a man with trendy designer stubble and an oh-so-sincere voice (would you trust this poseur as far as you could throw him? nor would I) reads out a letter to his son, full of voguish green sentiments. It is the most portentous claptrap imaginable: 'You have left your home to seek your paradise, to find your truth, to walk softly in the footsteps of older, wiser people, to swim with the sharks and the dolphins ..' 'Flog a mortgage company to a TV audience? Piece of cake old boy; shoot 'em the green and caring line. They'll lap it up ..' Well, perhaps a few credulous teenage greenies will, but they don't have much money to spend on mortgages, and experience as a Gallup Poll interviewer suggests that most ordinary people will not remember which particular company this commercial is supposed to promote. Lacking a memorable jingle, rhyme, or pack-shot to serve as a trade-name mnemonic, a commercial can actually be counter-productive and help increase the sales of your competitors. Research by an American brewer suggested that their commercials with tempting shots of foaming glasses did prompt the drinking of more beer - usually the viewer's favourite brand, whichever that happened to be. The ACBS ad is so preoccupied with looking fashionable that the business of ramming home the brand name is forgotten. Can you name the company? The admen, those chaps in designer stubble, granny glasses and recession chic (suits that don't fit) have two standard responses to this sort of criticism. First 'Say what you like, we've got you talking about our commercial and that was the idea', and secondly 'Whatever you may say, the more advertising a company does on television the more it sells, so it works, you see'. The first argument is specious: over the years we have been induced to talk plenty about Aids and mugging but that does not make us want them. We can be well aware of the existence of something and wholly against it. The second argument is a classic example of the fallacy of the undistributed middle. In primary schools the children with larger feet invariably have the better handwriting, but only a fool concludes that the former causes the latter: those with the larger feet happen to be older. Those that buy the most advertising on television happen to be the bigger companies, but there is no proof that the former causes the latter. Companies have achieved enormous success and even brand leadership without buying any advertising (Babe Ruth chocolate bars in the US, Sainsbury's in Britain). So advertisers who are told by the stubble and granny specs brigade that it doesn't matter if the public makes fun of your commercials, so long as they notice them, might try murmuring to themselves 'You're never alone with a Strand'. This notorious cigarette campaign attracted endless attention yet killed the product stone dead. Everyone noticed it but no one wanted to identify with a brand so favoured by the lonely. Of course it takes all sorts to make a world, different viewers react in different ways, and likes and dislikes among the commercials can arise from little more than prejudice. My current bete noir - 'If yore sat arahnd at 'ome, Make new friends on the tell-er-foam' - no doubt seems like a godsend to some people. There may be saintly viewers who, upon being told for the 17th time that everyone's after Bernard Maffews' crispy crumbly turkey stools (or is it steaks?) do not scream at the television 'Oh no they're not, I'm not'. The likes are just as idiosyncratic. Who would have dreamed that the naughty roller-skating pandas could continue to get laughs for Kit Kat after so many months? Or that the Nazi hero and the squawking Lancaster navigator in Carling's dam-buster spoof would go on and on seeming funny? As for Robbie Coltrane and his granny in the Persil liquid ad, do they seem especially welcome in their own right, or is it because we had all become so fed up with those deadly Nanette Newman commercials? There is, surely, a serious point behind all this. It must be better to be funny and create affection than to be too clever by half and create fury or, equally counter productive, bafflement. On television at present there are a number of motor car campaigns which are either baffling or off-putting or both. Would you really want to buy a car that was so boring it sent you to sleep? That is what Rover's agency seems to imagine: they show a chap taking a baby for a drive and before long both of them are zizzing away. According to Audi's agency theirs is the sort of car bought by people who crash head-on into each other and climb out grinning inanely. Will this persuade you to buy? And how about that other one which, until recently, kept hurtling through the plate glass on the top floor of a factory? 'Built by loonies for suicidal Scandinavians' seemed to be the message. Merely to get noticed is not enough: you can hardly not notice the fact that Cadbury and Ford are both currently using Dave Brubeck's 1961 hit 'Take Five', the first to promote Twirl and the second to promote the Orion, but if you are anything like me that will ensure that you never buy either. Having a reputation for cleverness and wit, as British commercials do, is all very well even if the people who pay the fees of the designer stubble chaps might prefer a reputation for improved sales. For viewers, cleverness and wit is far more entertaining than hard sell, but when it backfires - when you lisp away huskily about swimming with the sharks - and irritate viewers, the entire process has surely been turned on its head.</p>

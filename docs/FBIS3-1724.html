			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Liao Yuan (1675 0626)] </F>   [Text] Nanjing, 22 Feb (XINHUA) -- During his inspection  tour of Jiangsu, Li Tieying, member of the CPC Central Committee  Political Bureau, state councillor, and minister in charge of  the State Economic Restructuring Commission, stated: This year  is crucial for reform. The tasks of reform include fully  implementing the major reform measures enacted by the central  authorities, undertaking careful organizational efforts, and  providing specific guidance in accordance with the "Decision" of  the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, to  ensure smooth implementation of the reforms in question. Reform  should be closely linked to economic construction to promote  sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development.    From 11-20 February, Li Tieying visited enterprises and  rural  areas in Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Yangzhou, and Zhenjiang cities  to assess the progress made by urban and rural areas in carrying  out reforms in economic, cultural, and other fields. Li Tieying  pointed out: The current economic situation and reform status  are excellent, and we are faced with rare opportunities. The  central authorities have enacted or will soon enact a set of  plans to reform structures in the macroeconomic arena and other  fields. Reform has moved into a new stage of full-scale  intensification and overall coordination. The main task of  reform for all localities is to seriously study, thoroughly  understand, and fully implement the "Decision" of the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, as well as  the reform plans developed by the central authorities. This  year, we should tackle key reform tasks, whose scale and scope  are unparalleled, and whose arduousness and complexity we should  fully recognize. All localities should formulate implementation  plans, undertake careful organizational efforts, provide  specific guidance, and improve upon the current favorable  situation in light of their realities. The reform process will  inevitably lead to new problems and circumstances, which we  should study without delay to make timely adjustments and sum up  our experiences in earnest. We should show a pragmatic spirit,  ensure the smooth implementation of various reforms, and further  promote development through reform.    During the tour, Li Tieying invited the leaders of Suzhou,  Wuxi, and Changzhou cities; the persons in charge of the  planning and economic commissions and the economic restructuring  commissions of those cities; and some entrepreneurs to an  informal discussion to solicit their opinions on the "Plan on  Establishing an Experimental Modern Enterprise System."  Participants in the discussion noted: All localities are  seriously studying ways to establish a modern enterprise system,  which was considered the microeconomic basis of the socialist  market economic system, an effective means for combining public  ownership with the market economy, and vitally important for  invigorating large and medium state-owned enterprises and for  establishing a new socialist market economic system. Li Tieying  noted: The proposal for instituting a modern enterprise system  represents a review of our experience over the past 10-plus  years in carrying out actual enterprise reforms and in  conducting theoretical explorations; it points the way for  reforming state- owned enterprises and signals a shift in our  country's enterprise reform toward initiating a new enterprise  system through the readjustment and development of our country's  policy of delegating power and allowing enterprises to retain  profits. Judging from the current situation, we are still in an  experimental stage of establishing a modern enterprise system.  The experiments the State Council plans to carry out in some  100 enterprises constitute explorations for a new enterprise  system, and will provide experience in establishing a modern  enterprise system. For the majority of enterprises, the  prominent issue is to improve quality, strengthen management,  and stress efficiency. They should conscientiously change their  mechanisms in accordance with the "Enterprise Law" and the  "Regulations Governing the Change of Operating Mechanisms in  State-Owned Enterprises." They should also establish a  financial and accounting system that meets the demands of a  market eocnomy in accordance with the "two sets of regulations,"  to create conditions and lay the groundwork for the next stage  of reform.    Li Tieying fully affirmed the achievements scored by the  Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou regions in economic development,  reform, and opening up. He said: The past 10-odd years have  witnessed rapid economic development in Suzhou, Wuxi, and  Changzhou cities, whose total output of goods and services  exceeded 100 billion yuan in 1993, or half the provincial total,  and whose industrial and agricultural output value surpassed 300  billion yuan, or three- fifths of the provincial total. These  achievements were mainly born of reform. People in the three  cities seized opportunities to conduct bold explorations in  deepening reform and opening wider to the outside world, thereby  gaining a wealth of useful experiences; these experiences  deserve to be summed up earnestly. Li Tieying particularly  noted: Although village and town enterprises are the dominant  force in this area, they should further exploit their flexible  mechanisms by deepening reform.    Li Tieying and the leaders of Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou  cities jointly studied ways to increase regional cooperation,  deepen reform, open wider to the outside world, and take  advantage of the cities' proximity to Shanghai to promote  development in the region during the new period. Li Tieying  said: The State Economic Restructuring Commission and the  provincial economic restructuring commission should lend full  support to the region's reform experiments. By focusing on  establishing a modern enterprise system, they should earnestly  coordinate work between higher and lower levels and between  departments in changing government functions, in nurturing  markets, and in carrying out overall supplementary reforms of  the social security, personnel, cadre, and income distribution  systems with a view to creating an even better external  environment for regional cooperation and overall advancement in  development and reform in Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou cities,  and to providing the cities more experiences in promoting  development and stability through reform.</p>

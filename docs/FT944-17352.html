			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets: S Africa golds recover South African gold shares snapped a four-day losing streak as bullion showed early signs of recovery, but a late dip in the metal pulled them off their highs. The gold index finished 29 points better at 2,356 after anearlier rise to 2,377. Industrials shed 9 to 6,261, dealers saying that investors had avoided the market in spite of an early rise on Wall Street; the overall index was 3 better at 5,597. Traders said gold shares had bounced in reaction to recent losses, but had also found renewed support from speculators looking for a commercial rand decline if the financial rand is abolished. De Beers ended 50 cents better at R101 after an initial rise to R102. Anglos shed R1 to R233 and JCI added R1.50 to R106. Gencor rose 15 cents to R14.75. Pick'n Pay continued under pressure, losing 10 cents to R9.50.</p>

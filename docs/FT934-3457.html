			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Gonzalez bid to ease EU strains A clearer European identity in defence policy and a European economic recovery would do much to ease strains in relationships with the US, Spain's premier Felipe Gonzalez said yesterday. Speaking after a White House session with President Bill Clinton on Monday, he identified the Nato summit in Brussels next month and the extra steps to European monetary union due to take effect on January 1 as important markers in this process. 'We are still unsure if co-ordinated policies can lower European interest rates,' he said. 'But lowering them, together with a Gatt agreement, is of most interest to the US because a European economic recovery is in the American interest.' Mr Gonzalez thought Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, had 'exaggerated' last week in warning of the deleterious effects on Nato of a failure to reach a Gatt agreement. He felt the already evident US economic recovery would remove some of the broader US concerns, as would a future European rebound. But he conceded that it was proving difficult to define policies to deal with what he called 'the new world disorder'. On Bosnia, the prime minister thought the US was right in being 'cautious' about committing troops to enforce a settlement. But he noted the growth in public support in Spain, from less than 40 per cent to over 70 per cent, for humanitarian peacekeeping operations there. He took consolation in certain political paradoxes: that the current Italian government might be the weakest in Europe but still had a better chance to institute necessary domestic reforms than any in the past 10 years. Concerning Cuba, he stressed the Spanish preference for ending the economic embargo.</p>

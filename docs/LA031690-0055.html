			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> FRENCH ORCHESTRA AT AMBASSADOR AUDITORIUM  </P> <P> Don't try to tell anyone in the Orchestre National de France, or Lorin Maazel  for that matter, that Beethoven is a greater composer than Saint-Saens. They  might get angry. At least so it would seem if their Wednesday night concert at  Ambassador Auditorium is any indication.  </P> <P> Maazel began with Beethoven's "Fidelio" Overture, in a polite, tidy rendition,  notable more for nimbleness than weighty heroics. He followed with more  Beethoven, the Symphony No. 4. It started promisingly enough, the opening  Adagio taking on a sinister quality with the measured calm of Maazel's pacing  and poised balances in the orchestra.  </P> <P> But thereafter it was as if Maazel and orchestra had switched to automatic  pilot. He made graceful, sometimes cute, always dapper gestures; the orchestra  responded with nonchalant neatness. The outer movements lacked robustness,  moving along at times with a certain elegance, but with little feeling for  their playfulness. The Adagio became a leisurely stroll, a pleasant rehashing  of the notes.  </P> <P> This orchestra plays well; its strings are a unified body in tone and  execution, and the woodwinds have a distinctive, grainy blend. And there were  good moments: some telling rhythmic points in the Minuet, an alertly shaped  trio and beautiful clarinet solos in the Adagio. But these remained just  moments in a musical whole of cool indifference.  </P> <P> It was a different matter altogether with Saint-Saens' "Organ" Symphony. Here,  the orchestra dug in with aggressiveness and fire, the strings in particular  taking on a powerful, brilliant sheen. There were sweeping lyrical lines and  big, rich-toned climaxes.  </P> <P> The ensemble played the Adagio with clear passion, and, in the lurid Finale,  made a brassy, muscular noise, with the help of the guest soloist, Douglas  Major, on the Allen Digital Computer Organ. Instant bravos at the end and a  standing ovation -- but it was still only Saint-Saens. TIMOTHY MANGAN  </P></p>

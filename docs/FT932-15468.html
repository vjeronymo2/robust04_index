			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Nomura urged to participate in GPA issue GPA GROUP'S biggest shareholder, the Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corporation, is urging its financial adviser, Nomura International, to take up part of the company's Dollars 200m (Pounds 131m) convertible preference share issue. Bankers to GPA recently gave the debt-ridden aircraft leasing company until the end of this week to raise Dollars 100m from existing shareholders and new investors, with indications of serious bids for the other Dollars 100m. But international investors have given a less than enthusiastic response to the fund-raising exercise which is the first stage of a broader financial restructuring. Mitsubishi, with 12 per cent of the equity, has indicated that it is willing to subscribe for up to Dollars 50m of the new shares on condition that Nomura does the same. Nomura, which co-ordinated GPA's ill-fated attempt for a public listing last summer, has so far refused Mitsubishi's request. It already holds 1.75m GPA shares, most of which it bought at an average of Dollars 20 a share compared with the Dollars 1 conversion price of the convertible. According to one of the group's bankers, GPA has identified other shareholders and potential new investors which may be willing to subscribe. These include existing shareholders such as the Long Term Credit Bank of Japan and a big US state pension fund. However, so far only the Irish government has commited itself to taking part in GPA's share issue. The Shannon Development Authority, a regional development agency in the west of Ireland where GPA is based, is willing to take up the rights of Aer Lingus, another big shareholder. GPA's other big shareholders, Irish Life and Air Canada, have not committed themselves. Mr Tony Ryan, the group's founder and chairman who has an 8 per cent stake, has told bankers he is unlikely to take up his rights. Some shareholders are concerned that the group has been unable to raise Dollars 752m from the sale of bonds backed by 18 aircraft leases, called ALPS 2. The group originally hoped that the issue would be completed by the end of March.</p>

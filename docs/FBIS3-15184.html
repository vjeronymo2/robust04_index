			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Mikhail Pogorelyy commentary: "Growing Level of Activity </F> To Resolve Bosnian Conflict"]    [Text] In recent days some people have started speaking  with hope and others with apprehension of Russia's increasing  efforts to achieve a Yugoslav settlement. Certain politicians'  voices quiver with irritation and even a sense of grievance at  Moscow's "unilateral" actions which have led to a breakthrough  in the 22-month-old impasse of the Bosnian crisis. They are  less keen to talk about the impotence and fruitlessness of their  own, admittedly, "multilateral" efforts to achieve the same  overall aims by purely strong-arm methods.    Be that as it may, it should be acknowledged tht Russia's  increasingly active involvement in resolving the Yugoslav crisis  and Moscow's increasingly constructive role in this process are  objectively prompting our Western partners to consider, search  for, and make unorthodox moves. Paris, London, and Washington  are reluctant to award the laurels of arbiter of the Balkan's  fate to Russia "without a fight." But Russia is not seeking to  determine the development of events in the expanses of former  Yugoslavia single-handedly. Russia has for a long time now been  persistently urging the Security Council and the major European  powers to find a coordinated, mutually acceptable way of solving  the Bosnian conflict.    From this standpoint, the accord reached in Moscow between  Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and Bosnian Serb leader  Radovan Karadzic on lifting the siege of the airport in Tuzla  and its use for the delivery of humanitarian consignments to the  Muslim population under the supervision of Russian observers is  an excellent example of actual constructive moves. If the Serbs  regard the Russians as historical allies and partners and are  ready to cooperate, if you will, more closely and openly with  us, thank God for that. If the Muslims and Croats of Bosnia are  able to achieve peace on the basis of the agreement signed at  the same time in Washington on creating a federation with the  support of the Americans or others that is a very fine thing.    It is important that the great powers do not succumb to the  temptation of exploiting the situation in Bosnia solely as a  stage for demonstrating their place in world politics and  showing "who's master in the house" rather than actually trying  to resolve the Bosnians' future. For example, the U.S.  Administration and its top officials -- for the time being at  any rate -- are successfully resisting the conservatives'  accusations that they are making concessions to Russia.  President Clinton considers -- and with justification -- that  it is not so important who makes how many initiatives, what  counts is not the arithmetic of propaganda but the effectiveness  of the efforts of all the sides involved in settling the crisis.    Some Western politicians and commentators in the mass media  are discussing whether Russia will damage its relations with the  West to save its Serbian ally? The question is improperly  formulated, and any kind of answer to it will therefore be  innacurate too. Here you clearly see an approach characteristic  of the Cold War era, when the superpowers divided the world up  into spheres of influence and a whole policy, or even whole  countries could be categorized as either "ours" or "bad."    No, the world is not like that today. And there should be no  reversion to the old standards. We should therefore regard as a  good policy not necessarily "ours" but the policy that leads  objectively to general well-being and victory over common  misfortunes. Incidentally, Russia has exhibited such an  approach over the incident involving the planes downed in the  Sarajevo region. It has not been clarified to date whose planes  they were, where they took off from, or who piloted them. But  our country firmly supports the UN-approved stance on the  unacceptability of any side employing aircraft for combat  purposes in the skies above Bosnia. (The aircraft downed by the  Americans, no wreckage of which has yet been seen (!), are  claimed to be Yugoslav-made G-2 Galeb or G-4 Supergaleb light  jet trainers. The former Yugolav People's Army was equipped  with them and they can be used as ground-attack aircraft.    The fact that the first real successes of the peacemaking  efforts of the United Nations and its contingent in former  Yugoslavia and the parallel moves of Moscow and Washington have  also necessarily showed up the worth of people in the Bosnian  leadership and what their true aims are is another matter. Thus  Ejup Ganic, vice president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency,  for example, has stated that the opening of the airport at Tuzla  is "an insult to the United Nations," as it will be carried out  by Russians. That is to say, what is important to Ganic, is it  not, is not a positive result but the actual process of the  struggle for it? He does not want to see Russian soldiers  wearing Blue Berets in his republic, as they, Ganic said in a  BBC interview, will bring "Russia's internal problems" to Bosnia.</p>

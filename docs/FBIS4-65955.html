			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The government has reached agreement on a  national subsidy package linked to the EU [European Union]  settlement. Uninterrupted negotiations lasting 12 hours ended  this morning at about 0500. The government's ministerial group  on the EU also agreed that Finland will hold a referendum on 16  October on joining the EU, that is, before Sweden and Norway.    According to Prime Minister Esko Aho, the main features of  the subsidy package are in line with a proposal drafted by a  group of officials. The costs of the first year of the subsidy  package will be nearly 15 billion markkas, after which they will  then fall. The domestic subsidy for agriculture will be 5.5-6  billion markkas a year.    The government's ministerial group will finalize the  decisions on the subsidy package this morning. After that, the  parliamentary groups of the government parties will decide on  their stand on the solution achieved and the Council of State  will make decisions tomorrow.    During the night, the government also decided on a reduced  value-added tax on foodstuffs. Instead of the planned 22  percent, their tax base will be 17 percent for the next three  years. From the beginning of 1998, the tax will fall to 12  percent. [passage omitted]</p>

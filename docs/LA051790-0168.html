			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAMILY FEUD;  </P> <P> SISTERS OF MERRITT ADAMSON JR., ABOVE, ARE LOCKED IN A BATTLE WITH HIS WIDOW  OVER CONTROL OF THE FAMILY'S VAST FORTUNE. THE CONTEST MAY ULTIMATELY DECIDE  THE FUTURE OF MALIBU.  </P> <P> When Merritt Adamson died of cancer in 1986at the age of 59, he left behind  more than just his one-third share of a $75-million family fortune.  </P> <P> Shortly before he died, the real estate scion signed an agreement making his  two sisters the sole guardians of a once-mighty Malibu land empire and leaving  his widow, Sharon, with little say in the affairs of the Adamson Cos., the  family firm.  </P> <P> Now, Sharon Adamson and her former sisters-in-law are slugging it out in court  for control of the contested third of the family holdings. Barring a  settlement, the case is expected to go to trial this summer. But beyond  settling a feud among wealthy heirs, the outcome may also play a key role in  shaping Malibu's future.  </P> <P> In its rush to install a sewer system in the seaside community, Los Angeles  County has struck a private deal with the sisters, Sylvia R. A. Neville and  Rhoda-May Dallas, to surrender six acres they own near Pepperdine University  for the site of a sewage treatment plant.  </P> <P> In exchange, the county offered to help expedite approval of a 300-room,  $65-million hotel the sisters want to build in Malibu. The hotel, and  Pepperdine's plans to double the size of its campus, depend on the sewer  system.  </P> <P> Suddenly, however, the sewer appears to be less than a sure thing. Malibu  voters are poised to decide June 5 whether the community becomes a city, and  approval is widely expected. They also will pick a five-member City Council  that is likely to be far less enthusiastic than the county has been about  sewers, hotels and development in general.  </P> <P> Last week, a judge struck down an attempt by the county Board of Supervisors to  delay Malibu's actual incorporation date until next March if voters approve  cityhood. The delay had been intended to enable the county to start work on the  sewer before a new local government had the chance to block it.  </P> <P> And despite the county's eagerness to accept from Neville and Dallas the  six-acre parcel that is intended to be the centerpiece of the $43-million sewer  system, more trouble is brewing.  </P> <P> The property has become tangled in the nasty legal battle between Adamson and  her former sisters-in-law. Adamson, who doesn't want the sewer plant built  there, claims a one-third ownership of the six acres and insists that the two  sisters have no right to give it away.  </P> <P> She is said to be sympathetic to about 100 homeowners whose houses are uphill  -- and, they say, downwind -- of the site. They say that if the plant is built  under their noses, it could wreck the resale value of their million-dollar  homes.  </P> <P> "We're pawns caught in a war between major landowners, with the county wanting  to sacrifice us," said Bob Briskin, a member of the Malibu Country Estates  Homeowners Assn. The group has hired well-known public interest attorney  Carlyle Hall Jr., and is threatening a lawsuit to try to block the plant.  </P> <P> Theirs is a cause celebre among anti-sewer, pro-cityhood forces in Malibu who  have long regarded the county's efforts to install sewers as a prelude to  widespread development. For many slow-growth advocates, the Adamson ruckus is  an unexpected bonus.  </P> <P> The squabble over the plant site, however, is only a small part of the legal  war between the heirs.  </P> <P> In her lawsuit against Neville and Dallas, in which she is seeking a third of  the family fortune that some observers say may now have appreciated to $100  million or more, Adamson has asked that the partnership agreement her husband  signed be nullified. She claims that Neville and Dallas exerted undue influence  on her husband to sign, knowing that he was too ill to understand it.  </P> <P> The agreement replaced one drawn up 18 years earlier that had provided that,  upon the death of any of the siblings, his or her heirs would have the right to  sell their one-third share of the Adamson Cos.' assets at full market value.  </P> <P> Under the new arrangement, however, the sisters became sole general partners in  the family firm when their brother died, and Sharon Adamson, as a limited  partner, was left with little say over what she claims should have been her  inheritance. Neville and Dallas, meanwhile, say the agreement gave them the  right to buy out their brother's entire share of the family fortune for  $200,000.  </P> <P> In a countersuit against Adamson, the sisters have asked that the agreement be  enforced and that Adamson accept the $200,000 and relinquish any further  claims.  </P> <P> Although none of the women would agree to be interviewed, friends and former  business associates, as well as court documents, reveal a rift between Merritt  Adamson's widow and his sisters that has become intensely personal.  </P> <P> For example, one of the first things Neville and Dallas did after their  brother's death was to dismiss his son, Grant, from the company job he had held  for seven years. They also quickly moved to exclude Sharon Adamson from  participating in any company decisions, according to court documents.  </P> <P> "There's enough family infighting there to fill several episodes of 'Falcon  Crest,' " said a longtime associate of the women, who spoke on condition that  he not be identified. Close associates say they haven't spoken amicably to each  other in years.  </P> <P> In court documents, Adamson accuses Neville, 68, and Dallas, 73, of being inept  managers who don't even know how to read an annual report.  </P> <P> She says that they've failed to provide an estate plan, and that if either were  to die, the company would have to sell much of its assets at distressed prices  to pay inheritance taxes.  </P> <P> Adamson contends that the sisters have frittered away many millions of dollars  through poor business decisions and by relying on individuals with little or no  expertise in managing the firm's diverse holdings.  </P> <P> For example, she says they erred last year in not accepting $5.17 million from  the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy for 575 acres above the Pepperdine  campus that real estate appraisers had determined could not be developed.  </P> <P> She faults them for taking out an unnecessary $3-million bank loan that she  says was placed in a bank certificate of deposit earning less than the interest  on the loan.  </P> <P> Among the advisers, Adamson is especially critical of George Sheridan, who went  to work for the company in 1984 earning $54,000 a year, and, after marrying  Neville, ended up as a company executive earning $220,000.  </P> <P> The couple's 2 1/2-year marriage ended in divorce in January, several months  after a company lawyer came to Sheridan's office to tell him that his wife  wanted out of the marriage and that she wanted him to clean out his desk.  </P> <P> In court documents filed on their behalf, Neville and Dallas shrug off  Adamson's accusations as those of someone bent on breaking up assets that have  been in the family for nearly a century.  </P> <P> Sources close to the family say privately that Neville, especially, never  approved of her brother's choice of a bride. Adamson, a graduate of Stanford  and the daughter of a naval architect, was married to Merritt Adamson in 1954.  </P> <P> Despite the couple's successful 32-year marriage, friends say, the two sisters  always viewed her as an outsider.  </P> <P> It was their grandfather, Frederick Hastings Rindge, who founded the family  empire in 1892 when he bought 13,300 acres of a former Spanish land grant known  as the Rancho Malibu Topanga Sequit.  </P> <P> His widow, May Knight Rindge, later expanded the domain to 17,000 acres,  stretching west from Topanga Canyon along 25 miles of coastline, and as far as  three miles into the Santa Monica Mountains.  </P> <P> May Rindge spent the early decades of this century protecting what was hers.  She thwarted the Southern Pacific's plans to run a railroad by the ranch. And  she battled for years against the Pacific Coast Highway that she knew would cut  a swath through her property.  </P> <P> Her only daughter, Rhoda Agatha Rindge Adamson, and Rhoda's husband, Merritt  Huntley Adamson Sr., inherited the struggle, and in the 1930s almost got more  than they bargained for. The Depression plunged the family beef ranch into  bankruptcy, prompting trustees to sell large parcels of their land to pay  creditors. Only the family dairy, Adohr Farms (Rhoda spelled backward), kept  the family solvent.  </P> <P> It was a diminished but still substantial empire in 1962 when it passed to the  next generation and came under the control of Merritt Huntley Adamson Jr.,  whose development initiatives transformed Malibu from a mostly private domain  to a mecca for the rich and famous.  </P> <P> During his quarter-century as manager of the remaining Rindge-Adamson empire,  he donated land for the core of a campus to Pepperdine University. He built a  mobile home park, a recreational vehicle park and condominiums.  </P> <P> He sold thousands of acres to the state and federal governments for parkland.  He subdivided big chunks of oceanfront property, on which celebrities and  others built the kind of lavish homes for which Malibu is now famous.  </P> <P> And less than two months before his death in 1986, his company received  long-sought permission from the California Coastal Commission to build Malibu's  first large hotel.  </P> <P> Friends say that toward the end of his life, Merritt Adamson was consumed with  the hotel plan. Despite his illness, he traveled to San Francisco to appear  before the coastal panel the day it was approved. Some say his devotion to the  project accounts for his sisters' determination to pursue it despite community  opposition.  </P> <P> Their desire for the hotel also helps to explain why the Adamson Cos. has for  years led the fight against Malibu cityhood. In granting its approval, the  Coastal Commission stipulated that a Malibu sewer system would have to be  installed before the hotel can open.  </P> <P> But time appears to be running out on the hotel. The company has already  obtained four one-year extensions of its coastal permit, and if ground is not  broken before Malibu's incorporation, company lawyers fear they will have to  start over with the application process.  </P> <P> Only this time, instead of dealing with the county, which has been quick to  encourage development in Malibu, the Adamson Cos. would face a potentially far  more hostile city government.  </P> <P> While opposing cityhood, the company has been a generous campaign contributor  to Los Angeles County supervisors. Between 1981 and 1985, the firm was  Supervisor Pete Schabarum's largest corporate contributor, with $23,750 in cash  plus hunting trips and gifts.  </P> <P> In the last four years, the Adamson Cos. has donated more than $40,000 to the  supervisors, mostly to Schabarum and Supervisors Deane Dana and Mike  Antonovich. They, along with Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, have consistently opposed  cityhood for Malibu.  </P> <P> In their private dealings with the county, Neville and Dallas offered to give  away the land for the sewer plant and said they would try to get Sharon  Adamson's cooperation.  </P> <P> Unable to get Adamson to relinquish her purported interest in the property, the  sisters decided to offer the land to the county anyway, and agreed not to  object if the county found it necessary to acquire the property by  condemnation.  </P> <P> County officials, who acknowledge that they do not have a ready backup site if  their efforts to acquire the parcel hit a snag, have been noncommittal about  using condemnation proceedings.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the supervisors are expected to vote Tuesday to accept the property  as a gift from the Adamson Cos., after having been assured by attorneys for the  firm that Neville and Dallas have the authority to donate it.  </P> <P> Adamson disagrees, contending that the parcel was among about $15 million in  assets shared in common by her husband and his two sisters outside the firm and  that the company has no authority to deal it away.  </P> <P> Her attorney, Hillel Chodos, called the arrangement idiotic.  </P> <P> "In short, (the sisters) want my client to give them her interest in the  property so that they can give it away to the county without, according to  them, receiving so much as a snicker," he said.  </P> <P> Others suggest that the sisters may not have been entirely willing partners in  the deal to give the county the land, noting that the county for a time had  considered putting the sewer plant next to the hotel site.  </P> <P> "With this deal, the county gets some free land, and the sisters get to build a  hotel where the guests don't have to smell (excrement)," said a Malibu Country  Estates resident, who asked not to be named.  </P> <P> County officials deny holding the threat of a sewer plant next to the hotel  over the sisters' heads and insist that they are not swapping favors with the  sisters in the current arrangement.  </P> <P> A copy of the agreement Neville and Dallas submitted to the county indicates,  however, that the offer involved more than altruism.  </P> <P> It states that their giving the land is intended to help "ensure the county's  cooperation in the timely processing of (the company's) grading and foundation  permits" for the hotel, as well as approval of interim sewer treatment  facilities in the event work on the hotel is completed before the county's  sewer system is installed.  </P> <P> Harry Stone, the county's deputy director of public works, said that such an  arrangement was "not unusual," adding that the county "tries to cooperate with  an individual developer like the Adamsons just as it would any homeowner."  </P> <P> Asked about the prospects for building the sewer plant if the dispute over the  property isn't resolved soon, he replied, "Then it may be back to the drawing  board."  </P></p>

			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / A wicked tax on our birthright: The Queen has caved in on tax; at least, Charles' inheritance is safe - for now IT IS a matter of the deepest regret that Her Majesty the Queen has been so unnerved by spurious newspaper opinion polls about the popularity of the monarchy as to agree to pay taxes. It is true that there is no great tradition of the monarch being tax-exempt. This was originally granted to George VI only because his coffers had been depleted by the need to buy out his abdicating brother's British properties, such as Sandringham. The coffers, through astute investment, have been replenished. Still, it is sad to see the monarch so swayed by the results of telephone polls in The Sun: 'You tell us. Should the Queen pay taxes?'. (I know someone who rang up six times, using different voices, to say 'yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes'). It is not as if there was any pressure from the two main political parties. Her Majesty has at least not gone the whole egalitarian hog. Her son will not be liable to pay inheritance tax. When asked by a Labour member, 'Why should all private assets passing from one sovereign to the next be exempt?' John Major spoke of 'the danger of assets of the monarchy being salami-sliced away by capital taxation through generations.' Well said. But why does not Major apply this sound moral principle to the rest of us? Shortly after becoming prime minister, he declared his interest in reforming the wicked system of inheritance taxation and spoke of the need to create a society in which 'wealth cascades down thorough the generations.' So far he has done nothing to further this noble declaration. Estates - other than Her Majesty's - are still liable to taxation at 40 per cent. That is the third, terminal, bite of the Inland Revenue. First our earnings are taxed, at up to 40 per cent. When we retire, the income from our savings - if we have not been robbed of them by inflation and illness - is taxed. And then, through inheritance tax, children are penalised for their parents' providence. Perhaps it is too kind to this administration to say that it has done nothing to buttress the great Tory principle of inheritance. In fact it has acted strenuously to destroy inherited wealth. On Wednesday, the day before Major made his staunch defence of the royal family's rights of inheritance, the Commons gave a third reading to the government's highly redistributive Housing and Urban Development bill. Among other things this bill gives leaseholders in subdivided properties and blocks of flats the right to buy out their landlords compulsorily. Michael Howard, the environment secretary, sees this as a great and electorally beneficial extension of the right to buy. It is also the destruction of the inherited estates of the likes of the Duke of Westminster and Lord Cadogan, and the state interfering in legal contracts freely entered into, on the side of one of the parties. It is a measure of which the utilitarian philosophers would have approved. The aggregate amount of happiness which will be felt by the many expropriating leaseholders will exceed the misery experienced by a few voteless grandees. But that does not make it right. Property rights are at the heart of the capitalist system: ignore them, and you damage the integrity of that system, and leave it morally defenceless against those who really wish it harm. If you cannot find it in your hearts to feel pity for the Duke of Westminster, remember that some of our greatest freeholders are pension funds and charities. One is the Henry Smith charity, set up in 1627 'for the purchasing of lands of inheritance for ever for relief of the poor.' The original trustees acquired the village of Brompton, which we now know as Kensington. The income from the that last year enabled the charity to pay out over Pounds 11m to worthy causes. Why should the affluent leaseholders of Lennox Gardens and Onslow Square be allowed to buy out the charity, if its trustees are against it? I cannot believe that any of those tenants acquired their leases without being aware that, on expiry, the property would revert to the Henry Smith charity. Her Majesty should beware. Who knows when this government might decide to treat her inheritance with as much contempt as it has those of other landowners? Dominic Lawson is editor of The Spectator.</p>

			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / International Company News: NatWest US unit extends rally NATIONAL Westminster Bancorp, the wholly-owned US subidiary of Britain's National Westminster Bank, yesterday said its recovery was continuing thanks to a Dollars 39.4m third-quarter net profit. This compared with a loss of Dollars 65.7m in the third quarter of last year. Over the past couple of years Natwest's US subsidiary has been hit by a number of property loan problems, including its exposure to Mr Donald Trump, the property and casino developer. The bank has implemented sweeping management changes in its US unit. Mr John Tugwell, chairman of Natwest Bancorp, said yesterday he was encouraged by the improving performance and the underlying strength of the bank's core business. He said the introduction of new products had enabled the bank to achieve growth in its net income despite the difficult regional economy and lack of loan demand. Bad debt provisions in the third quarter were Dollars 30.5m, down from Dollars 123.1m a year ago. For the first nine months of 1992 provisions were Dollars 91.5m, down from Dollars 479.7m in the same period of 1991. Net income for the first nine months of 1992 was Dollars 105.5m, a significant turnround from the Dollars 341.7m of losses recorded in the same period last year. Total assets of the US subsidiary at the end of the third quarter were Dollars 22.3bn, up from Dollars 21.6bn a year ago. The total loan book stood at Dollars 14.1bn, down from Dollars 14.6bn a year ago. Deposits were Dollars 13.5bn, up from Dollars 13.1bn. Allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 4.54 per cent, against 4.62 per cent a year ago.</p>

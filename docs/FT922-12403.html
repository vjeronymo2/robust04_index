			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Books: Simenon - Maigret's greatest mystery - A triumphant biography of the world's best-selling detective writer THE MAN WHO WASN'T MAIGRET: A PORTRAIT OF GEORGES SIMENON by Patrick Marnham Bloomsbury Pounds 17.99, 346 pages THE three best-selling writers of fiction of all time are William Shakespeare, Jules Verne, Georges Simenon, claims Patrick Marnham. Of these Simenon has had much the least critical attention but wrote by far the most books: he published 193 novels under his own name and as many pseudonymously. His character Maigret, a rival to Sherlock Holmes as the world's most famous detective, stars in 76 of them; when the commissaire retired, his exploits had been translated into 55 languages. Each 'Maigret' took a fortnight to write, during which Simenon was sustained by two bottles of Bordeaux - 'neither too young nor too old' - a day. Simenon's mother wanted him to be a baker ('Have you ever heard of a poor patissier?') but in 1919, aged 15, he walked into the offices of the Gazette de Liege, demanded a job, became junior newshound and then a scurrilous columnist. Every word he wrote comes out of those years as court reporter, when he drank into the small hours with policemen or criminals, watching the upright burghers of Liege turn into 'cheats' and thieves in the aftermath of war. Decades, record sales and millions of dollars later, he remained a chronicler of les petites gens. Simenon was not Maigret, but, as this triumphant biography shows, no one else could have created Maigret's distinctive underworld or his understanding of the criminal mind (both policeman and criminal, he used to say, once stole sweets from the same sweet shop). No other serious writer stayed so in touch with his background that he kept to a vocabulary of 2,000 words so that everyone could enjoy his work, yet was lauded by writers from TS Eliot to Andre Gide, who called him the greatest novelist of the century. Marnham's skill is to pull together the personal and the cultural context of the Maigret milieu, and thus the different sides of Simenon the man. His hero is at once the drinking, womanising journalist who turned the fait divers, the brief news item, into a chain of thrillers, and the fevered genius whose small-time tales are modern equivalents of Balzac's and Flaubert's novels of bourgeois 19th century life. His life story is stupendous. Born in Liege to a father he adored and a mother he loathed, he changed from school swot into delinquent during the First World War, when he saw the corruption of occupation. He formed an arty clique called la caque (the herring barrel, a reference to its tightly packed meetings), whose members admired Expressionism, hung out with prostitutes and drug-dealers, and were obsessed with the symbol of the hanged man. One of them hanged himself from a church door  - the story of Le Pendu de St Pholien; others were later convicted for murder. Simenon broke away to Paris, stalked the cheap hotels and hookers by the Gare du Nord, but impressed Colette with a short story. Editors flocked; Simenon's output grew; in 1928 alone he published 44 pulp novels. He was rich, gave wild parties, married but continued to prefer prostitutes, had an affair with Josephine Baker and one with his wife's maid, Boule, which outlasted the marriage. When Monsieur and Madame Simenon travelled around France and the Netherlands by boat, Boule came too; they slept in a cabin and she, in a tent on the beach, was summoned by trumpet each morning. On one such trip, in 1929, Simenon decamped to a cafe and in a haze of schnapps 'began to see the powerful and imposing bulk of a gentleman emerging, who . . . would make an acceptable detective-inspector'. The large, grumpy, imperturbable, watchful commissaire recalled Simenon's father, who used secretly to support him against his mother. But Maigret's insight into criminal motivation, his refusal to pass moral judgments, were Simenon's own: 'I was born in the dark and the rain, and I got away. The crimes I write about are the crimes I would have committed if I had not got away'. Simenon is compelling because he shows how close the deranged mind is to the ordinary mind; he puts characters in positions which push them to the limits of experience and shows what happens to them at the ends of their tether. He wrote, he said, to rid himself of the ghosts of his imagination, but the personal cost was enormous. His blackest books were driven by hatred of his second wife, Denise, when she announced he no longer attracted her. 'Fais vite,' she would say when he insisted; she accompanied him to brothels, tormented and fought him, and spent years in an asylum while Simenon contented himself with maids ('On passe toutes a la casserole?' - do we all get laid? - asked a new one). His daughter, Marie-Jo, had a breakdown which Simenon could not resist turning into fiction in La Disparition d'Odile; its heroine attempts suicide. A few years later Marie-Jo made a final phone call to her father and shot herself through the heart. Asked what made a novelist, Simenon replied 'a man who does not like his mother, or who never received mother-love'. His novel Le Chat is a pitiless account of his mother and her second husband; they married for money but were convinced each would poison the other, and kept food in separate locked larders in the kitchen. Was he subconsciously trying to please her? Before she died, he produced four to five books a year; shortly afterwards, he abandoned fiction writing completely. In its attempt to pinpoint the key moments and motives of fictional creation, this is a model of literary biography. Like Simenon, Marnham is non-judgmental, entertaining, compact; a quick detail encapsulates a trip across France here, a novel's topography there. From pungent French countryside to gloomy Channel port, Maigret inhabits a precisely delineated imaginative landscape; Marnham explains with glee and sensitivity its origins.</p>

			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / International Company News: Sun Micro earns more as margins improve Sun Microsystems, the US computer workstation manufacturer, has taken the unusual step of releasing its earnings and sales figures for the third fiscal quarter before issuing a full financial report. The move follows a sharp drop in Sun's share price earlier in the week after the company warned that third-quarter revenues would be below analyst's expectations. Sun shares rose Dollars 3 1/4 to close at Dollars 25 3/8 in New York yesterday. Sun's net income for the third quarter, ended March, was Dollars 57.5m, or 60 cents a share, compared with Dollars 51.7m, or 47 cents, in the same period last year. Revenues for the quarter were Dollars 1.19bn, up 5 per cent from Dollars 1.14bn in last year's third quarter. Before last week's announcement, when the company said US sales growth had been held back by anticipation of new workstation products, analysts had been predicting earnings of around 64 cents a share. After the warning, projected earnings dropped sharply to around 52 cents a share. However, in a statement issued after the market closed on Wednesday, Sun said sales of its low-end desktop workstations had been most severely affected by the product transition problem. But with sales of higher performance workstations and servers representing a larger than usual proportion of Sun's sales in the third quarter, gross profit margins increased to 42.8 per cent of revenues, the highest level in the last six quarters, the company said. The increase in gross margins runs against industry trends, but is expected to be temporary as sales of Sun's new low-cost workstations take off. The new products, introduced last week, will 'shatter the workstation price model', Sun claims. Sun introduced mid-range and high performance workstations and slashed the price of its low-end model to less than Dollars 3,000.</p>

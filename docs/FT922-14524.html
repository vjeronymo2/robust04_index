			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Election 1992: Major warns of constitutional 'danger' AN IMPASSIONED call to Britain to wake up to the 'sleeping' constitutional issues to be decided in the election came yesterday from Mr John Major. As the campaign entered its final few days, Mr Major strongly attacked the potentially disastrous consequences of a Labour government. He warned that if people did not understand what was at stake 'we could take the sword of socialism and fall on it, and if we did, our country would fall with it'. In contrast to his apocalyptic tones on the constitutional issue, Mr Major highlighted the 'golden prospects' for the economy under the Tories, and the achievements of the 1980s. He said the day after a Tory victory, industry would 'breathe a sigh of relief that the threat of socialism is gone' and begin investing again. The style of the Tory rally at London's Wembley conference centre, using a Pounds 500,000 circular set that seated about 1,000 people, was in deliberate contrast to Labour's extravaganza in Sheffield last week. Mr Major suggested the rival rally was somewhat 'unBritish' in its regimentation. Instead the format was that used for similar occasions around the country during the campaign. The main difference was that there were sporting and showbusiness celebrities sprinkled about the audience. The main thrust of Mr Major's speech was that people should realise the threat from the proposals for devolution or separation for Scotland put forward by the other parties. He said: 'If I could summon up all the authority of the office I now hold, through the ages, I would put it into this single warning. The United Kingdom is in danger. Wake up now before it is too late. 'Consider the outcome - the walls of this United Kingdom that appear so strong, undermined from within.' In an implicit appeal to former Tory voters inclined to support the Liberal Democrats, he spoke of the risk that people were treating Thursday's poll as a by-election and wanted to register a protest vote without really recognising that the government elected as a result would actually take office. He also highlighted two other threats to the UK constitution: the opposition parties' attitude to the European Community, and proportional representation. 'The Lib-Lab left would not speak for Britain in Brussels, they would act for Brussels in Britain,' he said. Again linking Labour and the Liberal Democrats, he accused them both of toying with the constitution almost casually for political advantage. Following Mr Kinnock's denunciation last week of the 'sin' of parents facing the choice of having to pay or to wait for an operation on their child, Mr Major vigorously insisted that it was right for family members to want to take care of each other.</p>

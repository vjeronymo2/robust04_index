			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Industry gas costs rise by 4.2% FUEL costs for large industrial gas users have risen 4.2 per cent in the past year, in spite of British Gas cutting prices to domestic customers. The increase was the second highest recorded in a survey of international gas prices by National Utility Services (NUS), the consultancy. British Gas has raised the price for companies receiving an interruptible service, meaning they can be cut off at short notice - a service for which they have traditionally paid very low prices. Mr Andrew Johns, director of NUS, said: 'Any UK manufacturing company on an interruptible contract would not be at a competitive advantage compared with its competitors in the countries we surveyed. In fact it would be at a major disadvantage.' The UK ranks sixth out of nine countries when comparing the price charged to business users. But NUS stressed it is inthe bulk-volume, low-pricesector of the industrial market - which has not been penetrated by rivals to British Gas - that prices are rising most rapidly. By comparison German industrial users have seen their gas costs fall by 22 per cent over the past year. The UK was beaten by Belgium, which raised gas prices by 5 per cent last year. Sweden is the most expensive country in gas costs to big users. Mr Ian Powe, chairman of the Gas Consumers Council, who warned on Monday that big users would face substantial price rises, said the survey 'tends to confirm the view that some sectors of the industrial market are seeing no benefit from competition'. Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive of British Gas, yesterday said in a speech marking the sixth anniversary of the company's privatisation that domestic prices for gas had fallen by more than 20 per cent in real terms since 1986. At the same time, contract prices (to non-interruptible industrial users) dropped 25 per cent in real terms. Mr Peter Rost, chairman of the Major Energy Users' Council, said there was increasing concern among his members that interruptible gas will become less available and rise in price.</p>

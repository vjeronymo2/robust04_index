			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Lighting Rod" column: "Will the Military Cause </F> Trouble Again?"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] The cabinet recently decided  that from now on, every purchase of weapons for the armed forces  will be made through "barter trade." In other words, we will  trade our products, mostly agricultural goods, for weapons.  Formerly, the armed forces were allowed to make purchases of  weapons, planes, and military hardware through the Defense  Ministry and government. [passage omitted]    As feedback from the military top brass, the commanders of  the three armed forces voiced their discontent over this new  policy during a meeting chaired by Supreme Commander Air Chief  Marshal Woranat Aphichari. They said that the barter of crops  for weapons will be a very complicated and time consuming  process and the military have no expertise in trade. They also  fear that the weapons or aircraft they receive from bartering  with agricultural products will be costly and inapplicable to  their requirements.    In short, the armed forces feel that they are being pressed  by the government. Frankly speaking, if the military top brass  or professional soldiers, who have so far been fairly quiet,  react against the policy, some will accuse them of trying to  rock the boat again. A few might think that politicians are  creating conditions for certain objectives. Some even claim that  this barter trade policy will also be applied to other big  projects such as the elevated electric train system.    It is a fact that the armed forces need weapons and war  equipment for national defense. However, they must also take  the country's financial position into their consideration. They  cannot go out and choose whatever they want as in the past. All  military equipment is expensive. So they must make sure that  the people's tax money is spent wisely.    I believe that leaders of the military units are "career  soldiers." Their reaction, however, in connection with the arms  barter policy does not look good at all. The fact is that they  do not understand some details of the policy.    The government should be blamed for failing to clearly  explain the policy to all concerned. This is Prime Minister  Chuan Likphai's style, who always leaves something for others in  the ministries concerned to tackle. Prime Minister Chuan should  have clarified the new policy for everyone from the beginning.  However, he passed the ball to Defense Minister General Wichit  Sukmak. He is good at making all sorts of comments or criticisms  against other people. Ironically, he said very little about  this policy. It is possible that he himself does not quite  understand it.    As a matter of fact, there is nothing difficult about this  policy. For example, when a branch of service wants to buy  weapons from a foreign country, it must first inform the  government. The government will then review trade between  Thailand and the country from which they wish to buy the weapons  before holding negotiations to see if the country wants any  agricultural products from us. We may even bargain to have them  buy our crops. The point is that we get their weapons and at the  same time sell them our goods.    However, it should not be implied that this barter policy  will be used with small purchases worth two or three million  baht.    The government failed to spell out all the details of the  policy, while the military is frustrated in its attempt to get  things clearly explained and understood. And reporters are  accused of presenting inaccurate reports as if the military top  brass and people in government circles could do no wrong.</p>

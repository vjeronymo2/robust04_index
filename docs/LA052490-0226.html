			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DITCH DAY AT CALTECH SEES HOW STUDENTS 'STACK' UP  </P> <P> Strange forces took over the sedate, tree-lined campus of Caltech on Monday.  </P> <P> Near the cafeteria, students strapped a TV reporter for Channel 7 upside down  in a tree and doused her with cold water.  </P> <P> At the Winnett Student Center, a poster trumpeted "Gandalf for President."  </P> <P> And across the quad marched 21-year-old physics major Larry Canino, swathed  from head to toe in white rubber and waving what looked like a butterfly net.  </P> <P> "I'm in bio-quarantine," Canino announced blithely. "We lost our thermonuclear  boosters and we're trying to get them working again. It involves a lot of  electronics."  </P> <P> Canino and his team had until 5 p.m., at which time Ditch Day 1990 formally  ended and California Institute of Technology in Pasadena reverted to its quiet  business of imparting one of the finest science educations in the United  States.  </P> <P> Until then, teams of underclassmen, who form spontaneously, would run  frantically around campus searching for clues, solve mind-bending feats in math  and physics and generally comport themselves like fools.  </P> <P> The object: to solve the cerebral and brute-force puzzles laid out by scheming  seniors and gain access to their combination-locked dorm rooms, where caches of  goodies and drinks lay hidden.  </P> <P> Ditch Day is a sort of scientific scavenger hunt for brainy kids that pits  underclassmen -- called "frosh" and "wimps" -- against seniors who have spent a  good part of the school year dreaming up their fiendish plots.  </P> <P> The puzzles, called stacks, take their name from the piles of furniture that  seniors once stacked against their dorm doors in a less sophisticated era to  keep "wimps" out.  </P> <P> Today, the stacks have evolved into ever-more sophisticated tests of brain and  brawn. They can be brute-force stacks, which must be shattered with power  drills, hammers and sweat; finesse stacks, which involve scientific aptitude,  or a combination of both.  </P> <P> Students agree ahead of time to pay for any damage incurred, which has been  known to run into thousands of dollars. That taken care of, school officials  wax enthusiastic about Ditch Day, saying it is intellectually stimulating as  well as a lowbrow way to let off steam. There is no judging or formal  declaration of winners.  </P> <P> "Concrete is a common theme," explained Bob Finn, a Caltech spokesman. "A lot  of the stacks also involve humiliation."  </P> <P> Such as serenading passers-by, for instance, which is what 21-year-old  mechanical engineering major Ben Masek and 19-year-old aeronautics major Hyon  Lew had to do for a stack that simulated a ride along a New York subway.  </P> <P> With a boom box blasting, the two belted out a raucous rendition of "New  Sensation" by the band INXS, with Lew twirling on crutches as the result of a  torn ligament and Masek wielding a tennis racket like Jimi Hendrix on guitar.  </P> <P> While they rocked, another group scrolled on a bank of computers in the Page  House dorms as they labored over a demonic stack that mixed cerebral games with  aerobic ones.  </P> <P> For starters, the group bored with power drills to find three computer chips  buried inside 3x5 blocks of concrete. Then they had to apply their computer  skills to simulate a circuit board whose workings would yield up the  combination to the senior's door lock.  </P> <P> At 11 a.m., dusty from concrete powder and sticky from cans of Cheese Whiz  hidden in the concrete that had exploded all over them when pierced by the  power drill, the frosh were already plotting their revenge.  </P> <P> "I've got $300 we can spend on manure," mused Kevin Park, a 19-year-old  aeronautics major.  </P> <P> Mindful of all the publicity that has come to accompany Ditch Day -- TV, radio  and newspaper reporters descend on the campus as avidly as if covering an  earthquake -- some cynical seniors have even incorporated media tasks, such as  talking a TV reporter into being tied to a tree, into their stacks.  </P> <P> The ignominious drenching wasn't originally part of the stack though. It  occurred when some underclassmen mistook the bound reporter for a senior and  decided to have a little fun. (Traditionally, seniors are trussed up in trees  if found lurking on campus after 8 a.m. on Ditch Day.)  </P> <P> Jimmy Hu, a 19-year-old computer science major whose stack involved a scavenger  hunt to Newport Beach and computer logic games, also had a media-related task  to perform.  </P> <P> "We're supposed to get on Channel 4 news at 4 p.m.," he muttered, glancing at  his watch with little hope as the minutes inched past 3. But things didn't end  there. "We're also supposed to test-drive a new Ferrari."  </P> <P> Staff and students alike enjoy reminiscing about the most memorable stacks ever  concocted at Caltech, where the average student has scored in the top 1% in  math ability and the top 3% in verbal ability on national tests.  </P> <P> One senior left a one-page physics problem taped to his unlocked door. While  honor required that the students solve it before entering to claim their  reward, the problem proved beyond their abilities. In desperation, they took it  to Prof. Richard P. Feynman, since deceased, but not even the Nobel laureate in  physics was able to solve the problem.  </P> <P> For sheer elegance and simplicity, Caltech spokesman Robert Finn recalls the  case of the senior who left a computer outside his locked door but no  instructions.  </P> <P> Figuring they had only to find the right command and the computer would spit  out the lock combination, underclassman spent all day vainly trying everything  from "Open Sesame" to "Please Open Door."  </P> <P> It turned out that the computer was programmed so that if anyone left it alone  for 10 minutes it would have automatically opened the door, Finn said.  </P> <P> Then there are counterstacks, also known as wimp revenge.  </P> <P> One year, dissatisfied with the reward they found after laboring all day on a  bedeviling stack, the wimps took apart the senior's Porsche and reassembled it  in his dorm room, with the motor running.  </P> <P> Another year, a senior returned to his dorm and found a huge water balloon,  filled, with no drain valve. A third was greeted by his furniture, which had  been bolted -- to the ceiling.  </P> <P> This year, a group of frosh hummed like a swarm of irritated bumblebees when  they discovered only soda pop, several apples and a bag of Oreo cookies after  solving a stack called "Crime and Punishment."  </P> <P> "We had to commit a bunch of crimes, like hot-wiring a golf cart and parking it  in a professor's spot, and the bribe was really weak," complained Jack Prater,  a 20-year-old physics and astronomy major.  </P> <P> "After crime we had punishments," added Chris Campo, a 20-year-old planetary  science major. "We had to put our hands in really hot water and shock  ourselves."  </P> <P> So the weary students decided to dish up a little punishment of their own. They  hoisted the senior's moped halfway up the three-story Firestone Flight Sciences  Laboratory and lashed it to the outside wall with ropes, where it dangled for  most of the afternoon, not even swaying in the breeze.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 14, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE;  </P> <P> OPENING DOORS TO HOUSING  </P> <P> With 8,000 to 10,000 people homeless in Orange County -- half of them children  -- six new apartment units may not do much to meet the need for housing. But to  the families involved, they represent a fresh chance to get on surer economic  footing in the face of housing costs that are out of sight for many. For that  reason, HomeAid, a year-old, nonprofit program sponsored by the Building  Industry Assn., is something to be celebrated and praised.  </P> <P> The BIA, a trade association best known for its strong pro-growth stance on  development, announced a year ago it would fund a $1-million effort to help the  homeless. HomeAid subsequently renovated shelters for the homeless or abused  women in Garden Grove, Midway City, San Clemente and Fullerton. Soon, it will  open its first newly constructed facility, a $350,000, six-unit complex in El  Modena. All told, HomeAid says it has added 114 beds to the county's low-cost  housing stock. The HomeAid projects provide transitional living quarters for  people who need help temporarily while they save enough money to get apartments  of their own.  </P> <P> But the need is much greater. The county is short by 4,500 transitional units  alone, and there's an even greater need for permanent low-cost housing for  people to move into once they are self-sufficient.  </P> <P> While what it has done so far is praiseworthy, Orange County's building  industry could do more. It's in a unique position to be able to put together  public/private partnerships to provide low-cost housing, such as single-room  occupancy hotels or inexpensive apartments, for those on the lower end of the  economic scale.  </P> <P> Thousands of people in Orange County have lost their homes through illness, job  loss, divorce or other setbacks. HomeAid represents the first major effort by  private industry to help solve the homeless problem in Orange County. It is a  model of commitment worth expanding and following.  </P></p>

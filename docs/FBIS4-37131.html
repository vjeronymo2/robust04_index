For his part, brother Lt. Gen. 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih  addressed  the officers, NCO's, and enlisted personnel of the al-Yarmuk  Forces, hailing the heroic feats forged by our valiant Armed  Forces in the battle to vindicate the people's wishes of  safeguarding unity and democracy.

He added: But, thanks to God's will, the  steadfastness of our people and their rallying around their  Armed Forces, these criminal schemes targeting the homeland and  its unity have been resisted. He noted the rebellious gang's  criminal practices against our people in the valiant city of  Aden, where various forms of torture and oppression are being  perpetrated against citizens. Children and women are being  forcibly extricated from their houses and made to bear arms  [words indistinct] innocent citizens are being sent to the war  fronts and used as human shields.

He also mentioned the various  cease-fire gestures it made toward the rebels to halt Yemeni  bloodshed, saying that five cease-fire initiatives were made.  Nonetheless, the rebels violated the cease-fire every time, and  continued their attacks against our Armed Forces, thus violating  and disregarding the UN Security Council resolution in defiance  of the wishes of the Yemeni people and the international  community, as well.    President Salih reiterated that, by so doing, the criminal  rebels seek to internationalize the Yemeni crisis, which is a  domestic Yemeni affair. He added that the current fighting is a  battle raging between the entire Yemeni people and a misled and  isolated minority rebelling against constitutional legitimacy  and the Yemeni people's will, which was expressed when the  Republic of Yemen was proclaimed on 22 May 1990, when a public  referendum endorsed the Constitution, and also when free and  direct parliamentary elections were held on 27 April 1993.    The brother president added: Yemeni unity is embedded within  the consciences of all Yemeni people. It is our fate and  destiny, and our way to achieve a prosperous (?independence).  Unity was achieved through a peaceful and democratic dialogue  that went on for many long years. It was not achieved by force.  It is the embodiment of the will of all Yemenis throughout the  homeland. Our people have waged protracted struggles, and made  dear and great sacrifices to achieve their unity on 22 May. He  affirmed that there can be no going back on unity, and that  fragmentation, regardless of any form or shape it might take,  has become a thing of the past. Our people's struggle for unity  has been baptized with blood and dear sacrifices. They will not  agree to relive the tragedies, calamities, and nightmares of  fragmentation once again. The close- knit Yemeni people have  been brought together. The river of unity has overflown,  producing abundance, affection, and prosperity for all sons of  the Yemeni homeland. Those opposed to unity and the will of the  people must flee this homeland, which will not accept within its  ranks and under its skies any people other than unity-  orientated people, who have faith in God, the homeland, the  revolution, and unity; who support their people and homeland;  who are loyal to their causes; and who reject all temptations  that seek to undermine the homeland, its unity, its gains, and  its accomplishments.    The brother leader president concluded by invoking God's  mercy on the souls of the righteous martyrs of our people and  their valiant Armed Forces, who have shed their blood to  vindicate the homeland and allow the banners of unity to flutter  in the skies of the entire Yemeni homeland. He indicated that  their dear sacrifices will allow our people to build a more  prosperous future for the homeland under the banners of unity  and democracy.</p>

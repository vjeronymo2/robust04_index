			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / UK Company News: BAA steps up hotel divestment BAA yesterday moved a step further towards divesting itself of its hotel interests when it granted Forte a 50-year lease to manage its Gatwick Sterling hotel. The British airports group has already sold hotels in Gent and Amsterdam and wants to award management contracts over its two remaining hotels - the Heathrow Sterling and the Harlequin at Stansted. BAA said the 474-room Gatwick hotel, linked to the airport's north terminal, will be known as the Forte Crest, Gatwick. Its 134 staff will continue to be employed by Forte. Forte is not thought to be interested in taking over the remaining two hotels.</p>

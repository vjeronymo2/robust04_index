			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Shell wanted News of a potential disposal helped Shell Transport ahead of first-quarter figures due tomorrow. Analysts were enthusiastic at the announcement that the group was hoping to sell most of its metals assets to Gencor, of South Africa, and the shares ticked up sharply shortly before the close to gain a net 10 at 581p. Hoare Govett was a keen buyer, arguing that as with BP the first-quarter figures would beat most expectations. The house added that the company was well exposed to cyclical recovery through its chemicals side and should receive benefits from currency shifts. Meanwhile, Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull said the sale could 'raise in excess of Dollars 1bn' and prompt a turnround of about Pounds 140m in taxed profits. Analyst Mr John Toalster said: 'This is a major development and shows the company is being more responsive to shareholders' needs.' ICI shed 21 to 1263p as the UK view of today's rights issue pricing for ICI's biosciences arm, Zeneca, took precedence over the more optimistic US stance. ICI's advisers were said to be testing a range of 550p to 650p for Zeneca's Pounds 1.3bn cash call. Glaxo Holdings rebounded from a small early loss to close 21 better at 634p in a flat market following a meeting between pharmaceutical analysts and the company's new management. NatWest Securities was a strong buyer. Fisons was 2 lower at 172p following a downgrade by SGST, which decided its view of the group's scientific instruments business was too optimistic. The house cut its 1993 profits forecast by Pounds 10m to Pounds 130m and its 1994 estimate to Pounds 150m from Pounds 170m. Insurer General Accident rose 18 to 591p after the company announced first-quarter profits well above most analysts' expectations. The company made Pounds 41.9m, against a loss of Pounds 29m a year earlier. Among engineering stocks, the late news that VSEL had won the contract to build the Royal Navy's new LPH helicopter carrier took the market by surprise. It led to a hectic bout of trading and caused a backwardation  - a situation in which the bid and the offer price are temporarily reversed. By the close the shares had jumped 35 to 725p. Monday's suspension of dealings in Arthur Lee and Carclo pending an announcement was lifted after confirmation that the latter was to make an agreed bid for the former. Lee forged ahead 16 to 158p and Carclo gave up 13 at 210p. William Cook moved in sympathy with Lee, adding 12 at 174p. A Pounds 22.5m rights issue from motor components and tyre manufacturer Avon Rubber caused the shares to drop 31 to 501p as the company unveiled a 22.2 per cent increase in interim profits. GKN shed 5 to 452p, with SG Warburg said to have downgraded profits expectations, and NatWest Securities negative on the motor sector as a whole. The fading bid talk around United Biscuits turned investor attentions back to more fundamental considerations in the sector and Cadbury Schweppes gained 6 at 449p and Tate &amp; Lyle added 6 at 388p. UB lost 9 to 425p. A big buyer in Iceland Frozen Foods helped the shares climb 15 to 683p. Profit-taking continued in Ratners, the shares declining 5 to 35p with 18m traded. RMC Group jumped 15 to 700p with SGST positive and Cazenove, its joint broker, said to have upgraded. Shares in office equipment distributor Erskine House leapt 54 to 89p after the announcement of an agreed takeover bid from Alco Standard Corporation, of the US, for Pounds 67.4m. Eurocopy firmed 4 in sympathy. Recent speculation that Inchcape had its eye on Gestetner, the office and photographic equipment distributor, was confirmed by news that it was taking a 15.3 per cent stake in the latter. Gestetner shares closed 7 ahead at 130p while those of Inchcape fell 8 to 583p on the news. Media conglomerate Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, receded 7 to 436p as Hoare Govett reiterated its view that the stock was fully valued and shareholders should switch into Reed International, up 9 at 658p.</p>

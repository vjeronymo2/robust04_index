			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [John Palmer report: "EU Governments Could Lose Power To </F> Veto Integration"]    [Text] Brussels -- A senior European commissioner has  warned that the inclusion of northern and East Europe countries  in the European Union [EU] may have to be followed by limits on  national powers to veto further integration.    Joao de Deus Pinheiro, the commissioner for information and  communications, said yesterday that as well as admitting four  EFTA [European Free Trade Association] states, the Union should  offer part membership to countries in East Europe.    Mr Pinheiro, a former Portuguese foreign minister, was  speaking as talks to admit Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden  approach a climax this weekend. He said in Brussels that the  inevitable opening up of the Union would require far-reaching  changes to the Maastricht Treaty.    He insisted that as the Union expanded, there would be  pressure to remove the power of individual governments to veto a  majority of states moving to closer integration.    The Commission has in effect fired the first shot in what  promises to be a controversial debate about how far, and how  fast, the EU should move towards federal-style political union  when the Maastricht Treaty is revised in two years' time.    "With enlargement about to happen, it is essential that we  now begin the debate about institutional change," Mr Pinheiro  said. "There are precedents for allowing some countries to move  ahead while others stay behind."    He added that excluding defence from the Union in the  Maastricht Treaty had been "a great mistake, which will probably  be rectified in 1996."    His remarks will alert those in the British Government who  want to ensure that constitutional changes continue to be  subject to national veto.    But Britain is aware that if it opposes a system under which  countries are allowed to opt out of specific new EU commitments,  others will point out that this was precisely what John Major  won for Britain in respect of social policy at Maastricht.    "The attitude to European Union membership appears to have  changed recently in some of the EFTA candidate countries because  of what may be called the Zhirinovskiy factor" -- the rise of  Russian nationalism -- Mr Pinheiro said. "We may soon have no  option but to offer countries such as Poland, Hungary and the  Czech Republic membership of at least two of the three pillars  of the EU."    He said that while the economic problems of the East  European  countries made complete integration in the EU unlikely in the  short term, they should be allowed to take part in decisions  affecting foreign, security and eventually defence policy as  well as justice, immigration and the interior.    Under the Maastricht Treaty these, unlike other issues, are  matters for joint decision by member states.    At the end of talks in Brussels yesterday, all but a handful  of issues dividing the EU and the four EFTA countries had been  resolved. Problems remain in agriculture, transit rights for  lorries through the Alps and (with Norway) fishing rights.    "It is touch and go whether an agreement will be reached in  time for the European Parliament to approve enlarging the  European Union from 12 to 16 member states this summer," one EU  diplomat said yesterday.    If final European Parliament ratification of the enlargement  agreements is delayed until the autumn, the four new members may  not be able to join by the agreed deadline of January 1995.    But Austria, Finland and Sweden seem certain to join by July  next year, although the outcome of any referendum in Norway is  still in doubt.    The three Nordic governments will meet in Helsinki on Friday  [25 February] to plan tactics for what promises to be a marathon  final negotiating session in Brussels this weekend.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sanaa, March 12 (AFP) -- President 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih Saturday urged the people of Yemen to oppose any attempt  to divide the country, calling for talks to resolve its  seven-month-old political crisis.    In a national address marking the end of the Moslem fasting  month of Ramadan, he said: "We must not tolerate any attempts to  break the country's unity or to provoke sedition or war."    North and South Yemen were unified in May 1990, but a crisis  broke out in August when Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, a  southerner, refused to take up his duties in Sanaa, demanding  major political and economic reforms.    Salih, a northerner, added: "Those who think Yemen's  problems  can be solved by dividing (the country) are wrong."    He called for talks to resolve all differences with al-Bid,  his main political rival.    Tensions have been building in Yemen in recent weeks between  rival north and south armies, despite a February 20  reconciliation accord.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Valeriy Demidetskiy, </F> Anatoliy Kholodyuk]    [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau], 19 Jun -- The second  anniversary of the Bendery tragedy was commemorated in the  Dniester region today.    Exactly two years ago, this area on the banks of the  Dniester  river was engulfed in a bloodbath, which left hundreds dead and  thousands refugees. The madness was halted on 21 July 1992 when  an agreement was signed in Moscow between Moldavia [Moldova] and  Russia and a contingent of combined Russian, Moldavian, and  Dniester peacekeeping troops was sent into the conflict zone.  Thanks to their efforts, a fragile peace has been maintained in  the area and talks have begun on finding a peaceful settlement  for the crisis. Russia and the CSCE are mediating at these.  This was announced at a rally today in Bendery attended by  thousands in memory of those killed.    At the rally, a speech by 14th Army Commander General  Aleksandr Lebed was greeted by whistles when he criticized the  leadership of the Dniester region, accusing it of corruption and  reluctance to solve the conflict by peaceful means. Among other  things, the general said in his speech that the Tiraspol leaders  repaid Russia with base ingratitude when it sent its fighters to  Moscow during last year's October events.</p>

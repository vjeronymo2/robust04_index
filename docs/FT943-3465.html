			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Ashdown unveils team reshuffle Mr Paddy Ashdown yesterday announced a revamped parliamentary team as part of the Liberal Democrats' campaign to combat Mr Tony Blair's revitalised Labour party. The revamp coincided with a stark warning from Mr Charles Kennedy, party president, of the challenge facing the Liberal Democrats. Mr Kennedy, who will step down at the annual conference in Brighton next week, rejected claims that Mr Blair's election signaled the end of the Liberal Democrats as a political force. But he said the party would have to 'keep raising our game' to keep pace with Labour and the Conservatives. 'I was originally in the Labour Party but I don't feel tempted back now and I don't believe all this tosh about the arrival of Tony Blair meaning the end of the Liberal Democrats,' Mr Kennedy writes in Parliament's House Magazine. Mr Ashdown's reshuffle is intended to make better use of the party's 23 MPs. He has also set up a committee of senior MPs and party officials to improve long-term planning. Mr Alan Beith, the deputy leader, has been moved from the Treasury brief to home affairs in place of Mr Robert Maclennan, who will take over as party president. Mr Beith, who is thought to have wanted to retain the Treasury role, has been given a bigger organisational role as chairman of the weekly meeting of MPs, traditionally chaired by the leader. Mr Malcolm Bruce, previously trade, industry and employment spokesman, will head the Treasury, economics and environment team. Mr Menzies Campbell, the defence spokesman, moves to foreign affairs, defence and overseas development. He replaces Sir David Steel, the former Liberal leader, who is to step down as an MP at the next general election.</p>

			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / International Company News: American Express may cut rate AMERICAN Express, the US charge card company, is, for the first time, considering cutting the rate it charges some merchants who accept its cards. It insists, however, the move is likely to affect 'a very small number.' The company has faced highly-publicised revolts over the past year by some groups of merchants who complain that it charges them a substantially higher fee for bills paid with its cards than those levied by rivals Visa and Mastercard. Amexco has repeatedly refused to lower its rates, which provide a more critical element of its income than that of Visa or Mastercard issuers, who earn much of their profits from cardholders' interest payments. Mr Harvey Golub, chairman of Amexco's card business, told travel agents in Florida that the group was considering greater flexibility in its rates for some merchants in special circumstances, such as those with highly seasonal businesses. An Amexco spokeswoman said rates reflected the amount of business a merchant conducted through the company on an annual basis. This penalised seasonal businesses, since their charges might be concentrated in just a few months of the year. She said any such change would only apply to 'very rare' cases and would affect a minimal number of merchants using the Amexco card. Amexco, she added, had no plans to alter its general pricing structure, which depends on three main factors - a merchants' industry, charge card volume, and whether the merchant submits charges electronically or by paper. Nevertheless, the fact that Amexco is prepared to open up this chink in its pricing structure in the hope of better relations with merchants, underlines the intense competition it faces in the card industry, and the pressures facing merchants' profits during a consumer recession.</p>

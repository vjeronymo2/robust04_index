			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Fading influence of ghosts of Clydeside past: The differences between industrial disputes in the 1970s and those of today PICKETING the gates of Yarrow Shipbuilders union official John Dolan dismisses the ghost of Red Clydeside with a shrug. 'This dispute has been eight months brewing. On Red Clydeside they would just have walked out on the first day,' he says. The 1,300 men of Yarrow Shipbuilders are settling in for their second week of an indefinite strike over wages, while next door the 550 workers of Leyland Daf's Albion axles plant have voted for industrial action in the hope of putting pressure on the government to help the stricken truckmaker. The Clydeside setting of the neighbouring disputes lends them a resonance beyond their real moment, but there are some parallels with the 1960s and 1970s. Then there were frequent disputes, culminating in the 1972 work-in at Upper Clyde Shipbuilders after its closure was announced . The work-in added to pressure on the Heath government, which eventually agreed to provide state support to the yards, abandoning its policy of refusing to salvage 'lame ducks' at a time of high unemployment - then about 1m. For all the parallels, Mr Jimmy Airlie, one of the leaders of the UCS work-in, does not see the Yarrow dispute and the Daf strike vote as the rebirth of confrontational unionism in Scotland. 'There is no direct link between the two current disputes, no trend, and the political context has changed completely.' Mr Airlie, now the AEEU electrical and engineering union's executive council member for Scotland, says the two groups of workers share a heritage within which industrial action remains a legitimate last resort. The Yarrow dispute owes as much to Lady Thatcher's 1980s as it does to the decades before. The men say they are not being rewarded adequately for the low pay rises and changes in working practices which helped to keep the yard going and to win the Pounds 700m in orders now on its books. Skilled workers do boilermakers' work as a matter of course and wages have been kept so low that most of their wives must work too, they say. The company points out that to win the orders it had to put in competitive bids, which assumed low costs. Some things never change. The workforce which rejected the company's above-inflation pay offer - against the advice of union officials - says the management style of Mr Murray Easton, Yarrow's managing director, is partly to blame for the deadlock. He is the son of the company's former manager director and the workforce says it is offended by his 'spoilt wee boy' approach to negotiations. The workforce is deeply opposed to this year's pay settlement being expressed as a Pounds 300 lump sum, rather than an increase in basic pay which would be reflected in holiday pay and eventual pension benefits. Mr Francis McNeill, who has worked for Yarrow for 18 years, says: 'We have had more than 800 redundancies in the last 14 months. We just had to sit back and accept it. We had no press coverage although there were guys tapped on the shoulder at two and three in the morning and told to go. They called a strike over 67 job losses down the road at Daf's'</p>

			<p><P> August 3, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DOW REACTS TO MIDEAST, DROPS 54.95;  </P> <P> INDEX OFF 120 EARLY IN SESSION; VOLUME HITS HIGH FOR YEAR  </P> <P> Stocks closed sharply lower today although they managed to rebound as bargain  hunters were encouraged by signs the Middle East conflict may be easing.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, after being down 120 points at its  midsession low, closed with a 54.95-point loss at 2,809.65.  </P> <P> Declining issues outnumbered advances by a one-sided margin on the New York  Stock Exchange.  </P> <P> Big Board volume reached a 1990 high of 292.36 million shares, against 253.09  million in the previous session.  </P> <P> The NYSE's composite index fell 3.53 to 188.83.  </P> <P> The market snapped back from depressed levels on a statement by Soviet Foreign  Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze that Iraq had assured Moscow it would withdraw  from Kuwait soon.  </P> <P> However, the mood on Wall Street remained bearish, with traders viewing the  price explosion on world oil markets and a government report showing  unemployment at the highest level in two years as threatening serious  inflation.  </P> <P> The Labor Department reported this morning that nonfarm payroll employment fell  by 219,000 in July, surprising analysts who had been looking for a modest  increase.  </P> <P> The civilian unemployment rate jumped 3/10ths of a percentage point, to 5.5%.  </P> <P> Those figures reinforced concern in the financial world that economic activity  was weakening more than had been thought just a few weeks ago.  </P> <P> Many observers fear the economy's problems could be compounded by a jump in oil  prices arising from Iraq's invasion of Kuwait this week.  </P> <P> Selling intensified as reports reached Wall Street that Iraqi forces were near  the border of Saudi Arabia. It subsequently let up a bit when a Soviet official  said Iraq was expected to withdraw from Kuwait in the near future.  </P> <P> Short-term interest rates tumbled and some bond prices bobbed up this morning  as traders temporarily ignored the inflationary implications of a possibly  prolonged oil price spiral.  </P> <P> Rates on short-term government bills registered the most reaction to a Labor  Department report showing the nation's unemployment rate shot up to 5.5% in  July from 5.2% in June.  </P> <P> The widely awaited report was viewed as an indication that the struggling  economy may be slipping into recession. Last month's jobless rate was the  highest since it hit 5.6% in August, 1988.  </P> <P> The sharp increase largely reflected the economy's loss of 219,000 jobs. Though  about 160,000 of those Americans who lost jobs were temporary census workers  laid off by the government, private industry payrolls also lost 45,000 jobs,  the report said.  </P> <P> Bond market analysts regarded the interest rate improvements today as  unsustainable.  </P> <P> Carl F. Napolitano of R. C. Government Securities Inc. said the spike in oil  prices sparked by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait has reduced the chances that the  Federal Reserve soon will relax its monetary policy.  </P> <P> He said the unfolding crisis in the Middle East, widely expected to drive oil  prices higher around the world and fuel inflation, will outweigh concerns about  the faltering economy and make the Fed reluctant to ease.  </P> <P> The danger would be that the central bank might fan inflation by engineering  lower interest rates. Fighting inflation is the Fed's chief mission.  </P> <P> Intermediate and long-term government bond prices continued to slump this  morning, reflecting pessimism about the possibility of a shift to a more  generous credit policy.  </P> <P> The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond skidded nearly 1/2 point, or $5 per  $1,000 in face value, on top of Thursday's loss of 1 7/32 points. Its yield,  which rises when the bond's price falls, rose to 8.50% from 8.45% late  Thursday.  </P> <P> But prices of short-term governments added 7/32 point to 1/8 point while  intermediate maturities ranged from up 9/32 point to down 9/32 point. Long-term  issues were 13/32 point to 1/2 point higher, according to Telerate Inc., a  financial information service.  </P> <P> The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond  with a $1,000 face value.  </P> <P> The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price  movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or  longer, regained 0.36 to 1,167.73 by late morning. It lost 4.99 points in  Thursday's selloff.  </P> <P> Yields on three-month Treasury bills dropped to 7.52% as the discount plunged  13 basis points to 7.29%. Yields on six-month bills fell to 7.52% as the  discount receded 14 basis points to 7.16%. Yields on one-year bills pulled back  to 7.53% as the discount decreased 16 basis points to 7.04%.  </P></p>

			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Aviation side underpins Aim's 69% recovery AIM GROUP, the South-ampton-based manufacturer of aircraft interiors, mounted a 69 per cent recovery in pre-tax profits in the six months to October 31. The improvement, from Pounds 620,000 to Pounds 1.05m, followed a 26 per cent increase in turnover to Pounds 25.2m (Pounds 20m). The mainstay of the outcome was the aviation division, which increased operating profit to Pounds 1.71m (Pounds 1.03m) on sales of Pounds 19m (Pounds 14.7m). Mr Jeff Smith, chairman and chief executive, said this reflected progress on such projects as the McDonnell Douglas MD-11 and the Saab 2000. He repeated the statement in the annual report that the division's turnover should double by 1994-95. The contracting side, which installs air conditioning mainly in commercial buildings, saw operating profit slump to Pounds 22,000 (Pounds 319,000) on turnover of Pounds 6.18m (Pounds 5.32m). Mr Smith said the second half would be better because more contracts were scheduled for completion. Interest costs declined to Pounds 682,000 (Pounds 716,000). Net debt was expected to be slightly down by the year-end to Pounds 12.5m, giving gearing of 68 per cent (75 per cent). Aim, which is some 53 per cent-owned by Mr Smith and fellow director Mr Caspar MacDonald-Hall, also owes an additional Pounds 6m to its bankers related to its property portfolio. The group's fortunes have revived since last summer when the banks forgave Pounds 2m of the original Pounds 8m property loan and stopped charging interest on the remainder. Mr Smith said Pounds 1m of property had been sold this year and the money had been put into a realisation account ready for repayment of the Pounds 6m in May 1994. Earnings per share rose to 4.8p (2.8p), while the interim dividend is held at 1.5p after a cut last year. Mr Smith said the dividend had not been raised because of the working capital required to finance the expansion of the aviation division.</p>

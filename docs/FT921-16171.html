			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / Forecast 1992: Watershed ahead - A turnaround for east Europe's output is near For Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia, 1991 saw expectations lowered and hopes deferred. But 1992 has the potential to rekindle both in these three countries - the fastest reforming ones of eastern Europe - and, through their example, in those that follow them. What is needed is internal and external political stability: stable government in Poland; harmonious relations between Czechs and Slovaks; and co-operation within the new Commonwealth of Independent States, formerly the Soviet Union. The European Community is playing a modestly supportive role. Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia signed association agreements with the EC in December. The agreements disappoint earlier hopes of rapid movement to free access and full membership. But they do represent significant advances towards relaxing constraints on sensitive imports of agricultural products, textiles, steel and chemicals. They also reiterate the goal of membership. Developments to their south and east underline the importance of western markets to Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia. Markets in Yugoslavia, Albania, Bulgaria and Romania are diminishing or dislocated. Meanwhile, the problems of smoothing trade between the members of the Commonwealth of Independent States must place a big question mark over sales in that region for a while. Domestic markets in reforming countries will continue to be limited by the need to balance budgets and contain inflation. In both these respects, however, Czechoslovakia is living up to its long-established reputation for stability. Yet even its official forecast for 1992 does not predict the the zero inflation achieved for several months in 1991. Hungary's inflation rate has increased to nearly 40 per cent, partly because the needs of debt service (and its low foreign exchange reserves) made a competitive exchange rate take priority over exchange rate stabilisation as a counter-inflationary anchor. A tougher policy is probable in 1992, so that inflation should fall. Meanwhile, the Polish budget has pursued an erratic path, influenced by fiscal retrenchment and swings in the profitability of state-owned enterprises. With output still falling, immediate prospects are disturbing; heightened inflation is a real possibility. All these countries have adopted a crawling adjustment of the exchange rate against an explicit basket of hard currencies. This policy should allow reconciliation of positive real domestic interest rates and lower nominal hard currency interest rates, with more realistic exchange rate expectations. A crawling exchange rate is more credible and reassuring to markets than either a vague commitment to hold a particular rate for an uncertain period, or no more than a partial accommodation of differential cost movements. The latter would make the recovery of lost competitiveness depend on getting inflation below that in the EC and North America. The implausibility of this achievement adds to the discouragement attendant on recent trends in output  -falling at about 10 per cent a year. These recessionary forces explain rising unemployment, now beginning to exceed 10 per cent in the reforming countries. They also complicate both privatisation, as more enterprises become unprofitable and difficult to sell, and restructuring, which typically involves labour shedding - a politically fraught development when unemployment is high. Typically, governments have recognised that restructuring cannot be left entirely to new owners after privatisation, either because privatisation is going to be delayed, or because new owners face problems in controlling managements historically beholden to their employees. The exception is Czechoslovakia, which has not been discouraged from issuing to the people vouchers which can be exchanged for shares in state enterprises. Poland has substantially reduced the list of enterprises to be privatised through share distributions to the population. It also continues to see a role for special intermediaries. These intermediaries are expected to reconcile the need to concentrate the functions of ownership with the very wide ownership implied, at least initially, by mass distribution. Hungary, by contrast, continues to rely on conventional channels for its more gradual privatisation, which has been made easier by steps taken over the previous two decades to introduce market forces and market mechanisms. Hungary has also benefited from more developed financial markets. Its long experience with market mechanisms is reflected in Hungary's success in attracting about a half of all the foreign direct investment in 1991. A total of about Dollars 3bn in such investment is modest in relation to the area's needs, but uncertainty about property rights, about the solvency of trading partners, about economic institutions and even about political stability, all act to reduce the inflow. The role of the capital market in the finance of the area's industry remains unclear. In due course, stock markets will allow active trading in shares of mass-privatised enterprises. But most commentators also see merit in active finance by banks, which might also take small equity stakes, on the German or Japanese model. Even though these bank share holdings would not be large enough for control, banks could play a role in guiding and monitoring management. With output having fallen by about 20 per cent over two years, the turning point is seen to be near by several international agencies - most recently by the OECD, which places it within the next two years. But since restructuring is likely to stimulate a growth of productivity, unemployment will go on rising. This will feed pressures for migration. Since full EC membership would entail freedom of movement, rising unemployment might well defer that prospect. In the meantime, the greater the access to its markets the west allows, the greater the benefits to both parties. If the west wishes to offer assistance to obsolescent western industries that suffer from eastern competition it should do so in forms, like retraining, that do not frustrate the trade or exhaust its benefits. Eastern countries should be encouraged to liberalise imports rapidly if they can devise and finance means, such as retraining and temporary employment subsidies, to assist their industrial adjustment.

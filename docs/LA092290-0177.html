			<p><P> September 22, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JAPANESE STILL BUYING BUT IN SUBTLER WAYS;  </P> <P> INVESTMENT: FOREIGN MONEY IS GOING PAST THE 'TROPHIES' IN THE UNITED STATES AND  TOWARD MORE SOPHISTICATED VENTURES.  </P> <P> Japanese purchases of U.S. "trophies" such as Rockefeller Center and Columbia  Pictures had slacked off until a Tokyo tycoon bought Pebble Beach Co., with its  exquisite golf courses and lone cypress tree.  </P> <P> But don't be deceived by fewer high-profile deals. The Japanese appetite for  U.S. investment remains powerful, despite Japanese government pressure to tone  down purchases and a nearly 40% drop in the value of stocks in that country  this year.  </P> <P> In fact, the Japanese are making more U.S. investments than ever, and more  sophisticated ones, as they become confident enough to look past blue-chip  targets.  </P> <P> "They're becoming insiders in the United States," said Jack Barthell, a  managing partner of the Los Angeles accounting firm Kenneth Leventhal &amp;  Co., which closely tracks Japanese investment.  </P> <P> Nowhere is that more apparent than in real estate, Leventhal's specialty.  Having moved from office buildings to hotels to resorts and golf courses, the  Japanese are now developing property, often in partnership with U.S. companies,  here and abroad, Barthell said.  </P> <P> While their total real estate investment fell by 11% from 1988 to 1989, to  $14.8 billion, "the volume of transactions was way up," Barthell said.  </P> <P> The Japanese also are moving from primary investment areas, such as Honolulu,  Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York, to other metro areas and the suburbs.  </P> <P> A Leventhal study showed that four-fifths of total investment was in the  primary areas in 1985; by last year, the figure was about one-third.  </P> <P> "We're finding the very distinct move from the archetypal downtown trophy  office tower to developing single-family residential in the suburbs, or even  apartments," Barthell said.  </P> <P> Another new target zone is Europe, where Japanese real estate investment last  year was twice the level of 1988 and nearly 4 1/2 times that of 1987, according  to Clark Whitehill, a British accounting firm.  </P> <P> A prominent example of the trends is the Japanese subsidiary Shuwa Investments  Corp., which owns $2.7 billion in U.S. real estate. Shuwa led the charge into  office towers, buying the ITT Corp. headquarters in New York, the U.S. News and  World Report building in Washington, the Arco Plaza in Los Angeles, and the  Quaker Tower in Chicago.  </P> <P> But during the past year, Shuwa made different kinds of headlines: announcing  plans to build luxury apartments in Los Angeles; forming a $154-million  partnership with Los Angeles-based Tishman West Cos. in a London office  building.  </P> <P> Many observers say the Japanese were surprised last year by the harshness of  U.S. reaction to high-profile deals. Those included Mitsubishi Estate Co.'s  $846-million purchase of a controlling stake in New York's Rockefeller Center,  and Sony Corp.'s $3.4-billion purchase of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.  </P> <P> Despite the negative publicity, the Japanese still appear ready to buy U.S.  landmarks if the circumstances are right.  </P> <P> Those acquainted with this month's deal for Pebble Beach, where a round of golf  can cost $175 and the scenic 17-Mile Drive winds past the often-photographed  lone cypress, say competition was vicious between two final bidders, both  Japanese.  </P> <P> Finally, businessman Minoru Isutani bought the Monterey property for more than  $800 million from a partnership that included Beverly Hills billionaire Marvin  Davis.  </P> <P> But Davis' asking price was much higher, some say $1.2 billion. And Isutani is  a special case. Because he owns an empire of golf clubs and sporting goods  companies in Japan and abroad, he can exploit Pebble Beach with  cross-memberships and marketing tie-ins of all sorts.  </P> <P> So even the top-dollar price for Pebble Beach is not interpreted as a sign of a  new rush for mega-deals.  </P> <P> "The situations where a guy walked around Manhattan or Waikiki with a wad of  money in his pocket and bought the first overpriced property are gone," said  Daniel Schwartz, managing director at Ulmer Brothers Inc., a New York  investment bank specializing in deals involving the Japanese.  </P> <P> Research at Ulmer Brothers shows the trend extends beyond real estate to  investing in and buying out U.S. businesses. In the first half of 1990, the  company counted 103 such mergers and acquisitions. That compared with 74 in the  first half of 1989 and 47 in the same period in 1988.  </P> <P> At the same time, the average deal size fell from $162 million in 1988 to $51  million this year. That reflects the fact that the Japanese increasingly are  taking minority stakes in U.S. businesses, often to provide new capital,  Schwartz said.  </P> <P> "A lot of U.S. companies have found themselves in trouble, and the ones with  money are overseas, the Japanese and Europeans," he said.  </P> <P> The Japanese also have become quicker to back away from overpriced deals,  Schwartz noted. Whitman Corp. had hoped to get $700 million for its Hussmann  Corp. commercial refrigerator unit in St. Louis, then pulled it off the market  when Sanyo Electric Co.'s bid came in substantially lower, he said.  </P> <P> Similarly, Hilton Hotels Corp. removed its "for-sale" sign this year after bids  came in far below the $120 per share some analysts expected. Several Japanese  companies, including the leisure and real estate conglomerate EIE  International, had been interested.  </P></p>

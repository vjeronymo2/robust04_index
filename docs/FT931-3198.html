			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget: Sharp drop in petroleum tax rate THE chancellor yesterday took the oil industry by storm with a large-scale overhaul of North Sea petroleum taxes. The industry had no inkling beforehand that he would be proposing such sharp reductions in taxes accompanied by a virtual elimination of tax allowances. The chancellor said he would reduce the Petroleum Revenue Tax rate on existing oilfields from 75 per cent to 50 per cent and eliminate it altogether for new fields. He also said he would abolish PRT rules that allow expenditure on new exploration and development to be set against profits of existing fields. Mr Harold Hughes, who heads the industry group the UK Offshore Operators' Association, said the tax changes would put a 'substantial burden on the industry at a time when it is stretched economically by low oil prices and high costs'. The chancellor's changes will vastly simplify the tax regime in the North Sea, cutting 300 pages of bureaucratic legislation on PRT and updating the tax rules. 'It will be brilliant,' said Mr Tony Craven-Walker, managing director of Monument Oil and Gas. 'It will make the system so much more simple.' Monument will not stand to gain from the changes since it is not exposed to PRT. Large companies such as British Petroleum could gain as much as Pounds 130m from the change according to some analysts. BP said last night that it expected the changes to work favourably for it. But the operators' association believes exploration costs in the North Sea could quadruple. This would hit the smallest companies hardest and cut drilling activity. The chancellor said existing PRT rules had cost the exchequer Pounds 200m in 1991-92 rather than providing the revenue stream that was intended when PRT was introduced in 1975. He said the changes would bring Pounds 300m into the government's coffers in 1994-95 and Pounds 400m the following year. However, Mr Hughes disputed the figures and said they would be much higher. The chancellor said PRT had become increasingly anachronistic since its introduction and represented a marginal tax rate of 83 per cent. He said this gave no incentive to companies to keep their costs under control or make the most of their investments. Oil companies have dreamed up many ways of offsetting PRT over the years and some production assets and even companies have been bought and sold on the basis of the tax shelter they offer.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Prague, April 15 (TANJUG) -- President of the  republic of Serb Krajina Milan Martic on Friday ruled out any  possibility that Krajina be a part of Croatia.    "The only way to peace is the separation of Krajina from  Croatia," Martic underscored in the Krajina political seat of  Knin in an interview to the Belgrade correspondent of the Czech  CTK news agency. "Life together is absolutely out of the  question," he said.    "The sooner this reality is accepted, life will be better in  Krajina and in Croatia," Martic said.    "Theoretically, it is possible, if Croats amend their  constitution, that the (Krajina) people might agree to  co-existence. And yet, even then, it would have to be solely  through the will of the people," Martic warned.    ``As far as I am concerned, personally, I would never  approve  that. I do not trust Croats...(because) Serbs have bitter  experiences [words indistinct] the Krajina president said from  [passage indistinct]    Martic also strongly denied that President Slobodan  Milosevic  of the Yugoslav Republic of Serbia had pressured him to get  Krajina Serbs to agree to autonomy within Croatia in exchange  for the lifting of the international embargo against the Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia.    "Milosevic is for us to chose our own way," Martic  underscored.    Martic sees a compromise by the Serb side not in agreement  to  autonomy within Croatia, but in the restoration of economic  cooperation and comprehensive normalization of mutual ties. "The  main condition is -- equal relations between the republic of  Serb Krajina and Croatia as two independent states."    "We are for peace, but not at all costs. We shall not buckle  down under supposedly democratic pressure to give up our right  to self-determination," Martic (?concluded). [passage omitted]</p>

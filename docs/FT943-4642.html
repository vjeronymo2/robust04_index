			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Aircraft market expected to see recovery in 1996 The slump in world aviation markets is almost over and the industry can expect orders for 16,730 new passenger aircraft worth Dollars 898bn over the next 20 years, according to a market forecast issued yesterday by Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa). The Daimler-Benz subsidiary said it expected the market would start to recover in 1996 and pinpointed the Asia-Pacific region as the most promising market. It predicted mergers or closures in the commuter aircraft business, which would feel pressure from high-speed trains. Global annual traffic growth for jets seating more than 70 was likely to average 4.7 per cent - 3.2 per cent in North America, 4.1 per cent in Europe and 6.3 per cent in Asia. Including 5,310 replacements, total orders would reach 11,300 in this sector. The European Airbus consortium, in which Dasa has a 37.9 per cent stake, would maintain its market share at over 30 per cent for the rest of the current decade, the company said. Demand for a total of 5,430 mainly turbo-prop commuter aircraft, including 2,780 replacements, would be bolstered by an annual average traffic increase of 5.5 per cent - 4.5 per cent in North America, 5.3 per cent in Europe and 7.7 per cent in Asia. Dasa, which supplies the Fokker 50 and the newly launched Dornier 328 regional aircraft to this sector, expected worldwide annual deliveries to average 270 commuter craft, rising to around 400 at the end of the forecast period. The company had already delivered 10 Dornier 328s, had orders on hand for 46 and had 50 options. It expected 350 orders over the next 10 to 15 years, a spokesman said. According to the Dasa forecasters, who studied more than 500 airlines with an overall fleet of 13,290, competition from high-speed trains would reduce potential demand from European airlines for commuter aircraft by 7 per cent  -equivalent to 220 aircraft. While the market for larger jets would be shared by Boeing, McDonnell Douglas and Airbus Industrie as industry consolidation came to an end, over-capacity and price competition would force mergers or closures among the 10 existing commuter aircraft suppliers, Dasa predicted. Average carrying capacity of jets would rise from 182 seats to 236 by the end of the review period, while commuter aircraft would have 36 seats compared with 33 at present.</p>

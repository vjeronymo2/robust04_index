			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Hanson For the UK market, Hanson's sale of its ICI stake is open to two opposite interpretations. The bulls will assume the Hanson mega-bid is finally arriving on Monday morning. The bears will infer that Lord Hanson, having made a 17 per cent capital gain in a year when the FT-SE rose 11 per cent, is now calling the turn in the market. The bull case owes more to the market's fevered state of mind than to logic. In the context of the imagined mega-bid, the Pounds 280m proceeds from the ICI stake are loose change. More to the point, the whole ICI episode has proved, if not a fiasco, then at least an embarrassment for which Pounds 40m gross capital gain is meagre compensation. It would be an odd time, surely, for Hanson to plunge into another venture on such a scale. As for calling the turn on equities, the truth could be less dramatic. In selling Ever Ready and the ICI stake and issuing a Pounds 500m Eurobond, Hanson may simply have calculated that with the world's bankers staring at black holes like Olympia &amp; York, this is a good time to reduce bank debt.</p>

			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE FOOTBALL;  </P> <P> MIAMI HURRICANES SHOULD STORM TO TOP  </P> <P> Howard Schnellenberger, Jimmy Johnson, Dennis Erickson: No one misses a beat.  </P> <P> The Miami Hurricanes, always a little ostentatious, should add another national  title to the three that Schnellenberger, Johnson and Erickson won in the past  decade.  </P> <P> The team of the 1980s moves into the 1990s as the defending national champion.  It will take a great effort to dethrone it.  </P> <P> "My expectations are high, so the pressure continues every year," said  Erickson, who coached the Hurricanes to the 1989 national title in his first  year at the school. "Realistically, we know we are not going to win the  national championship every year. But the pressure is still there."  </P> <P> And so is the ability.  </P> <P> No. 1: MIAMI. Quarterback Craig Erickson, a prime Heisman Trophy candidate, is  one of eight returning starters on offense. He'll hand off to fullback Leonard  Conley and pass to Randal Hill, Wesley Carroll and Rob Chudzinski.  </P> <P> The defense, which held opponents to 9.3 points per game, will be younger, but  defensive tackle Russell Maryland is back to anchor the line. The Hurricanes  are deep in linebackers and experienced on the corners. And then there is  Carlos Hureta, one of the best placekickers in the country.  </P> <P> No. 2: NOTRE DAME. The Irish will break in a new quarterback (Rick Mirer, a  6-foot-3, 212- pound sophomore), a new offense (Mirer is a classic pocket  passer) and try to put out rumors fired up by a Sports Illustrated article that  suggests widespread use of steroids on the team.  </P> <P> The offense will miss five starters, including QB Tony Rice. But junior flanker  Raghib Ismail is ready to fly. On defense, only one veteran returns to the  secondary, but two players are back from the 1988 championship team: senior  defensive tackle George Williams from academic suspension and senior linebacker  Michael Stonebreaker after a disciplinary suspension.  </P> <P> No. 3: AUBURN. The Sporting News picked the Tigers to be No. 1. They could pull  it off, with seven home games and nemesis Alabama in Birmingham. Coach Pat Dye  has a veteran line to protect new quarterback Frank McIntosh and a "big play"  defense, with nose guard Walter Tate (6-2, 306) and tackles David Rocker (6-4,  264) and Fernando Horn (6-5, 270).  </P> <P> No. 4: COLORADO. QB Sal Aunese died a year ago. His ghost is at rest. If the  Buffaloes challenge for the national title, they'll do it on their own by  working overtime, following a 31-31 tie with Tennessee. QB Darian Hagan, a  Heisman candidate, tailback Eric Bieniemy and linebackers Alfred Williams and  Kanavis McGhee excel.  </P> <P> No. 5: FLORIDA STATE. Coach Bobby Bowden has a new lifetime contract, but hopes  it doesn't take that long to get a victory in a season opener. The last two  years Bowden saw title hopes crushed by opening losses. Maybe this year the  Seminoles can get it right against East Carolina. Bowden's team has talent, but  little experience. He says that's better than no talent and a lot of  experience.  </P> <P> No. 6: NEBRASKA. The only question is quarterback, where juniors Mickey Joseph  and Mike Grant are dueling for the position vacated by Gerry Gdowski. The  backfield is set with junior Leodis Flowers and Terry Rodgers, the son of  former Nebraska Heisman winner Johnny Rodgers. The defense is anchored by  linemen Kenny Walker and Joe Sims.  </P> <P> No. 7: VIRGINIA. With senior QB Shawn Moore and junior wide receiver Herman  Moore, the Cavs expect more than last season's tie for the Atlantic Coast  Conference title. It has taken coach George Welsh eight years, but he has  finally turned the Cavaliers into a powerhouse.  </P> <P> No. 8: HOUSTON. Defense? Who cares? Coach Jack Pardee is gone, but his  offensive coordinator, John Jenkins, is in command. Junior QB David Klingler  has stepped in for the departed Andre Ware, last season's Heisman winner, and  looks almost as good. The nation's leading receiver, Manny Hazard (12.91 yards  per catch), is back.  </P> <P> No. 9: MICHIGAN. Gary Moeller's coaching ability may remain a secret for a  while. With the talent-laden squad Moeller has, he might not have to do much.  Sophomore quarterback Elvis Grbac, who made an impressive debut last season, is  full time now. Eight starters return on defense.  </P> <P> No. 10: ILLINOIS. The Illini defense will be the key in the absence of  quarterback Jeff George, who left Champaign for the NFL a year early. Nose  tackle Moe Gardner, tackle Sean Streeter and linebacker Darrick Brownlow head  the defense. Sophomore QB Jason Verduzco hopes to fill George's shoes.  </P> <P> No. 11: WEST VIRGINIA. Underrated due to loss of quarterback Major Harris, the  Mountaineers have a major change in personality going with senior QB Greg  Jones. It's called team unity. Familiar faces: Rico Tyler, Garrett Ford and  Mike Beasley. Eye grabber: senior offensive tackle John Ray, at 6-10 and 330  pounds.  </P> <P> No. 12: CLEMSON. The Tigers have a big offensive line, a strong placekicker in  Chris Gardocki, six starters back on defense and an untested quarterback in  junior DeChane Cameron. The biggest question is how they will adjust to new  coach Ken Hatfield.  </P> <P> No. 13: ALABAMA. Coach Gene Stallings may feel blessed, given his inheritance:  Fifteen starters, 10 on offense, from last year's Sugar Bowl team.  </P> <P> No. 14: PITTSBURGH. Pitt fans think they've had the talent for a national title  for years. They expect coach Paul Hackett to deliver. Standouts are sophomore  quarterback Alex Van Pelt and linebacker Ricardo McDonald.  </P> <P> No. 15: TENNESSEE. Last season Johnny Majors came within a hair of his second  national title. This year, with 17 returning starters, the Vols remain close.  </P> <P> No. 16: TEXAS A&amp;M. Senior halfback Darren Lewis has a shot at All-America  status if he remains healthy. If he does, the Aggies have a shot at the  Southwestern Conference title.  </P> <P> No. 17: UCLA. Coach Terry Donahue is trying to forget last season's 3-7-1  record. He's hired former offensive wiz Homer Smith to call signals. Three new  defensive coaches, plus transfers Arnold Ale (LB from Notre Dame) and Mike  Chalenski (DE from Pitt) won't hurt.  </P> <P> No. 18: HAWAII. Senior QB Garrett Gabriel makes the offense go. The defense  remains strong. Visitors will find no gold in Rainbows' end zone.  </P> <P> No. 19: USC. QB Todd Marinovich and tailback Ricky Ervins will have to carry  the load until the defense shapes up.  </P> <P> No. 20: WASHINGTON. After 16 years with the Huskies, Coach Don James knows how  to get the job done. If QB Mark Brunell works out, the defense will keep the  Huskies in the Pac-10 race.  </P> <P> No. 21: LOUISVILLE. Veteran QB Browning Nagel continues to lead the Cards  toward coach Howard Schnellenberger's national championship dream.  </P> <P> No. 22: OHIO STATE. Coach John Cooper better shape this team into a Big Ten  contender or get ready to ship out.  </P> <P> No. 23: BYU. The offense is ready with outstanding QB Ty Detmer and running  back Matt Bellini. Time will tell if a defense will show up.  </P> <P> No. 24: PENN STATE. It is good the Nittany Lions have a few years to restock  for the Big Ten. Still, it is Penn State.  </P> <P> No. 25: GEORGIA TECH. For the first time in his four years at Tech, coach Bobby  Ross has a returning starter at quarterback -- sophomore Shawn Jones.  </P></p>

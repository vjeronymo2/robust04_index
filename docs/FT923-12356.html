			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Building sectors The stock market collapse has been notably severe among UK contractors and building materials companies, which have underperformed by nearly 20 and 25 per cent respectively in the last two months. The message, it seems, is finally hitting home that there will be no return for the foreseeable future to the levels of demand of three to four years ago. Businesses will therefore soon be forced to cut capacity - not just costs and working capital - to meet the new economic realities. Depressingly, there may now be a fresh wave of redundancies and provisions, with all that this implies for profit and loss accounts, balance sheets and further dividend cuts. In the process the stock market has become indiscriminate: if sound companies such as Redland and RMC are now correctly priced, there are further falls in store elsewhere.</p>

			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / International Company News: Portuguese investors in Banesto shares scheme PORTUGUESE shareholders in Banco Totta e Acores (BTA), Portugal's third largest commercial bank, will take a stake in Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto) and buy 3m BTA shares through the market in a move designed to strengthen the Portuguese nucleus of investors within BTA. This follows an agreement with Banesto which directly holds just under 10 per cent of BTA. Banesto also has a 49 per cent stake in Valores Ibericos (VI), a Portuguese holding company, which has a 28.6 per cent stake in BTA. The other 51 per cent of VI is held by Portuguese shareholders led by Mr Jose Roquette, BTA president. Mr Roquette said that the Portuguese shareholders had grouped their forces in MSF, a holding company, which would receive their 51 per cent stake in VI in a share transfer. When the share transfer and the purchase of additional BTA shares were completed, VI, MSF, Banesto and other Portuguese shareholders would hold about 49 per cent of BTA. The Portuguese government stills holds 16.15 per cent in the bank. The reminder of the shares is divided among over 40,000 shareholders. The new share structure was agreed with Banesto to put an end to months of uncertainty and disputes about the Spanish bank's intentions towards BTA. BTA has about 210 branches and is expected to show a profit of Es22bn (Dollars 157m) for 1991, about double its profits in the previous year.</p>

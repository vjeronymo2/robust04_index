			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 3 KYODO -- An agreement to leave  government-set wheat prices unchanged for fiscal 1994 will not  affect later negotiations for rice prices, Finance Minister  Hirohisa Fujii said Friday [3 June]. The wheat-price accord  reached earlier Friday by the government and the ruling parties  was the "utmost decision," Fujii said at a news conference after  a morning cabinet meeting,    Under the accord, the price the government pays to farmers  for wheat will be frozen for the third consecutive year.  Conditions for setting wheat prices are different from those  for rice prices, Fujii said. "We must work to win the support  of growers and the public" on rice prices, he added. The area  under cultivation for wheat is on the decline and "simple  calculations" based on supply and demand indicate a need for a  price cut, he said.    Strong opposition within the ruling coalition parties to a  cut in the price paid to wheat growers resulted in the accord to  freeze prices. The government's policy is to lower prices to  narrow the gap between prices at home and abroad. Japan's  government-set wheat prices are about five times world market  levels. Fiscal 1994 government purchase prices for rice will be  decided in early July.    Asked about a reported threat by the national tax  administration agency to withhold licenses to sell beer from  leading supermarket chain Daiei Inc., Fujii said he knew nothing  about it but would look into the matter. Agency officials  reportedly told Daiei that its plans to reduce retail beer  prices despite a recent beer tax hike are "making it difficult"  for the agency to grant licenses to sell alcoholic beverages to  new stores to be opened by Daiei.    Fujii said price-setting is "basically free," but that beer  is "one of the special products that involves various social  problems such as underage drinking and alcoholism."</p>

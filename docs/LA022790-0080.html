			<p><P> February 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Northrop Ad Ban Back in Court: The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals heard  arguments by the federal government about why a ban on a series of Northrop  Corp. "image ads" should be upheld. Assistant U.S. Atty.  </P> <P> Steven G. Madison reiterated the government's position that the ad would  influence a jury in a criminal trial against Northrop that is scheduled to  begin today. The ads feature legendary test pilot Chuck Yeager, who is to  testify on behalf of Northrop at the trial. A Northrop attorney argued that a  ban would be a restraint of Northrop's First Amendment rights of free speech. A  U.S. District judge initially ordered that the defense company be prohibited  from running the ads, but the appeals court Feb. 16 issued an emergency stay of  that order. A three-judge appeals panel, which viewed four of the 11 ads in a  San Francisco courtroom, is expected to rule soon.  </P></p>

			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Managers must earn their options Sir, Attention continues to focus on share options as a means of motivating company management, the size of reward such options can generate and whether shareholders can reasonably expect that such reward is related directly to the underlying financial performance of the company in question. It is perhaps worth restating, therefore, the purpose behind the joint statement last summer by the National Association of Pension Funds and the Association of British Insurers on executive share schemes and performance. Investors quite reasonably encourage management to achieve sustained improvement in the underlying financial performance of the companies in which they have invested. The statement by the two associations promotes that aim. It recognises that performance requirements may need to be tailored to the circumstances of an individual company. For this reason, the statement makes quite clear that it is for the remuneration committees to determine the most appropriate criteria to measure management performance. Linking the exercise of options to the achievement of sustained underlying financial performance by a company must be in the best long-term interests of both the company and its long-term shareholders. If shareholders understand the basis on which the chosen criteria have been set, they will understand and appreciate the effort and achievement of the management in question. The joint statement is not prescriptive and it is encouraging that companies are increasingly acknowledging the desirability of relating the significant returns that can be realised from executive share options to a sustained level of performance by the management in question and not simply the general level of share prices from time to time. Angus W Matheson, chairman, investment committee, National Association of Pension Funds, David M Simpson, chairman, investment committee, Association of British Insurers, London</p>

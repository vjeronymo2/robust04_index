			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview Vladimir Kolesnichenko, vice president of the </F> Maritime Joint-Stock Goods Producers Company, by VLADIVOSTOK  correspondent Vitaliy Korytko; place and date not given:  "Vladimir Kolesnichenko: PACT Is Ready To Take Upon Itself the  Burden of Structural Restructuring of the Kray Economy"]    [Text] As is known, the "PACT [Maritime Joint-Stock  Goods Producers Company] case," which certain circles have very  persistently tried to make look strictly criminal, drew a  blank--the competent organs did not find any serious violations  in this organization's activities and therefore refused to  initiate criminal proceedings. Nevertheless, let us not forget  that for a long time PACT's name has been literally a permanent  fixture on the pages of some local newspapers (now no longer  published), which organized the hounding of "red directors," who  allegedly [line missing] of Maritime Kray's economic  potential... PACT's real work meanwhile remained, as they say,  outside the framework.    Our VLADIVOSTOK correspondent asked PACT's Vice  President Vladimir Kolesnichenko to describe what this  organization was really doing and what it intends to do after  its "exoneration."    [Kolesnichenko] All this time we have been doing the same  thing as before--developing within PACT's framework a mechanism  for structural restructuring of the kray economy.    Why did we of all people undertake this task? PACT, which is  a financial-industrial group, or consortium, is the first  structure in Russia set up on the Western model, with an  orientation toward a high degree of survivability in a  free-market environment--both of the corporation as a whole and  each of its component enterprises.    In short, we took as a basis the "keiretsu"  system--currently  the most effective form of enterprise integration in the world.  Having integrated themselves into a multisectoral concern, which  typically has its own bank, trading companies, joint ownership  of stock, and so on, these enterprises orient themselves in  terms of earning profits mainly at investing in the most  promising developments, as well as further commercialization of  interrelated products and markets. This, by the way, explains  why Japan, where the "keiretsu" system is most widely used, is  winning the competition against the United States today.    In September of last year the Ministry of the Economy  approved the initiative to create PACT; a decision was made to  conduct an experiment and then extend our experience to all of  Russia, testimony of which was the president's December decree  on the creation of financial-industrial groups in the country.  Then, however, political intrigues around PACT began, involving  audits by uncountable commissions from the government, financial  organs, the procuracy, and even state security, which, although  not quite paralyzing the organization's activities, did  considerably slow down the work on structural restructuring that  had at first taken off very energetically. Now the situation has  changed.    No matter how much Government Decree No. 1001 is berated, it  has been implemented at least in one respect: The kray has been  granted a very preferential rate in paying for electric power  (40 rubles [R] per kilowatt). Had it not been for this, the kray  economy would have ground to a halt as early as last fall. In  May, however, we expect a sharp jump in thermal-electric power  rates for industrial consumers--the government says that it is  no longer able to maintain such low rates. It is not difficult  to predict what will happen then--half the enterprises will find  themselves on the brink of bankruptcy, and a considerable part  of the labor force (in our estimates, between 20 and 40 percent)  may be laid off. That is, we have practically approached the  point of having no time left for "contemplation."    A considerable part of PACT is comprised of former defense  enterprises reorganized into joint-stock companies and  undergoing conversion. The situation there is very difficult  now. Military production at these enterprises for all practical  purposes has been suspended; people are not paid wages (or if  they are paid, it is in miserable amounts), but neither are they  told what to do. Maintenance of these "dead" production  facilities is done essentially at the expense of stockholders,  which is a road straight to bankruptcy.    In other words, collectives have found themselves in a sort  of economic trap. Very soon annual stockholder meetings will  begin at these enterprises, and people may demand dividends on  their stock. They have a right to ask the board of every AO  [joint-stock company]: Why do banks and investment funds produce  capital and pay dividends, and you cannot? What we would like to  do is to decide at each such meeting--taking into account  stockholders' opinion, of course--what to produce, which  production may be halted, where to sell the products, and so on.  But first the government must decide where it stands and finally  say clearly that at such and such enterprises in the kray it is  in the interests of the state to produce such and such output in  such and such volume, etc. Our proposals in this respect,  including full conversion of defense enterprises, are already in  the State Committee on Industry and are a component part of the  kray program of structural restructuring of the economy. The  government is preparing its own version of such restructuring,  but in principle the entire burden of practical implementation  will fall on the kray.    We have to our own thinking--no good uncle will help us in  this--on how to preserve jobs by starting production of  competitive products that consumers need, and finding markets  for their distribution--including abroad. It will probably be a  very painful process. Structural restructuring of the economy is  no rose garden; some lay-offs are inevitable, and therefore, I  want to repeat, the priority problem we will have to deal with  is how and where to employ these people. This is not a problem  that is limited to PACT. Structural restructuring will extend to  the entire kray, and this is at a time when we cannot really  count on any significant help on the part of the state.    In our calculations, structural restructuring of the kray  economy in 1994 will require R2.3 trillion in current prices;  nobody will give us this kind of money, of course. But we have a  kind of counterproposal to the state: Since you do not have this  money, let us work on signing an agreement with China on sales  of Maritime Kray products in its markets, first and foremost in  its northern provinces. There is no doubt that our industrial  potential is higher than that at many Chinese enterprises, and  therefore we can be competitive with them. The same may be said  regarding the markets of North Korea, Vietnam, Thailand, and  Indonesia. We should not be afraid to take our products there;  we also need to look for investors and find them. For instance,  we already have concrete developments with respect to investment  intents on the part of a number of Taiwanese companies.    Over the past year the consolidated profit of PACT  enterprises amounted to R87 billion. This is a considerable  amount, but probably is not enough for every one of the  corporation's component enterprises. What enterprises are in  most acute need of today is first and foremost capital, money.  Since we cannot count on outside help, we in PACT intend to  apply internally the method of "pulling ourselves up by the  bootstraps." The substance of this is that the government will  give us the right, so to say, on a tax-free basis to direct part  of the profits generated, for instance, by Dalpribor, into the  development of, for instance, a Vladivostok meat-processing  plant. We are not talking about "charity" here--this project  will be presented to Dalpribor stockholders, with the length of  time needed to receive a payoff and returns on investment, the  prospects for the new production, etc. This is what structural  restructuring is: First we pull up one segment, then another...  I am convinced that today this is the only real way, which we  need to take.    Of course, some may think that there is too much abstract  reasoning in this. What structural restructuring of the economy,  they say--people have to live today, and wages are low... But in  most cases this is precisely why they are so low--there is no  way to pay more if production is either idle or operating at  half capacity, producing goods that accumulate in warehouses and  cannot be sold. Therefore, as I have already said, the  "wait-and-see" period is over, unless we shift production as  soon as possible into making products everyone needs, while  preserving jobs (or creating new ones), unless we find new  distribution markets, unless we train a completely new type of  managers to run these enterprises, and do many other things, the  crisis in the kray economy may indeed reach extremes.    The time of uncertainty and talk is over; it is time to act  now. PACT is ready to be the first to start this difficult work.</p>

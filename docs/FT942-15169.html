			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / International Company News: German bank plans derivatives subsidiary Commerzbank, the smallest of Germany's big three banks, yesterday announced plans to set up a subsidiary for trading in derivatives. Mr Martin Kohlhaussen, chief executive, said the unit, the first in Germany, would increase the bank's involvement in vibrant derivatives activities. He said: 'There is no reason to leave the lion's share of this business in the hands of our international competitors.' He said the new company, to be called Commerz Financial Products, would have offices in London, Paris, New York, Tokyo and Singapore, with its headquarters in Frankfurt. CFP will have start-up capital of DM100m (Dollars 58.8m). The bank plans to bundle all its existing derivatives activities - with the exception of currency-related products - under the roof of the new organisation. Last year, the total volume of derivatives business, including currency transactions, was DM487bn, 171 per cent of the balance sheet total. Excluding currency transactions, derivatives volume was only 84 per cent of the balance sheet, with credit exposure of a net DM3bn. The announcement came as Commerzbank rounded off the reporting season for German banks by announcing a 25 per cent rise in operating profits, to DM1.13bn last year, after taking account of provisions for bad debts. Mr Kohlhaussen attributed last year's lively increase to robust growth in interest income (up 12 per cent to DM4.85bn) and fee income (up 22 per cent to DM1.96bn), as well as record results on own-account securities trading. Trading income more than doubled to DM550m. Provisions against bad debts fell 14.9 per cent to DM1.77bn, in spite of the depth of the German recession. Mr Kohlhaussen said this reflected profits on the sale of problem-country debt. Partial operating profits had shown 'good double-digit growth' in January and February.</p>

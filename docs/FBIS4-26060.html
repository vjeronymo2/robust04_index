			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Xie Yicheng: "Air China Inks $47 Million Deal for </F> Simulators]    [Text] Air China is spending millions to improve flight  safety with devices for better pilot training on the mainland.    The nation's flagship carrier formally placed a $47 million  order yesterday with Canada for three full-flight simulators  that replicate conditions for Boeing 747s, 737s, 767s and 757s.    The deal was inked in Beijing between heads of the airline,  CAE Electronics of Canada and China Aviation Supplies  Corporation (CASC) which will handle imports.    "This is telling evidence of Air China's resolve not only to  be the leader of civil aviation in China and one of the leaders  in the world, but also keep up with the advanced levels in  flight training," said airline president Yin Wenlong.    "We already have a safety record of 39 years, and we have  the  determination to continue that record," he stressed.    Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua and the Canadian Ambassador Fred  Bild  were present at the signing ceremony.    The three most sophisticated simulators, confirmed by  Federal  Aviation Administration of U.S. as highest grade, will be set up  at Air China's new training centre near Beijing Capital Airport.    The 130,000-square-metre centre, under intense construction  since last August, will be the most advanced pilot training base  when it opens in July 1995.    This will enable Air China to train its pilots almost  exclusively at home, said an Air China training official.    Because the airline operates 63 jets -- led by 14 Boeing  747s, 8 767s and 19 737s -- it spends more than $1 million a  year sending pilots to the U.S., Australia and other countries  for training.    The imported simulators will foster pilot talent and slash  costs, the trainer said.    He said Air China, though boasting almost 1,000 pilots,  needs  to add nearly 60 pilots a year to meet growing demand for air  travel.    Other domestic carriers will be permitted to rent the  facilities for their pilots.    "CAE is very proud to supply the world's best flight  simulators to Air China, said Rusi Master, president of the  Canadian firm.    "The first and immediate benefit is to the users -- the  pilots," he continued. The second benefit would be to the  society as a whole by making air travel safety with good  training devices." [sentence as published]    The simulators can imitate all kinds of air conditions,  including different weather, helping train the pilots to cope  with emergencies.    "We sincerely hope that CAE and us will fully honour the  contract and make concerted efforts to make the world-class  Beijing Flight Training Centre a reality," said Yin Wenlong.    "That is a guarantee of our future fruitful co-operation and  a blessing for the health of civil aviation in China," he added.    Under the deal, the Canadian side is charged with  installment  and on-the-spot service of the simulators, the first of which  will be delivered in August 1995.    As the largest carrier in China, Air China runs 33  international routes and 57 domestic trunk routes, making  Beijing the centre of a transport web.</p>

			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Mining sale helps Dixon Motors Dixon Motors, the acquisitive dealership chain which moved up from the USM in June, saw pre-tax profit for the six months to June 30 increase from Pounds 642,000 to Pounds 3.37m, with a Pounds 2.44m exceptional contribution from discontinued mining operations. The group came to the USM last year after reversing into Plateau Mining; the exceptional resulted from the disposal of mining interests in Zimbabwe. As a result of the change in the nature of the business and a corresponding change in the year end, comparisons are from the pro forma accounts for the six months ended June 30 1993. Turnover increased by 55 per cent to Pounds 44.8m (Pounds 29m), with acquisitions contributing Pounds 364,000. Operating profit was ahead at Pounds 1.21m (Pounds 766,000); acquisitions contributed Pounds 61,000 against a Pounds 38,000 loss from discontinued operations last time. Earnings per share came to 25.7p (4.2p). The interim dividend is increased by 67 per cent to 1.25p (0.75p).</p>

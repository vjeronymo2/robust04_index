			<p><P> October 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MURKY WATER ISSUE NEEDS CLEARING  </P> <P> Old-style fears and jealousies are threatening to unravel a critical water  agreement that would benefit farmers in the Imperial Valley and urban dwellers  throughout Southern California. Both the Imperial Irrigation District and the  Metropolitan Water District of Southern California must realize that they have  too much to lose if their pact of nearly one year ago falls apart.  </P> <P> The 500,000-acre Imperial district is under order from the state to conserve  water. Metropolitan has agreed to pay $223 million to Imperial to construct the  needed conservation facilities. In return, Metropolitan would receive 100,000  acre-feet of the conserved water, which is part of California's apportionment  of Colorado River supplies.  </P> <P> A group of dissident farmers has raised new questions about the agreement,  including fears of liability for environmental damage that the program might  cause and the potential loss of control over their supplies to the giant urban  water agency. The farmers are pressuring the Imperial board of directors to  reopen negotiations with Metropolitan.  </P> <P> Another complication is that the Coachella Valley Water District, which draws  on the same Colorado sources, wants assurance that its rights will not be  impaired. The Metropolitan-Imperial deal expires Dec. 31 if the two agencies  fail to agree on implementation of the exchange.  </P> <P> The Imperial board will hold a special hearing on Friday to hear from the  dissident farmers and consider a proposal to safeguard Coachella's rights. The  Coachella board will meet next Tuesday and the Met board on Nov. 14. The  agencies should make every effort to settle their differences by the end of the  year or the issue could become embroiled in legal action that might ultimately  jeopardize everyone's claim on California's Colorado River supplies. This water  fight should be settled at the negotiating table, not at the bar.  </P></p>

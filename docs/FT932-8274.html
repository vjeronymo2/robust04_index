			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Tokyo dips 1.6 per cent on futures-led activity PERSISTENT futures sales sparked unwinding of arbitrage positions in the cash market, leaving equities 1.6 per cent lower in light trading, writes Wayne Aponte in Tokyo. The Nikkei average was down 336.12 at 20,229.39, after moving between a low of 20,155.10 and high of 20,502.46. The Topix index of all first section stocks lost 21.97 at 1,589.28, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 0.35 firmer at 1,223.69. First section volume came to 370m shares, up from Monday's 328m, while declines overwhelmed advances by 907 to 163, with 106 issues unchanged. Brokers said that, from the outset of trading, no major buyers were present in the market. Without buy orders from government-managed public funds, known to serve normally as a cushion for the Nikkei average on dips, equity prices might have declined further, brokers added. Increased futures activity is expected as investors attempt to protect themselves against further Nikkei declines in a market which provides scant incentives for inward investment. However, said brokers, many institutional investors, including life insurance companies, brokerages and Japanese corporations, were likely to enter the stock market more aggressively if the Nikkei trades below 20,000. An analyst at a UK stockbroker commented that investors are reacting favourably to any positive developments in sectors or individual issues. In spite of the day's declines, shipbuilding shares rose on a report about a major conference among Asian countries concerning tanker safety, which implied that new ships might be bought in the future. Equally, news of an increase in the percentage of dollar denominated contracts, which will help domestic operators in international bids, aided the sector. Mitsui Engineering and Shipbuilding rose Y4 to Y452, Hitachi Zosen Y10 to Y583 and Sasebo Heavy Y10 to Y558. Profit-taking cut the gains of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which relinquished Y22,000 to Y975,000. The weakness of that telecommunication group spread to electrical wire and cable issues. Sumitomo Electric Industries declined Y50 to Y1,130, Fujikura Y23 to Y997 and Furukawa Electric Y24 to Y687. Consumer electrical issues lost ground, Pioneer Electronic weakening Y160 to Y2,400, Sony Y70 to Y4,650 and TDK Y60 to Y3,840. The brokerage sector declined by about 2 per cent, Nomura slipping Y50 to Y2,110, Daiwa Y50 to Y1,260 and Nikko Y20 to Y1,040. In Osaka, the OSE average ended 275.76 lower at 22,552.98 in volume of 17m shares. Roundup THERE WERE fresh record highs in Hong Kong and Singapore. New Zealand was closed owing to technical problems. HONG KONG hit its new peak on optimism over Sino-British talks; negotiators from both sides are due to meet in Beijing on Friday for a further round of consultations. The Hang Seng index closed 25.18 higher at 7,149.30. Turnover was also a record - HKDollars 8.1bn against Monday's HKDollars 7.7bn. Performance of blue chips varied, brokers said. Cheung Kong was targeted by profit-takers and shed 40 cents to HKDollars 27.20. The most active stock, Hutchison Whampoa, dipped 10 cents to HKDollars 19.90. Market laggards such as China Light benefited from bargain hunting and the stock improved 50 cents to HKDollars 39. SINGAPORE rebounded strongly from Monday's profit-taking as the Straits Times Industrial index peaked 31.74 higher at 1,878.01 in volume of 365.6m shares. Brokers said demand for speculative Malaysian and second and third line Singapore stocks was strong. TAIWAN recovered from Monday's losses, with strong performances noted from Formosa Plastics, up TDollars 1.10 at TDollars 44.20, and China Steel, which appreciated 80 cents to TDollars 21.90. The weighted index improved 35.28 to 4,495.39. Turnover amounted to TDollars 23bn, against a previous TDollars 23.9bn. MANILA lost ground after opening higher with the aid of firm mining issues. The composite index dipped 19.90 to 1,596.14 in turnover down to 398m pesos from 555m. Philippine Long Distance Telephone receded 20 pesos to 970 pesos. AUSTRALIA fell at the close as investors reacted to weakness in the Australian dollar against the US currency. The All Ordinaries index shed 9.0 to 1,677.9 in turnover of ADollars 307.3m. In the banking sector, ANZ was steady at ADollars 3.55 after selling its 7 per cent stake in Challenge Bank for ADollars 2.48 a share. BANGKOK was lower following heavy losses among building materials companies. The SET index fell 8.62 to 872.96 in moderate turnover of Bt3.1bn.</p>

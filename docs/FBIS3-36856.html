			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Feb 08, BNS -- Estonia on Friday [4  February] initiated criminal proceedings against Pyotr Rozhok,  the representative of Russia's radical nationalist Liberal  Democratic Party in Estonia.    Charges were brought under Article 72 of the criminal code,  the minister of population, Peeter Olesk, said.    Olesk told a BNS correspondent that Rozhok now cannot be  deported from the country -- and that there is no reason to do  so -- before the case is brought to a conclusion.    The issue also stood on the agenda of today's meeting of the  Cabinet of Ministers. The Cabinet heard the opinion of Interior  Minister Heiki Arike on the issue.    The director general of the Defense Police, Juri Pihl, said  it was his department that had initiated the criminal case. "He  has not been arrested so far," Pihl said.    Rozhok in an interview with BNS at about 4 p.m. today said  he  knew nothing of the charges brought against him. He said he had  no contacts with the security police recently.    The representative of Zhirinovskiy's party in Estonia said  he  had no intention to leave the country. "But why?" he asked,  explaining that he is living on a territory that is Russia's  domain for ages.    Vasiliy Ostapchuk, adviser at the Russian Embassy in  Tallinn,  said Rozhok had not turned to the embassy for help. "If Rozhok  appeals to us for help, we can act under the consular convention  and the legal assistance agreement," he said.    The criminal code's Article 72 foresees punishments ranging  from fines to one year in prison for activity aimed at  instigating ethnic, racial or religious hostility.    Rozhok in his public statements on several occasions has  expressed views hostile toward Estonia. In an interview with  the SILLAMAESKI VESTNIK newspaper of the northeast Estonian town  of Sillamae last month he called on Russian army veterans to  form paramilitary units "for defending the (Russians') honor and  dignity" and again claimed Estonia was Russia's traditional  domain.    Rozhok is legally a citizen of Russia since May 28, 1992.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by President Borhanoddin Rabbani, marking second </F> anniversary of the Islamic revolution; place not given -- live  or recorded]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Faithful and free compatriots  of the country, heirs of the blood of martyrs and guards of the  Islamic revolution, brothers and sisters, peace and the  blessings of God be on you [preceding nine words spoken in  Arabic], and infinite praise to the nurturer of the universe who  helped the proud and infidel-crushing Afghan nation in their  bloody war and holy jihad to confront the aggressor and arrogant  red forces, which like a demon generated fear and terror in the  world, inflicting a defeat which opened a new chapter of  campaign and uprising in the history of the struggle of the  peace-loving and freedom-loving people.    Sawr 8th, which corresponds with the victory of the Islamic  revolution in our country, revives the memory of the great  resurrection of our nation and of more than 14 years of jihad  and liberation struggle by every compatriot. On this very day  two years ago the sound of God is Great [preceding three words  spoken in Arabic] echoed far and wide in this land of heroes and  the splendid flag of monotheism was unfurled. On this day the  mojahedin of Afghanistan and the entire warrior and believer  nation saw for themselves the fruit of jihad and the promise of  God, and our people were freed from the degrading communist  culture and from ideological and social degradation.    On this occasion I would like to present my cordial  congratulations to you, the free and heroic nation which  demonstrated steadfastness, fortitude, and resistance and which  eventually bravely achieved the victory of the Islamic  revolution. Sawr 8th opened a new chapter in the ancient history  of Afghanistan, and without doubt future generations across the  Islamic, free, independent, united, and unified Afghanistan will  celebrate this day as the dearest blood-price of the fighters on  the path of righteousness and monotheism with jubilation and  enthusiasm.    It is appropriate that on such a day we should mark the  second anniversary of our Islamic revolution, to honor the  victory of the revolution as the blood-price of the martyrs of  Islam and freedom in their tulip-colored shrouds and pray for  the souls of those brave free men of this land who raised the  flag of monotheism and guarded our independence and national  sovereignty with their pure blood. We pray that God will make  paradise their abode and residence.    There is no doubt that the Afghan jihad brought great  changes  in the world in the interest of peace and freedom. One result  of this is the independence of many countries who lived,  directly or indirectly, for many years under [word indistinct]  of the former Soviet Union. The international system of  communism as a base of [words indistinct] terror and colonialism  disappeared. The Berlin wall in the heart of Europe fell,  [words indistinct] and the period of the cold war ended, and a  new era of understanding among countries and continents began.    The 14-year jihad of the people of Afghanistan and its great  international impact, which is called [words indistinct] of the  century, cost our nation very dearly. With the victory of the  Islamic revolution the jihad leaders and the Islamic state  declared a general amnesty -- the greatest example of Islamic  and humanitarian forbearance and forgiveness. It was thereby  decided that clashes and hostilities -- created by looting  aliens and their uncultured servants -- were to be ended for  good and replaced with Islamic fraternity and cooperation.    As for the living standards of state employees, despite  budget restrictions the salaries of state employees have been  doubled and the overdue allowances of civil servants and other  state employees have been paid. It must be mentioned that  despite the fighting and its huge costs, the state has been able  to pay the salaries and other allowances of state employees up  to the month of Hamal 1373, and to pay about seven billion  afghanis to the families of the martyrs, the wounded, and those  whose property was damaged. Steps have been taken to eliminate  the atheist communist culture which was inculcated in certain  circles of our society under the atheist regime, and a program  of economic, social, and cultural policies of the Islamic state  has been initiated within the limits of high national interests  and lofty Islamic teachings.    In the international field, efforts have been made for the  country to emerge from diplomatic isolation and to enter a new  stage of constructive diplomacy in the interest of peace, the  reconstruction of the country, and relations [words indistinct]  with neighbors and all nations of the world.    Dear compatriots, the list of measures and achievements of  the Islamic State of Afghanistan would certainly have been much  longer but for treacherous conspiracies and ruinous battles  waged by the traitorous elements against the achievements of  jihad and the national interest. We mark this great victory at  a time when, unfortunately due to the power-seeking of known  groups and agents of the aliens, a bloody and ruinous war has  been imposed on our nation, especially on the oppressed  residents of Kabul. In this bloody hostility, the Islamic state  has no goal but defense of the oppressed people.    After the victory of the Islamic revolution no armed clash  inside the country has an Islamic and sharia basis. Yes, after  14 years of jihad and after enduring enormous hardships, the  people of Afghanistan were expecting that with the establishment  of the Islamic State an epoch of order, tranquillity, stability  and good intention and welfare would begin. They hoped that no  pain, and that too from the side of the jihadi ranks, would  threaten their individual and social life.    But because of the fiendish and opportunist forces,inside  and  abroad, who preferred their personal and group interest on the  interests of Islam and national interest and who could not bear  a powerful, united and developing Afghanistan in the heart of  the continent of Asia, as a foundation of freedom and justice,  embarked on sabotage and destruction. As a result of those  bloody conspiracies our material and morale forces, which should  have been employed for the reconstruction of the country and for  the repair of damages caused by the war, have been,  unfortunately, used for further destruction and the killing of  our defenseless and innocent compatriots.    Those hostile acts began as from the first days when state  power was handed over to mojahedin. When the gang-leaders of  this catastrophe [words indistinct], and sometimes under the  pretext of opposing the militia and sometimes opposition to some  heroic personalities of jihad fanned the flame of war of [word  indistinct] and fratricide. And thereby not only did they embark  on killing and destruction in the country but also made  questionable many years' prides of the mojahedin in and out of  the country. In pursuit of a peace-seeking policy and observing  the strategy of understanding and talks for the solution of  problems, the ISA [Islamic State of Afghanistan] entered  negotiations patiently and even ignored their organized  conspiracies for the sake of the high national interests and the  urgent realization of peace and security and resorted to the  solution of problems through peaceful means when the ruthless  warmongers embarked on chaos and destruction, and went anywhere  possible in search of peace. But the other side did not adhere  to any treaty and agreement.    Their last treacherous attempt, in the form of the 11th Jadi  [1 January] coup d'etat of the sinister triangle, occurred only  three days after the signing of an agreement which had been  initiated by the peace delegation of the cabinet.    The coup d'etat plan was executed on a day which  corresponded  the date of the establishment of the infamous Khalq party  [People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan]. In the incongruous  composition of the putschists, known atheists, national  traitors, and hypocrites have gathered in the form of a shameful  coalition against Islam and Islamic sovereignty and against the  people and the interests of the Afghan nation [37-second break  in reception]. When the [word indistinct] of the coup d'etat  were frustrated in their action, they embarked on retaliation  against the afflicted people of Afghanistan and the residents of  Kabul, and closed the road for the people whom they claim to be  ruling, embarked on the intensification of war and rocket  launching and the destruction of private and state property. It  had not been seen in the history of the world for the prime  minister of a country to commit such crimes against the  residents of his capital, and it has nowhere been seen for a  prime minister, who had been disappointed to seize power in a  monopolized manner, to announce if he did not accede to power in  a desired way, I would continue the killing of the defenseless  nation for another 25 years.    It is interesting that they call elections a solution, and  still think that they will be winners in elections, and expect  that the people of Afghanistan will vote the killers of their  children and the destroyers of their homes and those who  strangulate them every moment by the imposition of famine and  high prices of primary goods. The people have recognized their  enemies.    Dear compatriots, we are of the opinion that the principled  way of the solution of the current crisis of the country is the  creation of an effective electoral mechanism for the appointment  of the future leadership of Afghanistan. As in the past, war  cannot resolve the smallest of problems but it adds to the  hardship. In the opinion of the ISA, talks and understanding  for the cessation of war and bloodshed and for the joint search  for solution of the problems of the country are preferable and  have priority. Now the time of the rejection of the mojahed  forces and their upstaging in the process of determining the  fate of the country has passed. We should all jointly  participate in the cessation of the disputes in the high  interest of the country.    Our faithful and patriotic people are seriously in need of  peace and security. They should practically condemn these  warmongers, and should not allow any person or force to obstruct  the tranquillity of our people and the stability of the  situation. The homeland is the common home of all of us. All  son of this land, belonging to any nationality or tribe and  living in any part of the country and speaking any language, are  equally responsible before the country. The defense of its  independence and honors, effort and striving for its  construction and prosperity are of the common responsibility of  all residents of this land.    Defense of independence and its honor and work for the  country's reconstruction are the common duties and  responsibilities of all who live in this country. Another most  important duty of our people is to foil and repulse the  (?enemies) [words indistinct] who are causing sedition and  disorder in their own self-interests or on the instruction of  groups to whom they are attached. We believe that the faithful  and honest sons of this country are able to resolve and to end  the present crisis and any other crisis in their country without  foreign interference.    I believe that the people of Afghanistan themselves are  confident arbitrators and judges with the right and authority  regarding the national issues of Afghanistan. The people must  have the opportunity to use this right and to decide about their  homeland and its future, its political system, and its  organizational structure. Respecting the will of the people is  an Islamic command and an accepted international tradition.  Therefore, with regard to the solution of current problems, we  believe that a council [shura] representing the will of the  people should be set up. Whatever this council is called or  whatever name they give to it -- great council [loya jerga],  constituent council [shura-e hal wa aqd], grand council [grand  majlis], or any other name -- all nationalities, clans and  tribes, religious sects, and the country's various regions are  to have proportionate representation in this council.    A nongovernmental and competent commission named the  Preparatory Commission for the Formation of the Shura is to be  set up in order to prevent and to eliminate every possible kind  of pressure likely to be exerted on the work of this council or  to prevent any question about its work. This commission will be  tasked with preparing the draft for setting up this council and  determining the procedure for the election of council members  and candidates for the country's leadership. This commission  will have [word indistinct] executive authority and its expenses  are to be paid by the conference of foreign ministers of the  Islamic countries and the United Nations. These two  international organizations can supervise the work of setting up  this council. [words indistinct]    I call on the esteemed arbitrator delegation and all those  who are working for peace to take action as soon as possible to  set up this Shura. As soon as this work is completed I am ready  to hand over all power immediately to this council. I declare  clearly and earnestly to the brave people of Afghanistan that I  personally do not wish to shed even one drop of blood of our  persecuted people for whatever reason or objective. We have  already shown the necessary readiness, and in the future too we  are ready to take every beneficial action on this path. After  this council has been set up, as pointed out, state power will  be handed over. This council will elect the future leadership  in conformity with the will and wish of the entire people. The  council's decision must be respected by all.    It is my duty here to express appreciation for the work and  earnest endeavor of the peace delegations inside the country and  the esteemed ulema from the Islamic countries, as well as for  the work and efforts of the United Nations (?and the UN peace  delegation) led by esteemed M. Mestiri who have been working  very hard.    I hope that as a result of the efforts of the caring people  inside the country and the cooperation of the friendly and  neighborly countries and international organizations, especially  the OIC and UN, the current problem in our country be resolved  and peace and security be restored.    Pursuing the principle of positive nonalignment and  noninterference in the internal affairs of countries near and  far, the Islamic State of Afghanistan is loyal and interested in  the consolidation of peace and stability in the world and does  not interfere in the internal affairs of any country. The  Islamic State of Afghanistan is the serious supporter of  freedom, justice, and the observance of human rights, and  consider respectable and observable the Charter of UN, the  principles of Nonalignment Movement, and all international  conventions which are not against Islamic values. While  remembering with appreciation the support of the neighboring,  Islamic, and other peace-loving countries during the righteous  struggle of the people of Afghanistan, the Islamic State of  Afghanistan once again asks all those countries to render  sincere cooperation with our people in the process of the  ensuring peace and security and the reconstruction of the ruined  Afghanistan. Dear compatriots, congratulating you once again  on the second anniversary of the victory of the Islamic  revolution, I wish that almighty God makes the third year of the  victory of the Islamic revolution, in whose first days we are  now, a year of peace and calm and [words indistinct] in order  that we shall celebrate other anniversaries of this historic day  in an atmosphere of peace and fraternity across the Islamic,  independent, and free Afghanistan, God willing. Peace be upon  you.</p>

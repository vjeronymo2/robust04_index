			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, April 7 (AFP) -- French troops were put on  alert in Central African Republic on Thursday [7 April] after  the presidents of Rwanda and Burundi were killed in a plane  crash in Kigali, military officials said. The officials said  there were no plans at the moment to send troops into either  Rwanda or Burundi, where the situation was reported calm  Thursday although firing was reported in the Rwandan capital  Kigali. They added that French residents in both capital were  under no threat.    The Rwandan Defense Ministry said the plane, carrying the  officials back from a regional conference in Tanzania aimed at  settling ethnic strife in Rwanda and Burundi, had been shot down  by "unidentified elements" as it prepared to land late Wednesday.    The French officials said shots were fired Thursday morning  in Kigali but said there appeared to be no major disorder there.  Kigali residents as well as German and Belgian envoys there also  reported sporadic shooting in Kigali, while the German  ambassador there, Dieter Hoelscher, said the atmosphere there  was "tense."    The French source said French troops in Africa were put on  alert each time there was a crisis in a nearby country. Rwanda  and Burundi are located east of Zaire which neighbours Central  African Republic.    France pulled its last troops out of Kigali late last year  after UN forces were deployed there. About 10 French military  troops are in Burundi as part of an aid mission, the source  said. Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana and Burundi  President Cyprien Ntaryamira were killed along with government  aides, including two Burundi cabinet ministers, when their  aircraft crashed in Kigali late Wednesday.</p>

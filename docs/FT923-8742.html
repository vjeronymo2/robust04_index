			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / A definition of Richness: Kenneth Gooding talks to Marc Rich about departures at the trading group The departure of three very senior executives at the Marc Rich international trading organisation has prompted talk about a power struggle at the very top. Those who recently decided to quit one of the world's biggest oil traders and almost certainly the biggest metals and minerals trader, include: Mr Willy Strothotte, 47, widely perceived as the right-hand man and heir of Mr Marc Rich, chairman; Mr Claud Dauphin, head of the Rich organisation's oil trading operations, probably the biggest part of the business; Mr Manny Weiss, 40, managing director of Rich's London office and its formidable aluminium trading boss. These departures raise questions about whether the organisation, renowned for its aggressive approach to trading, might change its direction. Also, because trading relies so heavily on personal contacts and mutual trust, just how serious a blow is the removal of three main members from its corporate line-up? Some observers also wonder if the upheaval was caused by a big deal or deals going badly wrong, a common occurrence in the world of commodity trading. Mr Rich dismissed the idea of financial problems. He said the organisation had 'an annual turnover of Dollars 30bn (Pounds 15.7bn) and a net worth in excess of Dollars 1bn - and this after the departure over the last years of a number of senior people, even very senior people and founding partners. 'We reinvest profits and do not pay dividends so we have a capital base which is quite a bit higher than necessary for a trading business today. By reinvesting our profits we have had funds available to participate in certain industrial projects that support our trading business.' He says Rich's profitability remains strong. 'We do not publish our figures since we are a private company, but our profit in the last years has been good and this year, in spite of the more difficult economic climate, our results are good. We may make an occasional reserve, but our actual trading profit is very good. In general, we find our oil, metals and minerals and grain business growing and we hope that will continue.' Marc Rich was not a speculative organisation, he insisted. 'If our business was based on speculation we could take a hotel room with a few telephones and we would not need a worldwide organisation with 40 offices and 1,300 people in contact with consumers and producers and doing physical business every day.' Figures about the Swiss-based, privately-owned group are hard to come by, but Rich's UK company, reputed to be among the four most important in the organisation, reported a 1991 net profit of Dollars 13.8m, after Dollars 7.8m of tax, on a turnover of Dollars 2.67bn. Mr Rich has built up his group since 1974 after leaving Philipp Brothers, a large commodity trader, because of a dispute about his annual bonus. Today the Rich organisation is second only to Cargill, the US group, among the world's diversified trading houses. The group trades about 1.5m barrels a day of crude oil and petroleum products and about 2.5m tonnes of aluminium a year. Mr Rich's partner until recently was Mr Pincus 'Pinky' Green who left Philipp Brothers at the same time for the same reason. Mr Green and two more of Mr Rich's close colleagues - Mr Alex Hackel and Mr Felix Posen  - retired recently. Now three of the people who stepped into these gaps have also gone. Mr Rich saw no cause for concern. 'If one looks back at the history of our company, many people in very senior positions, partners and so on, have left. But, because from the very start we followed a policy of taking on young people and training them, there has always been a supply of people to take the place of whoever has departed and the company has gone from strength to strength.' As for the loss of personal contacts along with the departing executives, he said: 'In general our group has always worked in teams and therefore personal contacts which individuals have are generally shared with others in their group. This gives us greater strength. In other words, we feel a customer is best served if he has contact not only with one executive but with two or three. In this way the customer gets the benefit of different views. We try to do a good job for our customers and suppliers and also for our people.' Mr Rich went on to describe his own management approach: 'I have always worked as a member of a team and I like to delegate but, at the same time, on major decisions and special (financial) exposures, I have the final say.' There has been speculation among Rich's staff that Mr Strot-hotte, a German who had been with the group 15 years, left after losing a battle with Mr Rich for control of the group. Discussing the departures, Mr Rich said Mr Strothotte left 'because of difference in management approach with me. It was because of a philosophical difference in management and nothing else.' Mr Dauphin left to take over the family business in France after the death of his father. Mr Weiss, he pointed out, 'for some time has talked about spending more time with his family, doing charitable work and studies'. That will not stop rival traders guessing about the the 'philosophical disagreement' with Mr Strothotte or Mr Weiss's departure. Some suggest there might have been problems with the group's aluminium trade with Russia - it sends in alumina, the raw material, and takes out primary metal. Others point to the year-long dispute at Ravenswood Aluminium in the US where Mr Strothotte was president. This resulted in a United Steelworkers Union of America campaign which concentrated on the fact that Mr Rich faced tax evasion and other charges in the US dating back to 1984. That successful campaign had embarrassing international consequences for the Rich organisation. Mr Rich said: 'We did not like the strike which we ended earlier this year. The last thing in the world which our company wants is to be involved in labour disputes.' Mr Rich is known for his relentless drive and calculating mind. 'I guess I am a business machine, yet I have been doing this for 40 years. I believe I have the knack for it.' Yet he is now 58 and surely thinking about retirement. Not so. 'When my original partners retired two years ago the thought went through my mind should I retire as well. But it did not take me long to decide that I love the business and this is what I want to continue to do.'  --------------------------------------------------------------------- MARC RICH'S EMPIRE  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Headquarters:          Zug, Switzerland Turnover, 1991:        Dollars 30bn Net worth:             Dollars 1bn Employees              1,300 Shareholders:          200 Activities:            - world's largest metals and minerals trader                        - one of world's largest oil traders                        - sixth largest aluminium producer Main trading centres:  Stamford, Conneticut                        Tokyo                        London                        Zug                        Rotterdam                        Madrid  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

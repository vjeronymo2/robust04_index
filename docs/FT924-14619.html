			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / International Company News: SKF to sell CTT stake to Sandvik Cormorant SKF, the Swedish roller bearing group, has reached preliminary agreement to sell an 80 per cent stake in CTT Tools, the world's leading supplier of high-speed steel cutting tools, to Sandvik Coromant. Terms for the deal have not been finalised, but analysts suggest CTT as a whole is worth around SKr1.2bn (Dollars 220m). The acquisition would complement Sandvik Cormorant's operations in cemented carbide tools, giving the group an estimated 13 per cent share of the cutting tools market. Mr Clas Ake Hedstroem, Sandvik Cormorant president, said the acquisition would allow the group to offer clients a broader product range and achieve physical distribution synergies. Sandvik may also seek to buy the minority 20 per cent stake in CTT held by Germany's Guenther, although discussions have not started. SKF said it was seeking to sell its CTT stake because it wanted to concentrate on its core roller bearing activities. But analysts also suggest the group's balance sheet is under pressure following its purchase of the special steels company Ovako. Long-term loans climbed to SKr5.6bn at June 30 from SKr4.4bn at the start of the year. Frankfurt-based CTT has 3,900 employees, with operations spread across 24 companies in 11 countries. It manufactures and markets cutting tools such as twist drills, taps, dies and milling tools. Last year, CTT achieved sales of SKr1.9bn and had a loss after financial items of SKr103m. In the first half, the operation incurred a SKr30m loss. Sandvik Cormorant, part of the Sandvik Group, achieved sales of SKr4.9bn last year.</p>

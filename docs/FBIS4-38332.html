			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" report No. 21 of 71] </F>   [Text] According to analysts, the treaty signed between the  Russian federal government and Tatarstan on the separation of  powers has not offered Tatarstan the expected economic  prosperity. Moreover, there are signs of a political crisis in  the republic as relations are worsening between the executive  and legislative branches of power. These questions were the  subject of an Interfax interview with the Vice-President of  Tatarstan VASILIY LIKHACHYOV.    INTERFAX: Having signed the treaty with Russia Kazan  resolved its political problems: The new status of Tatarstan  was recognized. But today the republic is facing domestic  problems which are no less grave. More and more often  politicians speak of a critical state of the Tatar economy,  politics and ideology. What is your personal opinion of the  situation?    LIKHACHYOV: During the past few years the Tatar leadership  has been quite energetically working on its strong  socio-political potential. Its legal status is evident now. It  has been formulated. But it so happened that political and  legal developments went ahead of economic. This is objective  reality. We had to carry out the tasks put forward in the  declaration of sovereignty and in the new constitution of  Tatarstan.    The republic, now a truly sovereign state, is facing a  number  of contradictions some of which are quite deep.    First of all, the legislative and executive branches of  power  worked together without conflicts toward a common objective:  sovereignty and its recognition by Moscow. It is evident that  the responsibility for the current situation in the republic,  for the mistakes and shortcomings lie equally on the president,  his staff, parliament and government. But they also should work  together to overcome the crisis. Unfortunately, not all power  structures are ready for such joint work and for reforming  themselves. Under the constitution both the parliament and the  government have supervising powers. It is incorrect, to say the  least, for parliament to try to act separately. I would say it  is politically wrong.    Besides, after signing the treaty with Tatarstan the system  of values is naturally and logically changing. Everyone was  convinced that political achievements should open up broad  prospects for economic reforms. But they should have been  carried out with reliance on local resources which proved to be  difficult. A financial, economic and technological collapse  followed.    On the other hand, we somewhat underestimated the high  degree  of Tatarstan's integration in the Russian economy. The weakness  of our stance I think was that it was not comprehensive. Today  the Tatar leadership is giving up the illusion that when a high  rise building is on fire one can survive by closing one's own  door.    Tatarstan can hardly work out any independent original  program of overcoming the crisis: we are in a common economic  space with Russia, therefore federal processes should be taken  into account. Speaking of a crisis one should bear in mind that  the whole of the Russian Federation, Tatarstan being part of it,  is facing political and economic difficulties. Besides, it is  evident to me that the anti-crisis program now in the making  might not work, if the approach to the selection of top  officials is not changed.    INTERFAX: Some analysts claim that a power crisis is moving  on Tatarstan. Do you think the mutual accusations of parliament  and government might develop into a more serious conflict that  can end with the resignation of someone from the top echelon?    LIKHACHYOV: Having resolved several important political  questions the Tatar leadership unfortunately fell into euphoria  taking the period of stabilization for actual reforms. However,  the question of deep economic changes and the development of  projects was never raised. It turned out that the political  prerequisites for reforms were wonderful, but there was no  noticeable advancement of economic thinking.    Now in typically Russian traditions the republic has started  looking for a scapegoat. Important matters were resolved better  or worse during the stabilization period. It is a different  matter that new versions of advancement should have been sought  simultaneously. But is the government alone to blame for what  did not happen?    I would like to reiterate that the necessity of serious  changes in all spheres, including appointments, is evident. One  must face the truth. I think that many leaders, some quite  high-ranking, should resign. But the process is always very  painful and accompanied by personal tragedies. I think that a  person should first of all realize one's own potential. If one  feels having exhausted it and become only a professional  instrument in the hands of others, he must resign.    INTERFAX: In Tatarstan unlike many other parts of the  Russian Federation the political elite did not change. Analysts  say the party elite is actually still in power at all levels.  Probably the stabilization period, as you called, it had its  favorable effect allowing to keep the republic controllable and  prevent a total collapse of the economy. But will President  Mintimer Shaymiyev agree to radical changes in his staff? After  all it was he who formed this team.    LIKHACHYOV: Mintimer Shaymiyev will never become a hostage  of his own associates. Today we can say that there are no  so-called grey cardinals who could resolve their own problems  behind his back. On the whole the administration reacts to  changes in the situation quite adequately.    The elite is not homogeneous at all. Many old regional party  leaders in the new conditions have found their own niche. But  now it turns out that some of them clearly lack training. And  that is first of all a personal crisis.    Besides, the administration itself is far from being  perfect.  On the one hand, it is highly responsible and disciplined, on  the other, negative tendencies have appeared: territorial  groups, regional lobbies.    The change should begin with the presidential team. I see  the way out in the appearance of striking, dynamic , unbiased  persons. Shaymiyev is now facing a most difficult task because  the constitutional provision that he is a guarantor of rights  and liberties, a guarantor of stability requires a new  interpretation.    The Tatar economy can no longer be based on oil dollars and  the Tatar leadership must realize the new standard of tasks  facing the country. This requires the interference of the  president and his closest circle that should change in an  evolutionary as well as revolutionary manner. I think the  management should be more democratic and open in its work.    I know that the criminal world has started approaching  certain government structures. In my opinion the time is ripe  to set up a Security Council of Tatarstan. The republic needs a  normal policy of choosing and appointing officials that would  not be carried out by certain half-hidden persons. It should be  an open policy covering the entire government mechanism,  guaranteeing the change of generations in the Leadership and  respect for those who are resigning.    INTERFAX: The media claim that President Shaymiyev might  find himself in a similar situation with Boris Yeltsin who in  their opinion has successfully resolved Russia's foreign  problems but fails in resolving domestic ones.    LIKHACHYOV: I remain an optimist in this respect. I think  that President Shaymiyev has the necessary willpower, energy,  possibilities and potential.</p>

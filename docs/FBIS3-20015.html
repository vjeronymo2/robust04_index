But I wonder, disregarding official  reactions, how the event has been received by the public in the  countries of the East, which have been knocking on Brussels'  door for some time. Will they perceive in it the raising of  another barrier and a reaffirmation of the old divisions of the  continent? Will they perceive in this enlargement to new  members yet another reaffirmation of their status as  second-class Europeans?    When the struggle between the east and west blocs ended,  many  predicted that the partitioning of the old Europe into two  political areas would end soon, too. Unfortunately, anyone who  follows the affairs of these countries, known until recently as  the Iron Curtain countries, must now acknowledge that this  prediction, if not groundless, was at least premature. In  practice the division remains, and is perhaps growing sharper.  Just as though, where once there stood the barbed wire and  watchtowers of the so-called Iron Curtain, there is still an  intangible but real barrier. In so saying, I am referring not  only to the economic and commercial factors that are slowing and  complicating the negotiations for some of these countries' full  European Union membership. Nor do I want for the moment to talk  about the prospects facing the major country of the East, that  is, Russia, which now seems more uncertain than ever before.    Let us keep to the part of central East Europe that is  closest to us and that we could therefore have expected to be  within closer reach of the membership process. However, some  problem signs have been emerging from there recently. They tell  us that, despite everything, the two Europes remain distant, in  spite of the hopes. They are political events that reveal the  difficulty still being encountered by their governments' process  of integration into the West European outlook and therefore  suggest dangers of their lapse back toward more or less grim  solutions.    Let us consider, first, the case of Hungary, that is, the  country that in many respects seemed one of the most "ready" and  best suited to inclusion in the West European circle. Recently  several dozen journalists were dismissed by the state radio and  television service without any explanation other than that their  attitude was inconsistent with the government's. There is no  doubt that Hungary is having to deal with some serious problems  of conversion, including that of an inflation rate which is much  higher than those of its the western counterparts and the need  for foreign investments. We must also give credit to the  successive governments since the collapse of communism for  having curbed the internal radical nationalist tendencies,  traditionally strong among a people who believe that they have  always been sacrificed -- to a world conspiracy, on the subject  of borders. Nevertheless, it is a bad sign, or at least a sign  of precariousness, when a government takes issue with the  representatives of the media.    Another warning has come from Slovakia. We must remember  that when that country decided about three years ago to separate  from Prague, there were some people in our country who regretted  the fact, recalling that a similar separation took place in the  Hitler era. But there were also some, starting with the League  and other irresponsible people, who celebrated the event. The  fact is that Slovakia is now in the midst of a political and  economic storm. Its backwardness with respect to the  neighboring Czech Republic is obvious, but the political  repercussions are even more serious. Its leader, Vladimir  Meciar, the former communist who donned a new nationalist guise  and who promoted the split, has in turn been disowned by his  supporters and forced to resign, so all the signs are that a  period of turbulence and dangers has begun for this Eastern  republic, too.    The situation with which Romania is grappling seems even  more  serious. When Ceausescu was brought down, for some days the  whole world followed anxiously, live on television, what  appeared to be a people's revolution. But how much news  coverage is devoted now to events in Romania? The fact is that  some sad things are happening in that country. The 1989 revolt  is increasingly emerging as a mere palace coup planned and  carried out within a single ruling class. Romania's economic  situation has not made any decisive progress even from the dark  days of the Conducator, with inflation running at around 200  percent. Under these circumstances the two demagogic  nationalist parties -- the PUNR [Romanian National Unity Party]  and the PRM [Great Romania Party] -- are able to dictate their  own terms, influencing the government with the threat of  stirring up the people over the issues of nationality. Thus,  after a brief pause during which it attracted the world's  attention, Romania seems to have lapsed back into its Balkan  oblivion.    We have left until last the recent good news about the  conclusion of an agreement on Bosnia between Croats and Muslims  for the formation of a federal republic. But will this be the  much hoped-for turning point? Will it spell the end of the  latest Balkan bloodbath? It is justifiable to express  skepticism. It may be doubted that a diplomatic operation  carried out in private far from the battlefields can actually  disarm the opposing sides, can bury traditional rancors and  hatreds revived in recent years by massacres of one home after  another, one family after another. All the more, since there  are still many unresolved issues. For instance, how can  Slovenia and Croatia aspire to join the family of European  peoples if they cannot even succeed in resolving their own  modest dispute?    To conclude: The enlargement of Europe to the north (Sweden,  Finland, Norway) and to the center (Austria) takes Europe to its  furthest possible extent. But at the same time, it underlines  the enduring division between the two Europes. It will take  time before the other Europe frees itself from its old plagues,  which are now revealing themselves in returns to  authoritarianism and eruptions of nationalism.</p>

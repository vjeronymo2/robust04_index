			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report COFFEE prices continued the uptrend of the past few days but dealers said trading remained thin. The November futures position finally broke through resistance at Dollars 750 a tonne to closed at Dollars 757 a tonne, up Dollars 17 on the day and Dollars 34 on the week so far. Dealers were cautious about the prospects for the rise being sustained, however, suggesting that further gains would bring out the sellers. COCOA prices reversed the recent rise, ending at the bottom of the day's range in London. December futures closed at Pounds 636 a tonne, down Pounds 18. Dealers said the recent buoyant mood seemed to be evaporating in London, and the New York market provided little support. 'It's a bit disappointing,' said one trader. 'We had a gap to fill between Dollars 642 and Dollars 648 in near December and now we've closed below that, which could mean more losses in the near term.' At the London Metal Exchange NICKEL prices staged a late surge. Dealers were not getting too excited, however, arguing that the market was unlikely to build on the day's Dollars 54 rise to Dollars 7,340.50 a tonne for three months metal unless today's LME report showed a reversal of the recent strong uptrend in nickel stocks.

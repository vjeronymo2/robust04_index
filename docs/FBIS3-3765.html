Mao Fengping, a ministry official, said here today that  there  were more than 1.52 million journeys to 189 countries and  regions. Most voyagers were from China's coastal areas. Some  may have made more than one visit abroad.    He said the number of people who applied to travel for  private purposes got official approval and actually made the  trip was a record.    He attributed the boom to the simplified system of passport  processing, especially for scientists, technicians and students.

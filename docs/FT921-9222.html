			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / International Company News: Japanese camera-makers fear further patent action LEADING Japanese camera-makers are anxiously awaiting contact from Honeywell, the US controls manufacturer awarded Dollars 96m last week by a US jury for alleged violation of its autofocus technology patents by Minolta of Japan. Japanese industry officials said yesterday they were aware that Honeywell had stated an intention to pursue actions against 15 other camera equipment manufacturers, including Canon, Nikon, and Fuji Photo Film, which the US company alleges have also infringed on the patents. The Japanese makers said they did not plan to halt exports to the US, in spite of Honeywell's plans to attempt to ban Minolta from marketing in the US any cameras containing the autofocus technology. While the timing of the court's decision was seen by some Japanese as linked to the recent increase in US-Japan trade tension, the camera makers said the long-running dispute with Honeywell involved a more fundamental principle of patent rights. 'If a man invents an electric fan with three blades, does he also have a patent on a fan with five blades?,' asked an official from Minolta, which was relieved that the US jury dismissed a charge that it had wilfully violated the patents. Japanese makers, who are already being squeezed by sluggish camera sales, generally argue that they developed their own technology, in spite of an 'advanced disclosure agreement' that some of these companies entered into with Honeywell in the 1970s. Ricoh, the office equipment and optical goods maker, said the issue was 'very technical', and it expected that Honeywell would need a long period to prepare a claim which took into account the differences in equipment produced by the various Japanese companies. Canon said: 'We don't think we have been infringing, but we will take the necessary action if Honeywell contacts us.' Asahi Optical, the maker of Pentax cameras, said the company was gathering information in expectation of contact from Honeywell. The size of the award surprised several companies, though the industry generally was relieved that the US jury did not find Minolta guilty of wilful violation. Minolta had reckoned that such a finding could have cost it as much as Dollars 500m, a heavy burden for a company that last October reported its first interim loss for 25 years.</p>

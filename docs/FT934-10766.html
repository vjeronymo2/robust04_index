			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Brussels urges agreement on steel THE European Commission still hopes to rush through proposals on the restructuring of the Community's state-owned steelmakers in time for formal approval by EC industry ministers in two weeks. Senior Commission officials yesterday welcomed 'positive new elements' in the Treuhand privatisation agency's plans for the sale of Ekostahl, the east German steelmaker. They said they believed an acceptable deal could also be struck with the Italian authorities on the restructuring of Ilva, the loss-making producer. But national officials believe that there may not be enough time to sort out member states' remaining objections to the Commission's proposals and push for unanimous approval of the Italian, German and Spanish steel restructuring at the November 18 meeting. Delaying a decision until December would further punish the EC steel industry, which is groaning under the burden of overcapacity, slackening demand and alleged unfair competition from outside the Community. Wider EC plans to cut capacity and support the steel producers cannot take effect until decisions have been made on the restructuring of publicly owned steelmakers in east Germany, Italy and Spain. The Commission had originally hoped to agree an overall plan for capacity cuts, financial and commercial support, by the summer. A senior Commission official said yesterday: 'We can't possibly postpone this council (of ministers): either they come to a miraculous agreement (on November 18), or we will have a very direct and dramatic exchange of views which hopefully will clarify the situation and at least pave the way for a final agreement.' Both the German and Italian authorities are expected to submit formal plans to the Commission for the restructuring of their problem steel producers in the next few days. According to Treuhand plans unveiled two days ago, Riva, the private Italian steel group, is expected to buy 60 per cent of Ekostahl, and invest in the construction of a new hot-rolling mill. Brussels officials said yesterday they would have to examine whether there was sufficient private investment in the hot-rolling mill to avoid adding to problems with overcapacity. Private steelmakers will not make the painful closures that Brussels believes are required to restore the EC industry to health unless they are sure competition is not being distorted by subsidies. Ilva, meanwhile, has formally approved a plan to divide itself into three separate operations, seen as a vital precursor to privatisation, or, in some cases, closure. The three operations cover the group's big flat products operation, based at Taranto in southern Italy; stainless steels, based at Terni in Umbria. The third company incorporates all those activities and assets due to be liquidated, along with a majority stake in the quoted Dalmine tubes group, which is set to be privatised. Commission officials said yesterday they were heartened by the privatisation proposals contained in the Ekostahl plan. To avoid accusations that the German authorities are covertly subsidising new capacity, German officials indicated yesterday that a separate legal entity, owned by Riva, may be set up to build the new hot-rolling mill at Ekostahl. Riva, one of Italy's leading private steelmakers, is still family-owned, is based in Milan and has most of its productive capacity in northern Italy.</p>

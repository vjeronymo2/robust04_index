			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / A continent discovered: Martin Wolf and Tony Walker ask whether the government can stay on the Chinese economic tiger The opening of China to the world is,' argues Prof Tong Dalin, vice-chairman of the Chinese Society for Research on Restructuring the Economic System, 'like the discovery of a new continent.' If anything, Prof Tong understates his case. Were China to replicate the performance of other Asian 'miracle' economies, such as Japan, Taiwan and South Korea, its impact would be overwhelming. China does, after all, contain 10 times as many people as Japan. According to official statistics, the economy is already well on the way. Real gross domestic product expanded by 270 per cent between 1978 and 1993 - a compound annual rate of 9 per cent a year. In 1992 and 1993, economic growth exceeded 13 per cent. This year, supposedly time for a slow-down, it is expected to be above 11 per cent. There are reasons to believe these figures exaggerate China's performance. If, for example, the reported growth rate is worked backwards from the World Bank's estimate for GDP per head of Dollars 470 in 1992, it becomes just Dollars 195 in 1980 (in 1992 dollars). This is below the rather more reliable estimates of India's GDP per head in that year, which is quite unlikely. Chinese statistics are not entirely reliable. Under-estimation of inflation is, for example, a well-known problem. More significant are the problems created by its still semi-reformed economy. Even in 1992, almost half of the industrial output was generated by the state-owned enterprises (SOEs), while more than 61 per cent of total fixed investment (23 per cent of GDP) was buried within them (see chart). Given the low cost of official finance, the virtual absence of bankruptcy, and continued distortions in relative prices, part of this investment is likely to have been wasted. At least some of the associated increases in output could also be illusory, as turned out to be the case for the vaunted growth of the former Soviet-bloc economies. Nevertheless, China does have solid and measurable achievements. The country's share of world merchandise trade rose from 0.6 per cent in 1977 to 2.5 per cent in 1993, by when it had become the world's 11th largest exporter. Foreign direct investment in 1993 was Dollars 21.3bn, more than a third of total FDI in all developing countries in that year. Gross national savings reached 40 per cent of GDP in 1993 (which can be contrasted with the 15 per cent attained in the wealthier US). Such a high rate of capital formation virtually ensures rapid growth, even if some is wasted. Moreover, consumption has been growing at a compound rate of close to 8 per cent a year since 1978. Non-state enterprises (including so-called township and village enterprises) now employ some 100m workers. Moreover, most Chinese provinces - not just those on the coast, like Guangdon and Fujian - have achieved substantial increases in real incomes. These achievements are not a miracle. As developments elsewhere in Asia show, they are the natural result of releasing the pent-up energies of the world's largest reservoir of motivated people, combined with the capital and know-how of overseas Chinese and other foreigners. There is no economic reason why a country whose real output per head lies somewhere between 5 and 10 per cent of that of the US should not be able to sustain economic growth at 10 per cent a year for a quarter of a century. Yet there may still be a reason for failure. For what is amazing is not that China is at last becoming richer, but that it is still so poor. Politics kept China poor. It could do so once more. The reasons for this dismal performance were the country's inability to combine a reasonable degree of political stability with encouragement of productive (as opposed to rent-seeking) economic initiative. Under the influence of Deng Xiaoping's 'socialism with Chinese characteristics', this combination has at last been achieved. The big question is whether it will survive his death. Optimists argue that progress is assured merely by continuing with past policies. In the most brilliant example of the indirect approach in economic history, Chinese policy-makers have simply gone round the obstacles created by the legacy of communism. They started by granting freedoms to peasant farming, while political decentralisation encouraged local governments to compete with one another for investment. The overseas Chinese and foreigners were invited into special economic zones and, increasingly, to form joint-ventures with Chinese enterprises. State-enterprises have been subjected to competition from without, rather than radical reform from within. More recently, financial markets have also been created. The ruling assumption is that China has now reached a virtuous circle of growth. Economic success engenders both further reform and popular toleration of the regime. It also makes a return to the old ideologies impossible. As Mr Zhang Junkuo, senior research fellow of the Development Research Centre of the State Council, remarks: 'The target itself is changing all the time.' The extent to which targets have changed was revealed in the 14th congress of the Communist party of October 1992, which officially endorsed the idea of a 'socialist market economy'. This was followed by the Third Plenum of 1993, whose '50 articles' laid out an ambitious programme of further reform. The document established the principles of central government primacy, necessary for fiscal and monetary discipline; of a rule-based market economy, with uniform laws, rather than one based on bargaining; and of the reform of property rights within SOEs. Above all, it established a comprehensive blueprint for the transition to a market economy. It goes well beyond 'groping for stones to cross a river', the original motto of reform. The success of incrementalism has encouraged reformers to be bolder and more systematic in what they are attempting to do. Unfortunately, the benign view of Chinese prospects - in which ever more rigorous and decisive approaches to reform are built upon the successes of previous more tentative ones - is persuasive, rather than cogent. Past reform has not just thrown up successes on which to build. It has also erected significant obstacles. Among the most important is the effect on political and social stability. The most immediate threats include official corruption, unrest among unemployed workers, the migration of a vast army of indigent peasants in search of work and a widening gap between rich and poor. The necessity to establish affordable social security arrangements, after the break-down of the old cradle-to-grave education, employment, health and welfare system based on work units is another daunting challenge. Central control is also being tested by increasingly powerful provincial officials, especially those from wealthy coastal provinces, whose economic success has enabled them to carve out personal fiefdoms allowing them, on occasions, to challenge or even ignore Beijing's dictates. The fruits of economic success are the only possible basis for political stability in a country that has turned its back on communist ideology. But they are also the source of destabilising political and social developments. Budget deficits, incontinent monetary expansion and inflation are the economic evidence for these various political stresses. They bubble to the surface, like lava, where the tectonic plates of fragile central authority, provincial autonomy and SOE uncompetitiveness clash. They also have the capacity to engulf even the most vigorous fruits of economic reform. As William Overholt says in his important book on China's prospects: 'Failure to mobilise sufficient revenue through tax reform has historically been a key reason for the downfall of China's regimes; it was a fatal flaw of the Qing dynasty'.(1) It has now become a grave danger to the regime's stability. Following earlier reform, revenue from SOEs has fallen from 20 per cent of GDP in 1978 to only 4 per cent in 1992. This decline accounted for 80 per cent of the fall in the share of budgetary revenue in GDP, from 34.4 per cent to a mere 15.4 per cent. Until reforms introduced this year, revenue has also been collected by local government, leaving central government starved: the central government's share in budgetary revenue shrank from 59 to 41 per cent, though its share in spending fell only from 46 to 41 per cent. Central government has lost the capacity to transfer income from the wealthier and more dynamic coastal parts of China to the less dynamic hinterland. More significantly, it has turned in a big way to direct and indirect borrowing from the central bank, the People's Bank of China. The chart shows how far it has gone, on the assumption that 80 per cent of the lending by the PBC to the financial system is, in fact, government-directed lending and so indirect public spending. It also shows how rapidly the consolidated deficit itself has been rising. In 1993 it was more than half as large as total budgetary revenues. Seignorage - revenue derived from the government's access to the central bank via monetary expansion - seems to have varied from 6 to 9 per cent of Chinese GDP between 1988 and 1992, an extraordinary figure by international standards. In 1992, for example, seignorage from reserve money creation amounted to just under 40 per cent of total budgetary revenues, while direct and indirect government borrowing from the PBC amounted to just under 30 per cent. The Chinese government is addicted to the printing press because pressures for spending are growing stronger, while its revenue base is so weak. Pressures for public spending increase as SOEs come under growing competitive pressure: almost half of them appear to be making losses this year, even though the economy is forecast to expand by more than 11 per cent. It is horrifying to consider what would happen in a real recession. It is almost impossible to exaggerate the significance of the monetary financing. Hitherto the Chinese people have willingly held ever more money, partly because of the lack of alternatives (see chart). Given the degree of monetisation of the economy - much higher than in other economies at comparable levels of development - flight from money would cause a devastating inflation. The danger is real - and the urgency of decisive action underplayed even among the more economically educated policy-makers. The big question is whether decisive action is politically possible. Reform of state enterprises, creation of a social security system, making a success of the new fiscal system, reform of the central bank are all extremely urgent if economic - and so political - stability are to be secured. Is the Communist party, divided and weak, the instrument to deliver urgent action? If not, there is no alternative. Senior Chinese believe that the party will survive this difficult period, provided living standards continue to improve at a fairly rapid rate. Dong Fureng, a member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, China's parliament, says: 'Politically I don't see fundamental change in the next 10 years. The Communist party will still be controlling the country with the proviso that it keeps its hands clean.' Critics would say that the party has failed in this regard and that corruption is pandemic. But Mr Dong, who is also a professor emeritus of China's Academy of Social Sciences, believes that in spite of resistance, the Chinese system is capable of transformation. 'We will have to change,' he says. 'We will have to become more democratic and that means increasing the powers of representative institutions like the National People's Congress.' Chinese officials insist that their mission is to avoid repetition of Soviet-style turmoil, on the grounds that China, with its huge, unwieldy population, simply could not sustain such disruption. Memories of the chaos of the Cultural Revolution continue to weigh heavily. Their dilemma, however, is that slow and steady change, which they prefer and which would avoid upsetting powerful interests in society, may itself be disruptive. The authorities have to stabilise the shaky public finances and monetary system now. But they must also not halt economic progress, or awake overwhelming opposition. If they get the balance right, they should be able to ride the tiger of super-charged economic growth for years. China itself would then become more middle-class, more democratic and more open, while the Communist party would have to change out of recognition. If they fail, the inadequacy of the rulers will, again, have short-changed the long-suffering Chinese people.

			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Basis for manufacturing's pleas survives intact Sir, Peter Robinson (Letters, October 11) errs in appearing to equate fixed investment in plant and equipment (p and e) with manufacturing investment in p and e. In fact, manufacturing now only accounts for 28.5 per cent of total p and e investment in the UK economy, down from 48 per cent in the early 1960s; the services, broadly defined to include internationally exposed and sheltered segments, account for the majority of economy-wide p and e investment. UK manufacturing's miserable record in p and e investment can be gauged from the fact it now accounts for just 1.6 per cent of gross domestic product - against 3.2 per cent in the early 1960s. In absolute terms, UK manufacturing's p and e investment is no higher (at constant prices) than 20 years ago, but then output is no higher either. The UK's comparative investment record internationally can best be gauged from the following data of the share of total manufacturing investment as a percentage of gross domestic product (averages for 1980-1992): UK: 2.1 per cent; Germany: 3.1 per cent; France: 3.2 per cent; Italy: 4 per cent. Quite why UK manufacturing stagnates despite the recent sharp recovery in profits remains a mystery. But the statistical basis for the industrial associations' pleas for fiscal incentives survives Peter Robinson's strictures intact.

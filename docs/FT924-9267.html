			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Trachtenberg case curbs lifted: Former Maxwell financial adviser charged with failing to answer SFO questions THE High Court yesterday lifted reporting restrictions on the hearing of an extra charge against Mr Larry Trachtenberg, former financial adviser to Robert Maxwell. Mr Trachtenberg, it can now be reported, has been accused of failing to answer questions put to him by the Serious Fraud Office under section two of the Criminal Justice Act which empowers it to remove the right to silence. The hearing began two weeks ago at Clerkenwell Magistrates Court in London. The lifting of restrictions follows a succession of court battles between Mr Trachtenberg, charged with theft and fraud over the Maxwell affair, and newspapers including the Financial Times. Mr Trachtenberg had argued unsuccessfully that reporting of the case would prejudice his main trial, on the theft and fraud charges. The trial is due to start in early 1994, when he will appear in the dock alongside Robert Maxwell's two youngest sons, Mr Kevin Maxwell and Mr Ian Maxwell, and Mr Robert Bunn. During Mr Trachtenberg's appearance at Clerkenwell, Mr Bill Waite, an SFO lawyer investigating the Maxwell affair, said substantial assets appeared to have been misused. But he went on: 'I am not sure you can say with any certainty that there has been financial gain by any of the parties under investigation.' He also said that more charges were expected to be brought against Mr Trachtenberg before his trial. The six theft and fraud charges currently against him are only 'sample' charges. Soon after his arrest in June, Mr Trachtenberg was served with a section two notice by the SFO, compelling him to answer investigators' questions, the court heard. Mr Trachtenberg attended a meeting but, having taken legal advice, refused to answer key questions. He denied breaking the law, claiming it allowed people with a 'reasonable excuse' not to answer questions and that he had such a reasonable excuse. The issues on which Mr Trachtenberg refused to answer questions included: His personal assets outside the UK including a Swiss Bank account and a Jersey trust account. The previous owner of his London house. How he first met Robert Maxwell. His role as commercial director within the Robert Maxwell Group. The purpose of London and Bishopsgate Holdings, a company within the Maxwell empire, of which he was a director. The purpose of First Tokyo Trust, of which he was the company secretary. Liechtenstein stiftungs (foundations) related to Robert Maxwell and his family. The Maxwell foundation and movement of assets to it. Mr Trachtenberg told the SFO that it was unreasonable for him to be interviewed after he had been charged and when he was expecting more charges to be brought against him. The SFO would be requiring him to present his defence before it had assembled its case. This shifted the burden of proof from prosecution to defendant, he argued. He told his interviewers: 'It is my belief that the SFO would be motivated by the desire to obtain information to help convict me.' Mr Alan Suckling QC, for the SFO, told the court that carrying out interviews under section two after a person had been charged was within the law. A recent test case in the House of Lords, that of Mr Wallace Duncan Smith, had ruled that this was within the SFO's powers. Mr Waite, who had tried to interview Mr Trachtenberg, said the SFO's intention had been to obtain information relating to its general investigation into the Maxwell affair, not just Mr Trachtenberg's involvement. Mr Trachtenberg had not been interviewed before his arrest, but the SFO had enough evidence to justify charging him, he argued. He told the court that there were significant differences between his case and that of Mr Smith. The case continues today.</p>

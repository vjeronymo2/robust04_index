			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, April 21 (BTA) -- Prime Minister Lyuben  Berov today told a radio interviewer he is capable to work and  will be back to his duties on Monday [25 April]. "I will be  back (to work) on Monday and will not spare anyone," Prof. Berov  said. He is planning to address parliament next week.    The prime minister is still in hospital recovering after a  quadruple bypass surgery in March and an infectious disease  alarm on April 13. During his stay at the hospital the prime  minister held consultations on an upcoming cabinet overhaul.  Asked whether he expects a consensus on the cabinet changes,  Prof. Berov said: "When a man has a goal, he will attain it."    In the meantime it became known that Prof. Berov during  consultations had told the New Union for the Democracy (NSD, set  up by expellees or defectors of the Union of the Democratic  Forces) he will approach parliament insisting that ministries of  forestry and foreign economic relations be set up, the latter to  be in charge of tourism as well; the Power Engineering Committee  and the Committee of Geology and Mineral Resources be merged;  and the Posts and Telecommunications Committee be transformed  into an association. The prime minister also reportedly pledged  to come up with a short- term plan of action on behalf of the  cabinet. He further told the MP's of the NSD he will send a  letter to National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov to ask  for an April 27 parliamentary hearing on his ideas for cabinet  changes.    The former Communists' Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) gave  Prime Minister Berov a May 15 deadline to submit a new cabinet  programme and a proposal for cabinet changes. The ethnic Turks'  Movement for Rights and Freedoms, too, declared themselves "pro"  cabinet changes. They were the party on whose mandate the  incumbent cabinet was formed in late 1992. Socialist floor  leader Nora Ananieva on Tuesday told journalists the BSP was  unhappy with a number of cabinet decisions taken during Prime  Minister Berov' absence. "The Council of Ministers has not  given up its normal work despite the difficult circumstances,"  Prof. Berov told the radio interviewer today.    While speaking of cabinet changes, all political forces  showed unambiguously they are preparing for early elections.  The Union of the Democratic Forces (SDS) openly calls for the  cabinet's resignation and early elections this autumn.  Bulgaria's two major labour organizations -- the Podkrepa  Labour Confederation and the Confederation of the Independent  Trade Unions in Bulgaria (KNSB) -- also back the idea of early  elections and level severe attacks against the cabinet.  Podkrepa leader Konstantin Trenchev on a number of occasions  said the cabinet has completely exhausted its capacity and is  most likely to fall by the end of May. A week ago the KNSB  called a rally under anti-cabinet slogans in Sofia. It  scheduled a token strike for May 4 and a nationwide strike for  mid- May. KNSB leader Krustyu Petkov said he will go to the  negotiating table with the cabinet only if Prime Minister Berov  personally guarantees that KNSB's demands, mostly social ones,  will be met. According to KNSB Deputy Chairman Ivan Neykov,  however, "it is not a matter of changing the cabinet but the  approaches and methods applied by the executive."</p>

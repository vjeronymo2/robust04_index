			<p>BFN     [Text] Lanzhou, June 26 (XINHUA) -- Gansu Province, one of  the underdeveloped inland provinces in northwest China, has in  recent years made considerable progress in introducing foreign  funds.    An official of Gansu Foreign Funds Management Commission  said  that the province has introduced 1.25 billion U.S. dollars from  international organizations and foreign countries and regions in  the world, including the World Bank, World Food Program, the  United Nations Development Program, Asian Development Bank,  Canada, the United States, Japan and Germany, as well as Hong  Kong and Japan.    Gansu has rich resources in its vast area. Due to natural  conditions, until the mid-1980s about 75 percent of its people  were living in poverty-stricken areas.    In the 1980s, Gansu introduced foreign funds into its  agricultural development projects to improve the harnessing of  water resources and irrigation.    The World Bank, Asian Development Bank and Japanese and  German Governments also offered loans to Gansu for the  development of its rural industry and technological  transformation of state enterprises.    With the deepening of the reforms and expansion of  opening-up, the province began to introduce foreign-funded  enterprises.    Before 1992, the province had only 39 foreign-funded  enterprises, with total investment of about 30 million U.S.  dollars.    In 1992 and 1993, the province approved 823 foreign-funded  enterprises, with total investment of 480 million U.S. dollars.    The province also used 580 million U.S. dollars worth of  foreign loans.    Last year, more than 320 foreign-funded enterprises went  into  operation, and their export value reached more than 30 million  U.S. dollars.</p>

			<p><P> October 9, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DE KLERK MEETS KEY ANC DEMAND BY OFFERING AMNESTY PLAN TO EXILES  </P> <P> President Frederik W. de Klerk announced Monday that political exiles can begin  applying to return to South Africa, addressing a key demand of the African  National Congress.  </P> <P> His statement followed a three-hour meeting with ANC leader Nelson Mandela at  which they discussed violence in South Africa's black townships, which has  killed about 800 people since mid-August.  </P> <P> De Klerk said exiles, many based in Zambia and other southern African nations,  can immediately begin applying for amnesty for "political offenses."  </P> <P> But he cautioned: "No indemnity for anyone, or for any event or offense, is  granted automatically." He said any possible indemnity would apply only to acts  committed before Monday's meeting.  </P> <P> The move could help resolve one of the major stumbling blocks to peace talks  between the white-led government and the ANC, which has demanded the return of  its estimated 20,000 exiles before beginning full-scale negotiations on  black-white power sharing and ending apartheid.  </P> <P> Until Monday, the government had agreed in principle but never announced a  mechanism.  </P> <P> De Klerk's statement said full details of the process will be announced later.  It also said exiles from other organizations may be included. Smaller black  opposition groups also have members who fled South Africa after committing  politically motivated acts.  </P> <P> The government also agreed to release 15 more political prisoners this week,  the statement said. Dozens have been freed in recent months, but up to 3,000  remain imprisoned, according to the ANC.  </P> <P> Mandela, after the meeting with De Klerk, read a separate joint statement.  </P> <P> "There was general agreement that all sides must do their utmost to bring this  violence to an end," according to the statement. "Note was taken of the  different current perceptions concerning the causes and handling of this  violence. Both sides reaffirmed the need to keep the negotiating process on  course."  </P> <P> There was no specific reference to Mandela's repeated warnings that talks on  South Africa's transition to democracy could be threatened by a continuation of  the violence.  </P> <P> Mandela, who refused to answer questions, has accused security forces of  orchestrating the violence in the black townships. The fighting has been mainly  between supporters of the ANC and members of the rival Inkatha movement, led by  Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi.  </P> <P> The government has repeatedly denied that police or soldiers are fanning the  conflict.  </P></p>

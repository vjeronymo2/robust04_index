Lawmakers decided to examine at 14:00 the  draft of a statement on the situation in the former Yugoslavia.    As Speaker Ivan Rybkin announced, a report would be made by  Sergey Lavrov, a deputy foreign minister since the First Deputy  Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin had not returned from  Yugoslavia yet.    Lawmaker Vyacheslav Marychev (St. Petersburg, the Liberal  Democratic Party) requested debates on the resumption of the TV  feature entitled "Parliamentary Hour." His request was met.    Marychev criticized media, above all TV, for their coverage  of Duma discussions.    At LDP leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's demand, the Duma will  return to the issue on the make-up of the parliamentary  committee on geo-politics.    It is the only committee whose composition has not been  endorsed by the Duma so far. Most legislators are displeased  with the fact that of the 13 committee members, 9 are LDP  officials.    Lawmakers disapproved a motion to elect a fifth vice-speaker  from among the members, elected in one-mandate constituencies.</p>

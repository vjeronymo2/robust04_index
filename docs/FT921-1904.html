			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Property: Realism keeps the Broads in business - Norfolk prices have come down and distress sales are dropping fast The Norfolk Broads are spread down the eastern half of Norfolk, a series of lakes born partly of medieval peat diggings and some slow, connecting rivers. Long an area for waterborne holidays and recreation, effectively they became Britain's 11th national park in 1989. In planning and navigation terms, they are now administered by their own special statutory body, the Broads Authority. Tourism, naturally, has made the villages - strung along the 125 miles of navigable waterway - the stuff of retirement dreams although few of those dreams come true. One local agent reckons that while 70 per cent of footfalls through his door are visitors thinking of moving into the area, less than 10 per cent of them actually make the effort to do so. Many of those then find the pace of life too slow after, say, Essex or Hertfordshire and, eventually, return whence they came. The trouble for them is that moving back is not so easy at present. Norfolk house prices have dropped by more than 30 per cent since their 1988 peak; probably the biggest price reversal in the UK. Indeed, houses are cheaper now than for many years, according to David Richardson, managing director of Hockleys of Norwich. 'With lower interest rates, the removal of stamp duty from most purchases and moderate increases in real incomes, housing costs in real terms are probably at less than half the level of three or four years ago,' he says. But the market seems to be grasping that fact. Richardson notes that the number of sales achieved by Hockleys in Norfolk as a whole, in the 12 months to February 1992, was 77 per cent up on the previous 12 months. Waterfront prices probably start as low as Pounds 35,000 for one-bedroom leasehold timber cabins beside the River Thurne at Potter Heigham, each with its own mooring and easy access to ice cream and fish and chips. Two- or three-bedroomed properties of similar ilk might fetch up to Pounds 60,000 - particularly if they are of sufficient substance to pre-date the start of planning controls in 1948, thus escaping the restrictions on their annual periods of use. That is the holiday and weekender market. Upwards from those prices, though, buyers rarely will get change from Pounds 100,000 for a brick-built waterfront freehold, even on the smallest navigable backwater. In Wroxham, the prime pitch - which, together with Hoveton, across the River Bure, forms the heart of the Broads - houses in Beech Road were fetching up to Pounds 650,000 at the peak of the market (although, at that level, buyers were getting a residence of true quality, with several acres). Buyers in the middle and upper price ranges tend to be local professional and business people, or locals who have moved out and are moving back in their retirement. They have a reasonably wide choice. At Dilham, towards the northern extremity of the Broads and three hours by boat from Wroxham, Pounds 119,000 would buy a detached three-bedroom brick bungalow with a 50ft quay-headed mooring (through Woolwich Property Services). In Hoveton, a relatively modest Pounds 125,000 would buy a three-bedroom timber-framed chalet built in the 1970s (now available through the Stalham office of William H Brown). Just upstream, at Belaugh, Strutt &amp; Parker requires Pounds 245,000 for a five-bedroom barn conversion with 50ft of mooring. Agents say that waterfront prices have been relatively resilient; in general, they put the markdown from the top of the market at perhaps 25 per cent. Inevitably, though, there has been inertia as vendors continued to hope; some present offerings still illustrate substantial compromise. Orchard Mead is a house in Ropes Hill, Horning, a village just downstream from Wroxham and Hoveton. With four bedrooms, two bathrooms, mooring, boathouse and slipway, it was valued at Pounds 290,000 four years ago. In September 1991, it entered the market at Pounds 210,000 (through Woolwich Property Services) but there was little interest until it was reduced, in the first week of January, to Pounds 180,000. It then received three offers. Similarly, Hockleys recently sold the Little House, Lower Street, Horning, for Pounds 170,000. The property, which was once divided into two flats, has seven bedrooms, a 50ft quay-headed mooring and covered boat dock. At the peak of the market, its value was close to Pounds 250,000. Now that vendors have come to terms with the need for realistic pricing, they are in no mood for further messing about. 'Soft' deals are much thinner on the water. Melvyn Stone, manager of the Wroxham office of Woolwich Property Services, says: 'There is still a false idea that, in this market, any vaguely reasonable offer will be accepted, but the supply of distress sales has more or less run out. Most people who now want to sell will do so only at something fairly close to the asking terms.'</p>

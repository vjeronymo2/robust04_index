			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Observer: Bussing in the Royals Since Britain is suffering one of its worst recessions ever, the Queen was right to veto plans to erect a fountain in her honour in Parliament Square. Asking the population to cough up Pounds 2m for a 25ft ornamental sprinkler at a time when many people are either out of work or homeless, would have been insensitive. Nevertheless, if some loyal subjects want to celebrate her 40th anniversary on the throne in a material way, Observer has a suggestion. Why not follow the example of the Dutch, and buy the Queen a bus? True, it will probably have to be imported. But as Princess Diana has shown with her new Mercedes sports car, there is nothing wrong with that. The idea of a royal charabanc is not as silly as it sounds. The Queen already has a 5,800 tonne yacht, a 14-carriage train, three jets and two helicopters, costing the British taxpayer over Pounds 18m a year. By contrast Queen Beatrix's new bus - a gift from the corporate sector  - cost just over Pounds 100,000. Equipped with 12 plush arm chairs, lavatory and automatic coffee maker, it is described as 'luxurious but not extravagant'. Queen Beatrix, who is probably considerably richer than her British counterpart, aims to travel in her new toy at least once a week. Not only is it significantly cheaper than the normal motorcade of six royal Dutch gas-guzzlers, but it is more environmentally friendly. It's the sort of gift which might appeal to Prince Charles, at least.</p>

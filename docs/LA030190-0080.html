			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: ARTESIA;  </P> <P> COUNCIL ASKED TO SPEED UP SEARCH FOR NEW MANAGER  </P> <P> Interim City Manager Jerry Shuster has asked officials to speed up their search  for a permanent chief administrator because he is ready to leave Artesia after  four months in the position.  </P> <P> Shuster, who is a retired finance director of Arcadia, has been interim city  manager of Artesia since October.  </P> <P> He replaced Lois O'Sullivan, who resigned. Shuster, 59, said he took the job  with the understanding he would not be there long. "I did not retire to go back  to work full time," Shuster said.  </P> <P> He said he told the City Council two weeks ago to start a more vigorous search  because he was leaving in 30 days. But Mayor Dennis Fellows said Shuster was  persuaded to remain at least another 60 days, until someone is hired.  </P> <P> Fellows said the council has received one applicant for the job. He said the  council expects to start advertising in newspapers and government publications.  </P> <P> Shuster is paid $40 an hour, but the salary for a permanent administrator is  negotiable and depends on the person's experience.  </P></p>

			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Smith supporters hint at second vote GROWING numbers of Mr John Smith's Labour colleagues are warning privately that he may have to accept another election in two years if, as expected, he wins the contest in July to succeed Mr Neil Kinnock as party leader. A senior member of Labour's frontbench team, who supports Mr Smith's candidacy, said yesterday that the controversy surrounding the unions' role in the election might 'fatally undermine' the authority of the new leader. He suggested that the answer would be for Mr Smith to call a new leadership election in two years, after the franchise for the contest had been changed to effectively exclude the unions. There would be no certainty of a credible challenger, but by suggesting such a contest Mr Smith would be able to deflect inevitable Conservative attacks on the legitimacy of his leadership. Another colleague said there was growing acknowledgement in the Smith camp of the damage inflicted by the refusal of his union supporters to ballot their members before casting their block votes in the electoral college that chooses the party leader. Their comments, echoing the view of Mr Smith's opponents and a growing number of uncommitted Labour MPs, came as Mr Kinnock signalled his determination to press ahead with plans to weaken the authority of the unions. Party officials confirmed that Mr Kinnock would use his remaining short period as leader to try to force through constitutional changes to end the unions' role in the selection of Labour MPs. Mr Kinnock wants this year's party conference to endorse a 'one member, one vote' system for prospective parliamentary candidates.</p>

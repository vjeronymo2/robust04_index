			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / International Company News: First loss for Cap Gemini Sogeti CAP GEMINI Sogeti (CGS), Europe's leading computer services group, yesterday provided further evidence of the recession in the computer industry by publishing its first annual loss. The French group made a net loss of FFr80m (Dollars 14.8m) last year, against a FFr560m net profit in 1991, on turnover up 19 per cent over the same period, to FFr12bn. The sales rise was due to the first-time inclusions of two acquisitions, Volmac and Programmator, the Dutch and Swedish computer services groups, rather than growth in the market. Pre-tax profits fell to FFr45m from FFr584m, after a FFr338m restructuring charge for between 1,000 and 1,500 job losses. Earnings suffered from the twin pressures of the economic downturn and the growing trend for computer manufacturers to diversify into services such as advice on installation, CGS's core business, said Mr Geoff Unwin, one of the group's three presidents. Many computer makers had tried to buy market share by cutting fees, but Mr Unwin predicted that they would not be able to hold rates at unprofitable levels indefinitely. CGS had been able to hold its rates in systems integration, where quality was still at a premium, said Mr Unwin. However, demand was weaker for of computer training, one of the first costs that businesses have sought to trim during the downturn. Another factor in the loss was the upheaval in CGS's scattered subsidiaries, where the group is encouraging units in different countries to work together more often on transnational projects, a service in increasing demand among its larger customers. This has meant replacing the former territorial split of responsibilities with an organisation based on a mixture of sector and geographical lines. CGS expects the first fruits of the reorganisation to show this year.</p>

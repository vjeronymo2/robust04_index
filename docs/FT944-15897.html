			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Food and Drink: Portugal rings the changes - Wine Like most of my colleagues, I am sent an average of between one and two dozen unsolicited bottles of wine a week. To avoid any suggestion of payola, I could refuse them all, but anyone who thinks I can be bought with a selection of supermarket vins de pays (a typical consignment) is welcome to their misapprehension. Ungraciously, we wine writers tend to take for granted these packages, the liquid equivalent of review copies to literary critics. Extremely few of them are positively welcomed in this household. I do try to taste the top centimetre of every bottle but stubbornly tend to drink wines I have chosen and bought myself. On the other hand, only packages heralded by a call from an airport handling agent are cursed; we usually have to pay duty and sometimes storage charges for these. I recently paid Pounds 40 and spent more than an hour unravelling a completely unasked-for consignment of wine from Argentina, each bottle swaddled in layer after layer of newspaper, cardboard and sellotape, cushioned by horribly clinging little polystyrene particles. Half the bottles turned out to be duplicates, and it eventually transpired that their sender simply wanted to show me the redesigned labels. The other day I thought I had found the wine bargain of all time. I opened a bottle of Portuguese red which had been sent to me out of the blue. Most bottles are accompanied by some sort of explanation, or more usually eulogy. This one arrived clueless, except for the particularly downmarket-looking label carrying a theoretically second-rank denomination, Vinho Regio do Alentejo, a region in southern Portugal so far better known for cork and cereals than for wine. I opened it early one evening, my usual tasting time, and did a double-take, scribbling deliriously 'Very, very deep colour. Intense and exciting. Nervy and concentrated in a Penfolds Grange sort of way] Lovely and rich. American oak? Very, very ripe. Lots of tannins but masses of fruit too.' Grange is Australia's most lauded wine, the new 1989 vintage has just been offered by selected Oddbins stores for about Pounds 45 a bottle. This Portuguese wine, on the other hand, looked as though it should sell for Pounds 4.50 at most. Unusually, we savoured every mouthful from the mystery bottle with our supper. Many a phone call later, I finally tracked down this marvellous liquid, called Mouchao after the small Anglo-Portuguese farm on which it is produced. It is made mainly from low-yielding Alicante Bouschet vines, not one of the vine world's most aristocratic members, with local Periquita and Moreto grapes. The grapes are still trodden, in a relatively primitive winery that until recently had no electricity. The wine is then apparently matured for five or more years in old oak casks, so before it is subjected to this generally enervating experience, it must be a truly incredible hulk. This recipe does not sound cheap, does it? In fact, in spite of the low rent label, it costs more than Pounds 10 - Pounds 10.95 from Winos of Oldham, Lancs; Pounds 11.99 from Sherston of St Albans, Herts; Pounds 14.99 from La Vigneronne of London SW7; and an as-yet-uncalculated price from Gauntleys, of Nottingham. Even at Pounds 14.99 it is a good buy for those who admire Grange, Spain's Vega Sicilia and, Portugal's most famous 'expensive' wine, Ferreira's Barca Velha (the 1985 is Pounds 24.99 from Oddbins). There will be no Mouchao 1994; the entire production was destroyed by frost. Thanks to poor flowering and drought the whole Portuguese wine harvest will be short this year, which is a pity since Portugal has become one of the potentially most exciting sources of red wine value. For long a lone Australian called Peter Bright kept sending us exciting smoke signals and keenly- priced bottles of essentially Portuguese wines. During the last year or two, however, he has been joined by increasing numbers of similarly skilled winemakers. David Baverstock, for example, is a refugee from port country and was one of the first to realise that the Douro can also produce some stunning unfortified reds. He is now doing good things at Esporao in Alentejo (see Thresher/Wine Rack/Bottoms Up selections), funded by a well-heeled Portuguese businessman. And an increasing number of co-operatives and estates can offer such keenly-priced, characterful red blends as Falua 1993 (Pounds 2.99 Safeway) and Leziria (around Pounds 2.50 from Kwiksave, Oddbins, Somerfield and Victoria Wine), both from Portugal's farming heartland Ribatejo. Bright's brightest sparks, especially as far as British wine buyers were concerned, were his full, sweet and vibrant oaked Alentejo blend Tinta da Anfora and the oaky Cabernet Quinta da Bacalhoa from the Setubal peninsula, but 1992 was the last vintage under his control. The 1990 vintages of these two wines are currently available. Tinta da Anfora is Pounds 4.79 at Tesco, Pounds 4.95 at Waitrose and Pounds 4.99 at Safeway while Quinta da Bacalhoa is Pounds 5.99 from Sainsbury's and Majestic. They should be snapped up now for they will continue to age over the next five years at least. Bright has struck out on his own, allowing himself to become yet another flying winemaker, in Iberia, South America and Sicily (notably making international varietals for Sainsbury's), rather than concentrating on bringing Portuguese flavours to a wider wine drinking public. Shame - although look out for Bright Brothers wines from Bairrada, Ribatejo and Douro (the latter from Thresher). Enthusiasts for Portugal's unique combination of ripe fruit and Atlantic influence will be able to continue, however, to follow vintages of Quinta de Camarate, whose 1989 (Pounds 4.89 at Victoria Wine) is showing particularly well now, being full-bodied, lively and packed with fruit, most of it incontravertibly Portuguese rather than 'international'.</p>

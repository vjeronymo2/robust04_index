			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / International Company News: Krupp Hoesch posts DM30m loss Krupp Hoesch, the merged steel and engineering group, made a DM30m (Dollars 17.6m) loss in the first quarter. However, the group said it hoped results in the loss-making steel division would improve during the year and that the company would break even in 1994 following a deficit of DM590m in the previous 12 months. Orders in the first quarter rose by 12 per cent and turnover was up 5 per cent compared with the same period last year. Mr Gerhard Cromme, chief executive, said 1993 was one of the worst years for the two companies which were merged in December 1992. Turnover fell 11 per cent to DM24.2bn from DM26.9bn the year before. However, the unspecified savings resulting from the merger would enable the group to generate sufficient earnings in the second half of this year to offset the first-quarter losses, Mr Cromme said. In spite of the projected break-even this year, Mr Cromme said no dividend would be paid in 1994. 'What happens thereafter is speculation,' he added. 'We will still have to do something to shore up the internal structure (of the company) so that a gust of wind doesn't blow us over.' Mr Cromme said the better results were based on improving prospects in the automotive industry, which accounts for about 20 per cent of Krupp Hoesch's turnover. The 1994 results would not be dragged down by redundancy costs, the bulk of which had been included in the previous year's results. A DM780m loss in the steel division was the main reason for the 1993 deficit although the engineering unit made a small loss. Mr Cromme said steel would be the only one of the company's six divisions to make a loss this year and that the company's exposure to steel would be further reduced below the present 25 per cent.</p>

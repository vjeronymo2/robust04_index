Definition of Nationally Recognized Municipal Securities Information Repository  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission requested comment on whether the term ``NRMSIR'' should be defined in Rule 15c2&hyph;12, and whether specific standards should be established for NRMSIRs. If standards were to be established in the rule, the Commission requested comment on whether proposed standards set forth in the release were adequate. <FOOTCITE>152</FOOTCITE>  The majority of state-based information gatherers and disseminators, and other NRMSIRs that addressed the issue of defining the term ``NRMSIR'' supported maintaining the guidelines already established by the Commission in the 1989 Release. <FOOTCITE>153</FOOTCITE>  After reviewing the comment letters, the Commission has determined that the guidance established in the 1989 Release for NRMSIRs should be modified only as necessary to reflect the amendments to Rule 15c2&hyph;12. In determining whether a particular entity is a NRMSIR the Commission will now consider, among other things, whether the repository:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 152 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission suggested that NRMSIRs (a) maintain current, accurate information about municipal securities, including final official statements, the issuer's annual final information, and issuer's notices of material events; (b) have effective systems for the timely collection, indexing, storage and retrieval of these documents; and (c) be capable of national dissemination of final official statements, annual financial information, and notices of material events through electronic dissemination systems, in response to telephone inquiries, and hard copy delivery via facsimile, by mail and by messenger service. The Commission also stressed the importance of timely public availability upon receipt of information by a NRMSIR.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 153 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See, e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , Letter of Bloomberg L.P.; Letter of Cypress Capital Corp. (a dealer chosen by the Louisiana Municipal Association to assist it in developing a repository to collect and disseminate information on Louisiana issuers of municipal securities). In discussing NRMSIRs in the 1989 Release, the Commission noted that in determining whether a particular entity is a NRMSIR, it would look, among other things, at whether the repository: (1) is national in scope; (2) maintains current, accurate information about municipal offerings in the form of official statements; (3) has effective retrieval and dissemination systems; (4) places no limit on the issuers from which it will accept official statements or related information; (5) provides access to the documents deposited with it to anyone willing and able to pay the applicable fees; and (6) charges reasonable fees.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1989 Release at n. 65.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Is national in scope;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Maintains <FOOTCITE>154</FOOTCITE>  current, accurate <FOOTCITE>155</FOOTCITE>  information about municipal offerings in the form of official statements, and annual financial information, notices of material events, and notices of a failure to provide annual financial information undertaken to be provided in accordance with Rule 15c2&hyph;12;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 154 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In the past, the Division of Market Regulation has required that each NRMSIR maintain copies of all disclosure documents. In view of recent requests from information collectors and disseminators, the Division of Market Regulation will review, on a case by case basis, NRMSIR proposals to satisfy the requirement to maintain copies of disclosure documents through a contract with another entity (including the MSRB) that will maintain copies.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Letters from Laurence M. Landau, Vice President, Dow Jones Telerate, to Elizabeth MacGregor, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, (July 18, 1994) and to Gautam S. Gujral, Division of Market Regulation, SEC (August 4, 1994).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See also  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Letter of Storch &amp; Brenner (on behalf of R.R. Donnelly Financial). This flexible approach, requested by industry participants, may allow NRMSIRs to reduce the cost at which they can collect and disseminate disclosure information to broker-dealers and investors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 155 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> It should be noted that NRMSIRs are not being required to verify the accuracy of the information provided them.

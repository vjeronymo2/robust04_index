			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Gondusov] </F>   [Text] Moscow February 24 TASS--Good military training of  Russian commandos shown during their redisposition to the  Sarajevo region was highly estimated by NATO generals, deputy  supreme commander of the NATO Joint Armed Forces in Europe,  General John Waters, who arrived in Moscow on a working visit  today, told ITAR-TASS.    The NATO commander who prior to his appointment to a high  post in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization headed the land  forces in Britain, said he envied his colleague in Bosnia who  had received such a powerful and well trained reinforcement.    Speaking on the difficulties connected with the  redisposition  of the Russian blue helmets, John Waters noted that he knew that  Russian commandos' training was passing in much more complex  conditions, therefore he would rather be surprised if Russian  soldiers and officers had not fulfilled their command's order.    The British General highly appraised Russia's efforts aimed  at settling the armed conflict in Bosnia and stressed that the  NATO welcomed any step which would stop killing people.    John Waters noted that air strikes, as the events in the  Persian Gulf had shown, would have resulted in unjustified  victims amongst the civil population.    The general said that additional peacekeeping forces should  be brought to the region of confrontation specifying that this  problem should be resolved by politicians.    The program of the NATO general's visit to Moscow which will  last until February 26, includes his meetings with the  leadership of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces and  the commander-in-chief of the land forces.    John Waters will also deliver several lectures on the theme  "The NATO Bloc in a Stage of Transformation" to students and  teachers of the Academy of the General Staff, and other  institutions of the Russian Defense Ministry.</p>

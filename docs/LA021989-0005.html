			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRIVATE LIVES: A MOVING EXPERIENCE;  </P> <P> SURE, PACKING UP IS PAINFUL. BUT IT'S THE RESETTLING THAT'S REALLY UNSETTLING.  </P> <P> THE WORST PART OF moving isn't moving. It's the aftermath -- all the  institutional rigmarole you have to go through to reconnect with the planet.  Gas, water, electricity, garbage, phone, newspapers, mail, cable -- it's enough  to send Kafka screaming into the night.  </P> <P> Last fall, I moved from Santa Paula to Ventura, 10 miles west. I made the usual  renter deposits and concessions -- first, last, security, the rights to my next  book and so forth -- and began the reconnect ritual with a call to the local  cable TV company to order service.  </P> <P> "You'll have to come to our office and fill out an application," the cable lady  informed me.  </P> <P> You can order a sarong from India or buy a piece of General Electric by phone,  but for cable TV in Ventura, you have to appear in person. This is supposed to  be the age of convenience. You should have to appear in person only for  haircuts and heart surgery.  </P> <P> I shrewdly figured that I could save money by ordering my cable with Lou. He  owns the house I rent and occupies the upper level. One address, one cable fee,  right? Together, we entered the cable office as smug as debutantes.  </P> <P> Fifteen minutes later, we were back on the street, Lou staring numbly at our  receipts, trying to decipher a dizzying array of fees. Without subscribing to  any premium services -- no Showtime, no HBO, no Cinemax -- we had surrendered  $122.56. "Why do I feel like I've been raped?" Lou muttered.  </P> <P> We hadn't fared well. "You both will need decoder boxes," the cable lady said.  </P> <P> "Why is that?" Lou protested. "My TV is cable-ready. I used to get this same  selection of channels in L.A. without a decoder box."  </P> <P> "Every cable company is different," she said. "With us, you need the decoder.  If you like, we can rent you a remote control for it."  </P> <P> "My TV already has remote," Lou said.  </P> <P> "It won't work with our decoder box. You'll have to rent a special remote from  us."  </P> <P> We walked out grateful that we didn't have to rent special televisions.  </P> <P> The telephone company was more progressive. I was able to order phone service  by phone. A few weeks later, someone from Pacific Bell called to inform me that  I was using my phone too much: "In a six-day period, you made calls totaling  $238.82."  </P> <P> "What is this, a joke?" I replied. "How about if you just send me a bill every  month, and I send you a check?"  </P> <P> "If you continue to make toll calls at this rate," the Pac man intoned, "your  monthly bill will be around $1,000."  </P> <P> Obviously, this was George Orwell calling from the ultimate area code.  </P> <P> "I'm a writer. . . . I work at home. . . . When I'm researching, I make a lot  of calls," I explained. "I paid General Telephone so much money last year that  their annual report listed me as a fixed asset."  </P> <P> "I understand," the Pac man said, not without sympathy. "But I'm afraid this is  our policy for new customers. We're going to send you a special bill for the  $238.82. It's due in a week."  </P> <P> A polite follow-up letter explained that Pacific Bell gets nervous when a new  customer's phone charges exceed $150. Hit $400, and it gets nervous again. And  every time it gets nervous, it sends a bill. This is on top of the monthly  bill. Touch enough tones, and you could get four bills between new moons.  </P> <P> The U.S. Postal Service is another force movers must reckon with. For some  reason, my mail wasn't finding its way to my new address, so I ambled on down  to the post office to inquire why.  </P> <P> I'm sad to report that the image of mail carriers completing their appointed  rounds through sleet and snow and dark of night belongs to a bygone era. The  problem, I was told by a supervisor, was our curb-side mailbox. Invariably, a  car is parked in front of it, so the carrier, without bothering to notify us,  was boycotting our house. "The carrier has to be able to approach the mailbox  from directly in front of the box," the supervisor explained. "We don't want  'em reaching in blind. Never know what sort of hazard might be in there."  </P> <P> "How often do carriers encounter hazards in mailboxes?" I asked.  </P> <P> The supervisor shrugged. "Not very often."  </P> <P> My father, in his venerable wisdom, had a different view of the matter. "They  just don't like having to get out of their trucks and walk 5 feet to the curb,"  he scoffed.  </P> <P> "I guess they're on to the notion that time is money," I offered.  </P> <P> "Hell," my father groused, "why don't they just drive down the street without  stopping at all? Just keep the mail in the truck. That would save a lot of  time."  </P> <P> The disheartening aspect of all these movers' miseries is that they involve  monopolies. If you don't like your local phone or cable company or your mail  service, what are you going to do, threaten to take your business elsewhere?  </P> <P> It was with a liberating sense of control, then, that I attended to a banking  matter. In dealing with a bank, I feel that I have at least a modicum of  free-enterprise leverage. I strode purposefully into the branch of my bank  closest to my new abode and approached a young man at a teller's window who was  eager to be of service.  </P> <P> "My account is at the branch on the other side of town," I explained. "But I've  just moved to this neighborhood, so I'll be conducting my transactions at this  office."  </P> <P> "No problem!"  </P> <P> "Would there be any advantage to actually moving my account to this office?"  </P> <P> After a moment of serious contemplation, he replied, "Well, it's closer."  </P> <P> There was nothing in his tone or expression to indicate that he was trying for  humor.  </P> <P> I returned home to discover that the mail carrier, somehow managing to prevail  against automotive impediments, had anointed my box with a solitary piece of  mail.  </P> <P> A bill from Pacific Bell.  </P> <P> I was moved.  </P></p>

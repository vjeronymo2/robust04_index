Fifteen african countries were not party to any  drug-control treaty, according to the International Narcotics  Control Board (INCB) 1993 report.    It said the worldwide drug menace had outgrown its  traditional classification as a criminal and social issue to  penetrate international politics and economics.    Although the INCB recognised prevailing political, economic,  social and even climatic conditions that created obstacles for  African governments, it said limited law enforcement and weak  control over the pharmaceutical market had contributed to  increased drug abuse. Increased cultivation of dagga was  attributed to growing domestic demand and trafficking to  European markets. Supplies came from local cultivation and  regional trafficking, said the report, which annually reviews  the world drug scene and international compliance with three  major drug control treaties.    Heroin abuse, which a few years ago was a limited  phenomenon,  was increasing because African airports were being used to  smuggle the drug into mainly European markets. A similar trend  had been observed with cocaine, mainly in west Africa.    The current drug pattern in Africa showed how quickly abuse  and trafficking could spread in a region, notably central Africa  and most recently to southern Africa where the report  highlighted the illicit manufacture and distribution of  methaqualone (mandrax).    Established in 1968 as an independent and quasi-judicial  organ for the implementation of the United Nations drug  conventions, the INCB seeks to identify weaknesses in national  and international drug control.</p>

			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / August jump in truck sales leaves new cars trailing Registrations of new commercial vehicles were 19.9 per cent higher last month than August last year, at 37,259. The rise was in contrast to sales of new cars, which rose by only 2.8 per cent year-on-year. The recovery in sales of vans, trucks and buses has spread to all sectors of the market, including purchases by small businesses. Sales of trucks in August, the most important month for sales of new vehicles, jumped by 27.9 per cent to 6,282, with a particularly strong increase in the sale of trucks for the construction sector and long-distance haulage. Commercial vehicle registrations are an important economic indicator, and August sales were sharply higher than a year ago in most sectors, figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show. Registrations of light vans (up to 1.8 tonnes) rose 24.9 per cent to 11,136, while sales of medium vans (1.81-3.5 tonnes) rose 16.3 per cent. The pick-up in new-vehicle purchases by businesses was also reflected in sales of new cars in August, with purchases by fleets (operating 25 or more cars) rising by 18.2 per cent to 156,098. In the first eight months fleet car sales rose by 16.1 per cent to 620,655. Sales to private-car buyers, which had been growing by 10 per cent earlier this year, fell by 4.4 per cent, in spite of a big marketing campaign. Commercial vehicle registrations have risen strongly nearly every month this year, ending four years of continuous decline from a peak of 371,104 in 1989. Registrations fell by 2.1 per cent in the whole of last year to 197,067. In the first eight months of this year registrations rose by 16.3 per cent to 157,368. The recovery in the market has been accompanied by a surge in imports, however, in particular of trucks and light vans. The share taken by imported commercial vehicles in the first eight months jumped to 43.3 per cent from 40.8 per cent in the corresponding period a year ago. The contraction of the UK truck industry has led to a surge in imports in this sector with an increase of 52.8 per cent in an overall market that has grown by 23.2 per cent. Rover is to increase the prices of its cars, except for the 600 and 800 ranges, by an average of 1.7 per cent with effect from September 19. Most carmakers, including market leaders Ford and Vauxhall, have already announced price increases for this autumn.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- UK COMMERCIAL VEHICLE REGISTRATIONS JANUARY-AUGUST 1994  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                 Volume     Volume  Share (%) Share (%)                                 (Units)  Change (%)   Jan-     Jan-                                                     Aug' 94   Aug' 93  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Total Market*                 157,368      +16.3      100.0     100.0 Imports                        68,211      +23.6       43.3      40.8  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Small vans (up to 1.8 tonnes) Total                          49,616      +20.4      100.0     100.0 Imports                        19,686      +32.7       39.7      36.0 Ford                           22,174      +19.7       44.7      44.9 Vauxhall (General Motors)      14,192      +11.1       28.6      31.0 Renault                         3,482      +39.2        7.0       6.1 PSA Peugeot Citroen             2,918      +11.5        5.9       6.3 Rover (BMW)                     2,184       +4.8        4.4       5.1  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Medium vans &amp; pick-ups (1.81 -  3.5 tonnes) Total                          68,697      +13.1      100.0     100.0 Imports                        26,802      +12.2       39.0      39.3 Ford                           32,259       +7.2       47.0      49.6 LDV                             7,817      +24.7       11.4      10.3 Volkswagen                      5,550      +31.1        8.1       7.0 Mercedes-Benz (Daimler-Benz)    5,490      +64.0        8.0       5.5 Renault                         3,968      +11.7        5.8       5.8 Nissan                          2,870      +22.1        4.2       3.9 Vauxhall (GM)                   2,805      +10.2        4.1       4.2 PSA Peugeot Citroen             2,645      -18.1        3.9       5.3 Toyota                          2,520       -3.8        3.7       4.5  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Trucks (over 3.5 tonnes) Total                          27,580      +23.2      100.0     100.0 Imports                        16,166      +52.8       58.6      47.2 Iveco group**(Fiat)             6,501      +11.9       23.6      25.9 Mercedes-Benz (Daimler-Benz)    4,909      +25.3       17.8      17.5 Leyland DAF (DAF Trucks)        4,805      +19.4       17.4      18.0 Volvo                           3,652      +30.1       13.2      12.5 Scania (Investor)               2,291      +31.9       8.3        7.8 MAN                             1,683      +41.9       6.1        5.3 ERF                             1,477      +26.3       5.4        5.2 Renault                         1,145      +39.1       4.2        3.7 Of which Heavy Trucks (over 15 tonnes) Total                          16,072      +31.4     100.0      100.0 Volvo                           3,316      +30.4      20.6       20.8 Leyland DAF (DAF Trucks)        2,505      +52.7      15.6       13.4 Scania (Investor)               2,291      +31.9      14.3       14.2 Iveco group**(Fiat)             2,197      +16.9      13.7       15.4 Mercedes-Benz (Daimler-Benz)    1,851      +23.5      11.5       12.3 ERF                             1,477      +26.3       9.2        9.6 MAN                               897      +25.8       5.6        5.8 Renault                           648     +109.7       4.0        2.5  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- (names in brackets indicate ownership)  * includes buses and light four wheel drive utility vehicles. ** includes Iveco Ford and Seddon Atkinson.

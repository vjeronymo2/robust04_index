However, they  did not reach the common position that was the case at the upper  chamber, because William L. Swing and Frantz Robert Monde  expressed differing points of view on the Haitian crisis and the  measures adopted by the international community. President  Monde, once more, called on the Americans for more humaneness  toward Haiti and solicited the lifting of the embargo:    [Begin recording] [Monde] It is the richest country in the  world, the most prosperous, the most powerful that is imposing  economic sanctions on the weakest, poorest one on earth. We  asked him to ask the international community to view the crisis  on a more humane angle -- the unfairness, the human aspect of  the embargo -- the solution to the crisis in order to avoid a  social explosion, according to critics of the policy of the  international community which is adhering to the Governors  Island accord.    [Reporter] What was the ambassador's answer?    [Monde] The same: It is not our fault; it is the military's  fault. However, they did not realize that their approach to the  crisis was greatly biased, which explains the fact that they  have personalized the crisis as between two men, making a  solution very difficult. [end recording]    This visit by the U.S. ambassador comes at a time when the  Chamber of Deputies has basically resumed normal operations,  while the Senate of the Republic is heading for a new rupture  that is becoming more and more imminent.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Vitaliy Golobachev: "Much Ado About Nothing?"] </F>   [Text] There was a report in the press yesterday to the  effect that it had been "decided in principle that Viktor  Chernomyrdin should resign on health grounds and Yuriy Skokov  should be appointed to the post." It was also reported that the  president had actually met with Yu. Skokov and the relevant  draft edicts had now been prepared.    But senior officials in the Russian presidential and  government apparatuses denied these reports. "Someone was very  keen to destabilize the situation in the country and cause  trouble on the threshold of the election race," I was told by  Valeriy Grishin, deputy chief of the Russian Federation  Government Press Service, who, incidentally, had been cited in  the press. "I did not talk to anyone on this subject. This  false report has reverberated worldwide. For example, we are  being telephoned and quizzed by anxious staff of foreign  banks.... It is just another `scenario,' which could cause the  country material as well as psychological damage..."    Vyacheslav Kostikov made a very strong statement on the  Russian president's behalf, describing the rumors as "downright  lies. Let all the conjecture and speculation on this subject be  on the conscience of the unscrupulous journalists and the  politicians who are behind reports of this kind," Kostikov said.</p>

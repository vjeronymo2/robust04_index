			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yadviga Yuferova report: "Moscow: It Is Dangerous to Life </F> Not To Fight for Life"]    [Text] The capital's government has approved the program  "Moscow Safety." Not that much money has so far been allocated  to implementing it over the next two years -- 2.6 billion  rubles. The program's scientific and technical council is  headed by B. Nikolskiy, first deputy mayor of Moscow.    The last time the piercing alarm sirens were sounded in  Moscow was more than half a century ago, signaling enemy air  raids. Today there are over 800 of these devices located  throughout the city -- may fate spare every one of us from  hearing that alarm.    Leading scientists and practical experts headed by N.  Makhutov, corresponding member of the Russian Academy of  Sciences, have spent more than six months substantiating  possible actions in emergency situations: First, what to do  when it has all happened and, second, what to do to prevent a  tragedy.    The program is of a scientific-organizational nature. Its  purpose is to "reduce the risk of emergency situations, lessen  their consequences, ensure efficient actions to eliminate them,  and create conditions for accident-free work at industrial  enterprises and municipal service installations."    Given our talent for closing the stable door after the horse  has bolted, this is a serious psychological step. Having cast  off the decrepit clothes of the old principles of civil defense,  society must work out and inwardly adopt the principles of  mutual collective safety. Because not only malicious but also  negligent actions by just one person can pose a threat to the  lives of millions of people, and so man-made [tekhnogennyy]  accidents come to the fore in terms of the gravity of their  consequences.    In Moscow today there are 66 dangerous installations, but do  not think that the nine nuclear reactors head this list.  Extremely toxic poisons (ETP's, as the professionals say) are  concentrated at food enterprises, cold combines, and  water-purification stations. The scientific and technical  program provides for a search for new coolants and a strict  regime for servicing those workplaces where it used to be hard  to find a sober fitter. The government also expects from the  specialists a substantiated list of particularly harmful  production processes which it would be less painful to close  down than to continue operating.    One more important point. Dangerous freight frequently  passes through Moscow. The program also provides for a system  to license such transit.    Epidemics, explosions, accidents, fires, and natural  cataclysms, against which it is impossible to insure, demand  efficient work by all the city's rescue services. A single  control center will very soon be created for all of Moscow's  emergency services. It is a pity that today it is still not  possible to announce this telephone number.    In March, in the article "Revolt in Moscow More Terrible  Than  Nuclear War," I wrote about the big city's most vulnerable  spots. In particular, in the capital today there are more than  8,500 high-rise blocks, but the ladders the firemen have had at  their disposal reached only to the 16th floor. If something  were to happen higher up, hope would have to be placed in the  Highest [as published]. Here is today's comforting news:  Creation of a helicopter service in Moscow is vigorously under  way, and in an emergency help will come literally from the sky.  Also, three extra-length ladders which can reach the 22nd floor  have been purchased abroad to fight fires in high-rise  buildings. It would, of course, be better for those who live on  the 23rd floor not to catch fire....    In 1995, for the first time in the city's history, an annual  report "On the Safety of the Population" will be submitted to  the Government of Moscow.    The recently deceased writer Ales Adamovich liked to repeat:  Only one person can save the world, and that person is you.</p>

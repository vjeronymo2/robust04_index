			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Arts: A troubled Winter With A Winter's Tale, one gets exactly what the title suggests: the play starts with a brief shaft of pale sunlight, then gets steadily darker before shifting to the bucolic and ending in reconciliation in the court of Sicily where the tale began. It is one of the simplest of Shakespeare's plays, but also one of the most satisfying, because the story is so good. It is a tragi-comedy because although it has a happy ending, no-one can forget the pain that has gone before. The Winter's Tale is a very good plot for an opera. The Theatre de Complicite, which, in spite of its name is British, is a touring company that places heavy emphasis on training, research and the use of theatre workshops. Its creative standards are high. The company has not previously gone in for the classics, so one looked forward to this production at the Lyric, Hammersmith with a mixture of pleasure, curiosity and trepidation. The result is a curate's egg. The company is too good not to produce surprises and the odd stunning effect. On the other hand, The Winter's Tale is too good a play to need tampering with. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. The piece is described in the company's own summary as 'a violent nightmare of jealousy, destruction and hatred that becomes the miracle of a waking dream through the workings of the gods, Time, good fortune and great women'. That is a reasonably accurate outline, and it is a passable joke that Time should be represented as Time magazine. One's doubt is the feminist stress on 'great women'. Some of the men, though of humbler origins, come out of the play just as well as the girls. Quite the best moment in Annabel Arden's direction comes when the old shepherd emerges through the crackling storm, orders the sound effects to stop and finds the infant Perdita abandoned on the shore. That is the signal that the play falls into two parts and we know that we have moved into calmer waters. It is also the signal for the company changing gear and beginning to embroider the text. The shepherd - well played by Kathryn Hunter, who has four parts altogether - adds lines of his own. The rogue Autolycus is played by Marcello Magni, one of the founders of the company. He speaks and sings half his lines in Italian and conducts a wonderful flirtation with a lady in the front row. Nothing wrong with that - some of it is very funny - except that it does not really fit with the playing of part one which has been faithful enough to the text, but has been excessively violent. One knows that Leontes is a dangerous man whose jealousy leads to terrible consequences, yet I wonder if he has to be quite as physically brutal, viciously kicking his servants and guards. That violence leaves a nasty taste which never quite goes away. It should be sufficient to show it through suggestion: the subtlety of the part is lost by being so explicit. Better to play him as a tortured introvert than a brutish beast. I should add that when he returns at the end, Leontes is a transformed figure, an ageing man who movingly conveys his remorse. He is played by Simon McBurney, another of the company's founders. It is a tribute to him that I doubt if you would know without looking at the programme, that he doubles as the shepherd's son. Technically, the company is very inventive. The pity is that it has taken some of the beauty out of The Winter's Tale. The Winter's Tale, Lyric, Hammersmith, until May 2. Sponsored by Beck's Beer.

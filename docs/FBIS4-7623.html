			<p>BFN     [Text] The Serbian national corpus this week heard with  relief the news from Knin that the parties had agreed to form a  government of national unity in Krajina. Just as Prime  Minister-designate Borislav Mikelic announced this information,  a statement by the Serbian Democratic Party [SDS] of Krajina  appeared, saying that its leader, Milan Babic, had postponed the  negotiations on his participation in the Serbian Krajina  government. This was the reason why we asked Borislav Mikelic,  whom not even his biggest enemy can deny wisdom and above all  flexibility in establishing contact with everyone, what had  actually happened. In asking this question, we were primarily  prompted by the fact that the war in the republic of Serbian  Krajina is still going on, that companies have not worked for  nearly three years, that 40,000 pensioners have not received  their pensions for months, and that hundreds of children have  lost their parents -- that is, that another hour should not be  wasted in forming the government. This is another reason to  listen to Mikelic's statement:    [Begin Mikelic recording] I was of the opinion that we must  carry out our task and form the government. I began from the  premise that I had capable people for individual departments and  not ministries, since it would be difficult to talk about  ministries within the framework of the republic of Serbian  Krajina at the moment. These ministries could perhaps be  established only in three or four spheres; however, in other  spheres this is not possible, bearing in mind the circumstances.  Therefore, I am viewing the situation realistically.    On the basis of this plan, I proposed to the SDS four  mandates and that Mr. Babic be appointed deputy prime minister  for international relations and for liaisons with the Serbs in  diaspora, which I believe is a sphere that he could cover. In a  sense, he would be the first deputy prime minister in the  government led by myself. To the radicals, keeping in mind that  they already have the chairman of the assembly, I offered  another two mandates. In this second stage, I did not even take  into consideration the parties and their size but was motivated  by finding expert people -- that is, to draw into the government  those who can cover certain expert fields, as well as what is  feasible at this stage.    Therefore, I made certain compromises here -- in some  spheres  even at the expense of quality -- with the aim of creating a  government of national unity and to finally show those in the  West, in Croatia, and others who are against the republic of  Serbian Krajina that we can work together, that we -- Martic,  Babic, Mikelic, Bjegovic, and all others who can in a way offer  to the nation a little more than what has been offered so far --  will stick together. Thus, I held talks with the SDS and its  president, Dr. Babic. In principle, he accepted my offer. I now  hear that the SDS has issued a statement that they embrace the  government of national unity, but based on the parity principle  taking into consideration the number of parliamentary seats, and  also that Babic has postponed his participation in the  government. I view this as a SDS statement and not a statement  by Milan Babic. If the SDS coordinated this with him, then Mr.  Babic will probably inform me about it. For the time being  though, I have not heard this from him -- that is, that he has  postponed his participation. If he has postponed it and perhaps  given up on this approach, then he could have done it only after  our talks.    This is my approach and if I will not be able to fulfill it,  then I doubt that I could agree to be prime minister in a  government that would reflect the parliament -- that is, a  government in which the majority and minority parties would  disagree on certain decisions and to have the party struggle  transferred to the government. I would not want to head such a  government. They will have to find someone else. I have agreed  to offer my services and come to Knin for patriotic reasons. I  am willing to work and help some people save [words indistinct]  for the sake of Krajina's future. However, if someone wants to  place party interests above national ones -- I believe that  national interests are above the party's interests -- then the  people should judge what is more correct right now -- what I  have to offer or what the party leaders and some party clubs  have to offer.

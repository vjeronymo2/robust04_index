			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / International Company News: Metall Mining bids for exploration group Metall Mining, the international mining arm of Germany's Metallgesellschaft, has launched a hostile takeover bid for a small Vancouver-based company whose main asset is a rich gold and copper deposit in Argentina. Metall, which is based in Toronto, has offered to buy all the outstanding common shares of International Musto Explorations for CDollars 232m (Dollars 178.5m), or CDollars 16.25 per share payable in cash or Metall convertible preferred shares. Metall has a strong balance sheet, including about CDollars 250m in cash. Metallgesellschaft is expected to sell its 50.1 per cent stake in the Canadian company as part of the financial restructuring which has followed its near collapse. The disposal is dependent on the agreement of Metall's partners in various joint ventures, as well as securities firms which underwrote a recent Metall share issue. The offer is conditional on Musto not disposing of a large part of its 100 per cent stake in the Bajo de la Alumbrera deposit in north-west Argentina. The property is estimated to contain 5.8bn lbs of copper and 10m ounces of gold. Metall said that at least 50.1 per cent of Musto shares must be tendered for its bid to go ahead. Metall made an identical offer to Musto last week, but was turned down by its management in favour of a joint venture proposal from another unidentified company. Musto has been seeking a partner to help finance and develop a mine on the Alumbrera property at an estimated cost of CDollars 550m.</p>

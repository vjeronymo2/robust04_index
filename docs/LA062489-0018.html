			<p><P> June 24, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHAT'S IN A NAME? MORE THAN MEETS EYE  </P> <P> In his June 17 letter to Viewpoint, Bruce Carnachan suggests that the Chevrolet  Indy V-8 engine should not be referred to by its proper name but rather as the  "Ilmor" or "Ilmor-Chevrolet."  </P> <P> Chevrolet did not merely spend "millions of dollars to put its name on the  valve covers," as Carnachan suggests. Eleven Chevrolet and General Motors  engineering groups, working across the United States, from Santa Barbara to  Rochester, N.Y., have contributed a great deal of American technology to this  engine.  </P> <P> The original contract specifies that the engine be formally named the Chevrolet  Indy V-8.  </P> <P> Carnachan's corruption of the name is illogical as someone suggesting that he  be called "Glen Dale Carnachan" because he happens to live in Glendale.  </P> <P> DAVE HEDERICH  </P> <P> Manager, Product Publicity  </P> <P> Chevrolet Central Office  </P> <P> Warren, Mich.  </P></p>

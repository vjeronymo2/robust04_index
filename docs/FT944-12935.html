			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Books: A guide and a gambler - Iain Macleod was a man of paradoxes IAIN MACLEOD. A BIOGRAPHY by Robert Shepherd Hutchinson Pounds 25, 608 pages Iain Macleod has been a legendary figure in the Tory Party for so long that it is surprising we have had to wait until now for a comprehensive biography. Even posthumously, paradoxes abound. Macleod was one of the first senior Tory MPs to recognise the talents of the young Margaret Thatcher. As shadow chancellor in the mid-1960s, he insisted that she should be his second-in-command, and let her rip. He concluded quickly that one day there could be a woman prime minister, and it might be her. At the same time, as we now know, Macleod was the hero of another aspiring politician who was also a future prime minister: John Major. It was Macleod's appeal to one nation and his ability to captivate a Tory Party conference that Major admired. Yet Macleod made enemies as well as friends. Lord Salisbury, once a force to be reckoned with in the party, dismissed him as 'too clever by half', and the charge stuck. Alec Douglas Home, in whose cabinet Macleod declined to serve, thought that Macleod was naive, especially over Africa. Macleod thought that Home was the most arrogant man he ever met. In one telling case, friendship turned to ashes. Two of the guiding lights in the post-1945 Conservative Party were Macleod and Enoch Powell. Macleod long regarded Powell as an intellectual mentor, even if he seldom went all the way with his conclusions. When Powell turned against coloured immigration, the friendship died. Some of Macleod's other likes and dislikes have no obvious explanation. He rather liked James Callaghan: the pair of them shadowed each other across the House of Commons first on colonial policy, then on the economy. He had a marked distaste for Roy Jenkins, despite the fact that the kind of Britain that both of them wanted to see must have been practically identical. He professed to despise Harold Wilson, although Wilson was one of his greatest admirers. Above all, Macleod thought that Edward Heath was boring and never considered him as a serious contender for the leadership of the party until it was too late to stop him. In short, Macleod was a very unusual man, which is what this book is about - or should be. At times Robert Shepherd's biography is a little too comprehensive, a mite too taken up with detail, to let the story of the man come through. Yet the story is still there. Macleod was a gambler. Early in the war, after a bout of drinking, he attempted to shoot his commanding officer for refusing to play stud poker with him. But that was an aberration. On the whole he gambled astutely. He made his spending money out of playing bridge and writing about it in the newspapers. He helped to invent the Acol system of bidding - named after a club in Acol Road, South Hampstead. Shepherd perhaps understates the importance of this. The system works by keeping the initial bidding low in order to allow for a possible dramatic change of suit later on. That was how Macleod worked in everything. As minister of labour in the late 1950s, he loved bargaining with the unions over pay. Some of the union leaders respected him for it. At one stage, during a famous London bus strike, a group of them went to see him privately to say that Frank Cousins, the transport and general workers' leader, should be taken down a peg. Macleod continued in much the same style as colonial secretary. In retrospect, that was far and away his most important job. When he appointed him after the 1959 general election, Harold Macmillan noted that 'Africa seems to be the biggest problem looming for us here at home'. Macleod's task was to accelerate independence without provoking massive unrest. He did it through a series of cliff-hanging negotiations during which both blacks and whites often claimed that they had no idea which way he would play the cards. The unrest that resulted was mainly in the Tory Party at home, which was why Macmillan removed him from the job after two years. Nothing that Macleod did subsequently quite lived up to the African achievement. For a while he seemed a possible future leader, but was pre-empted by Home and then overtaken by Heath. He might have been a very good, tax-reforming chancellor of the exchequer when the Tories returned to office in 1970, but he died within a month. There were other sides to Macleod's character apart from the gambler. He was brought up in Yorkshire, but had roots in the Scottish isles. His father was a GP from whom Macleod inherited a social conscience. His first mark in politics was to speak up for the reform, but also the preservation, of the health service. His belief in the brotherhood of man lay behind his approach to African independence. Previous colonial secretaries had been well off: Macleod had to cash in his life insurance policy to defray his expenses. He loved poetry and could quote it at length; also sport. From early on, his physical health was not good and grew steadily worse. He concealed his pain very well. He was a great speaker with a marvellous voice and immaculate sense of timing. He was also a sparkling journalist, as his stint as editor of The Spectator revealed after he refused to serve under Home. Yet he was undoubtedly ambitious for the premiership and, as Shepherd points out, could be devious and calculating. Shepherd perhaps attributes too many of the unsigned articles in The Spectator to Macleod himself. I know because I was there. When he wrote his most famous article of all on the Tory magic circle, I suggested that we should put on the cover simply 'What Happened' by Iain Macleod. 'That'll do,' he said. Then he chuckled and added quietly: 'Well, some of what happened.'</p>

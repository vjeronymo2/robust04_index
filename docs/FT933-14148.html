			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / International Company News: Rubbermaid advances to Dollars 50.6m RUBBERMAID, the household plastic goods company, yesterday posted a 16 per cent improvement in second-quarter net income on sales which rose 9 per cent, reflecting the success of new products and aggressive marketing which helped lift volume in the quarter. For the three months to June 30, net income was Dollars 50.6m, or 32 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 488.5m, against earnings of Dollars 43.7m, or 27 cents, on sales of Dollars 449.1m a year earlier. Mr Wolfgang Schmitt, Rubbermaid's recently-appointed chief executive, said: 'We intend to deliver another record year in 1993. New product efforts have been intensified with plans to exceed 1992's level of introducing, on average, a new product every day of the year. 'With the momentum of these new products and some firming in the economy, we would expect second-half sales comparisons to exceed those of the first half,' he said. Mr Schmitt added that the company continued to emphasise cost controls and productivity improvement. He was named chairman of Rubbermaid in November after the unexpected resignation of Mr Walter Williams following an examination ordered by outside directors of budget overruns in Rubbermaid's commercial products division. Mr Williams is said to have resigned for personal reasons, unconnected with the examination. For the first six months, Rubbermaid had net income of Dollars 100.2m, or 63 cents, against Dollars 67.4m, or 41 cents, a year ago.</p>

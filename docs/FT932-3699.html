			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: Yen continues sharp rise - At a glance The yen continued to rise sharply against the dollar this week defying repeated intervention from the Federal Reserve. It reached a high of Y105.95 against the dollar to fall back a little by the end of the week. Underpinning the yen's strength has been a US Treasury Department report in May stating that a higher yen could help reverse Japan's huge trade surplus. It was thought that the US would be calling for a strong yen at the trade talks with Japan which began yesterday and at the summit next month of the Group of Seven.</p>

			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOBACCO TAX  </P> <P> In his letter printed Aug. 11, A.J. Tobias delights in his circumvention of the  state tobacco tax, gloating that "the creators of the tobacco tax must think we  smokers are a bunch of dum-dums."  </P> <P> Smoking has been proven to cause cancer, emphysema and birth defects and is the  leading cause of preventable death in the country. Each time a smoker lights  up, be it a cigarette, cigar or pipe, he has proven himself to be the dum-dum  indeed.  </P> <P> JOEL PERRY  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

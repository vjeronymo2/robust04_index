			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SHE AND HER HUSBAND ARE IN THE SAME BOAT;  </P> <P> MAGERS AT HOME ON WATER, CLAY, GRASS . . .  </P> <P> Pittsburgh is known as the city of Three Rivers, but growing up there did  little to prepare Gretchen Magers for life at sea.  </P> <P> The fresh but not so clean waters of the Monongahela, Allegheny and Ohio rivers  bear little resemblance to the salty Pacific Ocean. And life on the Gypsy Lady  is far from the hills of Pittsburgh, even if the 34-foot sailboat spends most  of its time docked at Harbor Island.  </P> <P> "All I had done with boats was canoeing," Magers said of her nautical training  while growing up in the Pittsburgh suburb of Mt. Lebanon.  </P> <P> But for another year at least, the Gypsy Lady is home for Magers and her  husband, Stephen, a graduate student at San Diego State. That is, when Magers  is not out on the professional tennis tour.  </P> <P> This week, she is combining a visit home and her work. Magers is competing in  Great Bank American tennis tournament at the San Diego Tennis and Racquet Club.  </P> <P> In tonight's final match on center court, Magers will play in the second round  against Angelica Gavaldon, a 15-year-old junior from Our Lady of Peace High  School. Gavaldon is coming off a three-set upset of eighth-seeded Ros Fairbank.  </P> <P> "You can't go in worrying about her," said Magers, 25, who beat Pascale  Paradis, 6-1, 7-5 in her first-round match Monday. "I have lost to 15-year-olds  before, and it is going to happen again. I can't worry about her age."  </P> <P> If Magers sounds undaunted by the prospect of facing an amateur with nothing to  lose, it probably is because she is playing as consistently well as she has in  some time.  </P> <P> She is coming off her best Wimbledon, where she reached the quarterfinals  before she was eliminated by eventual runner-up Martina Navratilova, 6-1, 6-2.  She also has a two-set victory over fifth-ranked Arantxa Sanchez, the French  Open champion from Spain, in the Players Championship in March.  </P> <P> "I've had some of the best wins of my career this year," Magers said.  </P> <P> The most exciting probably was her second-round Wimbledon match against  ninth-ranked Pam Shriver. The match was long and tense, with Magers winning the  final set of the three-set match, 12-10.  </P> <P> Magers went on to reach the quarterfinals of a Grand Slam event for the first  time since she did it in the 1983 French Open as a 19-year-old freshman at  Trinity (Tex.) College.  </P> <P> The next year at Trinity, she met her future husband.  </P> <P> Stephen was on the football team, but it was in biology class that the two  became friends. They married in December 1986 and moved to San Diego the next  year.  </P> <P> San Diego was an ideal location because Stephen could work on his master's  degree in exercise physiology while Magers took advantage of the climate and  availability of other pros to work on her game.  </P> <P> "There are tons of tennis players our here," Magers said, "and the weather is  even better out here than Texas."  </P> <P> When they first arrived, they took an apartment in La Mesa. But after a few  months of paying rent double what they were used to San Antonio, they thought  of getting a place of their own. Their problem was no different than that for  any potential first-time home buyer in San Diego -- sticker shock and economic  uncertainty.  </P> <P> "It might be more psychological than the actual burden of it," Magers said. "We  were renting a small house in San Antonio for $350. We were in a condo out  here, and it was $750.  </P> <P> "We were only going to be here for two years for sure, and we really didn't  want to get into a house. Stephen doesn't have a job yet, and my job is up and  down. I can get injured this afternoon. We just weren't ready for the  responsibility of a house."  </P> <P> The boat, Magers quickly points out, was her husband's idea.  </P> <P> "It was something that he kind of always wanted to do, which he never told me  before," Magers said. "I came back from a trip and he told me, 'Let's go down  and look at some boats.' I said, 'Why?' "  </P> <P> Stephen had a sailing background from his days growing up in Houston and  sailing in Galveston Bay. "As much as I enjoy tennis," Magers said, "he enjoys  sailing."  </P> <P> And he was itching to get back on the water. He also told her a boat would be a  good investment.  </P> <P> Magers was not so sure. But in the spirit of marital harmony, she went along.  Almost two years later, she has even found it in herself to work up some  enthusiasm for the adventure.  </P> <P> "It has been a great experience," Magers said. "We have met some really  fantastic people that, if we lived in the condos, we wouldn't have been exposed  to.  </P> <P> "We've gotten a lot more out of it than we thought we would -- the pleasure we  have had sailing and living a different life style. We were up there in  Yuppyville up there in one of the condos, and it is real easy to go along with  what everyone else is doing."  </P> <P> Although some luxuries are missing ("We don't have a Cuisinart," Magers said)  and her doubles partner this week, Robin White, has possession of her stereo  and futon, it is not as though the Magers are roughing it. The boat has two  berths and is equipped with most all of the modern conveniences, including a  microwave and VCR.  </P> <P> And because Magers spends so much time on the road and outside when she's in  town, the small living quarters do not seem too confining. As for taking the  boat out to sea, Magers usually leaves that to Stephen.  </P> <P> "I do a little bit when it is good conditions," Magers said. "But I get a  little nervous. I'm still not real confident. When the wind starts blowing  really strong, I'm really not confident. I'm much more confident being the crew  and doing what Steve tells me to do."  </P> <P> Land is where Magers is at her best -- no matter what the surface.  </P> <P> She has reached the quarterfinals of Grand Slam events on three different  surfaces -- 1982 U.S. Open (hard court), the French (clay) and Wimbledon  (grass).  </P> <P> She excels in no one facet but has no great weaknesses, either.  </P> <P> Magers has risen steadily through the rankings this year, starting at 41 and  reaching 33 after her Wimbledon performance, her highest since she was 28th as  an amateur in July 1983. She entered play this week ranked 36th and with yearly  earnings of $107,441, having already exceeded her record $96,160 of last year.  </P> <P> By these measures, she is having her best year as a pro. But Magers strives for  more. She wants a shot that will strike fear into her opponents, like Steffi  Graf has with her powerful forehand.  </P> <P> "I've never really had a big shot other than when my serve is on and just being  quick," Magers said.  </P> <P> That is the edge she said she needs to make a big jump in the rankings and  reach the level where she contend more consistently. In three years as a pro,  Magers has two tournament titles -- 1987 in Auckland, New Zealand, and 1988 in  Schenectady, N.Y. Her best finish this year was again in Schenectady last week  -- a 6-4, 6-3 semifinal loss to Laura Gildemeister.  </P> <P> Magers said that because months and sometimes years between tournament  victories can be discouraging, it is important to get the most out of the  near-victories.  </P> <P> That is why the success of the past few months has infused her with renewed  dedication.  </P> <P> "I have been very fortunate to have good results spaced out," Magers said.  "Just when I'm about to get discouraged, I get a good win. It has taught me to  hang in there. Something good might be around the corner, right when you are  about to quit."  </P> <P> Magers is hardly at the end of her career, but there is always time for  reflection. Her immediate plans are clear -- play tennis and live in San Diego  for another year while Stephen finishes his work at SDSU. After that, much may  depend on Stephen's plans. SDSU does not offer a doctoral program in his field,  so if he continues his studies, it might require a move back to the University  of Texas in Austin.  </P> <P> Magers said the two have an understanding that while he is in school, her  tennis will pay the bills. But Magers said she looks forward to the time when  she can stay at home and let Stephen go off to work.  </P> <P> "We understand that this is the way it is for right now," Magers said. "I'm  really going to enjoy those days when he is working, and I am staying at home,  going biking all the time, doing what I want to do. I am looking forward to  those days."  </P> <P> But will those days include the Gypsy Lady?  </P> <P> "Hopefully," Magers said, smiling, "we will get a house and have a smaller  boat, and it will be more of a hobby."  </P></p>

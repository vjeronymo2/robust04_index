			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Waste legislation that dealers want dumped: The proposed disposal laws that present a threat to a valued activity MR MICK Nichols grew up travelling on his family's rag-and-bone cart. Now in his fifties, he continues to ply his father's trade - although his horse has been replaced by a van - and his livelihood is now threatened by the most modern of political phenomena - a battle over new environmental legislation. The Department of the Environment is due to announce early in June a wide-ranging package of legislation covering waste disposal which would force scrap dealers to pay for new licences and register all material handled by their yards. Although the legislation was planned for April, its introduction has been delayed - a move that reflects not only the increasing confusion over the implementation of European Community directives, but also the widespread protests from the scrap industry. The issue at stake is whether scrap should be defined as waste. Until now the Department of Environment has assumed that scrap should be so defined, with the result that local authorities across the country have treated scrap dealers in accordance with waste disposal regulations. The department said: 'These new regulations are basically being introduced to ensure that we have the highest environmental standards.' The scrap industry insists, however, that designating scrap as waste is misconceived. Instead, it says that dealers such as Mr Nichols play a vital part in the recycling of metals, and their work should be recognised for its environmental benefits. Mr John Clubb, director of the British Scrap Federation, said: 'We are not whingeing - we are prepared to accept regulations. But these regulations will hit us and hurt the environment.' He points out that at present local authorities vary greatly in their interpretation of the existing legislation. Mr Clubb believes that forcing scrap dealers to pay for new licences and keep inventories will not only force many of the smaller dealers to close, but also discourage them from dealing with difficult items. The federation says scrap dealers handle about 2m vehicles and 5m household appliances such as washing machines, freezers and cookers a year. Mr Clubb added: 'When the public sees a filthy old scrapyard, they don't realise that it does a job which helps the environment. Where else are you going to dump your old fridge?' Nevertheless, as the federation admits, the industry faces a difficult problem in changing its public image, not least because of high- and low-tech methods of scrap recycling. The federation estimates that there are 300 large dealers operating in Britain. In 1991 these produced about 8.5m tonnes of recycled steel, together with a smaller - but more valuable - quantity of non-ferrous material. Slightly less than half of the steel was exported, of which 53 per cent was sent to EC countries, primarily Spain. The largest dealers, such as Coopers Metals, which has an annual turnover of about Pounds 200m, stress that their side of the business is highly modernised. But these larger dealers are themselves dependent on an estimated 9,000 smaller collectors and traders, who collect different scrap materials which large dealers believe would be uneconomic to collect. To a casual observer the methods of small collectors seem to represent a distasteful side of the business. For while some former rag-and-bone families have replaced their horses with vans, others are using ever more basic methods, scavenging in rubbish tips with their bare hands. One such London based collector, known as 'Spectacles', has spent the past 20 years trawling skips for old wires and metals which he crams into a hand trolley and sells to scrap dealers. On a good day, when the skips are full and the site managers generous, he makes about Pounds 10. 'Gun metal is the best - you get good prices for that. Then zinc or aluminium,' he explained. 'But iron's the worst because no one wants it. The price has fallen right low.' The scrap wire he collects is sold on to a local scrap metal yard which cleans and strips it and then sells it on to re-finers. According to HP Dicks, one of these refiners, most of the aluminium is then exported, with the lead going to British factories that manufacture batteries. Most of the scrap steel is refined in the UK. The larger dealers insist that itinerants present an out-dated picture of the business. Nevertheless, with their numbers apparently growing, swelled by the young homeless, the rag-and-bone image seems set to dog the industry  -and the forthcoming legislation - for a long time.</p>

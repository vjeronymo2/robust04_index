			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SON'S LAWSUIT AGAINST SOL PRICE IS THROWN OUT  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge Arthur W. Jones on Wednesday threw out the $100-million  emotional-distress lawsuit filed against multimillionaire Sol Price by his  estranged son, Laurence, who claimed that his father was cruel, cold and  domineering.  </P> <P> After seven days of trial and bitter, searingly personal testimony, Jones said  that Sol Price, 73, had been "reasonable" in the raising of Laurence, 43, who,  evidence showed, was a difficult child and still has serious emotional  problems.  </P> <P> Laurence had claimed that he was deeply hurt when his father refused to attend  a bar mitzvah party -- a key issue in the case -- but Jones ruled that Sol  Price had a First Amendment right not to go.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No 'Outrageous' Acts  </P> <P> The dismissal came after Laurence's lawyer, Marvin Mitchelson, rested his case.  Jones ruled that Mitchelson had shown no evidence that Sol Price had committed  any "outrageous" acts and, therefore, there were no issues for the jury to  consider.  </P> <P> Later, Gerald McMahon, Sol Price's lawyer, announced that Price had decided to  drop his counterclaim for $2.2 million in loans for which his son had failed to  repay him.  </P> <P> At issue in the ruling was an incident that occurred Jan. 24, 1987, when Sol  Price arrived a few minutes late for the bar mitzvah of his grandson Benjamin,  Laurence's child. Sol Price stayed in the back of the hall during the ceremony  and did not attend the party afterward.  </P> <P> The incident, a relatively minor event in the stormy history of one of  California's wealthiest families, emerged this week as the crux of a novel  lawsuit brought by Laurence Price. He claimed that the behavior of his father,  founder of the Price Club discount warehouses, caused him such severe emotional  distress that he should be awarded $100 million in damages.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Nothing Else to Say'  </P> <P> "It was a personal matter. It never should have been in court," Sol Price said  Wednesday, his eyes brimming with tears. "There's nothing else to say."  </P> <P> A few yards away, his son chatted with reporters and declared himself the  winner because now "it was out and people knew it, and my family knew it, and  they heard it from other people -- the truth about what happened with the kids,  about what my father has done. That's a victory." He said he thinks it unlikely  that the family rift can be healed anytime soon.  </P> <P> The question of whether such family disputes should be decided by the courts  was at the center of Jones' ruling Wednesday. A difference of opinion over  "social graces really should not be the subject of a legal action," Jones said.  </P> <P> Mitchelson, who set a precedent with the first successful "palimony" case a  decade ago, said the Price litigation was a "cutting-edge case" because few  emotional-distress cases are brought against family members. "We feel there are  certain rights of children to sue their parents under these circumstances," he  said. Mitchelson said no decision has been made on whether to file an appeal.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Suit Filed in 1987  </P> <P> Laurence Price filed the lawsuit, alleging intentional and negligent infliction  of emotional distress, on Dec. 1, 1987, after losing a legal battle to retain  leases for lucrative tire-installation centers attached to the Price Club  discount warehouses his father started in 1976. Sol Price had arranged for  Laurence to own and operate the centers in 1978 after Laurence, a high school  dropout, had been out of work for two years.  </P> <P> Sol Price and other officials of the Price Club testified that they decided to  cancel Laurence's leases for the business, worth about $3.7 million, because he  was mismanaging it and was extremely difficult to deal with, even on the most  routine business matters.  </P> <P> But, in testimony, Laurence Price claimed that his father ordered the leases  canceled because he would not accede to his father's demand that he return his  two sons to their mother, who had won custody in a divorce proceeding. During  the seven days of trial this month, Laurence alleged that his father had always  been cold and cruel.  </P> <P> A psychologist testified that Laurence was so disturbed by his father's  behavior that he could commit suicide.  </P> <P> Laurence also complained of other incidents over the years that he believed  were attempts by his father to inflict pain on him and alienate him from his  sons. Once, he said, his father took his son Jonas on a trip to see the campus  of Stanford University without notifying Laurence, and the father helped Jonas  buy a car without consulting him, Laurence said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Statute of Limitations  </P> <P> However, the only action that occurred within the year before the filing of the  suit was the bar mitzvah incident, making it the only incident covered by  California's statute of limitations on emotional-distress claims.  </P> <P> In his ruling Wednesday, Jones said that, far from being cruel, Sol Price had  taken a "reasonable" approach to the raising of his emotionally troubled son.  Sol Price had tried "the soft line, the hard line and the middle line," Jones  said. "You get into the considerations, 'Am I indulgent enough or too  indulgent?' There are no answers to these questions."  </P> <P> After the decision Wednesday, McMahon told reporters that Sol Price and his  wife, Helen, "didn't want to be here in the first place. We tried in many ways  and on many occasions to resolve this matter. He (Sol) could have foreseen the  outcome and wanted to protect Larry from it."  </P> <P> Evidence at the trial showed that Sol Price had helped Laurence financially  with loans and gifts for most of his lifetime. Nevertheless, the two rarely got  along.  </P> <P> Sol Price testified that he believes he "spoiled" Laurence and that he bears  the blame for his son's behavior.  </P> <P> "I think Larry feels that the world owes him a living," Sol Price testified.  "He certainly is a person who wants a lot of benefits and no burdens. I think  he's spoiled."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Several Jurors Sympathetic  </P> <P> Several of the jurors expressed sympathy for Laurence Price in interviews  Wednesday, but said they were unsure how they would have voted.  </P> <P> "I felt sorry for Laurence, but not that sorry," said Julia L. James, an  instructional aide at El Cajon High School. "I think he could have been more  conciliatory. I felt that, if Laurence had wanted to, and felt a little empathy  for his dad, they could probably have gotten together."  </P> <P> Of Sol Price, she said: "He was the tough old patriarch of the family. He had  the money, he had the business, but, golly, he has feelings too."  </P> <P> Ruth Romo-Dutra, another juror, said she did not know what her decision might  have been because the jury had not yet been instructed in the applicable law.  However, she said: "I feel really sorry for Larry. I think he's a wonderful  person. . . . I think he was deprived of the thing he needed most -- love and  affection."  </P> <P> Juror Lynda L. Breunig said she took an informal poll after the case was thrown  out Wednesday and found that "there was an awful lot of emotion for Larry."  </P> <P> However, she said: "The main thread that was running through the opinions I got  was that there wasn't enough there to make an award of that amount."  </P></p>

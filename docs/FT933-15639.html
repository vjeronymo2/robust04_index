			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Amnesty says abuses worsening THE TURMOIL which replaced the iron hand of Communist rule in parts of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union brought with it severe human rights violations last year, Amnesty International said in a report released today, Reuter reports from London. The pressure group said in its annual world report that 1992 'was an appalling year for human rights in Europe'. Right around the globe, killings, torture and ill-treatment persisted with few signs of improvement, it found, with 'governments continuing to put politics before people's lives'. The London-based organisation said: 'There are thousands of stories in this 350-page report of people whose lives have been destroyed by state persecution and injustice.' Amnesty said it feared the first United Nations human rights conference for 25 years, held in Vienna last month, would do little to help victims. 'When we compare the fine speeches and final document with the damning evidence of political repression in this report, it is clear governments have yet to prove the world conference will make a difference to the lives of people around the world.' During 1992 prisoners of conscience were held in at least 62 countries, police in more than 110 states used torture and 45 governments killed opponents and 'troublemakers' for political reasons. Listing gross violations, it said conflict brought carnage and appalling abuses in ex-Yugoslavia and Somalia and killings and mass arrests in Egypt, Algeria and Israel. 'In a largely unreported civil war in Tajikistan, officials estimated that 20,000 people had died by the end of 1992 and unarmed civilians were deliberately killed,' it said.</p>

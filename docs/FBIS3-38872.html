			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Phillip Johnston, political correspondent, and Richard </F> Savill in Belfast: "Ulster Peace Ideas To Be Kept Secret"]    [Text] Proposals aimed at pushing forward the search for a  political settlement in Northern Ireland are to remain secret  while ground for possible agreement is explored, it emerged last  night.    Senior Government sources said the three parties involved in  bilateral talks would be given an assessment of them in the next  10 days. But they will amount to "thoughts" rather than a  blueprint for action and will not be published.    Last week, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland Secretary,  disclosed he intended to "float" ideas for devolving powers to  the province and setting up cross-border policy groups to  demonstrate that the political process was not waiting upon an  answer from Sinn Fein and the IRA to the Downing Street  declaration.    The proposals, thought to include a new assembly for  Northern  Ireland, are aimed at giving "focus and direction" to the debate.    It is hoped that Sinn Fein will accept the declaration as a  basis for entering the democratic process. But it was stressed  in Whitehall last night that they would not be able to unravel  any agreements made once talks between the Government and the  various parties have resumed on the new basis. A "taking stock"  meeting Between Mr Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, Ireland's Prime  Minister, will take place in London on Feb 19, some two months  after the declaration was signed.    Speaking in Dublin yesterday Mr Reynolds said that an early  commitment to peace was now the test of true Irish patriotism.  He warned republicans that the nationalist community as a whole  stood to suffer most and risked losing ground if the declaration  was rejected and IRA violence continued.    The time for a decision on peace was approaching, he said.  "Nobody should succumb to the dangerous illusion that there is  much more that can be offered at this stage of the peace  process. Democratic governments will not be influenced by the  threat of continued violence."    The Sinn Fein annual conference at the end of the month is  increasingly being seen as a watershed for the Republicans. Mr  Dick Spring, Irish Foreign Minister, said there were no fixed  deadlines for a response but the conference seemed "a date of  importance."    Sir Patrick, speaking in Londonderry, said the Government  was  prepared to move to the next stage without Sinn Fein or Mr Ian  Paisley's Democratic Unionist Party, which has boycotted recent  discussions because of its opposition to the Downing Street  declaration.</p>

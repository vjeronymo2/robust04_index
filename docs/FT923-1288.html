			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Mellor battles to save career MR DAVID MELLOR last night launched a last-ditch attempt to save his political career after senior Conservatives signalled they would meet today to consider his future in the cabinet. In an unprecedented series of television interviews the heritage secretary strongly denied allegations of impropriety in accepting hospitality from wealthy personal friends. He said that his future as a minister had now developed into a power struggle between Mr John Major and the editors of some tabloid newspapers over who should decide the composition of the cabinet. In spite of growing unease within his party that Mr Mellor's position had become untenable, Mr Major indicated that the minister retained his full confidence. The prime minister wrote to Mr Bryan Gould, the shadow heritage secretary, rejecting any suggestion that Mr Mellor had acted improperly in accepting a paid holiday in the summer of 1990 from Mrs Mona Bauwens, daughter of a prominent Palestine Liberation Organisation member. Mr Major said Mr Mellor's decision not to refer the matter to the then prime minister was 'entirely consistent' with official guidance. Earlier this week a High Court jury failed to deliver a verdict on whether Mrs Bauwens had been libelled by a newspaper article about the holiday, which coincided with the PLO's support for the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Mr Mellor, whose position in the cabinet was undermined earlier in the summer by revelations about his personal relationship with an actress, last night claimed he was the victim of a tabloid campaign of vilification. He insisted he would remain in office as long as he retained the confidence of the prime minister and the Conservative party. The heritage secretary rejected any suggestion that he had broken ministerial rules. But his spirited and extraordinary defence did not dispel the doubts among senior Conservative MPs over whether he can survive in the cabinet. The executive of the powerful 1922 Committee of Tory MPs will consider Mr Mellor's future when the House of Commons reconvenes today for an emergency debate on the economy. Some members of the executive indicated last night that they believed Mr Mellor's position had become an embarrassment to the prime minister and the Conservative party and that he should resign. They refused to predict the outcome of today's meeting.</p>

			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Head of opera house criticised AN ARTS COUNCIL report being prepared on London's Royal Opera House is understood to be critical of Mr Jeremy Isaacs, the general director, and his management style. Arts Council reports are usually uncontroversial and avoid naming personalities, so the apparent criticism of Mr Isaacs is unexpected. Reports at the weekend suggested that the preliminary findings of a wide-ranging review of the Covent Garden site, chaired by Baroness Warnock, were that the Royal Opera House was run 'with incredible amateurism and all the precision of a school choir'. The source of the reports was not named and members of Lady Warnock's committee denied any involvement. The reports suggested that if the financial situation at the opera house did not improve 'the only thing to do is shut it down and start again'. The report from Lady Warnock's committee is one of the periodic assessments of its clients ordered by the Arts Council, which this year is giving the three companies linked to Covent Garden - the Royal Opera, the Royal Ballet, and Birmingham Royal Ballet - a total subsidy of Pounds 18.9m. The final report, which has yet to be compiled, is due to be delivered in time for the Arts Council's meeting next month. It will be passed on to Covent Garden, which can publish it if it wishes. Mr Isaacs' five-year term as director ends in the autumn of next year. In recent months he has improved the opera house's creative reputation, but falls in box-office revenue and sponsorship income as a result of the recession have blocked his ambition to cut the Pounds 3.3m deficit this year. Mr Isaacs would like to renew his contract but his combative personality has made him enemies. The criticism may encourage the opera house board to rally round and announce his reappointment.</p>

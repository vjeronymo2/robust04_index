They Called Out in Russia, They  Responded Everywhere, in Ukraine Too. For the Elections Are  Close at Hand"]    [Text] Kiev-Moscow-Kiev--With assistance from the  "East-East" program and the international Restoration fund, I  was in Moscow on 12 December and the night before, and I can  attest to the fact that if fascism or revisionism came to power  there, it was surprisingly quietly. Or, as the observant poet  would say, to the sound of snow falling on Moscow streets,  transforming certain of them, uncleaned probably since the  beginning of perestroyka, into an impassable muddy quagmire. It  is as though the white snow covered up the surface with a  calming shroud, but the next minute everything clumsy and  uncouth, nasty and disfigured, could be seen clearly through it.  Just as the real free elections showed how much darkness there  is in the souls of Russians and in the attitudes of decent  citizens and what they can say when there is nobody standing  behind them, watching them....    The night before the "great day," only the Russian  anarchists gathered, following tradition, in front of the  monument to Pushkin; they rallied, and they handed out to  passersby appeals that clearly "cast down" a plague on all  Russian political houses: "The December elections will do  nothing for us; they will merely legalize the dictatorship of  the apparatchiks and the new rich speculators. But today's  `communist,' nationalist, and `democratic' opposition is no  better. The struggle among the politicians is not for freedom  and democracy, but for power, for the right to grab more, to  decide which of them will plunder and steal....but if everyone  has already understood that no elections or referendums will  change anything--do not go to the elections, do not  vote--resist!... The parties are fighting to control the people;  we are for having the people control themselves!"    But the Russians did go to the polls, the elections did  take place, and their results, in my opinion, are of  significance for all former Union republics where elections are  still to be held and particularly, of course, for Ukraine.  <H5>  First Lesson: Zhirinovskiy Did Not Win--the Democrats Lost </H5>   Even Leon Trotsky called Hitler's Fascist Party a "party of  counterrevolutionary despair," because the brownshirts came to  power using populist slogans as, incidentally, the Bolsheviks  also once did, playing on the atmosphere of government  instability and attitudes of no confidence either in the present  or in the future on the part of the majority of simple citizens.  Vladimir Volfovich's political formula was also simple: If you  want power, press on the sore spots, on the "pet corns" of the  Russians, who are suffering from nervous exhaustion, promise  them a "great Russia" and expose their "traitors" and enemies.  And it is desirable to do this frequently, persistently, and  simply enough for a moron to understand.    Zhirinovskiy did this. And today it is not so important that  even before the session of the State Duma he abandoned the  majority of his propositions. The magic of simple-calming,  optimistic-encouraging words had done its work.    I was told about the following episode at an election  precinct. One young person was asking another: "Who did you vote  for?" "For Zhirinovskiy," was the answer. "What do you  mean?!"--the first one was surprised, making a gesture as though  the other were crazy. "And why not, look at what this will do to  the country," the second one defended his position. And this is  instructive: Zhirinovskiy was operating in a strange mixture of  hope and hopelessness, belief in the possibility of change and  disbelief in the idea that any of the current leaders would do  anything real.    And the Russian democrats? They, unfortunately, as we know,  were unable to join together. Possibly in fact they, as Gaydar  said, are capable of doing this only two hours before the  shooting starts, but this is the most important lesson for  Ukrainian reformers: They need unity.    I returned to Kiev with a Ukrainian businessman who has an  office and a firm in Berlin, works through Moscow, and expects  Kiev to provide stability and certainty. He explained the  Russian situation to me in his own way: "If you need a razor to  shave, you go to the store. And if you see many good razors  there but they are all of the same kind, differing only in  appearance, you might not choose any of them but buy one  somewhere where the selection is simple but there is only one  choice." Thus the esteemed democrat reformers "a la Ukraine" as  we already know today are offering us a diversity of political  views with various nuances. The main mistake of the Russian  democrats was in tactics: Along with their personal ambitions,  they were counting on the idea that by separating they could  offer the voters various versions of the democratic option  (thus, if Gaydar does not suit you--vote for Shakhray or  Yavlinskiy), but the voters demanded clarity. The democrats of  Russia did not take into account the low level of political  sophistication of the electorate.    And there is one more thing which, in my view, requires no  commentary. Even on the day before the elections, the executive  committee of Russia's Choice wrote: "It is already possible to  sum up certain results of the brief but noisy campaign  (election--V.S.). It is obvious to everyone that it took place  according to the pattern of '12 against one.' One was the  Russia's Choice bloc and 12--the other participants in the  political race. ....The methods of the battle between the  `people's defenders' and the `strict reformers' was the same as  before: accusations bursting from the television screens but not  confirmed by anything, insidious hints anonymously released to  the mass media, appeals to the very worst instincts." And so,  esteemed participants in the Ukrainian race, if you really  believe that Ukraine needs reforms, agree on which specific ones  and allow as little ambition and underhandedness as possible and  encourage as much analysis and tolerance as possible.  <H5>  The Second Lesson: Reforms Are Needed in Any Case </H5>   The strangest phenomenon in Ukraine after the elections in  Russia might be the appearance of attitudes indicating something  like this: You see where the Russian reforms led--first of all,  the people were impoverished and then, against this background,  the fascists came to power. Of course, such assertions make a  certain amount of sense. But on the other hand: Have the people  in Ukraine been any less impoverished? Probably much more so;  our standard of living is considerably lower than the Russians'.  And herein lies the basic and principal distinction between the  Russian and Ukrainian situations. "Gaydareconomics," which is  based on "shock therapy," actually did lower the standard of  living of the people, but it launched the reforms and so it gave  them a light at the end of the tunnel, namely--hope of  improvement.    But in Ukraine the standard of living has declined without  any reforms. The external appearance of reforms has frequently  even discredited the very idea of reforms when they are  discussed, and property is being quietly stolen under a barrage  of verbiage. But this kind of "reform Ukrainian-style" should in  no way deter the future political elite from reforms. The only  thing that can really be learned from the Russian experience, in  my opinion, is this formula: as little shock as possible and as  much therapy as possible. If, of course, this is possible under  our present conditions. And our voters too must make a certain  choice and not make a mistake. For we too could have our own  Zhirinovskiy. But he would capitalize not on the idea of a  "great Ukraine" but on the need to impose order with a strong  hand. Both orthodox and turncoat communist-socialists of Ukraine  fit this role better than others.  <H3>  The Third Lesson: If You Help the Democrat, You Will Have To  Deal With His Opposite </H3>   In Ukraine people have been saying frequently that it is  necessary to join forces with real Russian democrats because,  they say, herein lies the guarantee of our independence. And  even based on Vinnichenko's definition of the Russian democrat,  which ends where Ukrainian independence begins, this assertion  has been true. It seems to me that perhaps we should have been  more oriented toward Russian pragmatists, but we had to find  political partners among those who, because of various  convictions, have recognized Ukraine's uniqueness to one degree  or another. And this had to be done persistently and concretely.  Then we would not have had today's deficit of the  Ukrainian-Russian trade balance, which is not in favor of  Ukraine, such an immense amount of indebtedness, and such a lack  of regulation of the mechanism for mutual settlements. But, as  our president says, we have what we have.    But joint actions among democrats will become considerably  more crucial after these elections. Because the Russian  Government will inevitably have to take into account the  attitudes of the political forces represented in the State Duma  of Russia. And we know what Zhirinovskiy, Zyuganov, et al think  about Ukraine, so economic and political pressure on Ukraine  will increase. Therefore, official Kiev must prepare for this  even today and in some way or another be concerned about how we  will pay for Russian energy sources in January. I personally  would be in favor of reforms, freedom of the producer, free  exports, which would provide the necessary freely convertible  currency, concrete negotiations with Russia, and a business  alliance with its healthy political forces. But I am a  journalist, and our leadership, perhaps, has learned different  lessons....</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Three ministers of the Rwandan Government and three  UN military observers have been taken hostage by members of the  Presidential Guard. A UN official says that three of the  observers were abducted this morning from their residence, along  with the three ministers and their families. The situation is  extremely tense in the two countries following the attack in  which the Rwandan and Burundi presidents were killed. The  authorities of the two countries have stepped up their calls for  calm and called on their armed forces to contribute to  maintaining order. The radio stations are broadcasting messages  alternating with classical music. The French servicemen have  been put on alert in the Central African Republic.</p>

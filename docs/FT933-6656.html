			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / UK Company News: New Pounds 135m reinsurance group underlines interest in sector BARCLAYS DE Zoete Wedd is organising finances for a new Sydney-based reinsurance company in a move reflecting growing investor interest in the market for catastrophe reinsurance. Reinsurance Australia Corporation is expected to have capital of ADollars 300m (Pounds 135m) and will be headed by Mr Michael Kelly, a senior London underwriter currently with Kemper Re (UK). Five leading Australian pension funds and life insurance companies are investing in REAC, which may be floated on the Australian stock exchange within the next 12 months. A further ADollars 200m could be raised to support the new venture's growth. The company will underwrite a worldwide account of property excess of loss business and will aim to be a market leader. Mr Kelly said the 'time was right' to launch the new company, which has been under consideration for two years. He believes further rises in rates are likely when insurers renew annual reinsurance programmes later this year and said that the new influx of capacity will not lead to any resumption of rate competition. It is the latest in a wave of new ventures formed this year following sizeable rate rises since 1990, a shrinkage of capacity in traditional markets, especially in London, and a strong revival in the sector's profitability. Investors, mainly from the US, are ploughing more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) into Bermuda, the centre of most recent activity, where at least five new ventures have been formed in recent weeks. Two new companies have also been formed in London, following initiatives by NAC Re and Liberty Mutual. It has also emerged this week that another specialist London-based reinsurer is to be set up by the Benfield Group, an independent insurance broker. It is understood that the new venture is aiming to have paid-up capital of Pounds 50m, writing about Pounds 100m premium income in its first year. The prospect of rising rates is also leading a number of UK and US banks and securities houses to examine investment in the Lloyd's of London insurance market which is currently opening its doors to corporate capital.</p>

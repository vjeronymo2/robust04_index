			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / North American Free Trade Agreement: Sector's political sensitivity dictates protection levels - Agriculture AGRICULTURE is perhaps the most politically sensitive sector in all three North American countries, with each seeking to maintain protection levels for key areas, write Damian Fraser and Bernard Simon. The Americans have successfully gained 15-year transition periods for what powerful US farm lobbyists consider their most vulnerable crops, including sugar, citrus and other fruits and vegetables. The Mexicans have agreed to eliminate import licences, which covered 25 per cent of US agricultural exports last year. However, they have acquired a 15-year grace period for corn, beans and powdered milk. Under the treaty Mexico has been promised free sugar exports to the US after 15 years - a significant concession given the current level of protection for the US sugar industry. In the first six years Mexico will be granted either its current quota of 7,258 metric tonnes, or the difference between Mexico's production and consumption, up to a maximum of 25,000 tonnes. After year seven this limit will be increased to 150,000 tonnes, increasing by 10 per cent a year for the next eight years. All export limits will be eliminated if Mexico is a net exporter for two consecutive years. Mexico is now a net importer. In corn (maize) Mexico has achieved a similar deal. It will let in, duty-free, a quota of 2.5m tonnes in the first year, growing by 3 per cent a year over the next 15 years. At the same time tariffs on non-quota corn will start at more than 200 per cent and gradually fall over the 15 years. Similar arrangements govern Mexico's imports of milk and beans. The corn sector employs more than 2m Mexicans, most of whom are desperately poor. Nevertheless, the government has long maintained that the current method of protection - through import restrictions and artificially high prices - is inefficient, since it benefits the few rich farmers more than the poorer ones. The Mexican government is likely to announce soon a targeted subsidy programme, where money will be directed almost exclusively at the poorest corn farmers. Under Nafta Canada will be allowed to retain the non-tariff protection enjoyed by its dairy, poultry and egg producers. This consists of production quotas and subsidies, together with import quotas. The 'supply-management' system is coming under increasing pressure, however, as local food processors and Canada's trading partners push for the import barriers to be lowered.</p>

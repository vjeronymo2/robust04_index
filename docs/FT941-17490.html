			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Observer: Chips to Moscow Carlo de Benedetti, the Olivetti chairman, has been banging on for ages about the company's move out of manufacturing into more profitable computer-related services. But Olivetti's latest deal, worth about L26bn - helping re-educate officers of the Russian armed forces for civvy street - seems a radical move even for him. Olivetti won the contract from the European Commission. Along with German and French partners it will provide management training to about 16,000 of the 200,000-odd Russian officers deemed to be surplus to requirements since the Berlin Wall came down. Some of the demobbed will even be shipped to Europe for six months, to see western business at first hand. De Benedetti's business savvy is justly renowned. Competitors are thus asking themselves whether Olivetti's latest venture reflects hopes of acquiring potential new staff, or is just a useful bit of advance networking for future Russian sales.</p>

			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Management: Time to re-engineer the manager - Now it's the boss's turn to be shaken up by the latest business theory Senior managers have been re-engineering business processes with a passion, tearing down corporate structures that no longer can support the organisation. Yet the practice of management has largely escaped demolition. If their jobs and styles are left largely intact, managers will eventually undermine the very structure of their rebuilt enterprises. The work of managers in a re-engineered organisation must change as much as the work of workers. Radical changes in the tasks of workers and the organisation of their work - the operational processes for filing orders, serving customers after the sale, developing new products, and the like - demand concurrent changes in management processes, such as the roles, styles, reward systems and other 'tools' used by managers to run their organisation. For the past four years, I and other consultants have been re-engineering the operational processes of our clients. But we have paid little attention to their management processes. We now understand that managers must remake three aspects of their jobs to keep their re-engineered operational processes structurally sound: Managerial roles. With the radical redefinition of work, the traditional boundaries between leaders, managers and workers are breaking down. As work becomes organised around core processes (for example, order fulfilment, product development, materials acquisition), two results occur: workers add real customer value, and they are increasingly self-managed. That puts the fundamental role of management into question. I recently visited a company that had structured its work around self-managed process teams. Managers were walking the halls asking: 'What is my job?' The answer is that it is nothing like the job they had before. No more close supervision of workers, no more focus on data irrelevant to running the business, no more energy spent on defending turf. The role of managers becomes one of empowerment - providing workers with the information, training, authority and accountability to excel in a re-engineered business process. One caution: this is not empowerment as traditionally advocated. Managers in a re-engineered organisation cannot relinquish all supervision in the belief that people will figure out their jobs and rise to the occasion. Work may be self-managed but it is not unmanaged. Instead, managers periodically must inspect the work, measure the performance of the process and its contributors, and coach the workers to even better performance. As workers take on more management tasks, managers must take on more leadership tasks - holding a vision for the business, articulating it to workers and customers, and creating an environment that truly empowers workers. This is a tough transition for managers used to being the 'managerial glue' that held their balkanised organisations together. Managerial styles. Shedding the traditional 'command and control' model for one of 'lead and enable' is proving a difficult transition for most managers. Many continue to bark orders and micro-manage people in whom they have vested new decision-making authority. I can count on one hand the number of executives who have adopted a new style of empowerment. Managerial decision-making style must soften, remaining open to finding solutions to seeming paradoxes and contradictions. The tasks and activities in a re-engineered business are much more interrelated. Decisions can no longer be made independently by old functional leaders without regard to the related activities in the same business process. In this new team environment, behavioural knowledge and skills become crucial. Successful managers will be masters at getting people to work effectively together, managing conflict and being effective coaches. Knowledge of the content of the job is no longer the overriding requisite for promotion. Management systems. As work becomes self-managed, executives will need new 'tools' - performance measures, incentives, hiring and training systems - for steering the ship. In any empowered organisation, what is important is what is measured. Measures must track people's contribution to their team, and the team's contribution to the success of the re-engineered process. With fewer job descriptions and less hierarchy, managers must change the fundamentals of career development and compensation. With people in jobs for longer, compensation must be based more on the skills and knowledge they acquire, not on their position on the organisation chart. Overall, managers must shift their focus from watching the numbers to measuring the performance of critical business processes. The new scorecard for managers should be process performance: what percentage of customers are we retaining? How fast are we filling orders? How many prospects are we converting to customers? A blinding focus on financials is to treat the symptoms of organisational distress, not the causes. I am often asked whether workers will be able to perform in their re-engineered jobs. When enabled and empowered, most of them can. The more serious question is whether managers can make the transition. The answer will determine whether it will take five or 50 years to reverse the errors of the industrial revolution. The author is president of CSC Consulting Group, which includes CSC Index.

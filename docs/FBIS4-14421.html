			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Kuznetsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow March 31 TASS -- "We finally come to realise  that separation of powers does not mean their confrontation,"  Ivan Rybkin, speaker of the State Duma, said on Thursday during  a meeting with marshal of the Polish Sejm, Jozef Oleksy. Rybkin  said that the drafting of a document on national concord is an  example of practical interaction of branches of power.    The speaker of the Lower House of the Federal Assembly  believes it would be naive to think that the present Duma will  be able to provide full legislative backing for transformations  in Russia. Nevertheless, it is possible to lay down the  groundwork for fruitful operation of the next composition of the  Lower House, he said.    Rybkin said some Russian MPs suggest that the term of the  present State Duma be extended for another four years. The  speaker of the Lower House said this can become possible only if  the process of national reconciliation develops successfully.  There is, above all, interaction between the president and the  parliament. "Then the people would be able to express their  will, which would be represented in a constitutional extention  of the Duma's powers," Rybkin said.    Dwelling on European interparliamentary ties, the speaker of  the State Duma expressed perplexity with the fact that Russia  has not yet been admitted into the Council of Europe as a  full-fledged member.    In his turn, the marshal of the Polish Sejm expressed  satisfaction with successfully developing cooperation between  Russian and Polish MPs and declared for its further widening.  Jozef Oleksy heads a delegation of members of the Polish Sejm  that arrived in Moscow at the invitation of the Duma. The  delegation includes representatives of the main factions of the  Polish Sejm.</p>

			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Italian voters warned of 'conquerors of power'. The Catholic Church yesterday issued a thinly veiled warning to Italians to avoid voting for media magnate Silvio Berlusconi and his Forza Italia movement in the March 27 elections, writes Robert Graham in Rome. A document from the Italian bishops' conference urged voters to be wary of 'conquerors of power'. The church has traditionally warned of the dangers of voting for communists and the left, and has also never concealed its distaste at the moral tone of Italian commercial television, mostly controlled by Mr Berlusconi. But yesterday's document appeared to be an implicit reference to the political ambitions of Mr Berlusconi and his electoral promises. No other politician in the campaign has so openly exposed his desire to run the next government. Monsignor Dionigi Tettamanzi, the bishops' conference secretary, explaining the document, reinforced the church's oblique criticism of Mr Berlusconi by saying that voters should judge electoral policies by their content not their form. Mr Berlusconi has been promising lower taxes and large-scale job-creation. Throughout the post-war era the church has thrown its considerable weight behind the governing Christian Democrat party. But with the DC's collapse, it can no longer call for a unified Catholic vote. Thus Mons Tettamanzi yesterday called for 'coherence' in the catholic vote - an elegant way of admitting voters face a difficult choice.</p>

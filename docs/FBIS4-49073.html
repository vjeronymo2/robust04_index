			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 25 April (XINHUA) -- The Propaganda  Department recently issued a circular urging propaganda  departments of all local CPC committees and press units to  persevere in promoting professional ethics among reporters.    The circular says: Economic crime offenders involved in a  grave case in which the Changcheng Company of Mechanical,  Electrical, Scientific, and Technological Industries in Beijing  illegally raised funds were given sentences in accordance with  the law. Meanwhile, reporters who received bribes and concocted  misleading public opinions for this illegal funding activity  were punished in accordance with the law. A small number of  reporters who could not resist monetary temptations compiled  fake stories aimed at confusing the public. As a result, they  severely disturbed the economic order and damaged the interests  of the state and the people. They also tarnished the reputation  of the party's papers. We should learn from this lesson and  further improve professional ethics among reporters.    The circular points out: Since the Third Plenary Session of  the 11th CPC Central Committee, China has achieved, under the  party's leadership, outstanding results in the press work and  made important contributions to the drive of reform, opening up,  and socialist modernization. The overall quality of our  reporters is good. Specially after the issuance of the circulars  concerning the bans on "paid journalism" and "buying and selling  of book numbers," the ill practices that are against the  professional ethics of the press and publications have been  curbed. We must treat the bans on "paid journalism" and "buying  and selling of book numbers" as well as the effort to improve  professional ethics among reporters as a long-term work and  persist in carrying it out. By using the above-mentioned case  as a negative example, we should launch a thoroughgoing campaign  to boost journalistic ethics and strengthen the construction of  the press.    The circular urges propaganda departments of all local CPC  committees and press units to conduct, in the light of the  guiding spirit of the national meeting on propaganda and  ideological work and local realities, an investigation on the  work of carrying out the "circular concerning strengthening the  construction of the professional ethics among the reporters"  issued by the Propaganda Department and the Press and  Publications Administration last year. Those who achieve good  results should be commended while those who continue the ill  practices of "paid journalism" should be severely dealt with.  It is necessary to organize reporters to conduct discussions on  the Changcheng Company case and draw lessons from it. In the  light of the characteristics of their work, press units should  formulate relevant regulations and systems to tighten  self-discipline and conscientiously accept public supervision.  It is necessary to energetically advocate the work style of the  reporters who go deep into the realities of life, who immerse  themselves among the masses, who maintain closed ties with the  people, and who work hard. We should commend collectives and  individuals who go down to the grass-roots units, who are honest  in performing their duties, who observe laws and disciples, and  who make outstanding contributions to the drive of reform,  opening, and modernization.</p>

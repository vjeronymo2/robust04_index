			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Pledges 'would cost Pounds 11.5bn' In the first two days of its annual conference Labour made commitments which will increase annual public spending by more than Pounds 11.5bn, according to the Conservatives. In contrast to the view at the Blackpool gathering that Labour has not made specific commitments, Tory researchers claimed they had already found Pounds 11.57bn worth of Labour spending pledges. Publishing its Labour Spendometer, the Conservative Research Department said it had totalled all spending promises made in conference motions that the National Executive Committee was supporting, and in speeches by frontbenchers during the first two days of the conference. The Tory document states that a fixed statutory minimum wage at half median male earnings - or just over Pounds 4 an hour - would add about Pounds 1.5bn a year to the public-sector pay bill. It did not refer to Mr Tony Blair's refusal to commit Labour to fixing a firm figure before the general election.</p>

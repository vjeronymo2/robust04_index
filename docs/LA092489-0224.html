			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> POMONA-PITZER STUMBLES OVER THE FEAT OF OCCIDENTAL'S LITTLE  </P> <P> A couple of feet proved to be the difference Saturday in Occidental College's  24-14 victory over Pomona-Pitzer.  </P> <P> First there was Pomona's failure to cash in one foot from the goal line in the  fourth quarter, which would have given the Sagehens the lead and momentum.  </P> <P> Next came Pomona kicker Robert Perez's failure to convert two fourth-quarter  field-goal attempts that were well within his range. And, in the end, there  were the ultra-quick feet of Occidental running back Gary Little, who rushed  for 215 yards in 24 carries in the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic  Conference opener at Pomona.  </P> <P> The win, Occidental's first after season-opening defeats to Menlo and Azusa  Pacific, gave the Tigers their 10th consecutive victory over Pomona, which had  been looking to avenge last season's 70-16 wipeout.  </P> <P> "If we had lost, there would have been some real, real concern in Eagle Rock,"  Occidental Coach Dale Widolff said. "I still don't think we're playing well . .  . but it's nice to get this first win."  </P> <P> Trailing, 14-10, at halftime, Occidental scored the winning touchdown on a  40-yard pass from Tony Werbelow to Rob Leinbach with 6:36 left in the third  quarter.  </P> <P> That touchdown set the stage for the game's turning point, which occurred after  Pomona took the ensuing kickoff and drove 80 yards to the Occidental one-foot  line.  </P> <P> On first and goal, Pomona quarterback Gregg Silver fumbled while attempting a  sneak into the end zone.  </P> <P> "They were going in for the score," said Occidental defensive lineman Brady  Dargan, who recovered the fumble at the one-yard line. "That really changed the  momentum."  </P> <P> Pomona had two more chances to at least tie the score, but Perez missed  field-goal tries from 36 and 21 yards on the Sagehens' next possessions. In  last week's 13-0 opening victory over Colorado College, Perez made kicks from  almost the same distances.  </P> <P> "We thought it would come right down to the special teams and that's what  happened," Pomona Coach Clarence Thomas said.  </P> <P> Little, a 5-foot-9, 171-pound freshman from San Francisco, went a long way  toward sealing the victory with a 49-yard touchdown run with 2:17 left. Little  also scored the first touchdown on a 28-yard run in the first quarter.  </P> <P> Little's performance overshadowed that of Pomona running back Chris Smith, a  freshman who followed last week's 142-yard effort with 191 yards in 29 carries  against Occidental. Smith's touchdown at the end of the first half came on a  spectacular 68-yard run during which he traversed from sideline to sideline.  </P></p>

			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Leading Article: Re-regulating investment MR ANTHONY Nelson, the Treasury minister responsible for the financial services industry, has acknowledged that changes are needed in the way the sector is regulated. He is adding his voice to a swelling chorus. Like almost all the figures who have offered their thoughts on this subject in recent weeks - including Mr Mick Newmarch of the Prudential, Lord Alexander of National Westminster Bank, and Mr Andrew Large of the Securities and Investments Board - Mr Nelson is better at diagnosis than at cure. He wants the interests of investors, rather than the financial industry, to be at the heart of the system. Yet he has also said there will be no wholesale change in the regulatory structure, and clearly wants to avoid fresh legislation. Can such a shift of the regulators' priorities be achieved without radical change? The current system muddles together four largely separate aims: the detection of fraud; the protection of consumers against unscrupulous selling practices; the prudential supervision of financial services business, to make sure they are financially strong enough to sustain the risks they are taking on; and the enforcement of 'fair dealing' in markets dominated by professional traders. Responsibility for enforcement has been divided among the SIB, a lower tier of Self-Regulating Organisations, a third tier of exchanges, and the Serious Fraud Office. And there has been a marked lack of leadership on precisely the issue that Mr Nelson identified, as a backbencher nearly seven years ago, as the most important one: the interests of the investing public. The current state of regulation is a huge improvement on what went before. Its biggest problems lie in the area that every country in the world finds difficult to regulate: the selling of financial products to retail investors. Strong enforcement A new approach to regulation must separate out the objectives that the current act muddles together. That means providing, in the first place, for strong enforcement of laws and regulations. This especially requires a serious attempt to seek and expose full-scale fraud. But it also means achieving a better record of enforcement in professional markets, where the attempt to bring the full weight of the criminal law to bear on traditional less-than-edifying practices has led to delay, confusion and - ultimately - injustice. Second, it means the creation of clear, straightforward consumer protection regulations, backed by a workable compensation scheme. Both the structure of supervision, and the compensation scheme, should be easily explicable to the general public, without creating a belief that risk has been abolished. And third, a new approach to regulating the industry requires light regulation of true inter-professional markets, coupled with simple prudential supervision. If that is what is needed, how should we deliver it? Pace Mr Newmarch, it is a pipedream to think that direct government regulation is the answer. A main reason for the current act was to get regulation out of civil servants' hands. Single-tier structure It is also mistaken to believe that imitating the US Securities and Exchange Commission offers an instant solution, since many of the UK's most intractable problems fall outside the SEC's remit. Still, there are some useful lessons to draw from the SEC. Its independence, the strength of its board, the quality of its staff are all worth learning from. It may only be possible to achieve those aims by creating a single-tier regulatory structure, one which unites the work currently being done by the SIB and the SROs. Simplicity, the need for a single point of contact for complaints, the desire to recruit the very highest calibre of staff all argue for a single institution. This body, a strengthened SIB, should organise itself not sector-by-sector, as the current SROs do, but issue-by-issue. It should apply the three priorities outlined above as three dimensions of policy, applied across the board. That means, for example, that it needs a proper enforcement director, to work in co-operation with the SFO, but also drawing on - as Lord Alexander has recommended - a system of civil penalties similar to that available to the SEC. On the retail side, the new SIB needs a private investor protection director, to work with the Office of Fair Trading and other similar government bodies. The task would be to focus on selling practices, regardless of the type of investment institution responsible and to put investors' interests first. Such an organisation would not be easy to run. But, by separating out the priorities of policy quite explicitly, it would have a better chance of achieving them. Mr Large and Mr Nelson should bend their minds to such fundamental issues. They will be amply repaid for the effort.</p>

			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> A group of current and former police employees has filed a $30-million federal  lawsuit against the City of Concord because a video camera was secretly placed  in the police station men's room. The department installed a hidden video  camera above a urinal in 1986, hoping to identify the person who clogged it  several times with toilet paper. Chief George Straka has called the  surveillance "bad judgment" and said no one ever viewed the tapes. The overflow  reportedly flooded a computer room and the chief's office on the floor below.  The restroom was open to the public but used primarily by police. The suit  accuses Straka and three commanders of invading the plaintiffs' privacy. It  asks that the city pay $1 million each to 26 officers and three civilian  employees who allegedly were watched by police cadets and filmed as they stood  at urinals.  </P></p>

The property rights exchange, which will be built in two  months in this south China economic center, will be under the  management of the city government.    Latest figures show that there are now 25 property rights  exchanges in China, with the first one formed in the early 1980s.    Chen Kaizhi, vice-mayor of the city, said that all  state-owned enterprises in the city will be transformed into  corporations in the next four or five years.    Except for a number of public utilities like transportation  and telecommunications systems, most of the state-owned  enterprises will take the form of stock companies, Chen added.    Chen also mentioned that in line with the reform of property  rights, the city will establish some state-owned asset  management companies to take charge of managing, transferring  and auction of the state-owned assets of state-owned enterprises.    Guangzhou now has more than 20,000 enterprises, more than  4,000 of which are involved in industrial production.    Official sources said that this move is partly aimed at  revitalizing some loss-making state-owned enterprises which have  been in the red a long time because of limitations on  transferring property rights.</p>

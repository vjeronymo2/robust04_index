			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Bank of Edinburgh to bid for building society MEMBERS of Heart of England, the 25th largest building society with assets of Pounds 1.1bn, may be offered a combination of cash and shares to endorse the takeover of the society by the Bank of Edinburgh. News of the proposed takeover, which involves Heart of England shedding mutual status and becoming a division of Bank of Edinburgh, emerged at the weekend after 15 months of negotiations. The move is the first-ever takeover of a British building society from outside the industry and will create a precedent for further takeovers. At least three other societies are known to have been in talks with possible purchasers. Mr Mike Travis, Heart of England chief executive, said yesterday: 'We believe the route we are taking will enable us to serve our members better and give us more flexibility, particularly for raising capital and funding, than staying mutual would do. We have considered mergers and flotations but we are not big enough for that.' He said that the society had received other informal approaches for takeovers, but the board had judged that Bank of Edinburgh offered the best opportunity. The bank was set up two years ago with Pounds 26m in capital from investors headed by a Scottish mutual life assurance group. Its aim is to take over small or medium-sized building societies but to allow them to continue as separate retail banking subsidiaries. Heart of England fits neatly into this pattern. It has a network of 50 branches and a customer base of 250,000. Last year it made pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.1m after bad debt provisions of Pounds 8.2m. Mr Ken Murray, chief executive of Bank of Edinburgh, said that the takeover would enable the society to offer its customers more services, including, probably, a high interest cheque book current account. He declined to comment on how Bank of Edinburgh proposes to overcome the stiff voting requirements for a building society takeover laid down in the 1986 Building Societies Act. Heart of England's 206,000 members will have to approve the deal at a special general meeting at which at least half the society's members must vote and three quarters of votes cast must be in favour. 'We are confident that we will get the approval of Heart of England members,' said Mr Ken Murray, chief executive of Bank of Edinburgh yesterday. He expected the vote to take place early in the new year. News of the negotiations leaked out before Bank of Edinburgh had finalied the terms it will offer Heart of England members, but Mr Murray said that shares in the company could be offered as well as cash. A cash distribution by the bank of even Pounds 150 to each member of the society seems unlikely unless the bank's investors are willing to put up a substantial amount of new money.</p>

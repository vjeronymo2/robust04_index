			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Growth forecast for north Scotland The north of Scotland is poised to pull out strongly from a belated recession, with economic growth expected to average 2.6 per cent a year over the next five years, a survey published yesterday says. The Fraser of Allander Institute, in a quarterly business survey for Highlands and Islands Enterprise, the development agency, says the growth will produce thousands of new jobs when a recent rise in business confidence is matched by private-sector investment in company start-ups and expansions. Mr Iain Robertson, chief executive of HIE Network, which groups the area's 10 local enterprise companies, said the network had triggered a number of projects. More than 1,000 business projects had been assisted and more than 2,900 jobs created or retained. There had been more than 400 business start-ups, record joint investment in community projects and a strong rise in training programme successes. Mr Robertson said that the Highlands and islands had been hit late by recession and was only now emerging from the aftermath. HIE Network Annual Report. Free. Tel 01463 234171.</p>

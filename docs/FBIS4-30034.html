The assembly also heard Finance Minister Ho Te to report on  behalf of the Compilation, Inspection, and Secretariat  Committees, which summarized the opinions of deputies on the two  drafts of the amended laws on companies and on private business  establishments. Secretariat Member Ly Tai Luan read the full  texts of the two draft amended laws. The assembly unanimously  passed the two draft amended laws. The promulgation of the  amended laws on companies and on private business establishments  is the answer to a number of newly arisen problems and will  ensure consistency in current legal stipulations.    In the afternoon, the assembly worked under the direction of  National Assembly Vice Chairman Dang Quan Thuy to pass the draft  law to amend a number of provisions of the Military Obligation  Law. The assembly heard National Defense Deputy Minister Dao  Dinh Luyen give a report on behalf of the Compilation,  Inspection, and Secretariat Committees summarizing the opinions  of deputies on the draft law.

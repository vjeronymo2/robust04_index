			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Weighting thin on the ground: Changes in civil service terms The abolition of the London weighting allowances paid to civil servants comes after a period in which most businesses have frozen the additional payments they make to staff working in the capital. The fall in demand for staff in the recession has put an end to the boom in London allowances, paid to workers such as nurses, police officers, bank and West End shop staff. In the 1980s allowances reached Pounds 3,000 or more a year for some London staff, to meet recruitment and retention needs. Allowances in most of the clearing banks have not increased since 1989 or 1990. The civil service has frozen allowances for most of its staff since 1988. BT has not reviewed allowances since 1991 and will not again until next year. Many employers are freezing or abolishing additional supplements brought in during the boom years. Businesses have increasingly taken a more targeted approach, paying premiums to attract workers to new locations such as Bristol. This is the approach which the civil service intends to follow with its new recruitment and retention allowance, aimed at specific groups in offices with recruitment difficulties. London First, the private-sector lobby group set up to promote the capital, is among the growing band of organisations that believe London allowances, which can add an extra Pounds 3,000 to an individual's annual pay, should be abolished. A report from its economic development team said in October: 'Institutionalised 'London weighting' payments provide a disincentive to retain jobs in the capital.' British Telecommunications is considering moving thousands of office jobs out of central London over the next few years. The relocation could save the company up to Pounds 44m in London weighting. Mr Alastair Hatchett of Incomes Data Services, the independent research organisation, said much of current practice on London allowances dated from the 1974 Pay Board report for civil servants. The board recommended London weighting allowances to ensure comparability of real earnings for people working in London and those working elsewhere. Following a survey of living costs, the board recommended a Pounds 400 allowance for an inner London zone extending up to four miles from Charing Cross and a Pounds 200 allowance for an outer zone covering the remaining London boroughs. The allowances were to be reviewed each year in line with indices published by the Department of Employment, which monitored relative changes to the cost of living in London. Mr Hatchett said these covered housing, travel, wear and tear and other costs. Publication of these figures ended in 1982, with the government arguing that an employer's ability to pay and not cost compensation should be the main determinant of geographical pay relativities. Since then private-sector employers and the government have made their own calculations. Employers still justify the need for the payments in terms of labour-market needs. BT said: 'BT sees London weighting as a market supplement to attract and retain staff and it has not increased the allowance recently as it has had no problems recruiting.' Bifu, the banking union, said employers felt they had a justification not to increase rates when they did not have recruitment problems. As to the future? Mr Hatchett said: 'I can see there is likely to be downward pressure on the market-related part of the allowance but compensating people for either the cost of living in London or travelling in to work is clearly still important to many workers.'  -------------------------------------------------             THE HIGHER COST OF LONDON  ------------------------------------------------- Fuel, light &amp; power                       105.1 Food                                      102.1 Alcoholic drink                            94.3 Tobacco                                   100.9 Clothing &amp; footwear                       100.9 Household goods                           101.4 Household services                        110.0 Personal goods &amp; services                 100.9 Motoring expenditure                      100.6 Fares &amp; other travel costs                100.6 Leisure goods                             100.9 Leisure services                          110.0 Miscellaneous                             102.7 Housing                                   129.7  ------------------------------------------------- TOTAL*                                    107.3  ------------------------------------------------- *Weighted according to expenditure of Londoners  ------------------------------------------------- Source: London First  -------------------------------------------------</p>

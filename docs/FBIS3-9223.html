An oversized, overorganized, and offensive army, a  former member of the Warsaw Treaty Organization, had to become a  defence force, he said.    In recent years, the 150,000-strong staff (including civil  employees) has shrunk by 33 percent. Simultaneously, the number  of army officers has been cut from 27,500 to 22,000, Fur said.    The minister said that the army, which used to be  concentrated in Transdanubia, had to be redeployed.    Airborne, rapid deployment units have been formed to meet  the  new kind of challenges Hungary has become exposed to, mainly by  the war in former Yugoslavia, he continued. There are now  national defence brigades and, in accord with NATO's peace  partnership scheme, will soon start training peacekeeping  forces, Fur said.    The Hungarian army used to be marked by an internationalist  spirit, but is now a national army, the minister said. Fur said  lack of funds holds up army technical development.</p>

President Clinton, in his State of the Union  Address to Congress, devoted a large portion of it to domestic  problems. In his State of the Union Address, President Clinton  made clear his administration's position that the foundation for  "reconstructing the United States" will be built through  domestic reform.    The State of the Union Address entitled "On the Present  Situation of the United States" is an annual report given by the  President to the American people. President Clinton's State of  the Union Address reflected very forthrightly the present  situation of the United States, and gave us a good impression.    The Clinton administration has met with many difficulties  since its inauguration. Looking back on what his administration  has done over the past year, we find some of its accomplishments  worthy of receiving high marks.    Among other things, we would like to point out that the U.S.  economy has steadily recovered ahead of Japan and European  nations. While the growth rate has gone up, the jobless rate has  gone down, and the federal budget deficit is on the decline.  Among other things, the entire American society appears to be  regaining confidence and vitality with the restoration of its  competitiveness.    The U.S. economy began picking up in the closing months of  the Bush administration. It is true, however, that the Clinton  administration's economy policy, including the enactment of a  fiscal coordination act aimed at cutting the federal budget  deficit, has consolidated the foundation for economic recovery.    The adoption of a national service system designed to  encourage young Americans to participate in society, and the  enactment of the Brady Act designed to keep guns under control  can be cited as accomplishments by the Clinton administration  that have promoted change in the United States.    After praising those accomplishments, President Clinton  focused his State of the Union Address on the present state of  American society and sought the American people's awareness and  cooperation, saying, "There are still a lot of things we have to  do."    What the President most emphatically stressed in the address  is reform of the current medical insurance system on which Mrs.  Hillary [as published] has worked. Tens of millions of  Americans do not benefit from the system, and they are said to  be unable to live free of everyday concerns. We cannot help but  be surprised at the President's forthrightness regarding the  present situation of the United States.    During the era when the U.S. economic strength was dominant  in the world and the pie shared by the American people,  including immigrants from all parts of the world, continued to  grow, the thorough individualism and self-help spirit were a  source of the vitality and diversity of the United States, an  ethnically diversified nation.    However, even the encouragement of self-help has been unable  to keep a growing number of Americans from being estranged from  society since the United States entered an era when the pie's  growth was sluggish or dropped at times. What the medical  insurance issue raises is the inconsistency of politics that has  failed to respond to changing times.    In his address, the President also stressed the need to cope  with crime and work to keep the family from collapsing. As for  measures to prevent crime, the argument for gun control has so  far been powerless against the insistence that individuals have  the right and freedom to have guns in order to protect  themselves or hunt. We hope the Clinton administration will use  the Brady Act to take effective measures to strengthen gun  control.    Whether the United States, which as sole superpower has a  great influence on the world, will succeed in domestic reform is  a question to which we cannot be apathetic. We think so because  a healthy American society will ultimately provide a basis for  America's balanced foreign policy; not because the contradiction  and evils of American society have spread to Japanese society in  the past.    The Clinton administration has often been criticized for  failing to shape a comprehensive foreign policy. In his  address, the President slightly touched on his foreign policy  but did not put forth a U.S. vision of the post-Cold War world.  We would like to see the Clinton administration present a clear  outline of its foreign policy taking into account its bitter  experiences of the past year, including the deadlocks in Somalia  and Haiti.</p>

			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Opposition to GEC bid for Ferranti Disgruntled shareholders in Ferranti International, the defence electronics group which is the subject of a token 1p-a-share rescue bid from GEC, have appealed to the group's banks to reconsider their attitude towards administration. Ferranti's board, which is backing the GEC offer, has warned that if the Pounds 11.4m bid fails to win 90 per cent support, its 15 banks, which are owed about Pounds 100m, will put the group into receivership. The shareholders' association argues that administration, or any other debt and capital restructuring, would be in the interests not only of Ferranti's 48,000 shareholders and 3,000 employees, but also in the banks' interests.</p>

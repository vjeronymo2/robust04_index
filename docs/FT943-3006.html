			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Aristide backers hide as invasion looms Almost all open supporters of Mr Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the exiled president of Haiti, have gone into hiding, fearing they will be targets of the country's military as the threat of a US-led military invasion to restore the president intensifies. The growing threat has been met with defiance by Haiti's army-backed government. Mr Emile Jonaissant, de facto president, said late on Wednesday neither his administration nor the military would give way. He accused President Bill Clinton of threatening Haiti for domestic political reasons. Mr Clinton met senior foreign policy and military advisers yesterday ahead of his televised address to the nation over the crisis, as the weight of much political comment continued to advise him not to take the fateful step of authorising US troops to move in. Officials declined comment on a New York Times report that the president might still call off a full invasion if the leaders of the military junta accepted a US offer of comfortable third-country exile and immunity from prosecution. The decision of Mr Aristide's more prominent supporters to go underground, reported yesterday by diplomats in Port-au-Prince, the capital, follows the murder of several in the past two years. It was encouraged by statements from army officers last week that 'traitorous' Haitians would 'pay' in the event of an invasion. There is also growing fear in Port-au-Prince that the military, which overthrew Mr Aristide three years ago, may turn its guns on the slums, in which he has significant popular support. Although Haiti's poorly equipped and poorly trained army of 7,000 has been expanded by a rapid recruiting programme, it is not expected to offer much resistance to an invading force three times larger. However, maverick elements in the military are considered likely to hide in the slums or countryside and begin guerrilla resistance. The invading forces may well have the support, or at least acquiescence, of many junior officers in the Haitian military who have in recent weeks been meeting representatives of foreign intelligences services, mainly from the US. They have been promised early amnesty and other unspecified 'rewards' for not resisting the invasion. The three leaders of the military - General Raoul Cedras, the commander of the armed forces, General Philippe Biamby, the chief of staff, and Colonel Michel Francois, the police chief - will be taken into custody by the invading forces, partly for their own protection, diplomats say. Mr Robert Malval, the prime minister who was appointed by Mr Aristide last year under an abortive agreement to resolve the political crisis but was sidelined by the military, will be reinstated after the invasion, and will start preparations for the president's return. The timing of Mr Aristide's return to Haiti will depend on the success of 'the efforts at pacification and the degree of political calm' in Haiti, according to the envoys. Besides an increase in the frequency of military patrols on the streets of the capital, and the use of cement-filled drums to block roads around the military headquarters, there are few signs that the military is preparing to defend the country against an invading force.</p>

			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: A pfennig for your thoughts THESE are hard times for contrarians. All the gloom in the world in the markets, yet prices keep falling. What can it be that they have failed to discount? One thing is governments. Ever since President Hoover tried to talk the US economy up during the 1929 crash, markets have taken official reassurance with a pinch of arsenic; but they still try to do it. Tokyo provided a textbook example on Friday, when a ministerial meeting designed to reassure the markets knocked more than 500 points off equities. Our own embattled Mr Norman Lamont may have done it again yesterday, with yet another stonewalling defence of the present strategy and worse, another forecast of recovery. One might have hoped that he would have learned from the sterling wobbles a week earlier, when every statement from Downing Street of unyielding commitment to the present D-Mark target for sterling drove the currency a bit lower. Especially, perhaps, the announcement that if the D-Mark did revalue, we would go up too. Like Matilda's aunt when faced with lies, the market stared and stretched its eyes. It is all meant to sound resolute, but what it actually arouses is memories stretching back, according to age, to Sir Stafford Cripps, or Mr Callaghan, or the umpteen devaluations between the first French proclamation of the franc fort and the actual achievement of a strong franc. It is interesting to contrast these humiliations with the continued willingness of Wall Street to support implausible multiples in the face of complaints from the White House about the recovery's sluggishness - though at least they do have a recovery of sorts. These reactions are in fact perfectly logical. Faced with disappointments, the markets do not like to be told that they are fussing about nothing. They prefer to learn that the authorities are disappointed too; that preserves the hope of remedial action. Defensiveness, by contrast, breeds uncertainty: is the government really bent on punitive deflation, or stupid, or hiding something? The best policy in hard times appears to be frankness; failing that, silence. Meanwhile, uncertainty is increasing from causes quite beyond government control. The confrontation with Iraq would be bad enough, without the appearance of a credible electoral challenge in the US, the disquiet on the government's back benches in London, and the grim implications for banking of any marked worsening in the worldwide recession. The bond markets might be expected to provide the good news in bad times; but they are sulking too. In nearly all the main markets they can see enough fiscal problems stretching into the far future to preserve a more or less indefinite buyers' market - a sadly familiar picture in the London gilts market until a decade or so ago. In this respect the long-term prospect is in fact much better in New York and London than in markets which are traditionally better respected. The demographic problems facing Britain and the US are a fleabite compared with those of Japan or of most continental European countries, and could be tackled with a moderate tax increase; but markets cannot be expected to adjust to such a change in their perceptions overnight. This is where authoritative government statements might be helpful rather than suggesting panic. But if the markets are, in fact, slowly awakening to the emergence of deep-seated problems of government finance, the recent movement of prices makes a lot of sense. Permanent fiscal problems suggest a very durable rise in real long-term interest rates; and that in turn explains the closing gap between bond and equity yields. In real terms it has been closed from the bond side. This has an especially strong message for London, since in most low-inflation countries the investment institutions have always preferred a far higher bond proportion in their portfolios than has been seen in London for more than 30 years. So the cult of the equity may indeed be over, failing a new burst of inflation. And on inflation, ministers are credible.</p>

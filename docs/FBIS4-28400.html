			<p>BFN     [Text] So far Haiphong City has resettled safely and  properly over 19,680 returnees including the first group of 203  returnees coming home from Japan.    In addition to expenditure extracted from local budget,  international organizations provide subsidies for 113 projects  that help 18,300 people and prepare for more returnees who will  come later. The subsidizing programs help repair houses for 117  families, create job opportunities, give occupational training,  medical services, and other facilities to help the returnees  quickly reintegrate into the community.</p>

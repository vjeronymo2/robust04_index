			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> One-Year T-Bill Rates Fall: Interest rates on 52-week Treasury bills fell at  the latest action to the lowest level since November. The Treasury Department  sold $8.5 billion of the new bills at an average discount rate of 8.18%, down  from 8.44% at the last auction May 4. The rates were the lowest since Nov. 17,  1988, when the one-year bills sold for 7.92%. The new discount rate understates  the actual return to investors -- 8.85%, with a $10,000 bill selling for  $9,172.90.  </P></p>

			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / SmithKline in Dollars 2.9bn US deal: Acquisition of Sterling Health creates world's biggest consumer drugs business SmithKline Beecham is creating the world's biggest consumer drugs business by buying Sterling Health from Eastman Kodak of the US for Dollars 2.925bn (Pounds 1.88bn). The deal, announced yesterday, brings Sterling Health's big-selling brands such as Panadol and Andrews together with SmithKline's Eno and Tums. It is the largest acquisition yet in over-the-counter (OTC) drugs and doubles London-based SmithKline's annual OTC sales to more than Dollars 2bn. SB will pay cash, funding the acquisition through bank borrowings and commercial paper. The deal is SB's second multibillion dollar acquisition since Mr Jan Leschly became chief executive in April. The following month it paid Dollars 2.3bn for Diversified Pharmaceuticals Services, a US drugs distributor. SB and Sterling Health, the OTC non-prescription business of Sterling Winthrop, have fought over markets in painkillers and gastro-intestinal remedies for many years, largely in the US, the UK and Germany where SmithKline has 70 per cent of its OTC sales. This deal gives SB a presence in more than 100 countries. 'We are going to become the major healthcare company in the world,' said Mr Leschly yesterday. The healthcare industry has witnessed a series of mergers and takeovers involving many big players such as Eli Lilly and Merck of the US and Switzerland's Roche. The industry's consolidation is a response to pressure from customers - employers who pay health insurance premiums in the US and governments elsewhere - to cut healthcare costs. Sterling Health made a profit of Dollars 162.4m on sales of Dollars 1.006bn in 1993 and had net assets of Dollars 372.1m at the end of last year. SB's accounts will include a provision of about Pounds 500m to cover the costs of restructuring and rationalising the combined businesses. Gearing, net debt as a percentage of shareholders' funds, will rise from less than 60 per cent to 300 per cent by the end of this year, but should fall by 1996 as SmithKline sells non-strategic businesses, said Mr Hugh Collum, finance director. Kodak could raise almost Dollars 4.6bn from this sale and the planned sale of Sterling Winthrop's prescription business to Sanofi for nearly Dollars 1.7bn. The company said it hoped to complete the Sanofi deal early in the third quarter of 1994, with the SB transaction being closed in the fourth. The cash will be used to reduce Kodak's Dollars 6.4bn debt. The company is also in talks about selling L&amp;F Products for an estimated Dollars 2bn. It is a do-it-yourself products company with sales last year of Dollars 1bn. Kodak also wants to sell its clinical diagnostics business  - which had 1993 sales of around Dollars 700m - for which it could expect more than Dollars 1bn. In New York, shares in SB rose Dollars  1/2 to close at Dollars 31 1/2 and Eastman Kodak gained Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 50 5/8 . SB has had intermittent discussions with Eastman Kodak over Sterling Health for about four years. But it was only in May this year that Eastman Kodak declared its intention to sell its healthcare operations. The sale to Elf Sanofi, its European partner, came the following month. Further deals are likely in the sector. Shares in Marion Merrell Dow, the drugs company which is 72 per cent owned by Dow Chemical, climbed 8.43 per cent yesterday to close at Dollars 24 1/8 on news that it had retained Lehman Brothers to advise it on a number of options, including 'potential business combinations'.

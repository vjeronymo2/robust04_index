			<p>BFN     [Text] Vladivostok, May 17 (XINHUA) -- A Chinese warship  formation arrived here this morning for a four-day call-in  visit, the first of its kind by the Navy of the People's  Liberation Army to a Russian port.    Headed by Wang Jiying, commander of the North China Sea  Fleet  of the Chinese Navy, the formation consists of a deep-sea rescue  vessel, a destroyer and an escort vessel, both equipped with  missile launchers.    The call-in visit is in return for a visit made by a Russian  naval fleet to eastern China's Qingdao last August.    The formation was honored first by a gun salute from the  Russian Navy stationed in Vladivostok, and then at a quayside  welcoming ceremony attended by commanders of Russia's Pacific  Fleet.    Wang told the press that the Armed Forces of China and  Russia  are increasing their exchange programs, and the friendly  relationship between the two navies is on the rise.    He also noted that closer ties between the two navies would  serve the interests not only of the two peoples, but also of the  peace and stability of the Asia-Pacific region and of the world  as a whole.</p>

			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Britain will speed up ratification, says Major MR JOHN MAJOR last night seized on Denmark's endorsement of Maastricht to signal that Britain would now press ahead quickly with ratification of a treaty that has threatened to split the Tory party. Amid undisguised jubilation in Whitehall, ministers said the government hoped to complete the tortuous ratification process before parliament's summer recess at the end of July. Mr Major, speaking to businessmen at the annual dinner of the Confederation of British Industry, said the government now intended to 'get on with doing business for Britain in Europe'. Emphasising that ratification was essential to ensure that Britain was not sidelined in Europe, the prime minister commented: 'The issue is British jobs, British sales, Britain's future . . . the sooner we put this debilitating business behind us, the better it will be for British business.' Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, added that the government's objective now was to 'get on with life after Maastricht'. The prime minister, who has seen his government's authority drained, said the Tory party should put behind it the 'incomprehensible and interminable' wrangling over Maastricht. Conservative Euro-sceptics acknowledged that the Danish result had severely dented their hopes of wrecking the agreement. But they vowed to continue to fight British ratification in the House of Lords and in the courts. Lady Thatcher and Lord Tebbit will lead another rebellion against the bill in the Lords but Mr Major is confident they will fail. Lord Tebbit, who intends to table amendments to the legislation calling for a British referendum, vowed last night that the 'fight' would go on. The prime minister expects to defeat a separate legal challenge from the Tory Euro-sceptics over the status of Britain's opt-out from the Treaty social chapter. The only remaining option for the sceptics would then be to join with the Labour party and vote for the scrapping of the social chapter opt-out. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, said the opposition would continue its campaign for the opt-out to be removed. He said: 'Unlike Britain, the people of Denmark were fortunate enough to be presented with a version of the Maastricht Treaty which contained the Social Chapter.' The Maastricht bill will complete its passage through the House of Commons tomorrow. In spite of the threat of a rebellion by 40 or more Conservative Euro-sceptics, the bill's move to the House of Lords is guaranteed because of Labour's decision to abstain on the crucial third reading vote. Senior ministers acknowledged that wounds in the Tory party from the bitter struggle over the treaty will take years to heal. The government has already been warned by its supporters that any move to take sterling back into the European exchange rate mechanism - as required under the treaty - would provoke an even bigger revolt.

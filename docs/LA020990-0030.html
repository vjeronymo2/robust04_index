			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY BEGS OFF, BUT PROSECUTES MOM;  </P> <P> FETUSES: RETREATING FROM COMMUNAL RESPONSIBILITY, WE TRY TO COMPEL INDIVIDUAL  RESPONSIBILITY BY MAKING CRIMINALS OF SOME TRAGIC CASES.  </P> <P> The Wyoming woman must have hit bottom -- or some narrow ledge over that abyss  -- when she walked out of her home on Jan. 2 and checked into a motel in  Laramie. Just last fall, 29-year-old Diane Pfannenstiel had lost custody of her  two children, one 4 years old, the other 6 months old. Her family was what the  social workers genteelly call "dysfunctional."  </P> <P> She was pregnant again. Four days earlier, she had returned from an  alcohol-rehabilitation program. Now she had left home with little more than the  bruises on her back, her neck, her arms -- the ones that came, she says, from  her husband when he choked and beat her.  </P> <P> Somehow, this woman had enough of a survival instinct left to call SAFE, a  project for battered women. The people there brought her to the police station  to have her bruises photographed, to have her husband charged with abuse, and  then brought her to the hospital to be treated.  </P> <P> In the normal course of such sad and seamy stories, this might have been the  turning point of one woman's long, slow, uncertain climb up from the ledge. But  something happened to Pfannenstiel at the hospital. She was arrested.  </P> <P> In police custody, Diane Pfannenstiel was tested for alcohol, jailed and then  charged with the crime of drinking while pregnant. She was prosecuted for  felony child abuse.  </P> <P> So her name is added to the roll call -- not a very distinguished list but a  growing one -- of some three dozen pregnant women who have become the targets  of the latest fad of copycat criminal prosecutions. It has become trendy to  arrest pregnant women for endangering their fetuses.  </P> <P> In Florida, Jennifer Johnson was convicted of delivering a controlled substance  to a minor, her fetus. In Illinois, Melanie Green was charged with manslaughter  for the death of a baby connected to her alleged cocaine use. And in South  Carolina, perhaps a dozen women have been arrested after the hospitals they  went to for maternity care tested them for cocaine and turned them in to the  police.  </P> <P> Behind most of these cases are prosecutors who assume the mantle of protector  of the fetus, who try to separate the "innocent" unborn from its "guilty"  bearer. Indeed this mantle has become a popular costume in an era when we know  and worry more about life in the womb and how it can be damaged.  </P> <P> Cocaine babies, fetal alcohol syndrome, smoking and sudden infant death  syndrome -- all these have entered the daily journalism of pregnancy dangers.  The knowledge of tragic and permanent damage before birth has infected most  pregnant women with trimesters full of fantasies. Today, it isn't just  prosecutors who look accusingly, judgmentally at a pregnant woman strung out,  or one with a drink or a cigarette in her hand.  </P> <P> But this lineup of pregnant women, this police action, threatens to turn  pregnancy back into a special class again. This time a special class of  criminals.  </P> <P> A 29-year-old woman is not barred from drinking in Wyoming. Diane Pfannenstiel  was prosecuted solely because she was pregnant. It isn't an idle ride on the  slippery slope to ask whether women might also be arrested for disobeying other  health commandments. As her lawyer, Mary Elizabeth Galvan, asked: "If I am  pregnant, can the state regulate my life? What if I am smoking? What if I am  living with a man who smokes?"  </P> <P> There is something even more pernicious behind this wave of arrests: a  not-so-subtle shift of focus. Americans no longer feel as confident in our  collective ability or willingness to help others. We hear little lately about  the state's obligation to provide care; little about the pregnant women who  can't afford proper care.  </P> <P> Communities that are slow and stingy with support may be quick to prosecute. In  South Carolina, one of the very hospitals testing and turning in pregnant  cocaine addicts has no facilities for treating them. In retreat from principles  of communal responsibility, we are trying to force individual responsibility.  </P> <P> The case against Diane Pfannenstiel was dismissed last week -- but only because  the prosecutor failed to prove she'd hurt the fetus. If it's born damaged, she  could still be liable. And if she is convicted of this felony charge, would the  newborn end up in foster care? What would happen next? Where is the quick fix  for mother or child?  </P> <P> Underlying the urge to prosecute there is a belief that the addicted woman is  failing willfully, selfishly, to take care of her fetus. The sadder reality is  that an addicted woman has failed to take care of herself as well as her womb.  That is a lesson she won't learn in jail.  </P></p>

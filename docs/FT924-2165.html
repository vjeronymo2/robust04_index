			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Fuel price rises may be used to reduce emissions HIGHER fuel prices may be needed if the UK is to meet international targets for reducing carbon dioxide emissions, a government discussion paper said yesterday. According to Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, some of the measures the UK will have to take to meet international commitments 'will not be easy'. He denied that the debate about the future of coal could jeopardise the UK's ability to meet international targets, even though the use of coal in power stations to generate electricity emits twice as much carbon dioxide as the use of gas. 'If the review decides that more energy is to be produced by coal, more savings will have to be found elsewhere,' he said. One of the main targets of the paper is transport, the sector where emissions are growing fastest. A 10 per cent rise in fuel prices above the rate of inflation could prevent emission of one million tonnes of carbon a year (MtC), or about 0.6 per cent of the UK's total emissions, the paper says. Equipping new cars with speed limiters and reflecting fuel efficiency in the price of new cars could save another 2 per cent. On government projections, UK emissions in the year 2000 are likely to be at least 6 per cent, or about 10 MtC, above target levels. However, car sales tax was abolished in the Autumn Statement, a measure to help stimulate the depressed car market. Mr Chris Smith, Labour's environment spokesman, said: 'The Autumn Statement was all about building roads and not about investing in public transport.' More than 150 countries have signed the United Nations framework convention on climate change, agreed at the Rio Earth Summit in June. Under the convention they must make plans to stabilise emissions of carbon dioxide at 1990 levels by the year 2000. Mr Howard said that the UK intended to ratify the convention by the end of 1993, obliging it to bring emissions back to 160 MtC. According to a report last month by the Department of Trade and Industry, the UK's carbon dioxide emissions in the year 2000 could be between 157 MtC and 179MtC. Yesterday's paper uses the middle case of 170MtC. The DTI projections were based on an assumption that the proportion of electricity generated by coal would fall sharply during the 1990s from 68 per cent to 47 per cent, while gas generation of electricity would rise from zero to about 22 per cent. A carbon or energy tax is among the options in the paper. It also lists measures to encourage energy efficiency by businesses and households. Mr Andrew Warren, director of the Association for the Conservation of Energy, warned: 'We are running hard to stand still - investment by industry, commerce and households in energy saving measures is down by 28 per cent in the past two years.'

			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Norweb rises to Pounds 157m but shares fall 17p NORWEB, the Manchester-based electricity company, yesterday cut electricity prices by 1.6 per cent from July 1 as it announced a 14 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 157.1m for the year to March 31. A final dividend of 14.1p makes a 20p total, a rise of 13 per cent. The total is covered 3.2 times by earnings of 64.6p. The improvement came in spite of a 0.4 per cent decline in the number of electricity units distributed, with the industrial sector 2.7 per cent down. However, operating profit was up 7.4 per cent at Pounds 138.7m. That was helped by improved efficiency in the regulated businesses with staff numbers reduced by a further 197 staff, leaving 5,176. The supply business made operating profits of Pounds 13.5m, compared with Pounds 11.9m. The improvement was helped by the addition of 96 custom-ers in the over one megawatt market, taking the total to 363. Mr Ken Harvey, chairman, said the company had already signed deals with customers who use above 100kW for the period after next April when the market for medium sized users is opened up to competition. COMMENT Norweb fared worse than most of its competitors yesterday with its shares falling 17p to 480p. It was not helped by Mr Harvey's comments on the dividend race and retailing profits falling to Pounds 6m (Pounds 6.7m). Norweb is heavily involved in retailing, a sector in which the industry has failed to distinguish itself. Its refusal to rule out a bid for the Clydesdale chain in Scotland may worry the market even though Norweb appears better at selling electrical goods than other recs. Overall, there is little to quarrel about in the management's strategy. Mr Harvey has been one of the toughest negotiators with the government over coal and nuclear contracts and the distribution business fundamentals are strong. The shares, trading yesterday at a prospective yield of 5.8 per cent assuming dividends this year of 22.5p, should recover yesterday's losses fairly quickly.</p>

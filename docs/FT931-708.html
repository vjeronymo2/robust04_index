			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Arts: Stravinsky and Janacek - Concert Stravinsky's Symphony of Psalms and Janacek's Glagolitic Mass compare and contrast wonderfully in a choral programme. It is not just the juxtaposition of a great composer with a lesser light, nor the devout expression of faith of a gnostic against the instinctive humanism of a confirmed atheist. These two pieces written just four years apart (the Janacek first in 1926) provide vertiginous differences of approach - the symphony's chaste discipline, the Glagolitic's freely associating explosions of emotion - it is often hard to believe they are such close contemporaries. On Saturday the latest instalment of 'Towards the Millennium' brought the two works to the Festival Hall with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra and its Chorus, conducted by Simon Rattle. Both were intense, vivid performances - representing the very best of Rattle one is tempted to say - with the Chorus, singing the mass from memory, wonderfully prepared and ready to respond crisply to every nuance. If anything it was the Stravinsky that emerged the more freshly minted; Rattle sifted and graded the textures of the first movement with pinpoint accuracy, untangled the fugal knots of the second, and gave an Apollonian elegance to the repetitions of the third. The exuberance of the Janacek was captured in a very different way, with saturated orchestral splendour - bold, abrasive brass, high tensile strings, explosive organ solos from Thomas Trotter - and a willingness to play for high expressive stakes. Moments of over-exuberance sometimes threatened to overwhelm the soloists, but Faye Robinson's soprano, a-quiver with fervour, and John Mitchinson's stentorian tenor usually survived, while the textures generally gave the mezzo (Ameral Gunson) and bass (Stephen Richardson) an easier ride. The orchestra had begun with Schoenberg's Variations for Orchestra Op. 31. Rattle steered a lucid course through its structural intricacies, making perfect, elegant sense of the variations themselves and bringing a real sense of mounting drama to the finale, as one development section collapses in on the next. Every particle of the instrumental playing was alive, sharp etched; it was just the gripping prelude, though, to an evening that was outstanding in every respect. Royal Festival Hall; final London concerts tomorrow and Thursday</p>

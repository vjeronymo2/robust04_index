			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Renata Wrobel: "Public Opinion Research Institute </F> for RZECZPOSPOLITA; The Left Goes Up, Peasants Go Down"]    [Text] The most surprising result of the latest opinion  poll on Sejm election preferences is the low position of the  Polish Peasant Party [PSL], which received merely 12 percent of  the "votes." This is half as much as the score of the  Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] (a considerable improvement of  its position in comparison with April), and only a little higher  than the result of the Freedom Union [UW]. The rating of the  latter is much lower than might be expected if we simply added  former supporters of the Democratic Union [UD] to the supporters  of the Liberal-Democratic Congress [KLD]. The center right is  hardly making up for the losses that it incurred in last year's  elections. The poll was carried out at the request of  RZECZPOSPOLITA by the Public Opinion Research Institute [PBS] in  Sopot in mid-May.  <H5>  Disillusioned Peasants </H5>   After gaining favorable (24-25 percent) ratings at the end  of  last year, the support for SLD has been at the level of 20  percent since January; in May, however, it "went up" quite  noticeably. The increase in the electoral popularity of the  left coincided with a decrease in the number of supporters of  the other government coalition member -- PSL. The decrease in  its popularity had been continuing for several months then;  however, since January it has plummeted by as many as 5  percentage points.    The opinion has become quite popular that PSL is in a  luxurious situation in comparison with other Polish political  parties, because it has an exceptionally stable and faithful  electorate, which consists first of all of peasants and  inhabitants of rural areas. As this opinion poll suggests,  however, this may turn out to be only an illusion. The  disillusionment of the peasants toward PSL is quite clear; the  popularity of PSL in this group is obviously decreasing.    Figures speak for themselves. As recently as December and  January, 59 percent of peasants would have voted for PSL; in  March -- 52 percent; in April -- 46 percent; and in May -- only  38 percent. Every fifth peasant would now prefer to back SLD,  every eighth -- Polish Peasant Party--Peasant Accord [PSL--PL].  Among the persons who supported PSL in the September elections,  nearly 60 percent of the respondents would make the same  decision today; however, almost one in five would now back SLD.  PSL also ceased to be the most popular party among the  inhabitants of rural areas: it can count on the support of 21  percent of the representatives of this group, whereas SLD can  count on 24 percent.    In the electoral "local" polls, the rating of PSL is still  quite good. This may mean that many voters separate the party's  policy on the state level from the moves made by popular local  activists.  <H5>  Two Plus Two Does Not Necessarily Make Four </H5>   Those who thought that the merger of UD and KLD would  immediately ensure the new party at least a 20-percent support,  as it was suggested by the last ratings of UD and KLD, can speak  about disappointment. The result achieved by UW is much poorer.  Some voters most certainly did not accept the merger; others  are waiting for programmatic and tactical corrections; still  others are simply not very familiar with the name. For the time  being the hopes of the leaders of the new party are not coming  true: The leaders are hoping that their party will attract  persons from outside UD and KLD, even though it must be admitted  that the number of former voters of the Non-Party Bloc in  Support of Reforms [BBWR] who now declare support for UW has  slightly increased.    In accordance with earlier guesses, the UW is a  particularly popular party among the youngest respondents,  well-educated persons, persons with good incomes, persons in  high posts, school and university students, as well as  inhabitants of big towns and cities. Most of the September  supporters of UD (63 percent) and KLD (67 percent) are ready to  vote for the new party. An interesting thing is that persons  working "on their own" do not really burn to support UW, which  is contrary to the image built up by the KLD circles. They more  readily declare support for the Labor Union [UP] or SLD, and  equally readily for BBWR and the Confederation for an  Independent Poland [KPN] (private entrepreneurs are a group  characterized by probably the most diversified party  preferences).  <H5>  Dissatisfied Head for SLD </H5>   Talking about electorates. It is worth noticing a certain  process that can be observed among the voters of SLD. The  grouping is losing supporters with higher education (at the end  of last year it would have received the support of 35 percent of  the representatives of this group; now -- only 24 percent) and  persons in high posts (34 percent and 20 percent respectively).  The party is becoming increasingly popular among voters with  elementary education, manual workers, especially unskilled  workers, persons with the lowest incomes, as well as senior  citizens and disability pensioners -- that is, part of the  classical "dissatisfied electorate."  <H5>  The Center of the Table More Stable </H5>   The popularity fluctuations are far smaller outside the  first  three positions. For the last several months UP has regularly  achieved the level of 8 to 10 percent of the "votes"; BBWR and  KPN -- from 4 to 5 percent each; and the Union for Real Politics  is slowly joining this group. The exception is "Solidarity"  ["S"] the rating of which noticeably increased in May.  Incidentally, its rating has improved four times since the  period immediately following the parliamentary elections. Only  the next poll will show whether this increase, probably caused  by the latest "offensive" of the union, will be lasting. "S" is  now particularly attractive for voters with vocational  education, with an income ranging between one million and one  and a half million zlotys a month per capita, and for unskilled  workers.    The greatest losers in the September elections -- the  parties  of the center right -- are regaining their influence rather  slowly. The five groupings that were taken into account in our  poll (the Center Accord, Christian-National Union -- ZChN, PL,  UPR, and Movement for the Republic) jointly receive 14 percent  of the "votes," whereas right after the elections, in November  last year, the result was 12 percent. However, the relation  between such simple addition and the actual influence of a party  that is formed as a result of a possible merger is shown by the  example of UW.    Materials used in the report include opinion polls conducted  every month by PBS for RZECZPOSPOLITA; the last one was carried  out on 14 and 15 May (a 1,010-person representative sample of  adult inhabitants of the country).  <H5>  [Box, p 2] </H5> <H5>  Electoral Preferences, March-May 1994 </H5>   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |(in percent)                                                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |SLD                      |March                    |20                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |April                    |21                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |May                      |26                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |UW                       |March                    |21[.sup]1[/]           |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |April                    |21[.sup]1[/]           |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |May                      |15                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |PSL                      |March                    |18                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |April                    |17                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |May                      |12                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |UP                       |March                    |10                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |April                    |8                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |May                      |9                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Independent Self-Governi-|March                    |6                        |  |ngTrade Union "S"        |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |April                    |5                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |May                      |8                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |BBWR                     |March                    |5                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |April                    |5                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |May                      |5                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |ZChN                     |March                    |4                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |April                    |4                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |May                      |5                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |KPN                      |March                    |4                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |April                    |4                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |May                      |5                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |[.sup]1[/]The sum of the rating of UD and KLD.                             |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

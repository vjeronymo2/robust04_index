			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Japanese defend chip agreement against attacks A SENIOR Japanese trade official yesterday condemned suggestions by US semiconductor companies that a bilateral agreement on foreign access to Japan's chip market is close to collapse. Mr Noboru Hatakeyama, vice-minister of international trade and industry, said the comments by members of the US Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) were 'unhelpful' and did not reflect the chip pact's 'spirit of co-operation'. 'Japanese companies are trying hard to fulfil their obligations. US companies also have obligations,' Mr Hatakeyama said. He was referring to the ongoing argument between the two industries over whether US producers are trying hard enough to penetrate the Japanese market. Mr Hatakeyama said the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) would be holding a regular meeting with Japanese chip consumers, beginning soon, and would urge them to increase their purchases of foreign products. Miti insists that a target of a 20 per cent foreign share by the end of this year is just a target, and that it is too early to tell if the five-year chip pact, concluded last June, is a failure. The foreign share stands at around 14 per cent, compared with 13 per cent at the end of 1990, and 8.6 per cent in 1986 - when the first five-year pact was completed. Ministry officials are angered at the interpretation by the US industry of the 20 per cent share as a specific promise. They point to the wording of the bilateral agreement, which states that the 20 per cent is recognised by Japan as a US industry expectation, but is 'neither a guarantee, a ceiling, nor a floor on the foreign market share'. The US semiconductor industry has raised the prospect of sanctions against Japanese products, if market access fails to improve. Miti believes that the US industry, which sent a delegation to Washington this week, will be unable to convince the US government to impose sanctions.</p>

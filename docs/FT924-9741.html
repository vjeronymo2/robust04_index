			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Senior Tories join property bill revolt TORY backbenchers strongly attacked the government in the Commons last night for failing to ensure adequate compensation for leasehold property owners who may be forced to sell their freeholds to tenants. Mr Jerry Wiggin, MP for Weston-super-Mare and a former junior defence minister joined with Labour MPs in voting against the Housing and Urban Development Bill. It was given a second reading by a government majority of 68 (327-259). Earlier, Mr Michael Jopling, chief whip in the first Thatcher administration and a former minister of agriculture, protested that many Tory backbenchers were 'astonished that this government, of all governments, should be seeking to force people to sell their property'. Mr David Hunt, Welsh secretary, who wound up the debate, held out little hope of significant changes being made to the bill. The likelihood of sustained attempts by Tory backbenchers to secure more generous treatment for freehold owners during the bill's committee stage was acknowledged by Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary. Mr Jopling, MP for Westmoreland and Lonsdale, dismissed as 'nothing of the sort' government claims that the freehold of such properties would be acquired by leaseholders at a fair market price. He told Mr Howard that the bill gave 'great offence to very many of us'. Mr Wiggin complained that the bill would provide substantial benefit to leaseholders at the expense of freeholders. He said a more appropriate title for the move would be the 'Building Societies (Robin Hood) Bill'. Mr Howard insisted that the fair compensation provisions in the bill did not warrant such criticism. Refusing to accept Mr Jopling's 'strictures', he said it was impossible to reform property law without affecting existing interests. Mr Howard told critics of the bill: 'What is important is that interests which are so affected should be the subject of proper compensation. I contend that the bill provides for compensation.' He said up to 750,000 tenants of leasehold flats and houses would have the opportunity to buy their freeholds. Mr Jack Straw, Labour's shadow environment secretary, condemned the government for not including a single line in the bill for building a single home at a time when there were record homeless people. Mr Straw said inclusion in the bill of a 'rent to mortgages' scheme when thousands of owner-occupiers were having their properties repossessed underscored the government's failure to address the real needs of the nation. Mr Michael Alison, Conservative MP for Selby and parliamentary spokesman for the Church Commissioners, warned that the bill would effectively drive them and other similar charities out of their traditional housing role in residential property investment and management.</p>

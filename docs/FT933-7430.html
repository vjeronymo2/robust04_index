			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / UK Company News: BSM hopes to raise up to Pounds 50m in flotation to help fund expansion BSM GROUP, owner of the British School of Motoring, one of the largest franchisers in the UK, is aiming to raise between Pounds 40m and Pounds 50m when it is floated on the London Stock Exchange in mid-October. Announcing the long expected flotation yesterday, Mr Paul Massey, chief executive, said the money would be used to repay about Pounds 30m of debt from the management buy-out of the company in 1990. It is on high fixed interest rates so a lower interest bill post-flotation and the new money raised will help fund the group's expansion. BSM reported an operating profit of Pounds 4.1m on turnover of Pounds 21m last year. For the six months to July 2 this year operating profit was Pounds 2.2m on turnover of Pounds 11.8m. It is the largest driving school in the UK, and the only one with a national presence. It operates through 134 branches spread between Aberdeen and Plymouth and has 2,000 self-employed instructors. Founded in 1910 by an Edwardian motoring enthusiast, the company was acquired in 1973 by Sir Anthony Jacobs, a businessman with wide interests. He was hoping to retain it but decided to sell when he retired and his son wanted to pursue other interests. The Pounds 40m management buy-out, which topped offers from car makers and leasing companies anxious to secure a captive market, was led by Morgan Grenfell Development Capital Partners. At the time of the flotation Morgan Grenfell will own 70 per cent, the Jacobs family 20 per cent and the balance of 10 per cent is held by management. Both Mr Massey and Mr Richard Glover, managing director of the company, said yesterday that they would not be selling any of their shares. They own 30 per cent and 20 per cent respectively of the 21-strong management group's stake. Morgan Grenfell is sponsoring the flotation and James Capel are brokers.</p>

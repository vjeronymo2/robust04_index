			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / International Bonds: Flood of issuers tap demand for longer-dated maturities THE INTERNATIONAL bond market was flooded with new issues yesterday as borrowers took advantage of investor demand for longer-dated maturities to raise cheaper, long-term financing. The French franc sector, where 10-year yields are now below Germany's, caught investors' attention as two public-sector borrowers made a rare appearance. 'The French yield is attractive for borrowers and the currency side is quieter,' said one syndicate manager. RATP, the Paris public transport system, made its debut in the Euromarket, raising FFr2.5bn through an offering of 10-year Eurobonds priced to yield 18 basis points above the 6 3/4 per cent French government bond due 2003. The pricing was seen to be fair for a triple A-rated borrower. Region d'Ile de France, the French regional authority, offered a wider yield spread of 22 basis points on its seven-year offering which raised FFr600m. Although the borrower also has a triple-A rating, the extra yield was designed to make up for the likely lack of liquidity in the bonds. Most of the proceeds from both issues were swapped into floating-rate francs. Yesterday's activity in the French franc sector raised hopes that more borrowers would tap the sector. An official at J. P. Morgan said that good progress had been made on the planned French franc global bond for Credit Local. The issue, scheduled for October, is expected to have a 10-year maturity and raise up to FFr8bn. In the D-Mark sector, Depfa, Germany's largest mortgage bank, was able to increase its 10-year offering by DM500m to DM1.5bn due to strong investor demand. The pricing of the bonds, to yield 24 basis points over the 6 1/2 per cent bund due 2003, was regarded as decent value for a borrower which is popular with domestic investors. The aim of the deal was to raise Depfa's profile with international investors. Meanwhile, Belgium is close to launching its well-flagged D-mark Eurobond issue totalling DM600m to DM1bn. Banks have been bidding for the mandate to arrange the deal, with a proposed pricing of 15 to 22 basis points over Bunds for a maturity of more than five years. A spokesman for the borrower said the issue was likely to be launched next week. Yesterday, the World Bank awarded the mandate for its dollar global bond offering to Lehman Brothers and Nomura Securities. The offering, likely to raise Dollars 1.25bn and have a maturity of 10 years, is expected to be launched next week. Nomura is also preparing a Y30bn five-year Eurobond issue for China, its first international offering since 1987, when it raised DM300m through an issue with the same maturity. China has an indicated investment grade rating of BBB by Standard &amp; Poor's and Baa1 by Moody's. Elsewhere, British Colombia launched the first issue with a 12-year maturity in the Canadian dollar sector since 1989. It offers investors a yield pick-up of eight basis points over the borrower's 10-year global bond launched in June.</p>

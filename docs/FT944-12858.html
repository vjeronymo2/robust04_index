			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Hopes rise for Burma dialogue: New meeting with democracy campaigner A second meeting between Burma's military rulers and Ms Aung San Suu Kyi, the detained pro-democracy campaigner, sharply raised hopes at the weekend that the junta and its opponents would soon start negotiating a political settlement after years of violence and human rights abuses. Details of the meeting are scarce. Lt-Gen Khin Nyunt, the powerful head of military intelligence and 'Secretary One' of the State Law and Order Restoration Council (Slorc) - as the junta calls itself - met Ms Suu Kyi in the company of two other generals for three hours on Friday morning. Unlike the first such meeting on September 20, news of the latest encounter at an army guest house in Rangoon was given pride of place in the official media. Ms Suu Kyi, who has been under house arrest at her Rangoon home for more than five years, was shown smiling and chatting with the generals in the lead item on the television news, and three photographs appeared on the front page of the New Light of Myanmar (Burma) newspaper. Burmese citizens, who voted overwhelmingly for Ms Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy in a 1990 election whose results were ignored by the armed forces, were delighted but baffled. An official statement said merely that the discussions were 'frank and cordial', that they covered Burma's political and economic situation, including reforms being implemented by the Slorc, and examined 'steps that should be taken with a view to the long-term welfare of the nation'. No-one expects the talks to be easy. Indeed some Burmese, including government officials, dismiss the discussions as a ploy by the armed forces to improve their international image and head off a resolution in the UN general assembly condemning Burmese human rights abuses. Such suspicions are reinforced by events which attract less publicity than the meetings with Ms Suu Kyi. Earlier this month, for example, five of her fellow-dissidents were quietly sentenced to between seven and 15 years in jail on a variety of charges including spreading information 'damaging to the state'. 'The Slorc is just using the meetings to get a breathing space in the international community,' said one Burmese businessman. 'They don't want to share power or give any role to Aung San Suu Kyi in creating our country's future.' Others believe the meetings represent a genuine desire to negotiate on the part of the junta - Ms Suu Kyi herself has always said she is willing to talk - although they accept that the two sides remain far apart. 'The only common ground, perhaps, is a desire for reconciliation,' said one Rangoon-based diplomat. Ms Suu Kyi is aware of the sensitivities of the army and has gone out of her way to say she is not anti-military; her father Aung San was the Japanese-trained general who led Burma to the brink of independence from Britain in the 1940s. But she insists on the need for democracy and has called the National Convention - a Slorc-dominated conference that is drawing up a new constitution designed to ensure military control of future governments - 'a farce'. Slorc members, on the other hand, demand continued military influence in politics. Some hardliners, such as Gen Tun Kyi, the trade minister and former Mandalay commander who once called Ms Suu Kyi 'an ant to be swept off the road', are said to oppose the whole idea of negotiations. But the Slorc needs to be seen to be negotiating in good faith while it seeks the help of foreign investors and donors. An economic recovery in the last couple of years has begun to repair the damage caused by the army's 'Burmese Way to Socialism' after it took power in 1962. Even Singaporean and Thai investors sympathetic to the junta say they would like to see Ms Suu Kyi released, while the western nations and Japan want to profit from the economic growth in this country of 43m people at the same time as upholding their human rights principles; Mr Thomas Hubbard, US deputy assistant secretary of state for east Asia, is to visit Burma this week after a long period of frosty relations between the two countries. As one Burmese dissident noted last week, the increasingly confident junta is having some success in changing the international agenda. Foreign governments used to demand the instant release of Ms Suu Kyi and the immediate transfer of power to the democratically-elected government; now they want a 'meaningful dialogue' and moves towards democracy. The hard task facing the Slorc and Ms Suu Kyi is to agree on a definition of democracy. Brig-Gen Kyaw Ba, a member of the 21-man Slorc, commenting on the Suu Kyi-Slorc talks in an interview on Friday, declared that Burma already enjoyed freedom. 'We have a democracy according to the Myanmar way,' he said. 'Democracy must be a disciplined democracy. It must not be a rowdy one.' Ms Suu Kyi would have sighed at these words. At a meeting with a US congressman in February, she said: 'Having imposed the Burmese Way to Socialism on us for so many years, I now dread the Slorc wanting to impose its idea of a Burmese Way to Democracy.'</p>

			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / US healthcare 'coalition' underscores rift A group of centrist Republican and Democratic senators met yesterday morning to try to hammer out a bundle of amendments to the US healthcare reform bill proposed by the Democratic leadership in Congress and backed by President Bill Clinton. The senators, who like to call themselves the 'mainstream coalition', have presented their work as the last serious chance to get a sensible, bipartisan healthcare reform bill this year. But their deliberations have merely underlined the deep divisions over the health issue, and highlighted the possibility that apparently modest, incremental reforms may end up costing more than the more thorough reorganisation backed by Mr Clinton. Senator John Breaux, a right-wing Democrat from Louisiana who is one of the group's leaders, acknowledged he and his colleagues had been unable to agree on a 'full-fledged health reform bill', and had had to limit themselves to a bundle of amendments to the bill proposed by Senate majority leader George Mitchell. But even that scaled-down effort had to be revised drastically at the last minute when the Congressional Budget Office, the independent agency that has the task of analysing the costs and effects of the various competing healthcare reform plans, warned that their cost estimates were as much as Dollars 300bn (Pounds 193.5bn) off the mark. The 'mainstream coalition' plan takes as its starting point a proposal agreed by the Senate finance committee, which also served as the basis of Senator Mitchell's bill. That is the aim of achieving health insurance for 95 per cent of the US population by the year 2001. But where the Mitchell plan includes a fallback mechanism, in case that goal is not met, under which employers would be compelled to pay half of the cost of their workers' insurance, the 'mainstream coalition' proposes a softer fallback: a commission that would suggest improvements if the plan fell short of 95 per cent coverage. The group, whose membership has fluctuated between seven and 15 senators, was due to discuss its amendments yesterday morning with Senator Mitchell and then with Senator Robert Dole, the Republican leader, before making the plan public. But the frustrations that the senators have experienced in finding common ground may strengthen the hand of the right-wing Republicans who are fighting against any healthcare reform. Some centrist Democrats have concluded that the exercise is so bogged down that there is now no realistic chance of achieving responsible reform this year.</p>

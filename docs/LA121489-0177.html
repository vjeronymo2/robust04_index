			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: BASEBALL RELEASES FEMALE UMPIRE POSTEMA  </P> <P> After 13 years of toiling in the minor leagues in an effort to become the first  female umpire in the majors, Pam Postema was released by baseball officials,  she said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Postema, 35, the third female umpire in professional baseball, became the first  to be promoted to triple A, where she remained for eight seasons.  </P> <P> "I liked the game, I liked umpiring and I really thought it should be my life  -- that's why I stuck it out," Postema told the Associated Press in a telephone  interview from Phoenix, where she works as a driver for United Parcel Service.  "And I still think I can do the job as good as anybody.  </P> <P> "I'm bitter right now and I don't want to brag, but if I couldn't make it, I  don't see how any woman can."  </P> <P> Her departure leaves Theresa Cox, who made her debut last year in the Arizona  Rookie League, as the game's only female umpire.  </P></p>

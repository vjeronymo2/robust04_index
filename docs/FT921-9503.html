			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Trade and the Environment: Incentives needed for clean growth THE Gatt report argues that in general positive incentives to comply with international environmental agreements will be more effective than trade sanctions. Such incentives are a key feature of proposals to introduce a system of tradeable pollution permits to combat global warming, now being studied by the Geneva-based United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad). This system, proponents claim, could control global emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, while allowing developing countries to continue industrialisation - a process that involves more use of fossil fuels and so CO emissions. At the same time, Third World nations would have an incentive to grow more 'cleanly'. Under the plan, outlined in a report to be published by Unctad this spring, each country would be allocated a quota of tradeable carbon emission entitlements (TCEEs). Worldwide, these would add to whatever CO emission targets were set by international agreement, for instance, in any protocol to the framework convention on climate change due for signing at the UN earth summit next June. However, developing countries would be allocated more permits than they needed, while industrialised countries would get fewer. Surplus permits would be tradeable on an international exchange, so providing poor nations with finance to speed development. It would nevertheless pay developing countries to invest the money in clean technologies, so as to minimise the number of permits needed to 'cover' CO emissions. Rich countries would also benefit from the scheme by comparison with alternatives, Unctad argues. It would bring on board an international agreement big potential polluters like China and India, with huge fossil fuel reserves. Both have said they cannot accept constraints on growth imposed by a global warming accord without massive transfers of aid and technology. The scheme would also minimise the economic costs of limiting carbon dioxide emissions in the industrialised world, by ensuring that reductions are made first where the cost of doing so is least. This is because countries have an incentive to cut CO emissions wherever it costs less to do so than buying a permit in the market. The report adds that an international system of trade-able permits is compatible with any domestic mechanism for tackling carbon dioxide emissions. In addition to the conventional regulatory approach, the United States is experimenting with pollution permits under the 1990 Clean Air Act, while the European Community has plans for a carbon tax.</p>

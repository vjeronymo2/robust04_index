			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / The Gooda Walker Judgment: Spiral that got out of control finally unwound The end of one of the most spectacular boom and bust episodes seen at the Lloyd's insurance market is in sight following yesterday's court victory by Gooda Walker Names. The Names were among about 4,000 whose assets supported syndicates managed by the Gooda Walker agency between 1987 and 1990. Many were among the least wealthy ever sucked into Lloyd's. Yet their overall losses amount to more than Pounds 1bn, more than 13 per cent of the losses suffered by Lloyd's since 1988. Gooda Walker's managing agency administered a range of syndicates, which originally specialised in aviation and marine business. During the 1980s they expanded into a specialist area of reinsurance - the 'spiral'. Its underwriters covered high-level risks underwritten by other syndicates and companies. Its members' agency earned fees by placing Names on Gooda's own and other syndicates. Gooda's syndicates earned respectable profits during the mid-1980s when there were relatively few catastrophe losses. In 1986 one of its biggest syndicates ranked seventh out of 102 non-marine syndicates. While syndicates in other sectors of the market grew relatively slowly in an increasingly competitive international marketplace Gooda expanded its reinsurance activities. Names, many new to Lloyd's, flooded onto the syndicates and Gooda's capacity - its ability to accept premiums - increased sharply, from Pounds 47.9m in 1983 to Pounds 270.4m in 1988. Names on syndicate 290 jumped from 713 in 1983 to 3,163 in 1989. Many newcomers came directly from Gooda's own members' agency. As other syndicates and companies were attracted to booming 'spiral' business, rates charged by underwriters fell. With premium income inadequate, the syndicates were vulnerable to a string of large catastrophe losses, triggered by 1987's storms. Gooda's syndicates were overwhelmed by losses from the Piper Alpha explosion in July 1988, Hurricane Hugo in September 1989 and the European storms of January 1990. The businesses limped on through 1990 and part of 1991 but were eventually forced into liquidation. All its syndicates ceased to trade and the affairs of its Names were transferred to other agencies. In June 1992 it emerged that Mr Tony Gooda, formerly chairman of the members' agency, and himself a Name, had applied to the Lloyd's hardship committee for help to meet his losses. In late 1992 a Lloyd's internal review found that management deficiencies and poor underwriting were at the heart of the syndicates' difficulties.</p>

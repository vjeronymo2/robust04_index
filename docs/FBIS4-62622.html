			<p>BFN     [Text] At the Russian-Ukrainian talks held in the Russian  Ministry for Cooperation with the CIS countries  (Minsotrudnichestvo) on Tuesday, the Ukrainian side "pledged to  take measures for repayment of part of its debt to Russia for  fuel supplies." The Agency of Oil Information learned this from  well-informed sources in Minsotrudnichestvo. According to them,  the debt as of May 1 is more than 1,485 trillion rubles,  including for gas -- 1.22 trillion rubles, for oil -- 200.6  billion rubles, electricity -- 29 billion rubles, coal -- 21.8  billion rubles, oil products -- 6.5 billion rubles. Ukraine's  debt for Russian fuel increased last month by 440 billion rubles  (in all CIS countries -- by 900 billion).    Sources noted that during the talks which "passed in a  businesslike and friendly atmosphere," in particular, a  timetable for repaying debts for Russian oil was set up, under  which Ukraine will pay Russia 125 million dollars by the end of  May.    As for the debt for Russian gas supplies, in the opinion of  Minsotrudnichestvo officials, close and permanent contacts  between the Russian Gazprom and the Ukrainian Ukrgazprom bring  "positive results."    The sources noted that Gazprom has no intention of cutting  gas supplies to Ukrainian consumers in the near future, although  Ukraine is failing to implement a number of provisions in the  Russian-Ukrainian protocols of March 10 and 12. "This is not  the time for such drastic actions," they noted.    During the talks the two sides agreed to carry out "joint  control" over supplies of Ukrainian equipment and  material-technical resources for repayment of debt to Gazprom  and to speed up the signing of a contract for the construction  of 170,000 square meters of housing for gas workers by Ukrainian  construction organizations.</p>

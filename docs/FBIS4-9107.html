			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Scepan Aleksic] </F>   [Excerpt] Serb positions near Gorazde, 21 Apr (TANJUG) --  Gorazde is neither destroyed nor devastated and any comparison  with the flattened town of Mostar or -- as the Muslim propaganda  likes to present it -- with Vukovar is in complete contrast with  the real situation. A group of journalists who visited the Serb  infantry units on the front line had the opportunity to see the  extent of the deception used by Muslim radio in Sarajevo and the  Western media, which insist that Gorazde is in flames and ruins.  There is a clear view of Gorazde from the Biserna hill on the  right bank of the Drina river about 800 meters from the town  center.    On the river's left bank several floors of the Gradina Hotel  are burned down. Several windows on one of the highest  buildings in the town center are blackened with smoke. The  glass roof on the sports hall is broken. Roofs on several  buildings have been damaged. Minor damage, most likely from  gunfire, can be seen on some buildings, and that is all. True,  there are very few people in the streets and people run when  crossing the bridges. But there is no evidence of any corpses  in the streets, as reported by Muslim radio and the Western  media that has been using it as its source. [Passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Civil servants accept pay deal MEMBERS of three Civil Service unions have accepted offers that will lead to salary rises of between 4 per cent and 4.5 per cent and a significant extension of performance pay. The decisions by the IRSF tax union, the IPMS specialists union and the FDA top civil servants' association mean that only one Civil Service union has yet to settle this year. Most members of the NUCPS accepted the advice of their leaders to accept the pay offer, but reject plans for performance-related pay and devolving pay bargaining to departments. The Treasury subsequently withdrew the offer. Talks with the union are continuing on what will happen next. Senior members of the union, who are covered by a separate arrangement, have voted for acceptance. The decisions by the IPMS, FDA and IRSF were all carried by overwhelming majorities.</p>

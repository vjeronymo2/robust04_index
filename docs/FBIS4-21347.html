			<p>BFN     [Text] Yichang, March 28 (XINHUA) -- Since February this  year, China has started work to harness a dangerous rock  formation within the Three Gorges area on the middle reaches of  the Chang Jiang River where a huge water-control project is to  be built.    Containment measures are being pursued with the aim of  ensuring safe navigation through the Three Gorges area and  protecting the projected reservoir.    The rockface, nicknamed the "Huangla Stone" with a total  volume of 40 million cu m, is located at the juncture of the  Xiling and Xixia gorges and is only 64 km away from the area  where the gigantic water control dam is to be built.    According to experts, the rocky outcrop is the most  dangerous  spot in the Three Gorges, with increasingly frequent slippage  and poor stability in the main body of the rock heightening  concerns over the past few years. Extended rains or a jarring  earthquake in the region would be likely to cause the Huangla  Stone to fall into the Chang Jiang River, triggering waves as  high as 20-80 m to surge along the river.    Moreover, if the rock happens to break loose, it will not  only destroy the Badong County seat and nearby villages and  farmland, but also block the entire navigable route of the  Yangtze, bringing navigation of ships in the area to a  standstill. In addition, several million tons of silt may  follow the landslide into the Yangtze, further worsening water  pollution in the river, said the experts.    The State Council, China's central government, has attached  great attention to the harnessing of the dangerous rock. Before  the official launching of containment work, experts from nine  national organizations were recruited to carry out research on  the feasibility of harnessing the rock.    According to Qu Xingyuan, chief of the headquarters in  charge  of Huangla Stone harnessing, they have adopted the method of  building drainage projects on the surface of the ground and  below the ground, in a bid to improve and enhance the stability  of the rock.    In nearby areas where landslides are most likely to occur,  facilities with the functions of holding water back from the  surfaces and draining water from inside have also been built to  forestall landslides.    So far, more than 500 workers have taken on the harnessing  work, digging out 5,500 cu m of earth and building 2,300 m of  drainage canals. The first-phase harnessing work is expected to  be completed in May.</p>

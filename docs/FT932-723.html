			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Travel: And the Wurlitzer plays on IT SOUNDS an unprepossessing address for a shrine, 706 Union Avenue. But Sun Studio, a modest two-storey brownstone building in downtown Memphis, Tennessee, has a better claim than anywhere to be the place where rock 'n' roll began. The Elvis legend started there in 1953 when the 18-year-old truck-driver with sideburns made a demo record in Sam Phillips's tiny Sun Studio. Sun Studio is now back in the recording business after a neglected period as a garage and a barber shop. It is a guaranteed crowd-puller, and I paid Dollars 4 for the tour. The plastic lights and battered acoustic tiles are the same as 40 years ago. The control booth has been modernised to accommodate the likes of U2 and Ringo Starr, but the intimate atmosphere that produced the breathless, shivering sounds of early Elvis remains intact. Period instruments lie on the studio floor, and I clutched the same upright microphone that Presley used. The humble Sun Studio cafe next door provides the best hamburgers in Memphis, a remarkable Dixie fried banana pie, and a Wurlitzer that only plays Sun singles. Memphis and music are intertwined: the historic Beale Street area has been restored, with plenty of restaurants and music venues, but the raffish reputation of the 1920s, when jug bands and gambling joints were everywhere, has almost disappeared. BB King's blues club had some fine raw soul music the night I went. It also had 100 conventioneering Tennessee realtors. Memphis is rightly proud of its musical heritage, but it is also the home of America's first Civil Rights Museum. The Lorraine Motel, the site of Martin Luther King's assassination in 1968, has been converted into a powerful museum of interpretive exhibits that bring to life the story of the civil rights movement from the 1950s to the present. Martin Luther King's room has been preserved exactly as it was when he was shot on an upper balcony. It is jarring to cross town to Elvis Presley Boulevard on the same day and see Graceland, Presley's home from 1957 until his death. Around 700,000 people tour this 1930s southern-style mansion each year. Only the White House has more visitors. For Dollars 7.95 you get a strictly guided tour. The iron gates are decorated with musical notes and the graffiti of thousands of fans. The guides are a mine of information as they convey you around the two lower levels of the house (Elvis's aunt still lives upstairs). 'This grand piano is covered in gold leaf - a present from Priscilla,' says Sharonda as we gaze across the roped-off living room. The white leather sofas are long enough to accommodate a football team and the Jungle Room is decorated like an Hawaiian cocktail. The Trophy Room catalogues Elvis's career: scores of stage costumes, 300 gold and platinum records, school reports, letters from presidents. Outside, the guitar-shaped swimming pool and a private shooting gallery indicate how Elvis was imprisoned within his own fantasy. An English devotee next to me knelt down to pick up some garden leaves and murmured: 'What a souvenir - genuine Graceland leaves.' The tour ends in the Meditation Garden where Elvis is buried between his parents. The eternal flame on his bronze gravestone is surrounded by guitar-shaped wreaths and tributes freshly placed by fans: 'Elvis, the most beautiful star in the sky. Love from Kiki and Roberta.' It is a three hour-drive along Interstate 40 from West Tennessee to Nashville, a sprawling, amiable city dominated by music. Every waitress seems to be an aspiring Patsy, Tammy or Dolly. Songwriters advertise their wares on telegraph poles: 'Doug Rehm has NEW SONGS for consideration'. Businessmen who have nothing to do with music are knowledgeable about the new country stars like Alan Jackson and Reba McIntyre. Over 200 recording studios and music publishers are scattered around Nashville, but the heartland is along Music Row on 16th Avenue where the Country Music Hall of Fame has exhibits and artefacts. It traces the development of different strands of country music with films and videos, original instruments and manuscripts. Nearby is RCA's legendary Studio B where Elvis recorded 250 songs over 20 years. We gazed at the battered recording console which mixed his songs, as well as those of Jim Reeves, Roy Orbison, the Everlys and Dolly Parton. Back on the highway we headed south-east to pay tribute to two other Tennessee landmarks - Jack Daniel's distillery and Chattanooga. Mister Jack put a small village called Lynchburg on the map in the 1860s when he began distilling his unique 'sour mash' with the help of a spring water stream and charcoal filtering. Paradoxically, Lynchburg is a 'dry area': our guide warned us at the start of our walk round the distillery that it would be a 'sniffing, not a drinking tour.' We smelt the vats, we saw the iron-free spring water and the whisky seeping drop by drop through the maplewood charcoal. We even saw hillside warehouses packed with 47m gallons of Jack Daniel's. But there was not a drop to drink until we crossed the county line, seven miles away. Further east, Chattanooga sprawls along the Moccasin Bend of the Tennessee River at the foot of Lookout Mountain. The Chattanooga Choo-Choo, Track 29 and the terminal station are all now part of a Holiday Inn complex: restored railway sleeping cars have become restaurants. Ten miles south of the city, America's oldest national military park at Chickamauga commemorates the bloodiest battle of the Civil War in 1863, when Union and Confederate armies fought to gain control of the key rail centre of Chattanooga with the loss of 35,000 lives. Even today bullets are sometimes found in the dense woodland and undergrowth. Finally, I needed no urging to travel on to East Tennessee where the Great Smoky Mountains straddle the border with North Carolina for 60 miles. The bluish mist which clings to the mountainsides and gave the peaks their name is turning increasingly grey because of pollution, but the Smokies have earned their title of the 'crown jewels of the Appalachians' because of the exceptional variety of trees, flowers and wildlife in this superb national park. If you find a traffic hold-up on a mountain road here, it is almost certain to be the result of a 'bear jam': 500 black bears live in the park and tourists leap out of their cars to snap them whenever they appear among the greenery. Richard Gilbert travelled with American Airlines Holidays, which offers various flexible fly-drive packages to Nashville on scheduled flights from Heathrow, Gatwick, Stanstead, Manchester and Glasgow via Chicago or Dallas.

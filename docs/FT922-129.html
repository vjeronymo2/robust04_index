			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / International Company News: State orders inquiry into Thai Airways THAILAND'S caretaker government has ordered an investigation into seven allegations of corruption at Thai Airways International (Thai), the national airline whose shares are due to start trading on the country's stock exchange next month. One of the deals under investigation is Thai's order of Rolls-Royce engines for a fleet of new Boeing 777s, a choice which government officials said could increase maintenance costs because the airline normally uses General Electric or Pratt and Whitney engines. Thai, which is run as a fiefdom of the air force, has often been accused privately of making questionable deals and of buying too varied a range of equipment, but the state's sale of 7 per cent of the airline to the public earlier this year has led to renewed calls for the company to be managed more professionally. Furthermore, the interim government installed this month has publicly committed itself to reducing the influence of the armed forces in business and politics. Air Chief Marshal Kaset Rojananil, Thai's chairman, is head of the air force and military supreme commander, and has been blamed by pro-democracy demonstrators for the violence in May in which troops shot dead at least 50 protestors. Some employees of Thai have called for his resignation. The other deals under investigation on the orders of Mr Nukul Prachuabmoh, the transport and communications minister, are: the sale of six Shorts aircraft to Bangkok Airways, an airline with links to the military, for less than the price offered by a rival bidder; waiving Thai's rights to fly to Cambodia in favour of Bangkok Airways; the lease of a luxury executive Challenger jet; plans to buy a plot of land from the wife of a senior air force officer for what is seen as an unusually high price; overpaying for another plot of land; and buying expensive limousines for executives two days before the announcement of a cost-cutting programme. Thai yesterday declined to comment on the allegations, the latest in a series of blows for the company. Net profit in the busy first half ended March 31 was only Bt1.2bn (Dollars 47.2m), compared with a forecast in the prospectus for the full year of Bt5.3bn. The second half began dismally with the political violence in May, which caused a sharp fall in tourist arrivals and in Thai's passenger loads on international flights. The privatisation in March was clouded by suggestions that some of the 100m shares offered were withheld and sold at a premium over the Bt60 offer price by senior Thai executives or their associates. On the grey market, Thai shares rose to about Bt90, but have now fallen back to be bid at about Bt65, reflecting investors' doubts about Thai's management and profitability. The shares are due to start trading on July 20 although some brokers fear further delay.</p>

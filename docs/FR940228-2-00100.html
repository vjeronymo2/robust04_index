(70&hyph;8096) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> DQE, Inc. (``DQE''), P.O. Box 68, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15230&hyph;0068, and its wholly owned subsidiary company, Duquesne Enterprises, Inc. (``DE''), Grant Building, 330 Grant Street, suite 2420, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15219, both Pennsylvania public-utility holding companies exempt from registration under section 3(a)(1) of the Act pursuant to Rule 2, have filed an application under sections 9(a)(2) and 10 of the Act in connection with the acquisition of Allegheny Development Corporation (``ADC''), a wholly owned subsidiary of DE, that operates an energy services business. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DQE was organized in 1989 for the purpose of becoming a holding company for Duquesne Light Company (``DLC''), an electric utility company, and other energy-related subsidiaries. DLC is engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electric energy and serves an area of approximately 800 square miles which includes the City of Pittsburgh. DE's subsidiaries other than ADC are engaged in real estate ventures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1987 a competitive bidding process was initiated by the County of Allegheny, Pennsylvania (``County'') for the design, installation and operation of facilities to provide a complete energy services package to the new Midfield Terminal Complex being developed to replace the then existing airline terminal at the Greater Pittsburgh International Airport (``Airport''). DLC was the supplier of electric energy to the Airport at that time. The applicants state that DLC, a utility subject to the jurisdiction of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, was not in a position to submit a competitive bid; however, it was important to participate in the bidding to avoid the loss of a significant DLC customer when the Airport ceased operation. Consequently, ADC then a wholly-owned subsidiary of DLC, submitted a bid to the County and was awarded the contract out of a field of 12 bidders. As a result, ADC became a public utility company within the meaning of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On July 7, 1989, DLC became a wholly-owned subsidiary of QE by virtue of a merger transaction. ADC was still a wholly-owned subsidiary of DLC. An Energy Services Agreement (``Agreement'') dated May 31, 1989 between the County and ADC was entered into on July 27, 1989. In December 1989, DLC distributed all of the stock of ADC to DQE as a dividend and later in December 1989, DQE contributed the ADC stock to the capital of DE. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agreement requires ADC to supply all of the electrical and thermal requirements of the Midfield Terminal Complex, including electricity, hot water and chilled water. ADC purchases electricity at tariff rates from DLC and sells a portion to the County at the unit costs specified in the Agreement. The County also is required to pay to ADC an annual fixed charge related to ADC's investment in the facilities. The County is the sole customer for the energy services provided by ADC. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

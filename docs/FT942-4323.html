			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / People: Salomon sends Berens to UK Salomon Brothers is sending one of its biggest hitters to London as part of its drive to raise the firm's profile in European equity markets. Rodney Berens, 48, a member of Salomon Brothers' 12-strong executive committee, is currently co-head of the US equity department with Bruce Hackett. Stephen Posford, chief executive officer of Salomon Brothers' European operations, is looking forward to working with Berens to come up with a winning formula to make Salomon as well known in the equities business as it is in fixed-income and derivatives. 'It won't be a bums-on-seats strategy,' says Posford. Rather, the emphasis will be on sector-driven research and close co-ordination between Salomon's European operations and the US investment banking arm. Berens will also provide valuable access to Salomon's equity salesforce in New York, Posford adds. Berens is expected to spend a good part of each month in London over the summer but crucial decisions such as his children's education are likely to delay his transfer until the end of the year. Before joining Salomon in 1992 in the wake of the Treasury scandal, he was in charge of global research at Morgan Stanley.</p>

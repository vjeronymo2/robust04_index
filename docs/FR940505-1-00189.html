			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Currently, there is no technological basis to prepare full regulations to achieve this additional level of control. Instead, the additional reductions will need to come from either new technologies or further improvements to existing technologies, such as those discussed in section III.B.5.d.iii. The federal control technology projects described in that section are current examples of federal initiatives supporting the development and commercialization of low-emitting products and technologies, pollution prevention approaches, and new control techniques. In each future year, additional federal projects will be undertaken which should help to provide the technical, commercial, and regulatory basis for the emission reductions needed for attainment in the South Coast.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In these circumstances, EPA believes it is appropriate to make federal commitments to promulgate in the future regulations based on the development of new technologies or control techniques, as authorized in section 182(e)(5) of the Act. Section III.B.5.c.4. of this NPRM discusses extensively this CAA section and provides the prerequisite demonstration that the new technology measures are not needed to meet the incremental reduction requirements for the period 1990&hyph;2000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Commitment to adopt measures and schedule of emission reductions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's policy for implementation of section 182(e)(5) demands a commitment from the responsible agencies to achieve specified reductions by particular dates. The Act also explicitly requires a commitment to adopt contingency measures no later than 3 years before the scheduled reductions from the new technology provisions (section 182(e)(5)(B)). The contingency measures must be adequate, in combination with other controls, to achieve the periodic emission reduction requirements and attainment. EPA's commitments to both the new technology measures and the contingency measures appears at proposed 40 CFR 52.2951.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> a. Stationary and Area Sources.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Sources Subject to Cap Rules. EPA proposes to make section 182(e)(5) commitments to prepare rules for each of the control categories covered by the cap rules described above in section III.C.5. The commitments are identical for each stationary and area source category, and establish rulemaking and implementation schedules to achieve two additional increments of reduction beyond the sources' baseline emissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For VOC the schedule is as follows. At the beginning of 2005, the declining cap rule will have required sources to reduce baseline emissions by between 20 and 45 percent. The first new technology rule will be proposed by January 1, 2004, and promulgated by January 1, 2005, and will require a 60 percent reduction from baseline emissions by January 1, 2007. The second new technology rule will be proposed by January 1, 2006, and promulgated by January 1, 2007, and will require a 90 percent reduction from baseline emissions by January 1, 2009.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The schedule for NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is similar. At the beginning of 2005, the SCAQMD regulations, including the NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  RECLAIM rules, will have achieved substantial reductions in baseline emissions. The first new technology rule will be proposed by January 1, 2004, and promulgated by January 1, 2005, and will require a 50 percent reduction from baseline emissions by January 1, 2007. The second new technology rule will be proposed by January 1, 2006, and promulgated by January 1, 2007, and will require a 70 percent reduction from baseline emissions by January 1, 2009.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Consumer Products, Architectural Coatings, and Pesticides. For the consumer products (including aerosol paints), architectural coatings, and pesticides categories, including those sources subject to the proposed provisions of 40 CFR 52.2957, 40 CFR 2958, 40 CFR 52.2959, and 40 CFR 52.2960, EPA proposes to make section 182(e)(5) commitments to prepare new technology rules to reduce VOC emissions by a further increment of 80 percent, beyond the control level achieved under the proposed FIP statewide rules cited above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The schedule for rule promulgation and compliance is as follows. The first new technology rule will be proposed by January 1, 2004, and promulgated by January 1, 2005, and will require a 40 percent reduction from baseline (year 2003) emissions by January 1, 2007. The second new technology rule will be proposed by January 1, 2006, and promulgated by January 1, 2007, and will require an 80 percent reduction from baseline emissions by January 1, 2009.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Remaining Stationary and Area Sources. For remaining stationary and area emission sources emitting less than 4 tons per year and not already regulated under sections III.G.2.a.(1) or III.G.2.a.(2), EPA proposes to make section 182(e)(5) commitments to prepare new technology rules to reduce VOC emissions by 80 percent from baseline emission levels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Emission sources regulated under this section represent a large number of small sources which emit less than 4 tons per year and/or may be exempt from regulation. These sources account for an estimated 300 tons per day of the remaining VOC emissions after application of currently proposed FIP regulations. These sources include but are not limited to gasoline service stations, livestock waste operations, commercial food production and preparation, printing shops, miscellaneous coating and solvent cleaning operations, miscellaneous chemical/product manufacturing, bakeries, waste disposal sites (e.g., landfills), publicly owned treatment works, waste burning operations, miscellaneous fuel combustion sources, and miscellaneous fugitive emission sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The schedule for rule promulgation and compliance is as follows. The first new technology rule will be proposed by January 1, 2004, and promulgated by January 1, 2005, and will require a 40 percent reduction from baseline (year 2003) emissions by January 1, 2007. The second new technology rule will be proposed by January 1, 2006, and promulgated by January 1, 2007, and will require an 80 percent reduction from baseline emissions by January 1, 2009.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

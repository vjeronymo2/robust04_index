			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> PEREGRINE FALCON WINNING QUEST FOR SURVIVAL  </P> <P> The peregrine falcon, once reduced to fewer than 100 pairs in the United  States, is making a comeback as hundreds swoop off cliffs, ledges and, in many  cases, skyscrapers.  </P> <P> After 15 years and millions of dollars, conservationists say the birds soon  won't need special protection, possibly by 1995. But they worry that Congress  and others will decide that time is now.  </P> <P> "It's progressed marvelously. It's probably not true that the bird is widely  endangered now," said Jim Enderson, a Colorado College biologist who heads a  federal peregrine recovery team.  </P> <P> "It's been a model program nationally," said Brad Blodget, Massachusetts' state  ornithologist. "It's a victory story."  </P> <P> Within five years, Enderson said, the government could probably "down-list" the  bird from endangered to threatened, or even take it off the lists altogether.  </P> <P> This is big news for the peregrine. Once totaling about 300 pairs in the East  and many more in the West, the falcon population was hard hit in the 1950s by  DDT and other insecticides. By 1975, there were no falcons known to survive on  the East Coast, and fewer than 100 pairs were counted in the entire continental  United States.  </P> <P> "We were basically starting from zero," Blodget said.  </P> <P> Groups such as the Boise, Ida.-based Peregrine Fund set about reintroducing the  falcon, importing hatchlings from Canada, Scotland, Argentina and other  countries.  </P> <P> The federal government, which banned DDT for nearly all purposes, earmarked  about $300,000 a year for captive falcon breeding. Some states even put  check-off options on tax forms to extend a portion of rebates to peregrine  recovery.  </P> <P> Nationally, the efforts have cost "many millions of dollars," said Bill  Burnham, president of the Peregrine Fund, which spends about $800,000 a year on  peregrine recovery.  </P> <P> "It's a lot cheaper to take care of the environment, rather than trying to go  in afterward and put them back after you lose them," he said.  </P> <P> Falcon recovery cost so much in part because it entails more than just  releasing an Argentine bird in Montana. Mortality rates are as high as 50% in  the bird's first year, and remain at about 15% through its lifetime, Burnham  said.  </P> <P> The Peregrine Fund will release its 3,000th falcon this year, Burnham said. In  California, where more than 500 birds were released in the 1980s, 90 pairs  exist, up from eight pairs in 1975.  </P> <P> Today, there are more than 540 falcon pairs in the United States. Almost 100  pairs are in the Grand Canyon alone. In the Northeast, at least 85 pairs have  been counted, while about 17 pairs are known in the Midwest.  </P> <P> "As long as the pesticide situation does not change for the worse, it's  unlikely that this bird is going to be in trouble in the foreseeable future,"  Enderson said.  </P> <P> Other conservationists are more cautious.  </P> <P> "We're about two-thirds of the way there," Burnham said. "As far as the release  of the peregrines go, there's probably a need for another six to seven years."  </P> <P> The birds remain scarce in some places, such as Idaho, where only three pairs  are known. So, conservationists say, they are keeping anxious eyes on  Washington, hoping Congress does not pull the plug too soon.  </P> <P> "One of the worst things you can do is put a lot of energy into restoration and  then stop it," said Tom French, who heads the Massachusetts endangered species  program.  </P> <P> As they are reintroduced to modern society, some peregrines are showing a taste  for urban life, where high-rise buildings resemble their preferred high cliffs  and rocky ledges.  </P> <P> Nine pairs swoop and dive among the skyscrapers and sloping bridges of New York  City, while in Springfield, Mass., peregrines nesting on a 23-story building  have become stars of a local cable television show.  </P> <P> But with the falcon's new surroundings have come modern hazards such as high  wires, airplanes and plate-glass windows. Conservationists say too many  collisions with planes or decapitations by wires could cripple breeding  efforts.  </P> <P> "Last year one of the adult males flew over the airport and was hit by an  airplane and killed, right in the middle of breeding season," said Pat Redig,  who heads the Midwest-based Raptor Center. "I've seen those things happen with  enough frequency to cause me to be concerned about the fragility of our  population."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ernesto Samper, presidential candidate of </F> Colombia's Liberal Party, by unidentified reporter and Caracol  News Director Dario Arizmendi from the Gonzalo Jimenez de  Quesada Convention Center in Santa Fe de Bogota--live]    [Text] [Reporter] Greetings from Caracol Network and  congratulations for your victory today.    [Samper] Thank you. I am very pleased with this victory and  for the opportunity to offer to Colombians, as I said today, a  government of cohesion and social commitment.    [Reporter] You said there were similarities with Andres  Pastrana's campaign concerning peace, social justice, and  progress. Does that mean you could call some of Pastrana's  followers to work with you in those three fields?    [Samper] I believe all Colombians coincide in those fields.  All possibilities of cooperation are welcome as long as we can  agree.    [Reporter] I know you asked me to be brief, but Dario  Arizmendi wants to greet you from our studios.    [Arizmendi] Congratulations, and greetings to Ernesto Samper  Pizano; we sincerely say this, because we know how he carried  out his campaign, the difficulties he had to overcome. We wish  him success, because his success will also be Colombia's.    [Samper] Thank you, Dario, for your message. I also  reiterate my gratitude to Caracol and other networks for the  wide coverage they gave my campaign. That was the best  contribution they could give to democracy.    [Arizmendi] Thank you, President-elect Ernesto Samper  Pizano.  This was the president-elect's first interview in Colombia.    [Reporter] I would like to ask the president-elect when he  plans to accompany the soccer team representing Colombia at the  World Cup to the United States.    [Samper] We will see. I will begin the transition process  tomorrow, and I hope to have the opportunity this same week. I  tried to call Maturana and El Pibe today to dedicate to them  this victory, which somewhat compensates the setback we had last  night. I want to tell them I hope this victory will encourage  them, so that on 22 June they can give all Colombians the good  news on the World Cup.    [Arizmendi] Will you be there on 22 or 26 June?    [Samper] I do not have travel plans yet. I believe I may  decide tomorrow.    [Arizmendi] When will you announce your cabinet, on 7 August  or before?    [Samper] We will see. For now, I will sit down to prepare a  transition plan to guarantee continuity. I already had the  opportunity to talk with President Gaviria twice this afternoon.  I hope we can meet again this week to continue working in that  direction.    [Arizmendi] Did you talk with Andres Pastrana by telephone?    [Samper] No. I have not had the opportunity to greet him.    [Arizmendi] Did you hear his speech conceding defeat and  recognizing your victory?    [Samper] Yes, Dario, I did hear it.    [Arizmendi] What are your comments about Pastrana's speech?    [Samper] I believe Pastrana has created a very important  political opening, because 3.5 million votes are a very  interesting figure that reflects the support he received. I am  sure he will use that opening to benefit the activities he  proposed during his campaign; to that effect, he can also count  on my support.    [Arizmendi] What does that support mean? A representation in  your cabinet, if he agrees, as you mentioned in your speech?    [Samper] Yes. The decision on cooperation will depend on the  position Pastrana adopts.    [Arizmendi] Pastrana said he also offered his cooperation to  Colombia, in other words, to your government and that he  recognized your victory. Will you then directly invite  Pastrana's friends and representatives?    [Samper] We will sit down and decide this later on. Right  now we are celebrating our victory, but tomorrow we will begin  our political contacts.    [Arizmendi] What was your most difficult moment today? Were  you confident of your victory, or did you have any doubts?    [Samper] I remained calm at all times. I learned this week I  had good opportunities to win, something that did, in fact,  occur.    [Arizmendi] Did you learn about the results of the exit poll  conducted by the Caracol Network and the National Consultative  Center?    [Samper] Yes I did, and I understand the figures are very  similar to the ones released by the National Registrar.    [Arizmendi] What will be the first thing the president-elect  will do tomorrow after this historic night?    [Samper] I will sit down to talk with my working teams  tomorrow. I have some commitments with the international media.  I will give them as many interviews as possible, because I  believe we must take advantage of this opportunity to let others  know more about our country and the plans of the next government.    [Arizmendi] To whom do you dedicate your victory?    [Samper] To Colombian democracy and all Colombians, for whom  I have struggled all my life.    [Arizmendi] You won by a wide margin in Santa Fe de Bogota  and practically in all the departments along the Atlantic Coast.  Will they benefit the most from your victory?    [Samper] No. I am not going to discriminate. I will govern  for all regions and for all Colombians.</p>

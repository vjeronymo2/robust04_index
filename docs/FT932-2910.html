			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / International Company News: Movenpick may be exposed to SFr5m claims MOVENPICK, the Swiss hotel and restaurant chain, yesterday said that Mr Wolfgang vom Hagen, its former chief executive officer, may have exposed it to claims of up to SFr5m (Dollars 3.4m). The directors said they have over a dozen cases involving staff appointments and dismissals and other alleged violations of company law committed by Mr vom Hagen that could lead to claims. The statement alleged that Mr vom Hagen had given orders to external consultants without the knowledge of the management board, leading to charges of about SFr30,000 per working day in 1992 but no results.</p>

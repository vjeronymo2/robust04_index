			<p><P> January 22, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> 'ICE' LAB RAIDED, DRUG SEIZED, 5 HELD  </P> <P> Detectives seized what they say is the first laboratory for making "ice," or  smokable methamphetamine, in the continental United States and arrested five  people, sheriff's deputies said. County and state narcotics agents found the  laboratory in nearby Elk Grove containing four pounds of "ice" in various  production stages and four gallons of liquid that would convert to 32 pounds of  "ice", said Sheriff's Department spokesman Ed Close.  </P> <P> The current price of "ice" in Los Angeles is $10,000 to $15,000 a pound, he  said. In Hawaii, where use of the drug is widespread, the price is $50,000 a  pound, he said. U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration chemists said it was the  first "ice" lab seized in the continental United States and that the quality of  the drug was very high. Arrested on charges of conspiracy to transport,  possession for sale of and manufacture for sale of methamphetamine were John  Skific, 28, William Vick, 38, Barbara Vick, 30, Bridgette Wisdom, 23, and  Kimberly Vick, 18, all of Sacramento.  </P></p>

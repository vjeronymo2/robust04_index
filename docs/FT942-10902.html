			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / World News in Brief: Footsie unchanged after erratic session London's equity market survived Conservative local election losses and put up a strong defence in the face of a steep fall in US stocks and bonds, which reacted to a much higher than expected increase in US employment. The FT-SE 100 index began the session around five points higher and gradually improved to stand more than 15 points ahead before the US figures were announced, after which it dropped through the 3,100 level. It recovered slowly to close unchanged at 3,106.0. London stocks, Page 15; Lex, Page 24; Markets, Weekend II</p>

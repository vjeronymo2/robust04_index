			<p><P> June 26, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FLORIDA GUN LAW  </P> <P> How enlightened of the Florida legislature to consider a law recognizing that  children don't kill children, guns kill children (to paraphrase the National  Rifle Assn.'s favorite platitude) (Part I, June 16). How open-minded of the NRA  to support that law in the face of almost certain passage. How stupid we all  are, allowing the paranoid NRA to continually prevent reasonable firearm  control.  </P> <P> Too little, too late, Florida, for the five children and many others who have  paid the price for our right to own "adult" toys.  </P> <P> ALLAN RABINOWITZ  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

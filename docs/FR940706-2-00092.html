			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The original sample contained representative samples of new Social Security beneficiaries who filed for benefits as retired workers, disabled workers, wives, widows, divorced wives, and surviving divorced wives. There was also a representative sample of persons aged 65 and over who were entitled to Medicare benefits but who had not yet received Social Security cash benefits. The aged sample was, for the most part, in its mid- to late-60's in 1982 and in its mid- to late-70's in 1991. Some of the sample members were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affected by the ``notch'' that was created when legislation was enacted to correct for an overcompensation in the benefit formula for inflation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The original interview covered a wide range of topics, including demographic characteristics, marital and childbearing history, employment history, current income (in the format of the SIPP) and assets, and health. The followup interview, in addition to asking many of the same questions as the original interview, collected a history of critical events since 1982 (such as widowhood or divorce, work cessation, migration, and the sale of the home) and the financial impact of these critical events. The original health items of work disability, functional capacity, and presence of major diseases were expanded to assess specific Activities of Daily Living and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living, private health insurance provisions, and the longest experience in a long-term care facility. Disabled workers who returned to work were asked about their job search experience, employer accommodations to their disability, and their use of vocational and rehabilitation services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Background material and a compilation of reports based on the 1982 New Beneficiary Survey are available. These reports were also published in various editions of the Social Security Bulletin from 1983 to 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Using the NBDS, the following projects will be considered for funding:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Understanding How Aged Beneficiaries Become Poor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although poverty rates among the aged have declined substantially over the last 30 years, there are still some troublesome problems and poverty among aged women is a particular concern. Various legislative proposals have been made or discussed to improve the treatment of women under the Social Security program, including care-giving credits, increasing benefits at some age, eliminating the actuarial reduction for early benefit receipt at some age, modifying the Social Security special minimum benefit, and redesigning couple benefits in order to enhance survivor benefits. However, many of the proposals are not well targeted to the poor. Proposals for research are sought to increase our understanding of why aged beneficiaries, and especially aged women, become poor, which will improve our ability to form policy in this area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some of the key research questions are: To what extent is aged poverty a continuation of a lifetime of low income? To what extent is aged poverty a result of aged couples decumulating assets as they age? What are the economic effects of widowhood, including the extent to which sources of income are lost or reduced, and the extent to which high health care expenditures surrounding the death of a spouse are a major cause of high poverty rates among the aged who have become widowed? Is the type of social security benefit received (retired worker benefits, wife or widow benefits, worker benefits that are supplemented because of entitlement to a higher spouse or survivor benefit and those that are not, retirement benefits that were converted from a disability benefit at age 65 and those that were not) related to differing poverty rates in 1982, and are those patterns the same among beneficiaries 10 years later? How different is the role of major sources of income (including social security, other pensions, asset income, earnings, and Supplemental Security Income_an SSA-administered ``safety net'' program) in 1991 than it was in 1982?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Changing Economic Status of Individuals With Disabilities and Their Families  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We know that newly disabled individuals in 1982 were less well-off than newly retired individuals in terms of both income and assets. However, little or no research has been done to follow disabled individuals over time to determine whether they have particular problems maintaining an adequate standard of living. The well-being of many individuals with disabilities depends not only on their own income but also on the income and/or services provided by family members, such as the earnings of spouses, or help with activities of daily living that may mean the difference between living in the community and having to be institutionalized.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

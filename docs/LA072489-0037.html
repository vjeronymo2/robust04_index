			<p><P> July 24, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TURNBULL LEAVES NO DOUBT IN RECORD RUN;  </P> <P> HE SHATTERS MARK IN 800 METERS AT MASTERS EVENT  </P> <P> When Derek Turnbull completed his 60-64 age-group heat of the 800 meters in  2:14.90 Thursday, he shattered the world record of 2:17 set by Australian John  Gilmour in 1981.  </P> <P> A world record? Well, yes and no. Turnbull knew there was still a small matter  to be cleared up. During the 1985 World Games in Rome, fellow New Zealander  Frank Evans ran a 2:14.02, but it was never officially recorded because the  Italian organizers never filed the required paper work.  </P> <P> On Sunday during the TAC/USA Masters National Championships at San Diego State,  Turnbull easily outran Evans to take first place in the 800 finals with a time  of 2:12.62, which effectively erases any preceding error in the record books.  </P> <P> "Derek's my arch-enemy on the track," Evans said. "And he took all doubt (about  who's the fastest 60-64-year-old 800 runner) away today."  </P> <P> It should be pointed out that when Evans turned in his 2:14.02 he was just 60  years old. Turnbull is 62. In other words, Turnbull is two years past the prime  record-setting age. What has made a difference for him at this meet (he has  also won the 5,000 meters and set a world record in the 1,500 meters) has been  preparation and increased competition.  </P> <P> "I thought I could do it in my condition," Turnbull said of the records. "I'm  starting to get faster all the time because of better competition."  </P> <P> The fact that Turnbull preceded the meet with six weeks of running marathons up  and down the West Coast also aided his efforts.  </P> <P> "He gave himself six weeks and this is the result," Evans said.  </P> <P> There were two other record-setting 800-meter runs. In the women's 65-69 group,  Mary Story's finish in 3:08.21 was good for a world mark, and in the women's  40-44 group, Sue Holton set an American record at 2:21.91.  </P> <P> One other 800 meters of note was the men's 40-44 race won by Nolan Smith in  1:58.25. Smith, who had not competed since he was 35, came from last place  among nine runners in the final 120 yards to edge Richard Tucker (1:58.44) and  Ronald Jensen (1:58.47). He did all this while fighting back asthma-related  breathing problems.  </P> <P> "I knew if I had a chance to start slow, I could win it," said Smith, a trumpet  player who has toured with Stevie Wonder, Dianna Ross and Count Basie. "And  luckily the first lap was slow. . . . I felt like a longshot until after the  first lap when I saw we finished in 59 seconds. Then I knew I had it made."  </P> <P> The featured events of the fourth and final day of the meet were the age-graded  100-meter dashes. All winners of the age-group 100-meter races ran against one  another and were given "handicaps" in meters depending on their age.  </P> <P> The women's winner was Irene Obera, 55, of Palo Alto. She completed her 78.7  meters in 10.91, beating Great Britain's Una Gore (who ran 80.7 meters in  11.14).  </P> <P> The men's winner was Bill Collins, 38. Collins had to make up a 6.3-meter  stagger-start on second-place finisher, Ken Dennis, 52; and an 18.4-meter  stagger on third-place finisher Payton Jordan, 72.  </P> <P> Collins clocked a 10.30 95.2 meters to barely defeat Dennis (10.37, 88.9  meters) and Jordan (10.41, 76.8 meters) in a photo finish.  </P></p>

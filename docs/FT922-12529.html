			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Tarmac profits fall 90% to Pounds 21m after provisions TARMAC, the UK's largest housebuilder, yesterday continued the string of poor results from construction companies when it announced sharply lower operating profits and large provisions. Pre-tax profits fell nearly 90 per cent to Pounds 21m from Pounds 190.7m a year ago. The company is recommending a cut in its final dividend to 2.5p from 8.25p making uncovered total of 5.5p, less than half last time's 11.25p. The shares fell 6p to 139p. Mr Neville Simms, who took over as chief executive earlier this year, said 1992 was expected to remain difficult with interim profits well down on last time's Pounds 18.2m. He said a key objective was to reduce debt, which increased more than 10 per cent to Pounds 456.9m and took the company's debt/equity ratio to 51 per cent if dollar denominated auction market preferred stock was included as debt. Tarmac wants to cut the ratio to about 25 per cent, suggesting more than Pounds 200m in assets are up for sale. Disposals are likely in industrial products, building products and in Tarmac America. Over the past two years Tarmac cut its workforce 16 per cent, or more than 5,000 jobs. Rationalisation costs last year totalled Pounds 12.3m. Turnover fell to Pounds 3.23bn from Pounds 3.61bn due to reduced volumes in most businesses. The quarry products division was affected by price competition, leading to reduced margins. Housing sales fell nearly 2,000 units to 9,327 in the UK, although average prices increased slightly to Pounds 77,100. Timing for upturn in the housing market remained uncertain, although Mr Simms said Easter would provide a pointer to whether the election result had improved consumer confidence. Profits before exceptional items fell to Pounds 60m from Pounds 190.7m. The company is making exceptional provisions of Pounds 45m including a Pounds 12m charge for its share of the Channel tunnel, and Pounds 10m to cover falling land values. Sales of Eurotunnel warrants made an exceptional profit of Pounds 6m. Earnings fell to 0.2p from 16.7p. Profits attributable to shareholders fell to Pounds 12.9m from Pounds 144.4m. Following the dividend charge, there was a retained loss of Pounds 38.6m against Pounds 59.9m profit. Details Page 22, Lex, Page 20</p>

Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata in his address at the  Diet some time ago described foreign press reports about Japan's  pursuit of nuclear armament as "groundless," saying that Japan  has "three non-nuclear principles" banning the manufacture,  possession and introduction of nuclear weapons. And Morihiro  Hosokawa stated that Japan would keep to the "three non-nuclear  principles."    The news analyst of the paper dismisses their assertions as  verbal pyrotechnics to get out of the tight corner in which  Japan faces worldwide criticism as a nuclear culprit.    The commentary says:    As for the "three non-nuclear principles" which the Japanese  Government uses as an evidence for its "nuclear uprightness,"  they are nominal as they are not codified and specify no penalty  on their violations.    Never have the "three non-nuclear principles" been observed  since they were laid down by the Japanese Government in the  1960s.    U.S. warships and planes loaded with nuclear weapons  frequent Japanese sea ports and airports, as if they were their  own. Japan, however, has never inspected them, nor has the  conversion of the Japanese territory into a nuclear base of the  United States been raised as a problem.    The "three non-nuclear principles" are used today as a  smokescreen to conceal Japan's nuclear armament.    The Japanese Government is putting up the signboard of  "three  non-nuclear principles" in an effort to relieve the Japanese  people of their concern over nuclear armament at home and make  Japan appear a "non-nuclear peace state" externally.    Behind the curtain of these "principles" Japan as  stockpiling  a colossal amount of plutonium to rank itself among the nuclear  powers. It has finished preparations for the manufacture of  nuclear weapons and developed by itself and launched a space  rocket capable of carrying nuclear warheads.    Japan plans to dispatch its Armed Forces to wide areas of  the  world and is accelerating its nuclear armament and its  conversion into a military power to realise its dominationist  ambition with strength.    If the Japanese authorities resort to double-dealing  tactics,  letting out a string of poor excuses, they will face a bitterer  criticism from the world people.</p>

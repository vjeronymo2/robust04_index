			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ;  </P> <P> SWINGING THROUGH THE AGES  </P> <P>  When Peggy Gilbert put her group the Dixie Belles together 15 years ago, she  says, "I never dreamed that we'd keep it up, because of our ages."  </P> <P> She was 70 at the time. But at age 85, Gilbert is still going strong, and so is  the rest of her six-piece all-female jazz band. Though the youngest member of  the group is 69 years old, the Dixie Belles keep a busy schedule, averaging  between two and three shows a week. Those can range from Palm Springs senior  dances to the Monterey Jazz Festival to appearances on "The Tonight Show" and  "Golden Girls." They will perform Saturday at the Yorba Linda Forum Theater.  </P> <P> For all the Dixie Belles -- leader, tenor sax player and singer Gilbert,  pianist Georgia Shilling, drummer and singer Jerrie Thill, clarinetist Natalie  Robin, trumpeter Mariam Wells and bassist Pearl Powers -- the active gigging is  merely a continuation of the life they've known for decades. According to  Gilbert, most are veterans of name swing bands, including the all-female  outfits of bandleaders Ina Ray Hutton, Ada Leonard and Gilbert's own L.A.-based  band of the '30s.  </P> <P> An 85-year-old lady blowing lively, Coleman Hawkins-influenced tenor sax is no  more unusual than the idea of a woman playing jazz at all was in the late '20s,  when Gilbert started.  </P> <P> Speaking by phone from her Studio City home, Gilbert said she was set on a  career playing jazz saxophone by the time she was out of high school in her  native Sioux City, Iowa. Not that school was any help. Gilbert said girl  players weren't allowed to play wind instruments in the school bands, being  relegated instead to the "womanly" violin, piano and harp.  </P> <P> She instead took sax lessons from a local bandleader and played her first  professional gig in her brother Orville's band in 1926. Not long after, she  started her own all-female band in Sioux City called the Melody Girls.  </P> <P> "Of course, women musicians were not accepted to play with male bands for a  long time," she said, "and that was the reason in the first place for the  all-girl orchestras. They had to get together and form their own bands because  there was nowhere else to play. They were called 'all-girl' bands in those  days, and that's why I keep using that term. Now they like to be called women  musicians instead of girls."  </P> <P> Gilbert moved to Los Angeles in 1928 and promptly formed another band. Though  she said she always got along well with male musicians, being accepted by club  owners was another matter. Asked if the female musicians felt pressure to prove  themselves to audiences, Gilbert said, "Always. We always had to be not 'as  good as,' but better than the men to prove that we could play. And we did win  audiences over. It wasn't until the '40s, though, that women musicians began to  really be accepted."  </P> <P> Despite the obstacles, Gilbert had a successful time. Her band found regular  work in the ballrooms -- she recalls one show at L.A.'s Palomar Ballroom  sharing the bill with Benny Goodman, Tommy Dorsey and other greats -- and such  clubs as Ciros and the Club New Yorker, as well as touring nationally.  </P> <P> "We were playing theaters coast to coast all the time. It was a great time in  the music business," Gilbert said, though she also allowed, "Sometimes it was  difficult. If you're doing one-nighters and playing ballrooms you have to  travel during the day and sometimes would get in just in time to go on the  bandstand."  </P> <P> In 1938 she led the all-woman staff band at radio station KMPC and in 1942 was  a weekly part of the wartime CBS Victory Belles program. She hasn't stopped  yet.  </P> <P> "Jazz has never really gone out," Gilbert maintains, "Of course, we don't make  the money the rock bands do. They're the ones with the limos and we're the ones  driving station wagons."  </P> <P> Does she feel playing music helps keep one feeling young?  </P> <P> "Oh my, I should say so. Do you ever happen to think what the world would be  without it? I keep thinking 'How long can I last?' But as long as I can keep  playing music, I want to. A while ago People magazine asked our trumpet player  how long she would keep playing, and she said, 'As long as I have my teeth.' "  </P></p>

			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Crimean president ends MP lock-out The president of Crimea, a breakaway region of Ukraine, yesterday ended a lock-out of the contested region's parliament but the local power struggle remained unresolved. The tug-of-war between Crimea's parliament and president, a re-run on a smaller scale of the dramatic battle in Russia last autumn, escalated over the week-end when Mr Yuri Meshkov, the Crimean president, locked members of parliament out of their parliament building. Yesterday, after deputies and their supporters seized control of the local television station, Mr Meshkov relented. However, deputies rejected the 'zero option' compromise - whereby Mr Meshkov would cancel decrees shutting the parliament and deputies would rescind laws restricting the president's authority - offered to them by Mr Meshkov. 'I appeal to deputies to start talks tomorrow,' Mr Meshkov said in a terse address to the parliament. 'I am prepared to meet with you to work out a solution to the constitutional crisis.' Mr Sergei Tsekov, chairman of the parliament, turned down Mr Meshkov's offer and accused the president of seeking a scapegoat for his own failure to deliver the reunion with Russia and economic prosperity he promised Crimeans in presidential elections in January. The political stalemate in Crimea is the most serious political challenge Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma has faced since his election in July and could jeopardise the rapprochement in the often tense relations between Ukraine and Russia. However, Russia, which sees Mr Kuchma as a welcome alternative to more nationalist Ukrainian leaders, has helped the Ukrainian government to contain the Crimean conflict by refusing to intervene. Transferred from Russia to Ukraine only in 1954, the largely Russian inhabitants of Crimea have always been at best lukewarm supporters of Ukrainian independence and both Mr Meshkov and his parliamentary opponents were elected earlier this year on separatist platforms. But the continuing power struggle in Crimea underscores the difficulties, apparent in break-away regions throughout the former Soviet Union, in translating a popular desire for secession into reality. Mr Meshkov, described as a 'bandit' by parliamentarians, is being attacked for the seemingly contradictory offences of appointing too many politicians from Moscow to his government and being too soft in his bid to break-away from Ukraine and join Russia. 'We voted for him with a dream,' Mr Alexander Kurlov, a deputy. 'But all he has done is to put Crimean clocks on Moscow time.'</p>

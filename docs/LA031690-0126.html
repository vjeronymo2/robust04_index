			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> FLORIDA;  </P> <P> ENGINEERS TRY TO PUT SATELLITE IN SAFE ORBIT  </P> <P> Engineers at Kennedy Space Center, Fla., radioed commands to a stranded  $150-million communications satellite to fire on-board rockets in a bid to  boost the errant relay station into a higher, long-term storage orbit.  </P> <P> If all goes well, it will reach a safe orbit sometime today, preventing an  inadvertent re-entry into the atmosphere and providing plenty of time to devise  a rescue plan. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration indicated that  it would consider a rescue by a space shuttle if the satellite reaches a safe  orbit. The Intelsat 6 satellite was stranded in a useless, lopsided orbit when  it failed to separate properly from its Titan 3 booster.  </P></p>

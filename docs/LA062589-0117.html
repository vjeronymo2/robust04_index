			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VIEWPOINTS;  </P> <P> IS BIGGER BETTER IN THE MEDIA BUSINESS?;  </P> <P> SOME EXPERTS QUESTION THE WISDOM OF MEGA-MERGER TREND  </P> <P> Many big U.S. media companies, acting on the assumption that only giant  communications concerns will prosper in coming years amid growing international  competition, have eagerly pursued acquisitions. Time Inc.'s $14-billion offer  for Warner Communications -- an effort being contested by acquisition-minded  Paramount Communications -- is only the latest of the big media merger  proposals. But is bigger really better in the media business? Times researcher  Melanie Pickett asked some experts for their opinions, and excerpts of their  comments follow:  </P> <P> </P> <P> Katharine Graham, chairman and chief executive of the Washington Post Co.,  excerpted from a speech given to the San Francisco Advertising Club:  </P> <P> "I believe the importance of size . . . is over-inflated. . . . Labor-intensive  industries, such as communications, are almost always disadvantaged to some  degree as they get larger. Still, just because being big doesn't necessarily  make sense, it doesn't mean that companies are not going to get even larger.  The competitive urge to grow has never been stronger. The adrenaline is really  pumping. Human nature has taken over: People want to be big because they want  to be big. No evidence has ever surfaced that the dinosaurs, even on the brink  of extinction, wanted to trade places with the cockroaches, who would endure  for a billion years.  </P> <P> "I believe in rigorous management and providing high value to shareholders. But  I don't believe it should be -- or has to be -- at the expense of fulfilling  our greater First Amendment responsibilities. . . . If these global companies  want to take maximum advantage of their distribution channels, they may focus  more on entertainment at the expense of news. News may even become more  entertainment oriented. . . . I'm concerned that, as media companies grow in  size, the desire to make money, achieve power and gratify ego will ultimately  take precedence over the desire to produce a quality product and contribute to  the public good, especially if the owners are professional managers far away. .  . . I'm not against global companies. To some extent we're one, too. But I  don't believe you have to be a global Goliath to survive in this age . . . no  popular magazine, no network television affiliate, no dominant daily newspaper,  nor even a local cable system has failed because it was too small."  </P> <P> Ira Deutchman, a movie producer and director of Independent Features Project  West, an association that promotes the interests of smaller film makers:  </P> <P> "There's a number of different ways of attacking the movie business.  Unfortunately, it has always been an expensive hobby. When the average price of  movies is hitting the $15-million mark, and, in fact, many many movies are a  lot more expensive than that, then being able to be in the position to take  those kinds risks on a day-in, day-out basis puts you in a position where you  can't rise or fall on a single film. That's the reason so many independents are  going under. They've been taking these enormous risks without having the kind  of cash flow to draw upon to be able to absorb losses in those areas.  Therefore, the kind of consolidation that's represented by all the new mergers  and creating all these giant companies is, in point of fact, very good risk  management. To be able to afford to be in this business for the long haul, that  is absolutely necessary.  </P> <P> "Over time, it would seem to me that these large conglomerates are going to  want to increase the number of films they make as well as their shots at  $100-million films. And that's when it's possible that the right kind of  management team at one of these conglomerates could create an atmosphere that  could be incredibly good for independent film makers. . . . Independents have  been good at finding good niche markets and I would assume those will start to  emerge."  </P> <P> Victor Navasky, editor of The Nation magazine:  </P> <P> "The bigger they are, the harder they fall. They're just getting in more and  more trouble, as illustrated by the tragic comedy that's going on right now.  It's a combination of good, old-fashioned American greed and losing sight of  why they went into the media business in the first place. Henry Luce didn't go  into that business to acquire other businesses. He went into it because he  thought he had a way of putting out a magazine that could tell the truth in  short form every week. Of course, it was his version of the truth. The people  who came after lost sight of all that.  </P> <P> "I suspect that's true in every business. In Hollywood, they thought they had a  way of entertaining and making some money for doing that, but the vision of the  founders and the occupation of the successors are very different things.  Deregulation of the Reagan era is what opened the door to all these things. It  would have been inconceivable to have these kinds of merger discussions, given  cable and all the antitrust implications of it, in an era of tough antitrust  enforcement . . . projections (are) that by the end of the century there will  be a half dozen companies that will dominate the international communications,  entertainment, information marketplace globally . . . (That) tends to  homogenize the culture and doesn't leave a sufficient place for people like the  rest of us."  </P> <P> Ben Bagdikian, author of "The Media Monopoly" and professor at the UC Berkeley  Graduate School of Journalism:  </P> <P> "(The result of mergers is) going to be a loss for the public in a number of  ways. The most important loss is a loss of diversity. There's a loss of  diversity of ownership but there's also a loss in diversity in the content --  there will be fewer choices. (Diversity) is important in the entertainment  business because it socializes whole generations on what social values are,  what a desirable personality and social being is. And what it does is narrow  down those choices to those kinds of depictions . . . that make the most money  the fastest for the biggest operators.  </P> <P> "The public loses in another way: To have media power is to have political  power. And one of the things that has happened with the growth of giants in the  media is that their mechanism for creating their dominant empires has been to  use huge amounts of debt. And the tax laws have been written so it rewards that  corporation that has dangerous amounts of debt and shifts the tax burden to  smaller firms and to individuals. Any one of these chief executives or board  chairmen who has one of these dominant media corporations can see the President  of the United States almost any time he or she wants because every political  person has to be concerned with these giant media companies. And they get  respectful attention for the things they want. So our business regulations, our  antitrust laws, our tax laws are very heavily influenced by the desires of  these very large media companies. And that has a hidden, but very strong  effect, on the rest of the public."  </P> <P> John Morton, media analyst with Lynch, Jones &amp; Ryan:  </P> <P> "Globalization is the new buzzword in the financial community. Whether they  have to do that (merge), who knows? But probably there are some advantages for  entertainment companies, companies that depend on programming of one kind or  another, to being bigger. For the kinds of companies I follow, which are  basically newspaper companies, it probably doesn't make much sense. You don't  see any of the big newspaper companies getting excited about globalization and,  in fact, in a couple of instances, have vowed not to. I'm not so sure whether  going after global markets is the major motivation here. The major motivation  is to make money and to accumulate assets."  </P> <P> Dennis McAlpine, an analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co.:  </P> <P> "Hell, no. They've done such a great PR job promoting this American flag  draping. And if you look at it, there really aren't that many synergies between  a Time and a Warner. Somebody had a great field day sitting down and coming up  with all these ideas of what they can do together. Case in point: Time and  Warner say, 'well, we can sell advertising across the media lines.' The problem  is, you have different media buyers. How are you going to do that? That  requires almost a change in the structure of advertising. And I'm not sure  they're going to do that just for Time-Warner or Time-Paramount even. . . .  Whoever comes out winning Time, and I think Time is going to somebody, is going  to have a hell of a lot of debt and a completely different financial structure  than they had going in. That doesn't necessarily mean they're unhealthy, but  they are certainly changed."  </P></p>

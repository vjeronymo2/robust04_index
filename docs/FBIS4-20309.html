			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Li Zexing: "The Basic Features of the New </F> Exchange Rate System--The Third of the Serial Reviews of the  Reform of the Foreign Exchange System"]    [Text] The  unification of renminbi [RMB] exchange rates in 1994 was an  inevitable result of the reform and opening up as well as  development of our country, and also represented the further  deepening of the reform of the foreign exchange management  system and exchange rate system of our country in accordance  with the overall demands of the establishment of the socialist  market economic system, marking the entry of an completely new  RMB exchange rate system into the economic arena of China.    A. The Basic Features of the New RMB Exchange Rate  System    After the unification of exchange rates, the state also  carried out corresponding reforms of the mechanisms of  exchange-rate formation and adjustment, adopting a unitary,  controlled floating rate system based on market supply and  demand. This was an important measure to reform the RMB exchange  rate system, a measure which was based on referring to the  successful experience of Western developed countries, on  international practices, and on a full consideration of the  realities in our country. The new RMB exchange rate system has  the following several features:    1. Exchange rates based on market supply and demand. This  refers to the fact that the supply and demand situation and  exchange rate level on the foreign exchange market constitute  the main factor determining the RMB exchange rate level after  the unification of exchange rates. For instance, the exchange  rate for the RMB against the U.S. dollar published by the  People's Bank of China on 1 January 1994 was the weighted  average price of the U.S. dollar on the major foreign-exchange  swap markets nationwide on 31 December 1993. In the future,  after the unified standardized interbank foreign exchange market  is formed, exchange rates on that market will become the main  basis for the exchange rates published by the People's Bank of  China. In addition, fluctuations in the exchange rates for the  major currencies against the U.S. dollar on the international  foreign exchange market are also an important factor determining  the exchange rates for those currencies against the RMB.    2. Unitary exchange rates. The exchange rates quoted by each  designated foreign exchange bank independently on the basis of  the exchange-rate medium prices published by the People's Bank  of China and the floating range set by regulations will be  applicable to settlements involving foreign exchange and RMB and  foreign exchange-RMB exchanges (encompassing trade foreign  exchange, nontrade foreign exchange, and capital account  activities of earning and spending foreign exchange), and will  also be applicable to domestic and foreign-funded enterprises as  well as Chinese and foreign nationals.    3. Controlled exchange rates. This is mainly manifested in  the macro-regulation and -supervision of RMB exchange rates  exercised by the People's Bank of China through the State  Administration of Exchange Control; that is, when there occur  large exchange-rate fluctuations on the market, the central bank  should intervene in the foreign exchange market through  releasing or retrieving foreign exchange, so as to keep RMB  exchange rates basically stabilized at an appropriate level.    4. Floating exchange rates. This is mainly manifested in two  respects: first, the market exchange rates published by the  People's Bank of China on a daily basis are floating rates;  second, the exchange rates quoted by each designated foreign  exchange bank in its foreign exchange transactions with the  general public may float within the confines of the market rates  published by the People's Bank of China and within the range set  by regulations.    The new RMB exchange rate system is based on the taking of  full account of the existence of the two foreign exchange  markets, the domestic and external markets, and is therefore  full of vitality; it is certain to further stimulate our  country's opening up to the outside world, develop economic and  trade cooperation and contacts between our country and countries  around the world, and be conducive to giving greater play to RMB  exchange rates' role as an economic lever, thereby promoting the  overall reform, opening up, and economic development of our  country, and will also constitute an important step toward RMB  convertibility. The reform of the exchange rate system has been  widely welcomed and highly regarded by people of various circles  at home and abroad. In addition, because the state has adopted  some transitional measures in the transition period, taking full  account of the interests of all sectors of society, the  transition has been smooth up to this moment. It can be said  that the reform of the RMB exchange rate system has been  successful.    B. RMB Exchange Rates Will Be Kept Stabilized at an  Appropriate Level    After the unification of exchange rates, some comrades have  some doubts, believing that the RMB will devalue in a sustained  and significant manner. In my view, such a worry is not well  founded.    First, the economic strength of a country is the basis for  determining the external price (exchange rate) for the national  currency. In 1992-1993 our country had the highest economic  growth rates in the world for two years in a row; the steady  economic growth enabled our country's overall capabilities to  climb another step. The major Western developed countries place  high hopes on the Chinese economy. At the same time our country  has adequate foreign exchange reserves and enjoys a good  balance-of-international-payments situation, while foreign debts  are being kept below the internationally recognized safety  warning line. This is the material foundation for keeping our  country's RMB exchange rates stabilized at an appropriate level.    Second, in accordance with international practices, our  country's central bank will use economic means such as currency  and interest rate policy as well as direct intervention in the  foreign exchange market to regulate the supply and demand for  foreign exchange, so as to maintain relative stability in RMB  exchange rates. This is the practice common to all developed  countries in regard to exchange rate policy. In fact the central  bank's intervention in the foreign exchange swap markets in our  country in the second half of 1993 was very successful, not only  stabilizing market exchange rates but also accumulating rich  experience on intervention in the foreign exchange market.  Maintaining basic stability in currencies' domestic as well as  external prices has always been the main part of the monetary  policy of central banks of various countries. Our country will  not be an exception either during the process of establishing  the socialist market economic system and enhancing macroeconomic  regulation and control. Currently, not only is the RMB very  welcome in neighboring countries, but its exchange rates are  rising. This can also serve as an important basis for judging  the future trend of the RMB in our country.</p>

BRIEFING;  </P> <P> RJR NABISCO INCOME TUMBLES 62%  </P> <P> RJR Nabisco Inc. today reported its first-quarter income tumbled 62% because of  costs associated with its takeover by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts Inc. and the  failure of its smokeless cigarette.  </P> <P> The Atlanta-based consumer products company said its after-tax earnings  amounted to $103 million, down from $273 million a year earlier. Earnings per  share were 44 cents vs. $1.09 in the first quarter of 1988. Sales in this  year's first quarter totaled $4 billion, up 5% from $3.8 billion in 1988.  </P> <P> Also today, company officials refused comment on a Wall Street Journal article  saying RJR Nabisco may soon announce plans to move its corporate headquarters  to New York from Atlanta. RJR Nabisco moved its headquarters to Atlanta two  years ago from Winston-Salem, N.C., its home for more than a century.  </P></p>

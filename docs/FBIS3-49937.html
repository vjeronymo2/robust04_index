In Han i Elezit border crossing between Macedonia  and Kosova, there were crowds of people waiting to go through  the border crossing.    As ATA correspondent in Pristina Belul Jashari reports,  another wave of expulsion of Albanians has burst out in Kosova  recently. To this end several socalled "Tourism agencies" are  involved which carry out the strategy of Serbs' genocide for  ethnic cleansing of Albanians in Kosova. The wave of Albanians'  expulsion was instigated by Serbs' violence and repression to  expel Albanians before January 15 when entry visas will be used  in the Czech Republic, which is the principal station of  Albanian emigrants from Kosova. From there the Kosovar  emigrants move to Western European countries. According to the  data of the Human Rights Defence Council in Pristina, more than  350 thousand Albanians have been expelled from Kosova.</p>

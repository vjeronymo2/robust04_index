			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [NODONG SINMUN 12 January commentator's article: "We Warn </F> Japanese Rightwing Reactionaries"]    [Text] The Japanese right-wing reactionaries'  anti-Republic maneuvers are becoming more grave with each  passing day.    By recently bringing to the front experts in Korean issues  and the press, they are repeatedly waging smear and defamation  against our socialist system, and are speaking ill of us by  talking about our so-called economic difficulties and so forth.    Moreover, they are rashly acting to slander even our system.  They also openly revealed the ambition for military reinvasion  of our country.    The new state advocates [sin kukka chuuija], like Ozawa,  representative of the Japan Renewal Party; and Nakanishi, former  director general of the Japan Defense Agency, branded us as No.1  imaginary enemy by maximizing our nuclear issue and missile  threat. They said that in the event a state of emergency is  created on the Korean peninsula, they will cope with it jointly  with Japan, the United States, and South Korea as one. They even  made absurd and bellicose remarks that a preemptive attack  should be the basis of Japan's national strategy. Some media  also joined this.    As soon as it greeted the new year, the NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN  reported that because our country is a most dangerous and  entirely unpredictable nation, Japan, as its neighbor, should  not forget its existence, and that Japan would participate in  war on the Korean peninsula.    As has been proven, the Japanese right-wing reactionaries  and  some media have lost their discretion and are maliciously  slandering us.    Regarding such an act by the Japanese reactionaries as a  challenge to us, we consider it a grave act.    The anti-Republic smear campaign of the Japanese  reactionaries is a product of the consciousness of crisis of  those who are struck with terror at the might and invincibility  of the anthropocentric socialist system of our country.    In recent years, socialism was frustrated in some countries  and capitalism was restored. Cheering this, the imperialists  are scheming to eliminate socialism from the earth forever and  their spearhead has been directed at our Republic.    Our people, however, are vigorously accelerating socialist  construction by upholding the banner of chuche socialism and by  overcoming repeated difficulties even amid political and  military pressure, threat, and economic blockade of the enemies.    The superiority of ever-victorious socialism in our country  and the might of chuche Korea have been fully demonstrated. This  worked as encouraging might to the world's people who are  fighting for the socialist cause--the cause of independence.    A number of reactionaries, who ran amok to smash our  socialism, crumbled to the ground by themselves.    Nevertheless, the Japanese reactionaries are trying  maliciously to detract from the attraction of our socialism and  isolate and stifle us. This is one of the reasons they are  stubbornly resorting to the hostile, false propaganda aimed at  besmirching the dignity and authority of our Republic, while  distorting facts and reversing black and white.    This proves that the Japanese reactionaries are the most  atrocious enemy of socialism. It is no doubt that if they  continuously resort to anti-Republic and antisocialist  maneuvers, they will be subject to stern denunciation as the  enemy of all of the world's progressive people who are advancing  toward socialism.    If those who are regarded as quick-witted [yaksa pparuda]  people act foolishly ignoring the solemn reality existing in  front of them, they will only be reflected as pitiful existence  to the people.    It is a nasty habit of the Japanese reactionaries to try to  attain their sinister aims by vilifying others. Today prospects  opened for the solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean  peninsula.    As has been reported, holding the third round of talks, our  country and the United States agreed to settle in a package  [ilgwal tagyol] the issues for the essential solution of the  nuclear problem.    Many countries in the world and progressive people welcome  such developments in the situation.    Even political quarters, social circles, and academic  sectors  in Japan raised voices demanding the solution of the nuclear  issue on the Korean peninsula and improvement of DPRK-U.S.  relations.    Nevertheless, only the Japanese right-wing reactionaries and  their followers are opposed to this. The Japanese right-wing  reactionaries are all militarists and revanchists obsessed with  an irresistible zeal for reinvasion. They are stepping up their  moves to turn Japan into a military power and arm it with  nuclear weapons and have justified this by raising the fiction  about our nuclear threat and missile threat.    If the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula is solved and  DPRK-U.S. relations are improved, the Japanese reactionaries  will be unable to use this fiction any more as an excuse.    This is the reason why the Japanese reactionaries are  trying hard to hamper the solution of the nuclear problem on the  Korean peninsula and the improvement of relations between the  DPRK and the United States.    Japan's attempt to be a military power and to arm itself  with  nuclear weapons does not originate from someone's threat but  entirely originates from the Japanese militarists' demand for  realizing the ambition for overseas aggression. The Japanese  reactionaries regard the Korean peninsula as their first target.  This is actually proven by fact -- the Japanese right-wing  reactionaries have not hesitated to say that if an emergency  situation takes place on the Korean peninsula, a preemptive  attack should be basic in the state's strategy and Japan will  participate in the war on the Korean peninsula.    In the past, the Japanese imperialists occupied Korea for  approximately 40 years and imposed innumerable miseries and  sufferings on the Korean people. Our people have not forgotten  the Japanese imperialists' atrocities of sanguinary slaughters  and their cruel activities of exploitation and plunder. Our  people cannot refrain from expressing wrath at the Japanese  imperialists.    If the Japanese reactionaries have a bit of conscience, they  should truly apologize to our people for the great miseries and  sufferings and should compensate for them. Instead of  liquidating the past full of crimes, however, the Japanese  reactionaries are running wild through thick and thin in a bid  to achieve the ambition for the great East Asia coprosperity  sphere by reviving the past.    The Japanese reactionaries' way of thinking and position are  not different from those of the Japanese imperialists at all.  We cannot but point out that the Japanese right-wing  reactionaries' false propaganda against the DPRK is aimed at  making Japan's politics reactionary and fascist and at  obstructing the improvement of DPRK- Japanese relations. On the  pretext of the threat from North Korea, they are trying to  pressure those who call for improvement of DPRK- Japanese  relations.    Today's reality shows that if the Japanese Government  authorities continue to leave alone the right-wing reactionaries  to run wild recklessly, Japan would be made all the more  reactionary and thereby the Japanese people themselves would  suffer therefrom, and then, the neighboring countries would not  be safe either.    The more the Japanese reactionaries adhere to the stratagem  against the DPRK, the more this proves the validity of our  socialist cause. No false propaganda and reckless military  strength obliterate [malsal] the socialism of our own style  centered on the popular masses, which brilliantly gives off its  ray.    The Japanese reactionaries are conducting the activity to  eliminate someone, without considering the single-hearted unity  among the leader [suryong], the party, and the masses and the  might of our socialist self-reliant national economy and the  self- defense in the national defense. This reminds us of the  saying, Fools rush in where angels fear to thread. The Japanese  right-wing reactionaries should give up the foolish thought --  like breaking a rock with head.    Only fools can conduct excessive proud activity. Our people  and People's Army are closely watching with a high degree of  vigilance the Japanese reactionaries' anti-DPRK and  antisocialist maneuvers. Our people will never pardon those who  are trying to impair the national dignity.    We solemnly warn the Japanese reactionaries: If the Japanese  reactionaries constantly persist in the reckless anti-DPRK and  antisocialist maneuvers, they will not get good results. They  must stop acting rashly.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] General Antoine Lahd, commander of the SLA  [South Lebanese Army], says his army has already prepared for  the possibility that in the near future it will remain alone,  that is, that Israel will leave Lebanon in the framework of a  peace arrangement. These remarks were made during an  inauguration ceremony of a hospital built by Israel in the  Shiite village of Bint Jubayl at the cost of $1 million. Our  correspondent Menahem Horowitz reports from the north.    [Begin Horowitz recording] [passage omitted] Gen. Antoine  Lahd, who met Israeli correspondents prior to the ceremony, said  that the SLA has no objections to joining the Lebanese Army in  future.    Over the last year Israel provided $7 million in civilian  aid  to the residents of south Lebanon's security zone. In this  hospital in Bint Jubayl alone Israel invested $1 million.  Israel wants to prove to south Lebanon's population -- mainly  the Shiites -- that despite the political negotiations Israel  will continue to provide them with all possible aid. [end  recording]</p>

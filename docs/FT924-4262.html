			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Accountancy Column: Two sides of a single coin should draw together - Artificial distinctions between accountancy and auditing watchdogs need demolishing A FUNDAMENTAL change in the framework of accounting and auditing in the UK is essential to restore public confidence in the accountancy profession. There has undoubtedly been a crisis of confidence during the past two years. The public and the media frequently equate corporate failure with audit failure, and forget that it is by the very nature of business that some companies succeed and others fail. This is not to say that nothing should be done to improve the scope and quality of audit or corporate reporting. I firmly believe that much can and should be done. But without significant changes which recognise the interdependence of accounting and auditing, it is unlikely that confidence in the accountancy profession will be restored. The issue that needs to be addressed is the largely artificial distinction between the various standard-setting and regulatory activities for accounting and auditing. The position has become increasingly institutionalised and Byzantine. The Financial Reporting Council controls the Accounting Standards Board (ASB), the Financial Reporting Review Panel, and the Urgent Issues Task Force. The Auditing Practices Board (APB) is separately controlled by the Consultative Committee of Accounting Bodies (CCAB), the body jointly owned by the leading professional accountancy bodies. Audit regulation, disciplinary action and ethical guidance come directly from the professional bodies. My firm has long argued for removing regulation from the institutes. The faults with the existing complex system are legion and include the following: Accounting and auditing standard-setters report to separate bodies. The Auditing Practices Board is perceived to be run by accountants for accountants. Even though it has an equal number of practising accountants and lay members, it is funded by and reports to the CCAB. There appear to be divergencies between the priorities of the accounting and auditing standard setters. For example, the ASB appears aloof from the APB's attempts to try to close the expectations gap - between what auditors do and what the public believes they do. The ASB is developing standards without obvious regard for their audit implications. The APB is raising disclosure issues which, under current arrangements, appear more sensibly to lie with ASB. My solution is to end this distinction and put all standard setting and audit regulation under the Financial Reporting Council (FRC). This would inspire more public confidence, since half the members of the top body, the FRC, are lay people who are not accountants. Second, responsibility for both auditing and accounting would force the FRC to treat closing the expectations gap as the top priority for both accounting and auditing standards. Third, it would create an unambiguous link between auditing standards setting and the process of monitoring and policing their application, a link clearly already established between the ASB and the review panel by their parent body. Fourth, it should make things much easier for government, and reduce much of the criticism which ministers are receiving over audit matters. I also believe the new structure would help provide a better platform for the changes that need to be made to improve confidence in corporate governance. The Cadbury Committee on the Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance has identified a host of areas where the proposed changes should impact on both audit and financial reporting practice. Most of these have already been split arbitrarily between the ASB and the APB, even though they have implications for both. As a result, the following problems are already emerging: Going Concern. A draft Auditing Guideline has been issued on assessing the future viability of companies. But it does not canvass the ways in which corporate reporting could be improved to provide users with better information with which to assess this going-concern basis. Also proposals have been made by the APB that the 'subject to' qualified audit reports should disappear and that auditors should assess the adequacy of disclosures of matters affecting a company's ability to continue as a going concern. However, there are no parallel proposals from the ASB as to the extent and nature of disclosure which the corporate sector should make in relation to inherent uncertainties. As a result, a situation could emerge in which there may be no objective criteria against which auditors can make the assessment likely to be required by the APB. Directors' Responsibilities. The Cadbury committee recommended a statement of these responsibilities in the directors' report as a counterpart to a statement by auditors about their reporting responsibilities. Currently, this topic is the subject only of an APB exposure draft and again there could be a lack of suggested guidance for the corporate sector on the form which such a statement should take. Financial Reports. The Cadbury committee also recognised the advantages to users of reports and accounts of some explanation of the factors likely to influence a company's future progress. Useful steps are being taken by the ASB to develop an essentially forward-looking operational and financial review, but much thought needs to be given to developing ideas on the extent to which the auditor should review such information. The ASB by itself does not have the remit to develop such ideas. Consequently their development could end up being rushed at the time of publication of an accounting standard, or it could lag behind. This latter situation arose when the ASB issued Financial Reporting Standard 1 on cash flow statements last year. All of the above are merely symptomatic of the overwhelming need for the co-ordination and monitoring of APB and ASB by a single body. No doubt there is liaison already between the two bodies, but only when they are both under the FRC umbrella will many key problems be addressed properly. Consideration could then be given to the possibility of joint accounting and audit exposure drafts and standards on expectations gap projects, as well as many other topics where there is a need for a concerted effort. Topics which spring to mind include related party transactions and pension schemes. Such documents may individually be longer for all of us to read, but they will ensure that thought is given simultaneously to accounting and audit aspects. That would make it much more likely that the current problems affecting the profession and corporate governance in general will be properly resolved and public confidence restored.

The sources told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that Syrian President  Hafiz al-Asad will visit Tehran this month. Meanwhile, it has  been reported that al-Asad will meet with Egyptian President  Husni Mubarak this month as well. The political circles said  that there is a link between the next Syrian move at this level  and the escalation in Hizballah's activities against Israel via  southern Lebanon.    The sources said that al-Asad will offer new proposals which  could bring views closer between Cairo and Tehran in a renewal  of the Syrian endeavor -- which was suspended before the end of  last year -- to correct positions and ease recent factors of  tension between them.    The sources also said that the Syrian president will submit  to Iranian President Hashemi-Rafsanjani a report on the  development of the Arab-Israeli peace negotiations, the results  of his talks in Geneva last month with U.S. President Bill  Clinton, and the future of peace in the light of the new factors  and changes. The sources said that the Syrian move requires  regional coordination and support in the framework of strategic  interests.</p>

			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / Personal View: Hard on soft commissions Momentum is slowly building on both sides of the Atlantic to restrict the freedom of money managers to accept a novel kind of brokerage rebate called 'soft commissions'. The proposed restrictions are based on the mistaken belief that those who invest in unit trusts, pension funds and other institutional portfolios need even more regulatory protection than they already have. What investors may really need is protection from regulators. The suspicious thing about soft commissions is that they 'bundle' the costs of portfolio research into cash-trading commissions. In a typical soft commission deal, a broker pre-pays research expenses on behalf of a money manager in proportion to the future trading commissions the manager promises the broker. The manager receives research up front and, if all goes as planned, pays for it later by providing the broker with the promised trades. Soft commission business perhaps amounts to Pounds lbn annually in the US and Britain. The widely held view of soft commissions is that they compromise a manager's loyalty to his clients because cash-trading commissions are paid indirectly by clients. Accordingly, soft commissions are said to tempt a manager to engage in excessive trading to generate the commissions necessary to pay the research bill he should properly pay out of his own pocket. They are also said to reduce his willingness to terminate a broker who has failed to execute trades at the best price. An alternative explanation for soft commissions is that they actually benefit investors by subsidising portfolio research, guaranteeing quality of trading execution, and promoting specialisation. To see this, it is first important to separate two issues. First, why are research and execution bundled together at all? Second, why use such a novel arrangement as soft commissions to account for bundled research? Virtually all brokers bundle research and execution. This is true of soft commission brokers, but it is also true of traditional, full-service brokers who produce the research 'in house' and make it available to managers on an informal basis. Most managers are paid just a small fraction of any increase in wealth they generate on their clients' behalf. If they were required to pay the entire research bill out of their own pockets, they would apparently have too little incentive to do well-researched trades. A manager's clients therefore have good reason to subsidise his use of research. Bundling provides the ideal subsidy. In part, profitable trading requires a manager to ensure that the brokers who trade on his clients' behalf execute the trade at the best possible price. But quality of execution is nearly impossible to discern in the short run. How is a manager to prevent an inept, indolent or opportunistic broker doing a shoddy job of execution? Again, bundling does the trick. Having received research up front at the broker's expense, the balance of trading commissions a manager owes the broker serves to bond the broker's performance. Any broker that cheats the manager risks the prospect of being terminated with his account balance unpaid. Far from compromising best execution, bundling actually guarantees it. Why use soft commissions explicitly to account for bundled research? Under the traditional system, the broker's research obligations are only loosely tied to the cash trading commissions he expects from the manager. One consequence is that the broker's research obligations are too indefinite to be transferred; the research must be produced by the broker 'in house'. With soft commissions, the broker's research obligations are explicitly tied to the cash value of the trading commissions he expects. By precisely metering these obligations, soft commissions assure that they are definite enough to be transferred to those who can perform them at least cost. Seen in this light, soft commissions constitute a kind of currency that achieves the benefits of bundling while allowing research and execution to be efficiently produced by specialised firms. Regulators on both sides of the Atlantic are currently entertaining suggestions that soft commissions, but not traditional brokerage, be subject to disclosure requirements. Even when applied uniformly to all commission business, such burdens are probably ill-advised. When applied selectively to soft commissions, they are not just ill-advised but downright disingenuous. The call for regulation should give us pause. It would be comforting to live in a world where money managers' interests were perfectly aligned with those of their clients and where the quality of a broker's execution could be instantly discerned. But that is not the world in which we live, and further regulation to protect investors based on such an ideal world will only make matters worse.

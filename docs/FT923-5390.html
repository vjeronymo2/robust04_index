			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / The FT Interview: Banker from the Old School - Peter Ellwood, chief executive of TSB, speaks to David Barchard At exactly 4pm last Monday Mr Peter Ellwood became the chief executive of TSB, the bank that has recently been saying 'ouch'. He takes over a bank that has been reshaped and remoulded countless times since it came to the stock market in September 1986. From 1989, he presided over TSB's retail banking operations and so has not been implicated in the succession of accidents to befall TSB. These include the purchase of Target in 1987, an insurance company which had to be sold off three years later at an Pounds 80m loss because it duplicated TSB's own successful insurance operations, and Mortgage Express, which had to be closed down because of heavy losses on its mortgage book. Perhaps the most ill-fated deal of all was the acquisition of Hill Samuel, a City merchant bank, for Pounds 777m in 1987. It was made into TSB's corporate lending arm. Last year Hill Samuel was forced to make a bad debt charge of Pounds 436m after many of its loans made between 1988 and 1990 went sour. In doing so, it plunged the entire TSB group into a Pounds 47m loss for 1991. 'Sure the Pounds 777m purchase price of Hill Samuel and the history of Target are well documented. But people who say the story of the TSB is one long succession of disasters should look at the massive strengths of this organisation and not be wholly preoccupied with the problems of the past,' Mr Ellwood says. 'If you look at the total TSB group, the vast majority consists of the retail banking and insurance businesses which are among the most successful operations of their kind in Europe.' After such costly misadventures, he believes that TSB's prospects depend entirely on the success of retail banking core activities. 'Your strategy has got to start by accepting that there are too many players in our market and only a relatively small number of them will survive. The ones that will survive will be those that have a preoccupation with the customer and that means giving value for money,' he says. For Mr Ellwood, creating a lasting bond between customers and their banks is the only way to ensure survival in the 1990s. 'It is still a fact that more people get divorced than change their bank account,' he says. 'We want to keep it that way.' As a result, he puts a premium on pleasing the customer and earning their loyalty. Instead of seeing his new appointment as a poisoned chalice, Mr Ellwood regards it as an opportunity to show that TSB can outshine the pack. 'We could have a strategy that said why don't we milk the customer (with low savings rates) and hope that nobody notices. I think that is outrageous and not sustainable.' So under Mr Ellwood the TSB has embarked on a policy of upgrading its savings products. This policy is the result of the deregulation of Britain's financial markets since the 1980s; a process which increased competition and prompted banks to become more responsive to customer needs. Mr Ellwood, whose career has been the model of an old-fashioned clearing banker, contrasts this with his own early experiences in the industry in the 1960s when customers did not count for much. 'Frankly it was dead easy for banks to make money when I joined my first bank as a cashier in the early 1960s', a time when the industry, with just four clearing banks, was heavily regulated. At the same time, Mr Ellwood recognises that the traditional lending business of the banks is shrinking. Amid the uncertainties of Britain's worst recession in 50 years, with low inflation and high real interest rates, customers are naturally reluctant to borrow. TSB's lending, like that of all the other high street banks, has fallen sharply. In its most recent half-year results the loan book of Pounds 17.6bn was down by 6 per cent on the previous year. 'We became a consumer-hungry society in the UK in the 1980s. People did borrow too much and I accept that they were encouraged to borrow. Now people feel a lot more wary about getting themselves into too much debt and it is not in any bank's interest to see overleveraged customers'. The jovial Mr Ellwood concedes that he is himself a mild casualty of the fallout from the 1980s housing boom. 'I can remember how I felt when buying my house in 1988 and then seeing its price go down.' After the unprecedented peak in houses prices in the late-1980, he believes that house prices have returned to levels more in line with the long-term trend of the past 30-40 years. When Mr Ellwood arrived at TSB in 1989 - after more than 28 years at Barclays where he rose to be chief executive of Barclaycard - the group had six different mortgage lending arms and loans were the name of the game. In today's market, he believes that the battle between banks is for products such as high-quality savings accounts and pensions rather than loans. At the same time, the shakeout in the financial services industry is forcing banks to cut their costs on an unprecedented scale: among the clearing banks, some 20,000 jobs have been shed since 1989, and there's no let-up. 'Income is going to be hard to come by so our cost base has got to come down.' he says. The TSB's response to recession has been two-fold: cutting jobs and improving the quality of services. 'Over the past three years we have reduced the head count by 5,000 to 25,000. I suspect that is bigger in percentage terms than for any other financial institution in this country,' he says. More cuts are likely. The second prong of attack on costs has been its 'quality improvement programme', launched 18 months ago and designed to ensure that branch staff make fewer of the mistakes that irritate customers, such as erroneously processed loan applications. 'The quality process means that branch staff stop doing things twice or three or four times and get things right first time.' he says. In north America, he adds, banking quality improvement programmes have been able to reduce sharply operating costs by ensuring each task - such as sending out correct account details - is not unnecessarily repeated. One snag in Mr Ellwood's strategy of wooing customers with higher interest rate products, is that interest costs to the bank rise. The long-term gains come only over a much longer period from selling a range of financial services. This, he says, explains why profits at TSB's group operations remained flat in the first half of this year, with operating income rising by only 0.3 per cent. At Barclays, by contrast, operating income from UK banking rose by an impressive 22 per cent even though much of it was wiped out by bad debt. The good news though for TSB is that the number of its customers, Mr Ellwood says, is growing faster than at any time since the 1986 flotation. He cites such factors to support his view that TSB group can hold its own against its rivals even though with total assets of Pounds 25.6bn it is only half the size of Lloyds and less than a quarter of Barclays or National Westminster. Sceptics believe that the relatively small high street banks are going to find the struggle increasingly difficult because they do not enjoy the economies of scale of the industry's giants. But Mr Ellwood insists, not entirely convincingly, that the contest is not as unequal as it looks. 'There is no really strong evidence, for example, looking at technology costs that the top two banks can really provide money transmission services more cheaply than we do,' he says. Nor is he very concerned that the arrival of the single market next year means that TSB needs a foothold in other EC countries. 'Mass retail banking in Europe is nowhere near the top of my agenda,' he says, an acknowledgement perhaps that TSB group is in no position to make such a move. Instead, the danger may be that the recession will leave British banks, including TSB, weak and vulnerable to foreign takeovers. 'I think the vast majority of plcs in the UK feel vulnerable. Sure there are risks . . . The answer is to run your own business damned well.' PERSONAL FILE 1944 Born in Manchester.

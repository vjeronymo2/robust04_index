			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON;  </P> <P> CITY OKS EXPANSION OF MEDICAL BUILDING  </P> <P> The City Council approved plans this week to allow an expanded medical office  building across the street from St. Jude Hospital &amp; Rehabilitation Center.  </P> <P> Several doctors spoke in favor of allowing a developer to replace the current  31,500-square-foot office building with a three-story building more than twice  its size on the southeast corner of Harbor Boulevard and Valencia Mesa Drive in  Fullerton.  </P> <P> Doctors said they have outgrown the current building and need more office space  near the hospital.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Molly McClanahan voted against the project, saying she did not  like the idea of such a large building on that corner. She asked council  members to scale down the proposed 72,000-square-foot building to 60,000 square  feet, but was outvoted 4 to 1.  </P> <P> Besides the larger building, the project also includes a four-level parking  structure with 355 spaces.  </P> <P> Initially, the developer and co-owner of the building, McBride Development Co.  of Brea, had asked the city to allow a 109,000-square-foot building on the  corner. But the Planning Commission and council rejected those plans last year  and asked the company to come back with plans for a smaller building.  </P> <P> As part of Tuesday's approval, McBride Development must pay for improvements at  the nearby intersection of Harbor and Bastanchury Road to ease the impact of  more cars traveling to the building.  </P> <P> Construction for the expanded office building probably will begin this fall,  said James G. McGrade, vice president of the developer. TOM McQUEENEY  </P></p>

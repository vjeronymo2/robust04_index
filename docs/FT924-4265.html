			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Technology: Streets full of chaos More in-car information may cut stress by enabling drivers to avoid crowded routes and car parks, but it could also boost chaos on the roads. Worried that motorists could be swamped by data on anything from traffic snarls to local places of interest, the UK's Department of Transport has commissioned a code of practice on car telephones, in-vehicle computers and sophisticated route guidance systems. With so much data, drivers could face a battery of dials and displays similar to a small aircraft cockpit. But unlike a pilot, they will have only a split second to scan the screens and take in the data. The DoT agrees that additional real-time information will benefit motorists on increasingly busy roads, but it does not want them crashing into each other as they follow detailed electronic maps. Jane Robertson, senior project officer at ICE Ergonomics, Loughborough University, which is doing the DoT research, says the code, available in draft form early in the New Year, will look particularly at the new hardware likely to distract a driver from more than the briefest glance. The team will assess such factors as the size of display screens, the number of words in a display, the duration of messages and the presentation of graphics. It will also look at the positioning of the hardware in terms of field of vision, as well as whether drivers need to stretch from their seat to reach the controls or see the displays. Additionally, Robertson says the type of materials and the use of different types of controls also need be addressed. Without proper guidelines, she says manufacturers could produce hardware with rough edges or inappropriate materials, resulting in drivers receiving severe body damage if an accident occurs. Peter Williams of the DoT's driver information unit says the code will be voluntary but expects all manufacturers will be keen to follow it for their own marketing. He claims the DoT is the first national transport department in Europe to conduct such research, although the the idea has been welcomed by other transport offices.</p>

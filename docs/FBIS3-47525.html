			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A colleague of the slain former rebel leader  Vicente Martinez yesterday accused exiled communist Jose Maria  Sison and the military of "muddling" the circumstances  surrounding the killing.    A statement from the Alex Boncayao Brigade sent to the  INQUIRER office yesterday, meanwhile, pointed to the military as  the "direct perpetrator" of the killing, but also held the Sison  led faction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP)  responsible for "opening the door for (the military's) bloody  intrigue."    Ricardo Reyes, former secretary general of the CPP, added  that Sison and Armed Forces Chief of Staff Lisandro Abadia are  using the victim for "self serving purposes."    Sison's group was earlier implicated by Martinez's comrades  in the underground movement in Visayas in the killing, but Sison  reversed the accusations, saying that Martinez must have been  killed by the communist opposition in connivance with the  military and the police.    "Martinez was known to have distanced himself from the  (opposition group)," Sison said, adding that "he (Martinez) was  subsequently suspected by the (opposition) of turning against  it."    But Reyes, who has now joined the open legal struggle  refuted  Sison's statements.    "Vic Martinez has unequivocally and steadfastly stood for  the  opposition," he said. "I know it because we are co-workers in  the (Philippine Ecumenical Action for Community Empowerment  Foundation)," he added.    "Sobrang kawalanghiyaan na ito [This is notoriously  shameless]," Reyes said, describing alleged "twisting of facts."    In criticizing the military, Reyes said that Abadia has  exonerated the military "with indecent haste... relying on  something as dubious as intelligence reports." Because of this,  he said the military's impartiality has therefore been  compromised in the investigation.    Sergio Romero, ABB [Alex Boncayao Brigade] commanding  officer, said that the "bloody intrigues" were sparked by  Sison's group when it issued last month "charge sheets" against  four ranking leaders in the CPP opposition who are to be tried  in "people's courts."    These are Reyes, former NPA [New People's Army] chief Romulo  Kintanar, Metro Manila CPP head Felimon Lagman and CPP Visayas  chair Arturo Tabara.    The ABB called on Sison's group to "repair the damage they  have done." Likewise, he demanded the withdrawal of the charges  against the opposition leaders and to stop Sison's personal  attacks against these people.    Meanwhile, Luis Jalandoni, vice chairman of the National  Democratic Front (NDF), yesterday condemned the killing of  Martinez and warned that such "bloody intrigues" would frustrate  the peace talks.    "Any attempt of the Ramos regime to carry out bloody  intrigue  against the revolutionary movement will render impossible  further talks between the NDF and the (government)," Jalandoni,  who represents the NDF in the peace talks, said in a statement  from Utrecht, The Netherlands.</p>

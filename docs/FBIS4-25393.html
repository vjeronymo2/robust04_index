			<p>BFN     [Text] Istanbul, June 9 (XINHUA) -- Foreign ministers from  16 NATO countries hope to establish a "dialogue and  cooperationship" with Russia, a high-ranking NATO official said  here today.    Speaking at a press conference following an one-day NATO  foreign ministers meeting, Sergio Balanzino, deputy NATO  secretary-general, said that Russia has a special position in  Europe and a good cooperationship between NATO and Russia is  very vital to the stability and security of Europe.    Balanzino said that the alliance welcomes Russia to sign the  Partnership for Peace, but he reaffirmed that NATO will not give  "the special position" to Russia.    He said that the program of the Partnership for Peace will  come true, and it is a very satisfying matter for the stability  and security of Europe.    The Partnership for Peace program provides for broad  political and military cooperation, including joint maneuvers  and NATO help in defense planning and in converting arms  industries to civilian purposes. It stops short of providing  any security guarantees, but will allow for eventual NATO  membership for some East European nations.    If Russia signs a basic partnership agreement, NATO would be  ready to broaden cooperation into such areas as nuclear arms and  safety and European security issues.    The joining of the Partnership for Peace by he former East  Block countries will strengthen not only the political  relationship but also the military cooperation between the two  sides, said the official.    In a joint communique released at the end of the NATO  meeting, the ministers agreed to develop "constructive  relations" with Russia, which they believe can make important  contribution to European stability and security.    "We wish to develop constructive relations of mutual  respect,  benefit and friendship between Russia and the alliance," said  the communique.    During the meeting, a number of other regional issues,  including tensions in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in southern  Caucasus and NATO's relations with other international  institutions, were also discussed.    Foreign ministers from 41 member states of the North  Atlantic  Cooperation Council will meet here Friday [10 June] to discuss  the partnership between NATO member states and newly jointed  countries.</p>

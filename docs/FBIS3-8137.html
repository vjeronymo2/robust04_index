Meciar was justifying his  decision not to sign the law on large privatization, which will  be returned to parliament.    He said the law on large privatization had to ensure the  connection between the FNM and the government, although it was  not necessary that the finance minister be also chairman of the  Inspection Body of the FNM. It was in the interest of  parliament that a member of the government, possibly a state  secretary, should be a member of the FNM board, Meciar said.    As well as being premier, Meciar is at present privatization  minister and chairman of the FNM board. However, the amendment  to the law on privatization forbids this.    If the government is not connected to the FNM, which will  also be the holder of the disposable resources, the cabinet will  not be capable of giving companies further guarantees for loans  and credits abroad, because it will not be able to cover  possible losses, Meciar warned.    "If we knew what sort of situation we might get into we  would  propose a state budget without a deficit. The deficit we would  shift on to the FNM, as Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus has done,"  Meciar said.</p>

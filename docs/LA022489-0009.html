			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEFEND FICTION, AND YOU DEFEND TRUTH;  </P> <P> READ WRITERS LIKE RUSHDIE AND SEE HUMANITY IN PROGRESS  </P> <P> Mikhail Bakhtin was perhaps the greatest theorist of the novel in our century.  His life, in a way, is as exemplary as his writings. Shunted off to remote  areas of the Soviet Union by the minions of Stalinism for his unorthodox ideas,  Bakhtin could not profit from rehabilitation when it came under Brezhnev,  simply because he had never been accused of anything. A victim of faceless  intolerance, his political nemesis was Stalin, but his literary symbol was  Kafka.  </P> <P> His case was and is not unique. I have thought a lot about Bakhtin while  thinking about Salman Rushdie during these past few weeks. Rushdie's work  perfectly fits the Bakhtinian contention that ours is an age of competitive  languages. The novel is the privileged arena where language in conflict can  meet, bringing together, in tension and dialogue, not only opposing characters,  but also different historical ages, social levels, civilizations and other,  dawning realities of human life. In the novel, realities that are normally  separated can meet, establishing an encounter of dialogue, a meeting with the  other.  </P> <P> This is no gratuitous exercise. It reveals a number of things. The first is  that, in dialogue, no one is absolutely right; neither speaker holds an  absolute truth or has an absolute hold over history. Myself and the other, as  well as the history that both of us are making, still are not. Both are  unfinished and so can only continue to be. By its very nature, the novel  indicates that we are becoming. There is no final solution. There is no last  word.  </P> <P> This is what Milan Kundera means when he proposes that the novel is a constant  redefinition of men and women as problems, never as sealed, concluded truths.  But this is precisely what the ayatollahs of this world cannot suffer. For the  ayatollahs, reality is dogmatically defined, once and for all, in a sacred  text. But a sacred text is, by definition, a completed and exclusive text. You  can add nothing to it. It does not converse with anyone. It is its own  loudspeaker. It offers perfect refuge for the insecure, who then, having the  protection of a dogmatic text over their heads, proceed to excommunicate those  whose security lies in search for the truth. I remember Luis Bunuel often  saying: "I would give my life for a man who is looking for the truth. But I  would gladly kill a man who thinks that he has found the truth."  </P> <P> This Bunuelian, surrealist sally is now being dramatically acted out in  reverse. An author who is looking for the truth has been condemned to death by  a priestly hierarchy whose deep insecurity is disguised by its pretension to  holding the truth.  </P> <P> The ayatollahs, nevertheless, have done a great service to literature, if not  to Islam. They have debased and caricatured their own faith. But they have  shifted the wandering attention of the world to the power of words, literature  and the imagination, in ways totally unforeseen in their philosophy.  </P> <P> For the intolerance of the ayatollahs not only sheds light on Salman Rushdie  and his uses of the literary imagination. By making this imagination so  dangerous that it deserves capital punishment, the sectarians have made people  everywhere wonder what it is that literature can say that can be so powerful  and, indeed, so dangerous.  </P> <P> In a deservedly famous commentary, Philip Roth once distinguished between  reactions to literature East and West. In totalitarian regimes, Roth said,  everything matters and nothing goes. In the liberal democracies, nothing  matters and everything goes. Suddenly, "The Satanic Verses" has pushed the  "nothing goes" of intolerance right out into the public squares of democratic  indifference. Suddenly, we all realize that everything matters, whether it goes  or not. I do not believe that there is a single intelligent writer in Europe,  or both Americas, or Africa, Asia or Down Under, who does not feel threatened  by the possibilities so melodramatically opened by the ayatollahs' crusade  against the freedom of the imagination. It can't happen here? You can bet your  bottom dollar, peso, franc or pound that it can.  </P> <P> Saying the same thing as Roth, Italo Calvino once wrote that when politics pays  too much attention to literature, this is a bad sign, mostly for literature.  But, he added, it is also a bad sign when politics doesn't want to hear the  word literature mentioned. It means that the society has become afraid of any  use of language that calls into question the certitudes it holds about itself.  </P> <P> I have always conceived the novel (at least those I try to write) as a  crossroads between the individual and the collective destinies of men and  women. Both tentative, both unfinished, but both only sayable and minimally  understandable if it is previously said and understood that, in fiction, truth  is the search for truth, nothing is pre-established and knowledge is only what  both of us -- reader and writer -- can imagine.  </P> <P> There is no other way to freely and fruitfully explore the possibilities of our  unfinished humanity. No other way to refuse the death of the past, making it  present through memory. No other way of effectively giving life to the future,  through the manifestation of our desire now.  </P> <P> That these essential activities of the human spirit should be denied in the  name of a blind yet omniscient, paralytical yet actively homicidal dogmatism is  both a farce and a crime in itself. Salman Rushdie has done the true religious  spirit a service by brilliantly imagining the tensions and complements that it  establishes with the secular spirit. Humor, certainly, cannot be absent, since  there is no contemporary language that can utter itself without a sense of the  diversification of that same language. When we all understood everything, the  epic was possible. But not fiction. The novel is born from the very fact that  we do not understand one another any longer, because unitary, orthodox language  has broken down. Quixote and Sancho, the Shandy brothers, Mr. and Mrs. Karenin:  their novels are the comedy (or the drama) of their misunderstandings. Impose a  unitary language and you kill the novel, but you also kill the society.  </P> <P> I hope that everyone, after what has happened to Salman Rushdie and "The  Satanic Verses," now understands this. Fiction is not a joke. It is but an  expression of the cultural, personal and spiritual diversity of mankind. It  cannot express that diversity if it only expresses one truth. It is a harbinger  of a multipolar and multi-cultural world, where no single philosophy, no single  belief, no single solution, can shunt aside the extreme wealth of mankind's  cultural heritage. Our future depends on the enlarged freedom for the  multiracial and the polycultural to express itself in a world of shifting,  decaying and emerging power centers.  </P> <P> Salman Rushdie has given form to a dilemma previously embodied, at diverse  levels, in the West, by the novels of Bernanos, Mauriac and Camus, as well as  by the films of Bergman, Fellini and Bunuel. And that is: Can we revolt back  into the sacred? Can the religious mentality thrive outside religious dogma and  hierarchy? These are questions essential to any idea of freedom. But the  burdens of freedom, as Dostoevsky's Grand Inquisitor well knew, can be heavier  than the chains of slavery. Long live my chains! exclaimed the Spanish patriots  painted by Goya as their revolutionary liberators, the Napoleonic troops, mowed  them down. And, in another direction, Georg Buchner proclaimed, in "Danton's  Death," that since God no longer existed, mankind was now responsible for its  own destiny and could not shift the blame anymore.  </P> <P> The modern age, by liberating both the freedom for good and the freedom for  evil, has placed upon us all the obligation to relativize both. Absolute good  is called Pollyanna. Absolute evil is called Hitler. Relative good is called  Simone Weil. Relative evil is called Sade. But the name of relativity is no  longer virtue; it is value. Bad literature stays at the level of virtue: It  pits good guys against bad guys. Good literature rises to the level of values  in conflict with one another. This is what Salman Rushdie has done in all of  his novels.  </P> <P> That Rushdie has dramatized the conflict within Islam does not, however, exempt  those of us, within the Judeo-Christian tradition from looking at our own  sources of intolerance or at our own limits when our own symbols are set into  conflicting motion. Artists have been silenced or "disappeared" in Latin  America for not spouting the official truth of our local, mostly military,  ayatollahs. Jean Luc Godard in Europe and Martin Scorsese in the United States  have been attacked for seriously exploring in the Catholic faith what Rushdie  is exploring in the Islamic faith -- that is, the combinations, the  possibilities, the ghosts beyond the dogmas. A number of Jewish writers and  comedians have poked fun at Judaism. What are the limits? What if a Jewish  writer imagined Anne Frank as a young whore? What if a Catholic writer depicted  Joseph as a jealous husband and the true betrayer of Christ?  </P> <P> The alarming thing about Salman Rushdie's experience in intolerance is that it  has revealed a seething alliance of commercial cowardice and fundamentalist  intolerance surrounding the self-proclaimed island of rationality in any given  society. Sects coexist with commercialism in Georgia and Guatemala. Let these  two factors -- booksellers and publishers succumbing to terrorist threats, and  zealots of all faiths discovering their sectarian brotherhood, be it Muslim,  Christian or Jewish -- prevail, and the margins of freedom in our world will  quickly and frighteningly shrink.  </P> <P> The defense of Salman Rushdie is a defense of ourselves. It is a matter of  pride to say that Rushdie has given us all a better reason to understand and  protect the profession of letters at the highest level of creativity,  imagination, intelligence and social responsibility.  </P></p>

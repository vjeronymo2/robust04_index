			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUNG-BASHING  </P> <P> Russell Jacoby's review of my book, "Power and Politics: The Psychology of  Soviet-American Partnership" (Book Review, July 2) begins with the following:  ". . . Jung was -- to put the best face on it -- confused by the politics of  his day. In Nazism he glimpsed an ecstatic Wotan; he babbled about the creative  Aryan unconscious and the inferior Jewish psyche." Jacoby then proceeds to  belittle ("Americans spout facts; Russians brood. See the problem?"),  ridicule/belittle (". . . (Bernstein) proposes some practical solutions which  are . . . inane,") and misread/misquote my work (e.g. attributing the concept  of "pseudospeciation" to Jung, whereas I quoted the work of Lorenz and Erikson,  neither of them Jungians).  </P> <P> Jacoby's antipathy toward Carl Jung pervades his entire "review" of my book.  His antipathy is so intense that he totally dismisses and disparages, virtually  without analysis, all of Jung's theories. Surely such an international figure  and scholarly psychiatrist who wrote more than 20 volumes in his lifetime must  have said something of value -- alleged Nazi sympathies notwithstanding.  </P> <P> I do not fault Jacoby's hostility over Jung's anti-Semitism and his alleged  Nazi sympathies. The former seems clear; the latter appears to be questionable.  As a Jew I have some feeling about this aspect of Jung myself -- to the point  where I chaired a workshop on Jung and anti-Semitism at the Jung Foundation's  International Congress in Paris last month. However, I do fault Jacoby and The  Times for lack of objectivity, poor editorial management, and questionable  editorial ethics. It seems to me that Jacoby's objectivity, necessary to do a  professionally competent review (of any book) was lacking. If he needed to  attack Jung and his theories, he should have done so by reviewing one of Jung's  works, not by using my book as a club for Jung-bashing.  </P> <P> JEROME S.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An applicant for a continuation or on-going support grant must submit a letter notifying the Institute of its intent to seek such funding, no later than 120 days before the end of the current grant period. The Institute will then notify the applicant of the deadline for its renewal grant application. See section IX.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Special Interest Categories  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Guideline contains 12 Special Interest categories, i.e., those project areas that the Board has identified as being of particular importance to the State courts. Four new categories have been added this year: ``Children and Families in Court'' (section II.B.2.e.); ``Resolution of Current Evidentiary Issues'' (section II.B.2.g.); ``Eliminating Race and Ethnic Bias in the Courts'' (section II.B.2.i.); and ``Improving the Courts' Response to Gender-Related Crimes of Violence'' (section II.B.2.k.).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Five of FY 1994's Special Interest categories have been eliminated: ``Court Financing;'' ``Delay Reduction'' (although section II.B.2.b.iv. of the 1995 Guideline solicits applications for a National Symposium on Reducing Litigation Delay) (see also section II.B.2.d.); ``Intermediate Sanctions;'' ``Improving the Use of Juries'' (jury issues are now addressed in the ``Enhancing Court-Community Relations'' Special Interest category (section II.B.2.a.); and ``Family Violence and the Courts'' (although the issues addressed by that category are now addressed by new Special Interest categories e. and k. noted above).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Guideline also solicits proposals to conduct two major national conferences: the National Symposium on Reducing Litigation Delay noted above and a National Symposium on Sentencing Issues. See section II.B.2.b.iv.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Consultant Rates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Institute is strongly committed to assuring that the compensation paid to consultants working under SJI grants is reasonable in terms of both the total amount paid to an individual consultant, and the amount paid for individual tasks. A recent internal review of consultant rates found that the number of consultants charging in excess of $300 a day has risen significantly in recent years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board of Directors is concerned about both the level of compensation paid consultants, and the increase in the number of consultants receiving compensation under SJI-supported projects. Although no changes in the Grant Guideline are required, the Institute will be undertaking changes in procedure (including Board participation in the review process and more detailed reports from applicants and grantees) to assure that the compensation paid consultants is commensurate with the nature and quality of the services to be performed; reasonable, in terms of the tasks performed and in total; and consistent with the public service mission of the Institute.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

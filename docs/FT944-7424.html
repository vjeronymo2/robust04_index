			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / International Bonds: Issuers choose defensive instruments Issuers on the eurobond market turned yesterday to defensive instruments in the face of volatility in government bond markets. Issuance was mainly in dollars and investors showed demand for floating-rate notes and short-dated paper. 'The rally in US Treasury prices is likely to bring sellers to the market and put upward pressure on secondary market spreads,' said one trader. Another dealer said: 'Spreads on lower-quality debt have already begun to widen and this could have a knock-on effect with investors switching out of eurobonds and into Treasuries in a flight to quality.' Monte dei Paschi di Siena, Italy's fifth-largest bank, launched a Dollars 200m offering of five-year floating-rate notes with a coupon of 18.75 basis points over three-month Libor. Demand for the notes came from investors in Hong Kong and France, and from Japanese investment funds in London and Asia. Citicorp launched a DM250m issue of five-year FRNs offering a coupon of 25 basis points over three-month Libor. At the short end of the dollar sector, General Electric Capital Corporation launched a Dollars 200m offering of two-year bonds priced to yield six basis points over US government bonds and offering a coupon of 7 3/8 per cent. Lead manager Goldman Sachs said the deal was targeted mainly at retail investors and that most of the bonds were sold across Europe but with limited interest from domestic German investors. In another deal targeted at retail investors, ABB International Finance launched a Dollars 200m offering of bonds due January 1997, priced to yield 20 basis points over US government bonds and offering a coupon of 7.5 per cent. 'The two-year area of the dollar sector is where European investors want to be,' said one trader.</p>

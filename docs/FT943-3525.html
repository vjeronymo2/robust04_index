			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Drug company representatives arrested in hospital investigation Italian police have arrested over a dozen drug company representatives and health officials, Reuter reports from Palermo. They are suspected of systematically overcharging hospitals of some L1000bn (Pounds 412m) over the past 10 years. Magistrates have warned another 120 people they face investigation in the affair. The arrested officials included representatives of Germany's Bayer and Boehring Mannheim and the US company Beckman Instruments, along with Italian company Dasit. The drug company officials are alleged to have leased equipment used for blood testing and analysis to health departments almost free of charge in return for being paid up to four times the going price for accompanying chemicals and drugs. Palermo magistrates have sent out documents on the case to other Italian cities so that colleagues can investigate whether there have been similar incidents elsewhere.</p>

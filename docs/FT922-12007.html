			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Television campaign by ITV watchdog DURING AN advertising break last night on ITV the Independent Television Commission launched a promotion of itself. The first of a series of three advertisements was on the issue of impartiality. It not only turned an argument on nuclear power on its head but turned a head on its head - with its image of a face that could be viewed from top or bottom. The copyline ran: 'We're here to ITC you get both sides of the story,' in a reference to the commission's regulatory role in ensuring that impartiality rules are obeyed throughout commercial television. Another 30-second advertisement will show a child grimacing in response to a violent scene on television. It aims to explain the commission's role in monitoring the 9pm watershed, after which programmes with more adult content can be shown. The advertisement, depicting a shooting, is itself so violent that it can be shown only after 9pm. The third strand of the campaign will show how the commission ensures that the rules on honest advertising are adhered to - 'We're here to ITC you aren't misled.' The campaign, devised by Duckworth, Finn, Grubb, Waters, the advertising agency, would cost Pounds 500,000 at normal airtime rates. However, the commission has the right to free promotional airtime. It decided to go ahead with the campaign after discovering that in spite of the publicity during last year's tenders for ITV franchises, barely 10 per cent of the public knew anything about the regulatory body.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Lagos, 14 Apr (PANA) -- France denied Thursday [14  April] in Lagos that the recent joint military exercise it held  with Benin, Nigeria's western neighbour, was aimed at  intimidating Nigeria in the event of an out-break of hostilities  with Cameroon over the disputed Bakassi Peninsula.    French defence attache in Nigeria, Col. John Eglinger, said  that the exercise was planned "about a year ago," long before  the current disagreement between Nigeria and Cameroon. Col.  Eglinger said that Nigeria had been duly informed about the  plans for holding the joint exercise. Concerning France's  position in the Bakassi dispute between Nigeria and its former  colony of Cameroon, englinger said that France was committed to  ""an amicable resolution"" of the conflict. He reiterated  France's preparedness to assist mediate in the dispute which, he  said, France believed could be resolved through "bilateral  discussion."    France held its military exercise with Benin in March, an  operation interpreted by military sources in the Nigerian  capital as an effort to intimidate the Nigerian Army should the  dispute over the oil-rich Bakassi Peninsula escalate into a  military confrontation between Nigeria and Cameroon. France had  allegedly used an unusually "large" arsenal including war planes  and war ships in the exercise which lasted for several days.</p>

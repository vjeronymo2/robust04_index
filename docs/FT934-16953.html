			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Arguments over taxation rage among rivals THE ARGUMENT over tax and spending reached a new pitch yesterday as the leading Tory protagonists fired their final salvoes before this week's party conference in Blackpool. With the government's plans to extend value added tax to domestic fuel expected to be attacked by some grassroots representatives, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, said his predecessor Mr Norman Lamont had been quite right to include the measure in his last Budget package. Mr Clarke, writing in the Conservative party newspaper Newsline, said the 'British habit' of zero-rating many goods had created anomalies in what was 'otherwise a fair tax'. But he did not rule out changing Mr Lamont's proposals by levying VAT at a lower rate than 17.5 per cent. The chancellor - who will address conference under the watchful gaze of Baroness Thatcher, the former prime minister, on Thursday - urged the government's critics to hold their fire until the package of measures to help the less well-off pay their fuel bills was unveiled. But he sought to lower expectations of what this package would include, saying that increased benefit payments 'already exceed the extra costs on VAT on fuel' for some households. 'There is no reason at all why the better off should not pay VAT on their central heating,' he said. Among the government's right-wing critics, the Thatcherite Conservative Way Forward yesterday advised Mr John Major, the prime minister, that a pledge not to increase income tax in next month's Budget would 'work wonders for party morale'. Mr Lamont was also on the attack, saying it would be 'wrong if all the contribution to deficit reduction came from increased taxes'. 'We were not re-elected to raise taxes and action must be taken on spending,' he told CWF's quarterly magazine. Contradicting a number of cabinet ministers who have argued that next year's public expenditure could not be reduced below existing pre-set levels, he said there was 'nothing sacrosanct' about the 'tight' spending targets agreed under his chancellorship. 'Action in the first instance ought to be on the spending side,' he said. Mr Michael Portillo, the Thatcherite Treasury chief secretary, spoke of the need to 'minimise the size of the state', in an article for CWF focusing on the longer term. 'The government spends too much of the citizens' money,' he argued. 'Too large a proportion of government spending will lead to an oppressive level of taxation . . . Borrowing merely shifts the burden to a future generation,' he said. Lord Tebbit, the former Tory chairman, said tax increases were inevitable because of the need to get the deficit down and the government's determination not to cut public expenditure below pre-set levels.</p>

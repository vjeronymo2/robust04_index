			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Finland sells SBF to banks for FM5.6bn THE BIGGEST restructuring of the Finnish banking sector was unveiled yesterday when the government sold off the Savings Bank of Finland (SBF) to four of the country's leading banks for FM5.6bn (Dollars 983m). Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, Unitas, Okobank and Postipankki will each pay FM1.4bn for a share of SBF's 650 branches and FM48bn of deposits. SBF collapsed into the arms of the state last year. As the second biggest casualty of the country's financial crisis, after Skopbank, it has received FM14.6bn in state support. Yesterday's deal will leave the state shouldering FM32.6bn of SBF's non-performing assets, including real estate with a book value of FM6.2bn. This will be administered by an asset management company, backed by FM5bn of equity. The state will be paid through a combination of cash, bank shares, other stocks and preferred capital. Both KOP and Unitas, the country's biggest commercial banks, are planning to issue new shares to the government guarantee fund in part-payment. This will leave the state with a stake of about 10 per cent in KOP, which is taking over 135 SBF branches, and a 6 per cent stake in Unitas, which is acquiring 122 branches. The government guarantee fund said the agreed dismemberment of SBF was the best way to promote competition and rationalisation in the Finnish bank sector. The deal will lead to a significant number of branch closures. The government was under pressure to find a quick solution to SBF's problems as its customer base disintegrated under the marketing onslaught of competitors. It leaves Skopbank, a commercial bank which has come under state control, in limbo. Its role as the central bank of the SBF will disappear, although it will still derive business from 40 independent savings banks outside the SBF network.</p>

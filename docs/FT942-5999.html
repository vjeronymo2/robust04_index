			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Back on track in Romania In the 1980s, Astra, Romania's leading railway rolling stock manufacturer, helped the country fill its export quotas to the Soviet Union by designing special freight wagons strong enough to withstand Siberia's sub-zero temperatures. Then came the collapse of communism and Comecon, the former East Bloc trading organisation, and Astra discovered that its expertise in building made-for-Siberia rolling stock was no longer of any value. To survive, Astra, like most factories in eastern Europe, had to make a radical turn to the west. As it turned out, Astra - still owned by the state and run by its old managers - is one of the rare Romanian heavy industrial companies that is successfully making this switch. Before 1989, about 90 per cent of Astra's exports went to Comecon countries. Now, around 90 per cent of its exports go to western markets. And the company will export more than 70 per cent of the 450 wagons it expects to produce this year. Under licence from French company De Dietrich, Astra, based in Arad, on the border with Hungary, 300 miles east of Bucharest, will begin production this year of Corail cars - top of the range passenger coaches capable of travelling at 125mph an hour - which it plans to export to western Europe, once it has built 200 for the Romanian railway company. 'It all started in 1990 when we were allowed to make contracts on our own and not through the ministry of trade or foreign trade companies as before,' says Mr Sandu Albulescu, trade manager. 'Until then, we were obliged to give priority to Comecon countries. Now, we make deals on a commercial basis. We had to find new markets in the west due to the severe recession in this region.' Unlike their comrades in the former Soviet Union, Astra's managers do not long for the 'good old days' of central planning, but they say their new freedom has its costs. 'We prefer the current conditions - we have got rid of a lot of the bureaucracy - the party, the ministries, the trade unions,' says Mr Georghe Toduta, deputy manager. During President Nicolae Ceausescu's iron reign, managers had to report production levels daily to Bucharest and, as Mr Toduta says, 'the stress was much greater then'. The challenge for post-communist managers now, Mr Toduta says, is that while 'the degree of freedom is much greater, so is the responsibility. If we work badly and make bad decisions, the factory will close down.' Astra already has contracts with German, Swiss, Austrian and Kazakh railways for 1,000 light oil transport wagons, a new model which it developed after 1989. To keep up with demand, Mr Albulescu says the company needs to set up a new production line for the wagon and for a similar model for heavier oil products. Western contracts mean that Astra, which first started manufacturing rolling stock in 1891, has had to upgrade its production to meet the high technical, quality and environmental standards required by its new customers. Under the deal with De Dietrich, the French company has begun to transfer technology to Astra in Arad where the company can draw on a pool of some 300 engineers and designers at the local rail engineering institute. De Dietrich is supplying Astra with a new production line, machine tools and components for the first 50 Corail coaches. It is also training Astra staff at its headquarters near Strasbourg. Mr Albulescu says the company's competitive edge comes from the labour force: 'Wages for skilled workers are a fraction of those in France. The average wage in this country is less than Dollars 100 a month.' He says the company has also become much tougher on its domestic suppliers, frequently sending back sub-standard goods. It sources the majority of its inputs locally with just some high-technology parts imported from abroad. Mr Albulescu says the new technology and emphasis on quality have lifted the value of Astra's exports even though it has shed a third of its workforce, produces fewer wagons than in 1989 and is working at just 60 per cent capacity. Exports were Dollars 19.7m in 1993, up from Dollars 16.8m in 1989. The management, which has begun a restructuring plan, says it would like to see the company privatised, preferably by bringing in a strategic partner to help it update its technology. This is likely to take some time under Romania's slow-moving, bureaucratic privatisation programme, but Mr Albulescu says De Dietrich and Bombardier of Canada are already interested. 'The west is scared that Astra will soon be serious competition,' Mr Toduta says with a grin.</p>

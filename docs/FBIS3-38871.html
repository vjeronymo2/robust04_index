			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Charles Miller, PRESS ASSOCIATION defence correspondent] </F>   [Text] Crunch Cabinet talks on the Bosnia crisis will  tonight focus on ways to turn international disgust at the  Sarajevo massacre into a separate peace deal for the besieged  city.    Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind arrived in London from a  two-day visit to Bosnia saying the shelling of the Sarajevo  marketplace could prove to be a turning point.    The Government believes the Serbs are very much "on the back  foot" because of Saturday [5 February]'s atrocity, which killed  almost 70 people.    "What we are looking to do is to take advantage of this and  pressure the Serbs to force a settlement around Sarajevo and,  perhaps, even shorten the war itself," said one official.    Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic has stated that he  might  be prepared to negotiate a separate peace accord for Sarajevo.    NATO leaders are adamant that some good must emerge from  Saturday's carnage and ambassadors from the 16-nation alliance  are expected to reach a clear decision when they meet tomorrow.    The primary proposal is likely to be an ultimatum to the  Serbs to withdraw their artillery and mortar batteries out of  range of Sarajevo or face the threat of air strikes.    NATO would then insist on an agreement that the Muslims hold  back and that United Nations forces form a carefully controlled  buffer zone, similar to the green line in Cyprus.    UN troops would be pulled off other duties across the former  Yugoslavia to patrol the buffer zone.    There are hopes that a settlement around Sarajevo could  eventually lead to a more general peace across the rest of  Bosnia, where the Serbs are already in largely defensive  positions and content with their territorial gains.    "I think this could indeed be a turning-point," said Mr  Rifkind as he returned to London.    But he warned that decisions made over the next 48 hours  required clear political leadership rooted in sound military  judgement.    "Any initiatives we take must have a military coherence and  be consistent with what is achievable and sensible so that we  actually benefit the people of Bosnia," he said.    "I think it is very important to ensure the action taken in  the name of the UN is co-ordinated and coherent, and not  sporadic and ill-thought out.    "The crucial requirement is not simply to engineer some  event  that has a political impact but to take policy forward in a way  to produce results."    The ramifications of the Sarajevo massacre overshadowed the  original purpose of Mr Rifkind's visit to Bosnia, which was to  look at whether the humanitarian aid operation should continue.    The Government will make a final decision next month but the  defence secretary said aid was getting through and many people  would die if troops were withdrawn.    He was particularly pleased with the no-nonsense approach of  new UN commander, Lieutenant General Sir Michael Rose, which he  said proved aid could be delivered in a more effective way.</p>

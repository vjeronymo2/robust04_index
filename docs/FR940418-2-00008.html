			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Equityworthiness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to section 355.44(e)(1) of the Proposed Regulations (Countervailing Duties; Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and Request for Public Comments (``Proposed Regulations''), 54 FR 23366, May 31, 1989), we preliminarily determined that Terni, TAS, and ILVA were unequityworthy from 1978 through 1992, except in 1979, 1983, 1988, and 1989 when equity infusions were not an issue. From the perspective of a reasonable private investor examining the firm at the time of the equity infusions, neither Terni, TAS, nor ILVA showed an ability to earn a reasonable rate of return over a reasonable period of time. We did not learn anything at verification that would lead us to reverse this finding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As we stated in the preliminary determination, the companies which were restructured to form ILVA sustained losses from 1978 onward. Although ILVA had a brief period of operating profits for 1989 through 1991, its return on equity during this period declined until there was a negative return. Terni and ILVA's debt to equity ratios were relatively high. Read in conjunction with other financial indicators, such as net losses for numerous years, negative rates of return on equity and sales, the companies' financial performance was weak. Given this, we continue to find that Terni, TAS, and ILVA were unequityworthy from 1978 through 1992. Because the companies received no equity infusions during 1979, 1983, 1989, and 1990, we did not determine equityworthiness for those years. (See also Memorandum to Director of Accounting dated April 11, 1994 on file in Room B&hyph;099 of the Main Commerce Building concerning the Department's evaluation of Terni's, TAS', and ILVA's equityworthiness.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the preliminary determination, we did not include 1988 in our equityworthy analysis because petitioners did not allege an infusion had occurred in that year and we were not aware of any such investment. However, in our review of ILVA's annual reports at verification, we learned that IRI contributed capital to ILVA in 1988 in the form of an equity infusion. Therefore, in accordance with &sect;355.44(e)(2) of the Proposed Regulations, we have considered whether ILVA was equityworthy in that year to determine whether the equity infusion was made on terms inconsistent with commercial considerations. As explained below, we have determined that ILVA was not equityworthy in that year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Creditworthiness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to section 355.44(b)(6)(i) of the Proposed Regulations, we preliminarily determined that Terni, TAS, and ILVA were uncreditworthy,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> that they did not have sufficient revenues or resources to meet their costs and fixed financial obligations, from 1978 through 1992. In making that determination, we examined Terni's, TAS', and ILVA's current, quick, times interest earned and debt to equity ratios. We determined, for example, that the companies' times interest earned ratios were anemic for approximately 16 years, indicating a weak long-term solvency. Furthermore, the debt to equity ratios for both Terni and ILVA were relatively high. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We did not learn anything at verification that would lead us to reconsider our preliminary determination. Therefore, we continue to find that Terni, TAS, and ILVA were uncreditworthy from 1978 through 1992. (See also Memorandum to Director of Accounting dated April 11, 1994, on file in Room B&hyph;099 of the Main Commerce Building concerning the Department's evaluation of Terni's, TAS', and ILVA's creditworthiness.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Benchmarks and Discount Rates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For uncreditworthy companies, &sect;355.44(b)(6)(iv)(A)(1) of the Proposed Regulations directs us to use, as the benchmark interest rate, the highest long-term fixed interest rate commonly available to firms in the country plus an amount equal to 12 percent of the prime rate. Because we were unable to obtain information on the highest long-term interest rate commonly available in the country, we used the Bank of Italy reference rate which is the highest average long-term fixed interest rate we were able to verify. We then added to this rate an amount equal to 12 percent of the Italian Bankers Association (``ABI'') prime rate. We have used the resulting interest rate as the benchmark for our long-term loans. In calculations where we have not used this rate, we have otherwise indicated. We have also used this amount as the discount rate for allocating over time the benefit from equity infusions and non-recurring grants for the same reasons explained in Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Certain Steel Products From Spain, 58 FR 37374, 37376 (July 9, 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

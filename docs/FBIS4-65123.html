			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sebastiano Messina: "The Great Chamberlain Who </F> Is a Power Game Professional"]    [Excerpt] Rome -- [passage omitted] Who, then, is Gianni  Letta, the man whom [Prime Minister-designate] Berlusconi wants  by his side at Palazzo Chigi [office of the prime minister]?  The post of under secretary to the prime minister -- which was  once filled by [former Prime Ministers] Giulio Andreotti and  Giuliano Amato -- will very soon be occupied by the tireless  navigator of the sea of Italian politics, the soloist of drawing  room diplomacy, the Second Republic's great chamberlain. Nobody  is better qualified to guide the inexperienced prime minister  along the insidious paths of the former party empire. Letta  knows all its inhabitants, and, for all of them, he had a word  of praise, a compliment, a piece of flattery.    From Abruzzo, just turned 59 (precisely on the day when the  new parliamentarians took up their duties), Gianni Letta started  busying himself very early in life. If, at home, he was the  second of lawyer Vincenzo Letta's eight children, at the  Avezzano lycee he was top of the class. At 18, he decided to  earn his own living and applied for a job at the Torlonia sugar  mills. He was hired as a laborer. The following year he had  joined the administrative staff. Two years later he was  promoted to manager in the chemistry department.    However, Letta was more interested in newspapers than in  sugar. He started sending articles to IL TEMPO in Rome, and was  immediately noticed. They gave him a post in Aquila, then in  the Rome office, and his rise continued . A career like many  others -- until Renato Angiolillo appointed him editorial  secretary. This was a key position: In fact, young Letta  became the mouthpiece of the newspaper's founder-director-chief  editor. As Angiolillo grew older, the young man rose higher:  executive officer, managing director, and finally director.    Once at the top, he looked around and developed a passion  for  electronic media: television. There was not a single debate of  which he was not a protagonist, not a single round table which  could start without him. Letta quietly disseminated his  moderate common sense. Only once did he lose his temper, on  [Fininvest talk-show host] Costanzo's show. During a debate on  heart transplants, he and professor Azzolina exchanged some  scathing remarks (a long survey on heart transplant followed in  several issues of IL TEMPO).    When he was not appearing on TV, Letta spent his evenings in  Maria Angiolillo's (the wife of IL TEMPO's founder) living room,  where the capital's most powerful men -- including Andreotti,  Rumor, Bisaglia, and Fanfani -- have met for the past 30 years.  Yet, late at night, Letta never failed to visit the editorial  office: Not a single item was published without his approval.    Legal problems also arose at one point: Cornered into a  tight spot, Ettore Bernabei told the judges that he had handed  over 1.5 billion lire in CCT's [treasury credit certificates],  which had been taken from the IRI's [Institute for Industrial  Reconstruction] hidden funds. Letta shrugged his shoulders:  "The IRI was funding a promotional campaign. How could we know  the money was dirty?" However, the newspaper was beginning to  misfire, and its director decided the moment had come to quit.  However, his holiday did not last for long. Three months later  Silvio Berlusconi appointed him as his ambassador to the  political elite in Rome. They had a clear-cut agreement:  Berlusconi had only one friend, called Bettino [Craxi]; Letta  had to take care of the others.    He did very well at his job. He was the discreet manager of  the Fininvest counteroffensive over the Mammi law [on  broadcasting], suffering, over each of Veltroni's amendments  which was passed. Then, when Berlusconi tried to turn the  Mondadori publishing house into an empire, Letta acted as an  ambassador with LA REPUBBLICA's besieged staff. It was at his  home that Berlusconi and Scalfari first met, on the evening when  LA REPUBBLICA's chief editor told Berlusconi: "Let us address  each other informally. Otherwise I cannot discuss an  agreement." This was one of the few battles that Berlusconi did  not manage to win.    Within Fininvest he behaved with skillful tact. He did not  ask for anything for himself, he did not ever show himself in  the editorial offices, he only appeared in the studios for his  own show ("Italy Asks"), until the Rome public prosecutor  requested his arrest over the frequency scandal. The Court of  Cassation blocked the arrest, but Letta himself decided to  suspend his broadcasts. He remained behind the scenes also  during Berlusconi's drive to enter the political scene (which  Letta had advised him against doing), although he acted as a  "guarantor" for Fininvest's polling information. Few were aware  of this, apart from Giuliano Ferrara, who saw his last-minute  appeal to vote for Berlusconi censored.    Last famous words: "I like to watch and judge politics,  rather than experience them from within." As from next week,  you will find him at Palazzo Chigi.</p>

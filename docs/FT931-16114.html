			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / International Company News: Zuckerman seals NY Daily News takeover MR Mortimer Zuckerman, the real estate investor and magazine publisher, yesterday completed his acquisition of The Daily News, the New York tabloid newspaper once owned by the late Mr Robert Maxwell. The Canadian-born Mr Zuckerman, who already owns the weekly US News &amp; World Report and The Atlantic, an upmarket monthly literary and political magazine, is expected to assume ownership of the newspaper today. . become chairman and co-publisher of The Daily News, while Mr Fred Drasner, a close associate, will be chief executive and co-publisher. Mr Drasner, who shares management responsibility with Mr Zuckerman at US News &amp; World Report, has played a leading role in reaching agreements with nine of the 10 trade unions at The Daily News, which has a daily circulation of nearly 800,000. Although the actual purchase price has not been disclosed, it is believed to be in the region of Dollars 36m. Mr Zuckerman, who is also editor-in-chief of US News &amp; World Report, has overcome financial, trade union and legal obstacles in his quest for the New York paper in recent months. While The Daily News has been making losses, Mr Zuckerman has said he is confident he will return the paper to the black, in part by luring back lost advertising with improved political, business and investigative coverage. Last autumn, Mr Zuckerman succeeded in striking accords with union representatives who preferred his offer to that of Mr Conrad Black, the Canadian who owns The Daily Telegraph in London. More recently, he has won a court battle with the typographers' union, which previously held life-time employment contracts. The one union that has been least willing to yield to Mr Zuckerman's request for freedom to hire and fire editorial staff has been the Newspaper Guild.</p>

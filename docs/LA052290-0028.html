			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> K mart Corp.: The Troy, Mich.-based retailer said first-quarter profit rose to  $100.1 million, a 6.4% increase over the same period in 1989, while sales rose  16.1% to $7.04 billion.  </P> <P> Sales on a comparable store basis -- those stores open at least one year --  were up 6.2%. However, interest expense rose 70.2% due to larger short-term  borrowings, and gross margin dipped from 27.9% to 26% reflecting lower shelf  prices. The company said profit improvements resulted from increased sales,  cost controls and favorable weather conditions for sales of seasonal  merchandise.  </P></p>

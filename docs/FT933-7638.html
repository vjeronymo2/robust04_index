			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Technology: Secret boost for welding process - Worth Watching A welding technique, developed by the Paton Institute, in Kiev, promises to increase Tig (tungsten inert gas) welding productivity in the west by a factor of 10. The process involves painting the metal parts to be welded with a non-toxic paint which constricts the arc inside the metal during the welding. While stainless steel or titanium welds of 2-3mm are common outside the Ukraine, the Paton Institute regularly welds metals 10mm thick, using the same amount of gas. The institute, which is represented by the Welding Institute in Cambridge, is keeping the chemical formulation a closely guarded secret. Paton Institute: Ukraine, 44 227 4353.

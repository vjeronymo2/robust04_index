			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Shake-up at Ford: Europe to handle smaller-sized cars Ford has chosen to locate only one of its planned five global vehicle programme centres in Europe. However, the US carmaker insists that European technical staffs are being given responsibility for one of the group's main growth sectors. Ford's announcement that it is embarking on the most radical organisational shake-up in its 91-year history, means that the traditionally independent Ford of Europe is to be merged with the carmaker's North American operations into a single operating unit, Ford Automotive Operations with its headquarters in Dearborn, near Detroit. However, the European vehicle programme centre (VPC) will take on the worldwide responsibility, for the design, development and engineering of all of the Ford group's small and medium-sized frontwheel drive cars. These include the Fiesta, Escort and Mondeo in Europe and the Escort (different to the European model) and Ford Contour/Mercury Mystique in North America. Ford imports into the US the Ford Aspire, a small car, from Kia, the South Korean carmaker. These are the world's highest volume car segments and Ford expects large growth in this sector as it expands its share of emerging markets. Ford said crucial decisions on the locations of the VPCs had been based on which part of its organisation had the greater experience and expertise. 'Europe has demonstrated the best capability in designing and producing small/medium cars and engines as well as manual transmissions. North America has the greater experience base in larger cars, trucks and higher displacement engines and automatic transmissions,' the group said. Under the Ford reorganisation each vehicle programme centre will have worldwide responsibility for the design, development and engineering of the vehicles assigned to it. An important step in the creation of global operations will mean responsibility for the manufacturing plants around the world will fall to the relevant vehicle programme centre. This will mean that Ford's small-medium car plants in the US will be managed from Europe, for example. This is likely only to happen in practice, as Ford manages to introduce more common products around the world, but the pattern has been set by its recent project to develop a world car in the shape of the Mondeo family car, launched in Europe early last year. The European vehicle programme centre will take on responsibility for the Genk plant in Belgium that produces the Mondeo, plants in Kansas in the US and in Cuautitlan, Mexico, which produce the North American versions. It does admit that under the new global structure 'product development management in the new organisation will obviously want to explore how the European-based vehicle programme centre can operate most effectively.' This delicate task will fall most immediately to Mr Richard Parry-Jones, previously Ford of Europe's chief engineer for vehicle engineering. He now becomes vice-president of the global small and medium frontwheel drive vehicle programme centre, and the only one of the five vehicle programme centre vice-presidents, who will be based in Europe. Ford's most ambitious attempt to develop a world car, the Dollars 6bn Mondeo programme, was led by Ford of Europe, and under the new structure the European VPC would lead the effort to develop a single world car programme to replace Ford's two separate Escorts. 'The timing on this is fantastic,' said Mr Jacques Nasser, who is leaving chairman of Ford of Europe to become group vice-president for global product development. 'This gives us the opportunity to put together a world programme for the Escort and to have one platform for that vehicle throughout the world.' This begs the question as to how Mazda, Ford's 25 per cent owned Japanese affiliate would be integrated into such a global programme. Ford's present North American Escort was essentially engineered by Mazda and derived from the Mazda 323 small family car.</p>

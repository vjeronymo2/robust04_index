			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. HOLDS UP $230 MILLION IN AID FOR EGYPT  </P> <P> The United States is holding up $230 million in aid for Egypt because President  Hosni Mubarak's government has failed to adopt acceptable economic reforms,  State Department spokesman Charles Redman said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Redman denied that the aid was contingent on Egypt's agreeing with the  International Monetary Fund on an economic austerity package.  </P> <P> Egyptian sources said, however, that the United States is tying its decision to  IMF conditions, which they said may be applicable in general but would be  difficult to implement in Egypt because of the low incomes of many.  </P> <P> The sources noted recent rioting over IMF reforms in Venezuela and Algeria.  </P></p>

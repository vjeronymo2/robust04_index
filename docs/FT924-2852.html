			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: Finland to inject further FM15bn into bank sector THE Finnish government plans to inject a further FM15bn (Dollars 3bn) of capital into the ailing Finnish banking sector next year, on top of the FM28bn rescue package already committed. Mr Sixten Korkman, director general of the Finnish Ministry of Finance, said the estimate was 'on the safe side', so that further injections would not be needed in the future. The support package, set up in March, consists of FM8bn in the form of preferred stock and FM20bn in the form of a guarantee fund. The package is designed to ward off the threat of a credit crunch and prevent any bank collapses. Finnish banks experienced losses of around FM20bn this year due to the high level of corporate loan defaults. But the Finnish prime minister, Mr Esko Aho, said the structural changes required to strengthen the position of Finland's banks were underway, citing Skopbank's 30 per cent reduction in staffing levels and the takeover of STS-Bank by Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, the country's largest bank. 'The ability of the Finnish banking sector to rebound from its current difficulties is largely dependent on the country's economic recovery,' said Mr John Gibling, an analyst at Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency. Analysts warned the scope for further potential problems is hard to predict, since it is not known how many small and medium-sized Finnish companies are still on the brink of collapse. However, after declines of 2 per cent this year and 6 per cent last year, the government forecast of 2 per cent economic growth next year is described as realistic. 'Such a bounce from a very low base is certainly possible,' said Mr David Longmuir at James Capel. 'But it will be up to the export industry, because with unemployment running at 16 per cent consumers are very cautious.' The need to inject further capital into the banking system, coupled with the financial strain of high unemployment, will hold the government's funding requirement at a high level next year. The borrowing programme, split between the international and domestic bond markets, will total close to FM60bn, according to Mr Korkman. But bond traders are not convinced that the government will be able to raise half the programme domestically, due to foreign investors' aversion to the domestic market after suffering two currency devaluations in little over a year. The level of borrowing is expected to diminish in 1994, assuming next year's growth target is met. Mr Aho also reiterated his government's commitment to re-linking the Finnish markka to other European currencies, following the currency's devaluation in September. Moody's, US rating agency, has lowered the ratings of Postipankki's FM1.7bn of debt to A1 from Aa2. The downgrade applies only to debt issued after 1988, since earlier issues benefit from a guarantee from the Republic of Finland. Debt issued after that date benefit from a government guarantee fund but 'the amount of support available is limited,' according to Moody's.</p>

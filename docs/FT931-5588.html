			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Mirror Group trustees object to pension payout TRUSTEES FOR the Mirror Group Pension Scheme are objecting to a proposal that would allow Maxwell company pensioners to start drawing monthly payments on the Pounds 188m Common Investment Fund which holds the assets of all four schemes. The trustees for the four Maxwell schemes have to agree on the basis of distribution from the fund before any scheme can receive money. The government's Pounds 2.5m 'drip-feed' to pay pensioners is nearly exhausted and those in the Maxwell Communication Staff Scheme and the Maxwell Communication Works Scheme could face cuts in payments after April if a resolution is not agreed. Trustees of the four schemes will meet next week to try to reach an agreement which will allow each scheme to make some withdrawals. The dispute centres on the method used to calculate the percentage of the fund allocated to each scheme. Liquidators of Bishopsgate Investment Management, the fund management company which was controlled by the late Robert Maxwell and which managed the Common Investment Fund while he was alive, have been unable to say which assets belong to which scheme. Bishopsgate failed to keep accurate records of how much each scheme contributed to the fund, and its records do not accurately record the date several substantial blocks of assets were transferred out to banks or to Maxwell's private interests. The liquidators, Robson Rhodes, have presented the trustees of all the schemes with 11 different methods of calculating each scheme's share of the common fund. Several of these show some schemes to owe the common fund money. While the trustees of the Maxwell Private Company Scheme, the works scheme and the staff scheme are said to agree broadly that requiring pension schemes to pay money into the fund is unrealistic, Mirror Group Pension Scheme trustees are said to be baulking at some of the proposals. About 30 MPs have expressed concern that some trustees are carrying out their duties 'insensitively'. Sir John Cuckney, chairman of a trust fund which has been collecting contributions from companies that had dealings with Maxwell companies, has given no firm assurances to the pension schemes that the Pounds 6m he has raised so far will be available for monthly pension payments if assets in the common fund remain off-limits.</p>

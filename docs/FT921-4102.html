			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Canada acts in lumber row today THE Canadian cabinet will today consider retaliatory action against the US for a 14.5 per cent duty imposed by the Commerce Department last week on softwood lumber exports from Canada. The lumber ruling, coming on top of several other trade rows between Ottawa and Washington, has increased political pressure on Mr Brian Mulroney, Canada's prime minister, to hit back at the Americans. Both opposition parties have called for retaliatory measures. Mr Bob Rae, Ontario's premier, urged Mr Mulroney to work more closely with other countries hurt by US protectionism. Although Canada is the US's biggest market, with imports totalling CDollars 93bn (Pounds 45bn) last year, Ottawa is hesitant to take any measures which could widen trade frictions. In an interview with the Financial Times last week, Mr Mulroney said: 'I'm not big on gunboat diplomacy, but we are not without our own resources'. The Canadians want to avoid any action which would jeopardise the 1989 free trade agreement with the US, or the present round of trilateral talks including Mexico to create a North American free trade area (Nafta). Mr Mulroney, President George Bush and President Salinas de Gortari of Mexico are due to discuss progress in the Nafta talks by phone next Monday. Canada has already lodged a complaint with Gatt over the softwood lumber duty, imposed to compensate for the alleged subsidy to Canadian sawmills of low tree-cutting fees in provincial forests and curbs on log exports. Ottawa also plans to refer the lumber issue to a binational dispute settlement panel under the 1989 US-Canada free trade pact. It is expected to call for a panel to consider the recent US Customs Service decision that Honda cars assembled in Ontario do not have enough North American content to qualify for duty-free access under the FTA. The extra duty on Canadian lumber has halted export orders from the US for the time being. Mr Roy Carroll, president of Angus Forest Products, a Toronto-based wholesaler, said sawmills in British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec have raised prices 15 per cent since last Friday. US buyers bought heavily ahead of the ruling, and are thought to have substantial inventories. Many US home-builders have rallied to the Canadians' side, noting the extra duty imposed at a time of strong demand could raise the price of an average home by about Dollars 1,000 (Pounds 568). Canadian sawmills export more than CDollars 3bn of lumber a year south of the border and have roughly 25 per cent of the US market. Editorial comment, Page 18</p>

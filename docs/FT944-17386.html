			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / UK Company News: London Electricity London Electricity has joined the distribution companies which have bought their own shares. Yesterday it spent Pounds 103.2m for a 7 per cent holding at 672p a share. The company said there was no particular reason buying the shares yesterday, permission for which was granted at the August annual meeting. However it had to move before its close season in a week's time. It is able to buy a further 3 per cent but further purchases are unlikely in the short term. The shares closed 2p lower at 683p.</p>

			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Russia plans more tax on western films - Protection sought for local industry Russia is threatening to impose additional duties on imported western films and videos to help protect the country's stricken film industry and deter video piracy. The move is likely to cause consternation among western film producers, although they are hopeful the decision may be reconsidered. Mr Yuri Vasyuchkov, a senior official at the state cinema committee, yesterday said a new tax, equivalent to 350 minimum monthly salaries (Dollars 2,700), would be imposed on imported films this month. The proceeds of the new tax would be redistributed to Russian film studios. 'Film distributors will now have to pay fees to screen foreign films in Russia. To some extent this will provide help to our cash-strapped film studios,' he said. However, some award-winning films, children's features, non-commercial documentaries and films produced in association with Russian companies would be exempt from the new tax, Mr Vasyuchkov said. The proposal has already aroused the ire of western film producers and distributors, who claim the tax would double the cost of distribution. 'It is an absolutely ridiculous situation and we hope that they will soon see sense,' said one film studio representative yesterday. Others suggested the move would result in greater piracy of films. The once-proud Russian film industry, which was accorded great importance in the Soviet era as one of the chief instruments of propaganda, is experiencing a drastic crisis of confidence. Cinema audiences are estimated to have plummeted to only 10 per cent of the levels they were a decade ago. Most of the film studios at Mosfilm, the Soviet equivalent of Hollywood, now stand idle or are being used by independent producers to make advertisements or pop music videos. Only four films are currently in production compared with more than 50 a year in Mosfilm's glory days. The growth of other forms of entertainment, such as home videos, has also eroded the cinema's appeal, as has the squeeze on household incomes because of the upheavals in the Russian economy. As in eastern Europe, western companies operating in Russia have trouble defending intellectual copyrights. Piracy of film, music, computer and book rights is widespread. In one recent example, Dame Barbara Cartland, the British author of prim romantic novels, was incensed to discover that Russian editions of her books contained erotic drawings. Piracy is rife in the film industry. Street kiosks sell pirated copies of western films and regional and cable television companies frequently show copied western films. Industry estimates suggest about 64m blank video cassettes were officially imported into Russia last year, compared with only 7,500 pre-recorded cassettes.</p>

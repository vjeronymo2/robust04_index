			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / Companies confident on productivity THE COMPETITIVENESS of British industry will continue to improve because of the impact of high unemployment on wage costs and labour flexibility, a survey by the 3i venture-capital group says today. Responses from 1,000 finance directors of the UK's biggest public companies show them to be overwhelmingly confident that industry will continue to narrow the productivity gap with the world's most efficient economies, and that the benefits of last year's devaluation can be sustained. Respondents cited high unemployment and wider public awareness of the need to retain competitiveness as explanations for their confidence. More than two-thirds of the finance directors said the competitive gains of devaluation would not be whittled away. Mr John Platt, executive director of 3i, said: 'There is every sign that 1993 will show a rise in productivity higher than any we have seen since the early 1980s.' The group's findings follow government figures showing that unit labour costs are falling, while productivity has reached its highest levels for 6 1/2 years. Manufacturing wages and salaries per unit of output were 3 per cent lower in the three months to June than in the same period a year before. Manufacturing productivity - output per head - was 1.3 per cent higher in the second quarter compared with the first, and 8.2 per cent higher than in the same three-month period a year earlier. Mr Platt said: 'Finance directors view these improvements as a change in the fundamentals of British industry, not as a short-term windfall resulting from the recession.' The directors said a sharper focus on core activities and increased capital investment had contributed to higher productivity.</p>

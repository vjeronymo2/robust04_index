			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with John Garang, leader of the Sudanese People's </F> Liberation Army, SPLA, by 'Afaf Zayn; place and date not given]    [Excerpts] [Zayn] Since the issuance of the Washington  declarartion, the National Democratic Grouping [NDG] has not  been able to convene its congress and adopt a unified stand on  the peoples' right to self-determination in southern Sudan and  the neglected areas. This is despite the fact that the SPLA  considers self-determination a firm strategic position that it  will discuss with the Sudanese Government under the sponsorship  of the IFAD [International Fund for Agricultural Development]  states. Are you concerned over the NDG's failure to reach a  unified stand on the principle of self-determination?    [Garang] All the constitutional documents endorsed by the  NDG, the last of which was the Nairobi declaration, include the  right of the south and the neglected areas to  self-determination. In light of this, the failure to reach an  agreement on a meeting to reformulate what has previously been  accepted is a political setback that cannot be understood. The  right to self-determination is a basic component of democracy  and human rights. Therefore, if the NDG denies this right of  the people of the south and the neglected area, the parties to  the NDG will be placed on an equal footing with the party  oppressing the people in the south and their ethnic and  religious sects.    I believe that the basic issue that must be discussed is not  just the right to self-determination, but also the objective  circumstances that forced broad sectors of the Sudanese people  to demand the right to self-determination. The scheduled  meeting of the NDG will not discuss the right to  self-determination, but will reach agreement on the best way to  topple the Sudanese regime and to reach an understanding on  running the country in the stage that will follow the downfall  of the regime.    In the past, I proposed Harare as a possible venue for the  NDG meeting. Cairo was also mentioned as a possible venue. The  meeting will be held when the appropriate circumstances become  available. [passage omitted]    [Zayn] If the NDG fails to adopt a position supporting the  right to self-determination, which the SPLA views as a basic  point in its negotiating strategy, what will be the fate of the  alliance?    [Garang] The NDG parties cannot reject the principle of  self-determination after they have already accepted it as an  article in constitutional documents worked out by the alliance.  I think that the collapse of the current regime in Khartoum  will lead to a stage where there will be no need to call for  self-determination when the reasons that led to these calls are  removed. But if the call for self-determination continues after  the collapse of the current regime, it will mean that the  successor regime has also failed to offer a final solution to  the problems in Sudan. [passage omitted]    [Zayn] If certain influential northern voices within the  alliance continue to reject the right to self-determination  despite their previous acceptance and their commitment to the  constitutional documents that contain this principle, and if the  SPLA -- with its two wings -- continues to adhere to the right  to self-determination for the south and the neglected areas,  will the NDG remain a viable alliance framework between the SPLA  and the northern parties, despite this dilemma that is  threatening its existence? What form of relations link you to  your allies in the northern parties?    [Garang] Our alliance is, in the first place, with the  Sudanese people, and these relations are based on joint efforts  to topple the current regime. If this objective is not  realized, stability and peace in the region around Sudan will be  in question. The current regime wants to incite instability and  political confusion, and wants to strike at the peaceful  coexistence in eastern Africa and the Middle East. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Banks attacked for curbs on poor BANKS ARE denying poorer people and those in debt access to current accounts, and should be legally regulated to ensure open access to their services, the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux said yesterday. In a strong attack on the way in which banks and building societies have interpreted their code of practice since it was introduced in March last year, the association said they were failing to observe both 'the spirit and the detail'. The association, which represents 1,300 bureaux providing advice on 250,000 cases of bank debt each year, argued that banks are now closing current accounts held by debtors and refusing to open new ones for those on low incomes. In its submission to the committee headed by Sir George Blunden which is reviewing the code, the association said the banks' behaviour was such that a statutory code was now required to ensure open access to their services. The association's criticisms are among the fiercest yet submitted to Sir George's committee, which is considering changes to the code to be introduced from March next year. Yesterday was the formal deadline for submissions. The association said it was finding an increasing number of cases of people on low incomes or in debt having their current accounts closed by banks or being turned down without explanation when they applied to open an account. Ms Ann Abraham, the association's chief executive, said it was urging the review committee to act to ensure that people were not refused accounts without explanation, and were not put under undue pressure by banks reclaiming debts. The association said if a statutory code was not introduced, banks and building societies should improve the monitoring and enforcement mechanisms for the voluntary one. Banks cannot avoid responsibility for losses suffered by their credit-card customers in cases of breach of contract and misrepresentation by retailers, Sir Bryan Carsberg, the director-general of fair trading, said yesterday. He did not accept the argument by some banks that they did not bear equal responsibility with the retailer if they had no contract with the retailer to process the card transaction. Some banks have argued that if they are only responsible for issuing the purchaser's card they are not liable because they have no contract with the retailer. 'I do not agree with them,' Sir Bryan told an Institute of Trading Standards conference. The Chartered Institute of Bankers and the Chartered Building Societies Institute merge today. Mr Brian Pearse, CIB president, said the new group was better placed to maintain ethical standards.</p>

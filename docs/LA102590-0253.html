			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: HAVE A BITTER PILL TO SWALLOW? NEW METHODS MAY PROVE SWEET  </P> <P> Americans hate shots and love pills. Latin Americans believe that shots are  real medicine and do not complain nearly as much as their northern neighbors.  The French, on the other hand, are big on suppositories.  </P> <P> Pharmaceutical wizards are moving way past such crude methods of drug delivery  as tablets, shots, lotions, liquids and drops. High technology is entering the  drugstore and is providing people with better ways of getting drugs where they  belong.  </P> <P> A whole generation grew up believing that when you swallowed a pill it went  straight to the place it was needed, like a guided missile. Television  commercials, like the one for a popular headache remedy, used a simplistic  picture of a man with a hammer pounding in his head. The advertised solution  sped right to the spot and stopped his hammer.  </P> <P> Tablets, capsules, syrups and even suppositories must be absorbed from the  digestive tract into the bloodstream. From there the active ingredients are  spread from your nose to your toes through the bloodstream. All this can delay  the benefits of the medicine. Additionally, the entire body is exposed to the  chemicals, and side effects may result.  </P> <P> Scientists are coming up with far more efficient systems and will be able to  target drugs even more accurately than the television ad implied.  </P> <P> Nicorette (nicotine resin) looks like chewing gum. It is actually a  sophisticated drug delivery system that allows nicotine to be absorbed through  the mucosal tissue in the mouth.  </P> <P> There will soon be a nicotine patch that can be worn like an adhesive bandage.  The nicotine will be absorbed through the skin directly into the bloodstream.  Like Nicorette, this medication should help smokers who want to quit.  </P> <P> Chemists are coming up with other ways to achieve long-lasting action.  Norplant, inserted beneath the skin, releases contraceptive hormones for up to  five years' protection from pregnancy.  </P> <P> According to Dr. Robert Langer in Science magazine, tetracycline can combat  periodontal disease at 1/1,000th the oral dose when it is inserted into the gum  in a slow-release polymer form.  </P> <P> Most exciting of all are the monoclonal antibodies produced by genetic  engineering. When a drug is attached to one of these specialized antibodies, it  truly does home in on the targeted cell. Researchers hope this approach will  produce far greater success against septic shock, cancer and AIDS.  </P></p>

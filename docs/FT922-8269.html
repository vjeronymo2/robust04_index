			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Perot would win in California says poll PRESIDENT George Bush and Governor Bill Clinton are moving steadily towards a confrontation in November, in the US presidential election, each having won two more primaries on Tuesday. But a new opinion poll showed that, in California, the largest state, they would both be beaten by Mr Ross Perot, the Texas businessman mounting an independent challenge for the presidency. Some analysts suggest that the disgruntled people most likely to tell a pollster that they would vote for Mr Perot are also the least likely to vote. But his supporters have surprised many with their ability to collect enough signatures to put his name on the ballot in states from Texas to Maine. Mr Bush was assured of the Republican party's presidential nomination before he took more than 80 per cent of the vote in Nebraska and West Virginia this week. In the Democratic primaries, Mr Clinton won Nebraska with 48 per cent and West Virginia with 74 per cent. In the latter, he kept his challenger, former Governor Jerry Brown of California, below 15 per cent, thereby taking all 31 of the state's delegates to the Democratic convention which will anoint the party's presidential candidate in July. Many political pundits have called the Arkansas governor's results disappointing, but he has scored as well as Mr Michael Dukakis, the Democratic nominee in 1988, at this stage of the campaign.</p>

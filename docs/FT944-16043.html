			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Lord Taylor raps race offence plan A specific offence of racially motivated violence would reduce the prosecution's ability to secure convictions, the Lord Chief Justice warned last night. Lord Taylor said: 'The new offence would, by creating a whole new element for the prosecution to prove, actually have reduced their ability to secure convictions.' Lord Taylor, speaking to the National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders' race issues advisory council, also rejected a recommendation from the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice that, in some cases, juries should be required to contain a quota of people from the ethnic minorities.</p>

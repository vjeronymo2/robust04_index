			<p>BFN     [Text] Phnom Penh, May 18 (XINHUA) -- King Norodom Sihanouk  of Cambodia left here this morning for Beijing, China, to resume  treatment for cancer.    The king was accompanied by his wife Queen Monique.    They were seen off at the airport by first Prime Minister  Norodom Ranariddh, Second Prime Minister Hun Sen, parliament  speaker Chea Sim and Chinese Ambassador to Cambodia Xie Yue'e  [name as received].    The 72-year-old king made a surprise announcement last week  that he would leave for China on May 18 to resume chemotherapy  treatment for cancer. Originally, he had planned to stay in his  country until June 2 and then pay his first official visit to  China after becoming king.    King Sihanouk returned to Cambodia on April 8 after six  months of treatment for cancer in Beijing. While in Cambodia,  he launched a number of proposals for peace in order to hasten  the national reconciliation process.</p>

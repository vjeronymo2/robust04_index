			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 25 Jun (PL) -- Ricardo Alarcon, president of  the National Assembly of the People's Government, said today  that the certainty that Cuba is capable of surmounting the  adverse economic situation resulting from the loss of its  commercial allies is becoming more accepted throughout the world  all the time.    In a speech delivered in the western province of Matanzas,  some 100 km east of the capital, Alarcon pointed out that this  fact is increasing the anger of the enemies of the revolution  that first arose in 1959.    The legislative leader said that in spite of the tightening  of the blockade imposed on the island by the United States over  three decades ago, a growing number of foreign investors are  interested in establishing joint enterprises with Cuba.    According to a report by the National Information Agency  (AIN), every day more businessmen become interested in investing  in our country, despite the blockade and U.S. hostility, Alarcon  emphasized.    Alarcon also mentioned the Canadian Government's  announcement  this week that it would resume official assistance to the  country.    Cuba has been experiencing an adverse economic situation  since the disappearance of the European socialist bloc led by  the former USSR, with which Cuba conducted 85 percent of its  trade.</p>

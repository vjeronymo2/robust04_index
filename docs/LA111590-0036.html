			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: STAGE / NANCY CHURNIN: GASLAMP THEATER GAMBLES ON 'FRANKIE  AND JOHNNY'  </P> <P> The Gaslamp Quarter Theatre Company has exactly two weeks before opening  Terrence McNally's "Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune" at the Hahn  Cosmopolitan Theatre. But it has have miles to go, financially speaking, before  it opens.  </P> <P> "We're in -- as can be expected in the two weeks before mounting the show -- a  tight situation. We need to raise $50,000," said the Gaslamp's managing  director Steve Bevans, adding, however, that the theater has some "good  prospects" for the money.  </P> <P> But they don't have the money yet.  </P> <P> One prospect for the deficit-plagued theater is getting "Frankie and Johnny" on  stage. Bevans acknowledges that the chances for launching next year's season  hinge on the San Diego premiere of this Off-Broadway being a hit. (A $5 sneak  preview to the show's last dress rehearsal Nov. 25 is available through the San  Diego Theatre League.)  </P> <P> Pam Grier and William Anton will co-star at the Hahn in this love story about a  short-order cook trying to persuade a wary waitress that they are meant for  more than just a quick passionate encounter.  </P> <P> Bevans said he is hoping for $75,000 in single-ticket sales to help finance the  theater's next season. The entire deficit, however, runs as high as $850,000 to  $1 million.  </P> <P> If all goes well, Bevans said, the company will announce its 1991-1992 season  in January. It will begin with Alan Ayckbourn's "A Woman in Mind" in late  January or early February for a six-week run, which will complete the suspended  1990 Hahn Cosmopolitan subscription series. The season is scheduled to continue  in April of 1991 and play through March of 1992. There will be gaps in the  season open to rental shows -- probably during the summer months.  </P> <P> Nearly 80-85% of the Gaslamp's Elizabeth North subscribers exchanged one of the  shows they were owed from the canceled season for "Dusk to Dawn at the Sunset,"  a co-production with Ensemble Arts Theatre that will run through Nov. 25.  Bevans said he is happy with the turnout for "Dusk to Dawn" -- which averages  houses of 60-95% -- and is talking to Ensemble Arts about future  co-productions.  </P> <P> If you've seen Sheri Glaser's one-woman show, "Family Secrets" at the Hahn  Cosmopolitan, you know all about Mort, his long-suffering wife, Bev, their  daughters Sandra and Fern (who renamed herself Kahari) and Grandma Rose, who  just discovered octogenarian love.  </P> <P> But, unless you've caught the show in the last two weeks, you may have missed a  new character: a spiritual channeler named Miguel, who is married to  Fern/Kahari.  </P> <P> The Mexican-born Miguel is not officially part of the show yet; Glaser still  considers him "a work-in-progress."  </P> <P> He comes out after the curtain closes on Glaser's five other characters. And he  will continue to appear at each show until "Family Secrets" ends Sunday.  </P> <P> Miguel wears a brightly colored bandanna, a green sharkskin suit, a black  T-shirt and a beard. He's also the only character without a Bronx accent. And  he's the only character who asks for audience participation.  </P> <P> "He lets another entity in who died thousands of years ago. Kumbiya," Glaser  said on the phone from Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Kumbiya? That's right, Glaser said, spelling the name. As in "Someone singing  my Lord, Kumbiya."  </P> <P> Kumbiya is a person in that song?  </P> <P> Glaser laughed. "To me he is."  </P> <P> "The way to get Kumbiya to come is to sing the song. Then Kumbiya asks the  people if they have some questions for him."  </P> <P> Some of the questions that have come from the audience are:  </P> <P> What's going to happen to Dianne Feinstein? and Will there be a war in the  Middle East?  </P> <P> Kumbiya's answers?  </P> <P> "Dianne will stay away on a long vacation, and if we keep thinking there will  be a war, there will be. It is up to us to meditate. Life is like a salad bar.  You can come up as many times as you like and put different things on your  plate, and one day you'll have dessert."  </P> <P> Part of Miguel's imagery comes from his former life as a waiter at a health  food restaurant, which is how he met Kahari.  </P> <P> She ordered cream of mushroom soup and he advised against it. He told her she  was probably allergic to cow's milk and guessed that her mother didn't breast  feed her. She cried and he held her for a while.  </P> <P> For Miguel's character, Glaser is still working out slides and music, which  accompany all the other characters. Her creative team is taking shots of the  people Miguel fashions himself after: Gandhi, Buddha, Joan of Arc and Mother  Teresa. She expects to have the presentation firmed up enough to give Miguel a  slot in the show right after intermission when "Family Secrets" reopens at Los  Angeles' Heliotrope Theatre on Nov. 24.  </P> <P> Glaser is also expecting investors at the Los Angeles run who may be interested  in financing a New York production of the show. Meanwhile, she is working on a  "Family Secrets" script for Showtime.  </P> <P> "If they buy the show, we'll do it like a special and maybe spin off a series,  and then they'll cast the characters with other people," said Glaser. "Now that  will really be weird."  </P> <P> PROGRAM NOTES: Thomas Hall has been trying to bring the Maly Theatre of  Leningrad back to the Old Globe Theatre for about a year. Now, the Maly  recently signed an agreement with the Stamford (Conn.) Theatre to appear there  next fall. That could be the start of the consortium Hall is trying to assemble  to defray the costs of a Maly visit. "I'm hopeful that it will anchor the  beginning of a tour," the Globe's managing director said. . . .  </P> <P> The current United States International University production of "Who's Afraid  of Virginia Woolf?" at the Theatre in Old Town has attracted the attention of  the American College Theatre Festival, an annual competition to find the best  productions and performers. Three judges have seen it, and three more are  scheduled to see it Sunday, closing night. A decision will be made by the end  of December as to whether it will go to Sonoma Valley for a regional contest.  The winner there will head to the John F. Kennedy Center in Washington in  March. . . .  </P> <P> The San Diego Actors Theatre will sponsor what it hopes will be the first  annual San Diego Actors' Festival Feb. 3-10. The event, which will be held at  Sushi Performance Gallery, will feature three to four one-acts per evening and  judges from San Diego theaters will select "Festival Encores" for additional  performances Feb. 22-23. . . .  </P> <P> Teatro Mascara Magica is back at the Bowery Theatre's Kingston Playhouse to  present a one-act play, "Cronica de Un Secuestro" ("Chronicle of a Kidnapping")  by Argentine playwright Mario Diament on Mondays and Tuesdays. The show will be  presented in Spanish through Nov. 27, with an English reading to follow Dec.  3-4. . . .  </P> <P> The Gaslamp Quarter Theatre Company will present comic Don Victor in his new  show, "Yada Dada" Dec. 6-15, with a special signed performance for the  hearing-impaired Dec. 13.  </P></p>

			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Survey of Derbyshire (10): Special proposals - Derby, The City Challenge DERBY'S inner city deprivation indicators are depressingly familiar in a country straddled with poorly resourced industrial cities, big and small. Unemployment in the city is 12.5 per cent. In the two inner city wards of Litchurch and Babington, it was 30 per cent and 25.7 per cent respectively last July. It is expected to go higher. Absence of work, and low pay for those in work, are all too common in areas of late 20th century cities in Britain. Unemployment is highest among the ethnic minorities. Poor health is common. Two Derby wards with bad housing conditions and hygiene recently reported an outbreak of a strain of dysentery, for example. Most reported cases of tuberculosis in south Derbyshire are in Derby city. And, in the past year, there have been disturbing indicators of tensions building up between residents and the police in these districts. The worst-affected areas are in the south-east of the city, in Normanton and Osmaston. They are part of the area which is the target of the city's successful bid to the government for the second round of City Challenge funds. Derby officials believe that while their inner city problems are common, their proposals to improve this part of the city are special. The area is sliced into three triangular shapes by two main railway lines and the River Derwent. The residential population of about 26,000 is adjacent, but separated by railway tracks from the eastern part of the city, where some 250 acres of land lie derelict. The plan is that this acreage, plus another 50 acres, will be prepared in readiness for development. The site so created will be the focus of city and business efforts to generate new business and leisure ventures in the city. At the same time, special plans are in preparation to meet the social, educational, language and training needs of the inner city residents on the other side of the tracks, so they will be able to take advantage of jobs in the re-developed area. City Challenge money offers the pump-priming. A new company, Derby Pride, has been set up by the partners in Derby City Challenge to carry out the proposed programmes. City Challenge and Derby Pride are chaired by Mr Nigel Rudd, who heads the Williams Holdings conglomerate. The vice-chairman of City Challenge is Mr Nick Brown, leader of Derby City Council. Mr David Dawson, chief executive of Rolls-Royce's nuclear division, will head the City Challenge executive management from next January. The city business forum proposed two years ago never progressed. Much of the groundwork, however, found a ready vehicle in the City Challenge format where government requires that the public and private sectors work in partnership with the community. The attention now to be paid to the inner city will also, it is hoped, divert some of the private sector's preference for outer city developments, which was stimulated by the Toyota plant, eight miles south-west of the city. The owners of the inner city site are mostly British Rail Property Board, Brel and British Gas. Derby is not plumping for a single developer of the site, as preferred in some cities. Instead, it plans to use a number of local developers, who will be responsible for bringing in the end-users. The site will be broken up into several smaller sites. The marketability of the site will be much improved by the proposed spine road, which will ensure better access into the area from the big road networks around the city. Specific plans for the site include the relocation of Derby County Football Club to a new all-seater stadium, the National Ice Training Centre, for which Derby has been shortlisted, offices, an arts and media centre, and three new faculty buildings for the new Derby University. Student accommodation, and housing, is also mooted. The promotion of links between the university and business in planning new employment activities to the benefit of the inner city area will be stressed from the outset. Plans for the Normanton and Osmaston residential areas will focus on the rehabilitation of housing - about 70 per cent is owner-occupied or privately rented - using a variety of funding channels. Space for the community to meet the police will be provided at one of the neighbourhood police stations. A new managed workspace centre in the heart of the area will create jobs. All of these schemes, large and small, will use relatively small amounts of public money - City Challenge funds total Pounds 37.5m over five years - to attract a total spend of Pounds 212m. Some Pounds 36m will be from other public funds, for example, from the Housing Corporation, City Grant, and from the voluntary sector. But the bulk must come from the private sector. This is why City Challenge has to be a thoroughly well-planned and managed operation from the start. Derby believes it is well on the road.</p>

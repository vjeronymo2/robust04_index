			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Provisions of This Proposed Notice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OHTA concluded that there are insufficient data to determine the clinical utility of electrostimulation, to evaluate its long-term clinical effectiveness, and to identify xerostomia patients who would benefit from this procedure and that electrostimulation is not widely accepted as an effective treatment for xerostomia. Based on these conclusions, we have determined that electrostimulation of salivary glands and the electrostimulation device, the Salitron System, do not meet our criteria for effectiveness. Therefore, we propose to publish a final notice announcing a national coverage decision that Medicare does not cover electrostimulation of salivary glands for treating xerostomia secondary to Sjogren's syndrome.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The provisions of this notice would not affect any existing Medicare regulations. However, they would be incorporated in the Medicare Coverage Issues Manual (HCFA Pub. 6).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Response to Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because of the large number of items of correspondence we normally receive on proposed notices, we are not able to acknowledge or respond to them individually. We will consider all comments that we receive by the date and time specified in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> DATES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  section of this preamble, and if we proceed with a subsequent document, we will respond to the comments in the preamble to that document.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Collection of Information Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This document does not impose information collection and recordkeeping requirements. Consequently, it need not be reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under the authority of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Regulatory Impact Statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Introduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Currently, Medicare does not have a national policy for covering electrostimulation of salivary production for treating xerostomia secondary to Sjogren's syndrome. Medicare carriers have authority to make coverage decisions within the parameters set by the statute, regulations, and program instructions. Because this service is not ordered often and because of the low total allowed charges by Medicare Part B for this service, less than $26,000 in calendar year (CY) 1991, and no reported payments in CY 1992, we believe this proposed notice would result in negligible savings during calendar years 1994 through 1998.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612) unless the Secretary certifies that a notice would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA, all physicians prescribing and suppliers distributing a device to stimulate salivary production from existing glandular tissue are considered to be small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a notice may have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. This analysis must conform to the provisions of section 603 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital as a hospital that is located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has fewer than 50 beds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Medicare program paid for 41 electrostimulation devices during CY 1991 totaling an estimated $26,000 at an average cost of approximately $630 each. It appears that carriers are no longer paying for this electrostimulation device, thereby explaining why no invoices for this device were processed in CY 1992. In the absence of this notice, it is possible that the number of devices prescribed by physicians would increase and carriers would resume payment. Physicians have at least two alternate methods for treating xerostomia. One method is to rely on the use of artificial saliva in conjunction with the sipping of liquids for moisture. The second alternative is the use of gums and candies to induce saliva. Since there are alternative treatment methods, we believe this proposed notice would affect physicians and beneficiaries minimally.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, we are not preparing analyses for either the RFA or section 1102(b) of the Act since we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this proposed notice would not result in a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities and would not have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

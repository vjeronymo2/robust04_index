			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Bid talk lifts TSB to record ANOTHER wave of takeover speculation drove TSB shares to a record high yesterday as dealers reported exceptionally heavy turnover in both the stockmarket and the options market, where it was the fourth heaviest traded stock. At the close, TSB shares were 7 higher at 177p with turnover of 15m among the highest daily totals recorded in the stock since its October 1986 market debut. Yesterday's market rumours suggested a number of potential predators for the bank. Lloyds, always mentioned as a potential bidder when takeover stories develop in the bank sector, was seen as a possible bidder, as was Credit Lyonnais, the French bank and Germany's Commerzbank. Bayerische Vereinsbank was also mentioned. While not dismissing takeover possibilities, many bank specialists viewed the stories with suspicion. 'TSB is a recovery stock but the short term outlook remains poor,' said one. Another suspected that much of the recent interest represented little more than income funds buying for the dividend; the stock goes ex the 3.25p dividend on February 15. ICI adrift US drug pricing worries and technical factors combined to depress ICI shares, which were also hit by an element of profit-taking following a rise of more than 100p since Christmas. They closed a net 16 off at 1134p. Initially analysts said US investment bank Goldman Sachs was trying to sell 4m ICI shares as part of a big programme trade. Goldman was unavailable for comment. Later, there was a reaction to reports that a US congressional hearing was expected to list ICI as one of seven drug companies that have broken public promises to hold price increases below the rate of inflation in 1992. However, ICI's US pharmaceuticals unit said yesterday that it would limit 1993 price increases on all of its products to a maximum of 4 per cent. Some UK sector specialists were surprised at the strong performance of Glaxo in the light of the US worries. However, the recent shift in currency had left the New York equivalent of the shares worth about 635p on Tuesday night and the relative cheapness prompted very heavy US buying. Glaxo rose 10 to 665p with heavy turnover of 10m shares. Hanson sought Conglomerate Hanson moved forward 5 1/2 to 262 1/2 p on exceptionally heavy volume of 14m shares, with one international equities dealer arguing that the stock had broken through a barrier and would now have a clear run to 270p. US analysts like the company for its yield and some UK houses, including Natwest Securities, prefer the group to rival BTR. Many believe that the diminishing attractions of a large cash pile at a time of low interest rates makes it very likely that Hanson will do something with its famed Pounds 8bn 'war chest' within the next month or so. BTR, which is viewed as a prime rights issue candidate, was marked up sharply at the close as a sizeable buyer entered the market. The shares ended the day 14 higher at 566p. Retail tax worry Press comment on the possibility of VAT being levied on foodstuffs in the UK kept food retailers under a cloud. While many analysts believe the move to be too politically sensitive, and also the worst alternative to taxing such items as books and children's clothes, the possibility has not been entirely dismissed  - as yesterday's underperformances showed. Among the fallers, Argyll Group lost 5 to 383p, J Sainsbury 4 to 578p and Tesco 4 to 257p. Food manufacturers fared little better as a heavy tome from Nomura advised investors to go underweight in the sector in the wake of imminent margin pressure. Only Unilever escaped the house's negative stance, the shares advancing 17 to 1148p. Bucking the trend were Booker which lifted 12 to 433p as Kleinwort Benson reaffirmed its positive stance, Tate and Lyle, up 8 to 414p as UBS Phillips and Drew said buy and Unigate, ahead 9 at 325p on speculative buying. Bank shares continued their recent outstanding performance, with the FT Actuaries banks sector up 2.9 per cent compared with the Footsie 100's 1.4 per cent gain. The prospect of further cuts in interest rates, recovery in the UK economy and an end to free banking were said to have driven the sector higher, although some analysts warned that prices had run too far too fast. 'There is a genuine worry that once the results season is over the shares will disappoint,' said another analyst. The weakness of sterling was behind the strong rise in HSBC, which rose 19 to 577p. Barclays added 20 to 459p, Lloyds recovered from an uneasy opening to close 6 better at 560p and NatWest jumped 19 to 581p. Royal Bank of Scotland edged up 4 to 249p, still responding to the recent visit by analysts to the group's Direct Line insurance operation. Reports of an imminent flotation of the business were viewed as wide of the mark. The absence of much-rumoured rights issues saw composite insurances race ahead with the sector index moving up 3.4 per cent. Commercial Union, the only composite expected to record a profit for 1992, jumped 17 to 624p. Sun Alliance added 14 to 346p. Speciality chemicals group Laporte fell 5 to 649p ahead of an announcement that it had gained 78.3 per cent of glue manufacturer Evode and its recommended offer for the company was unconditional. Evode shares were a penny weaker at 133p. In a buoyant drinks sector, Guinness surged 18 to 475p helped by the rumour that France was to leave the ERM. The group has a 24 per cent cross-holding in the French luxury goods company LVMH. UK interest rate cut hopes aided Bass and Whitbread, which jumped 14 to 604p and 11 to 467p respectively. Grand Metropolitan rose 5 to 440p as Kleinwort Benson reiterated its buy stance. Rank Organisation shrugged off worries over the new accounting procedures and added 12 at 720p. Presentations to institutions in Scotland helped Thorn EMI gain 19 to 844p. A large line of stock overhung Ladbroke most of the day and the shares closed 2 adrift at 203p. Shares in British Aerospace moved sharply ahead after a tentative start on speculation that the company was about to announce an order for Hawk jets from Oman. Early weakness in BAe was due to the financial collapse of Dutch commercial vehicle maker DAF in which it holds a 16 per cent stake. Having shaken off the early gloom, sentiment was further lifted by the return of talk in some circles that GEC would launch a bid for BAe. Shares in BAe closed 13 up at 287p in trade of 6.5m, while GEC moved 9 ahead to 301p with volume reaching 11m. Truck maker ERF Holdings was seen as a beneficiary of the demise of DAF and the shares jumped 26 to 231p. Specialist engineer Trinity Holdings which came to the market in October 1992 at 120p, was also said to be another beneficiary of the collapse. The shares gained 11 to to 183p. Triplex Lloyd eased 2 to 171p, after the company announced a Pounds 17.3m rights issue. United Newspapers lifted 6 to 529p as SG Warburg reaffirmed its positive view, believing the worries over a VAT charge being imposed on newspapers has been discounted and that United will be helped by its US exposure. Reuters Holdings to benefit from a Goldman Sachs recommendation. The shares recovered 23 to 1427p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992/93 NEW HIGHS (355).

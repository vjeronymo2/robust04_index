			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: PITINO RELEASED FROM KNICKS' CONTRACT, EXPECTED TO TAKE KENTUCKY JOB  </P> <P> Rick Pitino was released from his contract as coach of the New York Knicks  Tuesday, freeing him to become basketball coach at the University of Kentucky,  which is on three-year NCAA probation.  </P> <P> "I'm a college basketball coach and I think that's where my heart is," Pitino,  36, said at a news conference outside Madison Square Garden after a meeting  with Knicks officials. "And I think that's in the best interest of everyone."  </P> <P> Pitino ended his two-year association with the NBA team by reaching agreement  on terms for the termination of his contract, the Knicks said. Those terms were  not released.  </P> <P> Pitino is expected to be selected as head coach at Kentucky this week. He was  offered the job last week by Wildcats athletic director C.M. Newton.  </P> <P> Asked if his negotiations with the Knicks were a bargaining ploy, Pitino said:  "No, that wasn't the intent of the meeting. The decision was made to go to  Kentucky yesterday."  </P> <P> Pitino reportedly was not getting along with Knick General Manager Al Bianchi,  the man who hired him away from Providence College.  </P> <P> "There is no dispute and there hasn't been a dispute in two years with Al  Bianchi," Pitino said.  </P> <P> Bianchi said he was not upset by Pitino's decision.  </P> <P> "No, why should I be mad?" Bianchi said. "Since after his first year here, Rick  and I have had conversations about professional versus college basketball. I've  known all along where his heart was."  </P> <P> Pitino led Providence to the 1987 Final Four. He won't be able to take the  Wildcats there for the next two years because the Wildcats will be barred from  postseason play.  </P> <P> Among the candidates to succeed Pitino are Dallas Maverick Coach John McLeod,  North Carolina State Coach Jim Valvano, Atlanta Hawk Coach Mike Fratello, Dick  Motta, the man McLeod replaced in Dallas, and Chicago Bull assistant Phil  Jackson, a former Knick player.  </P></p>

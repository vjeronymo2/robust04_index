			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Dispatches: Upriver in Sarawak The headman wanted a translation. 'It's the eyes. Just watch. She never blinks.' Satellite TV is illegal in Malaysia. But the more remote you are the more the outside world intrudes. Here, in the centre of Borneo, sitting in a tribal longhouse with shrunken heads hanging on the wall, surrounded by dense jungle, headman Long Lihan and I watch American TV news. Long Lihan has tattoos on his feet, legs and arms. His mighty ears have big gaps pierced in them. His face is like a collapsed football, wrinkled, toothless and warm. He peers at the screen. 'What strange people. Do they take drugs?' Long Lihan's longhouse is 500km upriver from Sarawak's coast. At Sibu, near Sarawak's coast, I'd climbed on board the Wah Wah. It was more a torpedo than a boat. With engines kicking out 700-horsepower the Wah Wah sliced its way up the Rejang river for five hours. An on-board video showed a programme on how to take care of office plants. I tried to read The Field Book of a Jungle-Wallah, written nearly a century ago by a senior official of the Brookes, the White Rajahs of Borneo. Journeys were more peaceful in those days. 'On a sandy point, a 100 yards or so away, my Chinaman is conjuring back into life last night's fire . . . around me I hear the cry of awakened beasts, the whistles and calls of many birds, the high treble of insects, many varying voices.' The only sounds I hear are talk of bio-feed for the potted plants and the roar of Wah Wah's engines. But there had been plenty of excitement along the way. Journalists are not very welcome in Sarawak. The state feels too many negative articles have been written about the logging industry and the depletion of the tropical rain forests. Officials have become incensed as foreign environmentalists have taken up the cause of jungle dwellers protesting about the destruction of their homelands. Outside the hotel in Kuching, Sarawak's capital, there was a whirring of film. A rather inept special branch man was whistling nonchalantly round, taking pictures behind his back. His camera must have been made from rejected East German tractor parts. I think he got a good shot of my socks. At the hotel in Sibu a Canadian psychiatrist insisted that I should consider treatment. I should monitor my behaviour. We travelled upriver together. The whole time, she talked about the Yukon. The rule of the Brookes went little further than Belaga, a town of about 2,000 on the upper reaches of the Rejang river. From here I needed to charter a boat to get into longhouse country. Upriver people drink a lot. A deal was done over glasses of 'Brandi Coke' (Crocodile brand), a paint-removing liquid sold at the local store. Four more hours upriver. We stop at one longhouse. It is more than 200 metres long. Some 550 people live here, consisting of 92 families. There is more drinking, this time of tuak, the local rice wine, poured out of what looks like a petrol tin. 'We must go to see Long Lihan,' says the boatman. 'It is only a few minutes upriver, over the rapids.' I choke on the tuak. 'Do you really think we should . . . perhaps I had better stay here?' No. Not to see the headman would be a serious insult. There is no choice. Soaked and mildly sozzled, I clamber into the longboat. We leap the rapids and cross whirlpools. The engine roars and stutters. The rain lashes down. Then, around a river bend, peering ridiculously through the pitch dark night, there is a set of fairy lights. Long Lihan's house. A kingdom all on its own. He has his own generator - and satellite dish. I loose my balance clambering up a river bank log. The headman nods a casual greeting at this mud-caked stranger and makes a place in front of his TV. We watch the US weather forecast. At some point I pass out on the floor. We leave in the morning. Long Lihan is in front of the screen, mesmerised. 'She still hasn't blinked,' he says.</p>

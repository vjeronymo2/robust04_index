			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Tokyo bank plans rescue of loss-making broker BANK of Tokyo is to mount a rescue operation, including capital and staff injections, for Dainana Securities, the loss-making broker, Reuter reports from Tokyo. Mr Yoshiaki Ara, a former BoT official and currently managing director of Sanyo Securities, is to become president of Dainana. Under the plan, Dainana will increase its capital - presently Y2bn (Dollars 15.78m) - through an issue of shares to a third party. Dainana wants the Bank of Tokyo to send staff to the brokerage and accept new shares. The broker, in which Bank of Tokyo is already a shareholder, posted a current loss of Y2.31bn for the year ended March 1992. Industry sources said Bank of Tokyo's support for Dainana was unlikely to turn into an acquisition or a merger, although Japan is moving to allow banks to buy a financially-troubled brokerage house in line with reforms of its domestic financial system. Ministry of Finance sources said it would accept a merger between a bank and an ailing brokerage house case by case after Japan lowered barriers between the banking and securities industry, which is expected in 1993. Lake, an unlisted Osaka-based consumer credit company, reported a parent net loss of Y71.9bn in the year to end-March 1992, against a Y10.5bn profit a year earlier.</p>

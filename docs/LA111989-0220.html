			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANTI-ABORTION GROUP MARCHES AT CLINIC;  </P> <P> PROTEST: PREGNANT WOMEN ENTER THE FACILITY, PASSING PROTESTERS OFFERING HELP,  INCLUDING ADOPTION SERVICES.  </P> <P> Graphic anti-abortion posters carried by protesters outside a health clinic  Saturday belied the gentle messages that some of the more than 200 participants  quietly voiced to pregnant women coming and going during the demonstration.  </P> <P> "If you ever need any help, or if any of the gals you know ever need anything,  you give us a call," said Rick, a sidewalk counselor for Operation Rescue (who  withheld his surname), speaking in soft, earnest tones to a young woman as she  was leaving the Family Planning Associates facility. He said that although the  woman said she wasn't pregnant, he wanted to let her know that if she was, the  group could offer whatever she needed -- a temporary home, medical care,  counseling, parents to adopt her baby -- if she chose not to have an abortion.  </P> <P> The demonstration was one of eight in Southern California to show solidarity  with the D.C. Project, a three-day political and informational workshop for  anti-abortion adherents in Washington.  </P> <P> "There are people with homes who will take in a girl with an unwanted  pregnancy, and they'll help her get on her feet again," said Le Ann John, a  spokeswoman for Operation Rescue in Orange County. John was one of two  spokesmen for the group on Saturday. "Right here, there are people who would  adopt right now -- I'd take one (baby) in a minute."  </P> <P> Father Leo John Celano, a teacher at St. Michael's Abbey in El Toro and the  other official spokesperson for the group, said those picketing had been called  upon by God to help prevent abortions.  </P> <P> "We have actually been impelled by the Holy Spirit to join in solidarity to  save the slaughter of the innocents. . . . These are crimes against humanity,  and that's why we're here: to rescue those children who are being dragged to  the slaughter."  </P> <P> Celano led the group in prayer and blessings throughout the five hours of  picketing, while other leaders of the group initiated prayer-like chants such  as "Shut the Door, Keep Out the Devil." A few guitarists strummed as group  members sang "Amazing Grace" and other songs.  </P> <P> About 30 women entered the health facility on Chapman Avenue. Most were with  boyfriends and few seemed interested in the Operation Rescue pickets. Some  women whisked their cars into the driveway to avoid waiting pickets, while  others accepted the handout literature and continued to their appointments.  About eight Family Planning Associates security guards and two Orange police  officers helped to escort a few of the more intimidated visitors.  </P> <P> Spokesmen for the facility on Saturday refused to comment on anything else  relating to the event.  </P> <P> Jan Cady, a spokeswoman for the National Organization for Women in Orange  County, said the Orange County Pro-Choice Coalition chose not to counter the  pickets.  </P> <P> "We feel that Operation Rescue hasn't really accomplished anything since its  inception in California -- except to cost the taxpayers a lot of money," Cady  said.  </P> <P> A 17-year-old Mission Viejo High School senior named Dave (who asked to  withhold his surname) was smoking a cigarette outside while he waited for his  15-year-old girlfriend to have her abortion. The two have dated for about six  months without using birth control, but Dave said that from now on, they would.  </P> <P> "At least they're not violent or nothing," he said about the picketers. He said  they were told that a group would be outside the facility the day his  girlfriend was scheduled to have her abortion, and it worried them. "I didn't  expect to see this many. . . . It's what she was afraid of most -- these  people."  </P> <P> A 20-year-old woman, who had just had an abortion and asked not to be  identified, had tears in her eyes as she walked with her friends to their car.  "They have no business telling anybody what to do with their lives," she said.  "I think they can do a lot better things with their lives than aggravate people  like this."  </P></p>

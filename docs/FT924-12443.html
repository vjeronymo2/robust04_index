			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Brasilia sell-offs to exclude'strategic groups' THE new Brazilian government is planning a radical overhaul of its privatisation programme, recasting it as a more nationalistic policy which excludes many so-called 'strategic companies'. Mr Antonio Barros de Castro, the new head of the programme, made clear in an interview with the Financial Times that, in the medium and long term, the programme would change considerably from that initiated last year by former President Fernando Collor. Criticising the previous administration for being 'too concerned with selling everything at all costs and under equal rules', Mr de Castro strongly defended the thesis that sectors such as telecommunications, oil and mining remained under state control. 'I don't see any convincing reasons why companies like Vale do Rio Doce (the state mining company), Telebras and Petrobras should go. Not only are these companies successful but our economy is still in formation and must pass through many important structural changes in which these companies have an important role.' The traditional aspect of these companies was important. 'To think of privatising Petrobras would be a cultural violation.' Mr de Castro's views contrast sharply with those of his predecessor, Mr Eduardo Modiano, who believed that Brazil should privatise all its state sector and who fought riots and numerous legal challenges to get the programme under way in September last year. Privatisation is the most sensitive issue facing the administration of Acting President Itamar Franco who took office nearly three weeks ago following Mr Collor's suspension. The team contains many past critics of privatisation, including Mr Franco himself, and fears of a slowdown of the programme have caused the main Sao Paulo stock market index to fall 10.9 per cent. The Franco administration has been eager to reassure investors that the programme will not be halted and that the next 10 sell-offs already scheduled will be maintained. Tomorrow Acesita, a big steel company, will go on sale. However, sweeping changes are planned for all sales after March. Mr de Castro's main pre-occupation is to end what he calls 'precipitous universality,' that is, applying the same conditions to all sell-offs. 'How can it be right for Goiasfertil, a non-viable fertiliser company, to be sold under the same rules as Embraer (the aerospace group), the nerve of Brazilian technology?' New legislation is being prepared to go before Congress to introduce three or four general company categories, each of which will have different rules for the limit on foreign capital (currently 40 per cent) and the type of currencies qualified to bid. This will not outlaw the use of controversial 'rotten currency' - unserviced debt of some state entities used in the programme to date. But a certain proportion of cash will be insisted on which could vary from 10 per cent to 'much higher than 40, though never 100'. Some 'exceptional' companies would be subject to special rules agreed with Congress; one such is Embraer. Mr de Castro said he would like to have included in this the National Steel Company (CSN) which is scheduled for sale in December, but 'I'd rather sell something I consider wrong than break our promise of not changing the rules of sales already agreed'.</p>

			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / UK Company News: QS continues progress with Pounds 2.22m QS Holdings, the discount clothing retailer, continued the progress made in the second half of 1993 as it reported a 25 per cent increase in profits in the six months to July 29. Profits at Pounds 2.22m pre-tax, against last time's low Pounds 1.68m, were struck on turnover ahead 17 per cent at Pounds 28.7m (Pounds 24.7m). The interim dividend is held at 1.56p from earnings per share of 3.43p (2.79p). Last time's payment was also maintained in spite of a profits fall. Yesterday the shares eased 3p to 170p. There was no price inflation in the profits increase. There was no profits rise for continuing stores partly because the group does not count stores closed and then reopened in a different location. During the period QS opened its 100th store - in Bristol - and by July 31 had 101 shops. In the six months the sales area increased by 7.5 per cent to 233,540 sq ft with the new stores in Luton, Bedford, Weston-super-Mare and Bristol. Already the group has exceeded its target of adding a further 10 per cent of selling space in the year. So far it has added 12 per cent with stores in Harrow, Lowestoft, an extension in Croydon and the relocation to larger premises in Fareham. Net cash stood at Pounds 5.7m, unchanged from the January 28 amount, as were stock levels. Interest receivable fell to Pounds 133,000 (Pounds 254,000). Other operating income doubled to Pounds 126,000.</p>

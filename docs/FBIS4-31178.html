			<p>BFN     [Text] Zhan Videnov has been reelected chairman of the  Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] Supreme Council. According to  the Election Commission, 688 delegates voted. Some 640  supported Videnov. The delegates in the congress hall greeted  this report with applause. Some 47 delegates voted against  Videnov and one abstained. The results of the All-Party Control  Commission election are expected in about 30 minutes.    Four prominent socialist deputies of the Alliance for Social  Democracy failed to gain the minimum required votes -- 50  percent plus one vote -- which is a condition for entering the  BSP Supreme Council. Dimitur Yonchev, Velislava Dureva, Rosen  Karadimov, and Elena Poptomova were not elected by the delegates  who voted for the supreme party organ membership. Andrey  Lukanov also failed in the election for membership in the BSP  Supreme Council.</p>

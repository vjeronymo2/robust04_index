			<p><P> September 18, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> SANTA PAULA SCHOOLS BATTLE IMAGE ISSUE;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: PARENTS BLAME AN ENROLLMENT EXODUS ON LOW TEST SCORES AND REPORTS OF  GANGS. EDUCATORS SAY THE CRITICISM IS UNDESERVED.  </P> <P> Santa Paula's 1950s-style neighborhood schools have vanished, and with them,  some of the students, parents and real estate brokers say.  </P> <P> In the Santa Paula Elementary School District, the city's largest, enrollment  fell 4% over a two-year period, according to district records. Today 3,164  students attend seven elementary and middle schools, compared with 3,290 three  years ago.  </P> <P> During the early part of the decade, Santa Paula schools filled with students  as enrollment increased nearly 1.8% a year.  </P> <P> Parents blame the exodus on low test scores, poor academic standards and  reports of gangs in the town's only middle school.  </P> <P> "We've had people move to Camarillo to avoid the schools," said Roylene  Cunningham, a parent and chairwoman of a school advisory committee.  </P> <P> School officials say the public schools' bad image is undeserved. They blame  slow municipal growth and an aging population for a smaller pool of students.  </P> <P> "There are parents in this community who are saying the schools are unfit,"  school board President Janet Grant said. "But I don't think that Santa Paula  schools deserve the reputation that they have."  </P> <P> Santa Paula Elementary School District Supt. Dave Philips has called for a  study on why students are leaving.  </P> <P> The district has tried to improve instruction by offering classes for gifted  Spanish-speaking students, as well as special literature and reading courses  for both English and Spanish speakers to help them learn in a bilingual  environment.  </P> <P> So far enrollment appears to be rising slightly compared with last year, but  officials fear further declines.  </P> <P> Falling enrollment would "affect personnel and mean reductions," Philips said.  "It makes things a little tighter."  </P> <P> Officials are restricting transfers to other Santa Paula school districts, a  move they say will keep a desegregation program intact. Elementary students  attend four districts in Santa Paula, including Santa Paula, Briggs, Mupu and  Santa Clara school districts.  </P> <P> The decline in enrollment has caused budget cuts, since state financing is  based on the number of students enrolled in the district. Over the past two  years, the district has lost about $437,000 in state money. Nine teachers were  laid off in July.  </P> <P> The exodus of students has also hurt the city, Santa Paula Mayor Kay Wilson  said.  </P> <P> Wilson, a real estate agent, said the decline has affected businesses and Santa  Paula's image as a good place to live.  </P> <P> Out-of-town buyers query real estate agents carefully, she said.  </P> <P> "We get asked two questions: 'Are your schools really as bad as we've heard?'  And 'How far is it to private school?' " Wilson said.  </P> <P> She said some buyers purchase residences in Santa Paula for its serene rural  environment, only to send their children to schools in Ventura and Camarillo.  </P> <P> One of those out-of-town buyers was Christine Quitmeyer, 35, a part-time  accountant at a dental office. For her, the Santa Paula elementary school  system was a lesson in disappointment.  </P> <P> Three years ago, Quitmeyer moved from Las Cruces, N.M., to Ventura County in  search of a quiet, rural atmosphere to raise her son, David. She settled on  Santa Paula after being impressed by the town's quaint tree-lined streets.  </P> <P> But after her son attended eighth grade at Isbell Middle School, Quitmeyer's  opinion changed.  </P> <P> "Kids would say they were in a different gang and could not play together. Half  the kids couldn't speak English," Quitmeyer said. She enrolled David in a  private Christian school.  </P> <P> The majority of non-English-speaking pupils is one reason Santa Paula students  have tested substantially lower in reading, writing and math than their peers  in other school districts, school officials say.  </P> <P> Latinos make up 72% of the elementary students in Santa Paula schools. Whites  make up less than 16% of the students.  </P> <P> Former school board member Bob Borrego, now a candidate for the Santa Paula  City Council, said test scores have always been low, because many students come  from poor farm worker and immigrant families and have limited education.  </P> <P> The school district has the second-highest concentration of migrant students in  the county. Fillmore has the largest.  </P> <P> "As far back as I can remember, people in the administration have been  lamenting low test scores," Borrego said.  </P> <P> In 1988-89, the last year for which figures were available, reading scores  dipped for the three grades tested under the California Assessment Program  compared with the previous year. Math scores also dipped for two grades the  same year.  </P> <P> It was the first decline for third-graders, whose reading scores had improved  slightly in previous years. For sixth- and eighth-graders, it was the second  time in four years that scores had dropped.  </P> <P> Past test scores had placed Santa Paula pupils in the lowest 2% in the state.  </P> <P> Scores in 1988-89 were affected by a major shake-up that changed boundaries and  transfers that involved 52% of the teaching staff, Philips said.  </P> <P> Aging school buildings, staff turnover and limited resources have brought  scores down in past years, Borrego said. He sat on a school board committee  that recommended changes that led to the many bitter complaints parents have  today.  </P> <P> Two years ago, neighborhood schools where students had attended up to the third  grade were changed to kindergarten through fifth grade. A separate middle  school at Isbell was created to handle sixth-, seventh- and eighth-graders.  </P> <P> The district also imposed a voluntary desegregation program that created magnet  schools that offered special academic programs, such as computer and science,  open classrooms and bilingual programs.  </P> <P> Magnet schools were supposed to help the district integrate schools by offering  special academic programs at schools where Spanish-speaking students made up  the majority. But it also angered parents.  </P> <P> "They look at the magnet schools as their great white hope," said Karen  Cottingham, 31, a parent and former president of the parent-teacher club at  Glen City School. "But I don't see people coming from across town to come to  Glen City to learn Spanish."  </P> <P> Parents say Isbell Middle School is plagued by rumors of gangs, fights and poor  instruction.  </P> <P> One Latino father, who asked not to be identified, said he preferred to have  his sixth-grade daughter go to St. Sebastian Catholic School rather than attend  Isbell.  </P> <P> "She was sort of afraid to go there because of the little stories that get out  about gang-related situations that had happened in the past," he said.  </P> <P> After meeting with Isbell teachers, the father said he was disappointed that  his daughter would have had to repeat material she had already learned.  </P> <P> Quitmeyer said she had the same complaint about the classes her son took at  Isbell.  </P> <P> "What they learned in seventh grade in New Mexico, they learned in eighth grade  here," she said.  </P> <P> Supt. Philips attributed some of the complaints to overambitious parents who  want their children to learn advanced material beyond their grade level. "There  are certain reasons where you might want to practice a skill a parent may see  as repetitive."  </P> <P> Aside from three minor scuffles at Isbell, there has been none of the violence  rumored about the school, Philips said. This year, enrollment has climbed by 41  students, he said.  </P> <P> Cathy Metelak, whose child attended private school for two years before  transferring to Isbell school, agreed with Philips' assessment. She said she  initially objected to sending her daughter to Isbell, where she was concerned  that her daughter would encounter gangs.  </P> <P> "It's been totally the opposite. She fits in very well and socially has no  problems. I talked to parents who have their kids in Ventura schools, and they  have the same problems we have."  </P> <P> Despite her criticism of the school system, Cunningham said her three children  have done well in the public schools.  </P> <P> "I feel like that's the real world," she said. "My husband went to a Catholic  school. I think he agrees with me that if our kids are going to get along in  this world, they need to live in this world."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Santa Paula School District Enrollment  </P> <P> Enrollment at 4th week of school  </P> <P> 1979-80/'81-82: 2,853  </P> <P> '87-88: 3,290  </P> <P> Source: Santa Paula Elem.

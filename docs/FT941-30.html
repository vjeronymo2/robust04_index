			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / International Capital Markets: Record domestic issue from China China will tomorrow launch an Dollars 11.5bn domestic bond issue - its biggest ever - to help cover the budget deficit and the increasing debt-service obligations of its vast infrastructure programme. Western bankers and economists say that plans to issue some Yn100bn (Dollars 11.5bn) in two and three-year bonds are highly ambitious and will severely test the Chinese debt markets. In the past, China has resorted to compulsory sales to individuals and institutions to clear a backlog. The authorities last year also outlawed the issue of competing debt issues such as enterprise bonds. China's budget deficit is forecast to reach Yn67bn this year, a big increase over last year. Total liabilities, including domestic and foreign debt service, are expected to amount to Yn129.6bn. China has already issued Yn15bn in six-month and 12-month Treasury bills to institutions this year. The 12-month paper is yielding just under 12 per cent, or about one percentage point more than the bank deposit rate. Chinese officials see this year's massive bond issue as soaking up surplus funds and aiding the fight against inflation. Among causes of continuing sharp rises in the cost of living is a consumer spending boom. China is also struggling to reduce money supply growth. The three-year bonds will carry an interest rate of 13.96 per cent. This compares with increases in the cost of living running at more than 20 per cent in the larger cities. Chinese investors have been reluctant to take up yuan-denominated bonds because of currency depreciation and worries about inflation. Beijing's first-ever public share offer has been heavily oversubscribed, the Beijing Evening News reported yesterday. Thousands queued for three days at more than 300 outlets to buy forms giving them the right to participate in a lottery for shares in four companies. The companies include Beijing Department Store and Beijing Light Bus Company.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with First Deputy Foreign Minister Valentin </F> Gatsinski by Plamen Tsvetkov; place and date not given: "The  Investigation Will Reveal the Truth"]    [Text] [Tsvetkov] Was the hijacking of the Khan Kubrat  vessel proven in the final analysis?    [[Gatsinski] The investigation will clarify the  circumstances under which the vessel left the Bulgarian section  of the Danube.    [Tsvetkov] Have any hijackers been identified?    [Gatsinski] The names of the crew members and the others on  board are known. The investigation will determine whether some  of them could be described in the way your question implies.    [Tsvetkov] Will the incident affect relations between  Bulgaria and Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro)?    [Gatsinski] Unfortunately, in contrast with their initially  declared readiness, the Serbian authorities did not cooperate in  returning not only the crew, but only the vessel's cargo.  Despite all this, I believe that after the comprehensive crisis  in Yugoslavia ends the new states that have emerged there will  find the place they deserve in Europe. I am convinced that in  the process of normalizing the status of Yugoslavia (Serbia and  Montenegro) in the international community our relations will  develop actively as good neighbors, on the basis of mutual  economic benefit.    [Tsvetkov] Would you like to forecast a new development, or  do you consider the case closed?    [Gatsinski] The case will be closed after the investigation  ends and the culprits are punished.</p>

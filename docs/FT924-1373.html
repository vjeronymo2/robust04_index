			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Arts: The Gift of the Gorgon - Theatre Peter Shaffer is author of some of the most celebrated plays of our time - The Royal Hunt of the Sun, Equus, Amadeus, Lettice and Lovage. These treat very different subjects, and his latest, The Gift of the Gorgon, differs from them all in that it is about a recently dead playwright, his wife and his adult son by another woman. The play begins with the news of Edward Damson's death. His widow Helen (Judi Dench) is in mourning, and his son Philip (Jeremy Northam), a scholar, pursues her in order to discover and record his father's story. At once we are in an absorbing nexus that feels quite new in Shaffer's output. The Damsons' marriage was one of muse and artist, whereas Philip is both a son who never knew his father and an academic enthusiast for his father's work. It is with the entry of the late Edward (Michael Pennington) that we recognise that this is actually a very Shaffer play after all. Shaffer relishes, on the one hand, dialectic, and, on the other, melodrama. The dialectic is between the rational and the irrational, the Apollonian and the Dionysiac: Salieri and Mozart, Miss Schoen and Lettice, and, here, the ordered Helen and the wild Edward. Though Helen calls herself Edward's muse, she is really his chief critic and editor. He is rebellious and adulterous. She sacrifices her life to his career; he accuses her of castrating him. Love turns to resentment. I enjoyed The Gift of the Gorgon on three of the most basic levels: I wanted to know what would happen next, I cherished several of its good lines, and I was riveted by Judi Dench. But once the dialectic-cum-melodrama combination became clear (during Act One), it began to feel formulaic. And not only is the playwright wild and melodramatic (he dances an ancient Greek dance in his bathtowel, pours red wine over his head and so on), but the whole play is also planned to prepare you for a lurid melodramatic climax: ie How He Died. As Helen unfolds her story, each act ends with a climax whose real importance we do not comprehend until Act Three. But oh] we know what's involved. The paper] The blade] The olive-green soap] These ingredients are so prominent in passing that we know they will return with a vengeance. Then, at the start of Act Three, Edward arrives, paler than before: 'I slept little last night.' Helen replies, warningly: 'And less tonight]' It is a credit to Dench that the audience does not guffaw. A niggling problem for the observer is the degree to which The Gift of the Gorgon means to be autobiographical. Like the Dionysiac characters in so many Shaffer plays, Edward is a florid theatrical conception, entertaining but not persuasive. And so one wonders unprofitably: why does Shaffer need to present such characters? Peter Hall directs, and shares responsibility for the play's flaws and virtues. Pennington is engagingly vivid as Edward, but he leaves us always aware of his virtuoso vocal technique. Northam's Philip is expert but deliberate. Only with Dench does art become transparent. Her playing blazes with truth and simplicity. She is both still and intense, detached and immersed. At the Pit until March 11</p>

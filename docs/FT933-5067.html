			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / A piece of the action for chess WHEN Nigel Short and Gary Kasparov sit down in London's Savoy Theatre tomorrow for the Chess World Championship there will be more than chess at stake. For the Pounds 1.7m match is not only proving to be one of the most colourful in recent history, but also the most commercial. With the contest now as controversial as the 1972 Spassky-Fischer world champion chess match, the promoters claim they have the making of a lucrative chess marathon. Up to 24,000 tickets will be on sale and a range of related promotions and match merchandise is planned. But since Short is the clear underdog - in spite of his training programme of swimming, weightlifting and computer analysis - the promoters still face problems in pitching chess as a spectator sport. The contest will be fought in 24 matches spread over two months. The winner is the one who gains more than 12 points, with a won match worth two points and a draw one point. Despite a barrage of publicity, by last weekend only three-quarters of the first week's tickets had been sold - even after some were reduced to Pounds 10 from earlier prices as high as Pounds 150. The promoters insist television coverage should boost audiences later. Channel 4, which has bought 'live' television rights, will show 60 hours of the match, using a panel of 'expert commentators' to fill in the pauses. Channel 4 said: 'It will be a format a bit like Test match cricket - the aim is to explain it to people who know nothing.' Even by the Byzantine standards of chess, the politics behind the contest's sponsorship have been bewildering. The battle started seven months ago when Fide, the international chess organisation, announced that Manchester would stage the match - a choice that seemed apt, given that Short, the 28-year-old bespectacled chess star who is Britain's first world champion chess challenger, is from nearby Bolton. But Kasparov's dislike for Fide and Short's disappointment with Manchester's Pounds 1.2m prize money led the players to reject the bid and form a rival chess group. Fide blacklisted the players and staged its own 'world championship', which started in Holland this weekend. Short and Kasparov reopened the bidding battle, which was won by The Times newspaper and the telecommunications company Teleworld, which offered Pounds 1.7m prize money, five-eigths of which goes to the winner. Meanwhile, the BBC seems uncertain if the game is a sport. It has enlisted Newsnight reporters Peter Snow and Francine Stock to host its coverage of the game - journalists better known for dissecting complex current affairs. Given events so far, it may be an appropriate choice.</p>

			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Forecast of Pounds 3bn rise in personal tax THE GOVERNMENT is expected to raise an additional Pounds 3bn from direct personal taxation in November's Budget, according to the Ernst &amp; Young Independent Treasury Economic Model. Item says the tax increase could be achieved by a rise in the ceiling for national insurance contributions but it believes Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, will rule out further indirect tax rises or increased company taxation for fear of damaging the UK's competitive economic position. Its study published today says the biggest problem facing Mr Clarke over the next few years is the transformation of the country's net overseas assets, worth Pounds 110bn in 1987, into net debts by next year.

			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / International Bonds: Europe benefits from heavy reallocation of US assets THE SPEED and scale of the shift out of the US Treasury market into European bond markets last week surprised many of the traders who had predicted such a move this year. 'There has been a massive reallocation of assets, in a very volatile market,' one trader said. A significant portion of the funds involved originated in the US: dealers said the first to make a move were the leveraged funds, which tend to be more speculative, followed by proprietary traders at banks, and finally, and in reasonably large volume, US mutual funds and insurance funds. The shift is perhaps more surprising, given that the dollar at last appears to have bounced out: during the last two weeks, the dollar has strengthened by around 10 pfennigs. However, traders believe many US investors have been switching the foreign exchange exposure of their European bond investments back into dollars. (In fact, this hedging activity may have been a factor in the strengthening of the dollar.) What the move does underscore is a strong view on the path of European interest rates compared with the US. The US bond market underwent a sharp correction over the past week or so, as investors decided to position themselves for ultimately higher US rates and for lower European rates at the next change in rates. Although the US market recovered somewhat at the end of last week - from what many traders felt was an oversold position - the strong wave of enthusiasm for US securities over Christmas and the New Year has waned. Having missed the strong rise at the end of the year, many traders became involved in what some term 'a lemming trade'. The heavy flow of new issues in the Eurodollar and the US corporate bond market has added to the strain, and forced Eurobond spreads to widen, even as the market fell. Some traders maintain the US will see another interest rate cut, and argue the current shift is not logical. Certainly, it does not seem to be based solely on economic fundamentals or trading technicalities and the recent volatility in prices seems to have left traders uncertain where value lies. The main beneficiaries of the move into European bonds have been the mainstream markets: first the German Bund market and then the French OAT market, and, to a lesser degree, the gilt market and the Dutch government bond market. The strength in the German and French markets also provided a fillip for the Ecu bond market, where there was aggressive buying of four to six-year bonds. The preference for this area of the yield curve reflects a view on falling interest rates, but also the recognition of a cheaper area of the yield curve, which had become quite inverted due to buying at the long end. THE FRENCH government is in talks with banks about an issue of 30-year Ecu bonds, under its Ecu OAT programme. Such an issue would substantially extend the Ecu yield curve, a gap which will also be filled by the UK's first auction of three-year Ecu Treasury notes this week. Rumours of the French plans had a negative impact on what currently constitutes the long end of the Ecu bond market - Italy's 20-year deal  - which fell around 40 basis points in price, on expectations of the supply. The French deal under discussion is expected to total Ecu1bn-Ecu2bn. The Treasury plans to control stripping of the bond to preserve as much liquidity as possible, by restricting stripping to market makers in the programme, market sources claim. 'Stripping' a bond involves reducing it to its component parts by selling each coupon separately, leaving a zero-coupon bond, so an investor can buy, for example, a piece of paper which pays interest once only, in 25 years' time.</p>

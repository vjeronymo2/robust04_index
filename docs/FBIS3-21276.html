			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The weekly AL-SHALL economic report criticized the  government's report concerning the economic situation in the  country and the government's inability to give accurate  statistics in good time. The report's text follows:  <H5>  Government's Report Concerning the Economic Situation </H5>   The government has submitted a report to the National  Assembly concerning economic conditions in the country,  describing developments of the situation with regard to public  finance, the oil sector, directions and changes of monetary  policy, the foreign trade sector, and the securities market. The  report went into structural problems that the Kuwaiti economy  faces and proposals to counter those issues, even though they  are within desirable limits in many of their directions. There  was tangible progress in the report, compared with previous  reports and statements by the government, in which there was  wariness concerning political reactions and a desire not to  publish recent or clearly defined numbers.    The government based its expectations for general revenue in  the draft 1993-94 budget on production levels of 1.8 million  barrels per day [bpd], at an average price per barrel of $14.  Oil revenue in the first half of the current fiscal year  (July-December 1993) was approximately 1.235 billion Kuwaiti  dinars [KD]. This means that it was a little higher than budget  estimates, if it were computed on the basis of an entire year.    However, the present crisis in the oil market has forced the  government to modify its estimates and compute oil revenues for  the rest of the year at a production rate of a million bpd, at  an average price of $10.50 per barrel. That is a healthy  direction.    The government estimates that if the current level of oil  prices continues, it will add 210 million more dinars to the  estimated budget deficit, which will total KD1.2 billion, if we  exclude the savings from income earmarked for future  generations' reserve.    The government estimates the deficit for half the fiscal  year  at KD820 million, as a result of its disbursing more than half  of the budget credits. Total remitted to the ministries,  agencies, and organizations was ID2.221 billion, an average of  KD370 million a month or about $1.2 billion. This is not a good  indicator since, usually, actual expenditures are less than  estimates. If disbursement rates continue as they are, they  could put pressure on future budget credits. The numbers put  forth by the government do not reflect the country's actual  financial position for a half year, nor the estimated position  for a full year. There is either a lack of comprehensiveness in  the draft budget or the government's estimates, because of  reduced revenue and expenditures outside of the budget.    The part pertaining to oil dealt with less than half of the  known developments in that sector, such as the rise in  production rates during 1993 from 1.5 million bpd to 2 million  barrels daily, after OPEC's recent agreement. There was also the  increase in refining capacity from 415,000 bpd to 580,000  barrels, following the resumption of operations of most of Ash  Shu'aybah's refinery units. The report confirms the initialling  of an agreement to establish a new petrochemical complex,  costing--by previous statements--about $2 billion. The important  matter is that the project will have foreign participation.    The report also dealt with the monetary and banking sector  and referred to the rise in private sector deposits with  commercial banks. However, it mentioned that most of the  increase was in deposits of foreign currencies, attributing that  to the banks' fear of accepting Kuwaiti dinar deposits, in view  of their expectations of a greater drop in interest rates for  the dinar, on the one hand, and because of the dearth of local  investment opportunities on the other. The increase in private  sector deposits totaled KD339 million. The deposits in foreign  currency were KD234 million, or 69 percent of the total. The  Central Bank believes that the lowering of interest rates and  activity of the Kuwaiti securities market contributed to the  9.7-percent increase in volume of credit incentives in November  1993 over December 1992. About 39 percent of those incentives  were personal.    In another matter, the report stated that the development of  foreign trade statistics lagged five months behind, since they  only cover the first seven months of 1993. This is  unjustifiable. Those statistics show a trade surplus of around  KD522 million, since the value of exports was KD1.678 billion,  while imports totaled KD1.156 billion. The latter number is  close to pre-invasion levels, because imports totaled KD1.146  billion for the first seven months in 1990.</p>

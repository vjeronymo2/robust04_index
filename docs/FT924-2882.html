			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / UK Company News: AB Engineering in red PROBLEMS AT its diesel power engineering business were behind the decline into losses of Pounds 46,000, against Pounds 42,000 profit, at Associated British Engineering in its first half to September 30. The group said that the Dawson-Keith subsidiary had been undergoing a reorganisation and in addition had suffered from the effects of exchange rates and an adverse sales mix. However, the order was now much improved and a good recovery was expected in the second half. Group sales in the first half were Pounds 17.2m (Pounds 16.2m) and operating expenses Pounds 17m (Pounds 16m). The directors forecast that, subject to unforeseen circumstances, the full-year would achieve a substantial imp-rovement over last time's Pounds 35,000.</p>

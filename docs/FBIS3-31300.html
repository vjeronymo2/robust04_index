			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Warsaw, 15 Feb--Poland is well prepared for military  cooperation with NATO, Field Marshal Richard Vincent, chairman  of the NATO military committee, said today after his meeting  with Piotr Kolodziejczyk, minister of national defense.    In a statement to the media, Vincent underscored that  "Poland  is an important and prospective partner" for the North Atlantic  Treaty. According to him, the issue of Partnership for Peace,  which was discussed during his meeting with the defense  minister, is neither a substitute issue nor an attempt to avoid  a direct response to the issue of Poland's membership in NATO.    In response to the question of whether NATO can make  technical data and information concerning air defense systems  available to Poland, Vincent said that all these issues are on  the list of priorities for implementation within the framework  of closer cooperation and bringing Poland closer to NATO. "We  want to understand each other better at the military level; we  want to create operational effectiveness for cooperation," the  field marshal added. The aforementioned air defense systems are  very important for Poland's security, but they are very  expensive.    Kolodziejczyk said that Vincent "is encouraging us to work  extensively on a review document, which we should start  negotiating in Brussels soon," to conclude a bilateral agreement  between Poland and NATO and to join the Partnership for Peace  program. According to Kolodziejczyk, bilateral cooperation  between Poland and the members of NATO is a "good start for the  implementation of the initiative."</p>

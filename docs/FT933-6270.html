			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / In the footprints of the Holocaust: Maurice Samuelson knew his grandfather came from the Polish village of Bolimow - but little else about it. When he visited it, he learned a lot more . . . ON SEEING the road sign, I got out of the car and posed with my wife for a photograph. We had finally reached Bolimow, the village in Poland from which my grandfather, Morris Jenkins, had come to England 100 years ago. He established a tailoring business in Manchester and fathered 10 children before dying, aged 46, in 1919. My mother, his second youngest child, was then eight years old. Although she remembered him only faintly, she never forgot the name of his birthplace. She once said she thought it was near Warsaw. But that was all she knew. In any case, Bolimow was always mentioned in the past tense, as though it was not of this world. We never thought of seeking it on a map. Nor did we ever think about how many generations of our family might have existed in that part of Poland, wherever it might be. Still less was it ever whispered that, until the second world war, we had numerous close relatives in Bolimow. It was to be nearly 50 years before I discovered that seven first cousins of my mother, all married with children of my own generation, were among the victims of the Nazis. They were the children of my great-aunt, Riva-Leah, and her husband, Mordechai Mann. Riva-Leah had died in 1929. Her elderly husband perished in the Holocaust. As far as I was concerned, these people might never have existed. While stunned by the German atrocities, my family had always assumed that, as English-born Jews, we were immune to its horrors. We recoiled from the first photographs of concentration camp victims and were uneasy whenever we encountered the jittery, wide-eyed survivors who appeared in England after the war. To reach Bolimow, we had driven about 60 kilometres south-west of Warsaw, across the farmland of the Mazovian plain, once a dense centre of Jewish population. At Sochaczew, once 75 per cent Jewish, we had photographed an impressive new Jewish memorial in a bare field which had been the community's cemetery. (The Roman Catholic cemetery lay next door, full of well-tended memorials). We had also visited the bigger Jewish cemetery in Lowicz, last resting place of great aunt Riva-Leah and her mother. The cemetery's imposing brick wall still screens it from the road and about a quarter of its headstones still stand. But its other walls have vanished, together with the rest of its stones. Driving the last kilometre into Bolimow, I realised that our ignorance of our origins was not as remarkable as it seemed. Our family was typical of those founded by poor Polish immigrants to Manchester at the end of the last century. Remembering my Jewish schoolfriends' families from the second world war, I wondered how many of them also had close relatives who were forgotten even before they were herded into the gas chambers . . . A grassy square, little bigger than a soccer pitch, appeared suddenly on the right. I drove round it and parked on the cobbles near a small bus shelter. With the help of Peter, the young Polish interpreter whom we had engaged in Warsaw, I wanted to question the locals about Bolimow and its Jewish ghosts. I was not entirely ignorant about the place. Situated on the Rawka, a narrow tributary of the river Bzura, Bolimow has a dubious footnote in history - the first place where poison gas was tried out on the battlefield. The Germans used it in the winter of 1915 against the Russian front line on the other bank of the Rawka. (Because of the icy cold, the gas did not disperse; it was soon used to deadlier effect on the western front). There had also been a large forest in this region, which was the haunt of the now extinct wild ox. I had learned about my Bolimow connections from Freda Etzioni, an Israeli cousin who was born in Bolimow and went to Palestine in 1934. She had trained in Poland as a nurse. Her first Israeli home was a kibbutz near the Sea of Galilee. When the second world war started, she moved to Jerusalem, where she eventually became the head nurse at the Hadassah hospital. From her and from Moshe Mann, another Bolimow cousin who settled in Palestine in 1932, I learnt that when the Germans marched in, there were about 50 Jewish families in the village - between 10 and 20 per cent of its population. Freda had drawn me a rough map of the centre of Bolimow, indicating the houses in the centre inhabited by our various relations. At first sight it seemed accurate, although the village green was not oval but rectangular (I later learnt that the lay-out was altered after the war). In the middle stood the well and hand pump, just as she had drawn them. But she had forgotten totally the white-towered church, only 200 metres away. All around stood single and two-storey dwellings, painted pink, brown or grey with tar-covered roofs. There were no traces of mezzuzot, the slim prayer cases affixed to the door-posts of most Jewish homes. But I knew that several of them had been my relatives' homes until the Nazis arrived at their doors. The only modern buildings were the two-storey, white-washed PKO bank and a shabby bar-cum-restaurant. Half a century after the war, I had scant hope of finding anyone who remembered my relatives or who could identify their houses, so I was not surprised by the blank expressions of the first elderly people we approached. We had a more promising reaction, though, from the young girl in the bar. 'Try Stefan Konopczynski, the potter,' she said. 'He knows all about the history of Bolimow.' I had already seen this name in the Polish guide-book I had brought from London. It contained three paragraphs about Bolimow, mentioning the two Romanesque churches and the Konopczynski pottery. The book was 30 years old and neither the churches nor the pottery were on my sight-seeing list. But the presence of such a significant old-timer was a good omen. At midday we arrived at the Konopczynski home, a solid brick house where a little girl was playing on the lawn. It was the potter's grand-daughter. Her mother came to the door and asked us to come back at 2.30. Stefan, now nearly 90, was having his daily rest. In the meantime, she told us how to find the Jewish graveyard and the residence of the parish priest. A soft August rain was falling but we decided to walk to the cemetery rather than drive. Passing a stone mason's yard, full of unfinished tombstones, we turned down a tree-lined path through a field and saw the walls of Bolimow's Catholic cemetery. Where was the Jewish cemetery? 'That's it,' Peter said, pointing to the flat, open field beyond the Catholic graveyard. As the sun came out, I approached the grassy field with sinking feelings. Where were my own forebears' graves? I wondered. Where were their headstones? Could they have been taken to the mason's yard and recycled for other people's memorials? The field was surrounded by a ditch and embankment. There was room in it for at least 100 graves. Stumbling over the rough ground, we found only seven fallen headstones, their weathered Hebrew letters peeping through the long grass and wild flowers. While my wife gathered flowers and grass as keepsakes, I photographed the scene. Then we returned in silence and walked through the village to the priest's house, opposite Bolimow's second church, by the river where cousin Freda had played as a child. It was now full of pollution. Father Ryszard Smoldar, a chubby, well-scrubbed man in his early 40s, received us warmly. Over coffee and chocolate-coated cinnamon cakes served by his housekeeper, he gave a strange explanation for the Jewish cemetery's desolate condition. 'The stones are all still there. But they have fallen down and are lying under the grass,' he said. He added that, following the opening of diplomatic relations between post-communist Poland and Israel, the village council was planning some kind of memorial to the Jews. The idea had been proposed by the Voivod, the larger administrative area in which Bolimow was situated. But as he had served at Bolimow for little more than a year, he was not briefed fully on the latest situation. Stefan Konopczynski was better informed, he said. Bidding us goodbye, Smoldar told us that the solid cream-and-brown police station we had passed in the centre of the village had been the synagogue before the war. Alert and refreshed, Stefan Konopczynski was waiting for us. He looked 20 years younger than his real age. With his black beret and trim white moustache, he seemed more like a Breton farmer than a Polish potter. We followed him to his pottery, a long shed in its own grounds where his son, Jan, a man in his early 40s, was working the wet clay. In a separate room stood shelves of white earthenware jugs decorated with simple but attractive patterns of doves and flowers. The pottery was well known in the district and Stefan showed isitors' book. But I was less excited by the pottery than what father and son were able to tell me about Bolimow. They were a remarkable repository of village history. While Stefan had devoted his life to collecting documents about it, Jan had written a doctoral thesis about its sociological development. As his potter's wheel whirred, Jan confirmed that the police station had been the synagogue before the war. But he discounted Smoldar's claim about the sunken Jewish gravestones. 'They were removed or stolen during or immediately after the war,' he said. He had sent the inscriptions on the seven surviving stones to be translated by the Jewish historical institute in Warsaw. It was his father, he said, who had persuaded the villagers not to grow crops on the Jewish cemetery or to graze their animals on it. Back in their living room, father and son showed us documents illustrating the presence of Jews in Bolimow for more than 300 years. These were annual returns of the local forest collective, the shareholders of which, regardless of religion, enjoyed the rights to timber from the local woodlands. Their contributions were used to pay for the village's amenities. Alongside their names and details of their annual payments, the shareholders had made their marks. The Christians signed with three crosses; the Jews had drawn three small circles. On the returns for 1820 and 1939 I found the name Mann, the surname of my mother's cousins and the largest Jewish family in Bolimow. 'I remember all the Jewish families,' said Stefan, mentioning five people who had been his friends. He fished out a 1907 group photograph of about 30 members of the village's volunteer fire brigade. On the reverse he had written all their names, Christians and Jews. He described two wartime events. Early in the war, he had been arrested by the Gestapo and taken to Lowicz, where the town's Jewish leaders were being tortured to extort money from the rest of the Jewish community. Once the ransom was paid, they were murdered, along with the others. In Bolimow, two families - 11 people - had hidden in a bunker that they had built and furnished near the river Rawka. They survived until 1944, when they were betrayed to the Nazis. Before being executed, they persuaded the Germans to spare a non-Jewish Polish soldier who had shared their hiding place. Their Christian neighbours took their bodies to the Jewish cemetery and buried them. Stefan said that the only local Jews to survive the war were four boys who had gone to Palestine when it ended. I drove back to Warsaw grateful to Stefan and Jan for their acts of remembrance. Three weeks later, we took our photographs and notes of the visit to Freda and Moshe in Israel. From the photographs, Moshe identified his own house and that of my great-aunt. They appeared unchanged, he said. After the war, Moshe had corresponded with his former school teacher in Bolimow and knew about the two families who had hidden by the river. One of them, the Shtiefermanns, were his own first cousins. He had also known the four boys who had lived through it all and reached Palestine after the war; their families still live in Tel Aviv. As for Stefan Konopczynski, Moshe's mother used to buy her crockery from him. Back in London, I turned to Martin Gilbert's Atlas of the Holocaust to discover the likely fate of the rest of the family - my mother's seven cousins, their elderly father, wives, husbands A ghetto was created in Bolimow on June 11 1940. In February or March 1941, its inhabitants were among 72,000 Jews from the district dispatched by road to Sochaczew, from where they were sent by rail to Warsaw. In the ghetto there, they either shared the fate of the 150,000 who died or fought, or were among the 350,000 sent from Warsaw to the Treblinka death camp. Had my mother still been alive, I wonder if I would have had the heart to tell her this story. But perhaps she had known some of it all along - and never had the heart to share it with me. At least my own children will know.</p>

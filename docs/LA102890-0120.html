			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MERYL STREEP  </P> <P> I fail to understand why it's someone else's responsibility to straighten out  Meryl Streep's salary inequity. It seems that she should be capable of handling  this problem herself.  </P> <P> Surely, there are like-minded men and women who will assist. Let's find and  confront the culprits responsible for this dastardly act.  </P> <P> But please, stop whining about the problem, and do something.  </P> <P> ROBERT FORRESTER  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P> <P> In the chronology of Streep's screen credits there was one omission that I'm  aware of, and I'm sure that Woody Allen would notice -- "Manhattan," although  it wasn't a pivotal role for Streep, I always think we should give ol' Woody  his due for the new interesting faces that he has introduces to the screen;  there have been so many.  </P> <P> JANE MCCONNELL  </P> <P> Manhattan Beach  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Valeriy Galitskiy, Aris Zakharov, and Aleksandr </F> Frenkel, Russian State Committee on Statistics: "Production  Output and Price Dynamics as of 8 February"]    [Text]  <H5>  Prices for Goods and Services </H5>   Over the period 1-8 February 1994 prices for consumer  goods and services rose by 3.3 percent, including those for  foodstuffs--by 3.8 percent, nonfood items--by 2.8 percent, and  for-fee services for the population--by 3.1 percent.    Indices of prices for consumer goods and services in  January-February were as follows (as a percentage of the  preceding date):                       01/25      01/31      02/08      Average daily price rise                                                     February      January   Consumer        103.4      102.4      103.3      0.42          0.68  goods and  services   including:   foodstuffs      103.8      102.4      103.8      0.45          0.68   nonfood items   102.2      102.3      102.8      0.36          0.40    for-fee         107.6      103.2      103.1      0.37          2.38  services for  the  population      Prices in the consumer market continue to rise at a faster  rate (4.4 percent) in the cities of the Far East. They rose the  least (by 1.8 percent) since the beginning of the month in the  cities in the Urals.  <H5>  Foodstuffs </H5>   From 1-8 February prices for basic foodstuffs rose by 3.9  percent in organized trade, and by 3.5 percent in nonorganized  trade. Price changes by main categories of food products over  this period are shown below (in % of 31 January 1994):                            Total           in organized        in nonorganized                                       trade               trade   All food products    103.8           103.9               103.5   including:   Meat and meat        103.3           103.4               103.0  products   Fish and fish        105.1           105.2               102.8  products   Milk and milk        108.7           109.1               106.8  products   Eggs                 102.1           102.1               102.0   Sugar                100.7           100.7               100.6   Bread and bakery     105.8           105.8  products   Cereals and          104.5           104.6               102.5  macaroni items   Vodka                101.2           101.1               101.9   Potatoes and         105.9           104.7               107.4  vegetables      Prices with respect to milk products and bread and bakery  products in organized trade continue to rise at a high rate.  Over January--beginning of February prices for these products  rose by 1 percent daily on average. Over the past week prices  for meat products and vegetables rose by almost 3 percent; the  rate of price increases with respect to eggs slowed down  somewhat (by 2 percent). Prices for sugar, confectionery items,  and tea also rose insignificantly (by 1-2 percent).    In nonorganized trade prices rose over this week on average  at almost the same rate as in organized trade. Prices for milk,  sour cream, beef, poultry meat, and vegetable products rose at a  higher rate (5-13 percent). Prices for pork, butter, vegetable  oil, eggs, and apples rose by no more than 2-3 percent.    The cost of a consumer basket of 19 basic foodstuffs rose  over the week by 4.2 percent and amounted as of 1 February to  39,100 rubles [R], calculated on a monthly basis. Magadan  remains the most expensive city (R94,900) and Ulyanovsk the  least expensive (R22,200). The price differential between them  measures a factor of 4.3. Moscow has moved from 35th to 29th  place of 132 monitored cities (R43,800 on a monthly basis).  <H5>  Nonfood Items </H5>   In the beginning of February prices for these items  continued  to rise at a moderate pace. Prices for sewn items and knitwear,  fabrics, tobacco items, and cultural and household goods  increased by 2.0-3.8 percent.  <H5>  For-Fee Services for the Population </H5>   Prices rose over the week by 3.1 percent. For some types of  consumer services, prices increased by 10-12 percent. The cost  of basic residential telephone service increased two- to  fourfold in 24 cities and amounted to R1,500-2,000 a month.  <H5>  The Consumer Market </H5>   The total volume of retail turnover and for-fee services (at  officially counted enterprises) amounted to R6.6 trillion in  January of this year and increased eightfold as compared to  January of last year. In comparable prices, it declined by 6.6  percent.    Retail turnover amounted to R5.9 trillion and  increased 7.8-fold in current prices as compared to last  January. The physical volume of goods sold decreased over this  period by 2.9 percent, and as compared to December--by more than  one-quarter.    The private sector share (including consumer cooperatives)  of  officially reporting enterprises accounts for 56 percent of the  retail turnover (38 percent in January 1993); the state  sector--for 37 percent (60 percent); and other nonstate forms of  ownership--7 percent (2 percent).    There were R3.1 trillion worth of foodstuffs sold to the  population in January of this year, which is eight times more  than over the same month last year in current prices, and 7.8  percent less in comparable prices.    In January 1994 the population purchased R2.8 trillion worth  of nonfood items (a sevenfold increase in current prices, and a  3.3 percent increase in comparable prices).    In January of this year R0.7 trillion worth of for-fee  services were rendered to the population (at officially counted  enterprises), which constitutes an 11-fold increase in current  prices as compared to last January, and a 48-percent decline in  comparable prices.    The share of household consumer services in the structure of  for-fee services is declining. In rural areas over the past year  the number of combination point-of-service facilities declined  by 12 percent. Professionally equipped barber facilities  remained in only one half of currently operating enterprises.  Only one-third of these facilities still provide electronics and  complex home appliances repair services; photo services--7  percent; and shoe repair--10 percent. Mobile services in rural  areas are being phased out.    Consumer goods and services sold to the population in  January  of this year through all sales channels amounted to about R13  trillion[.sup]*[/], which exceeds that for last January by a  factor of 8.5 in current prices, and by 1.3 percent in  comparable prices.  <H5>  Inventories of Goods </H5>   As of 1 February of this year the value of current  inventories of consumer goods in trade and industry of the  Russian Federation amounted to R9.2 trillion (at officially  reporting enterprises). As compared to 1 February of last year,  their volume declined by 4 percent in comparable prices. About  79 percent of inventories (R7.2 trillion worth) are concentrated  at retail trade enterprises.    Below are data characterizing turnover sufficiency level in  terms of inventories of goods:                         Inventories of goods in retail trade    Turnover                    network                                 sufficiency in                                                            terms of                                                            inventories (in                                                            days of trading)                     billion rubles   as % of the                                     corresponding date                                     last year (in                                     comparable prices)   As of 1           926.9            78                     43  February 1993   As of 1 January   6,737.6          85                     36  1994   As of 1           7,221.3          97                     47  February 1994      As compared to January 1993, inventory sufficiency in  January  of this year was higher with respect to canned meat and fish,  margarine and margarine products, sugar, confectionery items,  tea, salt, woolen fabrics, clothing and underwear, knitwear and  hosiery, footwear, synthetic detergents, radio receivers,  refrigerators, and tobacco items.  <H5>  Market Saturation With Consumer Goods </H5>   In January of this year saturation of all retail trade  channels with consumer goods increased as compared to last  January by 23 percent, and as compared to December by 4 percent.    Below are data characterizing the changes in the consumer  market saturation by individual groups of goods (in percentages):                        Saturation coefficient[.sup]*[/]    Saturation                                                      index[.sup]**[/] in                                                      January 1994 as                                                      compared to                    January    December    January    01/93       12/93                   1993       1993        1994   Total            59         76          87         123         104   including:   foodstuffs       60         72          83         119         107   of them:   meat products    75         83          84         109         94   milk products    56         68          75         121         104   butter           89         99          98         110         99   vegetable oil    85         96          94         111         98   eggs             97         97          97         100         100   granulated       83         99          98         118         99  sugar   confectionery    81         91          91         112         100  items   tea              83         97          92         111         95   nonfood items    73         86          94         130         112   of them:   sewn items       70         85          91         130         120   knitwear         67         87          88         131         101   hosiery          87         97          96         110         99   leather          69         86          85         123         99  footwear   refrigerators    46         78          83         180         106   color            65         84          80         123         95  television  sets   [.sup]*[/] Ratio of the number of cities where on the day of registration  the goods were available for sale to the total number of surveyed cities  (132).

As the consumer market develops and new channels for selling  goods appear, part of the population is shifting from organized  to nonorganized trade in regard to goods purchases. While  purchases of meat products, sugar, and vegetable oil increased  last year by 12-26 percent, and milk products--by 6 percent,  their sales in organized trade dropped by 4-15 percent.  <H5>  Monetary Income of the Population </H5>   The monetary income earned by the population in January of  this year amounted to R14.4 trillion and increased 9.7-fold as  compared to January 1993; adjusted for the consumer price index,  they increased by 7 percent. Disposable monetary income (income  less compulsory payments) adjusted for the consumer price index  increased over this period by 8 percent. The volume of nominal  monetary income in January of this year was lower than in  December of 1993 by 16.6 percent. This is typical for a number  of years and stems from December payment of quarterly and yearly  bonuses, as well as income in the form of interest paid on  deposits at the end of the year.    The average wages due to workers in January of  this year amounted to an estimated R145,000 and increased as  compared to December 1993 by 3 percent (in December as compared  to November it increased by 39 percent). As compared to last  January the average wage increased 9.5-fold.    Stratification of the population by level of per capita  monetary income continued to increase in January. The  income concentration index (Gini coefficient) measured 0.352 in  January 1994 as compared to 0.346 in December 1993 and 0.327 in  1992.    The value of the subsistence minimum in January  1994 amounted to R51,400 per capita, including R58,000 for  work-eligible persons, R36,200 for pensioners, and R51,300 for  children. The cost of the consumer food basket included in the  subsistence minimum accounts for 68 percent of it.    Income of a considerable part of the population (mainly  families with many children, incomplete families with children,  families with a high proportion of dependents where working  members' labor remuneration is close to the minimum, single  pensioners, and the disabled) cannot cover even the cost of the  consumer food basket taken into account in the calculation of  the subsistence minimum, which may be seen from the following  data:                      Population with monetary income below:                  subsistence minimum              cost of consumer food basket                                                  taken into account in                                                  calculating the subsistence                                                  minimum                  million        as % of total     million        as % of total                 persons        population        persons        population   January 1993   52.8           35.5              21.6           14.5    January 1994   52.6           35.4              26.3           17.7       The value of the subsistence minimum differs substantially  across the regions in Russia: from R18,000-30,000 in Ulyanovsk  Oblast, the Republic of Tatarstan, and Kursk, Tula, Orel,  Smolensk, Voronezh, and Penza Oblasts, to R73,000-97,000 in  Moscow, Amur Oblast, Khabarovsk Kray, and the Republic of Sakha  (Yakutia), and R117,000-119,000 in Sakhalin and Magadan Oblasts.  <H5>  Industrial Production </H5>   In January of this year Russian industry produced almost R16  trillion worth of output in current prices. As compared to last  January industrial production declined by 23.1 percent. As  compared to December 1993 total output declined by 17.2 percent,  and daily output--by 11 percent.    The fuel and power generation sectors in January  of this year produced 89.5 billion kw-hrs of electric power (5  percent less than in January 1993), 27.5 million tonnes of oil,  including gas condensate (10 percent less), 25.3 million tonnes  of coal (8 percent less), and 57.2 billion cubic meters of gas  (the same level of production as January 1993).    There has been a considerable decline in the output of the  main products of ferrous metallurgy. Steel smelting  in January of this year amounted to 3.9 million tonnes (23  percent below January 1993 level); pig iron production--3.0  million tonnes (17 percent less); finished rolled metal--3.0  million tonnes (20 percent less); and steel pipe--327,000 tonnes  (47 percent less).    In January of this year, the output of half the monitored  items in machine building amounted to 50 percent or  less of last year. The output of large electric machinery  amounted to 400 units (41 percent less than last January); of  metal-cutting machine tools--1,800 (47 percent less); drop forge  machines--295 (62 percent less); bulldozers--351 (46 percent  less); trucks--16,500 (60 percent less); passenger cars--21,300  (71 percent less); and tractors--2,100 (77 percent less).    In the chemical and petrochemical industry,  because of resource limitations production of most varieties of  output continued to fall in January. Overall, 660,000 tonnes of  synthetic ammonia was produced over the month (a 27-percent  decline as compared to the January 1993 level), 511,000 tonnes  of sulfuric acid (35 percent), 135,000 tonnes of calcinated soda  (47 percent), 107,000 tonnes of caustic soda (23 percent),  547,000 tonnes of mineral fertilizer (26 percent), 18,300 tonnes  of chemical thread and fiber (46 percent), and 1.8 million  automotive tires (37 percent).    In the petrochemical industry, the output of synthetic  spirits declined by 11 percent as compared to January 1993,  technical hydrocarbon--by 42 percent, and synthetic rubber--by  37 percent. A similar situation existed in the rubber-asbestos  industry: production of rubberized-fabric and conveyer-type  rubberized-cord belting, needed for repairs of agricultural  machinery, declined by 37 percent and 17 percent, respectively,  and that of metal-braid sleeves--by 68 percent.    In the timber, woodworking, and pulp and paper  industry in January of this year the outshipment of timber  amounted to 68 percent of last year's volume. Production of  lumber amounted to 1.9 million tonnes (29 percent below that for  January 1993), commercial cellulose--101,000 tonnes (30 percent  below), and cardboard--87,700 tonnes (42 percent below).    The shortage of timber raw materials resulted in a decline  in  the production of laminated plywood and window and door frames  by 21-26 percent; of mine props and shaft slab--by 34-58  percent; and of preassembled homes made of wood--by  three-quarters.    In the pulp and paper industry, as a result of difficulties  in distribution of paper, whose price has risen numerous times,  output declined by 18 percent as compared to the level of the  corresponding month of last year.    In the construction materials industry in January,  a further reduction in output was registered with respect to  products used first and foremost in industrial construction. In  particular, production of prefabricated ferroconcrete, panels  for preassembled-component house building, and aluminum alloy  components declined by 25-30 percent; of steel and roof panels  and light metal constructions--by 57-63 percent.    The output of general-use construction materials declined to  a somewhat lesser extent. Production of cement amounted to 2.3  million tonnes (40 percent less than in January 1993),  brick--1.1 billion units (22 percent less), window glass--7.0  million square meters (31 percent less), and soft roofing and  insulation materials--28.3 million square meters (39 percent  less).    A considerable decline occurred in January in the production  of asbestos-cement items. Suspension of production of high-grade  asbestos in the first half of January led to a decline in the  output of roof slate by 80 percent, and asbestos-cement pipe and  couplers by 49 percent.    Production of consumer goods in January declined  as compared to last January by 27 percent, including that of  nonfood items--by 35 percent, and  foodstuffs--by 15 percent.    At light industry enterprises in January of this  year 232 million square meters of fabrics was produced (5  percent less than in January 1993), 31.2 million pairs of  hosiery (26 percent less), 18.0 million units of knitwear (28  percent less), and 4.8 million pairs of footwear (54 percent  less).    Shortage of material and financial resources remains the  main  cause of production decline, as well as difficulties in  distribution of final products because of their high prices.    Production of goods for children is declining at a faster  rate. In January of this year as compared to last January, the  output of hosiery and knitwear for children declined by 32-45  percent, and of footwear--by almost two-thirds.    In the production of complex home appliances the  output of refrigerators and freezers, universal kitchen  appliances, and electric juicers is rising. With respect to  other varieties of home appliances, the January output was below  that for January 1993: production of washers amounted to 185,000  (41 percent less); television sets--259,000 (10 percent less);  tape recorders--102,000 units (49 percent less) and porcelain,  stoneware, and majolica tableware--36.6 million units (19  percent less).    As compared to January 1993, the output of vegetable oil,  high fat cheese and feta cheese, canned milk, and mayonnaise  increased somewhat. Production of most foodstuffs  declined somewhat as compared to January 1993: there were  192,000 tonnes of meat produced (24 percent less), 546,000  tonnes of whole milk products (16 percent less), 23,600 tonnes  of butter (39 percent less), 1,088,000 tonnes of flour (18  percent less), and 110,000 tonnes of cereals (30 percent less).    The process of sugar beet processing is nearly complete. In  January of this year 82,400 tonnes of granulated sugar was  produced from sugar beet, which is 14 percent less than over the  corresponding period of last year.    Production of canned meat, baker's yeast, tea, and macaroni  and confectionery items lagged considerably (21-41 percent)  behind that of January 1993. Commercial bakeries reduced  production of bread and bakery items by 12 percent. Production  of some varieties of baby food continues to contract. The output  of canned meat and grain-based dry mixes for baby and  restricted-diet nutrition amounted to 20 percent and 11 percent,  respectively, of the January 1993 level. One of the main reasons  for this contraction is a build-up of unsold inventories at  enterprises.  <H5>  Preparation for Spring Sowing </H5>   On the threshold of spring sowing, Russia's enterprises are  in somewhat worse shape with respect to supply of seed of spring  grain crops.    By the beginning of February the seed supply at farms  amounted to 10.3 million tonnes of spring grain crop seeds (not  including corn), or 98.5 of the needed quantities as determined  by the farms themselves. The supply of wheat and millet seed is  adequate.    At the same time, farms are short 9,000 tonnes of buckwheat  seed (7 percent), 5,000 tonnes of rice seed (8 percent), and  115,000 tonnes of legume seed (12 percent).    There is a considerable shortage of seed potatoes (441,000  tonnes, or 17 percent).

Farms in Kaluga,  Yaroslavl, Samara, Penza, Tyumen, and Chita Oblasts have 80-90  percent of needed quantities; at the same time, in most of the  territories listed above this year's spring sowing will have to  make up for a considerable shortfall in the sowing of winter  grain crops in the fall of last year.    Farms in Smolensk, Perm, and Sverdlovsk Oblasts and  Bashkortostan have 56-65 percent of the needed quantities of  seed potatoes; in Vladimir, Moscow, and Lipetsk Oblasts--71-75  percent.    Preparation of machinery for spring field work is proceeding  at a slower pace that past years. By the beginning of this  February one-fourth of tractors and trucks and approximately  one-third of plows, cultivators, and seeders were in need of  repair.

In January of this year agricultural petroleum products  storage facilities received one-third less diesel fuel and  gasoline than January last year. Stocks of petroleum products as  of 1 February were considerably below last year's level.

At agricultural enterprises, which account for the  production  of 60-70 percent of all animal husbandry output, production  volumes in January were as follows:                              January                          1993               1994               1994 as % of                                                               1993   Livestock and          511                415                81  poultry sold for  slaughter in live  weight, thousand  tonnes   Gross milk yield,      1,759              1,510              86  thousand tonnes   Milk yield per cow,    136                126                93  kg   Hen eggs produced,     2.5                2.3                94  million units   Average yield of       19                 18                 95  eggs per laying hen,  units      The output of animal husbandry products at agricultural  enterprises declined practically everywhere. As compared to last  January, sales of livestock and poultry for slaughter declined  in 62 territories of Russia; gross milk yield--in all  territories with the exception of Krasnoyarsk Kray and  Yevreyskaya Autonomous Oblast; and egg production--in 56  regions. The most significant decline in the production of meat,  milk, and eggs took place at agricultural enterprises in Kursk,  Tambov, Rostov, and Omsk Oblasts and Stavropol Kray.    The production decline in most territories was caused mainly  by reductions in the herd of livestock and poultry. By the  beginning of February the herd of horned cattle at agricultural  enterprises had decreased by 10 percent as compared to the  corresponding date of last year; cows--by 7 percent, swine--by  13 percent, and sheep and goats--by 22 percent.    The greatest reductions in the herd of main categories of  livestock occurred at farms in Kursk, Volgograd, Samara,  Saratov, Rostov, Tomsk, Tyumen, and Kaliningrad Oblasts and  Stavropol Kray.    The decline in the size of herd at agricultural enterprises  is only partially offset by an increase in the number of animals  on the population's personal plots.  <H5>  City and Local Transportation Services for the Population </H5>   In January 1994 in almost one-quarter of the republic's  capital cities and kray and oblast centers of the Russian  Federation more than 15 percent of the planned trips by city  ground passenger transportation were not made. The figures for  individual cities where public transportation operations were  most irregular are presented below:       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |Scheduled trips not made by urban transportation   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |thousands                |(%)                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Cities where 30% or more of scheduled trips were not made                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Groznyy                  |33.5                     |55                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk        |8.8                      |32                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Tver                     |44.2                     |31                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Astrakhan                |28.5                     |31                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Cities where 20% to 30% of scheduled trips were not made                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Vladikavkaz              |32.2                     |27                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Smolensk                 |27.1                     |27                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Moscow                   |849.3                    |24                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Krasnoyarsk              |72.0                     |24                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Orenburg                 |53.3                     |24                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Khabarovsk               |26.0                     |22                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Tula                     |55.9                     |21                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Kaluga                   |29.9                     |20                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Cities where 15% to 20% of scheduled trips were not made                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Cheboksary               |28.7                     |16                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Kaliningrad              |17.2                     |16                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Lipetsk                  |28.1                     |15                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Vladivostok              |21.0                     |15                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Nalchik                  |12.8                     |15                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Elista                   |5.5                      |15                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      The most unsatisfactory was suburban bus service in the  following cities: Groznyy (50 percent, or 1,500, scheduled runs  not performed); Makhachkala (48 percent, 2,100); Astrakhan (25  percent, 1,400); Orenburg (23 percent, 3,700); Novosibirsk (21  percent, 3,400); Rostov-na-Donu (18 percent, 2,900); and  Volgograd (18 percent, 2,500).    During January of this year 1,300 runs on local commuter  electric trains (34 percent of the scheduled number) were  canceled in Volgograd; in St. Petersburg--100 (1 percent);  Moscow--74 (0.2 percent); Krasnoyarsk--32 (2 percent); Kursk--28  (5 percent); and Tver--8 (1 percent).  <H5>  Exchange Trading </H5>   As of the beginning of 1994, 180 commodity, commodity and  stock, and stock exchanges were operating in Russia. Over the  past year their number decreased by almost one-third. Most  exchanges that ceased operations were in Moscow, Novosibirsk,  Tyumen, Samara, and Saratov Oblasts, and Maritime Kray. Exchange  closings are mostly the result of their conversion into trading  houses, liquidation of economically weak exchanges, and loss of  buyers because of high prices for products and goods.    Over the elapsed year exchange activities were characterized  by the following data:       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |1993                     |1993 as % of 1992        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Trading sessions conduct-|16.3                     |81                       |  |ed, thousands            |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Deals concluded, thousan-|400.5                    |2 times                  |  |ds                       |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Exchange turnover in cur-|1,634                    |4.7 times                |  |rent prices, billion rub-|                         |                         |  |les                      |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |including:               |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |consumer goods           |215.5                    |2.0 times                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |as % of total turnover   |13                       |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |producer goods           |695.5                    |3.1 times                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |as % of total turnover   |42                       |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |monetary resources       |234.6                    |41 times                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |as % of total turnover   |14                       |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |securities               |482.1                    |80 times                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |as % of total turnover   |30                       |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      The bulk of exchange activities is concentrated at 40  exchanges (13 of which are in Moscow), which account for 87  percent of all turnover.    Typically they hold trading sessions regularly; their volume  of sales is on the increase; and they deal in futures contracts  that guarantee delivery of a product at a certain time. The  proportional share of operations in buying and selling futures  contracts amounted to 9 percent of the 1993 turnover as compared  to 1 percent at the beginning of the same year.    In December 1993 four exchanges (Moscow commodity, Russian  commodity and raw materials, Russian grain commodities, and  Murmansk commodity and raw materials) began selling agricultural  products received from the United States as humanitarian aid.  Over this month they sold 510,000 tonnes of wheat, 210,000  tonnes of corn, 85,000 tonnes of rice, 4,500 tonnes of pork, and  1,600 tonnes of chicken legs. Average exchange prices were  considerably lower than domestic producers' prices: the price of  pork was R700-800 per kg, chicken legs--R1,000, wheat--R27-32,  corn--R25, and rice--R75 per kg.    The structure of exchange turnover has changed. Over the  elapsed year the share of sales of securities and monetary  resources increased by 41 percentage points, while that of  consumer goods and producer goods declined, respectively, by 18  and 23 percentage points.    The volume of output sold through exchanges remains  insignificant in the total production and amounts to about 2  percent; with respect to individual items it fluctuates in the  range of between 0.05 percent and 6 percent. Many enterprises  and organizations in the environment of poor solvency and high  exchange prices prefer to purchase products direct or through  barter. In particular, in 1993 direct sales of automotive  gasoline were 5.5 times greater than those through exchanges,  and of diesel fuel--18 times greater.

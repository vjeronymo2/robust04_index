			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / EU curb on Greek livestock The European Union has placed Greece under quarantine for exports of livestock and fresh meat following an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease. The decision, due to be published in the EU's official journal today, also orders tight controls on exports of processed meat and dairy products, said Mr Vassilis Vasilakakis, deputy agriculture minister. 'The EU banned exports of live animals and fresh meat until August 22 when a committee will review the decision, taken last night. There is no threat to public health, we are on 24-hour alert, and we are meeting EU directives,' he said. Bulgaria, which borders Greece in the northeast, already has ordered a ban on trucks that fail to carry a decontamination certificate for the disease, he said.</p>

			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Japan's current account surplus rises Japan's politically troublesome current account surplus crept up in February for the third month running, to an unadjusted Dollars 11.94bn (Pounds 8bn). The increase, 0.1 per cent more than the Dollars 11.93bn recorded in the same month of last year, was in line with market expectations and reflects the sharp rise in the yen's value against the dollar in February. This inflated the dollar value of exports and encouraged a rise in imports. The February figure marks a slowdown in the rate of increase in the surplus, from the 30.9 per cent year-on-year rise in January's current account gap. The trade surplus rose 2.5 per cent over the same period, to Dollars 12.9bn. That came on a 4.7 per cent increase in exports, to Dollars 28.8bn, and a slightly stronger 6.5 per cent rise in imports to Japan, to Dollars 15.9bn, a sign of a tentative pick-up in domestic demand. In yen terms the surplus shrank 12.1 per cent from February 1993, to Y1,268bn (Pounds 8.3bn). This decline in the yen value of the surplus will continue, a Finance Ministry official forecast. Eventually the dollar value of the surplus is expected to follow suit, as the high dollar price of Japanese exports starts to erode sales. Separately, machine tool orders fell 16.7 per cent in the year to Feb-ruary, according to industry figures, indicating a pause in the slight recovery shown in the previous month. Foreign investors continued their buying spree of Japanese shares in February, setting a new record, the Finance Ministry announced. They bought a net Dollars 11.3bn of Japanese stocks, beating the previous record, in January, of Dollars 10.5bn of net purchases. This completes an eight-month run in which foreign institutions were net buyers, a factor in the stock market's recent strength.</p>

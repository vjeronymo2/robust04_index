			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / International Company News: Disposals ease burden of deficits - Spain could raise up to Dollars 2.8bn through share issues THE Spanish government has long intended to raise cash this year through disposals in order to lighten its deficit burden. The surprise is the amount it seems to want and the speed with which it hopes to raise it. Hot on the heels of the announcement by Repsol, the government-controlled energy group, that it is seeking to raise more than Dollars 500m in an international share issue, Argentaria, the wholly state-owned banking corporation, has said that it wants to put 25 per cent of itself on the market in order to raise about Dollars 1.3bn. These disposals are likely to be followed by two further placements. Analysts expect the government to offer investors around 10 per cent of its 67 per cent stake in Endesa, the large electrical utility, in an issue that could raise Dollars 860m. They also see a possible placement of as much as 20 per cent of Tabacalera, the tobacco-based group in which the government has a 54 per cent holding, which would realise a further Dollars 173m. If all four issues took place, the state would net around Dollars 2.8bn  - more than double the government's estimates in its 1993 budget. The most common explanation for this increase is that the government urgently needs income because it has got its budgetary sums wrong. It is particularly worried that it will be unable to reduce the budget deficit this year by a planned two points, to 2.5 per cent of gross domestic product. Those fears are well grounded. The budget forecast 1 per cent growth for 1993, an estimate that now appears wildly off-target. 'We believe the economy will grow by 0.3 per cent this year and we may be optimistic,' says Mr Jaine de Pinies, head of research at Banco Santander de Negocios. Just as ominously, there has been no sign so far that government spending has been contained. In fact, analysts expect spending to rise, partly because this is an election year and partly because of the demands on the social security department by the growing legions of the unemployed. Barred from any move that might kick-start the economy, such as lowering the cost of borrowing (because high interest rates are required to refinance existing government debt) and also blocked - because of the elections - from raising taxes, the government has few options other than to sell off as much as it can. The question is: can it sell so much, so quickly? 'If the disposals are tackled intelligently, spaced out and properly priced, the market should absorb them without difficulty,' says Mr Juan Bastos, director-general of the Madrid securities firm Gestemar. Repsol, Endesa and Tabacalera are all actively-traded blue chips that need no introduction to investors. Argentaria, though a newcomer to the trading floor, is a powerful and sound institution that may offer an opportunity to gain a presence in Spain's profitable banking sector. If potential investors have reason to be bullish, the government is equally justified in being encouraged by the prospective placements. The disposals should help see it through what looks like being an otherwise bleak year.</p>

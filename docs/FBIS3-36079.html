The delegation will  apparently include Federation Council Speaker Vladimir Shumeyko;  Vadim Gustov, chairman of the Federation Council's committee for  CIS affairs; Yevgeniy Pavlov, his deputy; and Viktor Stepanov,  Federation Council member and chairman of the Karelian Supreme  Soviet.    Vadim Gustov recalled that the meeting of CIS parliamentary  heads at St. Petersburg on 8-9 February will focus on the  election of an Interparliamentary Assembly chairman "to replace  the departed Ruslan Khasbulatov." According to Gustov, reports  that Vladimir Shumeyko has recently offered the post of "CIS  speaker" to the "fired" Stanislav Shushkevich "do not square  with reality, because this post can only be held by an acting  head of parliament." He said that "talk about Shushkevich took  place before all the recent events."    The chairman of the Federation Council's committee for CIS  affairs listed legislative enactments that would be worked out  under "Russia's sponsorship." Some of them are based on the CIS  "Treaty on Collective Security" (many provisions of which  Stanislav Shushkevich opposed as speaker of the Belarusian  Supreme Soviet); they include enactments on the procedure for  imposing martial law on CIS territory, "On Mobilization," "On  the Procedure for the Development, Production, Testing, and  Delivery of Armaments and Military Hardware," and so forth.    The IPA plenary session scheduled for the beginning of March  will set up a number of commissions which, the CIS committee  chairman assured, "Russia will join, bringing all its ideas  along, because in the light of its experience it has always been  and will be the main source and drafter of legislation within  the CIS."</p>

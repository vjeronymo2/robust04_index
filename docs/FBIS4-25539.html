			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 10 (XINHUA) -- The Democratic  People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) today renewed its appeal to  the United States to work for the establishment of a new  peace-safeguarding mechanism to guarantee peace and security in  the Korean peninsula.    The DPRK renewed its appeal after the United States accused  the DPRK of "violating the 1953 Korean Armistice Agreement" by  creating a Korean People's Army (KPA) Mission to replace the  DPRK's delegation to the Military Armistice Commission.    "The U.S. side is well advised to choose to establish a new  peace arrangement whereby the danger of war can be prevented and  peace and security definitely guaranteed, instead of trying to  revive the armistice mechanism whose function has been  completely paralyzed by it," a spokesman for the KPA Mission  said.    On April 28, the DPRK issued a statement through its Foreign  Ministry proposing the establishment of a new peace mechanism to  replace the existing Military Armistice Commission (MAC), but  the proposal was rejected by the United States.    In late May, the DPRK recalled all the representatives of  the  KPA from the MAC and set up a KPA Mission at Panmunjom  responsible for contact with American and South Korean military  authorities.    Earlier this month, a meeting of MAC secretaries was  proposed  by the United States, and the DPRK sent delegates to the meeting  under the name of the KPA Mission.    In response, the U.S. read a statement at the conference  hall calling the DPRK's act a "violation of the armistice  agreement."    In today's statement the spokesman said, "The establishment  of the KPA Mission at Panmunjom was a realistic and timely step  taken to tide over the present situation in which the armistice  agreement had been reduced to a mere sheet of paper and the MAC  remained only in name due to the unreasonable behavior of the  U.S. side."    He also charged that because of the "query by the U.S.  side,"  both the MAC and the neutral nations supervisory commission  exist in name only, with no role to play.    "Whether the U.S. accepts our new proposal or not is a  touchstone for the fundamental question of war or peace," the  spokesman said in the statement, released by the DPRK's official  news agency, KCNA.    The DPRK and Western countries have been locked in  controversy over the DPRK's nuclear program. The DPRK says its  nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only while Western  countries, particularly the United States, have suspected the  DPRK of trying to divert nuclear materials for other purposes.    Today in Seoul, South Korean President Kim Yong-sam, in a  phone conversation with President Clinton, reiterated his  country's policy of close cooperation with the United States in  handling the nuclear issue.    The U.S.and South Korea are attempting to seek U.N.  sanctions  against the DPRK, which has warned that imposition of sanctions  would be considered as an act of war.    On Thursday [9 June], former U.S. President Jimmy Carter  said  he and his wife will visit both the DPRK and South Korea next  week as private citizens and that he hopes to discuss "important  issues of the day with leaders."    "The initiative for this trip has been from Korea, not  Washington, and I will have no official status relating to the  U.S. Government," Carter said.</p>

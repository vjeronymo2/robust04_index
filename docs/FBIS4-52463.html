The Iranian foreign minister, Mr. Velayati, was  interviewed by our radio correspondent in Tehran on this  occasion. The Iranian foreign minister said the visit to Iran  by President Le Duc Anh was an important and historical mark of  relations between the two countries. All meetings and talks  between the two presidents as well as between ministers of the  two countries were successful. The two sides agreed to set up  an intergovernmental committee on economic,  scientific-technical, cultural, and trade cooperation between  Vietnam and Iran.    Asked by our correspondent on the perspective to promote  bilateral ties, the Iranian foreign minister said:    [Begin Velayati recording in English] As I said to His  Excellency, the visit of President Anh is considered as a very  important visit and could be considered as a milestone in our  bilateral relations. Not only two presidents have had very  constructive and fruitful talks, but also besides that the  different ministers from both sides have started to talk in  different terms about different kinds of cooperation. This  morning, both presidents have decided to hold the (first  economic commission) session here and this afternoon, what they  decided was materialized. It is quite natural that political  relations mark the first step. Other kinds of relations should  be based on the political relations. We cannot promote well the  economic relations without promoting of political relations. So  one year ago your prime minister came here and that was the  first visit of a foreign minister of Vietnam to Iran and since  then both countries have (?wrought out) on the trip of his  excellency the president to Iran. The most important part of  discussions which have been held between our two countries has  been those devoted to the economic relations. So, yes, there is  a good hope for the promotion of relations and economic  relations. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sao Paulo, April 26 (CTK) -- Today, Premier Vaclav  Klaus ended his 10-day South American visit with discussions  with Sao Paulo State Governor Luis Fleur. The state of Sao Paulo  is the largest industrial, trade, and financial center of the  Federal Republic of Brazil and forms almost half of its GDP.    Klaus told reporters that the discussions focused on the  possibility of the export of Czech transport equipment,  specifically trams, buses, and trolley-buses. He said the Czech  side would soon receive the conditions of a tender to be  announced during the following months, which would concern the  development of the transport system in one of the biggest towns  in the world.    Fleur called for the formation of joint ventures between  Czech and Sao Paulo firms to make easier the realization of  specific orders for equipment to develop and improve the town's  transport system, which fails to meet the needs of the town's 16  million inhabitants.</p>

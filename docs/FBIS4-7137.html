			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 23 (KCNA) -- Foreign newspapers  edited special write-ups and radios broadcast special programmes  on the occasion of the birthday of the great leader President  Kim Il-song.    The Thai paper SIN CHUNG YUAN PAO said under the title  "President Kim Il-song's Worship of People":    President Kim Il-song's worship of the popular masses  epitomizes deep respect, care and love for them, devoted service  for them, absolute belief in their great strength and reliance  on it.    Korea's compulsory free education, free medical care,  abolition of taxation, free grant of dwelling houses built at  state expenses, that make people happy, are all a fruition of  the president's worship of the people.    The people express their feelings, saying they owe their  motherland and future to the leader who backs and leads them.    The noble relations of kinship between the leader and the  people who worship each other produced Korea's unique society  where the leader and the people are closely united into one.    The Thai paper XING SAN RIBAO carried an article headlined  "President Kim Il-song's Motto -- To Believe in the People as in  Heaven."    The Ugandan paper MUNNO, the Nepalese paper RISING NEPAL and  the Romanian magazine EUROPA also dedicated articles to April 15.    The Russian paper PATRIOT devoted two whole pages to special  writeups under headline "For Happiness of the People and  Prosperity of the Country" with a portrait of President Kim  Il-song.</p>

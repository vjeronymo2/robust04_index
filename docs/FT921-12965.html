			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar confined to tight range FEARS OF central bank intervention to cap any rise in the dollar continued to dominate the foreign exchange markets yesterday, confining the US currency to a tight range, writes Simon London. Trading was nervous overnight in Tokyo, although intervention by the Bank of Japan and the US Federal Reserve, rumoured late on Tuesday, failed to materialise. The US unit fell sharply against the yen in London late on Tuesday when the US authorities were reported to be preparing the ground for intervention. However, reports that the Bank of Japan was checking rates, matching action by the Federal Reserve in New York, sent the dollar to Y123.15, its low of the session. The dollar ended in Tokyo at Y123.34 and DM1.5878, from a close in New York of Y123.60 and DM1.5865. The slight weakness of the yen was blamed on a sharp fall in some Japanese money market interest rates. For example, three months certificates of deposit traded down to 4.95 per cent from 5.20 per cent on Tuesday. In Europe, the major currencies were again tied within very tight trading ranges. The threat of intervention and caution ahead of this weekend's meeting of G7 finance ministers and central bankers were blamed for the generally featureless trade. After peaking at Y123.64 and DM1.5905 very early in the European session, the US currency fell back until US housing construction data prompted a mild recovery. Figures for December showed a 0.2 per cent decrease in new housing starts against November, for a seasonally adjusted rate of growth of 2.6 per cent, seen by most analysts as a positive indicator of economic activity. The dollar responded with a firmer tone, improving to Y123.45 and DM1.5885. The US currency closed in London at Y123.20 from Tuesday's Y123.10, and DM1.5875 from DM1.5830. In New York the dollar firmed to finish at Y123.35 and DM1.5895. Within the European exchange rate mechanism, the D-Mark weakened following the collapse of pay negotiations between the steel workers union and employers. The collapse of talks means that the union will now hold a strike ballot in pursuit of its pay claim. The German currency closed easier at FFr3.4086, from FFr3.4095 on Tuesday; L752.20 from L752.70; and Pta63.19 from Pta63.21. Sterling's gain was greater than other European currencies against the D-Mark, however, rising to a more comfortable level above its permitted floor within the ERM. The pound ended at DM2.8675, from DM2.86 on Tuesday. Today, German M3 money supply statistics for December are due for release. Broad money growth ran at 5.1 per cent in November, just outside the Bundesbank's 3 per cent to 5 per cent target range. Any acceleration will be taken as a sign that German interest rates must stay high.</p>

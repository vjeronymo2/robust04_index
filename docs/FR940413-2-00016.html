The primary purpose of the cooperative agreement is the replenishment of chinook salmon in the Columbia River. This one year effort will have a total estimated cost of $170,000, of which $120,000 will be provided by DOE and $50,000 will be provided by YIN. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> for further information contact: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Questions regarding this announcement should be addressed to the U.S. Department of Energy, Richland Operations Office, Procurement Division, Mail Stop A7&hyph;80, P.O.

Each Operations Office has been charged with notifying the public of available facilities, technology partnership opportunities and economic development and diversification programs for the purpose of stimulating local economic growth through community partnerships. In addition, as part of the cleanup and restoration mission for the Hanford Site and the nearby Columbia River, plans for replenishing, replacing and enhancing the stock of returning chinook salmon to this area are encouraged. With the closure of all nuclear reactors on the Hanford Site, a number of facilities have become available for use by others. The Yakima Indian Nation is proposing to use water treatment pools located at the site of the former 100 Area K-E reactor for the purpose of rearing and acclimating one-half million upriver bright fall chinook salmon. It is anticipated that some portion of the juvenile fall chinook salmon reared and released as a result of this project will return as adults. These returning adults will contribute to the area economy by increasing the salmon available for tribal, commercial, and sports fishermen. In addition, some of these returning adults will spawn naturally to continue the cycle for future generations. The ultimate goal is to restore the chinook salmon to its historic level in the Columbia River. The Yakima Indian Nation, as co-manager of the Columbia River salmon resources, has coordinated the development of the project with the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife, the National Marine Fisheries Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The project has also been authorized and endorsed by the 1993&hyph;94 Columbia River Production Agreement in which the Yakima Indian Nation was identified as the lead agency for implementing this project. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: April 5, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Robert D.

			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Wessex Water Wessex Water is in a happy position among water companies. Like its larger peers, it is striving to generate profits which cannot be touched by the regulator. Unlike Thames and Severn Trent, Wessex is small enough that if its unregulated businesses oblige, it has scope to increase dividends without offending its water customers. Judging by yesterday's annual results, Wessex is well on course. The five-month contribution from its joint venture with Waste Management was ahead of expectations. It might make Pounds 4m this year, equivalent to 5 per cent of group pre-tax profits. By mid-decade, it could be making 10 times as much. In expanding, Wessex will struggle to replicate the favourable terms of the venture with Waste Management. There are plenty of small acquisitions available, but that approach will take longer than another large deal. Shareholders are doubtless happy to stay on board regardless.</p>

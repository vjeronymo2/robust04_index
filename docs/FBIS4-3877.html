			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, April 25 (XINHUA) -- Russian Deputy Foreign  Minister Aleksandr Panov today described Russian-Chinese  relations as a priority in the country's foreign policy.    Speaking in the State Duma (the lower house of the Russian  Parliament) Panov said his ministry was implementing plans to  strengthen bilateral ties with China and bring Russian-Chinese  relations to a level of constructive partnership.    Panov, who is in charge of Asian affairs and a former  ambassador to South Korea, dwelt at length on problems in  Russian-Chinese relations, cautioning about the massive Chinese  immigration into Russia.    He noted that a current agreement drastically cuts the  number  of people entitled to a visa-free entry to Russia.    In the light of the acute border issue which exists between  the two, a joint Russian-Chinese commission is now actively  working to resolve questions on ownership of disputed islands on  border rivers.    Panov also told the State Duma that talks are in progress to  agree on cutting the strength of Russian and Chinese troops in  border areas.    He said he believed the infrastructure of the  Russian-Chinese  border should be further developed to promote trade and economic  cooperation, adding that the turnover of border trade totalled  2.5 billion U.S. dollars in 1993.    The deputy minister also stressed the need to help the  modernization of Chinese industrial enterprises built with  Soviet assistance in the 1950s.</p>

			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Germany cedes the lead on European rates: How inflation robbed Frankfurt of its place as the EC's interest policy model DURING most of the 14 years of operation of the European Monetary System (EMS), one country habitually has had the EC's lowest short-term interest rates: Germany. As part of the seismic shift in the European monetary landscape caused by the strains of German re-unification, that has changed. Beset by an inflation rate of close to 4 per cent - twice as high as the Bundesbank would like - and a high budget deficit, Germany has lost its place as the Community's interest rate paradigm. With Europe suffering its period of slowest growth for more than a decade, all countries are easing their monetary policies. But Germany - as was underlined by the low-profile action from the Bundesbank yesterday - is adopting a more cautious stance than the others. D-Mark interest rates are therefore being undercut by a number of countries both within and outside the exchange rate mechanism. The Bundesbank's main obligation is to control German inflation, not to solve the difficulties of weaker currencies in the EMS. The central bank is still far from confident that German inflationary pressures have been brought under control. Among the 17 members of the EC and the European Free Trade Association, only five - Austria (4.1 per cent), Italy (4.7 per cent), Spain (5.2 per cent), Portugal (8.7 per cent) and Greece (15.9 per cent) - have higher inflation rates than Germany's 3.8 per cent. Yesterday's cuts in Dutch and Belgian official interest rates illustrate a trend in evidence since December 1991. Whereas in the past the Bundesbank's monetary moves nearly always triggered identical policy action in neighbouring countries, other EMS members are now able to take a more independent line. The same is true of Switzerland and Austria, two countries outside the EMS which traditionally have kept their currencies and their monetary policies closely aligned to Germany's. Hours before the Bundesbank's council completed its deliberations, Switzerland felt bold enough to cut its discount rate 0.5 percentage points to 5.5 per cent, taking it 2.5 points below the corresponding German level. Within the EMS, Germany now has four 'hard core' partners which have kept their exchange rates close to the D-Mark in recent years: the Netherlands, Belgium/Luxembourg, France and Denmark. The first two now have lower short-term interest rates than those in Germany. Yesterday, three-month Euro-D-Mark rates stood at 8.5 per cent, against 8.3 per cent for the Belgian franc and 8.2 per cent for the guilder. The Dutch and Belgian central banks have been able to act independently of the Bundesbank in making several successive cuts in key interest rates since September's European monetary unrest. The Belgian National Bank, which formally pegged its currency to the D-Mark in 1990, stressed yesterday that it acted 'in concert' with the Netherlands central bank. Both the Dutch and the Belgians justified their action on the grounds of their currencies' strength within the exchange rate mechanism. Both central banks this week have had to intervene to support the Irish punt. Explaining that the guilder's external strength gave the Nederlandsche Bank more leeway to cut rates, a Dutch official said yesterday: 'We are abiding by the rules of the game. We are at the top of the ERM grid.' The Swiss National Bank's go-it-alone move on the discount rate marks a further attempt to take advantage of the central bank's small margin of monetary policy independence. In December 1991, the bank decided not to follow the Bundesbank when it raised its rates by 0.5 percentage points. But the Swiss franc fell rapidly once the gap with German rates widened - leading the National Bank to drive up interest rates and rein in monetary growth in the early summer. After the autumn monetary unrest revived the Swiss franc's attractiveness as a haven currency, it strengthened considerably. Furthermore, amid continued recession in the Swiss economy, the Swiss National Bank's main target, the monetary base, showed a 1 per cent contraction between the fourth quarters of 1991 and 1992. A spokesman for the Swiss National Bank yesterday underlined how the bank was taking no risks yesterday in cutting the discount rate. 'We are confident that the Swiss franc will remain a stable currency this year,' he said. Additional reporting: Ian Rodger in Zurich and Andrew Hill in Brussels</p>

			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Sinn Fein says talks may start in a few weeks A senior member of Sinn Fein yesterday raised the prospect of talks before Christmas with the British government, saying there was 'absolutely no reason' why the two sides could not be involved in discussions 'within a matter of weeks'. The prediction - by Mr Martin McGuinness, a member of Sinn Fein's executive  -came as the hardline Democratic Unionist party indicated that last week's statement by Mr John Major, the prime minister, could pave the way for it to rejoin political talks with Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland minister. But the DUP made it clear that it did not accept that last month's IRA ceasefire announcement was not the result of a secret deal with the government. Earlier this month, Mr Major ordered Mr Ian Paisley, the DUP leader, to leave Downing Street when he refused to accept the prime minister's assurances on this matter. While Sinn Fein indicated that Mr Gerry Adams, the party's president, was set to go to the United States for several weeks before the end of the month, Mr McGuinness said it was 'quite clear' that talks would take place 'between all the parties'. 'Hopefully this will happen before Christmas,' he added. 'Hopefully Sinn Fein will be in discussion with the British government. It will be impossible for the British government not to enter talks with Sinn Fein, and it is only a matter now of when this will happen.' But in remarks made less than 48 hours after Mr Major lifted the government's broadcasting ban on Sinn Fein, Mr McGuinness said he was disappointed at a suggestion by Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, that there would be no united Ireland in this generation. 'I was surprised and disappointed to hear what Mr Reynolds had said, and I think many other people, particularly nationalists, will have been, too.' He added: 'We should not take pessimistic views at this stage. We have to be realistic, but we should not be pessimistic.' Commenting on Mr Major's promise last week to submit the outcome of political talks to a referendum inside Northern Ireland, Mr McGuinness said any settlement reached would have to be put to all the people of Ireland. 'It is quite clear that Irish nationalist opinion is agreed that there can be no internal settlement, that there can be no partitionist arrangement and there can be no veto for anyone.' Mr Adams is widely expected to be granted a visa enabling him to go ahead with plans to visit at least 10 US cities in spite of the fact that republican leaders have still not satisfied the British government that the IRA's ceasefire is permanent. Downing Street said yesterday that it was 'still waiting to hear' that the ceasefire was permanent. It added that it was up to the US to decide on the granting of a visa but: 'We have always said the Americans will no doubt want to hear from Mr Adams about permanence.'</p>

			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / International Company News: Desperate days in Daf's demise - Kevin Done charts the final months of the Dutch truck maker AS THE waters closed over Daf at the end of January, the troubled Dutch commercial vehicle maker had finally begun to achieve an operating profit on its core operations. The signs of a tentative recovery provided cold comfort to the hapless holders of the now worthless shares in old Daf (Daf NV), however, at Thursday's emotional, six-hour shareholders' meeting. Mr Cor Baan, formerly chief executive of old Daf and now chief executive of the reborn Daf Trucks, tried to justify past management actions. 'The question everyone is asking themselves . . . is, how could Daf get into this state? We are convinced that we did everything possible to guide Daf through the difficult period.' Daf filed for protection from its creditors in The Netherlands on February 2. Leyland Daf, its UK subsidiary, went into administrative receivership a day later. Mr Baan drew back the veil from the intractable problems that confronted the increasingly desperate Daf management, as it battled last year to stave off collapse. For the first time, he disclosed: the extent of Daf's mismanagement of its finance subsidiary, which by the end of 1991 had landed itself with a debilitating mismatch of long-term loans financed by short-term funding; that Daf had planned to close its van operations at Birmingham in an attempt to rescue the rest of the business (the UK van operation, now close to a management buy-out, has actually been saved by Daf's financial collapse); he implicitly accepted that Daf management had been misled by its ambition to match its much bigger competitors, such as Mercedes-Benz and Iveco (Fiat), in continuing to develop and renew its entire truck range without a strategic partner, in spite of Daf's much smaller sales and production volumes; he expressed regret that Daf had agreed to take over British Leyland's van operations (Freight Rover), when it also acquired Leyland's truck operations in 1987. 'The whole of 1992 was marked by a difficult and time-consuming process concerning short and long-term financing,' said Mr Baan. He revealed that Daf's banking consortium had already sought collateral for their loans at the start of 1992, as the company was failing to meet some of the ratios stipulated in its loan agreements. 'The financial situation throughout the second half of 1992 was such that discussions took place with the banking consortium virtually every month concerning an extension of the bank facility agreement,' he said. Mr Baan disclosed that it was the banks that had finally forced the company to find a deal that would force it to give up its independence. The banking consortium set the condition in its facility agreement in June 1992 that Daf should enter 'co-operation with a financially strong partner' as quickly as possible, he said. The prime candidate for a partner was Mercedes-Benz of Germany, the world's biggest truck maker. The Dutch group's bankers insisted that Mercedes-Benz should be persuaded to take an equity stake in Daf, however, which the Dutch company's managers found difficult to bear. Mr Baan said that Daf also held exploratory discussions with Hino of Japan and Cummins, the US engine manufacturer, but 'no longer-term structural solution was offered'. By October 1992, with no progress on the Mercedes-Benz alliance, the company had begun to formulate 'a new, accelerated and far-reaching plan for reorganisation'. The earlier action plan Operations 92/93, implemented only 10 months before, had already become 'completely inadequate', admitted Mr Baan. By the end of January this year, Daf planned: to cut another 4,000 jobs, or a third of its workforce (the payroll had already fallen from 16,782 in 1989 to 12,289 in 1992); to cut the management board from six to four, and to halve the corporate staff to 75; to end van production in Birmingham, which employed 2,000, and to pull out of a project with Renault to develop a new generation of vans; to sell the Daf Finance subsidiary 'as soon as possible'. This drastic restructuring was expected to cause an extraordinary charge of Fl 700m (Dollars 389m), which would have wiped out the group's entire Fl 458m equity. Mr Baan revealed that the deep-rooted problems of Daf Finance meant that for the whole of 1992 the group was forced to operate without a captive finance company. The slide in Daf Finance's fortunes meant that financiers were no longer willing to provide long-term funds, so expiring long-term borrowings had to be converted into short-term debt. In 1991, 56 per cent of Daf Finance's Fl 1.3bn portfolio of long-term loans was funded by short-term debt. As funding to Daf Finance dried up, the group's liquidity problems intensified. Mr Baan admitted that in late-1991 and early-1992, Daf 'was already considering stopping the financing activities entirely, but it was not deemed advisable to signal this to the market'. Daf could wait no longer. Mr Baan said that sales financing was substantially reduced from mid-1992 and 'finally completely stopped'. Daf Finance made a loss of Fl 130m last year, including a Fl 95m charge to facilitate its disposal. Daf Finance's balance sheet had mushroomed from Fl 849m in 1986 to Fl 2.66bn in 1991. Mr Baan insisted, however, that 'conclusions suggesting that Daf bought market shares through the finance company and that the company attracted customers who by definition can be regarded as being in the category of doubtful debtors are absolutely incorrect.'  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                             DAF PRODUCTION  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                % change                               1989     1990     1991     1992   92 v 89  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Daf Eindhoven (medium/heavy trucks)       18,432   17,207   14,468   13,775   -25.3 Daf Leyland (light trucks)  16,310   12,786   11,905   13,846   -15.1 SUB-TOTAL                   34,742   29,993   26,373   27,621   -20.5 Daf Birmingham (vans)       23,616   24,575   22,274   20,099   -14.9 TOTAL                       58,358   54,568   48,647   47,720   -18.2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Daf  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

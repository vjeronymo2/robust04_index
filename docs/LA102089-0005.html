			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KEEPING RTD BUSES ON TIME  </P> <P> I am a bus operator working out of Division 5 in South-Central Los Angeles.  This slam at my fellow operators angers me. I love my job and what I do. But  I'm sure that the author wants answers not explanations. We stress teamwork on  the job and most of the time it works as it was intended.  </P> <P> Sir, this is a large city, a first-rate city with a first-rate transit system.  With so many people unable to afford a car, let alone the necessary insurance  costs that go with owning that car, we provide a lifeline for seniors,  students, shoppers and working people. We're their wheels and we really do the  best we can at all times. And it isn't always easy.  </P> <P> GEORGE STAFFORD  </P> <P> Manhattan Beach  </P></p>

			<p>930615 FT  15 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour to press on City crime LABOUR WILL today use the second day's scrutiny of the government's new insider dealing legislation to press ministers over the prosecution of City crime. Mr Alistair Darling, the party's City spokesman, will call for the government to consider setting up a 'streamlined, independent organisation' responsible for prosecuting City crime. 'There is a strong feeling that there are too many cooks spoiling the broth,' he said.</p>

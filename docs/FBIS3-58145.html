"France is following attentively the delicate moment of  transition and change Italy is passing through," Napolitano told  ANSA after the meeting, which was also attended by his  counterpart at the French National Assembly, Philippe Seguin.    "Balladur voiced confidence that, once this moment is behind  us and a new parliament has been elected, Italy can fully resume  its role in European and international politics," said  Napolitano, also stressing that Italy's European commitment and  the broad consensus of Italians around it would certainly remain  as constants of Italian foreign policy in the future.    In a TV interview later, Napolitano reported that Prime  Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi's consultations in the last couple  of days had "undoubtedly" provided him with clarifications of  the positions of the various political parties and the  no-confidence motion presented by many MPs in the majority.    The debate on the motion is scheduled on January 12 and,  according to Napolitano, successive developments will depend on  the climate in the debate and the assessments of President Oscar  Luigi Scalfaro -- "assessments," Napolitano pointed out, "that  have already been delineated well before this initiative of the  no-confidence motion."    But Napolitano said Scalfaro's decision on whether and when  to dissolve parliament does not depend solely on what the  parties think, but will also take account of the need to  "respond to a popular vote such as the one in the referendunm  (in April) and the need to promote an indispensable political  and institutional renewal."    In his remarks to ANSA, Napolitano said other points on the  agenda with Balladur, apart from his briefing on the Italian  political situation and European issues, included unemployment  and the need for economic growth throughout Europe in order to  combat it.</p>

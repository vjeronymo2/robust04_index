			<p><P> October 1, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OJAI;  </P> <P> PANEL TO CONSIDER ADDITION AT ARCADE  </P> <P> A proposed second-story addition to a commercial building in the Ojai Arcade  will undergo review today by the Ojai Historical Preservation Commission.  </P> <P> The newly renovated arcade -- the arched walkway that fronts 13 single-story  buildings along Ojai Avenue -- is on the commission's list for designation as a  historical landmark.  </P> <P> Built in 1917, the arcade was reinforced last year to meet earthquake safety  standards at a cost of $1.7 million.  </P> <P> The commission has been asked to review how the proposed retail and office  construction might affect the arcade before the project goes to the Ojai  Planning Commission for approval.  </P> <P> Members of the city's Redevelopment Commission have expressed concern that the  rear and sides of the upper story will be visible from behind the Arcade.  Developer Larry Wilde has assured officials that it will not be visible from  the front.  </P> <P> Some merchants are also worried that the second floor will block their views of  the four-story post office bell tower on Ojai Avenue.

			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Observer: Swan song What does the secretary of the Bank of England actually do? Take Geoffrey Croughton, the current incumbent. Apart from keeping the minutes of the weekly meeting of the court of directors, Croughton has been slaving away for months organising tomorrow's Bank of England tercentenary concert at the Barbican. If anyone knows the score it is Croughton. Not only has he arranged the programme, but he will be on stage singing with the Philharmonia Chorus. Indeed, this will be his swan song. After eight years on the job, he retires at the end of the year and hands over to John Footman, the Bank's user-friendly PR chief. Footman follows in a distinguished tradition. Kenneth Grahame found time to write Wind in the Willows and several other tomes during his 10 years in the post, and Montagu Norman, who ran the Bank for 24 years, is reported to have offered the job of company secretary to TE Lawrence (of Arabia). Oddly enough, Lawrence seemed to prefer an even bigger desert.</p>

			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Mystery group buys 10% of Simpsons SIMPSONS of Cornhill, owner of the famous City chop house, yesterday began urgent moves to discover the identity of a mystery buyer who has acquired an unpalatable 10 per cent stake in the group. Directors of the Nottingham-based company, which owns two of the City's favourite watering-holes - Simpsons and the Jamaica Inn - fear the stake may be used by disgruntled shareholders to force through a resolution calling for board changes at an extraordinary general meeting scheduled for next Thursday. The stake has been acquired by Mountjoy, an offshore company registered in the Turk and Caicos Islands. Keen to identify who lies behind Mountjoy, the company has begun a 212 enquiry to force Mountjoy to name the beneficiaries of its 10.135 per cent shareholding. If the stake is controlled by the group of dissident shareholders led by Mr Robert Klapp, former chairman of Select Appointments, it could raise pressure on the board to accept a shake-up in the control of the company. The dissidents are already thought to hold more than 35 per cent of the shares and a further 10 per cent stake would improve their chances of electing two new directors including Mr Klapp. Their stakes are thought to include a 20 per cent shareholding currently owned by Mr David Rowland, the entrepreneur. Mr Klapp has agreed to buy his shares and expects to complete the deal on Monday. Mr Klapp's group claims the board is out of touch with the tough trading conditions in London, where this year the restaurant business has been as flat as a Simpsons beer mat. It also maintains the board has embarked on a costly expansion plan which has seen it acquire the upmarket Dell'Ugo restaurant in Soho and the Palio Restaurant in west London. The company's Pounds 2m flotation on the USM last August provided the funds to buy Simpsons and the Jamaica Inn. The company, however, is healthier than some of its clients, according to Mr John Glover, Simpsons business development director. 'In the 20 weeks to December last year we had a turnover of Pounds 500,000,' he said. 'We are doing well and we're always looking for investment opportunities.' Dismissing the chances of the dissident resolution being accepted, he added: They 'have nothing to offer.'</p>

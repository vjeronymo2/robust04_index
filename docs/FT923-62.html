			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / International Equity Issues: Turmoil causes Swedish government to postpone Procordia privatisation RECENT turmoil in the European financial markets has taken its toll on the international equity issues business. The Swedish government has decided to postpone the privatisation of Procordia, the Swedish food and pharmaceutical group, because of the unfavourable stock market conditions, and investment bankers claim that fewer companies are lining up to launch international equity offerings while the markets are in such an unsettled state. The privatisation of Procordia was expected to take place this autumn, but has now been scheduled for the spring - provided stock market conditions prove more conducive. The Swedish stock market has plummeted recently on worries about possible devaluation of the krona, concern over the troubled financial sector, and against a backdrop of very high interest rates. The government agreed an economic package with the main opposition parties on September 20 aimed at boosting confidence in the Swedish economy and, at the same time, said it would postpone selling its shares in Procordia. Bankers point out that, given the current state of the Swedish stock market, it could prove hard to drum up much retail interest in the offering. About half of the shares will be aimed at international investors, while the rest will be aimed at domestic buyers. Procordia's stock market capitalisation has fallen to SKr35.3bn (Dollars 6.4bn) from SKr45.7bn at the end of May. The Swedish state owns 40.4 per cent of Procordia's voting shares and 34.2 per cent of the total share capital. The other main shareholder in the company is Volvo, the Swedish car and truck manufacturer. Repsol, the Spanish state-owned oil, gas and chemicals group, has also delayed its planned international equity offering until next year. However, the decision to postpone the issue was not related to market conditions but hinged on the fact that Repsol must wait for parliament to lift certain legal barriers.</p>

			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Italian scandals inquiry team quits over government decree The entire team of Milan magistrates largely responsible for bringing down the post-war political system in Italy through their corruption investigations resigned last night. They did so in protest at a decree introduced by the government on Wednesday reducing their powers to use preventive detention during their investigations. Their action is the most serious challenge to the two-month-old government on an issue which the administration has sought to brush under the carpet. In the lead of those resigning was Mr Antonio Di Pietro, rated in opinion polls as one of Italy's most popular figures. He broke the original corruption scandals in Milan and has been instrumental in bringing to justice more than 300 businessmen and politicians on charges of corruption and illegal financing of political parties. It was not clear last night whether the magistrates' move - which could be followed by similar resignations round the country - was simply designed to put pressure on the government to change its mind. But in an emotional statement last night Mr Di Pietro said he and his colleagues had asked to be removed from all their current investigations because the legislation had completely undermined their task and more than two years of patient investigation. The decree, with immediate effect, was intended to prevent abuses in the use of imprisonment, which, the government claims, has been used widely to force confessions. But yesterday, the investigative magistrates insisted that imprisonment was an essential means of ensuring that evidence was not tampered with and that those under suspicion did not flee the country. The decree limits the use of preventive detention to serious crimes and excludes most of the cases under which businessmen and politicians have been imprisoned during the recent scandals. Because of it, 44 people named in new arrest warrants yesterday were all allowed to return to their homes, where they face a form of house arrest. Police yesterday issued warrants for the arrest of Mr Alberto Falck, the chairman of Falck, Italy's biggest private steelmaker, and Mr Giuseppe Tramontana, the managing director of La Rinascente, one of the country's leading retail chains. Arrest orders were also issued for the president of the Italian accountants' federation, and executives from sectors as diverse as construction, pharmaceuticals and funeral direction. Neither Falck nor La Rinascente commented on the developments. The Milan magistrates' inquiry - the latest in the two-year effort to uncover corruption - has centred on Italy's Guardia di Finanza. Officers co-operating with magistrates have alleged that large Italian companies systematically bribed a unit assigned to investigate potential tax fraud by businesses with turnover of more than L5bn (Pounds 2m) a year. Police allegedly ignored accounting abuses and tax fraud after receiving kickbacks. Italian companies caught up in corruption investigations since 1992 have always claimed they were obliged to pay bribes to political parties because it was the only way to do business under the corrupt old regime. If upheld, the new charges would cast doubt on the claim that they were reluctant parties to fraud. Eight Guardia di Finanza officers are already under arrest, and warrants for the arrest of six more were issued yesterday. Within the past week, two others have committed suicide.</p>

			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / BT risks action on work patterns British Telecommunications and the National Communications Union could be heading for industrial conflict over the company's proposals for new attendance patterns. BT wants more engineers available on weekday evenings and weekends and is offering the 27,000 affected workers four separate attendance patterns. The company says it expects employees to sign up to one of the patterns by September 16. Mr Tony Young, NCU general secretary, said yesterday that any attempt to force employees to accept new contracts would lead to a strike ballot. Union officials had hoped that their success in negotiating a Pounds 1,000 one-off payment for workers choosing the weekend patterns, and a clause insisting that workers could volunteer for any of the new patterns, would be sufficient to head off industrial action. But a large majority of the employees has rejected the deal in a consultative ballot.</p>

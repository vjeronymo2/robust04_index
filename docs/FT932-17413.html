The plans, by consultants Building Design Partnership, aim to improve facilities for spectators, players and officials. Under the proposals Number One court will be demolished to make way for a facilities building, and a new show court will be built. Planning permission is being sought and work could begin by 1995. The project will be financed by the issue of debentures.</p>

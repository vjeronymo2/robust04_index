			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / No coasting now the easy gains are over: How Barclays Bank has rebounded so far and so fast Mr Martin Taylor, chief executive of a bank that has taken only 18 months to switch from making a Pounds 242m loss to rivalling Lloyds as the most profitable and best capitalised of the big UK banks, had little truck yesterday with the suggestion that Barclays made too much money in the first half. Mr Taylor, who joined the board nine months ago to restore Barclays' fortunes, pointed out that its average post-tax return on equity for the past six years had been 4 per cent. 'That sort of return does not just damage banks, it destroys them,' he said. Barclays made an annualised return on equity of 23.6 per cent (21 per cent excluding an Pounds 87m surplus from disposals) and its tier 1 ratio of shareholders' funds to risk-weighted assets rose to 7 per cent. These were in line with Lloyds' 21.9 per cent return, and 7.1 per cent tier 1 ratio. Given Barclays' loss for 1992, and its decision to cut its dividend then, its Pounds 1.04bn pre-tax profits for the first six months impressed outsiders. 'We're starting to see the makings of a very great bank if they stay on track,' said Mr Hugh Pye, banking analyst at Barclays' investment bank BZW. Yet a closer examination of the results does not suggest a bank coasting towards ever higher returns. Operating profits fell by Pounds 108m to Pounds 1.23bn as it shrank loans and competed in an over-crowded UK market. All but Pounds 23m of the Pounds 701m rise in pre-tax profits came from a fall in bad debt charges. The fall in bad debts was more pronounced than at other banks. Its Pounds 306m provision is only 0.29 per cent of loans and advances, compared with 0.80 per cent in the same period last year. This is only just more than half Lloyds' figure of 0.55 per cent (excluding problem country provisions). Although the ratio of total provisions to troubled and non-performing loans rose from 31.8 to 35.9 per cent, the low level of new provisions could indicate that Barclays either over-provided for bad loans during the worst times, or is making inadequate provisions for fresh problems. In practice, it is hard to calculate what a normal level of provisions should be. Given continuing low inflation, bankers have started to guess at long-term provisions figures of about 0.7 per cent for a full year. This is not far from Barclays' half-year charge of just below half that. Mr Taylor was unwilling to make predictions, pointing out that bad debt charges in the last economic cycle rose to well above former peaks. 'It is difficult to keep in mind how extremely high by historical standards provisions have been. They really have been out of the window.' Mr Pye argues that Barclays' swing in provisions may be more pronounced than other banks' because it made large bad debt charges late in the last cycle. 'Their bad debts have been rather squashed up, so I don't think it is a sign of imprudence that the charge is so low,' he said. Even if provisions are appropriate, their low level means that Barclays will have to improve operating performance in the next year to sustain rises in profits. The UK clearing bank's 5 per cent operating improvement was largely due to staff cuts, and income is under strong pressure. Mr Taylor exhibited a mixture of caution and bullishness about the prospects. On the one hand, he argued that it would be impossible to maintain return on equity of above 20 per cent given the degree of competition in retail banking. 'It is bound to be competed away to some extent.' On the other, he also emphasised the strength of operating businesses such as Barclaycard. Their size would help them to design and sell products at lower cost. 'We are starting to exercise that leadership. We're not sitting here waiting for people to slice bits off us. They do that at their peril,' he said. Mr Taylor said Barclays would continue to try to employ capital better, cutting higher-risk assets and shifting capital towards those with a lower risk-weighting and higher margins. Securitisation and other measures helped reduce its risk-weighted assets by 7 per cent to Pounds 94.7bn. Yet the easiest gains may be over in terms of reducing its poor assets, while higher margins on those such as mortgages have already narrowed. This will make it harder to find good uses for the bank's growing equity capital  -up from Pounds 5.33bn to Pounds 5.9bn, with retained earnings of Pounds 530m. This might not appear too pressing a worry given Barclays' return on equity in the first half. Yet Mr Taylor emphasised that the bank has yet to prove that it can make consistent returns. 'We are conscious that we owe our shareholders a fair bit, and we are beginning to pay it back.' If anything, that may make Mr Taylor's personal task harder. Having been in place full-time only since the start of the year, he cannot claim much credit for yesterday's results. By the time shareholders look to him to demonstrate his worth, Barclays will be operating in a tougher world. Lex, Page 16; Details, Page 18</p>

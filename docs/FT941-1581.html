			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Lower whisky prices hit Burn Stewart Profits at Burn Stewart Distillers, the Scotch whisky producer, collapsed in the six months to end-December as a result of falling whisky prices. Pre-tax profits were down 58 per cent at Pounds 1.81m on sales 3.6 per cent lower at Pounds 19.5m. Mr Bill Thornton, chairman, said prices for its case sales of whisky were down 12 per cent, though volume had risen by 44 per cent. The price pressure had come chiefly from the multiple retailers. 'Pricing is the key factor for the future. Our view is that any move from here can only be up, but there's no evidence that will happen in the short term. We're optimistic about some progress in 1995.' In 1993, the company said, case sales had made up 84 per cent of its total volume and bulk sales the remainder. Of the 84 per cent, 50 percentage points went to own label and the remaining 34 to Burn Stewart brands. Bulk whisky sales were down 10 per cent by volume, Mr Thornton said. Because most of these sales were of high-margin mature malt, this had a disproportionate effect on profits. The pre-tax figure was after a gain this time on disposal of shares of Pounds 298,000. Earnings per share were 2.08p (4.95p) and the dividend was held at 1.7p.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 20 KYODO -- Japan's previous vice  finance minister, Mamoru Ozaki, was appointed Friday [20 May] by  Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii to head People's Finance Corp.,  replacing Sadaaki Hirasawa.    Hirasawa, also a former vice finance minister, is widely  expected to be become president of the Bank of Yokohama in June.    People's Finance Corp. is a government-run firm that  provides  low-interest loans to small businesses.    A rash of such high-profile appointments recently has raised  anew the issue of "amakudari," the "descent from heaven" of  ranking bureaucrats to influential private-sector positions.</p>

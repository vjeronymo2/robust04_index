			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Take a rich sprinkling of serious chefs . . .  -Nicholas Lander gathers some tips from top professionals for entertaining throughout the year Joyce Molyneux, The Carved Angel, Dartmouth, TQ6 9BH, Devon. Tel: 0803-832465. I have been cooking professionally for the past 44 years. Changes in my way of cooking may therefore be less dramatic than in that of younger chefs. But such is the nature of this profession that beneficial influences can come from the most unlikely source. We have vastly improved our method of cleaning scallops as a result of watching the local fish shops' treatment of queen scallops. Our former method was slow and messy. Now we remove the top shell then, using a knife or spoon with a sharpened edge, cut behind the muscle and roe to separate it from the stomach, frill and debris and lift out the scallop and roe. Then the scallop only needs minimal treatment to remove the hard gristle on the side. Around this time of the year we also order seeds from the new catalogues. Thanks to another chef I can heartily recommend Greek Cross (from Suffolk Herbs). It is a tangy mustard-like plant that grows easily (and incidentally runs to seed just as easily) but is delicious in salads. More by accident we also discovered a red cabbage, red onion and beetroot combination that is excellent with game, pork and ham. Add half the volume of coarsely- grated beetroot and sweated red onion to the red cabbage braised in the normal manner. Mix in, adjust the seasoning and reheat to serve. Finally, we make over 1,000 Christmas puddings each year. Our streamlined production may help others. We put in a blender: eggs, apple, crystallised ginger, lemon and orange juice, brandy and lemon and orange peel removed with a potato peeler. Blend well, then put into a bowl with all the dry ingredients. I have not tried it but I think the base mix in the blender would make a nice baked pudding on its own.</p>

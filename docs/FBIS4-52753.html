			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 13 KYODO -- A Japanese business leader  urged Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata on Friday [13 May] to relax  various government regulations on real estate trading and  telecommunications-related industries, business federation  officials said.    Isao Nakauchi, vice chairman of the Federation of Economic  Organizations (Keidanren), paid a visit to Hata's residence for  the first time since the premier formed his cabinet in late  April.    Hata told Nakauchi, who is also chairman and president of  Daiei Inc., the supermarket chain, that he hopes to promote  deregulation through the initiatives of his cabinet rather than  the bureaucracy.    Earlier in the day, executive members of Keidanren took part  in an administration reform promotion meeting, chaired by  Nakauchi. The meeting was attended by Chief Cabinet Secretary  Hiroshi Kumagai.    In the meeting, Keidanren submitted to Kumagai a letter  urging the government to promote deregulation.    Kumagai said Hata's administration will make efforts to  carry  out deregulation from the viewpoint of improving consumers'  daily life.    Hata's cabinet held its first meeting on government  deregulation plans on the day, government sources said. The  meeting was held to promote easing regulations, which have been  cited by the United States as trade barriers, they said.    The cabinet wants to take the initiative on easing  regulations as ministries and agencies concerned have been  dragging their feet on the issue, the sources said.</p>

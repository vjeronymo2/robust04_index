			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sale date set for Cerro Verde mine STATE-OWNED Minero Peru has set September 10 as the date for the sale of its Cerro Verde copper mine, a 'world-class deposit' that has attracted keen interest among top international companies, according to Mr Raul Otero, the company's president, Reuter reports from Lima. Distribution of the privatisation rules to the 19 mining companies prequalified to bid for Peru's fourth most important copper mine was to begin this week, he said. The minimum price and minimum investment requirement for Cerro Verde, 1,000km south of Lima in the southern region of Arequipa, would be announced a month before the sale, Mr Otero added. 'We have yet to fix the minimum price and we still have to determine how we'll fix the minimum investment because we need to look at the alternatives and what is acceptable for us,' he said.</p>

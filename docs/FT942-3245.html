			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Markets Report: Dollar remains weak Anxiety about the progress of the US-Japanese trade talks drove the dollar lower yesterday on the foreign exchanges, while the D-Mark continued to gain strength in the aftermath of the European elections, writes Graham Bowley. The dollar fell against the yen, in spite of the intervention by the Bank of Japan to support the US currency. The D-Mark's buoyancy, arising from Chancellor Helmut Kohl's strong performance in the European elections, exerted downward pressure on other European currencies. The dollar recovered some ground in later trade after remarks from Mr Lawrence Lindsey, a member of the Federal Reserve Board, that the US economy is 'in the midst of a solid expansion'. But analysts said the downside potential for the dollar remained. The US currency largely ignored the main data releases yesterday, the US consumer price index and retail sales for May, which came in much in line with expectations. US consumer prices rose 0.2 per cent in May, above April's 0.1 per cent increase. Retail sales fell 0.2 per cent in May, the second monthly decline in a row. 'There are signs that consumer activity in the second quarter has moderated a little, but the US economy is still growing robustly. This is not evidence of a slowdown,' said Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International in London. 'What has been depressing the dollar is the increasingly aggressive rhetoric on the US trade position with Japan.' Mr Jeremy Hawkins, chief economist at Bank of America, said: 'Recent comments from the US authorities that they are happy with the dollar at its present levels may mean that they will not be inclined to intervene if it falls further.' The Canadian dollar weakened yesterday. The Bank of Canada was reported to have intervened to buy the Canadian currency for US dollars as it fell to a low of CDollars 1.3875 in early trade. The US currency closed in London at Y102.665, against Y103.145 on Monday, and at DM1.6443, from DM1.65. In New York it finished at Y102.73 and DM1.6461. Sterling maintained its level against the US dollar yester-day but weakened moderately against the D-Mark as traders remained nervous about the UK political environment. Analysts said the pound was also weighed down by the dollar's fall against the D-Mark. Investors have been unnerved by talk of tax cuts to boost the Conservative party's standing following its poor performance in the European elections and UK by-elections. 'Tax cuts would be seen as a panic reaction to events and would not smack of good economic management,' said Mr Hannah. The pound lost about a pfennig to finish at DM2.4951 in London, against DM2.5061 on Monday. It was little changed against the dollar at Dollars 1.5175, from Dollars 1.5189. Attention today will be turned towards the UK chancellor's Mansion House speech and important economic data, including the latest labour market statistics and the May retail price index. The data will be scrutinised for any sign of a pick-up in inflation. A rise in the average earnings figure, currently at 4 per cent, could have a significant impact on the market. In the UK money markets, the Bank of England provided liquidity of Pounds 320m after forecasting a shortage of Pounds 300m. Overnight money traded between 4 1/2 and 3 1/2 per cent. The December contract on the UK futures market closed at 93.72 from 93.67, discounting a short-term interest rate of more than 6 1/4 per cent. Most other European currencies were depressed by the general strength of the D-Mark and by their own political uncertainties following the European elections. Both the French franc and the Spanish peseta continued to suffer from their governments' poor showing in the elections. But in Italy, the lira was pushed down by fears that the recent constitutional court ruling ordering the government to pay trillions of lira in back pensions would further worsen the deficit. The Greek drachma was pushed lower by data showing a rise in the Greek annual inflation rate to 11 per cent in May and fears that, with the elections over, the government will be under less pressure to support the currency. The Bank of Portugal intervened successfully to defend its currency. But the Swedish krona fell sharply in early trading, led by weakness in the Swedish and other European bond markets. It recovered some losses later in the day. The Dutch central bank surprised the markets with a 10 basis-point cut in its special advance rate to 4.90 per cent. It said the reduction was justified by the strength of the guilder. Analysts were surprised that the cut came before the Bundesbank's money market operations today. The Bundesbank announced that it was setting a tender for 14-day repo funds at variable bid rates. Dealers said they expected an announcement today of a 5 basis-point reduction in the repo rate to 5.05 per cent from 5.10 per cent.</p>

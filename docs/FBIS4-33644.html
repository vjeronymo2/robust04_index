			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Marta Salomon and Guilherme Evelin] </F>   [Text] Brasilia, 7 Jun (AE) -- Union Force secretary  general Emilson Simoes de Moura, nicknamed Alemao, today joined  the campaign command of presidential candidate Fernando Henrique  Cardoso. Alemao promised to obtain the support of 800 unions  affiliated with Union Force, which is led by Luiz Antonio de  Medeiros, the Popular Party's candidate for governor of Sao  Paulo State. Union Force has chosen not to lend its support to  any one candidate.    Alemao said: "I feel absolutely comfortable with the  coalition and with [former Bahia Governor] Antonio Carlos  Magalhaes, who is a democrat and who is altogether different  from those Stalinists and Lula supporters who advocate crime as  an instrument of political struggle." Alemao believes that if  Lula is elected there will be no investments in the country to  create jobs. "It will bring tragic consequences for all  workers," he said.    Endorsing the principles of the Brazilian Social Democracy  Party-Liberal Front Party-Brazilian Labor Party coalition,  Alemao defends the internationalization of the Brazilian  economy. He said: "This is why we are against Lula." Alemao is  in favor of ending the state monopoly of oil and of privatizing  state-owned companies.    Alemao's first suggestion to Cardoso is to increase the goal  of creating 8 million jobs during his four-year tenure. "That  is not enough," Alemao said. He refused to admit that the  economic stabilization program promoted by Cardoso will worsen  unemployment in the country. He said: "One cannot state that  the Real Plan is provoking unemployment."    Although confirming that unions affiliated with Union Force  will support Cardoso, Alemao made it clear that Cardoso will not  use its facilities in his campaign. "We have sound trucks, but  Cardoso will not use them," he said, criticizing once again the  involvement of CUT [Sole Workers Center] affiliated unions in  Lula's campaign. He said: "CUT has been completely overtaken."    Asked if he would hold the post of labor minister if Cardoso  wins the election, Alemao said he would rather take the reins of  the economy. He said jokingly: "I would prefer to be the  finance minister." Cardoso declined to comment on this issue.  He said: "I will not discuss the formation of my cabinet at  this time."</p>

			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Patients' Charter 'not up to its job' THE National Consumer Council, a government-funded watchdog, says in a report published today that the Patient's Charter is inadequate and needs strengthening. The charter is at the heart of government plans to improve the National Health Service, but the council says patients were not consulted when it was compiled. The council calls for additional rights for patients with independent inspection to monitor performance, and makes several complaints about the charter: It says the government has watered down the promise in the Citizen's Charter to provide 'good quality care' - the Patient's Charter makes no reference to quality. Basic rights are left out - for example to choose a doctor or hospital. The views of patients are ignored in setting and monitoring standards. The only measurable standards in the charter are limited to waiting times, for example, for an ambulance or for treatment once diagnosed. Other standards should be set, the council says. Quality Standards in the NHS. National Consumer Council, 20 Grosvenor Gardens, London SW1W ODH. Pounds 2.50.</p>

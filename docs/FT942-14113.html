			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / International Company News: Cost-cutting behind rise at AT&amp;T AT&amp;T, the US telecommunications group, yesterday reported a 16.9 per cent increase in first-quarter net income. It attributed the result to growth in long-distance services and equipment manufacturing, as well as cost-controls. The largest US long-distance company produced net income of Dollars 1.09bn, or 80 cents a share, compared with Dollars 936m, or 69 cents, in the same period of last year, before special accounting charges. The figures, struck on revenues which rose 5.3 per cent to Dollars 16.56bn, were slightly ahead of the mean Wall Street forecast, which was for earnings of 79 cents a share. Mr Robert Allen, chairman, told the annual meeting he was 'particularly encouraged by some of the underlying trends because I believe they bode well for the rest of the year'. The meeting voted to change the group's name to AT&amp;T from American Telephone &amp; Telegraph. The group's core long-distance business, which is embroiled in a fierce battle for market share, saw calling volume grow 7 per cent, while revenues rose 3 per cent to Dollars 10.22bn. Important factors behind this were the improving US economy and AT&amp;T's aggressive new consumer marketing campaign, 'True Rewards'. Long-distance margins were 38.8 per cent, up nearly 2 percentage points on the same period of 1993. In products and systems, revenues grew more than 14 per cent to Dollars 4.07bn. Communications products for consumers and businesses led the improvement, with double digit growth. 'Sales of cellular, corded and cordless telephones, as well as private telephone systems for small and medium-sized businesses and submarine cable systems were particularly strong,' AT&amp;T said. Sales of network equipment - bought mainly by telephone service companies - rose 11 per cent to Dollars 1.95bn. However, AT&amp;T's computer business - formerly known as NCR - reported a loss of Dollars 57m, up from Dollars 14m a year ago. This was blamed on price competition and the impact of a restructuring which began at the end of last year. Product sales were up 5 per cent. The group's revenues from financial services, spearheaded by its AT&amp;T credit card, rose 21 per cent to Dollars 691m. Mr Allen told the annual meeting cost-cutting had helped AT&amp;T achieve its goal of at least 10 per cent earnings growth recently.</p>

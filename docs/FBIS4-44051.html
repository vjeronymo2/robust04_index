			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin has described his  country's cooperation with Europe as a historic agreement of  mutual benefit. The protocol of cooperation will be signed  tomorrow. Correspondent Fotis Kafarakis reports:    [Begin recording] [Kafarakis] For Russia, Corfu is another  stop in its course toward Europe. Following the signing of the  agreement with NATO, an agreement that for many sealed the end  of the Cold War period, the Russian Federation aims to find in  the Europe of the Sixteen the ally who will help it get out of  its financial deadlock.    [Yeltsin, in Russian with Greek translation in subtitles]  When this agreement is completed, Russia will be given a way  out. A new market opens up for the Russian economy and we will  become equal partners for the mutual benefit of both sides.    [Kafarakis] The historic agreement provides for a reduction  of trade taxes and opens the road for negotiations after 1998  for the establishment of a free trade zone. It also gives a  push to economic cooperation, exchanges of products and  services, and political dialogue.    [Yeltsin, in Russian with Greek translation in subtitles] I  am grateful to Greece, which presides over the European Union,  for everything that has happened in the past few weeks.

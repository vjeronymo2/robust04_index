			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Embattled Yeltsin braves anger over Baltic troops MR Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, yesterday refused to rule out direct presidential rule to control the steadily rising political tension. Meanwhile Baltic leaders bitterly attacked his decision on Thursday to halt withdrawal of Russian troops from the Baltics, charging that his decree was a sign of 'political instability' in Russia. A spokesman for the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation in Brussels said that the decree was a 'matter for concern' and urged 'no further delay' in the pullout of the troops. The troop levels in the Baltics stood at 130,000 earlier this year, but some tens of thousands have been withdrawn. Mr Vitaly Churkin, a Russian deputy foreign minister, said that social and economic issues had to be sorted out before the rest of the troops left. Mr Yeltsin's decree said that the human rights issues were a matter of concern for the Russian government: most ethnic Russians were debarred from voting in the recent Estonian elections because of language and citizenship laws, while neighbouring Latvia also has high linguistic and residential requirements, More weighty, however, has been the flat refusal of the Baltic-based officers, strongly backed by the top echelons of the army, to leave their billets for homelessness in Russia. President Yeltsin, increasingly embattled, depends upon the support of his generals - a support which has pointedly been made overt in the past week. Mr Andrejs Krestins, deputy president of Latvia, said that 'you have to be aware that this unstable Russian position puts in danger not only the Baltics but also the whole of Europe, especially when national radicals with imperial ideas are fighting for power inside Russia'. Mr Yeltsin, on a tour of the southern city of Astrakhan, said in answer to reporters' questions that presidential rule, which some advisers have urged upon him, would 'violate the constitution' but added, ambiguously, that 'I took my oath to the people first and the rest came later'. He promised price stabilisation in December or January, the latest of a series of promises of better economic times, none of which have been fulfilled. He said that the Front for National Salvation, which he banned earlier this week, was a 'very dangerous organisation' - an estimation backed by Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting prime minister, who said that the threat to democracy from the left and right extremes was very grave.</p>

			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Italy plays by new rules - A code of conduct to police the bidding procedures for state advertising contracts has received a mixed reception Shaken by the involvement of some of their most prominent members in alleged kickbacks to politicians, in return for public-sector campaigns, Italy's leading advertising agencies have drawn up a new code of conduct to protect against future abuses. But some advertising executives fear the new rules, which will create a supervisory body to police bidding procedures for the contracts, could stifle, rather than encourage, competition. And not all are convinced that self-regulation and more open bidding are enough to regulate Italy's advertising industry. 'The aim is to create a level playing field,' says Alberto Contri, chairman of the association of leading agencies. Contri, elected chairman earlier this year, speaks with some authority. Medicus Intercon-Feel Good, the agency he runs, specialises in publicity for the pharmaceutical and health sectors, where most of the alleged abuses occurred. The new code of practice aims to remove any scope for corruption by ensuring that all future state advertising campaigns be solicited exclusively through public tenders. It has already attracted attention in other countries where uncompetitive business practices, such as 'voluntary' contributions to a politician's electoral expenses, are believed to take place. Foreign interest has been reinforced by the arrests of executives at Italian subsidiaries of at least two of the world's leading agencies. Even more embarrassing for the agencies is that the inquiries, which relate to alleged kickbacks to win business in the health ministry's big anti-Aids campaign, involve such a sensitive health issue. The allegations emerged last month after Giovanni Marone, secretary to a former health minister under investigation for alleged political corruption, began to reveal to magistrates how some ministerial advertising contracts were won. According to Marone, whose testimony has been widely leaked, some agencies paid hundreds of millions of lire to Francesco De Lorenzo, Italy's former health minister. Disguised as 'campaign contributions', the payments were actually kickbacks to win lucrative public sector advertising contracts. De Lorenzo, who resigned earlier this year after being put under investigation for an alleged jobs-for-votes scam in his native Naples, is now being investigated for a much wider range of allegations of political corruption, including kickbacks from some of Italy's leading drugs companies. Marone's revelations led to a string of arrests in the advertising industry. Those involved included the former and current managing directors of the Italian subsidiary of Young and Rubicam; Claudio Maria Masi de Vargas Macciucca, the managing director of Publicis FCB MAC Italy, the Italian joint venture of Foote, Cone &amp; Belding and Publicis of France; two directors of Armando Testa, a Milan-based agency, and an employee of DAPS, a local media buyer. Enforcement of the new code of practice is to be supervised by a special committee, comprising judges and senior advertising and public relations executives. Agencies will be required to inform their trade association what tenders they intend to bid for, and the supervisory committee will examine all tenders to ensure they are suitably transparent. Should an agency suspect a contract is being awarded unfairly, it must denounce the proposed campaign to the supervisory body. The same applies in cases where some of the terms, such as abnormally short preparation periods to submit proposals, suggest the bid might be rigged. The aim, according to Contri, is to ensure contracts are won on the basis of 'real factors, such as professional competence, experience and the nature of the services offered'. But do the rules go far enough to stamp out malpractice? Public tendering has been proposed as a panacea in other Italian industries, such as construction, where it is alleged that big kickbacks are regularly paid to politicians to win business. 'Public tenders may help to eradicate malpractice in industries, such as building, where the bidding criteria are relatively clear and contracts can be allocated on objective grounds, such as cost,' says one prominent advertising executive. 'But it's harder to apply the same standards to advertising.' Another observer warns that even public tenders can be rigged. 'If enough people want to cheat the system, they can do it,' he says. The new rules should at least stamp out some of the most shocking excesses of the past, such as limited private tenders, with the winner decided in advance. They should also eliminate the so-called 'public' bids, where odd rules, such as abnormally short preparation times, may have masked similar malpractices. Whether they will be enough is still not certain.</p>

			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Capital restructure for NSM NSM, the heavily-indebted international coal mining group, yesterday announced plans for a capital reorganisation. It also reported a Pounds 5.7m loss before tax for the year to end March compared with previous profits of Pounds 3.7m. The loss was inflated by a Pounds 3.4m exceptional item relating to the rescission of a land sale contract. Preference and ordinary dividends are being passed - in the previous financial year ordinary dividends totalled 0.5p. Losses per share of 0.44p compared with earnings of 0.84p. A proposed equity restructuring, which will give preference shareholders 80 per cent of the new share capital, will be put to an extraordinary general meeting. Group borrowings fell from Pounds 95m to Pounds 87m against shareholders' funds of Pounds 50m. The group said it was planning to dispose of further non-core businesses worth between Pounds 15m to Pounds 20m. Last year it sold Bison, its building materials arm, for Pounds 30.7m. Extraordinary items of Pounds 89.2m related mainly to goodwill that arose on the purchase of Bison and its subsidiaries. The loss does not affect net assets because the goodwill was originally written-off at the time of purchase. The group's annual interest charge increased to Pounds 11.2m (Pounds 9m) since the Bison sale was only completed in December. Mr John Jermine, chief executive, said: 'We are now a coal mining business in the UK and the US. There will not be any more diversification into other areas.' The group is hoping to benefit from the government's planned privatisation of British Coal. Mr Jermine said he would be asking ministers to end the Pounds 5 a ton royalty payment to BC. Operating profits fell from Pounds 12.8m to Pounds 9m on turnover of Pounds 147.3m (Pounds 185.9m). The UK mining division, which is one of the country's largest opencast coal contractors, generated revenues of Pounds 63.5m (Pounds 54.5m). The US coal division sold 3m tons of coal compared to 2.8m tons.</p>

			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Revenue's stand hits varsity BES issues THE INLAND Revenue does not like business expansion scheme companies which invest in university accommodation. As reported last week, its reaction to the Johnson Fry companies which bought accommodation for University College, London, suggests it is getting tougher as the BES nears its scheduled demise. The Revenue has interpreted the BES legislation in such a way that tax relief would be denied, according to Johnson Fry's chairman, Charles Fry. But this decision is not final and talks continue. Johnson Fry argues that the decision to make a summer letting, which caused the problem, was not the responsibility of the BES companies but of UCL, and that the legislation refers only to matters under the control of the BES company. It will pay the costs of any legal action, but it is worth noting that sponsors do not guarantee that BES relief is available - although they do undertake to act for investors in trying to ensure that it is. The main lesson of the affair, according to John Spiers of BESt Investment, is to avoid schemes where money is raised before the Revenue has granted provisional approval. Whatever the Revenue's final decision, it has succeeded in cutting back on university BES issues - Ian Pugh of Allenbridge says three have been cancelled in the past week. Meanwhile, BES companies proliferate. The following list, provided by Allenbridge, shows only those with a contracted exit: Airways III offers a Pounds 1.17 buy-back price after five years for every Pounds 1 invested now. Buy-back comes from the Airways Housing Association. A Priori Growth, sponsored by Neill Clerk, will buy repossessions for the Britannia building society. Non-recourse loans are available for 74p per Pounds 1 invested after six months, 78.31p after one year, 87.71p after two years and 98.24p after three. There is no guarantee after 5 years. Barratt Fixed Growth fund, sponsored by Capital for Companies and underwritten by Lloyds Bank, has a five-year buy-back of 115p. BESSA Bristol &amp; West, sponsored by Close Brothers, buys repossessions for Bristol &amp; West building society. Non-recourse loans of 74p after six months are available, with a repayment of 105p per share after five years. BESSA Cambridge, sponsored by Close Brothers and underwritten by Barclays, will buy accommodation for Newnham College, Cambridge. Six-month loans of 75p, and a five-year buy-back price of 110.6p per Pounds 1, are available. Bulldog Premium Growth, sponsored by Charterhouse Tilney, will buy accommodation for Bellway Homes. Non-recourse loans of 75p per Pounds 1 are available from Barclays. Buy-back after five years is 112p per Pounds 1. Govett Asset Builder IV will buy housing for Sanctuary Housing. Five-year buy-back is 115p. Homeshare, sponsored by National Westminster and Hambros banks, will buy houses from NatWest. Six-month loans of 74p, and a five-year buy-back of Pounds 1.08, are available. Homes for Littlehampton, sponsored by Matrix-Securities, has a 5-year buy-back of 117p. House The Homeless V buys accommodation for the Peabody Trust. 5-year buy-back is 115p.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The petition and available evidence indicated that retention of the 7.8 psi standard would impose significant cost on consumers and industry and that the 7.8 psi standard is not necessary in the short-term given the current transitional status of the Denver-Boulder area and the area's record of continued attainment of the ozone standard. Although Colorado has not submitted additional analysis regarding the costs of implementing a 7.8 psi RVP standard, EPA believes the cost analysis it performed based on Colorado's original 1991 petition is still applicable. That analysis indicated that a $3,500,000 to $4,000,000 savings would be realized in the Denver-Boulder area during the summer ozone season. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 16 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As discussed in the May 29, 1991 notice EPA estimates that a relaxation of the 7.8 psi standard to 9.0 psi will result in a savings of approximately 1.1 cents per gallon. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 17 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  EPA believes, therefore, that retention of the 7.8 psi standard would impose significant costs on consumers and industry relative to a 9.0 psi standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 16 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> A detailed analysis of the costs associated with the RVP program in Colorado can be found in air docket A&hyph;92&hyph;08 created for the proposal to grant Colorado's petition for relaxation for 1992 and 1993. 57 FR 20234 (May 12, 1992).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 17 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 56 FR 24246 (May 29, 1991).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Moreover, EPA agrees with Colorado that the Denver-Boulder area will not need a 7.8 psi standard in the next two years to comply with the ozone NAAQS. The area has not violated the standard since 1986. Since this time summertime gasoline volatility was reduced significantly through the implementation of the Phase I and Phase II of the federal RVP standards. Although EPA believes that a short term relaxation of the RVP standard will not cause a violation of the ozone NAAQS in the Denver-Boulder area, EPA is concerned regarding the area's long term compliance. The Denver-Boulder area's growing population and increase in vehicle miles travelled generate questions regarding whether sufficient controls are available to provide for maintenance of the ozone NAAQS over the long term. Moreover, the area did experience single exceedances during the 1993 ozone season at two monitoring stations and has experienced other readings near or above 0.120 in recent years. Therefore, the long-term maintenance of the standard in the Denver-Boulder areas is in question.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, Colorado has failed to develop a maintenance plan for the Denver-Boulder area, despite its commitment to do so by June, 1993 in the original request for relaxation of the RVP standard in Denver-Boulder during 1992 and 1993. EPA granted Colorado's original request for relaxation with the expectation that the state would submit an ozone maintenance plan by this date. Colorado's failure has left EPA with no assurance that the Denver-Boulder area will be able to maintain its compliance with the ozone NAAQS for the next ten years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of the area's classification as transitional, EPA was required to determine by June 30, 1992 whether the area had in fact attained the ozone standard by December 31, 1991. If the Administrator determined that the area had attained the standard, the state was required to submit, within twelve months of the determination, a maintenance plan meeting the requirements of section 175A of the Act. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 18 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Thomas Getz, Director of the APCD has submitted a letter to EPA that asserts that the ozone maintenance plan has been delayed because of serious staff resource constraints caused by projects of higher priority, including the PM 10 and CO SIPs. The letter states that the PM 10 and CO SIPs are subject to potential sanctions and that the state has been working to address the statutorily mandated deadlines for these plans. As the Denver-Boulder area has not experienced an ozone violation in recent years, the APCD believed the completion of the ozone SIP to be less urgent than the completion of the other plans. In addition, data necessary to complete baseline emissions inventories was not available for use in the plan. This memo has been placed in the docket for this rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 18 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> On October 22, 1992, EPA Region VIII sent a letter to Governor Romer stating that the Denver-Boulder transitional area had not violated the ozone NAAQS during the period from January 1, 1987 to December 31, 1991.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Despite these limitations, however, Colorado has committed to developing a maintenance plan for ozone to be submitted by early 1995. Through this plan, the state will determine what additional control measures, if any, will be necessary to provide for continued attainment of the ozone NAAQS. The maintenance plan must show that the ozone standard will be maintained for a period of at least ten years. The development of this maintenance plan will give Colorado an opportunity to conduct a comprehensive air quality modeling exercise to determine what control measures will be necessary to provide for long term maintenance of the ozone NAAQS. Along with the existing SIP measures, tighter gasoline volatility and other strategies will be evaluated to determine the most appropriate and cost-effective strategy for maintaining the NAAQS. Today's action should provide Colorado with sufficient time to complete an ozone maintenance plan. Moreover, ongoing vehicle fleet turnover, as well as several new requirements of the Clean Air Act Amendments (such as tighter tailpipe standards, longer useful life definitions, on-board diagnostic and refueling equipment, and enhanced inspection and maintenance requirements) are likely to lead to reduction in overall mobile source emissions of VOCs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the maintenance plan is being developed, EPA believes that air quality will be protected by the ongoing control programs. The volatility standard for Denver-Boulder will drop to 7.8 psi in 1996 unless additional action by the Commission and the Governor, backed by a comprehensive maintenance plan, is taken to extend the 9.0 psi standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Direct Final Rulemaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This action is being taken without prior proposal because EPA believes that this relaxation in the RVP regulation is noncontroversial; the effect of this rulemaking is limited to the Denver-Boulder, Colorado nonattainment area; and EPA anticipates no significant comments on this action. This action represents a continuation of a previously approved relaxation in the RVP standard and will provide Colorado the necessary time to complete an ozone maintenance plan at which time a long term projection will be made regarding the need for a more stringent RVP standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This action will be effective 60 days from the date of this  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice, unless notice is received within 30 days of today's notice that someone wishes to submit adverse or critical comments. If such notice is received, this action will be withdrawn and two subsequent notices will be published. One notice, which will be published before the effective date, will withdraw the final action. Another notice will begin a new rulemaking by announcing a proposal of the action and establishing a comment period. Interested persons are invited to submit comments on this proposed approval. EPA will consider all comments received within thirty days of the publication of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consequently, this procedure still allows the opportunity for public comment and opportunity for oral presentation of data that is required under CAA section 307(d). This procedure merely provides an expedited procedure for final action where a rulemaking is not expected to be controversial and no adverse comment is expected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / International Company News: Procter acts to defend sales with price cuts Procter &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products group, yesterday announced sharp cuts in the prices of two of its biggest-selling healthcare products in an attempt to defend them against competition from other brands and own-label goods. The reductions are the latest in a series of price-cutting moves by Procter &amp; Gamble, in response to the continuing pressure on branded goods from lower-priced competition, particularly in the US. The products affected are Metamucil, the best-selling fibre laxative in the US, and Scope, the best-selling mouthwash in the US after Warner &amp; Lambert's Listerine. Metamucil's price will fall by an average of 20 per cent and Scope's by an average of 16 per cent.</p>

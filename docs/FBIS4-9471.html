			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, April 25 -- The visit to be paid by  President Lech Walesa to Lithuania on April 26-27 will close the  process of normalisation of Poland's relations with her closest  neighbours. Lithuania is the only country with which Poland has  not signed a new treaty so far, Presidential Spokesman Andrzej  Drzycimski said Monday [25 April].    The presidents of Poland and Lithuania will sign a treaty on  "friendly relations and good-neighbourly cooperation" on the  first day of the visit. The visit is also important because of  its psychological aspect: it is to overcome the domination of  the past and history over the present and future relations  between the two countries," Drzycimski added.    "The treaty is an expression of a compromise and political  realism of the two sides. Poland and Lithuania found themselves  in a new world, a new Europe and a new geopolitical situation.  Good relations are necessary for both sides. The treaty  carries the hope and awareness that cooperation will bring  benefits and perhaps will help avoid potential threats," head of  the presidential political office, Andrzej Zakrzewski said. He  added that Lithuania, which strives to cooperate with the  Visegrad Triangle and feels to be a part of central Europe,  needs Poland. Likewise, Poland needs Lithuania, Zakrzewski said  and stressed that "this is a strategic foundation of a new  geopolitics of the regions of the two countries."    According to the Polish Foreign Ministry, the  Polish-Lithuanian treaty creates a solid foundation for the  normalisation of mutual relations also as regards the issue of  minorities. Also, by signing the treaty with Lithuania Poland  will be included in a network of regional links creating new  political and economic prospects.    Stefan Meller of the Department of Europe at the Polish  Foreign Ministry claims the treaty is concordant with respective  international standards. Under the treaty, both signatories  have the duty to respect human rights.    Meller said that the implementation of the treaty might call  for changes in the internal legislation of the two states.    The text of the treaty continues to arouse controversy both  in Poland and Lithuania, but nobody in Lithuania denies the fact  that the two countries need the document of this rank and that  the Polish president's visit to Vilnius is much desired, PAP  correspondent in Vilnius, Alina kurkus wrote.    Economic problems are also to be tackled during the visit.  After a dramatic collapse of economic relations between Poland  and Lithuania, caused by the systemic changes in the two  countries, economic contacts at present aim at normalisation.  Poland is 6th among Lithuania's trading partners, and the value  of the Polish-Lithuanian turnover during 10 months of last year  ammounted to some 100 million dollars. According to Poland,  there are possibilities to increase mutual turnover, expecially  in agriculture, the construction and timber industry and  maritime economy.    during his 32-hour stay in Lithuania Walesa will meet twice  with President Algirdas Brazauskas. He will also meet with  Chairman of the Lithuanian Sejm (parliament), Ceslovas Jursenas,  and Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius, and address the Sejm on  Tuesday. A joint press conference of the two presidents is  scheduled for Wednesday.</p>

			<p><P> April 21, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BRADLEY BUDGET AIDS WATER, REDEVELOPMENT, POLICE  </P> <P> Mayor Tom Bradley's proposed 1990-91 budget for the city of Los Angeles calls  for several large expenditures in the San Fernando Valley, including $33.5  million for expansion of the Donald C. Tillman Water Reclamation plant and  $14.5 million for continuation of the North Hollywood Redevelopment Plan.  </P> <P> Also among the major Valley proposals are $3.7 million for improvement of three  Valley police stations, $2.2 million for construction of a senior citizens  center in Pacoima and about $14.9 million in additional costs related to  changes at Lopez Canyon Landfill, the city-operated dump above Lake View  Terrace.  </P> <P> The budget will be reviewed and debated by the City Council in hearings  scheduled to begin Monday.  </P> <P> The Tillman sewage treatment plant, in Van Nuys, is being enlarged to reduce  the volume of sewage treated at the Hyperion Treatment Plant in Playa del Rey,  thus decreasing the chance for ocean-bound sewage spills.  </P> <P> Bradley is calling for completion by late 1991 of a dechlorination facility at  the Tillman plant, air pollution control equipment and a system for sending  treated water to Sepulveda Basin lakes. An additional 17 sanitation workers and  11 city engineers are included in the mayor's budget to carry out these  projects.  </P> <P> The 740-acre North Hollywood redevelopment district was created in 1979. The  project has been criticized by some local activists for favoring further  improvements of an upscale business and office development over rehabilitation  of houses. The mayor's budget calls for spending $14.5 million on the project  this year, up from $12.2 million in 1989-90.  </P> <P> The largest proposed expenditure at Lopez Canyon Landfill is intended to  fulfill a city agreement to limit the number of garbage trucks entering the  dump to 400 trucks daily. That agreement evolved from a state crackdown on dump  operations last year.  </P> <P> The mayor's budget calls for spending $7 million to transport the spillover  household trash, park trimmings and street sweeping debris to private  landfills. The budget also calls for spending $1.25 million to buy land around  the landfill that would form a partial buffer between the dump and residential  areas.  </P> <P> A Pacoima senior citizens center, which may be named for northeast Valley City  Councilman Ernani Bernardi, has been discussed for several years. The council  on Friday agreed to schedule public hearings to discuss buying land at 11266  Glenoaks Blvd. for the center.  </P> <P> Three Valley police stations have outgrown their facilities, according to  statements in the mayor's budget, and need $24.9 million to expand buildings  and add parking.  </P> <P> For the coming year, the mayor has proposed spending $3.7 million on the  stations, with the largest portion -- $2.9 million -- going to the North  Hollywood station for land purchase and building designs.  </P> <P> Two other stations, Foothill in Pacoima and West Valley in Reseda, would  receive $471,000 and $333,000, respectively, for architectural designs and  construction plans.  </P> <P> Other major Valley expenditures include:  </P> <P> * $23.3 million for Valley water and power projects, including construction of  a water well system in Tujunga, increased capacity of the North Hollywood water  sewer system and expansion of an electrical power conversion plant in Sylmar.  </P> <P> * $3.35 million for work at the Van Nuys Airport, including a $2.4-million  taxiway.  </P> <P> * About $2.4 million for improving library service to the Valley, including $1  million for expanding the Panorama City Branch Library.  </P> <P> * More than $2 million for improvement of various transit and transportation  services and studies ranging from a study of the impact of future growth on  Sunland/Tujunga traffic to an increase in dial-a-ride service from Sunland to  Sylmar.  </P> <P> * Nearly $2 million for resurfacing and adding lights to city-owned parking  lots in the Valley.  </P> <P> * $850,000 for renovation of the municipal building in Van Nuys, including  removal of asbestos and installation of fire sprinklers and disabled access.  </P> <P> </P> <P> * Complete Look at Budget A1  </P></p>

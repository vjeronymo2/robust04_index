			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / World News in Brief: London equities close on uncertain note The UK stock market ended a successful week with an uncertain session which left share prices little changed from the previous day. The FT-SE Index closed at 2,847, a net loss of 2.3. Over the week, the index has risen by 53.3 points as the government's misfortunes have been translated into hopes of a base rate cut.

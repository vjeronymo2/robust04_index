			<p>BFN     [Text] A Foreign Office spokesman said that there has been  no change in Pakistan's principled policy on the nuclear issue.  Clarifying a statement by Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad  Ali, the spokesman said that the press has attributed an  incorrect statement to him. The foreign minister said that the  United States proposed that if Pakistan agreed on a verifiable  restriction [bandish] on its nuclear program, then there will be  a one time exemption from the Pressler Amendment.    The foreign minister categorically reaffirmed the Pakistani  stand that Pakistan was ready to consider all proposals on  declaring South Asia a nuclear-free zone provided these  proposals were just and nondiscriminatory. The spokesman said  that the nuclear issue is an extremely sensitive one and a  national consensus on it is very essential. He expressed the  hope that the press will keep national interests in view and  refrain from out of context presentations of statements on this  most important issue.</p>

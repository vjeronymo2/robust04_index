			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Berisford to get Pounds 6m for Hunter Saphir Berisford International, the commodities and property group in the process of selling most of its businesses to repay debt, will receive Pounds 6.1m if Albert Fisher's Pounds 29m agreed bid for Hunter Saphir, the fresh produce group, goes through. When the cash from this sale, and others agreed but not yet completed, comes in, Berisford will have no net debt. At its peak, Berisford's debts totalled Pounds 1.2bn. The group is now looking for acquisitions. The Hunter Saphir bid gives Berisford a Pounds 2.1m profit on the carrying value of its stake in Hunter Saphir. Berisford holds 4.9m Hunter Saphir shares, which had been written down to nil, and 4m Pounds 1 preference shares.</p>

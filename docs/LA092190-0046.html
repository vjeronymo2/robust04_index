			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE BEAT: HAMPTON'S EARLY TREATISE ON THE BATTLES OF LOVE  </P> <P> Christopher Hampton is several playwrights in one. He writes of complex  political conundrums ("Savages," "The Portage to San Cristobal of A.H."). He  adapts, with finesse, foreign classics ("Tales From the Vienna Woods," "The  Wild Duck").  </P> <P> And he explores how people use each other in a sexual food chain ("Les Liaisons  Dangereuses," another adaptation). The progenitor of the sly "Liaisons" is  Hampton's 1976 play about contemporary young Londoners, "Treats," at the Rose  Theatre.  </P> <P> The prey is Ann, played with wavering accent but Glenda Jackson-like fortitude  by Lucy Boryer. She has discarded her rapacious boyfriend, Dave (Michael  Wallenstein), for a rather limp alternative named Patrick (Donald Robinson  Gordon). But only the strong survive in "Treats." Dave, never one to accept a  simple "no," verbally bullies Patrick into submission.  </P> <P> The tables are turned, with perfect Hampton symmetry, and Patrick becomes the  outsider trying to get back in. This is delicious sexual battling, even if the  young Hampton stacked the deck too neatly in Dave's favor. Patrick never has a  chance (Gordon lays his neuroses bare with delirious precision), though  Wallenstein's Dave isn't quite the gobbling big fish he should be. Ferdinand  Lewis' production, while only just competent, serves up "Treats" with all the  cynical trimmings intact.  </P> <P>  At 318 Lincoln Blvd., Venice, on Thursdays through Sundays, 8 p.m., until  Sept. 29. $12; (213) 288-6834.  </P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Devil's Advocate' at Celebration  </P> <P> Talk about cynical. Giancarlo Stampalia's "Devil's Advocate," at the  Celebration Theatre, takes Hollywood at face value -- as a town where the only  ones who matter are the ones who survive. The rest might as well be at the  bottom of the ocean.  </P> <P> That is where super-agent and lawyer Joseph Winterowd (Christopher Nixon) has  deposited one of his victims, but he is more accustomed to fashioning  associates' lives than he is to killing them. His big plans for future star  Gregory Dane (Kevin Kildow) include major billing and keeping Dane's gay life  style in the closet. Winterowd's trusty accomplice (Carolyn Kimball) provides  her less-than-zero daughter (Catherine Davis Cox) as Dane's wife. But  Winterowd's ex, Katherine (Sarah Lilly) is about to screw up the works.  </P> <P> Stampalia's formula is film noir, just as the formula for his previous  "Gentleman's Gentleman" was Wildean comedy. He's a good enough writer not to  need any form but his own, yet he revels in noir here, as if James M. Cain were  re-writing John Webster.  </P> <P> He directs that way, too: Few scenes are longer than a minute, but, thanks to a  disciplined pacing with sharp blackouts, they collectively build up a sense of  inescapable evil. Nixon has the surest grasp of this, while Kildow is an ideal  innocent. The women uneasily sway between campy and serious.  </P> <P>  At 426 N. Hoover St., on Sept. 25, Oct. 2-3, 9-10. $5; (213) 666-8669.  </P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Sunday Show' With The Groundlings  </P> <P> Like a ballclub with a major league outfit and a farm system to support it, The  Groundlings have a first team that plays prime time and a second unit on  Sundays. The idea is to groom the Sunday group before they move up the ladder.  </P> <P> But the current "Sunday Show" has it all over the Friday-Saturday "Full Frontal  Groundlings." Even with the usual caveat emptor -- that the line-up of skits  and improvs changes from week to week -- director Cathy Shambley's current  bunch of Groundlings is one of the best in some time.  </P> <P> For one thing, the evening relies on written, well-honed scenes, leaving the  brief improvs to the end. Things start off strong with "New Kids on the Eastern  Bloc" and stay strong. TV, as usual, is a big source: "Wide World of Sports"  anchors host a party as if they're still on the air; a product to promote chest  hair growth is pitched; a "Baywatch" lampoon "rescues" a female audience  member.  </P> <P> The show is also aware that there's life beyond TV: out-of work lawyers, like  undocumented workers, flag down clients on the street; stylish luncheoners  contend with enormous slices of watermelon; male and female celibates find true  love. This is a bright 14-member ensemble, but the guiding light is the  writing, led by Carolyn Omine, Michael Caldwell, Mike Hitchcock, Jim Wise and  Vic Wilson.  </P> <P>  At 7307 Melrose Ave., on Sundays, 7:30 p.m., indefinitely. $11; (213)  934-9700.  </P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Double Double' at Tiffany Theatre  </P> <P> L.A. has its trademark TV-oriented theater, New York has its trademark  overproduced, empty extravaganzas, and London's West End has its trademark  actor-oriented genre pieces. "Sleuth" is an example, and "Double Double," by  Eric Elice and actor Roger Rees, is "Sleuth's" banal stepchild.  </P> <P> The only reason a show like this exists is to make money, but the unevenness of  Claudia A. Weitsman's Tiffany Theatre production makes you wonder if that can  happen. The heart of the problem is Nicole Orth-Pallavicini as a just-widowed  woman who claims to a picked-up stranger (Rudolph Willrich) that she needs him  to stand in for her dead husband so she can collect on his trust fund.  </P> <P> What's the problem? Orth-Pallavicini can't make her widow sound the least bit  sincere, undercutting the plot's credibility at every turn. Several turns  later, even the plot goes blotto as Elice and Rees desperately try to wrap  things up. David Scaglione's set shakes a lot from the action, but Willrich  stands his ground as a man of surprising cleverness.  </P> <P>  At 8532 Sunset Blvd., on Thursdays through Sundays, 8 p.m., until Oct. 7. $20;  (213) 289-2999.  </P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> 7 Characters an Hour in 'Crying Out Loud'  </P> <P> Is an hour enough time for one actor to dig inside seven distinct characters?  Madeleine Comora's and Mariangela Pino's "For Crying Out Loud" suggests not;  but as actress Pino announced before the performance, she and Comora are asking  for audience comments.  </P> <P> So it's still in progress, like these women. Except for Margaret, an  Englishwoman obsessed with death and disaster, and Alyce, a homeless Vietnam  War veteran, they're profiles in courage -- or at least a courageous exterior.  </P> <P> Pino is best at allowing the tough mask to fall away to show the underlying  loneliness or hurt. She can cover a range of dialects, though the sheer number  of them threatens to turn the show into a showcase. Comora and Pino, with  director Aled Davies, need to decide which women to flesh out more, and which  to leave aside for another play.  </P> <P>  At 1455 N. Gordon, on Sept. 23, 10:30 p.m.; Sept. 24 and 30, 8 p.m.; Mondays,  8:30 p.m. (starting Oct. 1), indefinitely. $10; (213) 957-1335.  </P> <P> </P></p>

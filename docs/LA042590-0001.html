			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ENCINITAS CALLS FOR EMERGENCY MIGRANT HELP  </P> <P> The City Council on Tuesday night made this the first community in California  to declare a state of local emergency after failing to independently solve its  migrant laborer problem.  </P> <P> "I think it's obvious that this is a situation well beyond our ability to  control," City Manager Warren Shafer told the council. "We're looking to call  attention and get the support of the players who have an opportunity to get  something done here."  </P> <P> The declaration calls for the federal government to allot more resources to the  U.S. Border Patrol and Immigration and Naturalization Service as well as  provide jobs, education and emergency housing for an estimated 800 to 1,500  homeless migrants living within its city limits.  </P> <P> The document also calls on Rep. Ron Packard (R-Oceanside) and the rest of the  San Diego congressional delegation to conduct hearings in San Diego County on  how the immigration flow from Mexico and Latin America is affecting the region.  </P> <P> Among a list of 21 reasons for calling a state of emergency was the constant  presence of undocumented workers who solicit work from parking lots and street  corners, "creating traffic congestion, safety hazards, litter and disrupting  business."  </P> <P> Of particular concern are more than 680 Guatemalan refugees granted permission  to live in the United States while seeking political asylum, but who cannot yet  legally join the work force, city officials said.  </P> <P> Until recently, many of the Guatemalans had camped behind a Big Bear market,  but the city recently enacted security patrols to drive them away.  </P> <P> On Tuesday night, Encinitas' five City Council members took turns criticizing  the federal government's immigration policies.  </P> <P> "It's obvious to me the U.S. government by its actions in Central America and  by its omission in not defining its border policy has created a no-border  policy," said Councilman Rick Shea.  </P> <P> He said he is dumbfounded by federal plans to increase the number of lanes at  the San Onofre check point rather than committing its resources to the San  Ysidro border crossing.  </P> <P> That decision, he said, put the North County in a precarious position.  </P> <P> "We're living in some sort of DMZ -- somewhere between an imaginary border and  a concrete border," he said. "The federal government's policies have created  great numbers of poor people wandering from city to city in the North County. A  state of emergency does exist. I'd like to accomplish one simple thing here  tonight to get the federal government to do their job so we can do ours."  </P> <P> Earlier in the day, however, several council members doubted that the city can  get the attention of the entire Congress over what many representatives  consider to be a regional issue.  </P> <P> "We're trying anything we can," said Gloria Carranza, the city's transients  issue coordinator who co-authored the resolution. "We're hoping to call  attention and increase public awareness in places we haven't reached yet,  namely much of Capitol Hill.  </P> <P> "We want the Congress to hold hearings in the North County to see for  themselves just what impact this immigration is having on the entire  Southwest."  </P> <P> John Weil, an aide to Rep. Packard, delivered a prepared statement from the  politician.  </P> <P> "Without question, our region is one of the hardest hit by immigration in the  country. This issue has plagued Southern California for decades, and had defied  our best efforts to solve it," he said.  </P> <P> "Migrants with no place to live and no place to go have strained local  resources. And, at the same time, they have gained the sympathies of the  residents of our district -- myself included."  </P> <P> Packard explained in the statement that he had been assured by immigration  officials that 200 new Border Patrol agents had been requested and many of them  would be assigned to San Diego, in proportion with the area's needs.  </P> <P> But he also had a warning for Encinitas officials in declaring a local state of  emergency.  </P> <P> "Congress has shown little or no interest in addressing this as a serious  national problem," he said. "Rather, many members believe this is a regional  problem, to be addressed at the local level.  </P> <P> "I ask that, whatever actions you decide to take, you try to coordinate them  with the rest of the North County cities. Congress is more inclined to focus  attention on North County's plight if the cities present a unified front,  showing that the damage to the area is widespread."  </P> <P> Money or no money, several residents who addressed the council said they are  primed for action.  </P> <P> "It's time for the council to bite the bullet. Enough time has passed," said  Diane Fradin, vice president of the board of directors of the Encinitas  community called Country View Collections.  </P> <P> More than 2 dozen people rose as Fradin waved her hand to the audience, asking  for a show of all those in favor of the declaration.  </P> <P> June Bello added: "While we've been sitting around discussing the issue  applying our little Band-Aids, this situation has worsened. The time for action  is now.  </P> <P> In recent years, a rising tide of Third World immigrants has crossed the U.S.  border, many settling at least temporarily in the North County, where their  makeshift encampments sit in contrast to newly built mini-malls and affluent  housing developments.  </P> <P> Although nearby cities in Orange County such as Costa Mesa, Laguna Beach and  Dana Point have also struggled with a migrant presence, none have experienced  the widespread encampments or the litter and sewage problems of Encinitas,  Carranza said.  </P> <P> The state of emergency might eventually bring state and federal funds for  housing and educational programs aimed at documented migrant workers, Carranza  said.  </P> <P> But a spokesman for the state's Office of Emergency Services said earlier  Tuesday he knows of no available money for the city's migrant problem.  </P> <P> "We normally deal with identifiable natural disasters, but this is something  entirely new," said Regional Manager Jim Alexander from his San Bernardino  County office.  </P> <P> "I've been looking for funding sources, but I can't find them. Maybe they can  go to some state and federal housing programs for the homeless. But personally,  I think it's a long shot."  </P> <P> Migrant advocates on Tuesday called the state of emergency declaration more  rhetoric from a city that's offered much talk and little action.  </P> <P> "This declaration is, to say the least, suspect," said Claudia Smith, an  attorney for California Rural Legal Assistance, a migrant rights group. "The  city hasn't met even a threshold obligation to help bring its migrant residents  out of their miserable living conditions. They just can't seem to get past the  hand-wringing stage."  </P></p>

It is this strategy that  will lead to the restoration of democracy in Haiti, Aristide  explained in a communique issued on 29 March.    Aristide was responding to the new U.S. initiative providing  for the simultaneous appointment of a new prime minister and the  resignation of the current military government in  Port-au-Prince, which would get amnesty. This plan also provides  for strengthening the international trade embargo by reinforcing  the watch over the border between Haiti and the Dominican  Republic in order to increase pressure on the military regime.    Father Aristide, who was informed of this new plan on 25  March by U.S. Vice President Al Gore, pointed out that he is  sticking to the eight-point plan that he presented to the United  Nations in October. The exiled president has added that if the  military gives up power on the morning [of any given day], he  will appoint a prime minister that very afternoon. [passage  omitted]</p>

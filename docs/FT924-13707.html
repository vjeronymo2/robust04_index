			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / People: Wyatt - customer-driven at Bull Carol Wyatt has been appointed director of product operations for Bull UK, the British subsidiary of the French computer manufacturer. Wyatt's appointment - it is a newly created position and she takes charge of a new organisation - reflects a growing conviction among computer manufacturers that they should be listening to what their customers want rather than offering them what technology can provide. She will oversee the strategic development and restructuring of the company's product marketing, ensuring that customer requirements are effectively relayed to product development staff. Wyatt will have charge of over 100 product consultants with sales, marketing and technical expertise. Wyatt, now 35, started as a secretary with Texas Instruments, and moved to sales of personal computers and printers before transferring to Bull  - and some sales management jobs - in 1983: 'It was a challenge,' she says dryly of her unorthodox career. She seems to relish challenges. Her successes include leading the Bull team which won the 1990 contract for the Inland Revenue's 'terminal of the nineties' system.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Auckland, June 1 (AFP) -- Kiribati's acting head of  state was forcibly moved from office by police Wednesday in what  he slammed as an "administrative coup".    "Because we do not have an army here in Kiribati I cannot  call it a military coup, but I can call it an administrative  coup," Tekire Tameura, the now deposed chairman of the interim  council of state, told AFP by telephone from the capital, Tarawa.    He said the acting police commissioner "dragged (me) from my  chair".    It is the latest turn in a growing drama in the Micronesian  state which earlier this week saw parliament dissolved and  administration handed over to a council of state.    It took over within hours of the fall of the government of  President Teatao Teannati on Monday.    In the 36-seat Maneaba-ni-Maungatabu, or assembly, the  ruling  National Progressive Party suffered a defeat, 21-19, when the  opposition moved to set up a select committee to investigate  misuse of public funds.    Tameura, who was also the head of the Public Service  Commission (PSC), chaired the council along with Speaker  Beretitara Neeti and Chief Justice Faqir Mohammed.    But then it was found Tamuera's public service position  expired on May 28 and that technically he could not continue  with the council.    He refused to stand down.    "Only the president can ask for my resignation," he said  Wednesday.    There being no president, he could not be asked to resign.    However former cabinet secretary Ata Teaotai was named by  the  other two as a replacement on both the PSC and the council.    Tameura refused to accept the ruling and on Wednesday went  to  the PSC office.    While he was there the police showed up.    "I am now no longer chairman," he said. "On the orders of  the chief justice I was dragged from my chair by the acting  commissioner of police."    He was taken to a car, driven to his council office, allowed  to collect personal items and then taken home.    Police had been placed at the council office to prevent his  entry.    "Of course I am offended, I am taking legal advice."    He believed the action in removing him had nothing to do  with  his contract status but was "very political.    "People here know what it all means, but Kiribati is a very  peaceful country and it is very quiet."    The country will go to the polls on July 21 (east of the  international dateline) and July 22 (west of the dateline).  July 29 has been set aside for second-round voting if results  are not decisive. A month later, successful candidates will  elect a president.    The next election is not due until mid-1995.    Details of the alleged corruption which bought down the  government have not been made public yet, but relate to misuse  in hotel accommodation, transport, entertainment and gifts.    Kiribati, the former British colony of the Gilbert Islands,  consists of 33 islands totalling 811 square kilometres (324 sq.  miles), whose 68,000 population, known as "I-Kiribati", are  predominantly Micronesian.    Its capital atoll, Tarawa, was virtually flattened by the  Americans when they landed marines their in 1943 to dislodge  Japanese forces who had taken over most of the Gilberts.    The largest coral atoll in the world, Kiritimati or  Christmas, was used for atmospheric nuclear testing by Britain  and the US in the 1950s and 1960s.    The Maneaba-ni-Maungatabu includes a seat for Banaba or  Ocean  Island despite the fact that British phosphate mining all but  destroyed it and the bulk of its people have been resettled in  Fiji.</p>

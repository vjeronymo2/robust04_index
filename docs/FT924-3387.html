			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / International Company News: Amax halves payout on 'abnormal' prices AMAX, the third-largest US aluminium producer, is halving its quarterly dividend to 10 cents a share because of 'abnormally low' prices for the metal. The company will also take charges totalling Dollars 399m after tax, partly offset by a Dollars 192m income tax benefit. Mr Allen Born, chairman, estimates Amax, which makes about two-thirds of its earnings from aluminium, will suffer a fourth-quarter loss of about Dollars 50m before special provisions. The company reported a net loss of Dollars 49m, or 57 cents a share, for the first nine months of 1992, compared with net earnings of Dollars 40m, or 46 cents, in the same period of last year. Amax will take a charge of Dollars 97m (Dollars 61m after tax) to adjust the carrying value of various non-core assets and provide for additional 'streamlining and downsizing' costs. Mr Born suggested these adjustments would benefit future annual pre-tax operating earnings by Dollars 25m. The company is accounting for the full impact of the Financial Accounting Standard Board pronouncements in 1992. The effect of the employee benefits costs obligation of Dollars 338m after tax would be partly offset by a Dollars 192m benefit resulting from the adoption of the new rules for income taxes. Southern Peru Copper Corporation, which owns two mines and a smelter in Peru, is paying a Dollars 7m dividend for the third quarter compared with Dollars 4m in each of the previous 1992 quarters. In 1991 it paid shareholders - Asarco (52.3 per cent) Marmon Group (20.7 per cent) Phelps Dodge (16.3 per cent) and Newmont Mining (10.7 per cent) - dividends totalling Dollars 60m. Last year, the Peruvian company produced 300,200 short tons of copper, 3.1m troy ounces of silver and 6.7m lb of molybdenum.</p>

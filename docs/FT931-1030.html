			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / The Coal White Paper: 'Greens' give grudging welcome ENVIRONMENTALISTS gave a grudging welcome yesterday to the white paper's acknowledgement that 'in the longer term environmental pressures will operate against coal as a primary source of energy'. The environmental damage caused by coal burning is well-recognised - the emission of carbon dioxide, thought to be implicated in global warming, with sulphur dioxide which contributes to acid rain, and nitrogen oxides which cause breathing difficulties. The white paper concedes that it is impossible to say whether its measures will lead to more coal being burnt in the UK. That depends on British Coal's success in winning more sales with the benefit of the new subsidies. But Mr Dieter Helm, director of Oxford Economic Research Associates, said: 'The effect of the subsidies is likely to be the displacement of overseas coal imports with British coal - the total coalburn in the UK may not go up.' Environmentalists welcomed the smaller role given to orimulsion because of its high sulphur content. The white paper expects an annual reduction in orimulsion use of at least 500,000 tonnes equivalent of coal. The Campaign for the Protection of Rural England also warmed to the shrinking share of opencast coal mining. The paper accepts British Coal's projections of a fall in opencast output from the current 16m tonnes to less than 12m tonnes in 1997-98. However, sharp differences emerged between the government and pressure groups over which fuels would replace coal in the long term. The white paper says: 'Some of the groups found themselves attempting to reconcile a wish for strict emissions targets, and hence a wish to phase out all fossil fuel burning, with a dislike for the nuclear option and support for coal in the short term. They were able to do so only by implausible assumptions about the speed at which renewables and energy efficiency could contribute.' Friends of the Earth and other groups attacked the statement that there was no reason to close down Magnox nuclear reactors prematurely. The white paper supported long-term research into clean-coal technology, which strips coal-burning power stations' emissions of many of their damaging components - although not carbon dioxide - but warned that the present cost made it uneconomic. Up to Pounds 12m of new research funds will go over next three years to British Coal's Research Establishment. Friends of the Earth called the paper's encouragement for renewable energy - wind and wave power - 'a glimmer of light'. The paper has accepted the recommendation of last year's advisory group that the UK should try to have 1,500MW of new electricity generating capacity from renewables by the year 2000.</p>

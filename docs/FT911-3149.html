			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / China gives welcome to mutual funds CHINA intends to accelerate plans to allow foreign investment in its fledgling stock markets by opening its exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen to mutual funds later this year, according to a senior Chinese securities official. Mr Wang Po-Ming, vice-president of China's Stock Exchange Executive Council which oversees the new securities markets, said in Hong Kong that a limited number of country funds would be allowed to invest in the 'later part of this year'. This is believed to be in addition to plans being finalised by Shanghai's stock exchange to allow direct foreign investment in two local companies, Shanghai Vacuum which produces television tubes, and Shanghai United Textile, a joint venture with a Hong Kong company. Officials at the exchange, which opened last December, hope to announce regulations for direct investment in these two companies within a couple of months. Hong Kong-based securities houses such as IndoSuez Asia, Barings and Jardine Fleming have been waiting for openings on China's stock markets, but had not expected until recently to be admitted this year. IndoSuez announced a Dollars 20m (Pounds 11.8m) Shanghai Fund late last year but has delayed its launch until the situation becomes clearer. Development of China's stock markets has been considerably slower than reform-minded officials have forecast in the past few years. Some officials are concerned about the possibly destabilising impact of foreign speculators on the small and unsophisticated exchanges, and there is also resistance from Peking hardliners. Mr Wang said that domestic interest in equities would be driven by China's high level of personal savings and declining bank interest rates. He predicted turnover on both the exchanges would more than double from last year's total of approaching Yuan 4bn (Pounds 434m). Private savings of approximately Yuan 700bn-1,000bn were a 'a tiger in a cage' which could 'come out at any time."</p>

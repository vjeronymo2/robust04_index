			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Judge aims to cure immunity system: The attorney-general is under siege about the advice he gave to ministers over public interest immunity certificates in the Matrix Churchill affair. John Mason reports that far-reaching reform of the government's powers to suppress official information now seems inevitable Whatever the future job prospects of Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, it is clear that the Scott inquiry will lead to a thorough overhaul of the government's use of public interest immunity (PII) to control publication of official information. The immediate aftermath of the Matrix Churchill trial led to accusations that ministers had sought to use PII - the application to a judge for approval not to disclose information - to protect the government by preventing publication of embarrassing material in spite of it clearly being of help to those in the dock. Sir Nicholas yesterday dismissed this interpretation of events as 'utterly untrue'. But the tense exchanges between himself and Lord Justice Scott provided an extraordinary demonstration that two of the most senior legal figures in the country could barely agree on anything about the application of this controversial procedure. This follows on from the admissions made to the inquiry by two figures involved in the Matrix Churchill PII claims. Mr Gerald Hosker, the Treasury solicitor, said that proper procedures had not been adhered to and backed calls for reform of PII to apply it only in limited circumstances. Mr Alan Moses QC, the barrister who brought the prosecution for Customs &amp; Excise, said the use of PII had damaged public confidence in the criminal justice system. PII procedure, he agreed, had to be changed. In yesterday's exchanges, the main dispute concerned whether ministers have any discretion to sign PII certificates. Sir Nicholas began by maintaining that such discretion did not exist, except in rare cases. It was for the trial judge alone to take the decision. It was this advice he had given Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, who was originally reluctant to sign his certificate. The exception, Sir Nicholas said in a statement at the start of the hearing, was based upon a ruling in a civil case in 1989. He said this allowed ministers the discretion not to apply for PII 'where there is a clear balance in favour of disclosure in the interests of justice'. But he added: 'This exception must not be invoked lightly. It would be wrong for the minister to rely upon it unless advised by counsel, who will inevitably have a far greater familiarity with the issues in the case, that there is indeed a clear balance in favour of disclosure.' Lord Justice Scott was insistent in probing whether ministers should ultimately decide if there was a serious risk of damage to the public interest before applying for PII. Before 1968, the courts had no power to challenge a minister's assertion that documents should not be disclosed. The House of Lords then made two crucial rulings - first, that such claims could be challenged in the courts, and second, that the government could use classes of privilege to apply for PII. These classes cover areas such as national security, the identity of informers and advice to ministers. The rulings allowed the challenging of ministers' judgments, but the ability to use class immunity has since been a means of applying for PII over an increasingly wide range of documents. Lord Justice Scott and Sir Nicholas clashed on a 1989 ruling by Lord Justice Bingham that ministers have a duty to assert PII that cannot be waived. But the ruling also allowed for voluntary disclosure where the public interest was plainly in favour of it. It is this which provides the exception that Sir Nicholas agreed could allow ministers to use their discretion. It was on this point, under pressure from an increasingly irate judge, that the attorney-general apparently shifted his position. A minister would take advice from prosecuting counsel over whether disclosure was plainly in the interests of justice, he said. However, he admitted, a minister remained able to ignore the barrister's advice and decide to disclose documents if he felt this appropriate. This admission appeared to contradict what he had said in his opening statement two hours previously. However, after the lunchtime news headlines said he had back-tracked on his main argument, Sir Nicholas issued a second statement. Matrix Churchill had not been one of these exceptional cases and his advice to Mr Heseltine remained correct, he said. If ministerial discretion dominated these exchanges, the class immunity system has caused equal alarm among lawyers. To legal observers, the most telling evidence given to the inquiry on this subject was provided by Mr Andrew Leithead, an assistant Treasury solicitor involved in the Matrix Churchill claims. The government was always 'generous' in the range of documents for which it sought to claim PII and only the most trivial of documents should not be subjected to claims, he said. The confidentiality of the Whitehall decision-making process had to be protected as a matter of principle, he said. It was this illustration of how Whitehall operates that alarmed many observers. One defence solicitor responded: 'It was the clearest demonstration that, when Whitehall thinking is allowed to go to extremes, it completely fails to allow for common sense - or any appreciation of the world outside the civil service. It is quite, quite, terrifying.' It seems certain that Lord Justice Scott will recommend that the government reforms PII. Within the criminal bar there is widespread agreement that these recommendations must be far-reaching and concentrate on reducing the amount of information withheld to the bare minimum. Mr Roy Amlot QC, a leading defence silk and former Treasury counsel, said: 'He (Lord Justice Scott) will certainly go to town on procedure and tighten ministerial responsibility. The first essential is that it should no longer be possible to use classes of documents to claim PII. He must insist it is only claimed on a document-by-document basis and only when there is a genuine public interest against disclosure.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Colombian Foreign Trade Minister Juan Manuel </F> Santos and Economic Development Minister Mauricio Cardenas by  unidentified reporters at the Cartagena Convention Center in  Cartagena; from the "National Newscast" -- live]    [Text] [Reporter] Minister Juan Manuel Santos, from your  perspective as foreign trade minister, what have been the most  important aspects of the Fourth Ibero-American Summit?    [Santos] First of all, the signing of the G-3 [Group of  Three  -- Colombia, Venezuela, and Mexico] Agreement. As President  Gaviria said, it is the most important trade agreement in  Colombian history. This was a specific achievement. Another  important point is that the main subject of the summit was  integration and commerce. For us, it has been very satisfying to  see that what we have been doing for the past two or three years  is precisely what all the other Ibero-American countries want to  do: promote integration and free trade, create more jobs,  increase production. The conclusion of this summit in the areas  of commerce and integration totally coincide with Colombian  policies. Therefore, it has been very satisfactory for us to  see that what we have done during the past three years is  supported at the Ibero-American and international levels.    [Reporter] We will now interview Development Minister  Mauricio Cardenas on today's working session. What are the  plans for investment and development for these countries?    [Cardenas] We had a very interesting meeting this morning,  during which Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and  Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez presented important  recommendations on ways to accelerate economic growth in Latin  America. We believe it is fundamental to follow up on the  proposed initiatives with special emphasis on social investment,  particularly on education. Those aspects are considered  necessary to accelerate economic development in our region and  to enable us to achieve an annual economic growth rate of 7 or 8  percent, which is the goal of all Latin American countries.</p>

			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Observer: Play the game Does England have Australia media tycoon Kerry Packer to thank for its surprise win against South Africa in yesterday's semi-final of the cricket world cup? Few people understand the new rules for rain-affected matches and even fewer can identify who thought them up. The controversial item is covered in the 'Play and Conditions for the World Cup' which is approved by the International Cricket Conference. Even so there is a suspicion that cricket's grey administrators, who agreed the new rule, may have been over-influenced by the need to keep their TV paymasters happy. The Sunday Times' reported last week that the idea behind the present rule came from Australia's voice of cricket Richie Benaud via PBL Marketing, a consultancy which has been closely identified with Kerry Packer's channel 9 TV network. Benaud is not on the organising committee but given his stature in the game his opinions are bound to get a hearing. There is no dispute about the sense of designing a rule to get a result at all costs. What is odd is the arbitrariness of the rules. The match was already being floodlit so it could easily have been continued after the showers. However, this might have caused havoc with the local TV schedules, especially if Australia had been playing.</p>

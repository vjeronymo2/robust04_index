			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Scottish recovery remote, study finds SCOTLAND is escaping the worst effects of the recession, but there is unlikely to be any real sign of recovery in the Scottish economy in the first half of this year and very little growth in the year as a whole. The Fraser of Allander Institute of Strathclyde University, Scotland's main economic study organisation, which made the forecast in its latest quarterly bulletin, points out that in January the rate of unemployment north of the border was indistinguishable from the UK average. That has not happened for more than a generation. Whereas unemployment in the UK rose by 62 per cent between March 1990 and last January, and that in the south-east of England by 128 per cent, unemployment in Scotland rose by only 13 per cent. The institute points out that Scotland has been affected much less than southern Britain by high interest rates, partly because Scots have a lower level of home ownership and borrowed less in mortgages. Between 1980 and 1989 the ratio of mortgage advances to incomes rose by 19 per cent in Scotland, compared with a rise of 41 per cent in southern England. The forecast says the advantages that have protected Scotland from the worst of recession will unwind as recovery gets under way.

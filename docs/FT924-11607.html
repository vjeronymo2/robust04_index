			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Met commissioner named MR Paul Condon was named yesterday as the new Metropolitan Police commissioner and pledged to 'improve the quality of life in the capital so far as policing impacts on it'. Now chief constable of Kent, Mr Condon will be, at 45, one of the youngest commissioners ever when he succeeds Sir Peter Imbert in January. He said that, in addition to improving the quality of life in London, his other priorities would be to improve the security of people living and working in the capital and to encourage respect for the rule of law. 'So that means heavy emphasis on the ethical standards of policing in London.' The post of Metropolitan commissioner has the highest profile in British policing. Ministers will be hoping that Mr Condon will improve the national image of a service that has been damaged by repeated scandals over miscarriages of justice. Mr Condon, who joined the police in 1967, was selected for accelerated promotion three years later and attended St Peter's College, Oxford, from 1972 to 1975, gaining bachelor's and master's degrees in jurisprudence. He served in the Metropolitan force before joining Kent as assistant chief constable, formulating plans for policing the Channel tunnel. He went back to the Met, returning to Kent as chief constable in 1989. He has been credited with improving managerial efficiency in the Kent force, and showing the emphasis on ethical standards that he plans to make a priority in London. Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, said Sir Peter had focused attention on the need to provide a high standard of service and maintain trust between the police and community. He believed Mr Condon would prove 'a forceful successor to a very distinguished commissioner'.</p>

			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / UN troops may take airport by end of week: Boutros Ghali will recommend deployment of 1,000 Canadians if fragile ceasefire holds CANADIAN troops could take control of Sarajevo airport by the end of the week if the fragile ceasefire, which came into force yesterday morning, continues to hold. But a United Nations official who forged the ceasefire agreement between the Bosnian presidency and Serb irregulars yesterday said: 'Anything could go wrong. 'We are relying on the good will of all sides to enforce the ceasefire. This is a real cliffhanger,' he added. Yesterday, French airport security officials who are working with the UN in Sarajevo, again visited the airport. They said it was not badly damaged by Serb irregulars who have blockaded the airport for the past 10 weeks, and have prevented food and medical supplies reaching Sarajevo. UN officials want to use the ceasefire to start de-militarising the airport, and its surrounding areas. If the ceasefire holds, UN secretary general Boutros Boutros Ghali will early this week recommend that the security council deploy 1,000 Canadian troops equipped with 80 armoured personnel carriers, to take over the airport. Yesterday, the city's inhabitants emerged from their cellars into the pouring rain, but few have high hopes in any lasting ceasefire. 'I do not believe in it. The Serb irregulars are already sniping,' said Mr Kemal Kurpasic, editor of Oslobedjne, the Bosnia daily newspaper. 'If they keep sniping, the Territorial Defence might be forced to respond,' he added. As he spoke by telephone from his apartment, a bullet ripped through his kitchen wall. 'You see what I mean. This is a very fragile ceasefire,' said Mr Kurpasic. Mr Zlatan Cabaravdiz, a journalist at Sarajevo radio, said both sides were weighting up the advantages in maintaining the ceasefire. 'We have seen ceasefires come and go,' he said. 'With this one, the Serb irregulars can re-group, and withdraw to the hills surrounding the city. They can shell and divide the city at any time. What would you expect the Territorial Defence to do then? Do you expect them to withdraw from the positions they already hold in Sarajevo?' he asked. Mr Kurpasic and western diplomats said the Serb irregulars, and Serbia's proxy army in Bosnia were using the ceasefire and international attention on Sarajevo as 'a smokescreen.' 'There are awful things happening in other towns and cities which are being besieged and where the killing never stops,' Mr Kurpasic said. Yesterday, western diplomats said Croat forces from Croatia were consolidating their own positions in Derventa, north of Bosnia, and in Mostar, east of the republic, despite repeated requests by the UN to Croatian president Franjo Tudjman to withdraw his forces from Bosnia. In Belgrade, the Serbian capital, about 10,000 students staged a peaceful demonstration against Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic, who has not been seen, or heard, for several days. Yesterday, Mr Dobrica Cosic, an ultra Serb nationalist, was elected the president of the new Yugoslavia, in a move likely to give the nationalists far greater say, and power, over the coming weeks.</p>

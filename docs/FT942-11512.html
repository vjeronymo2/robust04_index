			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Healthcall unaffected by government moves Healthcall, the doctors' deputising service whose flotation price will be announced today, said it would not be hit by government moves to reduce the out-of-hours burden on family doctors. Mr Maurice Henchey, chief executive, said the proposed changes would not affect present customers or put off potential new ones. His comments followed reports that the Department of Health and the British Medical Association were close to agreeing changes which would reduce the pressure on GPs to make out-of-hours calls which they considered unnecessary. GPs are not obliged to make calls requested by patients, but in practice find it difficult to refuse. It is thought the changes will make it clear that in certain circumstances the doctor can suggest the patient visits the surgery when open or go to a round-the-clock medical centre. But Mr Henchey said such changes would not reduce the attraction of deputising services for GPs. 'It does nothing to remove the mental pressure of being on call.' Any move towards open-all-hours centres should benefit the company. 'We have led the way, having operated five such centres on a pilot scheme basis for 18 months.' There is no suggestion that the strict obligation on deputising services to respond to house call requests would be relaxed. Of the 20,000 GPs who practice in urban areas, more than 15,000 have consent to use a duty doctor service. More than 8,300 subscribe to Healthcall. The company is expected to be valued at about Pounds 70m.</p>

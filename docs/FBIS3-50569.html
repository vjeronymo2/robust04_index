			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] It was learned last night at the Defense Ministry  that both Defense Minister Oscar Camilion and President Carlos  Menem signed the request for promoting two Navy officers without  having been informed about some controversial aspects of their  backgrounds. This situation was denounced by human rights  organizations.    According to a report published by the newspaper PAGINA/12,  both Navy officers, Captains Antonio Pernias and Juan Carlos  Rolon, have allegedly been charged with human rights violations  during the military government.    Defense Ministry sources have told LA NACION that there is  no  doubt that "someone will have to pay" for this situation, thus  implying that there were problems with the screening mechanisms,  which should have duly informed Defense Minister Camilion about  the delicate issue in question.    Defense Ministry sources have said that these promotions  would not prosper. The same was said in the Senate, which will  today review several promotions, but not those of Pernias and  Rolon.    When consulted, Navy sources admitted that the Navy is  experiencing a difficult situation because these two officers  were handed their respective insignias last week.    It has been learned that the names of those up for  promotions  were submitted to the Senate with some delay because the Navy  chief of staff was visiting Germany.    In addition, it was learned that the Navy did not consider  informing the executive branch about some controversial details  about the officers' backgrounds.    Obviously unaware of the situation, Menem yesterday denied  that his administration had proposed "promotions of such  magnitude."    Navy sources admitted that the promotions of Pernias and  Rolon were proposed "in compliance with the Constitution" and  that their records were previously reviewed by the Superior  Promotions Board.</p>

			<p><P> December 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> BOURQUE, JANNEY LEAD BRUIN WIN  </P> <P> The Hartford Whalers waited until the last period of their back-to-back series  with the Boston Bruins to make a move and by then it was much too late.  </P> <P> Defenseman Ray Bourque and center Craig Janney had four assists Thursday night  at Boston as the Bruins completed a sweep of the series, 8-2.  </P> <P> There had been bad blood between the teams since two games in late November in  which there was fighting and dangerous stick-swinging.  </P> <P> The Bruins won Wednesday night at Hartford, Conn., 5-1, in a contest devoid of  any untoward incidents. There were two calm periods Thursday, in which Boston  built a 6-1 lead.  </P> <P> Tempers flared in the last period. There were several brawls, high-sticking and  fights.  </P> <P> The sweep strengthened the Bruin lead in the Adams Division to five points over  Montreal and 10 points over the Whalers.  </P> <P> Detroit 5, Quebec 2 -- Nordique goalie Ron Tugnutt saved 42 shots and kept  Quebec in striking distance until Brent Fedyk and Bobby Dollas scored in the  final period to help the Red Wings to their second consecutive victory.  </P> <P> The Nordiques had won two consecutive games.  </P> <P> While the Red Wings peppered Tugnutt, Quebec fired only 17 shots at Detroit  goalie Tim Cheveldae, including only four in the third period.  </P> <P> St. Louis 4, Minnesota 2 -- The Blues spotted the North Stars an early two-goal  lead at St. Louis, before Brett Hull went to work.  </P> <P> The NHL's leading goal scorer tallied his 30th, then set up two of the three  Blues' goals in the third period that stretched their unbeaten streak to four  (3-0-1).  </P> <P> Bob Bassen scored two of the goals for St. Louis, which became the fourth team  to reach 40 points this season.  </P> <P> Chicago 5, Winnipeg 4 -- The Blackhawks spotted the Jets three goals in the  first period at Chicago but battled back to victory. Troy Murray and linemate  Dirk Graham scored two minutes apart in the last period to get the victory, the  20th for rookie Ed Balfour. He is the first to win that many this season.  </P> <P> The Blackhawks (22-10-2) lead the Norris Division by six points. Their 46  points are the most of any team in the league.  </P> <P> Pittsburgh 9, New Jersey 5 -- There have never been any doubts about their  ability to score. It's just that the Penguins have to score so many to win.  </P> <P> They weren't sure of ending their four-game winless streak at Pittsburgh until  Paul Coffey and Kevin Stevens scored early in the third period.  </P> <P> Although he gave up five goals in 37 shots, goalie Wendell Young won for the  first time in five appearances.  </P> <P> New York Islanders 2, Philadelphia 2 -- Randy Wood scored with eight minutes  left in regulation at Philadelphia to get the Islanders a tie.

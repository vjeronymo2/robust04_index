			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ARCHITECTS INSTITUTE HIT BY U.S. ANTITRUST SUIT  </P> <P> The American Institute of Architects violated antitrust laws by illegally  restraining trade, the Justice Department said today in a civil antitrust suit.  </P> <P> The group "unreasonably restrained price competition in the sale of  architectural services," the Justice Department said.  </P> <P> The industry trade group that represents many architects in America signed a  settlement agreement with the Justice Department that was filed simultaneously  in U.S. District Court.  </P> <P> A federal judge will have to review the government's suit and the consent  decree, and decide whether to accept the proposed settlement.  </P> <P> The Justice Department said that about 54,000 architects belong to the trade  group and that the AIA "entered into an unlawful agreement" to prohibit members  from providing free services, engaging in competitive bidding and discounting  their fees.  </P> <P> As part of the proposed settlement with the government, the architectural trade  group must "institute a comprehensive antitrust compliance program" during the  next decade, the Justice Department said.  </P> <P> Further antitrust violations "may result in disciplinary measures and charges  of criminal contempt," the Justice Department said.  </P> <P> It is not the first time the American Institute of Architects has been cited  for violation of America's antitrust laws. In 1972, a "final judgment" was  entered against the group for antitrust violations, the Justice Department  said.  </P> <P> The proposed consent decree "supersedes" the 1972 order, the Justice Department  said.  </P></p>

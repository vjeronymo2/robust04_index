			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Greek Embassy Secretary (Toulupas) was summoned on  26 March to the Foreign Ministry and was handed a note of  protest regarding an event on 21 March 1994 in which a group of  Albanians who had crossed the Albanian-Greek border were  mistreated by the Greek border forces.    According to exact data, after pointing an automatic rifle  at  the chest of 21-year-old Albanian citizen Alfred Abaz Muco, a  resident of Bubullime in Lushnje, a Greek soldier opened fire  with no reason at all, causing his death.    The note stresses among other things that the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Albania protests this ugly  and tragic act, pointing out that such actions impair  Albanian-Greek relations, create an unjustified situation of  tension, and run counter to international norms and statements  by the Greek authorities.    The note asks the Greek Government to give the necessary  explanations about the circumstances of the event and take  measures to condemn the culprits and prevent the repetition of  such actions,which have occurred even in the past.</p>

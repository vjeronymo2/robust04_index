			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Tohoku Electric Power Company and Mitsubishi Kasei  Corporation's Research Center have developed a new ion exchange  resin with improved heat resistance up to 100C. Ion  exchange resins used in nuclear power plant core water  purification systems in the past have had a low maximum  temperature for use of 60C, so it has been necessary to  cool the 280C core water down to about 50C to purify  it, which results in a large loss of heat. Researchers succeeded  in synthesizing a strongly basic ion exchange resin with superb  heat resistance by inserting alkyl spacer groups with three or  more carbons between a styrene-divinyl benzene resin matrix and  quaternary ammonium groups to separate them from each other. The  effectiveness of this resin was confirmed in practical  evaluative tests, and the researchers plan to proceed with  development toward the establishment of an industrial  manufacturing process in the future.    First researchers synthesized an ion exchange resin that has  alkyl chains with different numbers of carbons by performing  suspension polymerization of a styrene derivative containing  alkyl spacer groups with divinyl benzene. Then they compared the  survival rate of quaternary ammonium groups after exposure to  100C temperatures for one month. In previous resins, the  survival rate for quaternary ammonium groups (with single carbon  atoms) lies in the 60% range, but when the number of  carbons is  increased to three or more, the survival rate jumps to  80% or  higher, which is a clear improvement in heat resistance.  Researchers also confirmed that the thermal decomposition  mechanism is different from that of previous resins.    The researchers also performed practical evaluative tests on  the resin with four carbon atoms (C[.sup]4[/] resin). When  they packed a column heated to 95C with 400 mL [sic] of  resin and studied the loss in exchange quantity capability at a  flow rate corresponding to 100 L/hour, the current strongly  basic ion exchange resin (Mitsubishi Kasei brand Daiyaion  [phonetic] SA10A) retained only 80% of its exchange capability  after 15 days and dropped to 70% after one month.  However, the  C[.sup]4[/] resin retained 89% of its exchange capability  after one month. When they tested the resin's silica adsorption  performance at 95C, there was a slight amount of leakage  with the initial water flow, but after steady state was  achieved, the silica concentration values fell below the minimum  required for analytical determination.    Nuclear power plants need more compact equipment, and if  this  resin enables core water to be purified at a higher temperature,  it will lead to simpler heat exchangers. Researchers at both  companies plan to perform evaluative tests in the future and  work toward establishing an industrial manufacturing method.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The seventh session of the legislature ends on 9  May, and it looks as if this session's final meeting will be  stormy. National Assembly President Firmin Jean-Louis has  convened the legislators for 9 May at the Haitian legislature to  conclude the seventh legislative session but Bernard Sansaricq,  who claims he is president of the National Assembly, has also  convened the legislators. Here is a report on this situation by  Leontes Dorzilme.    [Begin recording] [Dorzilme] The parliamentarians of the  45th  legislature must meet in national assembly on 9 May in order to  close the seventh legislative session. The president and  vice-president of the National Assembly, respectively Senator  Firmin Jean-Louis and Deputy Robert Monde, officially convened  this meeting on 6 May. Today, 9 May, eyes remain glued on the  Legislative Palace where there is much disagreement.    Will the elected representatives of the National Front for  Change and Democracy agree to sit down with the parliamentarians  elected on 18 January 1993, who are themselves very determined  to attend the meeting convened by the office presided over by  Sansaricq? Who will the real president of today's session be?  No one knows. We have received two convocations in our  newsroom, issued by the two -- antagonistic -- offices of the  Senate of the Republic. There is a slight nuance, however:  Chamber of Deputies President Monde and Jean-Louis, president of  the official Senate Office, are expecting the members of the  45th legislature at 1100, while Sansaricq is expecting them at  1200.    One cannot anticipate which side Monde -- who is torn  between  two forces and who, according to what he himself has said, will  cooperate with whichever Senate Office is operative -- will  support.

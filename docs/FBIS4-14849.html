			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia's first payment to Kazakhstan for the  Baykonur cosmodrome will be $1.25 Bn (the size of Kazakhstan's  debt to Russia -- INTERFAX). This fact was disclosed at a  Monday news conference in Alma-Ata [Almaty] by the Kazakh Deputy  Prime Minister for Science Galym Abilsiitov.    He said Russia will also pay a monthly rent of $115 Mn  partly  in cash and partly through mutual settlements.    Abilsiitov said the head of administration in Leninsk where  the cosmodrome staff lives will be appointed jointly by the  presidents of the two countries and the chief of the cosmodrome  by the Russian head of state with the consent of his Kazakh  counterpart. A special envoy of the Kazakh president is  supposed to be present at the cosmodrome.    Abilsiitov said that Kazakhstan and Russia should work out  the contract on the cosmodrome in three months. The Kazakh  government shall act as lessor and the Russian as lessee.  Abilsiitov will head the Kazakh side of the commission. In his  opinion the work has only begun and will be quite difficult.    The deputy prime minister also said that the national  aerospace agency will be moved to Leninsk from Alma-Ata.    Commenting on Abilsiitov's statement one of the drafters of  the agreement on Baykonur told INTERFAX that the size of  compensation for the use of the facility has not been approved,  while under the agreement it should not exceed the size of  Kazakhstan's debt to Russia. He said he could not understand  what compensation can be in question, "as Russia has actually  covered all the spending on the maintenance of the cosmodrome  alone." In his opinion, "if Russia had stopped spending on  Baykonur two years ago, there would have been nothing to rent  today."</p>

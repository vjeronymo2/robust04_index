			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Fidele Djessa] </F>   [Excerpts] The recent vast movement of nominations that  took place at the Paracommando Rapid Intervention Force [GATL]  was not to the liking of some soldiers who expressed their  displeasure in a leaflet that was not at all in favor of their  new commandant. The government, which has turned a deaf ear to  all unpleasant comments, has not hidden its intention to  continue to "reorganize" the Army which it suspects is  "unfaithful" on several accounts.    On 6 May at 1000, General Abdoulaye Coulibaly, former GATL  commanding officer at the Abidjan Port-Bouet Air Base, handed  over to Lieutenant Colonel Ettien Koffi, who was promoted to the  rank of GATL commandant by President Henri Konan Bedie on 29  April. [passage omitted]    "This promotion smells badly of tribalism," an officer who  sought anonymity said. "Why didn't President Bedie chose  Colonel Adama Dosso who, according to the hierarchy, is second  to Gen. Coulibaly?" To substantiate his assertion, the officer  gave the following explanation: "In case you do not know, in  regard to hierarchy, after Gen. Coulibaly, there are Colonels  Vassanoussi Bamba, Adama Dosso, Ettien Koya, and Leopold Guidi.  Following them are Lieutenant Colonels Fofana Bourgoin and  Boubacar Kouyate. All these officers come before Lt. Col.  Ettien Koffi.    It is not surprising for one to evoke tribalism when things  are not done the right way. Frankly, although I agree that it  was time for Gen. Coulibaly to leave after such a long time as  GATL commandant -- although I think his dismissal was done in a  gross manner -- I cannot accept the fact that the Army is being  politicized with nominations that are not in line with military  order and discipline. In my opinion, the Army should put itself  above all political maneuvers for the security of the country."  [passage omitted]    These allegations are false, counterattacked "strategists"  from the Presidential Palace who agreed to talk to us  unofficially on the real reasons for the appointment by the head  of state. They said, right after the appointment of the  general, we were confronted with a regional problem that was  threatening the security of the state. We absolutely agree with  those who expressed their discontent, saying that Gen. Coulibaly  is followed by Col. Vassanoussi Bamba and Col. Adama Dosso.  However, what people pretend to ignore is that to giving the  command of the GATL to one of these two would mean concentrating  the command of two major units -- and we are talking about the  Armed Forces here -- in the hands of two officers from the same  region, namely Touba. Colonels Vassanoussi Bamba and Adama  Dosso, like the commanding officer of the national Navy, are  both from Touba. This fact could not be overlooked in a context  such as ours." [passage omitted]    All these real or supposed conflicts make the Armed Forces  of  Cote d'Ivoire a powder keg that could explode at any moment  because of the deteriorating social structure.    [Abidjan LA VOIE in French adds the following in its 9 June  edition: "The news which was being kept secret has finally  leaked out. Col. Faizan Bi Sehi has been dismissed from the  command of the Paracommando Rapid Intervention Force. On  reasons behind the dismissal, various versions have been  advanced including a story on high interest loan repayments  deducted at source from soldiers' pay by someone close to Col.  Faizan Bi Sehi. In fact, this measure is nothing compared with  rumors of forthcoming measures on the punitive transfer of  officers, which are masterminded by the strategists and other  advisors of President Bedie the self-proclaimed president of the  Republic of Cote d'Ivoire.]</p>

			<p><P> November 7, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ADVISERS HIRED FOR POSSIBLE GRADCO BUYOUT  </P> <P> Gradco Systems Inc. said Monday that it has hired financial and legal advisers  in connection with a possible management-led buyout of the Irvine-based office  equipment manufacturer.  </P> <P> The Irvine firm announced in late September that its chairman, Keith B.  Stewart, was pursuing a possible buyout of the publicly held company. In a  statement Monday, Gradco reconfirmed that Stewart was still "actively pursuing"  a possible buyout.  </P> <P> Gradco, the world's largest supplier of collating and sorting equipment for  office copiers, said it has retained the Lodestar Group, a Los Angeles  consulting firm specializing in leveraged buyouts, as a financial adviser. The  company also said it has hired the Newport Beach law firm of Bruck &amp; Perry  as its legal counsel.  </P> <P> Separately, Gradco disclosed that it has been named in a class-action lawsuit  filed Oct. 26 in Superior Court in Santa Ana. The suit, filed by Gradco  shareholder Moise Katz, alleges that Gradco officers and directors may have  breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the Stewart buyout offer,  Gradco said.  </P> <P> Gradco officials declined to comment on the suit. Katz could not be reached for  comment.  </P> <P> A copy of the suit could not be obtained late Monday.  </P> <P> In a statement, Gradco said "management believes the action to be without  merit, and based upon faulty premises. The company intends to vigorously defend  the suit."  </P> <P> Gradco also said it has appointed a special committee of the firm's two outside  directors to review any buyout proposal. The committee has retained separate  financial and legal advisers.  </P> <P> Analysts have speculated that the buyout plan might involve a Japanese bank or  investment consortium because Gradco does about one-third of its business in  Japan and is a supplier to all of Japan's leading office copier makers.  </P> <P> Gradco made its announcement about the buyout after the stock market closed  Monday. The company's shares fell $1.375 per share to $16.75 in heavy trading  on the over-the-counter market Monday.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, May 2 KYODO -- Japan and the United  States reconfirmed Monday [2 May] that they will continue to  seek a negotiated solution to the controversy over North Korea's  alleged nuclear weapons program "if at all possible," Japanese  officials said.    In working-level defense talks at the Pentagon, Japan  pledged  to "fulfill its responsibilities within the constraints of the  constitution" should the United Nations take measures such as  economic sanctions to enforce its demand for full inspections of  North Korean nuclear facilities.    Concerning the North Korean nuclear issue, Prime Minister  Tsutomu Hata's minority government plans to stick to the  policies of the coalition under former Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa, Japanese defense officials told their U.S.  counterparts.    Pentagon officials expressed concern over the standoff  between Pyongyang and the International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA), which has been demanding unhampered access to nuclear  sites, including a radiochemistry laboratory, believed to be  part of a covert weapon program.    They also pointed to the "extremely important" role of  China,  North Korea's traditional ally, in efforts to find a peaceful  solution to the controversy.    Washington again raised its request for Japanese  participation in its Theater Missile Defense (TMD) scheme, a  scaled-down version of former U.S. President Ronald Reagan's  Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), but the Japanese delegation  remained noncommittal.    They did, however, promise to "study" the proposal,  including  its "cost-effectiveness."    The U.S. officials also urged the quick conclusion of an  agreement that would facilitate swapping material such as fuel  and services between the U.S. forces stationed in Japan and the  Japanese Self-Defense Forces (SDF).    Such an agreement would also benefit the SDF in future  United  Nations-led peacekeeping operations, the U.S. officials said,  according to the Japanese officials.</p>

Regarding the internal situation in Angola, Robaina said  that  Cuba and Angola maintain excellent relations, which are  experiencing a period of mutual understanding. With regard to  relations with Chile, the foreign minister said they will be  reestablished at the moment the Chileans consider most opportune.    On Cuba's relations with the United States, Robaina stated  that while the United States' language may be less aggressive;  the blockade has intensified.    [Havana Radio Progreso in Spanish at 1200 GMT on 7 January,  in a similar report, adds: "Robaina announced: `We are obliged  to go through Switzerland, so we have to take advantage of  that'. There too, meetings at the Foreign Ministry are planned...    "The Cuban foreign minister mentioned the existence of new  prospects for the political and economic ties between our  country and Europe. As to the conflict in the state of Chiapas,  he said he hoped the Mexicans would be able to find the best  solution. Lastly, Robaina said that Cuba's situation is very  difficult, but that we are not in a dead-end alley. Although  1994 will not be greatly different from 1993, the spiral will  begin moving upwards."]</p>

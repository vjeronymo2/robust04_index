			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / International Company News: BSN growth rate slows 5% in year BSN, France's largest food group, yesterday announced an underlying 5 per cent increase in net profits last year, a sharp slowdown on its 1991 earnings growth rate. Net profits were just over FFr3.6bn (Dollars 676m), which represents a decline on total net profits of FFr3.9bn in the previous year, but an increase after stripping out the one-off capital gain made by the sale of BSN's champagne businesses in 1991. Published turnover rose by 7.2 per cent from FFr66.1bn to FFr70.8bn, but underlying group sales rose by only 2.8 per cent, after adjusting for exchange rate changes and the impact of acquisitions, including France Plats Cuisines, the prepared food business, Pycasa, the Spanish frozen food business, W&amp;R Jacob, the Irish biscuit producer and Italaquae, the Italian mineral water supplier. BSN's operating profits rose by 7 per cent last year, as did cash-flow, which reached FFr7.4bn, or FFr3.7bn after industrial investments. Its dairy products branch continued to be the main source of sales, up from FFr23.8bn to FFr26.1bn over the same period, an adjusted rise of 4.8 per cent, the strongest growth of any of BSN's divisions.</p>

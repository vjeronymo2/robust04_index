			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / (CORRECTED) UK Company News: Chelverton poised to take stake in LBC Correction (published 23rd November 1992) appended to this article. Chelverton, a property and venture capital company chaired by Sir Leslie Porter, the president of Tesco, is in detailed negotiations to invest some Pounds 2m in LBC, the London commercial radio station. In return for the money, as an element of the capital restructuring of the Crown Communications subsidiary, Chelverton would get a substantial slice of the equity. Its directors include Mr John Porter, son of Sir Leslie and Dame Shirley Porter, The aim would be to stabilise LBC's financial position to allow it to apply next year for a renewal of its franchise. Under the restructuring debt would be replaced by equity and Crown's banks - Bank of Scotland and ANZ - would become sizeable shareholders. Loss-making Crown would cease to exist as a separate entity after the disposal of its non-LBC assets and Crown would then be a minority shareholder in LBC. As part of the deal Mr David Haynes, the present chief executive, would stay on as chief executive of the reformed LBC. It is envisaged that Lady Porter, a former non-executive director of Capital Radio, would become a director. The Porter money would not be available in one tranche but would be tied to performance targets. The restructuring is clearly a risk based on the premise that LBC can retain its franchise. CORRECTION Sir Leslie Porter has retired from Tesco. In yesterday's story on LBC we referred to him as president of Tesco.</p>

			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / French unemployment falls Further evidence of France's economic recovery emerged yesterday with the news that the level of unemployment fell slightly in July for the second month in succession. The number of people out of work in July fell by 10,800, or 0.3 per cent from June, with the overall jobless total reaching 12.6 per cent, or 3.22m people, against 12.7 per cent for May. Rising unemployment has for the past four years been one of the toughest problems facing France. The socialist government's failure to address the issue was a key factor behind its defeat in last year's parliamentary election and the recent reduction in the jobless figures has helped boost the popularity of Mr Edouard Balladur's centre-right administration this summer. Economists anticipate further reductions in the unemployment figures during the autumn and winter, albeit at a gradual pace, given that the rate of growth is expected to slow.</p>

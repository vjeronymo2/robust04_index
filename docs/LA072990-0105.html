			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN JOSE;  </P> <P> NURSING HOME IS CLOSED BY OFFICIALS  </P> <P> The San Jose health department has closed a nursing home after a five-month  surveillance revealed serious deficiencies in the treatment of 62 elderly  patients, officials said.  </P> <P> Carla Framiglio, district administrator for the health department, said she  recommended closing the 160-bed Evergreen Healthcare after receiving calls from  vendors who said they would no longer provide services to the home. Framiglio  said changes in patients' conditions were not reported to doctors, errors  occurred in giving patients medicine and records lacked proper documentation.  She said her staff had issued 21 citations -- seven for serious deficiencies --  during Evergreen Healthcare's first year of operation. Officials have placed 40  Evergreen residents and were still trying to locate the relatives of the  others.  </P></p>

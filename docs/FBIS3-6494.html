			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] ROK vernacular newspapers publish on 18  March articles and editorials reacting to the assessment made by  the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on the inspections  of the North Korean nuclear facilities.    The conservative CHOSON ILBO publishes on page 3 a  1,200-word  article by reporter Pak Tu-sik on the ROK Government's moves.  The article reports government authorities were "quite at a  loss" with the IAEA report and "the trend is leaning toward the  inevitability of referring the issue to the UN Security Council."    The article notes that the government showed an attitude  quite different from previous ones quoting Nuclear Ambassador  Kim Samhun as saying: "Our patience has come to a limit. We  doubt if North Korea is a dialogue partner." The article  analyzes that such a shift to a hard-line position was based on  the judgment that only "dialogue with sanctions" could solve the  problem.    CHOSON ILBO publishes on page 3 a 1,200-word article on U.S.  reaction by correspondent Chong Hae-yong from Washington.  Describing that "the United States is enraged and embarrassed to  be cheated again," the article reports that although voices  demanding stronger measures are increasing, the U.S. Government  will not completely close down the communication channel with  North Korea but seek a resolution through dialogue while  pressing it with UN sanctions.    The moderate TONG-A ILBO publishes on page 2 a 500-word  article on the background and prospects of the IAEA Board of  Governors' special meeting by correspondent Kim Uk-hui from  Bonn. While expecting a strong IAEA resolution against North  Korea, the article speculates that the IAEA will not immediately  announce that the continuity of safeguards has been broken and  impose sanctions. The article expects that "the resolution will  focus on demanding additional inspections."    TONG-A ILBO publishes on page 3 a 1,200-word article by  reporter Kim Cha-su analyzing ROK Government's view on the  nuclear issue. The article says the government is preparing to  resume the Team Spirit exercise and expedite the deployment of  Patriot missiles. The article also reports that a government  official explained that "dialogue is meaningless under the  situation in which the international community is heading for  ultra-hard measures."    The article also speculates that North Korea might not come  to the 19 March North-South working-level contact for the  special envoy exchange due to the ROK Government's drastic  change of attitude.    TONG-A ILBO publishes on page 3 a 1,200-word article on  Washington's view on the IAEA inspection results by  correspondent Nam Chan-sun from Washington. The article reports  there are various analyses as to why North Korea had not open  the radiochemical laboratory. One of them is that North Korea  intended to use the last inspection during the special envoy  exchange negotiation or the third-round of talks with the United  States to do so. Another is that North Korea really has  something to hide. The article says "if the latter is the case,  the nuclear negotiation will completely fall into a deadlock  which can only be resolved by a dramatic change of North Korea's  attitude."    The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN publishes on page 3 an  800-word editorial entitled "Is There Any Way To Secure North  Korea's Cooperation?" The editorial says it is time that the  ROK Government develop more effective measures to deal with the  North Korean nuclear issue. Stressing that "the most imperative  goal of North Korea at the moment is to maintain its  establishment," the editorial says the ROK Government should  first decide whether it wants to support or interfere with North  Korea's efforts to maintain its establishment in order to  develop a strong initiative for the negotiation.    SEOUL SINMUN publishes on page 5 an 1,200-word article by  correspondent Yi Kyong-hyong from Washington on the U.S. view.  Along with an ultimatum for the complete acceptance of nuclear  inspections, the article expects that "the United States will  exercise various types of pressures including the deployment of  Patriot missiles and the mobilization of the aircraft carrier  currently conducting sea exercises in the north Pacific." The  article states that "the U.S. pressure will still be based on  its policy to resolve the nuclear issue through dialogue."    The article also expects that UN sanctions will not  immediately begin with ultra-hard ones but be taken in a phased  manner.    SEOUL SINMUN publishes on page 5 a 1,000-word article by  reporter Yi Sung-chol on ROK Government's view. The article  contends that the government believes that the direction for the  resolution of the nuclear issue should be changed now but would  still like to wait to see how serious the IAEA was when it said  the inspections were "insufficient" and continue with dialogue  effort.    SEOUL SINMUN also publishes on page 5 an 800-word article by  reporter Yu Se-chin on the IAEA view. Noting that the  inspection result, which is usually announced two weeks later,  was announced only one day after the inspection team returned,  the article reports that "this implies the suspicion over  military use of nuclear material is very serious." The article  also speculates that the IAEA "was prepared" for the negative  result.    The article says the only choice left for the IAEA is to  refer the issue to the UN Security Council after giving North  Korea one last chance to unconditionally accept thorough  inspections.    The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN publishes on page 3 an  800-word editorial entitled "Wake Up From Fantasy of North  Korea." The editorial says "the broken seals no doubt mean that  North Korea used nuclear material for other purposes" and urges  both ROK and U.S. Governments to stop mollifying North Korea  because "Pyongyang will never come back to shake hands."    KYONGHYANG SINMUN publishes on page 5 a 1,000-word article  by  reporter Yi Sung-chol reporting that "the moderate Foreign  Ministry wants the resumption of Team Spirit exercise to be  announced after a final conclusion is reached that the North  Korean nuclear issue can no longer be resolved through dialogue  while the hard-line National Defense Ministry wants the decision  made based on the result of IAEA special 21 March Board of  Governors meeting."    KYONGHYANG SINMUN publishes on page 5 a 1,000-word article  by  correspondent Yi Chong-yon from Washington reporting that  hard-line voice is again rising in the United States. The  article reports that "diplomatic sources in Washington expect a  dramatic change of attitude from North Korea around Kim  Il-song's birthday, which falls on 15 April."    KYONGHYANG SINMUN publishes on page 5 a 700-word article on  the prospects of the 21 March IAEA Board of Governors special  meeting by correspondent Son Tong-u from Bonn. Noting that the  two undeclared facilities had not been included in the check  list of the recent inspection, the article says that it is clear  that the IAEA is conducting the inspection in accordance with  "political negotiations" and therefore "the IAEA is not expected  to take a decisive countermeasure during the 21 March meeting."</p>

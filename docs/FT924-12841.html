			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / The Week Ahead RESULTS DUE SMITHS Industries is expected to report on Wednesday a 15 per cent drop in pre-tax profit for the year to July 31 from Pounds 120.3m to about Pounds 102m, because of slowing demand in its key aerospace sector with falling production rates of F-16 military aircraft and Boeing 737 airliners. Cash generation is thought to have remained strong and interest income healthy at about Pounds 14m despite spending on acquisitions, particularly in its medical sector. An increased dividend of 11.2p (10.7p) is likely. Earnings are expected to fall to 23p from 27.6p. Albert Fisher, the fresh produce distributor and food processor, upset its shareholders in July with a profits warning. The shares dropped 25p on the day to 41p and have fallen fur ther since it said a glut of produce would hit profits. Analysts cut their forecast to about Pounds 60m from Pounds 77m for the year ended August, against Pounds 89m a year earlier. The company has many fences to mend when it reports on Thursday. Wolseley, the heating and building supplier, announces final results for the year to July 31 tomorrow and is expected to reveal pre-tax profits of close to Pounds 70m, down from Pounds 80.3m a year earlier. With the UK market flat, analysts will be hoping for signs of upturn from Wolseley's United States operations. Results from Brossette, the French supplier acquired earlier this year, will be included in the second half but any contribution is expected to be small. Paterson Zochonis, the Cussons soap and toiletries maker and overseas trader, is likely to report tomorrow full-year pre-tax profits fractionally ahead from last year's Pounds 25.4m. It will be a creditable performance considering that one-third of its sales are in Nigeria, which has suffered a 40 per cent devaluation.

			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Cookery: Hearty fare to bring home the harvest THE LANES are alive with the sound of machinery as combine harvesters chomp their way through the fields, devouring the grain rapaciously all day and half the night. Clank, march and munch in a blaze of headlights. Although the manner of harvesting has changed greatly down the years, harvest foods remain much the same. Lunch in the fields, now as then, usually includes bread, cheese and some sort of pickle or relish. There are meat pies for the fortunate and fruit cake for all, washed down with home-made lemonade or ginger beer. At the end of the day, as likely as not, there will be a good, honest stew with plenty of meat and rich gravy. It is comforting and sustaining for the workers and a sensible choice for the cook because it is easy to prepare, can be left to bubble gently unattended, and will keep without spoiling if timetables overrun. Rabbit is the classic choice of meat, not least because this is the season when they are best to eat and the farmer is keen to take his revenge. After idle months devoted to growing fat and sleek on his corn, the safe world of the crop is felled and rabbits are forced to flee the scene of their crimes. It seems only just that they should run into the sights of waiting guns before being popped into the pot. HARVEST STEW (serves 4-6) This is an old favourite given an aromatic new twist with lemon and fennel. Marinating makes sense, irrespective of the age of the rabbits. Not-so-youthful creatures will need tenderising and juveniles will benefit from added flavourings. Ingredients: 2 rabbits grown plump on harvest corn, cut into neat portions (save the heads, rib cages, belly flaps and other trimmings for stock); 3 fennel bulbs weighing 6-8oz each, trimmed and cut into 6-8 wedges each (save the feathery fronds for garnish and add the other trimmings to the stockpot); 2 lemons (one separated into juice and zest, the flesh of the other chopped into tiny pieces); 1pt stock made from the rabbit and fennel trimmings; 5 tablespoons olive oil; generous  1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds, bruised; 2 garlic cloves, chopped very finely; a tablespoon or so of flour; 1 x 50 gram tin anchovy fillets, drained and cut into snippets; about 3 tablespoons chopped parsley, preferably flat-leafed. Method: Make the stock and marinate the rabbit in three tablespoons each lemon juice and olive oil mixed with the bruised fennel seeds, finely-chopped garlic and plenty of coarsely-ground black pepper. Leave in a cold larder for 24 hours, turning the meat occasionally. To cook, drain the rabbit joints well, reserving the marinade. Dust with flour and colour in batches in the remaining two tablespoons olive oil in a shallow, heavy-based stewpan or flameproof casserole. Remove and reserve the meat. Then, saute the fennel briefly until streaked with gold. Set the fennel aside. Pour on the stock, which should be hot, and stir to scrape up the flavoursome sediment from the pan base. When the liquid is bubbling well, return the rabbit to the pot, add the marinade and the finely-chopped lemon. Bring to a bare simmer. Cover tightly and cook over the lowest possible flame for at least 1 1/2 hours. If the harvesters' supper has to be delayed for whatever reason, the stew can be left to cook for up to 2 1/2 hours without spoiling - although a fire-retardant mat could be advisable to protect against sticking and burning. Fifteen minutes before the end, check seasoning and add the prepared wedges of fennel to the stew. Push them down between the pieces of meat, immersing them in the gravy to heat them through speedily. Finally, chop and mix the feathery fennel fronds with the parsley, the finely-grated zest of one lemon and the snipped anchovies. Scatter the mixture over the surface of the stew for added savour just before bringing the dish to table. Plain boiled potatoes or noodles go well with this. Alternatively, omit the anchovies from the garnish and partner the stew with a crusty loaf of home-baked bread and a pot of anchovy butter. ANCHOVY BUTTER Serve this, as described, with harvest stew or spread it on toast to eat alone or to slip under poached eggs or grilled tomatoes. Small pats of anchovy butter are also excellent for topping grilled steaks, for enriching fish soups, and for anointing grilled fennel. Ingredients: 4oz butter, at room temperature; 1 x 50 gram tin of anchovy fillets. Method: Dice the butter and put it into a soup plate. Add the anchovies, cut into snippets, and mash them into the butter with a fork, gradually working in half the oil from the anchovy tin. Pack the butter into a pot, smooth the top, cover, and chill until shortly before serving.</p>

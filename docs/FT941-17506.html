			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Arts: Jazz tunes in to anniversaries Important anniversaries are celebrated in 1994 by two jazz record labels which each represent distinct and different aspects of the music. Expect much retrospection, recorded and live, to mark the occasions. Norman Granz's Verve label was founded in 1944 with the launch of the Jazz At The Philharmonic shows in Los Angeles. JATP stars who found a home on the Granz labels which later became Verve included Charlie Parker, Lester Young, Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holliday. On April 6, survivors Illinois Jacquet and Flip Phillips will be joined by current stars Joe Henderson and Betty Carter in a concert at New York's Carnegie Hall for the start of the year-long celebration. The reclusive Granz may even put in an appearance on the first night. ECM, the German label which encapsulates all that is new and spiritual in jazz, is 25 this year and founder Manfred Eicher is thought to be organising appropriately ascetic and European events. Fans of Jarrett, Garbarek, Surman et al would do well to watch the listings in the autumn for signs of European Contemporary Music activity in a city near them.</p>

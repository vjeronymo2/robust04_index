			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Budget '92: Luck may smile on Lamont - Britain's chancellor has more room for manoeuvre to produce an election-winning Budget Mr Norman Lamont has had less than his share of political good fortune since becoming chancellor. But half way through pre-Budget purdah, his luck may be changing. Although the immediate outlook for the UK economy is bleak, and his second Budget on March 10 will have to take account of a sharp downwards revision of the government's growth forecast for this year, the chancellor has more room for manoeuvre than only a month ago. Providing there are no disasters, he should be better placed than at the start of the year to influence the economy and the outcome of the forthcoming general election when he finally reveals the secrets of Mr Gladstone's battered red and gold Budget box to the nation. At first sight, Mr Lamont has little reason to be pleased with his lot. The economic recovery that was promised so many times last year has proved elusive. Official figures, due on February 20, are expected to show that gross domestic product resumed its decline in the fourth quarter of last year. The economy is now thought to have shrunk by a steep 2.5 per cent in 1991 compared with the government's Autumn Statement forecast of a 2 per cent drop in GDP. The persistent recession is prompting the Treasury and outside forecasters to scale back expectations of growth this year. The latest survey of UK forecasts by Consensus Economics, a business information group, released yesterday points to growth of 1.2 per cent this year compared with the 2.3 per cent GDP gain forecast by the Treasury last November. Gloom has been compounded by several downbeat soundings of business opinion over the past month, culminating in the Confederation of British Industry's quarterly industrial trends survey which saw business optimism fall compared with the previous quarterly poll in October. Paradoxically, pressures on financial markets have eased. Moreover, the idea of a more active fiscal policy to combat the recession is gaining respectability, giving the chancellor more elbow room. Fears of a sterling devaluation in the European Monetary System have receded. Although the pound has been stuck at the bottom of the exchange rate mechanism, it weathered December's sharp increase in German interest rates without significant support from the Bank of England. Interest rates have edged downwards. The three-month interbank rate - at about 10.5 per cent yesterday - is now pointing to a Budget-time fall in base rates from 10.5 per cent at present, while several top mortgage providers were able to cut their lending rates by about 0.5 percentage points last month. The market for government gilt-edged stock has been strong while even equities have gained moderately in the teeth of adverse company news. By last night, the FT-SE 100 index was up by about 1 per cent compared with the start of the year. The thaw on financial markets has coincided with a growing acceptance in the City that the government will be forced to increase its borrowing this year beyond existing targets. The City consensus indicates that the chancellor should be able to 'give away' about Pounds 2bn in his Budget. But some economists, including Mr Roger Bootle of Midland Montagu and Mr David Kern of National Westminster Bank, think he can cut taxes by Pounds 4bn. A Pounds 4bn give-away is not very great in the context of a Pounds 600bn economy. But it has to be set against rising public expenditure and a deteriorating trend in the nation's public finances. The 1991-92 public sector borrowing requirement is almost certain to exceed the government's most recent forecast of Pounds 10.5bn. Even before taking Budget changes into account, lower than expected growth suggests that the government will be hard pressed to keep the 1992-93 PSBR down to the 3 per cent of GDP, or roughly Pounds 18bn, assumed in November's Autumn Statement. But rising PSBR figures have been losing their power to shock. Advocates of greater fiscal activism argue that lower taxes or higher government spending are a necessary response to the constraints imposed by sterling's membership of the exchange rate mechanism. They are encouraged by Britain's low level of government debt compared with other leading industrialised countries and recent events abroad. This week's high 6.4 per cent wage settlement in the German steel industry has underlined the inability of Britain and other EC countries to cut interest rates so long as the Bundesbank is determined to keep German rates high in the cause of low inflation. So what can Mr Lamont do? The evidence so far suggests that he will opt for an economically prudent Budget but with a politically persuasive cut in personal taxation. The City and financial markets are aware that Mr Lamont is under strong political pressure to produce a vote-winner. His scope for action may be growing: some analysts have suggested that the markets can tolerate a more expansionary policy if this leads to a Conservative election victory. So long as opinion polls do not count the Tories out, parts of the media and the City are prepared to interpret bad economic news as good news for Mr Lamont. Thus, the worse the state of the economy, the more he can cut taxes. Mr Lamont seems therefore to have the luxury of choice. He can opt for a populist 'give-away' Budget or pursue the cautious and prudent course that has hallmarked the 14 months of his chancellorship. He is not an unpolitical chancellor. He was Mr John Major's campaign manager in his successful bid for the premiership. He helped stoke the election campaign that has been under way since New Year with charges that Labour was the party of higher taxes. By bringing the taxation of incomes into the forefront of the party battle, he has inevitably raised expectations about tax cuts to the point that no move to ease the income tax burden would be a big surprise. An FT survey this week showed that a very large majority of Tory MPs wants the chancellor to cut taxes to boost the economy ahead of the election, a message that was reinforced at a meeting between Mr Lamont and backbenchers this week. Although most MPs said they would prefer increasing the thresholds before people pay tax, the odds on a cut in the basic rate of tax are shortening. There are strong political arguments in favour of lowering the basic rate to 24 pence in the pound from 25 pence. It makes for better headlines and would force Labour to declare in an election campaign whether it would raise taxes again. But income tax cuts are expensive. One penny off the basic rate of tax would cost Pounds 1.95bn. Raising allowances by more than inflation is a potentially cheaper option. But each percentage point increase in the allowances still costs Pounds 210m. Although the chancellor could, for example, increase allowances by double the 4.5 per cent statutory rate determined by December's inflation rate at a cost of about Pounds 950m, he might still have to claw back money elsewhere, perhaps by trimming the benefits that would accrue to higher-income earners through any tax cut. Earlier this week, the bandwagon behind a tax-cutting Budget was gaining such strength that it was causing some alarm in the Treasury. It is also a moot point whether such expectations are entirely welcome to Mr Lamont. As a former City banker and a Treasury minister since 1986, he knows that markets are fickle and can withdraw support without warning. Before he disappeared into purdah last month, he repeated his long-standing objection to fiscal activism by telling a meeting of the National Economic Development Council that abandoning the idea of a balanced budget over the economic cycle would risk a build-up of problems when economic growth returned. After a recent meeting with finance ministers from the Group of Seven top industrial countries, he appeared to rule out radical moves to stimulate the economy. 'The recovery,' he said, 'had been delayed, not cancelled.' The Bank of England is also advising caution. In a speech to the Overseas Bankers Club in London this week, Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the Bank's governor, argued that the conditions for recovery were in place and that only 'selective, well-designed measures' should be considered for boosting activity. Mr Leigh-Pemberton's comments suggest that a good deal of thought is being given to those parts of the Budget which can offer help for industry and businesses. The Treasury has come under intense lobbying from the CBI, the Institute of Directors and other trade groups to make this year's Budget one for business. Among ideas put forward have been increased incentives for investment, a lowering of the burden of inheritance tax on family businesses and action to reduce the impact of rising uniform business rates, particularly in the hard pressed south-east of England. Such lobbying can bear fruit. In last year's Budget, Mr Lamont announced cuts in corporation tax rates and other tax breaks for business following representations from industry. This year, however, he may pause before announcing such far-reaching steps because - last year's sharp rise in company failures and receiverships notwithstanding  - the UK company sector's overall financial position has improved over the past 12 months. This underlying improvement has encouraged suggestions that the chancellor should introduce time-limited investment incentives, just to give the economy an extra push. These could be along the lines of the pre-Christmas package of measures to help the housing market, in which the government suspended stamp duty on most house purchases until August. But so far Mr Lamont has underlined that the housing package was a specific measure to deal with a particular problem and has rejected further fiscal fine tuning. Some observers said he should bank on a recovery of business and consumer confidence that should follow an early general election, now looking likely on April 9. In recent months there has been growing concern among businessmen that uncertainty about the election date and outcome is acting as a brake on activity. Some companies may be holding back from investment in the hope that an incoming Labour government would provide more generous incentives. A more widespread grumble is that fear among higher earners of an effective 59 per cent upper rate of income tax in the event of a Labour victory is restraining demand and the purchase of big ticket items such as cars. These fears, if true, imply that a government election victory would be followed by an upsurge in investment and demand. Such a scenario could persuade Mr Lamont against too open-handed a Budget that would jeopardise his medium-term goal of returning to budget balance over the course of the economic cycle. Being prudent might be a really bold move for a chancellor who, between now and the Budget, will be under heavy pressure from Tory backbenchers anxious about their re-election prospects. The feral nature of politicians in fear of defeat should not be underestimated. However, it must not be forgotten that Mr Lamont has proved himself to be a determined fighter against inflation and also has ambitions to be a tax-reforming chancellor. Although the pressures on him are strong to deliver a 'feel good' Budget, he will not want to risk his credibility with financial markets or exhaust room for future fiscal manoeuvre in the event of his being re-appointed chancellor.</p>

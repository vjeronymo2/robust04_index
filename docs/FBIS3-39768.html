			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Government is determined to apply the measures  against Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia--FYROM], and the imposition of new measures is not  ruled out if [FYROM President] Mr. Gligorov continues to ignore  the conditions set by the Greek side.    Official opposition leader Miltiadhis Evert today reiterated  support for the Government on national issues. Our correspondent  Fotis Kafarakis has the following report:    [Begin recording] [Kafarakis] Despite the pressure being  exercised by various sides, the Government's decision to place  an economic blockade on Skopje remains firm. Moreover, it is  not ruled out that new measures will be imposed if the leaders  of the neighboring statelet continue to reject the three Greek  conditions for resumption of the dialogue under UN auspices.    New Democracy Chairman Miltiadhis Evert made a statement in  Preveza reiterating that Greece does not accept threats. Hands  off hellenism and respect for Greece was the message that Mr.  Evert sent in all directions.    Interior Minister Akis Tsokhatzopoulos, speaking in  Iraklion,  talked about the PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement]  government following a different national strategy on the Skopje  issue than past governments.    [Tsokhatzopoulos] It struggles to change things, it  struggles  to succeed where others accepted conciliation and betrayal in  the past.    [Kafarakis] The Greek measures against Skopje will be  discussed at the European Union's council on general affairs in  Brussels on Monday. Our 11 partners will examine if these  measures are compatible with Greece's obligations to the  European Union. This question was raised yesterday during the  visit to Athens of both German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel and  Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes.    For his part, Political Spring Chairman Andonios Samaras,  who  is visiting northern Greece, said that our partners should not  demand we revoke the measures but should revoke their  recognition of Skopje.    Finally, it is noted that the measures against Skopje are  being applied in an absolutely satisfactory manner, as Deputy  Finance Minister Alexandros Papadhopoulos has said. [end  recording]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed NEGA report] </F>   [Text] "The draft budget for 1994 presented to the Supreme  Soviet in which expenditures coincide with revenues defies  common sense and has no economic legitimacy." This is said in a  statement by the Ukrainian Constitutional Democratic Party  [UCDP] promulgated on 24 January. In the opinion of the  Constitutional Democrats, the attempts to please international  financial organizations will only further discredit Ukraine as a  country "run by ignoramuses." The UCDP believes that no one in  Ukraine has any illusions about the cabinet of ministers, but  the performance by Finance Minister Hryhoriy Pyatachenko has  transcended all permissible bounds. The UCDP has called for his  immediate resignation. Meanwhile the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet  will not return to the consideration of the budget until 27  January.</p>

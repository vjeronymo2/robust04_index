			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Survey of Switzerland (6): Wiring up the car industry - Max Koch founded his company, Komax, on a bright idea When he was a young electrical engineering student in Zurich, Max Koch had the idea of making speed control units for cars. It was 1975, the time of oil crisis and motorway speed limits. Demand for his product took off. Koch, now 44, set up a company to make the units. Because they needed lots of wires, he designed and built a special wire processing machine. Today, his company - Komax, a word play on his name - is the world's largest supplier of such machines, selling to the world's biggest car manufacturers and suppliers. Komax initially supplied machines to cut and strip flat cables for the home electronics industry. Customers included big Japanese names such as Hitachi and Sanyo. In 1981 it moved into the motor business, which now accounts for more than half of sales. As well as machines for cutting, slitting, crimping and notching cables, Komax also makes wire processing centres to produce whole cable harnesses for vehicles. Some 70 per cent of Komax's production is in Switzerland - the company is based in Dierikon near Lucerne - with 20 per cent in the US. The rest is in low-cost Portugal, where a new plant supplies the local operations of companies including General Motors and Siemens. With the rapid growth of electronics in cars, Koch sees new opportunities. The increasing popularity of anti-skid brake systems (ABS) and airbags, for example, means more sensors to control these and thus more wires. At present, Komax has around 50 per cent of the market for wire processing machines in Europe and nearly a third worldwide. In the US, business grew by almost 40 per cent last year, although recession has slowed performance in Japan and Germany. Like other Swiss companies with profitable niches in world markets, Komax spends heavily on research and development: between 10 and 12 per cent of its SFr75m turnover. With recession in Europe, where business declined by 10 per cent last year, Komax decided to modernise its product line in readiness for the next upturn. Its new range of wire processing equipment is fully automatic, with colour graphics, built-in quality control systems and simplified controls. Koch is more optimistic about prospects for 1994, after a 5 per cent decline in sales last year. He expects resumed growth of around 10 per cent in Europe. 'Companies can stop buying for one or two years, but not for long'. Nearly 15 per cent of Komax's business is in Asia, with more to come. More machines will be developed for specific markets. 'In the past, we tended to sell European machines to the US and Asia.' Koch himself felt confident enough about the company's strength to bow out of the day-to-day running of the company in order to concentrate on strategy and innovation. He is now chairman, with a new chief executive brought in from outside. 'When I was 35, I decided to be out of the operating side when I was 40. I did it at 39.'</p>

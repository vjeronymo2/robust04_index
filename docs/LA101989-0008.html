			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> D.C. HEARINGS SOUGHT ON BORDER VIOLENCE  </P> <P> Three U.S. representatives from Southern California have called for  congressional hearings in San Diego to explore ways of reducing what many see  as an escalating pattern of violence along the U.S.-Mexican border.  </P> <P> Writing that the situation is "explosive," the three lawmakers -- Esteban  Torres (D-Pico Rivera), Jim Bates (D-San Diego) and Mel Levine (D-Los Angeles)  -- recited a series of recent violent confrontations near the border.  </P> <P> Among the incidents mentioned: the shooting in August of a 15-year-old Mexican  boy by a member of the U.S. Border Patrol and the death shortly before of a  14-year-old who was run over and killed by a Border Patrol vehicle.  </P> <P> "We do not feel we can sit back any longer and wait for yet another tragedy,"  the three representatives wrote in a letter, dated Oct. 12, to Rep. Gus Yatron,  D-Pa., chairman of the Foreign Affairs subcommittee on human rights and  international relations. "While we recognize that Border Patrol officers are  often subject to harassment by unsavory elements . . . methods must be found to  reduce the potential for violence at this international crossing."  </P> <P> A subcommittee spokesman in Washington called the request for a hearing  "legitimate" and indicated that a session could probably be arranged before the  end of the year. However, because of budgetary restrictions, the foreign  affairs panel is limited to holding hearings in Washington. That has prompted  Torres, who spearheaded the move, to seek out a Judiciary Committee  subcommittee that deals with immigration issues and would be able to travel.  </P> <P> Among the possible actions aimed at reducing border violence, the lawmakers  wrote, is an in-depth study of stress among U.S. border guards to determine  whether there is a need for more manpower, improved training or even a  restructuring of the agency.  </P> <P> The Border Patrol, a uniformed enforcement arm of the U.S. Immigration and  Naturalization Service, has more than 700 officers based in the San Diego area,  the largest such contingent in the nation. The region accounts for more than a  third of all immigration arrests throughout the Southern frontier.  </P> <P> Immigrant advocates and the INS said they would welcome the congressional  hearings.  </P> <P> "We are pleased that the problem along the border is finally being given the  attention it merits," said Virginia Kice , a spokeswoman with the INS' regional  office in Los Angeles, who noted that many Border Patrol officers have also  been attacked.  </P> <P> Roberto Martinez, who co-chairs a San Diego human rights coalition, is among  those who has pushed for the hearings. "The important point is that the  violence is getting worse, not better," said Martinez, border representative  for the American Friends Service Committee, a Quaker group.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, border violence is likely to be a key topic among U.S. and Mexican  officials who plan to confer in San Diego later this year on a range of border  issues.  </P> <P> Andrew Oltyan, a Mexico desk officer at the State Department in Washington,  said the session will involve a binational advisory group that examines issues  of joint concern to the two nations. Previous meetings have taken place in  Mexico City and Washington, he said, but officials have now decided to hold  more of the talks in border cities where the issues are experienced directly.  </P> <P> Apart from violence, some of the concerns to be addressed include arrest and  detentions of Mexican citizens in the United States and of U.S. nationals in  Mexico, the repatriation of minors from both nations, the use of material  witnesses from the two countries in legal cases and the return of recovered  vehicles that had been stolen and taken across the border.  </P> <P> "We're trying to focus in on where we're having problems and determine where we  can improve things," Oltyan said.  </P></p>

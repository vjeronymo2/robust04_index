			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Economic indicator's rise ends The recent rise in the Central Statistical Office's longer leading index has ended, new data showed yesterday. The index is designed to detect turning points in the economy about a year in advance. The index, whose components include the yield curve, building starts, the financial balances of industrial and commercial companies and business optimism, is now flat. This is mainly due to a large downward revision to December's housebuilding figures. However, the shorter leading index - intended to highlight changes in activity about five months ahead using share prices, car registrations and the Gallup index of consumer confidence - continued its 15-month rise. The coincident indicator, which tracks the business cycle, has risen steadily from its trough in the second quarter of 1992. All its components - including GDP at factor cost, industrial production, retail sales and M0 money supply - have contributed this year.</p>

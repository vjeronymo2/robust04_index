			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Staffan Bruun report: "Zhirinovskiy's Lawyer: Demands for </F> Compensation Are Up to European Levels"]    [Text] "If Finland is to join the European Union [EU], we  will also have to adjust our levels of compensation to those of  Europe. Our demands for compensation from HUFVUDSTADSBLADET and  the Swedish Theater are high by Finnish standards, but not  compared with the practice in Europe. And if damages were to be  awarded in the United States another zero would be added to the  figures."    So said Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's legal representative,  assistant district judge George Paile. He gave assurances that  the cases against HUFVUDSTADSBLADET and the Swedish Theater will  be pursued as private actions regardless of whether the public  prosecutor supports the actions or not.    This means that Jutta Zilliacus' column of 14 April will be  the subjected to legal examination. Helsinki District Court  will have to decide whether or not the word "madcap"  [galenpanna] damaged Zhirinovskiy's good name. In the same way  the Swedish Theater's use of Zhirinovskiy's voice in the play  Mein Kampf will also be examined by the district  court.    Paile is demanding a total of 14 million markkas from  HUFVUDSTADSBLADET and the Swedish Theater in damages to  compensate for loss of earnings and mental suffering.    Paile confirmed to HUFVUDSTADSBLADET that his boss has  neither read the column in HUFVUDSTADSBLADET nor seen the play  at the Swedish Theater.    So in what way has he suffered harm?    "I have translated the column for Zhirinovskiy so he is well  aware of what it says. I have also reported how the Swedish  Theater used his voice and how the theater identified him with a  notorious war criminal. Zhirinovskiy has been informed that we  are bringing a case and has approved our action," Paile said.    According to Paile, there are also limits to how insulting  one can be about politicians.    "Politicians should accept more criticism and more  acrimonious criticism than ordinary people, but there are  limits. Politicians also have a right to defend their  integrity. People should not be allowed to insult them just  anyhow. If people do this in a newspaper or in a theater they  must be prepared to be taken to court and ready to pay damages."    George Paile said that he is considering further legal  actions in Finland.    ``There are a few borderline cases that I am still giving  consideration to. The principle is that I will only bring an  action if I am sure of winning. That is why it is possible that  there will not be any more actions, this time.    ``On the other hand there will be many similar actions  brought out in Europe. Some of them I am involved in  personally, but in countries where I cannot manage the language  I am hiring lawyers. As Zhirinovskiy's representative in the  West it is my job to protect his legal and economic interests.''    Is this good business?    "Of course it is good business."    It is still unclear when the case will come before the  district court. But what does seem to be clear is that this  will not be before late August/early September.    Legal experts think it extremely unlikely that Zhirinovskiy  and Paile will win their cases and be awarded damages.    Nevertheless Pekka Koskinen, professor of criminal law, is  critical of Jutta Zilliacus'column.    ``I have read through her text very carefully and have to  admit that the column as a whole can be seen as insulting. The  word `madcap' is by no means the worst thing, but it would seem  that this word alone is being used as the argument for damages.  I think that to an extent Jutta Zilliacus has fallen to the  same level of linguistic usage that she is criticizing  Zhirinovskiy for.    ``Nevertheless I could never imagine that HUFVUDSTADSBLADET  would be found guilty. In 1983 a number of Eduskunta deputies  from the Finnish Rural Party claimed damages from Rundradion  because a program had made ironic and acrimonious remarks about  them. The deputies won their case in the city court and the  Court of Appeal, but lost in the Supreme Court.    ``The reason for the acquittal was that politicians and  public figures must be able to stand criticism and irony. In  the light of this it is unthinkable that HUFVUDSTADSBLADET would  be found guilty.''    According to Koskinen, as far as the Swedish Theater is  concerned it is if possible even clearer that a guilty verdict  is out of the question.    "If the Swedish Theater only used a 10-second sound bite of  Zhirinovskiy the theater could not possibly be found guilty. It  is crystal clear that people can make free use of pictures of  politicians and quotations from them."    This has not always been the case in Finland, Koskinen  recalled.    "In the thirties a Finn was found guilty of speaking  disparagingly about Adolf Hitler."    Jutta Zilliacus cannot understand Pekka Koskinen's criticism  of her column.    ``It is shameless of Koskinen to say that my column is  insulting. The column is watertight and it does not primarily  criticize Zhirinovskiy, but more the mass media and Paile.    ``Koskinen seems still to be living in the old Stalinist  times when people were not allowed to criticize politicians at  all. It is as if he believes that the Soviet Union still exists  and that every attack on a Russian political leader leads to  reprisals,'' Jutta Zilliacus countered.</p>

But he  did not give any further explanation.    Xiao Yang, who attended the National People's Congress [NPC]  session as a nonvoting member yesterday, answered two questions  by reporters regarding the Xi Yang incident as he was about to  leave the session site.    [Reporter] What is the situation regarding Xi Yang?    [Xiao Yang] It has already been made known to the outside.    [Reporter] Will he be released?    [Xiao Yang] If his performance is good, he will be treated  leniently in keeping with our legal provisions.    Moreover, he also said the authorities would consider  whether  or not to release the pro-democracy activist Wang Juntao, who is  now ill in prison, ahead of time in keeping with the law and the  actual situation.    He said that Wang Juntao is now in "very good" condition and  that the authorities are treating his hepatitis B in line with  their humanitarian policy.    On the other hand, seizing the opportunity afforded by the  opening of the NPC and Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference [CPPCC] sessions in Beijing, representatives of the  Hong Kong Journalist Association [HKJA] went to the XINHUA Hong  Kong Branch to deliver an open letter to the NPC deputies and  CPPCC delegates from Hong Kong yesterday, urging them to help in  this matter and to inform the quarters concerned so that they  would handle the Xi Yang case in a fair, open, and just manner  and allow Xi Yang's family, employer, and lawyer to contact him.    In the letter, the HKJA specifically pointed out that it has  been over five months since Xi Yang was arrested and detained on  27 September and that it has been over two months since the  court began to handle his case. However, so far, there has been  no news about his trial or a verdict. According to the PRC Code  of Criminal Procedure, a court of law should pronounce judgment  one month after it begins to handle a public prosecution or must  do so not more than one and a half months at the latest. In  view of this, the period since Xi Yang was turned over to the  court has already exceeded that for ordinary public prosecutions.    Three representatives of the HKJA went to the XINHUA Hong  Kong Branch yesterday but only HKJA chairman, Li Yuet-wah, was  allowed in to deliver the letter. The two staff at the XINHUA  Hong Kong Branch who received the letter, however, did not  clearly promise to hand the letter to the NPC deputies and CPPCC  delegates from Hong Kong. Li Yuet-wah quoted the XINHUA staff as  saying that the case "would be handled according to procedure."  Asked what procedure would be followed, the staff answered:  "Some time has to be spent in order to handle the matter."    HKJA Executive Committee member Fang Su said: For nearly  half a year since Xi Yang was detained, he has only been allowed  to see his father on one occasion when they talked about things  unrelated to his case. At the end of last year, a court  official said that Xi Yang did not want to hire a lawyer but the  HKJA doubts this. Moreover, Xi Yang has since been isolated and  has not been able to see his employer or lawyer.    Fang Su said: The HKJA sent letters to the CPPCC delegates  and NPC deputies from Hong Kong, the Preliminary Work Committee,  and Hong Kong affairs advisers, asking for help in the matter  and got some positive response, including the fact that some  CPPCC delegates have relayed the matter to the relevant quarters  on many occasions in the hope that the Xi Yang case can be  handled leniently.    He added that for more than five months since Xi Yang was  arrested and detained, people in the press circles have been  very much concerned about him.    The HKJA urged the persons concerned to help again in line  with their humanitarian spirit and the spirit of rule of law by  relaying to the quarters concerned its requests which include  respecting Xi Yang's proper legal rights; allowing him to see  his family and the delegates and deputies and to contact his  lawyer; conducting a trial in a fair, just, and open manner;  allowing his family and representatives of his employer to  attend at his trial; and allowing Hong Kong and overseas media  to listen to and report the trial proceedings.</p>

			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Divisions remain over dollar THE DOLLAR suffered a setback against the D-Mark yesterday after the Bundesbank president issued a cautious note on the prospects for a further easing in German credit policy, writes James Blitz. After Monday's dramatic 3-pfennig rise, the US currency fell back yesterday to close at DM1.5635, down about  1/2 pfennig on the day. However, the decline has not changed the perception of dealers that the dollar will rise sharply against the German currency in the longer term. In New York trading the dollar improved to finish at DM1.5670. Yesterday's decline was partly due to pre-election jitters. There were rumours that Mr Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, wants the dollar to drop back to Y100 against the yen to reduce the Japanese trade surplus. These were denied by Mr Clinton's advisers. A more serious setback was delivered by Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, who said further cuts in interest rates depended on success in reducing the budget deficit and the level of domestic wages for 1993. Mr Mark Brett, an economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in London, believes that the dollar rise cannot be capped much longer by tight Bundesbank policy. He thinks that the market's fixation with Germany's credit policy will fade as the country's economic situation deteriorates. 'Germany faces next to zero growth in the short term and stubborn inflation, while real yields on German bonds are moving below those in the US,' says Mr Brett. 'Are you sure you want to hold a currency that is underpinned by short-term interest rates and nothing else?' he asks. In his view, a high currency yield will prove no better a shield for the Bundesbank than it was for the Bank of England. Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at the European securities wing of International Bank of Japan, says the dollar rise will remain constrained. 'The dollar could reach DM1.65 or DM1.70,' he adds. 'But those are next year's rates.' In his view, uncertainty over the US economic upturn will restrain the dollar revival before then. This week's non-farm payroll figure will indicate whether the Federal Reserve will have to ease rates further. In the longer term, Mr Hannah believes that the budget deficit increase sanctioned by Mr Clinton, if he is elected, will become a problem for the dollar. He also believes that, although German rates will come down, the easing may not happen until the turn of the year. Money markets have already priced in all the easing that will happen before the end of 1993. 'Where is the surprise element that will boost the dollar further?' he asks.</p>

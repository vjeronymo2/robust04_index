			<p><P> March 28, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> NORTHRIDGE TAKES A PEEK AT FUTURE WHILE FALLING TO PEPPERDINE, 6-5  </P> <P> The development of a young ballplayer is not unlike the gradual maturity of  young child: Success often comes after a series of failures.  </P> <P> But every once in a while, there is a glimmer of what is to come -- the tiny  shuffle before that big first step.  </P> <P> Bill Kernen, Cal State Northridge's first-year baseball coach, caught a glimpse  of the future Monday and liked what he saw.  </P> <P> Sure, Northridge dropped a 6-5 decision to Pepperdine in a nonconference game  at CSUN, but that wasn't the point. The Matadors-in-training -- five of  Northridge's starting eight in the field were freshmen -- had given a good  enough account of themselves to inspire some serious post-game verb tossing.  </P> <P> "For us to go two games against a talented, experienced, quality, top-level  Division I team like Pepperdine and beat them by one, then lose by one, that's  a positive step for the program," said Kernen, whose team beat Pepperdine 5-4 a  month ago. "I've been a lot more disappointed after some of our wins than I am  right now."  </P> <P> Specifically, Kernen was smiling over what he referred to as a "significant  event" that took place in the fourth inning of Northridge's seventh loss in 10  games.  </P> <P> Four consecutive Matador batters -- three of them freshmen -- took turns  tatooing the wall surrounding Matador field. The barrier survived the attack,  but Pepperdine starter Wayne Helm didn't.  </P> <P> Helm, who came in averaging a strikeout an inning, led, 2-0, and had allowed  only two hits through 3 2/3 innings, but that impressive start quickly  unraveled.  </P> <P> Greg Shockey staggered Helm by blasting a triple that landed halfway up the  wall in straight-away center field, 400 feet from home plate. J. D. Haendiges,  also a first-year player, followed with a double that one-hopped the spot where  Shockey's ball landed.  </P> <P> Northridge (13-9-1) tied the game, 2-2, when Ted Weisfuss scored Haendiges with  a line-drive double down the left-field line.  </P> <P> Craig Clayton, another freshman, chased Helm and gave the Matadors a 3-2 lead  with a double off the wall in right-center.  </P> <P> "Right there," Kernen said, "they showed who they really are and who they're  going to be when they grow up."  </P> <P> Indeed, Pepperdine's Andy Lopez is one coach who isn't thrilled with the  prospect of facing these same not-so-cherubic faces in, say, another two years.  </P> <P> "They're going to be good," Lopez said. "They're not just playing five  freshmen. They're playing five really good freshmen."  </P> <P> Of Northridge's 11 hits, eight were by freshmen -- including solo home runs by  Denny Vigo and Clayton.  </P> <P> Vigo's homer, which easily cleared the 375-foot sign in left-center field, tied  the game, 4-4, after Pepperdine used two singles, an error and a sacrifice fly  to regain the lead in the fifth inning. It was Vigo's first collegiate home  run.  </P> <P> Clayton's third homer of the season, another drive to left, pulled the Matadors  within a run with one out in the ninth inning. And it almost ignited a winning  rally.  </P> <P> With two outs, Chae-Ho Chong walked and Anton Siegl doubled. Rusty McLain then  lifted a fly ball to shallow right field that Pepperdine outfielder Jalal Leach  caught off his shoe tops for the final out.  </P> <P> Britt Craven earned the save for Pepperdine, pitching the last 2 2/3 innings in  relief of winning pitcher Kipp Landis.  </P> <P> Landis (2-0) came on in place of Helm in the fourth.  </P> <P> Vale Lopez went the distance for Northridge, allowing 11 hits, walking four,  hitting a batter and striking out one. Lopez (3-4) served up home runs by Rick  Hirtensteiner, Chris Martin and Scott Shockey, Greg's older brother.  </P> <P> Scott Shockey's eighth-inning homer, which traveled approximately 450 feet to  right field, was the game-winning hit.

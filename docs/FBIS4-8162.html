			<p>BFN     [Text] Strobe Talbott emphasized at a news conference that  the atmosphere of the talks he had in Warsaw showed that  Polish-U.S. relations are excellent. The deputy secretary of  state assured Polish politicians about the continued support of  the United States for our reforms. He also told them that  Poland's security was of vital interest to the United States.    [Begin Talbott recording, in English with superimposed  Polish  translation] We believe there will be no more spheres of  influence in this part of Europe and that every country is going  to cooperate with others on an equal footing, irrespective of  their military strength. [end recording]    Strobe Talbott did not reply to a question on whether the  United States would meet some of the costs of Poland's  participation in Partnership for Peace. He merely noted that  certain costs were connected with the benefits that came from  participating in the program.</p>

			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Survey of Italian Industry and Technology (2): Restructuring and innovation - Lessons from the recession / Half-year results from Italy's industrial giants provided the first clear signals of a recovery The first six months of 1994 certainly marked a political turning point for Italy, but they were also significant for Italy's big industrial companies. After two to three years struggling against a global recession, a costly and inflexible labour market, an overvalued currency and, in certain cases, endemic corruption, Italian industry is returning to profit. The recent crop of half-year results from Italy's industrial giants provided the first clear signals of a recovery, as already hinted by official statistics and trumpeted by the new, ostensibly pro-business government of Mr Silvio Berlusconi. Montedison, the energy, chemical and agro-industrial company which perhaps more than any other enterprise has symbolised the recent trend in Italian industry, was the first of the large quoted companies to report half-year results. The group, brought to its knees last year by alleged mismanagement and corruption, returned to pre-tax profits for the first time since 1991. Its parent, Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin), also reported a return to the black. Another symbol, Fiat, the industrial and automotive group, revealed a profit before tax of L727bn for the first six months, compared with interim losses in the equivalent period of L982bn before tax; the first sign of the scale of the convulsion which the automotive market was suffering. Mr Gianni Agnelli forecast that the group's record losses of 1993 could be converted into a gross consolidated profit for 1994 of as much as Dollars 1bn. Pirelli, the cables and tyres group, also returned to the black in the first half, and although Olivetti, the computer manufacturer, disappointed investors with extraordinary losses on its investment portfolio, it cut its first-half operating loss to only L6.2bn and said it was still on course to break even at operating level for the full year, after three years in the red. The large industrial companies have finally begun to benefit from the momentous changes in their operating environment instituted over the past two years. In particular, the September 1992 devaluation of the lira and the loosening of a rigid labour market have begun to have an impact on group results. Protected by a weak currency, Fiat, for example, managed to increase its exports and push up its share of the depressed Italian market by 1.3 percentage points to 46 per cent in the first half. Marzotto, Italy's largest textile manufacturer which makes 62 per cent of its sales outside its home market, forecast a 'considerable increase' in full-year profits as it finally began to benefit from the devaluation. Most entrepreneurs believe the lira is now slightly undervalued, but they dismiss accusations that for the past two years they have been operating at an unfair advantage compared with European and international competitors. Mr Gian Carlo Vaccari, chief executive of Sasib, the railway equipment and machinery manufacturer which is part of Mr Carlo De Benedetti's Cir group, says: 'In the 1980s we had to operate with a loss of competitivity - fixed exchange rates and an increasing cost of labour. Now the lira has returned to its true value.' But it would be wrong to assume that Italian industry has waited passively for a change in the economic environment. Analysts agree that most large Italian companies have worked hard to cut costs and restructure. Olivetti, for example, which has had to cope with the special pressures on the world computer market, had some 59,000 employees in 1989, and expects to have reduced this number to 33,000 by the middle of next year. That is a net decrease, but the company has also taken on staff from outside to introduce new blood into the group as it seeks to manoeuvre itself into the related areas of multimedia and telecommunications. Fiat has cut staff from 300,000 in 1990, to 260,000 in 1993; Pirelli from 50,000 to 40,000 in the past two years. All three companies have also attacked costs, and pursued innovation. Analysts were impressed by Olivetti's claim at the half-year stage to have reduced sales, general and administrative costs from 28 per cent in 1992, to 20.5 per cent. The target is to reach 18 per cent in 1995. Fiat, meanwhile, is 'outsourcing' some of its automotive business and has just decided to merge Magneti Marelli and Gilardini, its two automotive components subsidiaries, as rationalisation continues. Fiat Auto, the main subsidiary, is half way through the programme of renewing its range, beginning last year with the successful Fiat Punto. Pirelli is laying the emphasis on new cables, using high technology fibre optics, for the multimedia market, and has increased the pace of new product development in both the cable and tyre divisions. Ferruzzi-Montedison's restructuring has been more hectic, as it has picked itself up following last year's near-collapse. In his letter to shareholders earlier this year, Mr Guido Rossi, chairman of both Ferfin and Montedison, described the rescue plan instituted with the co-operation of the banks as 'the largest out-of-court financial restructuring in history, in terms of the scale of the indebtedness rescheduled, its geographic dimensions and the number of parties involved'. But even under pressure, Montedison has managed to raise L1,100bn since last year by selling off non-core businesses while Ferfin has cut its debt in the first half by nearly 30 per cent. It has not been an easy task: the Ferruzzi-Montedison structure contains some 1,800 different companies, many dormant investment vehicles set up by the now discredited previous management which must be ditched or wound up. It would be unwise, however, to overstate the strength of Italian industry, and particularly the big companies, at this early stage in the recovery. Restructuring of Italy's public sector, through privatisation, has slowed down under the Berlusconi government, particularly in industrial sectors such as telecoms (Stet), energy and chemicals (Eni), and electricity (Enel). This is not only a disappointment to analysts, but could prove a handicap if these companies want to take advantage of the improved climate to make international alliances. And once they have shaken off recession, rinsed out the bad taste left by corruption, and completed the process of restructuring, international competition is still intense for Italian companies already in the private sector. They are not the only industrial companies to have undergone substantial restructuring during the downturn. In addition, they are still underweight compared with companies from other similar sized and even smaller economies. Generali, the Italian insurer, is the only Italian group to make it into the list of the world's 100 largest public companies. This need not matter for the overall Italian economy, which draws strength from the performance of its small and medium-sized enterprises, often family-owned, but it must worry the bigger Italian players. It would be better to conclude, then, with a note of caution struck by the director-general of Fiat, Mr Giorgio Garuzzo. Asked if there was a risk of complacency setting in at Fiat as the economic situation improved, he replied: 'I think we're still a long way away from that.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Excerpts] U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher will  begin a new tour of the region within days in a mission aimed at  advancing the peace process. The U.S. secretary's visit comes  after a lengthy halt in the Washington peace talks and in the  wake of a premeditated Israeli attempt to conceal the peace  process behind a thick wall of blood and fire. Meanwhile, the  Israeli rulers stabbed the peace process in the back, undermined  it, and derailed it from the bases set for it. This has created  a gloomy and disappointing atmosphere, making it hard to be  optimistic about the possibility of advancing the peace process  and extricating it from the difficult situation created by the  Israeli rulers.    Perhaps the phrase advancing the peace process has been  rendered meaningless. It has been repeated so many times  without any really positive result. U.S. officials have made  many journeys between Washington and the region in a mission  they call advancing the peace process, or helping the parties  overcome difficulties and return to the negotiating table. This  is because those officials' tours, visits, and talks have not  gone beyond a mailman's mission. They have not placed the  wheels of the peace train on the track to the aspired and set  objective of a just, comprehensive peace.    There is a great difference between the mission of advancing  the peace process and a mailman's mission. There is a great  difference between the role of a full partner and impartial  broker on the one hand and the role of a silent partner ignoring  Israel's evasion of the objectives of the U.S. initiative and  disavowal of its bases and frameworks. The full-partner role  the United States has chosen to play has not led to a change in  the role played by U.S. officials. Thus, it has been revealed  that the U.S. partner is a partner only in terms of complaining  about the halt in the negotiations and about the looming  difficulties and obstacles. Besides, this partner evades the  requirements of this partnership, represented by the need to  call for adopting the bases set for the peace process and  respecting international legitimacy and its resolutions.    Moreover, two days ago, a U.S. official called on the Arabs  to appease Israel, fully normalize relations with it, to end the  Arab boycott, and to meet other similar requests previously made  by the Israeli rulers. This shows Washington absolutely adopts  the requests of one party, and absolutely ignores the requests  of the other party. It seems the memory of some Washington  officials is weak. They do not remember, or rather do not want  to remember, that the party occupying others' territory is  Israel, that the party confiscating others' rights is Israel,  that the party that launched aggressive wars is Israel, that the  party that defied the resolutions of international legitimacy is  Israel, and that the party that rejected the bases of the peace  process and conspired against it is Israel. On the other hand,  the Arabs have been the victims of the Israeli rulers'  aggression, expansionist policy, and constant threat of using  weapons, including weapons of mass destruction. In this case,  we ask: Who is required to prove their good intentions: The  Arabs or Israel? The Arabs have accepted UN resolutions and  cooperated with all international initiatives to establish  peace. The Arabs did all that in a quest for a just,  comprehensive peace. No peace can be established and last  unless it is just and comprehensive. However, others should  know that the desire for peace cannot lead the Arabs to  capitulate to the law- breaking Israeli rulers. Nor can it lead  the Arabs to accepting that dictates are imposed on them, as  wished by Rabin and those who sympathize with him. [passage  omitted]    However, what happened after the Geneva meeting between  Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton made many parts of the  world news media pose a legitimate question about whether the  U.S. Middle East policy is drawn by the elected U.S. President,  who has adopted the peace process and its bases and called for a  just, comprehensive peace, or by other parties who want to  appease Israel at the expense of the Arabs and their rights,  justice, peace, and international legitimacy.

			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / European Diary: Zurich stalls in effort to rewrite highway code - Drivers draw battle lines and give the hard shoulder to proposed car-free zone / Switzerland ZURICH'S socialist-green coalition, in control of the city for the past six years, has been one of the most aggressive in Europe in its attempts to discourage the use of cars. Its experiences are sobering for other cities considering traffic curbing measures. Zurich's traffic engineers have built bewildering one way mazes, raised speed bumps everywhere and eliminated vehicle lanes in favour of more space for bicycles, trams and pedestrians. The council has financed an efficient new commuter train network to the suburbs and the council has banned the creation of new parking places in the city. Recently, it has taken to removing existing parking places by stealth. Hardly a week goes by without a few street parking places being replaced overnight by bollards and trees. This summer, the council has resorted to trying to provoke feelings of guilt  -mounting posters on the outskirts of the city, shouting 'Zuviel Ozon' (Too Much Ozone), imploring people to abandon their cars and use trams or bicycles in the city. The most significant gain is that the city has a wonderful public transportation system, with smooth trams that roll for the most part uninhibited on reserved lanes, and whose drivers have the power to turn traffic lights in their favour. The system is also extremely successful, winning some 300m passengers a year within a population basin of little more than half a million. But the use of cars for commuting into the city has continued to rise. According to the town council, the number of cars registered in the city has risen from 130,000 in 1986 to 141,000 last year. In addition, the number of motor units (a measure which reduces lorries to car equivalents) coming into the city every day averages 474,000, roughly 150,000 more than the city's population. Perhaps the biggest failure of the programme is that it has riled the city's business community to the extent that several attempts to enlarging downtown pedestrian areas have been stymied. The businessmen favour more pedestrian precincts but insist that parking places lost in the greened streets be replaced one for one in adjacent streets or with new multi-storey car parks. The town council insists that the operation must be used to reduce further the total number of parking places available. The council has twice proposed closing off the whole centre of town to cars for the summer months, but this has been rejected by the Conservative cantonal government as impractical. 'They imagined barriers - rather like Checkpoint Charlie - with every car driver being checked to see whether he had a personal parking space in the centre or if he was a doctor on an errand of mercy,' says Mr Hans Georg Luchinger, the recently retired president of the Zurich Vereinigung (chamber of commerce). The chief strategist of Zurich's war on cars is its councillor for transport, Mr Rudolf Aeschbacher, who makes no apologies for his aggressive approach. A cycling enthusiast, he believes there is simply no point in trying to satisfy the driving fraternity. 'We have to reduce the actual ability of people to drive in and to town. If you keep facilities at the same level, people will stay in their cars,' he says. He points to one main artery entering the city from a motorway where the city deliberately reduced the capacity from two lanes to one. 'We immediately had a 35 per cent reduction of traffic coming in. We wanted to do it on other arteries, but the cantonal government overruled us. 'When it becomes less attractive to drive into town, people will start taking the train,' he states. Thus, he refuses to improve the road system. 'We say that we cannot afford to have a good public transport system and a very good road system. The road system should only be big enough for things that have to be done with a car, and my view is that probably only 30 to 40 per cent of what is being done now in cars is necessary.' Mr Aeschbacher's policies have ignited so much anger among Zurich's middle classes that they have given unexpected staying power to a fringe political organisation called the Automobile Party. The party was created in 1985 in response to a short-lived national anti-car campaign by Greens, but it still claims 8,000 active members and has eight seats in the federal parliament and two in the Zurich cantonal government. Mr Michael Dreher, president of the party's federal parliamentary group, gives no corner to Mr Aeschbacher. 'We think a car should be either moving or parked, not looking for a parking space. The right to choose your means of travel is a basic human right.' In Mr Dreher's view, the chamber of commerce and Mr Luchinger are 'softies', and the Zurich anti-car policy based on a misconception. 'Zurich has the cleanest air of all European cities. In 1985, they tried to tell us that the forests were dying because of cars. They were lying. Now they tell us about the greenhouse effect. Sober common sense in this country has disappeared.' Far from being distressed about this political force, Mr Aeschbacher seems to like it. 'Now we know for how many people cars are the absolute priority. It is five to six per cent of the vote. If we did not have that party, we would not know.' Mr Aeschbacher also has some unexpected allies. Last spring, Nissan Motor launched a promotion in which any purchaser of a new Nissan car would get a year's pass on the Zurich public transportation system, worth SFr1,328 (Pounds 524.90) for only SFr100. 'Going by tram is okay and going by car is okay. It is a matter of getting the proportions right and using moderation,' Nissan and the Zurich public transport authority said in their joint advertisements. Even the cantonal government may be moving his way. Recent research by its statistical department confirmed that it was proving very difficult to pull Zurich's rich suburban commuters out of their BMWs and Mercedes. The researchers concluded that the only solutions were slower roads and fewer parking places. 'As long as a driver can arrive at his destination in a reasonable time and find somewhere to park, there is no way he is going to change his habits,' they said.</p>

An amendment to this petition was received on April 4, 1994, which changed the proposed exemption by including the genetic material necessary for the production of these proteins. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The squash plants identified as Asgrow line ZW20 have been genetically modified to produce the coat proteins of two viruses which commonly infect squash plants (watermelon mosaic virus-2 and zucchini yellow mosaic virus). Production of specific viral coat proteins by the plant will protect it from infection by those viruses. Viral coat proteins, along with the genetic material (nucleic acids) necessary to produce them in the plant, are designated as plant pesticides by EPA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The data submitted in the petition and all other relevant material have been evaluated. The data considered in support of the exemption from the requirement of a tolerance include the following: Sequences of the engineered WMV2 and ZYMV coat protein coding regions and their resulting coat proteins, Southern blots to show absence of NPT2 gene and non-T-DNA sequences in ZW 20 squash, levels of WMV2 and ZYMV coat protein deduced from amino acid sequence, and levels of viral coat proteins in fruit collected from local markets. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency agrees with the petitioner's contention that components of plant pathogenic viruses, as represented by the protein coats of zucchini yellow mosaic virus and watermelon mosaic virus-2, present no health concerns when expressed in edible portions of the plant. The data include evidence to support the lack of any NPT2 marker gene in the ZW20 plants. Therefore, the only transgene expressed is the viral coat protein. The submitted data include results of tests to determine the levels of the proteins in market-ready fruit from line ZW20 and related this information to the normal levels of these viruses in cucurbit fruits pruchased at local markets. These data demonstrated that, overall, the levels of viral coat proteins in locally grown cucurbit plants were higher than those expressed in the transgenic squash.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for specific viral coat proteins WMV2 and ZYMV is based on the following: (1) Virus-infected plants have always been a part of the human and domestic animal food supply since most crops are frequently infected with plant viruses, and food from these crops has been and is being consumed without observed adverse human health effects; (2) plant viruses have never been shown to be infectious to humans or mammals. Plant viruses are not able to replicate in mammals or other vertebrates. Thus, there is no possibility of human infection. In addition, only the portion of the viral genome coding for the whole coat protein or a subcomponent of the coat protein will be expressed in the ZW20 plants. This portion by itself is incapable of forming infectious particles. Since whole intact plant viruses are not known to cause deleterious human health effects, it is reasonable to assume that a subunit of these viruses likewise will not cause adverse human health effects. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Asgrow Seed Co. amended its petition to include the genetic material necessary for the production of the proteins because EPA considers such genetic material to be part of the plant-pesticide product. It is the genetic material that is introduced into the plant with the intent that it will ultimately result in a pesticidal effect (i.e., the plant will produce the viral coat protein). Moreover, the pesticidal proteins could not be produced without the genetic material being present in the plant. The exemption from a tolerance for the genetic material which codes for the production of the viral coat proteins is based on the fact that the nucleic acids which form the genetic material are found in all foods and have not, by themselves, been associated with toxic or pathogenic effects on animals and humans. None of these constituents of nucleic acids are know to be acute toxicants by themselves but, like proteins and other normal constituents of food, may cause indirect, adverse metabolic effects if consumed exclusively at high doses over a long period of time in the absence of a normal balanced diet. Nucleic acids will not occur at these high amounts in ZW20 plants. Thus, EPA does not believe there is any potential for adverse health effects related to the consumption of the ZW20 plants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The data and information submitted with this petition are acceptable and are adequate to show that there are no forseeable human or domestic health hazards likely to arise from the consumption of fruit from the Asgrow line ZW20 of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cucurbita pepo <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  L. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Acceptable daily intake (ADI) and maximum permissible intake (MPI) considerations are not relevant to this petition because the data submitted demonstrate that these plant pesticides are not toxic to humans. No enforcement actions are expected based upon the level of residues of viral coat proteins and the genetic material necessary for their production. Therefore, the requirement for an analytical method for enforcement purposes is not applicable to this exemption request. This will be the first exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for this plant pesticide. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The plant pesticides in the Asgrow squash line ZW20 are considered useful for the purpose for which the exemption from the requirement of a tolerance is sought. Based on the information considered, the Agency concludes that establishment of the exemption will protect the public health. Therefore, the regulation is proposed as set forth below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposed rule.

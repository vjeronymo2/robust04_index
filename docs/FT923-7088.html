			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Observer: A Masters in show-biz Wherever there is money and celebrity press clippings, it is a near certainty Alan Dershowitz will not be far behind. So, as the Mia Farrow-Woody Allen bust-up descends into increasingly murky territory, it is no surprise to find the 53-year-old lawyer taking centre-stage. In this case, Dershowitz - author of legal tracts such as Chutzpah 1991 - is acting for Farrow. So far, his public role has been to act as her spokesman, emphasising her laudable desire to have the whole business resolved in private. It may turn out to be one of his more sympathetic cases: Dershowitz has recently defended Mike Tyson, who is serving a prison sentence for rape, hotel queen Leona Helmsley, in prison for tax evasion, Mike Milken, the jailed junk bond king, and TV preacher Jim Bakker. He certainly gets the high profile clients. But it's more difficult to judge how well he has done. Perhaps the irony is that Dershowitz - who sprang to fame when he successfully defended Claus von Bulow against attempted murder charges in the early-1980s - has been described in the past as 'a Woody Allen look-alike'. It was 'Reversal of Fortune', which starred Jeremy Irons and was based on the von Bulow case, which made him a household name. How many other Harvard professors are as well known as Dershowitz?</p>

			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / International Capital Markets: 'Flex' deals offered on FT-SE Mid 250 OMLX, the London-based equity derivatives exchange, is to launch both standard and 'flex' futures and option contracts on the FT-SE Mid 250 index. This steals a march on the London International Financial Futures &amp; Options Exchange (Liffe), which has also been granted a licence by the London stock exchange to trade Mid 250 derivatives. 'Flex,' or flexible contracts - which can be tailored to individual needs, like over-the-counter products, but which are cleared through an exchange - have already been introduced in the US market, but the OMLX instruments will be the first of their kind in the UK. 'What we discovered is that there is not a huge demand for one specific use, but for a range of uses,' said Mr Lynton Jones, OMLX chief executive. These uses include asset allocation, hedging existing portfolios, writing options against stock holdings to enhance returns, and playing the spread between the FT-SE 100 and 250 indices or the cash market. OMLX said it expected to launch the contracts in a matter of weeks. Liffe has not yet formulated its plans for Mid 250 derivatives. 'We believe that the timing is very important,' said Liffe chief executive, Mr Daniel Hodson. 'We are still engaged in looking at the alternatives.' These include listing Mid 250 futures on its APT screen trading system. Liffe is also developing an options trading system, which could be used for the Mid 250, including 'flex' options.</p>

			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Outsider to head school inspectors MR JOHN PATTEN, education secretary, surprised the teaching establishment yesterday by appointing Professor Stewart Sutherland, a leading university administrator, as chief inspector of schools in England, Andrew Adonis writes. The chief inspector's powers were greatly increased earlier this year, giving control over the expanded - and soon to be semi-privatised - inspection regime for schools. Prof Sutherland will take up the post in September. A philosopher of religion, his career has been largely spent in academic posts and university administration. The appointment of an outsider was criticised by teachers' unions. Mr Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the NASUWT union, said: 'It shows that the inspectorate is going to be no more than an administrative machine.' The government released an extra Pounds 4.4m yesterday to help councils upgrade facilities in schools.</p>

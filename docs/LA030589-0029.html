			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A FRESH MEMORY  </P> <P> Every year, at Grammy award time, we are reminded by Robert Hilburn of the  "travesty" when the Captain and Tennille won their Grammy in 1975 for "Love  Will Keep Us Together."  </P> <P> I always kind of wondered why Hilburn was so disturbed by this; after all, 14  years have passed. Then, lo and behold, there was the answer in a chart that  ran with "At Long Last, the Grammys Grow Up," his Feb. 19 article: "Love Will  Keep Us Together" edged out "Born to Run" by Hilburn's all-time fave, Bruce  Springsteen!  </P> <P> ROBERT DANA  </P> <P> Burbank  </P></p>

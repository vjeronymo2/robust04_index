			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE EFFORT TO RECALL FOUNTAIN VALLEY COUNCILMAN VOSS  </P> <P> When we voted Fountain Valley City Councilman Fred Voss into public office, we  did so with a number of expectations. We expected him to represent the majority  of us in deciding matters within his jurisdiction.  </P> <P> We expected him to show, by example, the way we are to go. We expected him to  exhibit exemplary personal, moral, ethical and professional traits toward which  we may all aspire.  </P> <P> We expect to hold Voss accountable for his performance with respect to these  issues while in public office.  </P> <P> It is my belief, and the belief of a very large number of other Fountain Valley  residents who signed petitions to place a measure on the November ballet to  consider his recall, that Voss, as a result of poor judgment and questionable  moral character, has forfeited his right to represent the citizens of this city  and this caused us to doubt the soundness of his judgment in deciding issues  regarding our interests.  </P> <P> Any leader given to compromise in his personal life is subject to lack of  discernment in his public life as well. A leader of character, when guilty of  wrongdoing, is more sorry for the offense than for getting caught. It is our  right and duty as citizens to vote yes for recall.  </P> <P> LARRY S. SOCEA  </P> <P> Fountain Valley  </P></p>

			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Criminal injury changes attacked The government was forced on to the defensive yesterday by Labour attacks on plans to speed up the criminal injuries compensation scheme, Kevin Brown writes. Mr John Major defended the government's plans to replace individual assessments with a tariff scheme during question-time exchanges. The prime minister said the changes, which will take effect in April, would make the system more efficient and speed up payments to claimants. But it later emerged that the changes would reduce the annual bill for compensation payments from about Pounds 500m a year to Pounds 250m by the year 2000. The government expects 46 per cent of claimants to be worse off under the new system.</p>

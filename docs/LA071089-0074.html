			<p><P> July 10, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ALL-STAR GAME: MEDIA;  </P> <P> BROADCAST ARMADA SAILS INTO ANAHEIM -- EVEN FAN REAGAN  </P> <P> When broadcast giant Red Barber called his first All-Star game more than half a  century ago, featuring the likes of Lou (the Iron Horse) Gehrig and Jimmie  (Double X) Foxx, he had little in the way of high-tech gadgetry or armies of  assistants to aid him.  </P> <P> "There wasn't anything terribly exciting or dramatic about it," the now-retired  Barber -- longtime voice of the Brooklyn Dodgers -- recalled in a recent  interview from his Florida home. "You went into a cramped little (radio) booth  with a single sound engineer, and you broadcast the game. It was that simple."  </P> <P> Today, more than the score card has changed.  </P> <P> When the national spotlight shines Tuesday on Anaheim for the 60th playing of  baseball's annual All-Star game, a staggering array of nearly a thousand print  and broadcast media representatives will be on hand to relay the balls and  strikes, the highlights and trivia notes, to millions of fans around the world  in words, pictures and sounds.  </P> <P> NBC -- the media outlet for an estimated 51 million people who will watch the  game live -- is spending $8 million to import 90 production people, a Goodyear  blimp camera, 12 stationary cameras, two hand-held minicams, 13 videotape  replay machines, 3 1/2 miles of audio cable and more.  </P> <P> The "and more" in this case includes ex-Chicago Cubs announcer Ronald Reagan,  who will be making what NBC officials say is a broadcast first when the former  President gives a special on-the-air appearance in the booth.  </P> <P> Posing potential problems for the network, however, are late-afternoon shadows  -- a result of the 5:35 p.m. game time necessary to capture the East Coast  prime-time viewing audience.  </P> <P> "Those aren't ideal conditions to televise a game in or to watch it in, but  there's not much we could do," said Kevin Monoghan, sports information director  for NBC.  </P> <P> Shadows or not, the extravaganza marks a chance for Angels planners to show the  viewing world that there is a place called Orange County that is distinct from  Los Angeles and Disneyland.  </P> <P> Team information director Tim Meade, coordinating press coverage, said that  with the eyes of the baseball world generally focused on Los Angeles and the  Dodgers, "a lot of people forget about the California Angels and this part of  the Southland. This is our chance to make them remember, and we're not going to  waste that opportunity."  </P> <P> Toward that end, the team brought in Johnny Grant, the Emmy-winning producer  who oversees the Hollywood Walk of Fame, to orchestrate a weeklong series of  parades, tributes and other events at Anaheim Stadium that will culminate in  Tuesday's game.  </P> <P> "We wanted to make this into a kind of jubilee in celebration of this whole  area and what it has to offer," Grant said.  </P> <P> "You can't measure what this attention means to Orange County," added Steve  Bailey, who has announced baseball games locally for KMPC since 1951. "It  further establishes the area as a home to major league baseball and a growing  urban center in its own right. Just think of all the stories that will be  coming out of here with an Anaheim dateline on them."  </P> <P> Among the destinations for those stories, baseball officials said, will be  Japan, Latin America, and -- for the first time for an All-Star game -- the  Soviet Union, which has reporters from its Tass news agency in town to cover  the event.  </P> <P> The media rush on Anaheim began in earnest Sunday, as dozens of reporters,  cameramen and others in the industry filtered into the Anaheim Hilton to  collect their press credentials for the game. Major league baseball expects to  give out more than 700 credentials, in addition to those taken by NBC.  </P> <P> Among them are representatives of local newspapers and broadcast stations  around the United States and Canada who are in Anaheim to keep a close eye on  the performances of their hometown players and to gather quotes from those  players afterward.  </P> <P> Also on hand are special-interest media representatives, such as: Curt Clemons,  who will do pre- and post-game interviews with black All-Stars for New York  radio station WWRL and 107 other black-oriented stations across the country;  Ismael G. Reyes of Houston, who will give Spanish-speaking listeners around the  United States and Latin America a close look at the Latino ballplayers, and  Kenneth V. Allan of Burbank, who will report back to U.S. troops around the  world through Armed Forces radio and TV.  </P> <P> "My job," said Clemons, "is to see that the black players -- the guys who might  not get on the air otherwise -- are heard and seen by our listeners."  </P> <P> While the task of getting hundreds of media people to their accommodations  promptly, getting them credentials and helping them set up might seem a  logistical nightmare, team officials and others involved in the processed say  preparations are going smoothly so far.  </P> <P> "You always report back on how you're treated by the host city," said Reyes of  the Spanish-language network, "and so far everyone's been very courteous and  helpful. It's been terrific, and I've really been impressed with the whole  area."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, Feb 16 (TANJUG) -- President of the  Republic of Serb Krajina (RSK) Milan Martic, in his letter of  protest to French President Francois Mitterrand, warns him that  his government is to be blamed for the possible fresh genocide  of Serbs because of a partial policy of Paris towards the  Serbian people and their states which emerged from the collapse  of ex-Yugoslavia.    France has waged a strong campaign for the NATO forces to  air  raid positions of the Serbs in the ex-Yugoslav republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    On February 9, NATO 'succumbed' to France's pressure but, to  the disappointment of Paris, it threatened with air strikes  equally against the Bosnian Muslims as well as the Bosnian Serbs  unless they withdraw by February 20 their heavy weapons in and  around Sarajevo, or regroup them and place them under UNPROFOR  (U.N. Protection Force) control.    In his letter to Mitterrand, monitored by the RSK news  agency  ISKRA, Martic is confident that the current French policy will  lose the battle because it contradicts the spirit of France's  freedom, not because it is unjust towards the Serbs.    Martic said that back in 1876 the celebrated French poet  Victor Hugo accused Europe of helping to annihilate Serbs in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and that he sought protection for Serbs while  European civilization would save its face.    Martic also recalled the notable French politicians and  generals in the past who were enthusiastic about the way the  Serbs were fighting on their side in World War One.    "May I remind you that the Serbian people have built a  monument to the French state, perhaps the only such monument in  the world. It represents France as the state of victory and  democracy, with which the Serbian people were allied in the two  world wars," Martic writes.    Last January, Martic was elected president of the RSK, the  state proclaimed in predominantly Serb-populated parts of the  former Croatia in response to its violent secession and its  attempt to reduce their civil and national rights.</p>

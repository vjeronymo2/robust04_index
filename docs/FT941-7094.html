			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / National pay deal for print industry Unions and employers in the printing industry have concluded a new national agreement only a year after abandoning national bargaining, David Goodhart writes. The British Printing Industry Federation said that agreement had been reached on an increase of Pounds 5 a week for a skilled worker and Pounds 4.65 and Pounds 4.43 for less skilled employees. The GPMU print union calculates that the increase will represent a rise of about 3 per cent for most print workers. The deal introduces full flexibility between employees in grades previously covered by the NGA craft union and those covered by the Sogat general union. It covers about 100,000 employees.</p>

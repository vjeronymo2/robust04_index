			<p><P> November 19, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> BENEFIT NOTED IN PRE-GAME SEX  </P> <P> A psychology professor says having sex the night before a big game can improve  an athlete's performance -- provided he or she does not get carried away.  </P> <P> University of British Columbia Prof. Susan Butt, Canada's top-ranked female  tennis player in the 1960s, said sex is a form of exercise and the same rules  about overtraining apply as in sports.  </P> <P> "Depending on the athlete's personality and physical makeup, sexual activity  within reason might even enhance his or her performance," she told Reuters in  an interview.  </P> <P> "Too much exhausting activity wouldn't be recommended for anybody," said Butt,  whose findings are published in a recent issue of Sports Medicine, a scientific  journal published in New Zealand.  </P> <P> The findings were developed from a comprehensive review of the literature on  the subject that includes references to more than 70 authors ranging from  Sigmund Freud to Masters and Johnson.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Bratislava SLOVENSKA REPUBLIKA in  Slovak on 18 June on page 2 carries an 800-word Jergus Ferko  article entitled "Monument for a Traitor." The article deals  with the controversy over the unveiling of a plaque for Count  Janos Esterhazy, an ethnic Hungarian politician who was  sentenced to death for "high treason" in 1947, organized by the  local organization of the Hungarian Christian Democratic  Movement (MKDH) at Senec, western Slovakia.    According to the article, the ceremony was to take place on  19 June at Senec, a town in which ethnic Hungarians make up 27  percent of the population, and was to be addressed by MKDH  Deputy Pal Csaky and Esterhazy's daughter Alice. However, the  preparations triggered protests from the local organization of  the Slovak Heritage Foundation. According to Ferko, Slovak  Heritage Foundation members from Senec were pointing out that,  "by his political activity, Count Esterhazy contributed to the  occupation of southern Slovakia (including Senec) by Horthy's  fascist army and to the subsequent seizure of this territory by  Hungary. After the war, he was proved guilty of antistate  espionage for Budapest and sentenced for high treason." The  protests of the local branch of the Slovak Heritage Foundation  reportedly received backing from the Slovak Heritage Foundation  leadership, which issued a statement saying that, "after the  founding of the first Slovak Republic (in 1939), Esterhazy was  pushing for the concept of renewing Greater Hungary."    Before deciding on the matter, the article continues, J.  Elsik, the mayor of Senec, asked the Bratislava City Court for  its assessment of the case. In a written statement, the City  Court reportedly stated that the verdict of 1947 (which was  subsequently changed to a life sentence; Esterhazy finally died  in prison in 1957) remains valid and that Count Esterhazy is  therefore to be considered a "traitor." The article goes on to  say: "On Thursday, 16 June, a meeting of the Senec City Council  was convened with only one item on the agenda: to permit or not  to permit the plaque. After a `complicated debate' (as is stated  in the minutes of the meeting) and in the presence of Pal Csaky,  deputy of the National Council of the Slovak Republic, the City  Council finally decided not to allow the erection of the plaque."    In conclusion, Ferko expresses the conviction that "those  Senec residents of Hungarian nationality who regard Slovakia as  their homeland--and I suppose this applies to the overwhelming  majority of them--will receive the decision of the municipal  deputies with understanding. And they will surely also realize  that, once again, someone wanted to turn them into extras for  his dubious political game. Our southern Slovakia really needs  to refresh its historical memory--in a different direction,  however: by renewing the destroyed monuments to Czechoslovak  legionnaires who died while defending this territory against a  Hungarian invasion in 1919."    Bratislava SLOVENSKY DENNIK in Slovak on 18 June on page 2,  in the "Single Question" column, carries a 150-word reply by  MKDH Deputy Pal Csaky to a SLOVENSKY DENNIK reporter's question  about the decision of the Senec City Council. Csaky says: "I  was present at the meeting of the City Council on Thursday.  Following a stormy discussion, we decided not to unveil the  plaque, on which the inscription reads: `Let Us Act Together in  Love and Understanding.' It is not the right time to commemorate  someone when national passions are running high, especially if  the whole situation is incompatible with this motto."</p>

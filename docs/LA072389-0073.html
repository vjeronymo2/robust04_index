			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Costa Rica has barred former White House aide Oliver L. North and former U.S.  National Security Adviser John M. Poindexter from entering its territory after  a yearlong parliamentary probe into arms and drugs smuggling, Information  Minister Jorge Urbina said in San Jose, the nation's capital. Also banned from  the country were ex-U.S. Ambassador Lewis A. Tambs, arms dealer Richard V.  Secord and former CIA Costa Rica station chief Joseph F. Fernandez, Urbina  said. A lower house committee said it believed they were in some way involved  in arms and drug smuggling, but gave no specific evidence.  </P></p>

			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / International Company News: Strong sales lift Texas Instruments to Dollars 2.5bn Texas Instruments, the US semiconductor and electronics manufacturer, reported record second-quarter results, driven by strong sales of semiconductor products.

Profits from operations were Dollars 292m, up from Dollars 173m, while net income was Dollars 184m, or Dollars 1.93 a share, against Dollars 112m, or Dollars 1.18. Semiconductor revenues rose by 29 per cent, with strong growth in memory chip revenues. 'The Asia-Pacific region continues to be the fastest growing semiconductor market in the world,' TI said. Half-year revenues were Dollars 4.96bn, up 24 per cent from Dollars 3.99bn a year earlier. Net income was Dollars 318m, or Dollars 3.35 a share, against Dollars 192m, or Dollars 2.04.

			<p>921022 FT  22 OCT 92 / Observer: Risky Globe-trotting insurance broker Bob Naudi appears to be leaving a trail of disaster in his wake. On October 12 he left Cairo hours before the city was devastated by an earthquake. At the end of last week Naudi, who is a managing director at Alexander Howden Reinsurance Brokers, was attending to clients in northern Colombia. Within hours of his departure, the area suffered two earthquakes. Naudi, who speaks seven languages, is not expecting his normally warm welcome when he next goes abroad. But where is he going? 'We don't care as long as he doesn't stay here,' says a nervous colleague.</p>

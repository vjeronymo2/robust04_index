			<p><P> November 27, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HOLYFIELD WINS ROUND VERSUS WBC IN COURT  </P> <P> World Boxing Council cannot strip heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield of his  title for fighting former champion George Foreman, a judge ruled today.  </P> <P> Citing the WBC's own bylaws, Superior Court Judge Amos Saunders said it would  be unsportsmanlike conduct for the organization to strip Holyfield of his title  because it was tantamount to taking the side of former champion Mike Tyson in  the dispute.  </P> <P> Holyfield knocked out James (Buster) Douglas in Las Vegas last month to take  the title. He signed a contract to defend the title against former champion  George Foreman on April 19.  </P> <P> The WBC wanted Holyfield to defend against Tyson, and had threatened to strip  Holyfield of his WBC title if he fought Foreman first.  </P> <P> At one point the WBC, the World Boxing Assn. and International Boxing  Federation declared that the winner of Holyfield-Douglas fight must defend the  title against Tyson.  </P> <P> But the WBA and IBF switched course and sanctioned the Foreman-Holyfield fight.  </P> <P> Both the WBA and the IBF have said that if Holyfield wins in April, he would  have to then fight the No. 1 contender, who is certain to be Tyson.  </P> <P> The WBC did not send lawyers to argue its case.  </P> <P> In an affidavit included in the 27-page brief, Holyfield said, "If the WBC  follows through with its threat to strip me of the title I won fairly in the  ring, it would be of grave injury to me for which there can be no fair  compensation."  </P></p>

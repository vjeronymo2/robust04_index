			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Bond market worries drive share prices lower - Market Report The market's worries over interest rates, allayed at first by favourable statistics on UK industrial output, increased sharply yesterday afternoon when the German bond market fell sharply. British government bonds quickly followed suit and a stock market already showing a double-digit loss plunged in the final two hours of trading to challenge the Footsie 3,200 mark. At the final reading of 3,205.4 the FT-SE 100-share Index was down a net 36.1, and only a shade above the day's low. Trading volume, unexceptional at first, gathered pace in the late sell-off and at least one sell programme was reported. The brunt of the market setback came among the blue chips, which were the most closely linked to selling in the stock index futures sector. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index closed 6.3 down at 3,782.4. In very early deals, the Footsie gained more than 8 points as investors continued to respond to indications that economic growth remains restrained, and will thus put less pressure for higher interest rates at today's scheduled meeting between the UK chancellor of the exchequer and the Governor of the Bank of England. Market sources indicated at the end of last week that some official advisers might be urging a pre-emptive rise in base rates. The same message appeared to be conveyed in the rise of a mere 0.1 per cent in domestic industrial output in July. However, London was unsettled by the evident uncertainty in German bonds as well as the weakness in both the dollar and sterling. In the previous session, the UK market successfully resisted the interest rate worries clearly present elsewhere in Europe. But London was already succumbing to these worries yesterday morning, as became only too clear when the German bund began to fall. Although the Footsie was around 16 points off by early afternoon, gilts were still steady and there was little pressure on the equity market. This changed dramatically when German bond yields jumped to a 20-month high and UK gilts fell sharply. US bonds also opened lower as the New York markets reopened after Labor Day, although the Dow Industrial Average was only a couple of points off when London went home for the day. The speed of the reaction in the equity market appeared to confirm that investors are now focusing on the view that the interest rate cycle in Europe is on the turn - with the UK regarded as the first in line for a rate uptick. Seaq volume of 573.8m shares was moderate, and compared with 765.5m on Monday when retail business slipped to return a value total of Pounds 1.29bn. Levels of retail business have proved a deceptive guide to institutional activity over the past fortnight. Business in second-line stocks dropped back yesterday to a more normal 55 per cent or so of the day's turnover as Wall Street's reopening brought the big players back into the blue chip internationals. Currency factors kept share prices on the defensive, however. The biggest losses came in the retail, consumer and building industry stocks, which are seen as the most vulnerable to interest rate worries. There was some support for bank shares, however, as London brokers recommended them because of the benefits for bad debt portfolios of the economic recovery. Although investors continued to respond to trading statements, actual or pending, the final slide in the market took most sectors along in its wake. Strategists commented that the market is now showing all the signs of an expected tug-of-war between the benefits of higher company dividends and profits and the prospect of increases in interest rates. 'By the end of this month we should have a better idea of which set of factors is coming out on top,' commented one leading analyst.</p>

			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Brown fears Budget will be 'raid on welfare state' Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, yesterday called on the government to announce the results of its year-long review into social security spending after a leaked Whitehall document showed that officials have been considering how to implement a wide range of cuts. Mr Brown warned that the November Budget could be 'a raid on the welfare state'. He made clear that the defence of social security and health spending would be at the heart of Labour's political campaign this autumn. Earlier this week Mr Jonathan Aitken, the new chief secretary to the Treasury, strongly hinted that housing benefit payments could be reduced in the Budget to rein back the Social Security Department's Pounds 85bn spending programme. However, a leaked DSS document yesterday confirmed that officials have also been pressing ahead with plans to abolish the statutory sick pay subsidy to employers and the industrial injuries compensation scheme for employees, both of which cost the government about Pounds 1.4bn. According to the documents, Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, asked officials late last year to 'make recommendations on a strategy to achieve abolition' of the statutory sick pay scheme. Last year the government ended the policy of providing a sick-pay subsidy to 'large employers' who pay National Insurance contributions of more than Pounds 20,000 a year. But, according to the document, DSS officials have been asked to take this a stage further, abolishing the subsidy for the 750,000 'small employers' who were unaffected by last year's legislation. Such a move could save the government as much as Pounds 700m a year. In addition, another group of officials has been asked to examine 'the scope for transferring the no-fault industrial injuries scheme to employers' and to outline the timetable for such legislation. Under these proposals employers could be forced to bear the full costs of compensating employees who are involved in an accident where the company is not at fault.</p>

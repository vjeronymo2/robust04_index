			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Gould warns of opposition to treaty GROWING opposition by Labour backbenchers to the Maastricht treaty was forecast yesterday by Mr Bryan Gould, one of its leading opponents, Ivor Owen writes. He was an unsuccessful challenger to Mr John Smith for the party leadership. He warned that if the treaty were ratified it would lead to permanently entrenched deflation. Mr Gould recalled that more than 60 Labour MPs joined Conservative Euro-sceptics and MPs from minority parties in voting against the government last May. He predicted that many Labour MPs would vote against the third reading. Mr Gould told a parliamentary press gallery lunch that if the treaty were to be enforced there would be no escape route from handing over to unelected bankers all the key decisions about economic policy. Mr Gould maintained that for Labour to support the treaty would mean the party abandoning its principles.</p>

			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / Bush seeks big cuts in defence spending PRESIDENT George Bush is seeking further big cuts in US defence spending to pay for 'middle class' tax cuts and other measures to revive the economy and bolster his campaign for re-election this year. The 'peace dividend' - to be combined with changes in the budget deficit reduction agreement - is likely to be the centrepiece of Mr Bush's State of the Union address to Congress later this month. Mr Bush is also studying proposals for tax credits to help Americans buy health insurance, a Dollars 2,000 (Pounds 1,098) tax credit for first-time home buyers and tax relief for US companies investing in plant and equipment. The president has faced sharp criticism from Democrats and members of his own Republican party for neglecting domestic issues and failing to produce a growth package to restore public confidence in the economy. Mr Samuel Skinner, White House chief of staff, said in a television interview yesterday that the president had ordered the Pentagon to try to find cuts beyond the 25 per cent reduction in forces planned by 1995. Mr Skinner suggested that further defence savings were likely because the Pentagon's five-year budget was based on assumptions made before the collapse of the former Soviet Union. 'The threat (to the US) has changed,' he said. The defence cuts, which could save up to Dollars 50bn, would be made gradually, starting next year with heavier reductions at the end of the five-year cycle, a senior US official said last month. Major weapons systems such as the B-2 Stealth bomber, the Seawolf attack submarine and the number of active US army divisions, tactical fighter wings and aircraft carrier groups face the axe. These defence cuts would be combined with a request to Congress to modify the 1990 budget deficit reduction agreement which sets spending ceilings for defence, foreign aid and domestic categories. Mr Bush would ask Congress to allow funds to be shifted from defence to domestic initiatives, with some money going to deficit reduction. But the president would insist on maintaining existing caps on total spending, Mr Skinner said. A growing number of influential Democrats and Republicans favour making the budget agreement more flexible. But it is unclear what price the Democratic majority in Congress will demand for allowing Mr Bush to reopen the budget agreement. At the very least, Democrats are likely to seek to increase domestic spending beyond what Mr Bush envisages and to press for higher taxes on the wealthy. One White House counter-option is to introduce means testing for health care benefits, making affluent Americans pay more for federal entitlements, such as the government-funded Medicare programme. The New York Times reported yesterday that Americans earning more than Dollars 125,000 a year could find their Medicare premiums tripled, while other government programmes such as farm price supports for the wealthy could be trimmed.

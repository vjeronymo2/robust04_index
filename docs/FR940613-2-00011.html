NOAA recognizes that the guidance itself is not the enforceable policy. Rather, the obligation of coastal states to comply rests in the language of section 306(d)(14). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Guidance to Implement CZMA Section 306(d)(14) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 306(d)(14) imposes a new requirement for effective public participation only on the state's review of Federal agency consistency determinations for direct Federal activities under section 307(c)(1) of the CZMA and any other state coastal management decisions not now covered by an existing public participation procedure. For applications under state general permits, public participation in the review of administrative procedures or regulations allowing for a general determination of consistency will satisfy the public participation requirement. The public should have an opportunity to comment on a project's relationship with the state coastal management program's goals and policies. NOAA interprets the statute to require the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) States must provide timely public notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) States must issue, or cause to be issued, public notice at the earliest practicable time after the application and/or consistency determination has been received by the lead state coastal management agency, except in cases where earlier public notice on the consistency determinations by the relevant Federal agency meets OCRM's standards for acceptable public notice listed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) A public comment period must be provided. The length of the comment period may vary in accordance with state or Federal law, and as appropriate for the type of authorization involved. However, the comment period must be sufficient to give the public a meaningful opportunity to develop and provide comments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Public participation, at a minimum, must consist of written public notice and solicitation of public comments. Provision for a public hearing or meeting may also be provided. If a state chooses to use public hearings or public meetings to provide for effective public participation, such hearings or meetings should be held in a location accessible to most interested or affected parties to the maximum extent possible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The written public notice must: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) specify that the proposed activity is subject to review for consistency uunder the policies of the state coastal management program;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) provide sufficient information to serve as a basis for meaningful comment;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) specify a source for additional information; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) specify a contact for submitting comments to the state coastal management program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) At a minimum, the public notice must be provided in the area(s) of the coastal zone likely to be affected by the activity. Procedural options that may be used include, but are not limited to, the options listed below.The use of one or more of the following must also conform with the guidelines set forth in (a) and (b) above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) public notice through an official state gazette; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) public notice through a local newspaper serving areas of coastal zone likely to be affected by the activity;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) public notice through individual state mailings;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) public notice through a state coastal zone management newsletter;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) arrangements between a state coastal management program and appropriate Federal agencies for joint public notice to be provided by the state and Federal agency where direct Federal activities under section 307(c)(1) are involved OCRM also encourages other streamlined procedures for providing public participation. Federal agency notice of a proposed activity would suffice if it meets the guidelines set forth in (a) and (b) above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> W.

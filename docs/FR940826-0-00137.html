			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 110. On reconsideration of this issue, we no longer believe the provision in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Second Report and Order <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , which links the availability of bidding credits for rural telephone companies to their agreement to satisfy an expanded construction requirement, is necessary or appropriate to promote the statutory objectives. We agree with petitioners' assertions that the expanded build-out requirement may have adverse consequences contrary to the purpose of bidding credit provision. We are also concerned that the expanded construction requirement may be unduly burdensome both to rural telephone company licensees and the Commission. In this regard, we are concerned that the accelerated build-out requirement may not be economically feasible in some rural areas and thus may result in frequent forfeitures of the bidding credit amount by rural telephone companies. As discussed more fully below, we now believe that Congress' objectives of promoting investment in and rapid deployment of new technologies and services to rural areas will best be achieved through the use of other provisions such as installment payments, bidding credits (without an expanded build out requirement), and service area partitioning. Thus, we amend our rules to retain flexibility to adopt any of these or other provisions for rural telephone companies on a service-specific basis after considering the characteristics and capital requirements of the particular service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> F. Rural Telephone Company Eligibility for Installment Payments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 111.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Petitions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  SDN, USIN, and NCTA all request that installment payments be extended to rural telephone companies regardless of their status as small businesses. AIDE and Cook Inlet argue that all designated entities should be permitted to pay for their licenses in installment payments irrespective of their size. These parties all object to the decision to limit eligibility for installment payments to small businesses as defined in &sect;1.2110(b)(1), ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  companies with net worth including that of affiliates of $6 million or less and no more than $2 million of annual after-federal-tax profit for the last two years). USIN argues that there is no statutory support in the provisions cited by the Commission as authority for adopting different provisions for one designated entity group as opposed to another. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 112. Citing the legislative history to the Budget Act and H.R. Report No. 103&hyph;111 in particular, USIN also maintains that the statutory purpose of requiring special provisions for designated entities was to promote entry by firms with difficulty in obtaining access to capital. Petitioners maintain that the $6 million net worth/$2 million net revenue standard for installment payment eligibility is too strict and will prevent rural telephone companies from qualifying for the installment payment option although they face significant difficulty in obtaining access to capital. USIN asserts that as a practical matter rural telephone companies may have high levels of non-amortized assets and yet have less capital available for investment than many businesses that meet the small business definition. SDN maintains that rural telephone companies should be eligible for installment payments regardless of whether they qualify as small businesses because they will generally incur higher build out costs with lower revenue streams than other designated entities. According to USIN, a rural telephone company bidding for a license in a capital-intensive service should be eligible for installment payments if its annual revenue are under $100 million. USIN asserts that without installment payments such telephone companies will be unable to bid for broad-coverage licenses as traditional rural telephone company lenders have indicated unwillingness to finance auction bids. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 113. AIDE objects to the determination in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Second Report and Order <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  that limits the installment payment option to small businesses bidding on licenses for ``those smaller spectrum blocks that are most likely to match the business objectives of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> bona fide <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  small businesses.'' <FOOTCITE>156</FOOTCITE>  According to AIDE, such the installment payment option should be available to all designated entities bidding on all licenses. AIDE maintains that Congress did not intend to give the FCC discretion to offer special provisions to some designated entities in some auctions but not in others. AIDE argues, moreover, that these limitations on the availability of installment payments are not justified by the Commission's desire to prevent abuse of its designated entity provisions since there are other safeguards designed specifically for that purpose, such as the rules for disclosure of real parties in interest, the definitional requirements including the assets of affiliates and the financial qualification rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 156 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See Second Report and Order <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  at &para;237. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 114.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  For the reasons set forth below, we deny petitioners' requests to expand the installment payment option to other designated entities irrespective of their economic status. However, we will retain the flexibility to expand or modify the installment payment option on a service-specific basis for other appropriately-sized entities where the spectrum costs and capital infrastructure requirements necessitate their application to other entities. For example, in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Fifth Report and Order <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  we recognized that the substantial expected capital required to acquire and construct broadband PCS licenses warranted expansion of the installment payment option to most entities acquiring licenses in the entrepreneurs' blocks. <FOOTCITE>157</FOOTCITE>  Under the broadband PCS rules, installment payments are available to smaller entities that do not technically qualify as small businesses and an enhanced installment payment option is available to eligible small businesses and businesses owned by women and/or minorities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 157 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See Fifth Report and Order <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  at &para;&para;136&hyph;140. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 115. In the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Second Report and Order, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  we concluded that for some auctions, small businesses would be eligible for installment payments. We noted that by allowing payment in installments, the government would be extending credit to an eligible winning bidder, thus reducing the amount of private financing needed in advance of the auction by a prospective licensee. We noted that this will assist small entities who are likely to have difficulty obtaining adequate private financing. As a result, we concluded that installment payments would be an effective way to promote efficiently the participation of small businesses in the provision of spectrum-based telecommunications service and an effective tool for efficiently distributing licenses and services among geographic areas. <FOOTCITE>158</FOOTCITE>  Thus, we limited application of installment payments to small entities, including such entities that are owned by minorities and/or women. We found that this approach best served the intent of Congress in enacting section 309(j)(4)(A), to avoid a competitive bidding program that has the effect of favoring incumbents, with established revenue streams, over new companies or start-ups. <FOOTCITE>159</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 158 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See Second Report and Order <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  at &para;&para;233&hyph;240. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 159 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  H.R.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Banja Luka, 16 Apr (TANJUG) -- President of the  Srpska republic Radovan Karadzic said in Banja Luka today that  Srpska republic army units had not entered the town of Gorazde  but that all strategic points around Gorazde are in their  "hands."    "I have spoken with our generals who have an insight into  the  situation and they told me that the Muslims have been activating  remote controlled explosive devices in order to create the  impression that we are shelling the town," Karadzic said.    Karadzic said that new air strikes against the Serbs are  possible because "despite being aware that Gorazde is a major  Muslim stronghold, Washington is not satisfied by the degree of  fear manifested by the Serb side."    Karadzic believes that this is the reason why several (UN)  monitors have been left in Gorazde after the evacuation of  UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] members, so that they could be  used as an excuse for air strikes.    Karadzic says Gorazde is no kind of "security zone" but is a  military stronghold. He said the Muslims there have a full  corps of about 15,000 soldiers, as a result of which the Srpska  republic (of Bosnia-Herzegovina) was forced to use a full corps  in order to bring Gorazde under control, he said.    "The international community must finally state whether this  is a protected zone or not," Karadzic believes. Butrus-Ghali  also spoke about the redefining of Gorazde as a protected zone,  "from which they are killing our people on a daily basis."    According to him, the Muslims were much in favor of the  latest offensive, which they began from the ostensible "security  zone of Gorazde," in order to join together a section of  territory stretching from Sarajevo, via this town, to Sandzak,  and later they would seek to reestablish the same system as  before the offensive. [sentence as received]    "We, of course, could not permit this, and now all the  villages on the right bank of the Drina are ours, and here we  will form a Serb municipality of Gorazde," Karadzic said.    Karadzic insists that the way out of the crisis in Gorazde  is  either peace or an escalation of the war in former  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    He confirmed again today that a political communication had  been established with the UN secretary general's special envoy  Yasushi Akashi and that their joint action yesterday "prevented  another world war."    "It is fortunate that we were together yesterday when  General  Rose asked for the bombing of Gorazde again because we were  allegedly endangering UNPROFOR members," Karadzic explained.    "Rose is very dangerous for Europe because he has disastrous  assessments based on false reports he receives and then passes  on."    Karadzic confirmed that relations with UNPROFOR are  suspended  until further notice, i.e., that there will be no contacts  between the Srpska republic and UN military representatives.    He said that some UNPROFOR monitors had been only 500 meters  away from the Serb lines near Gorazde without the knowledge of  the Srpska republic army.    "If they are on Muslim positions without our knowledge then  we consider them to be members of Muslim units and not any kind  of observers," Karadzic said.    In his words, Gorazde is an opportunity for the Muslim  forces  to launch heavy offensive operations on other front lines, too,  by taking advantage of this situation. [sentence as received]    "For the Muslims the most important operations have been  taking place around Gorazde, but they have also mounted  offensives in Kupres, Srbobran, Teslic, Ozren, and Trebava,"  Karadzic said. "They have even scored some minor successes but  our army has managed to eradicate all of them."    The Srpska republic president also stressed that there are  no  hostilities as yet between units of the army of the Srpska  republic and the Croat Defense Council, except in Posavina,  where sporadic skirmishes have been taking place most of the  time anyway.    "There is some possibility of `the corridor' being cut by  some operation from Croatia, in which case we would immediately  declare our unification with the republic of Serb Krajina,"  Karadzic said.    He could not confirm whether NATO forces had occupied Tuzla  Airport, but he said he had reports that aircraft not belonging  to UNPROFOR are landing there.</p>

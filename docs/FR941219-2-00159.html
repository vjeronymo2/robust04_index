The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Purpose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of the proposed rule change is to provide for an enhancement to PACE by providing Phlx specialists the opportunity to effect price improvement for market orders in securities sent through PACE when the spread between the PACE Quote, which reflects the consolidated national best bid and offer, exceeds 1/8 point in any PACE eligible security. The proposed rule change provides for an automatic stop of such orders and a fifteen second execution delay, allowing a Phlx specialist to manually provide for price improvement equal to or better than the stock price. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  Specifically, all round-lot market orders of up to 500 shares and all combined round-lot and odd-lot orders of up to 599 shares will be stopped at the PACE Quote at the time of entry into PACE (stopped at the best bid for sell orders; at the best ask for buy orders) and shall be subject to a delay of up to fifteen seconds from being executed in order to provide an opportunity for price improvement by the Phlx specialist. If a particular market order is not executed within fifteen seconds, the order will be automatically executed by the system at the stop price. If the PACE Quote at the time of order entry reflects a spread between the best bid and offer of 1/8 point, PACE market orders shall be system executed immediately. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly to the Phlx, the proposed rule change does not apply to limit orders, including marketable limit orders, because such orders are executed manually and, therefore, already have an opportunity for price improvement.

Uchimoto, Vice President and General Counsel, Phlx, and Glen Barrentine, Senior Counsel, SEC, on December 9, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

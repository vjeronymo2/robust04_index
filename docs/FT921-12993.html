			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Independent's owner hopes for modest profit NEWSPAPER Publishing, owner of The Independent and the Independent on Sunday, is hoping for a modest profit in the year to September in spite of one of the worst advertising recessions for broadsheet newspapers for decades. Last year NP incurred pre-tax losses of Pounds 10.3m, although this included a Pounds 1.5m provision for redundancy costs. Last September the company completed an Pounds 8.25m refinancing. Now there are growing hopes that a taxable profit of about Pounds 500,000 is possible this year even though there are still few signs of the recession lifting. The first hint of financially better times for The Independent came yesterday at NP's annual meeting when Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, editor and chief executive, said the company had achieved a 'worthwhile' profit in its first quarter. This compares with a loss of Pounds 1m for the same period in 1990. The company's first quarter includes the strong newspaper advertising months of October and November and the second quarter will be much more difficult. 'Moreover, the recession still lies heavily on our readers and on our advertising customers. There is no buoyancy in our markets,' Mr Whittam Smith said. 'Nonetheless we have got ourselves into a position in which we can make progress in difficult trading conditions,' he added. It is clear that the company hopes that the 'progress' will include a year in the black, even if only modestly so.</p>

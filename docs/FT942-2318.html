			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Company News (This Week): Eurotunnel - Other companies Eurotunnel: At 3 o'clock on Wednesday, Eurotunnel's Pounds 858m rights issue will close, and it is going to be a race to the finish for the underwriters. Having started the week with a 77p cushion above the rights issue, the margin had dropped to 23p by Friday evening, as the shares closed at 288p. Today is the last day of trading for the nil paid rights, and this will provide a pointer for the likely take-up of the issue. Any further fall in the price could prove costly to the sub-underwriters.</p>

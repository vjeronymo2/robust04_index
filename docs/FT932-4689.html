			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Paying the price for never saying 'no': Haig Simonian reports on the debt problems facing Italian group Ferruzzi-Montedison FERRUZZI-MONTEDISON, the Italian chemicals, energy and agro-industrial group, which recently reported record losses, is facing the most testing fortnight in its history. It is negotiating the restructuring of its L15,123bn (Dollars 10bn) borrowings, a deal which could involve Italy's first debt for equity swap. Under new rules proposed by the Bank of Italy, the creditor committee of five banks, headed by Mediobanca, may seek to convert some of the loans into shares. Action is urgent to stop Ferruzzi-Montedison buckling under the weight of debt and losses. Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin), the holding company, lost L1,519bn (Pounds 675m) last year, compared with net profits of L115bn in 1991. Montedison, its main operating subsidiary, lost L1,244bn against net profits of L168bn. The Ferruzzi family has promised radical changes. Serafino Ferruzzi, the holding company wholly owned by the family, will let in outside capital, heavily diluting the family shareholders. Ferfin and Montedison will be forced into big disposals. 'Ferruzzi-Montedison's problems are a tale of empire building, based on an inability to turn down acquisitions, irrespective of their effect on debt, and to cut investment, even when cash flow is crumbling,' says one analyst. The group is Italy's second biggest private-sector company, with revenues of L19,900bn last year. It has mushroomed from its origins in farming and commodities trading. When the founder Serafino Ferruzzi died in 1979, leadership passed to the charismatic and domineering Mr Raul Gardini. He led it into chemicals (Montedison), cement (Calcestruzzi), insurance (Fondiaria) and a string of other operations, including a barely profitable national newspaper (Il Messaggero) and a heavily loss-making TV station (Telemontecarlo). The takeovers created an increasingly indebted conglomerate, with too few synergies and too little management talent. The strains were masked by the booming 1980s, but became impossible to hide in a recession. Mr Gardini left in a huff in November 1990 after failing to receive the family's blessing for a buy-out of the government stake in the Enimont chemicals joint venture. Belatedly, the family saw the group must slim. The baton passed to Mr Carlo Sama, a senior executive married to one of Mr Serafino Ferruzzi's daughters. But time was running out. Mergers were out of fashion; potential buyers were harder to find in a recession; earnings had started to dive. Negotiations on the disposal of the Erbamont pharmaceuticals operation, mooted last summer, were strung out for months as Sweden's Procordia haggled over the price. It took a 51 per cent stake two months ago. Such are Montedison's cash needs that the remaining shares, not expected to be sold until 1994 or so, were passed to a bank intermediary to raise funds sooner. A big plastics joint venture with Shell has still not been finalised. The transaction, now possibly nearing completion, involves pooling the two companies' plastics interests, including Montedison's US-based Himont subsidiary. Separately, Ausimont (speciality chemicals) and Calcestruzzi may also be sold. The Erbamont deal will cut group debt by about L1,900bn while the Shell joint venture should shift a further L2,000bn off Ferruzzi-Montedison's books. But so great are the pressures that even Edison, which has invested heavily in new electricity generating capacity, may be on the block. The company reported net profits up 25 per cent to L152bn last year. The disposals will return Ferruzzi-Montedison to its agro-industrial roots, with Eridania-Beghin Say its main business, plus some chemicals activities. Merging Montedison and Ferfin may also be on the cards. Ferruzzi executives claim the disposals will mark the line behind which they will defend the rest of the group. But claims that Fondiaria, Italy's third biggest private-sector insurer, is an integral part of the empire are unconvincing. Fondiaria is controlled jointly by Ferfin and the family of Mr Camillo De Benedetti, who died earlier this year, through the Gaic holding company. Ferruzzi has already started to flex its muscles there. Fondiaria plunged into a L580bn loss last year on the back of misjudged foreign expansion. But Mr Alfonso Scarpa, the managing director who had guided its foreign growth, has now left the company. And soon after, Fondiaria sold its 21 per cent stake in Aachener und Munchener Beteiligungs, Germany's second biggest insurer, for DM985m. Observers are uncertain whether Ferruzzi's exertion of control over Fondiaria, now chaired by Mr Sama, is an attempt at a turn-around or a preliminary to disposal. Last week, analysts welcomed the company's rosy portrait of its long-term future. The shares were briefly buoyed up by that vision and by rumours that Mr Sergio Cragnotti, a former managing director now running his own financial group, might return in some unspecified role. They have since fallen back, and yesterday Ferfin closed below its nominal value. Short-term prospects for Ferruzzi-Montedison remain grim. Although first quarter operating profits rose, chemicals show little sign of improvement. And still the acquisitions continue: Eridania-Beghin Say is bidding for part of the Italian SME foods group now being privatised. Some habits die hard. Fondiaria debt, Page 22</p>

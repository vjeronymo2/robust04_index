Today's plan of the joint flight envisages  geophysical, medical, and biotechnological experiments, and the  transfer of duties to the crew of the fifteenth main expedition.    A cycle of video-filmings and spectrometeric observations of  separate parts of the earth's continents and oceans are being  carried out in keeping with the programme of studies of the  earth's natural resources and the environment.    The new crew, brought to the complex a short while ago, is  carrying out a series of experiments to study in greater detail  the mechanisms of the human organism's adaptation to the  conditions of orbital flight, including by the method of blood  composition.    The biotechnological experiment, started on January 10, is  being continued. Its purpose is to explore the possibility of  obtaining hybrid cells of plants in conditions of  imponderability.    The old crew of the complex is to check during the day the  condition of the board systems of the "Soyuz TM-17" vehicle and  to prepare it for the return voyage to the earth.    Reports received from the cosmonauts and telemetric data  show  that the flight is proceeding normally.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Yuriy Spiridonov, chairman of the </F> Komi Supreme Soviet, by Natalya Koposova; place and date not  given: "Spiridonov to the Center: `We Are Just as Good as You'"]    [Text] Elections are approaching in the Republic of  Komi. Chairmen of the local organs of authority will be elected,  but what attracts special attention in the republic is that its  head will be elected. Today we present Yuriy Spiridonov,  chairman of the Komi Supreme Soviet, a candidate who was  nominated by more than 100 Komi organizations. The leader of the  Komi Republic was heard of for the first time in Russia when the  newly organized Council of the Heads of Republics (SGR) rapidly  began to take on importance in Russian politics. A group was  formed in the SGR--Spiridonov (Komi), Stepanov (Karelia),  Shaymiyev (Tataria), Nikolayev (Yakutia), and Rakhimov  (Bashkiria), which actually has been determining the policy of  the republics with respect to the Center.    [Begin boxed item] No matter which way you turn, you cannot  get a panorama of our 170 degrees of Russian longitudes without  the Republic of Komi. But what do we know about it? Mining  Vorkuta, Polar Inta and strikes, miners' pickets at the White  House in Moscow... More? The capital of the GULAG under Stalin,  where the model of "camp socialism" was tested, at present  belongs to regions whose dominant idea is clearly mining. It is  difficult to judge the whole republic after visiting only  Syktyvkar. The capital city draws another picture, how to  resolve the problem of the Pechora coal basin. Some hotheads are  demanding the closing of unprofitable mines. Perhaps this is  justified from the economic aspect. But it should not be  forgotten that in 1941, when the German troops cut off the  Donets Basin, it was Vorkuta coal that saved the country. A new  coat of arms--a one-headed eagle--will soon appear in the  Republic of Komi. Will the election results justify this symbol?    [End boxed item]    Every SGR meeting with the president caused ironic comments  behind the scenes: How many and what kind of quotas and licenses  were haggled for one or another political decision... It would  be ridiculous to deny this: The right of the "to dispense  favors" remains with the center as before. However, the SGR  tried to change this tradition. After signing the Federative  Treaty, Spiridonov and his colleagues consistently tried to get  a redistribution of powers from the Center. Today the leader of  Komi thinks that it is quite realistic to get away from the  system of coaxing subsidies.    [Spiridonov] I want never to have to plead with Moscow, and  we are ready to do this, if the president of the Russian  Federation removes his structures... Give us equal conditions of  price formation. And do not hinder the sale of products. And the  taxes that the state does not collect in full now, we will bring  on a silver platter. Then it will be able to resolve questions  of the defense industry, the military, and pensioners. [end  Spiridonov]    The president has now approved a schedule of signing of  treaties between the federal center and the components of the  Russian Federation. Spiridonov, one of the leaders of the  regional Russian elite, believes that from an economic aspect  the krays and oblasts should have equal opportunities with the  republics. Today's crisis is difficult for everyone, but Komi's  situation can be called extremely difficult. Therefore,  Spiridonov consistently lobbies in the Federation Council for  laws that promote a change in the situation in the republic.    [Spiridonov] The main thing for us is to adopt a law on the  Northern Territories that regulate questions of benefits and  compensation for people living in the rayons of the Far North  and those comparable to it. Moreover, a state program for the  development of the northern regions is absolutely necessary  today. After all, more than 90 percent of all of the mineral-raw  material potential of Russia is concentrated in them. [end  Spiridonov]    Spiridonov's style of work was noticed in the Center a long  time ago. And for those in the know, Viktor Chernomyrdin's  decision to draw the leader of the republic into the Government  of the Russian Federation for the position of first deputy in  charge of fuel and energy questions was not a big surprise.    However, Spiridonov preferred to remain in Komi...  <H5>  Sources </H5>   It is not easy to understand Yuriy Alekseyevich's strong  attachment to this severe land. It seems that he was not even  born here, but in faraway Omsk Oblast. He graduated from an  institute in Sverdlovsk, and later worked at the Gornyy mine in  Magadan Oblast. He went through the school of life there,  starting out as a foreman. He turned up in Komi in 1964.    [Spiridonov] Every day of work at that time brought  happiness. Just the construction of the hot water system to  Bagan was worth a lot. Instead of a hundred meters, we began to  lay a kilometer to a kilometer and a half in a day. Now--it is  not the same. Some kind of dissatisfaction always remains. [end  Spiridonov]    Veterans of Usinsk, people who worked with him, call him  "Pop" to this day. He "captured" the people, it is said, with  trustworthiness. If he called for "plowing," then he was the  first to set an example. But the main thing is that Spiridonov  succeeded in inspiring trust in people, in changing attitudes  toward the land, to which either romantics after a  "will-o'-the-wisp" were drawn, or, just the opposite,  self-servers who were after quick and easy money. It is  recounted that when he received the assignment to Usinsk, there  were not many enthusiasts there. People, who were housed in  barracks, had "started to become brutalized." They were sick of  the disorder. They came to earn a little money--and go back. At  that time in 1981, all of Usinsk's wells produced an increase in  production of 20,000 tonnes of oil annually. Spiridonov raised  this to 70,000 in two years. The more oil, the more income there  was in the city budget. They started to build more. People were  housed not in communal accommodations but in separate  apartments. And people stopped scattering.    Immediately after this, Spiridonov was appointed to the Komi  Oblast CPSU Party Committee as second secretary. When Spiridonov  was elected first secretary, elections were going on in the  country to a renewed and restructured Supreme Soviet of the  USSR. He was nominated as a candidate, and his rivals were  Father Gleb Yakunin and ARGUMENTY I FAKTY Editor in Chief  Starkov...    Spiridonov, who did not make an abrupt change from the  communists to the democrats and patriots, then had to render an  account to the voters of Ukhta for the entire CPSU and for all  leaders from Lenin to Brezhnev. It is amusing and sad to  acknowledge this, but witnesses recall that a female cloakroom  attendant, who, attracted by the noise of the crowd,  accidentally ended up in the hall, stuck up for Spiridonov. She  put to shame the denouncers, who were not letting him say a word  clearly.    Spiridonov was elected. Yakunin and Starkov withdrew their  candidacies before the elections.  <H5>  Comrades-in-Arms </H5>   It is the same story today before the elections to the post  of head of the republic. Estimating the situation realistically,  Anatoliy Karakchiyev, the mayor of Syktyvkar, withdrew his own  candidacy and joined a group in support of Spiridonov. After the  affirmation of the head of the city, young and fresh forces were  oriented to Spiridonov. They were confident that changes in the  republic were possible if Spiridonov led the process.    The same opinion is held by Vladimir Torlopov, the first  deputy of Spiridonov's main rival, Prime Minister Vyacheslav  Khudyayev. He believes that without a renewal of the government  and without involving new personnel, it will be impossible to  contain the situation. In the present extreme situation no one  except Spiridonov, Torlopov is convinced, will be able to  execute leadership, or, moreover, to ensure change.    The people in the group supporting Spiridonov are  principally  those who went through the entire election campaign with him.  The reason for this constancy is one and the same--he does not  desert people. In any situation. Valentin Kotelnikov, director  of Syktyvkar's personnel center, recounted the following story.    Masha Trikhanovich, a single woman and secretary of the city  party committee of the Komsomol [All-Union Leninist Communist  Youth League], who almost died in a car accident in 1980, worked  with Spiridonov a long time. The first one to rush to the  hospital at that time was Yuriy Alekseyevich. Dropping his own  affairs, he helped the accident victim--he himself fixed blinds,  repaired a mirror... And although many years have passed, to  this day he supports Masha, who became an invalid.    People's teacher A. Katolikov, director of the Syktyvkar  agricultural boarding school, appearing on the local television  program "Pyramid of Power," probably most accurately defined the  inner substance of the republic's leader: He is good in a purely  human way... Children are attracted to him." Spiridonov often  visits the boarding school. Always with gifts.    Once, as A. Katolikov recounted, a "Farmer" tractor was sent  to him from Holland. And along with it, another one--a small  one, which bore the inscription "To Fedor Spiridonov." "We  wondered a long time who it was for. And then we realized, this  was Spiridonov's grandson...! Two weeks passed, and Yuriy  Alekseyevich drove up, towing this tractor behind him: "You  know, I was told that your lads liked it very much..."  <H5>  Hostage </H5>   It would seem that it was not necessary for him, who still  did not lose any of his human qualities on the road to  authority, to remain in high politics. Especially in this  period, when it is unlikely that anyone will say thank you, and  why take the burden of such an unenviable economy on one's  shoulders? It is simpler to go upward, where he will be taken at  any moment. But it would be a pity for Spiridonov to leave  hundreds of started projects.    [Spiridonov] I cannot drop all of this today... I have  simply  become hostage to all these matters. I know what I must bear.  [end Spiridonov]    This is understood in both the Center and in the republic.  For Moscow, Spiridonov has become almost the last conductor  through whom they can still influence a region that goes on  strike regularly. He is the last guarantor of the future for the  republic and for the miners.    It is understood in the republic that were it not for  Spiridonov, it would take even longer to wait for a real payment  of debts, and the transferred sums could be "idle" to this day.  Yes, Spiridonov will also periodically have to play the role of  "no-nonsense expediter." But, as he himself hopes, temporarily,  as long as the Center continues to fulfill functions that are  uncharacteristic for it.    As for his preelection program, Spiridonov thinks that these  are the priority directions in his strategy:    --reanimation of laws adopted by the Supreme Soviet of Komi:  "On Additional Guarantees for Maternal and Child Protection,"  "On Social Protection of Invalids," and "On Social Protection of  Veterans in the Republic of Komi";    --ensuring financing of the state programs: "Childhood" and  "Health of Women--Planning a Family";    --further development of the fuel-energy and lumber  complexes; the main thing here is to increase the quality of  produced products owing to the creation of a higher  technological processing standard, which will ensure their  competitiveness on the world market;    --establishment of a new mining-metallurgical complex for  mining and processing bauxite, titanium and manages ores,  barite, rock salt, and other minerals;    --establishment of a scientific-production center for  processing preplanned and pre-project materials for the  development of productive forces, an economic estimate, and the  creation of effective technologies for processing raw minerals  without waste;    --preservation of an atmosphere of international peace and  harmony, which is traditional for the Komi region.</p>

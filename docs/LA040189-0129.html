			<p><P> April 1, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GARDEN GROVE LEAGUE;  </P> <P> KENNEDY MAKES AN IMPRESSION ON LA QUINTA WITH 6-0 VICTORY  </P> <P> Kennedy High School scored six runs in the seventh inning Friday to stun host  La Quinta, 6-0, stopping the Aztecs' unbeaten streak at 11 games.  </P> <P> Kennedy (10-3, 2-0) had six hits in the inning, including a two-run homer by  designated hitter Ernie Franco. Pete Montera (5-0) pitched his third shutout of  the season.  </P> <P> It was also the first victory in six games for Kennedy Coach Chris Pasqual  against perennial power La Quinta. La Quinta (11-3-1, 1-1) has dominated play  in the Garden Grove League for most of Coach Dave Demarest's 16 seasons, but it  appears Kennedy might have the talent to unseat La Quinta this season.  </P> <P> "It's a good feeling to beat La Quinta because Dave runs such a good program,"  Pasqual said. "I can remember the first time we played La Quinta four years ago  and lost, 19-3. Our program has come a long way since then."  </P> <P> Montera allowed three hits and struck out 12, including six in a row from the  first to third innings. He mixed off-speed pitches inside with a slider that  broke away.  </P> <P> "I figured if I could keep throwing strikes, our hitters would come around  eventually," said Montera, who allowed only one walk. "I felt good to beat the  No. 1 guys, it was about time."  </P> <P> Montera and La Quinta starter Jon Korzen were locked in a pitching duel for  five innings before Korzen left the game with one out in the sixth after  completing his allotted 70 pitches.  </P> <P> "He had tendinitis in his shoulder, so we put a limit on his pitches," Demarest  said. "I was hoping to get five innings out of him, but he did a good job of  keeping us even until the sixth inning.  </P> <P> "They're a good ballclub. Montera is a fine pitcher and they hit the ball. All  they have to do is start believing in themselves and then they can beat  anybody."  </P> <P> Kennedy made believers out of La Quinta in the seventh. Consecutive singles by  catcher Scott Wood, pinch-hitter Tom Deep and third baseman Paul Ruark off  reliever Corey Giuliano (6-2) broke the tie.  </P> <P> Franco's homer, a long drive over the left-center-field fence, was his third of  the week and ended an afternoon of frustration. He had struck out in his three  previous at-bats.  </P> <P> La Quinta had beaten Kennedy, 7-1, last week in the championship game of  Anaheim Lions tournament, and the Aztecs had them frustrated early Friday by  picking off three runners on first.  </P> <P> In other Garden Grove League games:  </P> <P> Garden Grove 3, Bolsa Grande 2 -- Garden Grove (4-5-1, 1-1) scored three runs  in the bottom of the third, two on a homer by Rob Wursthorn. Shawn Zingali  (1-2) pitched a five-hitter, striking out four. Brian Nuez had a solo home run  for Bolsa Grande (6-5, 0-2).  </P> <P> Pacifica 6, Los Amigos 3 -- Pacifica (2-7, 2-0) scored four unearned runs, as  Los Amigos made five errors at Los Amigos. Bobby Anderson and Kevin Ashworth  each drove in runs for Pacifica. Al Talavera had two RBIs for Los Amigos (4-9,  1-1).  </P> <P> Santiago 8, Rancho Alamitos 2 -- Phil Gonzales (1-1) pitched a six-hitter for  Santiago (4-6-1, 1-1).  </P></p>

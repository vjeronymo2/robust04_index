			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> WEEKENDER;  </P> <P> SUMMER PRO LEAGUE OFFERS THE NEXT BEST THING TO NBA  </P> <P> If your hunger for NBA action didn't end when the Detroit Pistons defeated the  Portland Trailblazers last month, another season of basketball action starts  tonight at Loyola Marymount's Gersten Pavilion.  </P> <P> The Southern California Summer Professional Basketball League, which draws some  of the NBA's top rookies and free agents, opens play for the next four weeks  with a doubleheader at 6 p.m. Most of the players are trying to impress scouts  who are seeking to fill roster openings on National Basketball Assn. or  European teams.  </P> <P> After today's doubleheader, at least four games will be played daily.  </P> <P> In tonight's opening game, the Clippers, minus top draft pick Bo Kimble, will  play the NBA Vets. At 8:15, the NBA Stars, led by the Lakers' Byron Scott, play  the NBA Pros, led by John Williams, the former Crenshaw High standout who plays  for the Washington Bullets.  </P> <P> Saturday's schedule of five games begins at 11:15 a.m. and Sunday's schedule  starts at 10:30 a.m.  </P> <P> Magic Johnson and Michael Cooper of the Lakers, Dominique Wilkins of the  Atlanta Hawks and Isiah Thomas of the Pistons have been known to play a game or  two to stay sharp.  </P> <P> Two teams to keep an eye on are the Lakers, coached by one of their assistant  coaches, and the Canadian Olympians, made up of that country's official entry  in the 1992 Olympic Games.  </P> <P> Information: (213) 202-1258.  </P></p>

			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei down again amid uncertainties and gloom Share prices fluctuated on index-linked activity, and the Nikkei index closed lower for the third consecutive day in thin trading, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei index lost 13.80 to 20,380.78 after fluctuating on selling by arbitrageurs and buying by public funds. The index fell to a low of 20,316.56 in the first few minutes of trading, and hit a high of 20,503.10 in the afternoon. Technical trading dominated activity as most domestic investors remained on the sidelines due to increasing uncertainty over the movement in the yen against the dollar. The dollar fell to a one-month low below the Y97 level, but later recovered to the Y98 line due to buying by the Bank of Japan. Volume totalled 192m shares against 181m. Foreign investors took profits, their holdings having appreciated thanks to the rise in the yen. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 5.66 to 1,631.79 and the Nikkei 300 lost 0.78 to 297.00. Declines led advances by 664 to 290 with 217 unchanged and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 2.56 to 1,325.50. Large capital steels and shipbuilders were actively traded. Nippon Steel, the most active issue of the day, remained unchanged at Y362, while Sumitomo Metal Industries lost Y3 to Y333. High-technology stocks were mostly lower. Toshiba fell Y3 to Y740 and Sharp declined Y10 to Y1,770. Sony, however, gained Y20 to Y5,890 on reports that it is shifting new investments of its audio visual division overseas. Some drug makers, theoretically unaffected by the yen's fluctuation, advanced. Sankyo rose Y20 to Y2,350 and Dainippon Pharmaceutical added Y10 to Y1,130. However, Takeda Chemical Industries fell Y10 to Y1,250 on profit taking. DDI, the telecommunications operator listed on the second section, rose Y6,000 to Y934,000 on bargain hunting. Some traders said the issue, which fell from over Y1m last week, had been previously sold by investors raising money for Thursday's auction of Japan Telecom, another long distance operator. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 69.17 to 22,779.68 in volume of 74.6m shares. The OSE index fell for the fourth straight trading day. Roundup Sentiment was gloomy in most of the region. Bombay remained closed for a holiday. HONG KONG dropped sharply as disappointment over the government land auction results brought late selling. Bearish sentiment towards the dollar also took its toll of the market. The Hang Seng index lost 223.27, or 2.4 per cent to 9,234.06. Turnover was HKDollars 3bn. Mainland Chinese stocks also came under pressure, with the H-share index falling 42.01 to 1,193.10. Properties suffered the most, after the government withdrew a third site scheduled for auction and the first two were sold at the opening bid for prices well below expectations. Sun Hung Kai fell HKDollars 2.25, or 4.3 per cent, to HKDollars 50.50, Henderson Land slid HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 39.70 and Cheung Kong weakened HKDollars 1.10 to HKDollars 35.30. SINGAPORE was characterised by a lack of buying interest on all fronts. The Straits Times Industrial index finished 18.06 lower at 2,302.88, weighed down by a 40 cent fall in both Cycle &amp; Carriage and Fraser &amp; Neave. Investors preferred to focus on Malaysian shares traded over the counter. SEOUL fell victim to aggressive profit-taking as investors took the view that the market's recent rise had been exaggerated. The composite index retreated 11.45 to 951.51, well off its intraday high of 971.12. Samsung Electronics and Kepco, which led the recent rally, fell 1,000 won and 600 won to 112,400 won and 29,800 won respectively. TAIPEI weakened, although late bargain-hunting in electronics issues helped lift prices off session lows. The weighted index lost 40.41 to 6,798.19 but had recovered from a low of 6,740.14. SYDNEY ended lower amid investor concerns about US inflationary pressures. The All Ordinaries index fell 12 to 2,051.6. BHP ended lower in line with the market but News Corp posted a modest rally. News shares remained well bid after its decision to raise the price of its UK 'Sun' newspaper by 10 per cent.</p>

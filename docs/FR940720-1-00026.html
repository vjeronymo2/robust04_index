Where an individual such as an attorney or registered agent is granted access, he or she will regularly review the security requirements for the system as set forth in these regulations and in any additional materials provided by VBA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) VBA may, at any time without notice:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Inspect the computer hardware and software utilized to obtain access and their location;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Review the security practices and training of any individual or organization granted access under these regulations; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Monitor an individual's or organization's access activities.

The individual or organization is no longer entitled to access as a matter of law under the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. &sect;552a, and 38 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;5701 and 7332. Under these circumstances, the individual or organization is not entitled to any hearing or to present any evidence in opposition to the revocation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) An individual or organization granted access privileges to VBA automated claims benefits systems may have such access privileges revoked either to an individual claimant's records or to all claimants' records if the individual or organization:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Violates any of the provisions of &sect;&sect;14.640 through 14.643;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Accesses or attempts to access data for a purpose other than representation of an individual veteran;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Accesses or attempts to access data other than the data specified in these regulations;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Accesses or attempts to access data on a VA beneficiary who is not represented either by the individual who obtains access or by the organization employing the individual who obtains access;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Utilizes unapproved computer hardware or software to obtain or attempt to obtain access to VBA computer systems;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Modifies or attempts to modify data in the VBA computer systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) If VBA is considering revoking an individual's access, and that individual works for an organization, the Regional Office of jurisdiction will notify the organization of the pendency of the action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) After an individual's access privileges are revoked, if the conduct which resulted in revocation was such that it merits reporting to an appropriate governmental licensing organization such as a State bar, the VBA Regional Office of jurisdiction will immediately inform the licensing organization in writing of the fact that the individual's access privileges were revoked and the reasons why.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) The VBA Regional Office of jurisdiction may temporarily suspend access privileges prior to any determination on the merits of the proposed revocation where the Regional Office Director or the Director's designee determines that such immediate suspension is necessary in order to protect the integrity of the system or confidentiality of the data in the system from a reasonably foreseeable compromise. However, in such case, the Regional Office shall offer the individual or organization an opportunity to respond to the charges immediately after the temporary suspension.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;17358 Filed 7&hyph;19&hyph;94; 8:45 am]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 8320&hyph;01&hyph;P  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporters Lo Ping (5012 0393) and Li Tzu-ching </F> (7812 5261 0079)]    [Text] People with breadth of vision at home and abroad  have always held that the National People's Congress [NPC] is  merely a rubber stamp of the CPC, and does not represent popular  will. The CPC does not like to listen to such criticism and has  always denied this, saying that this is Chinese-style socialist  democracy, which is more democratic than Western parliaments.  Is the NPC system democratic, or is it a rubber stamp of the  CPC? Let the Second Session of the Eighth NPC held by the CPC  not long ago answer the question.  <H5>  Qiao Shi Urges Deputies To Hold Deliberations According to </H5> the Agenda Arranged by the Congress    Prior to the convocation of the congress, Qiao Shi summoned  the chiefs of all the delegations, set forth the tasks, urged  them to hold deliberations according to the agenda arranged by  the congress, and told them to not go too far or make unexpected  proposals.    In light of CPC general practice, interim party groups are  established for holding national-level meetings, which form  small groups, branches, and provisional party committees  composed of party-member deputies. On the day before the  opening of the congress, a preparatory meeting of party members  is held and they are requested to carry out the orders from the  top.    The presidium published in the press is merely a form shown  to the public. It is the central group of the congress which  commands, leads, and exercises control over the congress.  Through the interim party committees and basic level party  organizations (branches and groups) of the delegations, the  central group firmly exercises control over operation of the  congress.  <H5>  Motions Deviating From the Congress Agenda </H5>   The central group is most worried about the proposals and  motions presented by the deputies which deviate from the  congress agenda. Prior to the current congress, a number of  bills and proposals deviating from the congress agenda were  submitted. During the session, the deputies again made bills,  proposals, and joint speeches, which deviated from the congress  agenda:  <H5>  Deputies Strongly Demand That Officials Make Public Their </H5> Property    Deputies from Shanghai, Tianjin, Shandong, Jiangsu, and  Zhejiang strongly demanded that members of the CPC Central  Committee's Political Bureau, state councillors, NPC vice  chairmen and CPPCC vice chairmen who are party members, and  ministers of various committees and ministries give an account  of their economic status, as well as the political, economic,  and working conditions of their dependents and relatives so that  they can be placed under NPC supervision and can win popular  trust.    When deputies from the Shandong and Jiangsu delegations  planned to submit such a joint motion to the congress for  examination, the central group and the party committees of some  delegations held that the motion "overstepped the bounds."  <H5>  Qinghai Blames Central Leadership for Damaging Its Own </H5> Reputation    A deputy from Qinghai pointed out that the central  leadership  called for support for the poor provinces to end their  backwardness, but no funds have been allocated and a request for  enjoying the preferential policies similar to the coastal areas  was not even approved. As a result, local leaders and masses  said: The central leadership is saying one thing but doing  another, thus damaging its own reputation.  <H5>  Ningxia Deputies Complain About the New Tax System </H5>   The deputies from Ningxia had a different view on the State  Council's tax reform and revenue-sharing system: To narrow the  gap between regions and assist the development of the backward,  poor, and remote regions, a different tax system should be  formulated in light of the economy, output value, and base  figures of each province, municipality, and autonomous region.  <H5>  Deputies From Beijing and Hebei Say Streamlined Cadres </H5> Incompetent    Deputies from Beijing and Hebei pointed out: Party and  government organs have not taken due action in the work of  streamlining cadres. Some of the streamlined cadres have sought  employment in economic entities, financial organizations, or  large joint venture. When they cannot not make a gain or the  conditions are inferior to their former units, they resume their  former positions and some even get a promotion. Last year, the  number of cadres streamlined was less than 10 percent of the set  target. The motion submitted by the Beijing delegation said:  As streamlining constitutes an important measure of reform, it  should become a regular work and the set target must be met on  schedule.  <H5>  Triads Running Wild in Shanxi </H5>   A Shanxi deputy urged the NPC Standing Committee's survey  team to probe into the activities of triads in Shanxi. The  deputy pointed out: The provincial government and the  procuratorial and judicial organs always try to shift their  responsibility by saying that the "problems are thorny" and  "most of them constitute a problem among the people." The  deputy said: The problem lies in the government leaders. When  the question was raised by the deputy, the delegation party  committee called for seeking unity of thinking and not raising  the issue. But some deputies asked the party committee: What  is the motive behind that?  <H5>  Inner Mongolia Requests the Preferential Policies of a </H5> Special Economic Zone    A deputy from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region submitted  a motion asking the central leadership to ratify Inner  Mongolia's request to enjoy preferential policies similar to the  Hainan Special Economic Zone [SEZ] so that they can open the  door to the Republic of Mongolia and Russia. Some deputies  proposed that leaders of the autonomous region and prefecture  governments should be composed of the local nationals.  <H5>  Hainan Wants To Set Up Red Light Districts </H5>   A Hainan deputy asked whether the government could make  legislation, allowing Haikou and Sanya to set up red light  districts, which would enable the two cities to become more like  a capitalist society, enhance social order, and increase revenue.  <H5>  Shandong Urges Separation of Party Leadership From </H5> Government Administration    A Shandong deputy said: The people's congresses are the  highest organs of state power. But they have actually become  subsidiaries of the party committees and governments. This does  not conform to the PRC Constitution. Party organizations should  not meddle in government work. The functions of the party  should be separated from those of the government and the party  committee secretary and deputy secretaries must not concurrently  take up the offices of government and the people's congress.  <H5>  Hubei Wants To Embody the Authority and Dignity of the </H5> "People's Congress"    A Hubei deputy said: To embody the authority and dignity of  the people's congress, it is necessary to first establish the  status and functions of the people's congress. The functions  and powers of the people's deputies should be defined so that  they are representative. The proportion of nonparty figures and  mass representatives should account for over 35 percent, and  gradually increase to over 55 percent, which can fully represent  the people of all strata. Deputies from Hubei plan to jointly  submit a motion with the Hunan deputies: To fully embody the  authority and representativeness of the people's congress, we  propose that the proportion of nonparty figures and mass  representatives be set at over 35 percent, which will be raised  to over 45 percent at the 14th NPC.  <H5>  Anhui Deputies Want Veto Power and the Right To Remove </H5> Officials    In light of the powers authorized by the constitution on  people's deputies, a deputy from Anhui pointed out that people's  deputies have the right to address the people's congress on  examining and removing incompetent officials and even ministers,  the premier, and the president. The standing committees of the  people's congresses have the right to veto the decisions,  policies, and personnel arrangements of the governments at all  levels. However, the people's congresses at all levels are  actually under the control of the relevant party committees.  <H5>  Deputies From Three Northeast Provinces Demand War </H5> Compensation From Japan    A total of 120 deputies from Liaoning, Jilin, and  Heilongjiang submitted a joint motion: The Japanese authorities  must openly apologize for the aggressive war launched against  China and compensate for the losses incurred on the Chinese  people. It is said that Hubei deputies also submitted a similar  motion, demanding that Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa  apologize to the Chinese people during his visit to China.  <H5>  Qiao Shi's "Three-Point Instruction" </H5>   In the face of these motions, Qiao Shi made a three-point  instruction at a meeting of chiefs of the delegations held on 13  March:    First, the interim party committees and central groups of  all  delegations should offer guidance in light of the main theme of  the NPC and CPPCC sessions and correct the deviations.    Second, regarding practices which exceed the limits during  the session, persuade as much as possible and give full play to  the key role of the central groups.    Third, the main theme should be stressed and unity of  thinking and views should be sought at the party committee and  central group meetings. Measures must be adopted to avoid  unnecessary motions and bills, which might affect the session.    At the meeting, Li Ruihuan said: When someone has gone too  far, you should step out and stress the main theme of the  congress at all times. The party committees and central groups  of all delegations must have their delegation well in hand and  try to stop the bills and motions that overstep the bounds.    Qiao Shi summoned the chiefs of the delegations to a meeting  on 16 March, where he urged them to keep to the main theme at  the final stage of the session and to not let the problems which  deviate from the main course affect the achievements attained at  the session. Qiao Shi emphasized: Full play should be given to  the role of the core of all delegations.    Obviously, the bills and motions submitted by the deputies  to  the congress reflect popular will to a certain extent. It is  the public opinion taken from the lower to the top levels.  Instead of accepting such public opinion, the CPC attacked the  practice and tried by every means to strangle these "unexpected  motions." Can this be interpreted as democracy? Conversely,  they imposed their theme to the congress and to the people at  the basic levels. Is this what they call Chinese-style  socialist democracy?    At the NPC session, Qiao Shi gave a vivid lesson to the  deputies, enabling them to clearly see through the so-called  Chinese-style socialist democracy.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] During a ceremony at List 2000 [not further  specified] headquarters at midday on 1 June, Julio Maria  Sanguinetti, leader of the Batlleist Forum [Colorado Party  faction], and Senator Hugo Batalla, leader of the Party of the  Government by the People, were presented with a document  containing the programmatic bases of an electoral agreement  between both political movements.    Flanked by Hugo Fernandez Faingold and Heber Gatto,  Sanguinetti and Batalla each delivered a short speech on the  agreement's implications to an audience of more than 100 people,  including leaders and experts from both movements. [passage  omitted]    Sanguinetti said: "What nurtures this agreement is a  reflection and an analysis of the country and its future."    He added that it was with this objective in mind that he  started to negotiate with Sen. Hugo Batalla, and stated that he  was confident that talks would be brought to a successful  conclusion in the coming weeks. [passage omitted]</p>

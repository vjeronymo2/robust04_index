			<p><P> January 10, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WILD LIFE OF CEAUSESCU'S DAUGHTER BARED  </P> <P> The high-living daughter of Romania's executed dictator Nicolae Ceausescu had a  long line of lovers, was a seasoned traveler and almost permanently drunk, a  Bucharest newspaper reported today.  </P> <P> Whenever she ran away from home, her mother, Elena, ordered a nationwide search  mobilizing militia and secret police to hunt her down, the independent daily,  Tineretul Liber (Free Youth) said.  </P> <P> Zoia Ceausescu, said to be in her late 30s, was arrested hours before her  parents were executed by an army firing squad on Christmas Day after a military  court found them guilty of genocide.  </P> <P> Zoia and her playboy brother, Nicu, are in detention awaiting trial. No trace  has been found of their adopted brother, Valentin.  </P> <P> Zoia fell in love very easily and her escorts ranged from ministers to barmen,  the paper said.  </P> <P> "When she saw a handsome man she wouldn't let him go until she had hooked him."  </P> <P> Zoia, who, the paper said, had twice undergone treatment at drying-out clinics,  would drink her lovers under the table and would kick them out of her room if  they were later too drunk to respond to her advances.  </P> <P> The newspaper said Zoia was a "nymphomaniac" who courted ex-convicts who were  quickly propelled to top positions in industry if "she considered them to be  good lovers."  </P> <P> But she was easily angered by overbearing Securitate men who would suddenly  find themselves exiled to a job in a remote part of Romania on her say-so.  </P> <P> Her large private apartment near Ceausescu's lavish Bucharest residence, the  Primaverii Palace, contained a massive bar stocked with whiskey, gin and  Cinzano that was regularly replenished.  </P> <P> The article said "the princess" bore all the signs of her high living -- sunken  cheeks, wrinkles and dark rings around the eyes.  </P> <P> Whenever she tired of life in Bucharest, Zoia would give her bodyguards the  slip and run away with one of her boyfriends, the paper said.  </P> <P> Zoia, supposedly head of the mathematics department of a technical institute,  was hardly ever in Bucharest, Tineretul Liber said. She would travel to Paris  or Madrid "not to visit the Louvre or the Prado museum but to enjoy the finer  things of life."  </P></p>

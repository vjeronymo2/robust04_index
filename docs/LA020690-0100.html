			<p><P> February 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> WASHINGTON, D.C.;  </P> <P> ALCOHOL, DRUGS TIED TO TRUCKER FATALITIES  </P> <P> The National Transportation Safety Board, reporting on a study of drinking and  drug use by truck drivers who died in accidents, said that 33% of the drivers  killed within 12 months in eight states were impaired by alcohol or other  drugs.  </P> <P> The board indicated that it will recommend stepped-up testing and a reduced  legal limit on blood-alcohol content -- perhaps 0.01% -- for commercial  haulers. The current limit is 0.04%, and a driver can be ordered off the road  for 24 hours for any alcohol use. The board emphasized that its findings do not  mean that every third truck driver on the road is impaired, since the study  used only data from post-mortem tests.  </P></p>

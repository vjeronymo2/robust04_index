			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> COUNCILMAN ISSUES APOLOGY FOR ARREST  </P> <P> Ventura City Councilman James Monahan on Thursday apologized "if I have caused  any embarrassment to the city or my constituents," in his first public  statement since he was arrested early Wednesday for allegedly driving under the  influence of alcohol.  </P> <P> "Unfortunately, councilmen are people too, and they make mistakes," Monahan  said.  </P> <P> Monahan was arrested at 1:28 a.m. Wednesday while headed south on the Ventura  Freeway near South Rose Avenue after a California Highway Patrol officer  noticed that the councilman's car was "swerving back and forth between the lane  and the right shoulder," CHP spokesman Brian DeMattia said.  </P> <P> Monahan said the incident took place while he was driving toward a home he owns  in Camarillo after working at his office and eating dinner at Carrow's  restaurant on California Street.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, Monahan had spent the day at a League of California Cities  conference in Anaheim, he said.  </P> <P> Upon returning to Ventura that evening, he learned that a close friend had died  and headed toward The King and I restaurant on East Main Street in Ventura to  meet with and console the widow and her relatives, Monahan said.  </P> <P> At the restaurant, he ordered one vodka and soda and a second drink was sent to  him by a friend, he said. About 9:30 p.m., he left the restaurant and went to  work at his Ventura office. After stopping at the Carrow's restaurant for a  late meal and two cups of coffee, he got on the freeway and headed home,  Monahan said.  </P> <P> Monahan said a preliminary alcohol level test taken at the scene showed he was  0.01% above the state's legal limit for drivers of 0.08%. DeMattia confirmed  that a preliminary breath test was conducted, but said he did not know the  results.  </P> <P> DeMattia said that a urine test was also conducted and that results of that  test -- which has far more legal weight than the preliminary test -- will be  available in two weeks.  </P> <P> Monahan said he made an error of judgment in assessing his condition before  deciding to drive and added that a series of unforeseen circumstances  contributed to his arrest.  </P> <P> First, he said, he would have never been drinking had it not been for the news  of his friend passing away. "It was a shock to me," Monahan said. Also, Monahan  said, he was driving his newly acquired 1984 Cadillac, which has a much tighter  steering system than the car he previously owned.  </P> <P> His unfamiliarity with the vehicle, Monahan said, made it more difficult for  him to keep it in a straight line. "It just feels like a different car," he  said.  </P> <P> Finally, when he noticed the patrol car behind him, Monahan reached down to  readjust his seat belt and at that moment his car swerved, he said.  </P> <P> "I feel embarrassed about the whole thing," he said. "I don't drink and drive.  I just misjudged the situation. I didn't think there was so much alcohol in my  system." SANTIAGO O'DONNELL  </P></p>

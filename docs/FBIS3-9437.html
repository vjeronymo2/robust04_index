			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Zhelyu Zhelev has written to UN General  Secretary Butrus Butrus-Ghali pointing out that the Balkan  countries are burdened by their past, and that any military  intervention by a Balkan country in Bosnia-Herzegovina, even as  part of the Blue Helmet forces and even when prompted by the  noblest of motives, could evoke old suspicions and animosity.    While the president expresses understanding for the growing  need to increase the number of Blue Helmets, without which the  agreements that have been reached could not be implemented, he  points out that there is an even greater risk if soldiers from  any Balkan country participate in the Blue Helmets.    President Zhelev expresses confidence that the UN general  secretary is aware of this danger and will continue his efforts  to seek an appropriate solution on the part of the world  organization.    The Bulgarian president recalls that since the beginning of  the crisis Bulgaria has repeatedly declared that it will not  take advantage of the situation and will not participate in any  military way in the events in former Yugoslavia. Bulgaria also  appealed to the other neighboring Balkan states to do the same.    The president also recalls the strict observance of the UN  embargo against Serbia and Montenegro, and stresses that,  despite its great losses and difficulties, Bulgaria will  continue to follow this policy.</p>

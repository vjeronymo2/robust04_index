			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar rallies in late trading The dollar staged a late rally on the foreign exchange markets yesterday, as flows out of the D-Mark raised expectations of a further strengthening of the US currency, writes Simon London. The dollar lost some ground overnight in Far Eastern trading although dealers reported good two-way business, suggesting that sentiment remained evenly split between buyers and sellers. Sellers had the edge in Japan, however. From a close of DM1.5780 and Y127.05 in New York, the US currency declined to DM1.5688 and Y126.05 by the close in Tokyo. The Japanese currency was initially undermined by the emergence of another financial scandal involving the political establishment. Against this, the yen was supported by comments from Mr Yasushi Meino, Bank of Japan govenor, which were taken to rule out another early cut in the discount rate. In European trading the cautious tone continued, with the dollar trading in a narrow range either side of DM1.57 for most of the morning session. US retail sales figures for December, showing a decline of 0.4 per cent, at the more gloomy end of expectations, did nothing to assist the US currency. However, a late surge took the US currency to DM1.5905 by the close, against DM1.5725 on Monday, with the rally continuing towards DM1.60 in New York. Dealers pointed to the decision by the German metal workers union to ballot members on strike action in pursuit of a 10 per cent pay claim. As dealers switched out of the D-Mark, the US currency was the main beneficiary. The dollar closed against the yen at Y126.80, the same as Monday's level, underlining that the majority of switching came from holders of D-Marks. Earlier, the Bank of Spain surprised most observers by moving to increase 10-day interest rates at its regular money market tender. The bank increased rates from 12.5 per cent to 12.65 per cent, enough to lift the peseta marginally within the European exchange rate mechanism. The peseta improved to Pta63.65, from Pta63.73, against the D-Mark, with similar modest gains against most other European currencies. The Spanish currency is already the strongest with in the ERM and its marginal appreciation lifted the effective floor for sterling, the weakest currency in the system. The floor rose from DM2.8320 to DM2.8350 during the morning session. Sterling responded by rising to DM2.8380, maintaining the slim margin above the floor which has been held since the middle of last week. However, the weakness of the D-Mark during late afternoon took some of the pressure off sterling and by the close the UK currency had improved to DM2.85, from DM2.8350 on Monday. This was the peak for the day and in New York trading sterling had fallen back to DM2.8430, still comfortably above its ERM floor.</p>

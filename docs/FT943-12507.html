			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Arts (Openings): Royal Albert Hall Nobody would be more delighted than Ethel Smyth at the high profile women composers have been enjoying this year. Jailed as a suffragette and a larger-than-life personality (she once went golfing in her pyjamas in the Sudanese desert) Ethel Smyth defied convention and fought to achieve her musical ambitions.

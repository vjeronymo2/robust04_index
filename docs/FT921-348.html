			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Arts: Leiferkus/Warsaw Philharmonic - Music in London Sergey Leiferkus, an outstanding artist on the concert platform no less than on the operatic stage, seems in peak form just now. On Thursday at the Purcell Room, in the latest instalment of the hall's current song-recital series, he gave a spellbinding demonstration of his powers. He imposes a recitalist's cultivated authority on every song; the bounds of the medium are adhered to with faultless skill and taste, with complete avoidance of the overblown rhetoric that inevitably betrays an opera-baritone out of his element. Yet into the current of his performances the listener is drawn by an irresistible pull of dramatic magnetism. By means of physical and vocal demeanour exactly judged and allied, Leiferkus compels attention in a way given to very few of his contemporaries. This was particularly evident in Thursday's concert. The programme mixed lesser-known Borodin, Dargomyzhsky, Glinka and Kabalevsky songs, with only a few Tchaikovsky and Mussorgsky favourites as encores; the hall, even with its new coloured prints and potted palms, remains a miserable place for song recitals. The dangers of worthy dullness were all too apparent. Instead, one hung on every note and word. Simply as an example of a mastersinger's art, the occasion was continually remarkable - the dynamic range wide, the phrase-shaping supple, the attack sharp-pointed, a dark brilliance in the top register giving a special punch to climaxes. The second-half selection of seven Kabalevsky settings (in Russian translation) of Shakespeare sonnets seemed in themselves musically mild, Rakhmaninov-and-water stuff; yet so broad and subtly varied were the performances (in which the pianist, Semyon Skigin, played a vividly communicative part in spite of occasional finger-flusters), that a truly Shakespearean dimension was suggested after all. * To the same hall on Tuesday the Hungarian clarinettist Kalman Berkes brought a no less compelling artistic magnetism. He is the leading light of the Budapest Wind Ensemble, but here, with the pianist Piers Lane in excellent form, he showed himself a soloist of virtuoso technique and bold personality. In Schumann, Saint-Saens and Rossini, the delivery was light-years removed from the well-groomed, low-key musicianship characteristic of British clarinet-players: Mr Berkes made a lean sound, sometimes fiercely (but never unpleasantly) sharp-edged, and cut his phrases with piquant wit. He shared the recital, and Mr Lane's piano-partnership, with Ani Schnarch, a young Romanian violinist with a thrillingly uninhibited approach to Bartok's First Violin Rhapsody and Second Sonata: pungent, fiery, securely controlled. ***** The Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra and its music director of 15 years standing, Kazimierz Kord, paid a visit to Barbican Hall on Thursday night, and the first of their three items - the Polish one - was much their best performance. Lutoslawski's Trauermusik for string orchestra of 1958, four concise movements in a continuous mourning sequence, leans heavily on Bartok and to my ears has a Brittenish feel also, but is clearly moving towards the more stringent dissonances and the sonorous freedoms of Lutoslawski's mature voice, and in this intent, sharply focused account came over as a work of masterful musicianship. Its sombre tone-colours - greys, blacks, dark browns - promised a satisfying contrast to Ravel's G major piano concerto immediately following; but the firework brilliance associated with this music was not forthcoming. Ewa Poblocka was a soloist of almost spinsterish reluctance and reserve. Her delicacy and gentleness of approach readily became deadness and gentility; she lingered so long over the slow stretches of the Allegro first movement that the real slow movement had little to offer; and she played the latter's long opening solo with a disarmingly white and lifeless elegance. Of the concerto's sauciness, blowsiness and jazzy fun we heard next to nothing, whether from soloist or orchestra. The brass department had its problems in the first movement, but one would not have minded fluffs if there had otherwise been flair. In Strauss's great orchestral showpiece of a tone poem Ein Heldenleben the lack of this quality, of vibrant individual stylishness from the section-leaders and a proud collective virtuosity, was fatal. Ewa Marczyk's violin obbligato, it is true, was perfectly decent, but scant instrumental panache was available elsewhere; while the immensely sustained climactic tutti of Part 4 was stodgy and indifferent (the hall's acoustics only partly to blame). The performance needed a far greater variety and far higher definition of colour. Instead of dazzling, it sounded routine, and a routine showpiece makes no sense at all.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 28 (YONHAP) -- The business climate  showed signs of recovery in the first quarter with production,  investment, consumption and employment generally increasing, the  National Statistical Office said Thursday.    Industrial production rose by 10.2 percent in January-March  from the same period last year, spurred by brisk business in the  automobile, machinery, video, audio, communications, and  beverage and food sectors. This marked the first increase since  the last quarter of 1991, according to the office.    Light-industry production inched up 1.2 percent in the first  three months over a year earlier after undergoing a continuous  fall since the second quarter of 1992, while the heavy and  chemical industries posted a 13.7-percent rise in output. The  operating rate of the manufacturing industry reached as high as  82.4 percent between January and March.    Wholesale and retail sales increased 7.1 percent in the  first  quarter over the same quarter last year, with consumer goods  sales in the domestic market rising 6.6 percent during the  period. Orders for machinery except ships rose 32.0 percent, and  authorized machinery imports soared 51.6 percent during the  January-March period over a year ago, showing domestic  businesses' brisk investment.    The population over age 15 increased 568,000 from a year ago  in the cited period to 32,785,000, while the number of  economically active people who are employed or willing to be  employed rose 674,000 to 20,042,000. The figure shows that more  people are seeking jobs in line with the business recovery,  according to the office. The number of employed stood at  19,431,000 in March, up 673,000 from the same month last year.  The jobless figure reached 611,000 in the same month, up 1,000  from a year ago, for an unemployment rate of 3.0 percent.    Those employed in the agricultural, forestry and fisheries  industry fell 255,000 from March last year to 2,499,000 last  month, while workers in the mining and manufacturing industries  increased 100,000 to 4,701,000. Of workers in the mining and  manufacturing industries, those in the manufacturing sector --  which had been falling since September 1991 -- increased to  4,660,000 in March, up 121,000 from a year ago.    The number rose by 53,000 in January this year over last  year, by 71,000 in February and 121,000 in March, showing that  manufacturing is enjoying a business upturn this year.    The coincidence indicator showing the current state of the  economy was a relatively low 0.4 percent in March, but the  leading economic indicators stood at 1.0 percent, predicting a  further business boom.    Cho Hui-kap, director general of the Statistical Survey  Bureau, said, "considering the various business indicators, I  judge that the brisk business is likely to continue."</p>

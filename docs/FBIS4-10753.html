			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jose Marcano from "The News" program] </F>   [Text] The Venezuelan Congress has approved the Special  Powers Law granting special powers to the president to decree  economic and financial measures. The law was approved in the  same form passed by the Chamber of Deputies, despite dissenting  votes by Democratic Action.    Article 1 includes a luxury consumption and wholesale tax  and  repeals the value-added tax. It reforms the income tax law and  the basic tax code and includes a tax on bank account debits.  Article 5 reforms the Stamp Tax Law, and Article 6 extends the  deadline set in Article 22 of the Basic Budget Law for the  executive branch to submit the draft budget to Congress each  year. Article 7 establishes norms regulating the concession of  national public projects and services.    [Begin recording] [National Convergence Senator Bernardo  Celli] We are remembering that people are an important factor in  all social processes. The current law is a combination of  something economic and something social.    [Radical Cause Deputy Alberto Muller Rojas] Congress must  maintain control over certain legal instruments that have the  potential to seriously and adversely affect Venezuelan citizen.    [AD Senator William Davila Barrio] We are opposed because we  are talking about a matter that will have a deep impact on the  state as well as society. [end recording]    After the Special Powers Law is enacted and published in the  official gazette, the president of the Republic has 30 days to  implement all the measures contained in the law. That means the  special powers will only be granted to the president for 30 days.</p>

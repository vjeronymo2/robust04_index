			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Appointments: Moving up a gear Motor trade executive Richard Barber has received his reward for turning round Dovercourt Motor Company, part of Lonrho's many-sided motor activities which include the import and distribution of Volkswagens and Audis in the UK. Barber, who turned Dovercourt from a heavy loss-maker into an earner of Pounds 250,000 profits last year - after just 24 months of his ministrations as managing director - has been made chief executive of Dutton Forshaw, Dovercourt's immediate parent. A 16-year veteran of motor retailing, Barber is aiming to bring to other dealer outlets in the multi-franchise Dutton Forshaw group some of the much increased emphasis on customer satisfaction which turned Dovercourt's Volkswagen/Audi outlet in St John's Wood, London, into the group's flagship dealer and sharply boosted sales at the three other London dealerships. With the Volkswagen group planning to take over from Lonrho the import/distribution of Volkswagens and Audis after the current import agreement expires at the end of next year, Barber's responsibilities are also likely to include looking at wider business opportunities for Dutton. Barber's place at Dovercourt is being taken by Chris Hayden (left), who until now has managed Dovercourt's Battersea dealership. Meanwhile, far to the north, Alexanders Holdings, the biggest Ford main dealer in Scotland, has appointed former Ford UK managing director Roger Humm as executive vice-chairman. Alexanders, still investing heavily in expanding and upgrading a number of outlets despite profits more than halving last year, says Humm is only the first of a number of new directors it expects to appoint this year. The urbane Humm, 54, astonished the UK motor industry world when he resigned the Ford managing directorship abruptly in October 1990. Although his resignation did not formally take effect until the end of that year, Ford announced that he had taken leave of absence with immediate effect.</p>

ITAR-TASS has learned today from military sources that a  small gang of Tajik mojaheeds attempted on Thursday to break  through the positions of Russian border guards, deployed on the  Pyanj sector of the border, heading for Shartuz. However, they  were stopped by Russian border guards and men from one of the  battalions of the CIS peacekeeping force in Tajikistan and  forced back into Afghanistan.    Futile also were the attempts of two small groups of Tajik  opposition fighters to illegally cross into Tajikistan through  the zone controlled by men of the 12th Russian border post.    According to the same source, Tajik mojaheeds, entrenched in  several border provinces of the Islamic state of Afghanistan,  have staged several more minor armed provocations since the  beginning of January on sectors guarded by the Pyanj and  Moskovskiy borderguard detachments. Two violators of the border  were killed. There were no casualities among Russian servicemen.</p>

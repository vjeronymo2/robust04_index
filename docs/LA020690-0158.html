			<p><P> February 6, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> HOOKER'S PENTHOUSE PAY SKIMPY  </P> <P> Debra Murphree, the former prostitute whose liaison with preacher Jimmy  Swaggart rocked an evangelical empire, has signed away three-quarters of the  $210,000 that Penthouse paid for her story.  </P> <P> Murphree will receive about $54,000 for the article published in July, 1988,  said Louis H. Schultz, her attorney.  </P> <P> Agents, attorneys and the Internal Revenue Service will get the rest.  </P> <P> "She's happy. I talked with her on the telephone," Schultz said Monday.  </P> <P> Agents and the IRS had claimed they were owed $428,000 by Murphree, who claimed  that the Baton Rouge-based TV evangelist was a regular customer in 1987.  </P> <P> However, Schultz said their figures were based on inflated estimates of the  amount Penthouse owed for the article and a promotional tour and -- in the IRS'  $217,000 claim -- for income from prostitution.  </P> <P> Murphree told Penthouse that Swaggart paid her $20 a visit to strike prurient  poses and perform sexual acts.  </P> <P> Swaggart tearfully confessed to an unspecified "moral failure" and was  subsequently defrocked by the Assemblies of God.  </P></p>

			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Sport: Courage on the high seas - Sailing CAROL Randall remembers the time and the place precisely. It was 7.55 on the evening of March 5 when the Southern Ocean shattered her right knee. The yacht Heath Insured was half way between Hobart and Cape Town (the nearest land being Antarctica) and Carol was helming the 38-tonne boat through the worst storm the British Steel round the world race had yet encountered. A wave as tall as a three-storey house slewed the yacht around. The wheel span uncontrollably, taking Carol's 9st weight down on to the leg she was bracing herself against. The twisting motion tore two ligaments apart. 'It was absolute, instant agony. I felt like my knee had exploded. The good point was that I hadn't heard anything crack,' recalled Carol, 33, as she hobbled across the Cape Town waterfront on crutches. It was the kind of sports injury found on pitches across the world every weekend. Serious but routine. However, there was no stretcher and hospital bed for Carol. Fellow crew members carried her below for an initial examination. Since the temperature on deck was only just above freezing, with about another minus ten degrees of wind chill, the patient was wearing three layers of foul-weather gear plus thermal long johns. Carol's knee was strapped and she was given strong pain-killers before being lifted into her bunk. Every time Heath Insured slid down the face of gigantic wave, gravity tried to 'torpedo' the patient down the bunk and crunch the injured leg. the only answer was to tie Carol into the bunk. Meanwhile, the weather was deteriorating. The wind had reached Storm Force 11, equal to the 80mph speeds that changed the British landscape in the 1987 hurricane. 'Lying in that bunk was the most frightened I've ever been,' said Carol. Her job before leaving Britain on the Challenge was editing the Harborough Mail, a weekly newspaper in Leicestershire. Until four years ago she had never been on any sort of yacht. 'Down below all you hear is the shrieking wind and the blocks crashing down on the decks. I felt a real failure, desperately isolated and very sad.' Conditions were about as miserable as they could be for someone unable to move without help. When Carol needed to visit the heads (shipspeak for toilet) a colleague had to carry her piggyback down the the central companionway over mounds of wet sails, as the yacht pitched around like the scariest ride at a Florida theme park. Stuart Smith-Warren, who works at a south Wales steel plant in 'real' life, sails in the Bristol Channel for a hobby and is mate aboard Heath Insured. 'The conditions in that storm were unbelievable,' says Smith-Warren. 'The only time you could see anything was on the crest of a wave and then it was just mountain peaks, capped with white, in every direction. 'When we wentdown into a trough and climbed the next wave face we sometimes had green water as high as the first spreaders, 25ft up the mast.' A man who has poured molten steel for a living over the past 30 years is not disposed to exaggeration. It sounds like a test of survival but the British Steel challenge is first and foremost a race. On the day of Carol's accident Heath Insured had 2,274 miles remaining to Cape Town (the end of the third leg) and seven competing yachts within 65 miles of her. 'Once you can't help push the boat, gain those extra miles, you begin to feel excluded and useless,' added Carol, who says she signed up for the Challenge to confront her own fears and learn how to cope with them. 'I always went into this thing for the sheer hell of the adventure. It could have been Everest or diving. Sailing wasn't an essential part of it for me. I suppose it's a bit like National Service used to be,' she said. Chay Blyth, the racing yachtsman who devised and runs the British Steel challenge, is of course an ex-paratrooper. However, the extraordinary thing is that he has been overwhelmed with 'squaddies' eager to pay Pounds 15,000 for a season of physical hardship and adrenalin. 'In the middle of all that Southern Ocean stuff, I knew why I had paid my Pounds 15,000 to Chay to come on this race, said Arthur Haynes,' a Heath crew-member formerly in the computer business. 'It was so rough, it was so cold, we were so far from every other human being. It was a turning point for me.' Cape Town will prove a turning point for many of the 130 crew volunteers. An impossible dream that began three years ago will end in about eight weeks as they sail up Southampton Water with the hooters and fire hydrants blasting. Many have families and jobs to go back to - however reluctantly. Others are more tied to the yachts and their fellow crews than anything else. 'I think the ones who will cope best are the older men with senior jobs or their own businesses,' thought Pete Goss, skipper of Hofbrau Lager and a former marine who had the job of training crew volunteers before they joined their specific yachts. 'This will be an achievement, they'll file it away and go on to the next deal. 'It won't be easy for people who have to go back to a fairly mundane job and the Tube to work every day, to hack it.' Aboard another yacht Nuclear Electric, it is hard to find a single individual, contentedly planning a resumption of normal life. One is planning to live in Nepal, another to go yacht delivering. Mike Golding, skipper of Group 4 and a Berkshire fire officer by profession, is possessed by the desire to win this extraordinary race - he gives the crew Pocket Thoughts, such as 'Sleep for Victory'. Yet he will go back to his fire station. 'Ultimately you have to earn your daily bread,' he says phlegmatically. Chay Blyth is matter-of-fact about the genie he has let out of the bottle. 'Most of them will go back to the office,' he said. 'They're professional about what they do. They're not adventurers and drifters. So they'll go back  -with a kitbag full of memories.'</p>

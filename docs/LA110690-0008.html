			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A.  </P> <P> It didn't start out as a big night for Chaminade High place kicker Amy Cook.  </P> <P> She had a field goal attempt blocked in the first half. "We didn't block for  her very well," said coach Richard Lawson.  </P> <P> But things picked up. At halftime, the 5-foot-6-inch senior changed into a gown  and was crowned homecoming queen of the San Fernando Valley school.  </P> <P> Then Cook changed back into her other outfit and kicked a point after  touchdown, her seventh this year.  </P> <P> Public address announcer Alan Mitchell noted: "That may have been the first  extra point by a homecoming queen."  </P> <P> The West L.A. Veloway was displayed -- complete with artist's conception -- in  a recent USA Today bicycling feature, which said that construction on the  pathway for commuting peddlers "could begin next year."  </P> <P> "It's news to us," said a spokesman for Supervisor Ed Edelman, a member of the  County Transportation Commission.  </P> <P> Urban planner Ryan Snyder, the Veloway's chief advocate, says 1993 is a more  realistic goal -- environmental impact statements haven't even been submitted  yet. But a crucial factor in this budget-strapped era is that at least $6  million must be found to finance the 2.5-mile route.  </P> <P> The Southland has been without a veloway since 1900, when 600 bicyclists  inaugurated the Dobbins Elevated Cycleway. Originally planned as a  Pasadena-L.A. route, it was abandoned a few months later after about a mile had  been completed. Before the cycleway's demise, it was also tested by a Stanley  Steamer, which hit a stupefying speed of 25 m.p.h. That evidently gave  elevated-road planners another idea.  </P> <P> The term-limitation measures on the ballot inspired Val Rodriguez of Signal  Hill to send us a recent vacation photo he took of Throw-the-Rascals-Out-Street  in Ciudad Obregon, Mexico. No Reeleccion was a slogan of the Mexican  Revolution, referring to crooked elections of the regime of dictator Porfirio  Diaz.  </P> <P> An anti-growth group in San Diego, which is opposing two measures on that  area's ballot, goes by the acronym of PLAN. That's short for Prevent Los  Angelization Now.  </P> <P> May they take a long ride on a short veloway.  </P> <P> </P> <P> miscelLAny:  </P> <P> Bubble Boutique in Hollywood claims to be the only shop devoted exclusively to  soap opera memorabilia, including trading cards that list actors' height, hair  and eye color, and personal information, such as "Santa Barbara" star Robin  Mattson's allergy to bee stings.  </P></p>

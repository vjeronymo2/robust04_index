			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Most land bordering the river where the species currently exists is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> owned by the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District, which is a quasi-public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency of the State of New Mexico. Other landowners include six Native  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> American Pueblos, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, the Service, the U.S. Bureau  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Land Management, New Mexico State Parks, New Mexico Department of Game and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fish, New Mexico State Lands Department, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Corps).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Water flow in the middle Rio Grande is controlled by the Rio Grande  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Compact Commission. Established in 1929 for the purpose of permanently and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equitably apportioning the flows of the Rio Grande, the Commission is composed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a Federal chairperson appointed by the President of the United States and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> three voting members_a representative designated by the Texas Governor and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the State Engineers of New Mexico and Colorado. The Commission meets annually  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to review compliance with the compact over the preceding year, to hear reports  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from Federal water management agencies, and to consider water management  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decisions that have interstate implications. Federal agencies that also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine timing and amount of flow in the river include the International  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Boundary and Water Commission, the Bureau of Reclamation, and the Corps.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Previous Service Actions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Rio Grande silvery minnow was listed on the Service's Animal Notice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Review (56 FR 58804; November 21, 1991) as a category 1 species. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> category 1 species is one for which the Service has on file substantial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information on biological vulnerability and threat(s) to support a proposal to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> list it as an endangered or threatened species. A proposed rule to list the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rio Grande silvery minnow as endangered with critical habitat was published in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on March 1, 1993 (58 FR 11821).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Comments and Recommendations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the March 1, 1993, proposed rule and associated notifications, all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interested parties were requested to submit factual reports or information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that might contribute to the development of a final rule. The comment period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> originally scheduled to close on April 30, 1993, was extended until August 25,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1993, (58 FR 19220; April 13, 1993) to conduct public hearings and allow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submission of additional comments. Appropriate Tribal governments, State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies, county governments, Federal agencies, scientific organizations, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other interested parties were contacted and requested to comment. Newspaper  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notices inviting public comment were published in New Mexico in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Albuquerque Journal on May 2, 1993; Las Cruces Sun News on April 30, 1993;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Socorro Defensor Chieftain on April 28, 1993; Santa Fe New Mexican on April  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 20, 1993; and in Texas in the El Paso Times on March 20, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of anticipated widespread public interest, the Service held two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public hearings that were announced in an April 13, 1993,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice. Interested parties were contacted and notified of the hearings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thirty-seven people attended the hearing in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and 58  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attended the hearing in Socorro, New Mexico. Oral or written comments were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received from 25 parties at the hearings; none directly supported the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> listing. Transcripts of these hearings are available for inspection (see  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). Briefing sessions were also held for tribal leaders on May 18,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1993, in Albuquerque, New Mexico; and for a number of northern pueblos at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Santo Domingo Pueblo, New Mexico, on September 9, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A total of 40 written comments were received at the Service's Ecological  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Services State Office in Albuquerque, New Mexico: 13 supported the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> listing; 14 opposed the proposed listing; and 13 commented on information in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed rule but expressed neither support nor opposition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Oral or written comments were received from 7 Federal and 5 state  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies, 14 local officials, and 36 private organizations, companies, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individuals. Written comments and oral statements presented at the public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hearings and received during the comment periods are covered in the following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> summary. Comments of a similar nature or point are grouped into a number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general issues. These issues, and the Service's response to each, are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 1:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service has come to the conclusion that only instream flow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will assure the species' existence. Will the Service propose a program for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the purchase of water rights in order to provide water for the species?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service has not reached this conclusion. Possible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instream flow requirements of the species are among several factors that need  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be considered in the recovery planning process. If, during the recovery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> planning process, the Service determines that the purchase of water rights  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will enhance recovery of the species, the Service would explore with other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State and Federal entities the possible purchase of water rights from willing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sellers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 2:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The United States, under the terms of the Convention of 1906,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has the obligation to deliver 60,000 acre-feet of water annually to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Republic of Mexico. The U.S. International Boundary and Water Commission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (IBWC) is responsible for ensuring that the U.S. government meets those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obligations. The IBWC is concerned that the listing may interfere with their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ability to meet these treaty requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service recognizes the treaty obligation of the United  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States to provide to the Republic of Mexico 60,000 acre-feet of water annually  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the Rio Grande. Measures taken to protect and recover the Rio Grande  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> silvery minnow will take into consideration this treaty obligation and IBWC's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ability to meet treaty requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 3:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Completion of the dams above Elephant Butte Dam has had the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect of extending stream flow. Flood control and conservation storage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations do not, cannot, and have not been used to create or extend reaches  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of no flow in the riverbed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service agrees with the statement. Availability of flow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is likely not the only factor affecting decline of the silvery minnow. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations change the natural flow regime of the river and thus may affect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survival of the Rio Grande silvery minnow. The final rule recognizes these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other factors in the ``Summary of Factors Affecting the Species.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

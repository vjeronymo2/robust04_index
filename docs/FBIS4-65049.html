			<p>BFN     [Text] Strasbourg, France May 11 (A.A.) -- Foreign  Minister Hikmet Cetin signed a protocol on Wednesday [11 May]  concerning a "permanent court" which will be set up within the  Council of Europe's Human Rights Commission.    Only Italy failed to sign the protocol for technical reasons  which was to be signed by 32 countries. The permanent court  will replace Human Rights Commission and Court. Council of  Europe officials said the court functioning today has  difficulties in observing the cases because of an increase in  cases.</p>

I was assigned this task by the newly elected  members of the Duma of the Russian Federation," Mr. Ivan Rybkin,  chairman of the Duma, the lower chamber of Russia's Federal  Assembly, told the press. He is heading a Russian parliamentary  delegation which arrived here today.    The chairman of Bulgaria's parliament, Mr. Aleksandur  Yordanov, said he was happy that a Russian parliamentary  delegation of such a high rank has come to Bulgaria immediately  after the parliamentary elections and the passage of Russia's  new Constitution. "Mr. Rybkin and I will have the opportunity  to discuss various issues of bilateral cooperation as well as  legislation problems in connection with the reform in our  countries, and last but not least, we intend to discuss the  situation in the Balkans," he explained.    In connection with the latest developments in  Bosnia-Herzegovina Mr. Rybkin said that whatever happens, NATO's  ultimatum should not be carried out and that a peaceful way out  of the conflict will have to be found. Russian MP's believe  that in order to find a peaceful settlement, the concerned  parties should accept the proposal of the foreign minister, the  government and the president of Russia that the members of the  UN Security Council meet in Geneva and that all sanctions be  lifted.    During its four-day visit here the Russian delegation will  meet with Parliament Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov, the  parliamentary political forces, Foreign Minister Stanislav  Daskalov, and Prime Minister Lyuben Berov. The delegation will  also be received by President Zhelyu Zhelev.    Tomorrow the delegation is scheduled to visit Pleven (in  northern Bulgaria).</p>

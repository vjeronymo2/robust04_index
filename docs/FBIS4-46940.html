			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Marshal Ye. Shaposhnikov by Andrey Uglanov; </F> place and date not given: "Partnership for NATO?"]    [Text] This man was the last defense minister of the  USSR, the sole commander in chief of the CIS Joint Armed Forces,  and secretary of the Security Council of Russia. Today Marshal  of Aviation Ye. Shaposhnikov is the representative of the  president of the Russian Federation at the Rosvooruzheniye State  Company--an organization selling Russian weapons overseas.  Perhaps this appointment signifies the twilight of his military  career. But, in the opinion of a number of political scientists,  a pretty good political future might await him, given a certain  confluence of circumstances and his own desire.    [Uglanov] Yevgeniy Ivanovich, your opinion of the Armed  Forces of Russia. What awaits them? We know that the situation  in the Army is very difficult.    [Shaposhnikov] Next year it will, evidently, be even worse.  Three groups of factors are affecting the Army at this time. The  first is the lack of funding. We are today increasing  the funding of its upkeep thanks to a reduction in defense  contracting. But there will be nowhere to get the money from  next year. The second--destructive processes in the  Army continue. The reason for them, all else aside, is the loss  of an ideological reference point in the form of an enemy image  and the absence of effective institutions of educational work.  The third factor is the appearance of regional  influence on the Army. The leaders of certain regions are  flirting with the Army, laying claim to the role of its saviors.  If these three factors come together in one point at one and the  same time, there will be an explosion which could signify the  Army's uncontrollability.    [Uglanov] A very dim prospect.    [Shaposhnikov] Lest this happen, it is essential to do three  things, that is, create the conditions for a radical reform of  the Army. The first concerns the strategic missile  forces. It is essential to upgrade their combat readiness,  manning level, and hardware provision as the basis of the Armed  Forces. As long as we have them, no one will touch us.    The second is the strengthening and upgrading of  the border forces. And the third is the observance of  legality and law and order and the organization of an all-out  offensive against crime in all its manifestations. Having thus  protected ourselves against possible aggression from outside and  having secured order within the state, it will be possible  embarking on the building of a new army, taking the path of both  reforms and reductions.    [Uglanov] But, aside from the Army, there are tens of  millions of people employed in the military-industrial complex.  This is a delayed-action bomb. An explosion is expected from day  to day. A strike of the military-industrial complex is,  apparently, scheduled for 9 June.    [Shaposhnikov] Studying military-technical cooperation with  foreign countries, I discovered serious problems. More than just  our opportunities to export arms and military equipment will  depend on their resolution. I am talking about our capacity for  supplying the Russian Army with modern arms and, consequently,  for successfully defending ourselves in case of need. This  depends on the state of the military-industrial complex.    The label of "red conservatives" has, I regret to say, been  pinned on the leaders of defense industry. In reality, this is  the most patriotic, law-abiding part of our society. Their sole  shortcoming is a blind faith in state structures that have  proven powerless to do anything for them. Whence the talk about  the formation of their own political party, a merger with the  commercial banks, and so forth. It is for this reason, I  believe, that Prime Minister V. Chernomyrdin has, for all that,  concerned himself with this problem.    [Uglanov] But we have always earned terrific money from arms  sales. Why not allocate it for the development of the defense  industry?    [Shaposhnikov] Strictly speaking, in Soviet times we were  never involved in the sale of arms. They were supplied according  to the principle: "You respect me? You support my socialism?  Here you are, then." Tens of billions of dollars were lost, and  their return is greatly in doubt. The USSR leaders wanted to  gratify the world by their inordinate kindness. We were regarded  as fools.    [Uglanov] But we were paid for the weapons, all the same....    [Shaposhnikov] We received in exchange cheap, often sour,  wine, tomatoes, some pieces of this and that, and so on and so  forth. The year of 1985, for example, was the high point in  military-technical export cooperation. On the basis of such  principles of the arms "trade" we concluded agreements totaling  $16 billion and received in actual terms on the order of $2  billion. But where these billions went, no one knows. Into the  "granary of the motherland," evidently.    Today the plants and regions themselves are going to the  president and the government: "We are dying--allow us to move  onto the market." Many were allowed. And when they went  overseas, people locally were astonished by our insanity. Some  12-15 individuals and organizations would move after one and the  same deal, one and the same contract. They were competing with  one another, thereby knocking down their prices. The president  decided to close off all these loopholes and to retain one  channel for the sale of weapons--the Rosvooruzheniye. Although  the role of manufacturer should not be belittled, this should be  done in the channel of state laws and interests.    [Uglanov] You hold the cards here. You are a person who  knows  weapons and you are, furthermore, a pilot. Is it mainly aviation  equipment that is being sold?    [Shaposhnikov] You are right. If we take 100 percent as  being  the total, aviation accounts for 60-70 percent.    [Uglanov] Yevgeniy Ivanovich, you had your finger on the  nuclear trigger. The operational situation throughout the world  was reported to you daily. You must see some common development  of events from the viewpoint of the "warmup" of conflicts  throughout the world. How may they be extinguished, how may the  armed forces of blocs and individual states be used? Do you have  any thoughts in this connection? Is it right that Russia is  being pulled into NATO's Partnership for Peace program?    [Shaposhnikov] After World War II, mankind behaved like a  handful of street toughs. But we have reached a point where  there is no more Warsaw Pact and no more Soviet Union, but nor  is there at the same time clearly expressed opposition. And  military power has lost its precise, clear reference point in  the enemy image. This is understood by the leaders of NATO also,  and they have for several years now been in the mode of search  and explanations of their existence. Organizing the Partnership  for Peace is one such find.    Will Russia gain or lose from the Partnership? Let us  consider three scenarios. The first is the signing of  the treaty without reservations. In this case NATO's influence  would extend to the Pacific, to the borders of China, which does  not accept the Partnership as yet. This could signify a conflict  with our southeastern neighbor, which neither we nor China need.  The second scenario is a refusal to sign. Russia  would then be putting itself under conditions of isolation from  the Western world. NATO's borders would become closer to our  borders. Consequently, a new confrontation, a cold war, of which  the world has grown tired, is possible on this basis. The  third scenario is that of us seeking some special  role for ourselves in NATO or in the Partnership. I believe that  this is unworthy of a great Russia. Consequently, Russia should  propose to the world community something else worthy of its  authority and shared by the world community.    The time has now come, in my view, for thought to be given  the concept of states' nonbloc existence. Mankind does not need  military blocs but rather the perfection of the structures and  mechanisms that would secure both peace and prosperity on earth.  We have such mechanisms and structures: the United Nations, the  CSCE, the CIS, the Arab League, the Association of States of the  Pacific Region, the Organization of African Unity, and others.    In my view, one organization--the United Nations--should be  a  world organization and deal with general matters to ensure peace  and stability. It is necessary to this end to perfect the  military structure of the United Nations so that it makes  forecasts and analyses and offers the UN Security Council some  versions of a resolution of this problem or the other. And all  the other regional organizations (CSCE, CIS, and others) would  be components and structural subdivisions of the United Nations  with their missions at the United Nations and with UN missions  in them. They would tackle regional tasks. In place of NATO, a  CSCE peacekeeping contingent with a change of name and,  naturally, function would emerge. It would be involved in both  peacekeeping and in rendering assistance at the time of a  variety of natural disasters, accidents, and catastrophes and in  the delivery of humanitarian aid.    I have been telling the top-ranking NATO people for two  years  now: "Following the disappearance of the Warsaw Pact, you are  without a job, and this is why you are rushing into Yugoslavia  or some other venture. The time has come to transform your bloc  into a peacekeeping organization. But not on a world level,  rather under the auspices of the CSCE."    I have put this idea to the leadership of Russia also. As  yet, silence.... But unjustly so. In my view, our politicians  should not let slip their opportunity.</p>

			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / World Trade News: EC steel industry claims Poles dumping beams THE European Confederation of Iron and Steel Industries (Eurofer) claims Polish beams are being dumped in the European Community and plans to make a formal anti-dumping complaint to the EC Commission, A Eurofer spokesman said yesterday that the beams, used mainly in the construction industry, were being sold at an unfair price on the EC market. It believes the association agreement recently concluded between the EC and Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia could exacerbate the problem. Quantitative restrictions on imports from Poland disappeared at the beginning of January. Eurofer said it believes the association agreements 'will be interpreted by producers in these countries as an invitation to increase their exports . . . through abnormally low prices, favoured by considerable public subsidies.' A Eurofer official said the German industry was being hit hardest by the imports. Polish beams are being sold at around DM480 (Pounds 169), while EC prices are between DM150 and DM200 higher, he said.</p>

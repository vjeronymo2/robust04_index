			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Medeva jumps to Pounds 26m MEDEVA showed considerable expansion in 1992, with pre-tax profits rising from Pounds 7.82m to Pounds 26m over the opening nine months. Turnover almost doubled to Pounds 104.9m against Pounds 54.7m. Mr Bernard Taylor, chairman, said the improvement in margins was noteworthy as the group concentrated on higher value-added products. The nine-months figures have been issued in conjunction with the acquisition of Armstrong, a US specialised drug delivery manufacturer concentrating in the respiratory field, and on the reorganisation of Evans-Kerfoot. The results consolidate the effects of the purchase in July of International Medication Systems, a US maker of injectable products, and reflect the sale of some Pounds 11.4m stock of generic products bought by Norton Healthcare, reorganisation of Evans-Kerfoot and the disposal of the Horsham facility to Norton for Pounds 12m cash. Over the nine months there was net cash outflow from investing activities of Pounds 87m, leaving net borrowings of Pounds 43.8m at September 30. The Pounds 12m Horsham cash was received on November 3. See Lex</p>

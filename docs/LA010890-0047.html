			<p><P> January 8, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN FRANCISCO;  </P> <P> 3 SENT TO HOSPITAL AFTER CABLE CAR STOP  </P> <P> A cable car jolted to a stop to avoid a car while descending a hill, but there  were no serious injuries, authorities said. Several passengers complained of  minor pain after being knocked against poles and other inside parts of the  cable car on Mason Street, police said.  </P> <P> Three women passengers went to San Francisco General Hospital, where they were  in stable condition while being observed for possible injuries, a nursing  supervisor said. The incident occurred when a car made a left-hand turn in  front of the cable car at Union Street, said Police Officer Emmett Hickson.  Because the trolley was headed downhill, the gripman already had the brake on  and was forced to apply the emergency brake to stop, Hickson said.  </P></p>

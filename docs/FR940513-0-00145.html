			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some comments that opposed mandatory cost disclosures recognized that manufacturers might want to disclose some cost information voluntarily in point-of-sale materials. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 120 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several comments recommended that the Commission regulate how cost disclosures on packaging or in point-of-sale materials should be made, if the manufacturer wishes to make them. Of these, some recommended that the Commission require manufacturers to disclose the product usage period and energy cost assumptions upon which their cost claims were based. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 121 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Other comments suggested that the Commission should prescribe standardized assumptions for any voluntarily-made operating cost disclosures. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 122 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 120 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Osram (Supp.), G&hyph;11, 2; LBL (Supp.), GG&hyph;22, 4 (contending that the information necessary to make informed purchasing decisions between two lamps of different efficiencies and price takes two forms: Total operating costs, and total life-cycle costs. ``Since electricity rates vary considerably by region, hours of lamp usage vary by consumer, and retail price depends on factors outside the manufacturers' influence, it is difficult to present this information on a product label.

The Commission agrees that fluctuations in retail purchase prices for lamp products and utility company rebates make it a practical impossibility for manufacturers to disclose a meaningful total operating cost that includes purchase price. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 123 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Commission also agrees that varying energy rates and consumer usage patterns would make it necessary to require computation of annual operating cost on the basis of questionable assumptions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 124 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This would make it difficult, if not impossible, to provide current, accurate and meaningful annual operating cost information for prospective lamp purchasers. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 125 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Because purchasing decisions are likely to be made very quickly for lamps, which are relatively low-priced items, complicated disclosures involving operating costs are unlikely to be heeded by purchasers at the point of sale and may possibly be confusing. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 126 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Therefore, a required energy operating cost disclosure would not be useful in helping buyers make purchasing decisions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 127 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 123 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> To encourage the use of compact fluorescent lamps, some utility companies offer significant rebates to their customers for purchasing them.

According to GE, of industry sales of all incandescent lamps to residential purchasers in 1992, 36% were sold through mass merchants, 31% through food and grocery outlets, 22% through hardware and home center stores, 7% through drug stores and 4% through all other outlets. GE (Tr.), 105(4). Seventy eight percent of all these lamps are purchased by residential consumers walking themselves through the purchase decision, without expert assistance. GE (Tr.), 105(5). In addition, the average residential consumer spends 53 minutes total for all purchases per stop in grocery or food stores, GE (Tr.), 108, so the consumer obviously spends little time deciding which lamp to purchase in these stores.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 127 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In contrast, information disseminated to consumers in other ways, such as utility company bill inserts, may be more useful.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

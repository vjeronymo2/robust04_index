			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Letter: First step towards European integration recalled In your article, 'Nowhere else to go' (October 30), you relate how the prime minister said that the UK's first mistake in European policy was 'when we failed to join the Community at the outset', and ascribe that failure to Anthony Eden. I would put the failure back in time, to around 1950. The late Jean Monnet once described to me a meeting with Sir Stafford Cripps, then Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, and Edwin (now Lord) Plowden, then a Treasury adviser. In that meeting Monnet proposed that the UK should join the then projected Coal and Steel Community, making it clear that he was interested in more than just coal and steel, and that coal and steel were but a first step towards European integration. He was turned down. I referred to this meeting in a speech in the House of Commons on May 17 1961 (Hansard, vol 640, columns 1,429-1,437). Douglas Jay intervened to rebut my wider interpretation of Monnet's proposal. However, my memory of Monnet's conversation with me is quite clear and the wider interpretation is confirmed in Monnet's memoirs and in an anthology of speeches entitled Les Etats Unis d'Europe Ont Commence.

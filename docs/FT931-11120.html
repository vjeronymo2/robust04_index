			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / M0 growth exceeds target BRITAIN'S narrow measure of money supply, M0, grew by a seasonally-adjusted 4.1 per cent in the year to January, narrowly exceeding the target range set by the Treasury, for the first time since July 1990. But the government did not draw any special conclusions from the increase for the conduct of monetary policy because it was not matched by a similar growth in retail sales and because of divergent trends in other monetary indicators, including its broad money measure M4 and bank and building society lending. The Treasury in its monthly monetary report said low interest rates could be encouraging higher cash holdings and so fueling the growth of M0. It estimated that past cuts in interest rates 'may have added as much as 2 per cent to M0's increase over the last 12 months'. Revised Bank of England figures yesterday showed that bank and building society lending to the private sector fell in December by Pounds 74m after a drop of Pounds 86m in November, reinforcing the evidence of weak demand for credit. The Bank's estimate that this so-called M4 lending had increased by a lower than expected Pounds 200m in December was one factor that prompted Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to cut bank base rates last week to 6 per cent from 7 per cent. Mr Lamont yesterday met Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the Bank governor, for their monthly assessment of monetary conditions. The Treasury released the background report prepared for the meeting. This was in line with its new policy of openness adopted after the exit from the European exchange rate mechanism. The report suggested that contrasting movements of M0 and M4 could reflect the effects of low interest rates on M0, a divergence between consumer spending, which has gradually been strengthening, and continued caution by households and companies about borrowing for investment. The increase in M0 was in line with City expectations following an exceptionally strong 1 per cent rise in notes and coin in circulation, its main component, between December and January. Last month's 0.9 per cent rise in M0 compared with December lifted the annual rate of M0 growth above the government's 0 per cent to 4 per cent annual target range. M4, by contrast, fell by 0.1 per cent in December bringing annual growth to 3.7 per cent in the year to December, below its 4 per cent to 8 per cent 'monitoring range' set in November. Other parts of the report gave backing to last week's interest-rate cut. It said that forward-looking information from wage settlements and the Confederation of British Industry's industrial trends survey 'indicated further downward pressure on inflation in the pipeline'. There were few obvious signs of sterling's depreciation since September affecting producer output prices, or retail prices apart from petrol. The report acknowledged that recent monthly data on demand and activity was disappointing. But it added: 'Overall there is no evidence that activity in the second half of 1992 was weaker than forecast in the Autumn Statement'. Economic indicators, Page 23</p>

			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / SIB warns over regulatory body RETAIL financial services firms have little choice but to join a new proposed self-regulatory body which will set tougher standards for the industry generally and for life insurance in particular, the City's chief regulator warned yesterday. Mr Andrew Large, chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, said: 'We want there to be a new retail regulator, capable of accommodating all kinds of producers and all kinds of distribution for this most important group of products, the life products.' His remarks, made in a speech to the Life Insurance Association, stopped short of spelling out exactly what SIB will do if the banks, insurance companies, independent and tied sales agents fail to agree to approve the new body in sufficient numbers. He said that whether or not it was approved, it was clear that regulatory standards would have to rise. Also, the cost of regulation would rise, the financing of compensation to investors would continue to be expensive and contentious and the public would continue its clamouring for tougher regulation. He said firms that tried to avoid joining the new body - the Personal Investment Authority - by seeking direct regulation from SIB, would find it no soft option. 'I believe that all this will make for a somewhat unstable situation to say the least, the consequences of which I don't propose to try to predict today,' he said. Meanwhile Mr Large signalled he was not prepared to compromise significantly on the minimum standards the PIA is expected to set for new members. Independent financial advisers have reacted angrily to the proposal that each have minimum capital of Pounds 10,000. Mr Large said it was not unreasonable for those purporting to give broad-based financial advice to be able to demonstrate such resources. Mr Kit Jebens, chief executive of Lautro, the self-regulatory body for the life insurance industry, said at the same conference that in the coming year there will be considerable pressure to change the front-end commission structure of sales agents to a new formula of 'salary with bonus'.</p>

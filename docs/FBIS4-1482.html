			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg April 29 SAPA -- The counting procedure  of votes cast in South Africa's first all inclusive elecion will  be time consuming because it needs to be done carefully,  Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] Chairman Mr Justice  Johann Kriegler said on Friday [29 April]. He appealed to the  public to be patient as counting would be done meticulously.    This time-consuming process, which was also affected by the  breakdown of election administration in some areas, would  obviously affect the next two phases of the election procedure.  "This means, in a nutshell, that you (voters) must be patient,"  he said.    The next two phases are vote counting and announcing the  election results, Mr Justice Kriegler said.    IEC international Commissioner Brian Gould explained the  counting procedure in more detail.    Ballot boxes from about 9,000 voting stations will be sent  to  approximately 700 counting stations. Counting would not start  until voting taking place on Friday in six areas was completed.    Mr Gould said the second phase of the election process would  be the reconciliation of ballots in which counting officers open  ballot boxes to balance the number of votes in the box from  particular voting stations with the number issued at those  stations.    "We expect that in some cases the numbers will not  balance...  we are not running a fast food operation here," he said, adding  some problems could not be anticipated.    Mr Gould said reconciliation could "be bogged down" and take  a day or more if there were many disputed ballots or other  problems.    After reconciliation, the ballot boxes would be resealed  until the actual counting started. Mr Gould added some  reconciliation may take place on Friday.    During the counting, votes would be placed in piles  according  to the political party voted for.    A separate pile would be made for disputed votes. Counting  officials in conjunction with political parties would decide on  whether a ballot was disputed.    Mr Gould said four counting procedures would take place at  the same time. Two for provincial ballots and two for national  ones.    Counting results would be relayed by fax to the IEC's  operations room in central Johanesburg. From there the  provisional tallies would be made available to the media at the  IEC's nerve centre at Gallagher Estate, Midrand, he said.    Mr gould said the first provisional results could be  expected  around noon on Saturday.    He did not want to commit himself to an earlier time as  there  might be unexpected problems.    He said unexperienced staff would count the ballots and  might  need time to familiarise themselves with the procedure.    "We have no idea whatsoever how this will flow," Mr Gould  added.    Iec International Commissioner Jurgen Elkit said the  provisional results would be followed by the "final results  phase". At this stage all disputes needed to be resolved.    Seat allocation, the last and fastest phase of the election  procedure, would allocate seats in the national assembly and the  various provincial legislatures.    Seat allocation would not be influenced by the number of  voters, even if more voters than the IEC expected expected cast  their ballot.    Respsoneing to a question, J Elkit said he did ot want to  compare South African and European elections.    "This election is the first democratic election in a huge  country". Europe had gradually, over centuries developed "almost  perfect" election systems. It would be grossly unfair to make  comparisons.    Mr Justice Kriegler commented on the elections, saying:  "overall an outstanding success; not so much because of IEC  administration." He paid tribute to the patient voters who stood  in long queues to cast their ballot on Tuesday and Wednesday.</p>

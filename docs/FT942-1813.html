			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / International Company News: Colonia ahead sharply at DM309m Colonia yesterday reported a sharp increase in pre-tax profits for last year, and the insurer predicted that earnings in the current year would again be satisfactory, writes David Waller. Mr Claas Kleyboldt, chairman of the German group, which is a subsidiary of UAP, the French insurer, said the group had improved pre-tax profits to DM308.9m (Dollars 189.5m) up from DM248m in the previous year. Earnings per share climbed to DM55 from DM37.50. The improvement reflected a combination of reduced claims and increased premium income, a trend which had continued in the early months of the current year, Mr Kleyboldt said. In 1993, the gross premium for what is to be known as the CKAG group rose by 11.4 per cent to DM13.6bn, while the ratio of money paid to settle insurance claims to premium income in mainstream insurance business fell by 2.3 percentage points.</p>

			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ABORTION DEBATE  </P> <P> Let's get our terms straight: In today's controversy we use the misnomer  "pro-life" to mean those who oppose the right to a legal abortion. Stated  accurately, this small group of people is anti-choice.  </P> <P> I saw them in action at a clinic in Orange, these religious zealots who call  themselves right-to-lifers, who want to be thought of as super-humane. They are  not even decent: Their cruel harassment of each woman entering the clinic --  surrounding her car the minute it arrived, pushing themselves up to her as she  walked, shouting taunts in her face -- sought not to protect but to destroy her  right to life, and her right to liberty and the pursuit of happiness too.  </P> <P> Properly stated, these fanatics are pro-force -- determined to force their  narrow beliefs on everyone else. Let's use the right words, and know them for  what they are.  </P> <P> RUTH SULTZBACH  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

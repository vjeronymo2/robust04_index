			<p>Language: <F P=105> Afrikaans </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by De Wet Potgieter] </F>   [Text] Zulu warriors have for some time already been  undergoing military training on a large scale by right-wing  instructors at secret training camps in the mountains of  northern Natal and eastern Free State. The training in  guerrilla warfare is in preparation for what right wingers  describe as "the bloody war" expected between the African  National Congress [ANC] and the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] in  the run-up to the 27 April general election.    The secret training is the first official confirmation of  the  close military cooperation which exists between far-right  paramilitary organizations and the Zulus. These close ties are  not limited to the nonaggression pact recently signed between  the AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] and East Rand Zulus by  Mr. Eugene Terreblanche and Mr. Mwesi Twala in Vereeniging.  <H5>  Military Intervention </H5>   It appears that far-right underground organizations want to  intervene militarily should the Transitional Executive Council  [TEC] order the defense force to invade kwaZulu. It also appears  that the far right will become involved in the bloody war  between the ANC on the battlefields of Natal. This secret  training is not part of the kwaZulu government's official  training program for its so-called Community Protection Units  [preceding three words in English], which is being handled by  the kwaZulu Police.    RAPPORT has established that the far right has a fairly  effective intelligence network in place in northern Natal which  works closely with the Zulus. Mr. Zanzi Sibanda, regional IFP  organizer in northern Natal, confirmed to RAPPORT this week that  "widespread training" of Zulus is taking place in the area.  <H5>  Massacred </H5>   He claimed that his people are being massacred on a large  scale by ANC supporters, and their houses burned down. He  showed RAPPORT an ANC pamphlet which was distributed about a  week ago by the Madadeni branch in Newcastle, in which a call is  made for the ANC's "enemy" to be wiped out and their homes  burned down. "Kill the enemy or we perish," the pamphlet says.    Mr. Sibanda spoke to RAPPORT in the presence of the "Chief  of  Staff" of the Orde Boerevolk [Order of the Boer Nation], Mr.  Leonard Veenendal, and referred to Mr. Veenendal as not merely  an ally but "a good friend and brother." Mr. Sibanda said he is  very worried about white MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe -- Spear of the  Nation; ANC military wing] commanders who are brought in from  the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region to  establish ANC "self-defense units" in northern Natal. He named  two houses in the Dannhauser District where the ANC is storing  weapons, and which are regularly visited by ANC Natal Chairman  Mr. Harry Gwala.  War [subhead]    "The ANC is preparing for full-scale war in Natal and the  East Rand, in order to gain full control of these regions before  the election," said Mr. Sibanda. "That is why I welcome help  with the training of my people so that they can survive the  struggle."    He expressed his concern over the possibility that the TEC  will persuade the government to send defense force units to  "take over" kwaZulu, or that an ANC government would do the same  as President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, who sent the Fifth  Brigade into Matabeleland to suppress the supporters of Mr.  Joshua Nkomo.    Mr. Veenendal told RAPPORT that the Zulus and the Boers have  a common enemy, and that he had seen MK soldiers cold-bloodedly  murdering innocent women and children in Natal and burning down  their homes.</p>

			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Derivatives reacted sharply to the setback in European bonds following the release of German consumer data and the unexpected rise in Swedish interest rates. The increase in Italian interest rates came too late to impact on formal trading, writes Joel Kibazo. In futures, the September contract on the FT-SE 100 opened at 3,181. But for a brief move forward to 3,188 in the first half-hour of trading, the contract was in decline througout the day, with the lifting of interest rates in Sweden being the initial trigger to the selling. The mid-morning release of German consumer data unsettled bunds, leading to a further decline, but it was the selling of around 1,000 lots by US broker Refco Overseas which led to a sharp retreat in the contract over lunch. With Wall Street also dull, there was little to encourage a rally and September settled at 3,146, down 28 from its previous close and 8 points below its fair value premium to cash of 10 points. Volume improved to 19,459 lots. The announcement on Italian rates came towards the official close of trading, and dealers were left to react in after-hours' trading. September fell a further 19 points, signalling a poor session today. Turnover in traded options was 45,369 lots, of which 13,351 were in the FT-SE 100 option and 14,388 in the Euro FT-SE.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Communique of the Khmer Royal Armed Forces General Staff on </F> additional results in the total capture of Pailin area; dated 24  March -- read by announcer]    [Text] After totally capturing Pailin area on 19 March,  the Khmer Royal Armed Forces [KRAF] swept up those who  obstinately refused to lay down their weapons and return to  national society.    While launching the sweep operation in Pailin City, the KRAF  made an appeal and gave an assurance in line with the national  reconciliation policy of the Royal Government of the Kingdom of  Cambodia, which stresses:    1. The Royal Government of Cambodia [RGC] still recognizes  all compatriots as Cambodian citizens like all innocent  Cambodians in general who are currently living with the RGC.  The RGC always cares about the fate of all compatriots.    2. The RGC guarantees its recognition of the ownership of  land, houses, and all other property that the compatriots  possess currently in line with the provisions of the existing  laws of the Kingdom of Cambodia.    But, the obstinate Khmer Rouge ringleaders did not heed this  appeal. They instead launched attacks against the KRAF. In the  combat for self-defense, the KRAF killed 35 hardheaded Khmer  Rouge elements on the spot; seized a tank, 453 assorted guns, 70  metric tons of assorted ammunition, dozens of tons of war  materiel, two bulldozers, a Toyota car, a 751-A cistern, (?a  jeep), and 80-meter radio antenna.    [Signed] General Pan Thai for the KRAF General Staff    Issued on 24 March 1994</p>

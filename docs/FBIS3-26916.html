			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Central People's Radio reporter Su Kuoshan (5685 2368 </F> 0810) and XINHUA reporter Jia Yong (6328 3057)]    [Text] Beijing, 8 Feb (XINHUA) -- China will launch seven  satellites this year, a record year for satellite launching.    Except for "SJ-4" ["Shijian-4"], a space probing satellite,  and a simulated satellite, which were successfully launched  today, the other six are "FY-2" ["Fengyun-2'] meteorological  satellite, "DFH-3" ["Dongfanghong-3"] communications satellite,  a satellite for scientific exploration and technological  experimentation, all of which were developed and manufactured by  China; "Asia-Pacific-1" and "Asia-Pacific-2" satellites,  operated by the Asia-Pacific Satellite Company; and Australia's  "Aussat B-3" satellite.    According to a briefing by relevant experts, in the  launching  of the abovementioned satellites, new models, different types,  complex performance, and high technological demand are their  characteristics. Some satellites represent the popularization  and application of mature technology, others signal the opening  up of new technology and a new domain; some are for experiments  ascending to a new level; and others mark an important move by  China to ensure its place in the world domain of high science  and technology. Among them, the "SJ-4" space probing satellite,  which was launched by the "Long-March 3A" carrier rocket, was  launched for the first time on an experimental basis -- as will  the other second-generation applied satellites, such as the  "FY-2" meteorological satellite" and the "DFH-3" communications  satellite.</p>

			<p><P> July 4, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> SETTLEMENT OFFERED IN LIGHT POLE SUIT  </P> <P> A group of Ventura homeowners have proposed a settlement in the suit against  the Ventura Unified School District over four stadium light poles they say are  too tall.  </P> <P> Under the proposal presented to the Board of Education last week, the district  would reduce the height of the four poles at Larabee Stadium to 70 feet.  </P> <P> The two poles on the south side of the stadium are 80 feet tall, and the two  poles on the north side -- nearest the residences -- are 130 feet tall.  </P> <P> The homeowners say the new poles block their views and shine into their  hillside houses.  </P> <P> The stadium in the 2200 block of Poli Street is primarily used for Ventura High  School athletic events.  </P> <P> It also is used by Ventura College and other local schools, and is occasionally  rented by other organizations.  </P> <P> The district replaced its older light poles, which were 65 feet tall, late last  summer after some lights fell off during a strong wind.  </P> <P> The new poles cost the district about $150,000; about $25,000 came from  residents' groups that held fund-raisers, and the remainder was borrowed from  the city of Ventura.  </P> <P> Just before the lights were installed, the homeowners sued the district to  prevent installation of the lights. A judge, however, rejected their request.  KAREN McKEAN  </P></p>

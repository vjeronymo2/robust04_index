			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / International Company News: French champion is left reeling on the ropes - Alcatel Alsthom has been shaken by shifting markets and corruption probes Like a punch-drunk boxer, Alcatel Alsthom is reeling from a series of body blows that have rocked the French telecoms, transport and engineering group since the beginning of the year. Since Monday, Mr Pierre Guichet, head of Alcatel CIT, the group's telecoms equipment subsidiary, has been detained in prison by an investigating magistrate probing alleged overbilling of France Telecom, the state telecoms operator which is one of the company's largest clients. In July, Mr Pierre Suard, the company chairman, was placed under investigation on charges he used company funds for use on his private properties. Alcatel Alsthom's engineering joint venture with GEC of the UK has endured a strike which has halted production at several factories at the Belfort site in eastern France since the beginning of the month. It has issued two warnings concerning its expected profits for the year, while its share price has collapsed, falling by more than 50 per cent since its January high of FFr913. The blows are all the more spectacular given the company's previous rise to the top of French industry. After taking the helm in 1986, Mr Suard built the company into one of the country's most profitable and most respected business groups. In 1993, it racked up profits of FFr7.1bn (Dollars 1.33bn), more than any other private-sector French group. This year, net profits of about FFr4bn are expected - still a tidy sum, but the first fall since the company's rapid expansion was launched in 1987 with the acquisition of the European telecoms equipment operations of ITT of the US. Combined with its other woes, this has left investors shaken and rivals with a sense of Schadenfreude. 'It is quite a reversal,' says one Paris banker. 'People are now asking whether the giant has feet of clay.' That is one important question. Others concern the reasons behind the company's change in fortunes and whether it can respond to such setbacks. The company's ordeals partly reflect two fundamental trends confronting French industry: a campaign against corruption launched by an increasingly assertive judiciary, and the weakening of traditional ties between European state monopolies and private-sector suppliers. 'Alcatel is a symbol of the challenges facing some big French industrial groups,' says one electronics analyst. On the first count, Alcatel's legal woes are among the most intractable of a series of corruption investigations which have hit several French business leaders. Although little has been heard of Mr Suard's personal case since July, when he was placed under investigation, the probe into Alcatel CIT, the company's telecoms equipment subsidiary, has broadened. Mr Jean-Marie D'Huy, the magistrate pursuing the case, is assessing whether the company established a system of overcharging France Telecom for equipment. He has widened the investigation from transmission systems to alleged malpractice in the supply of switching systems. Alcatel firmly rejects any wrongdoing with respect to the ongoing probes. Mr Suard lambasted the failure to observe judicial secrecy in his investigation and has attacked the high-profile methods used by the magistrate. Mr Gerard Dega, vice-chairman of Alcatel CIT, said on Tuesday that 'this claim of overbilling is aberrant and absolutely does not apply'. The implications, however, are potentially worrying. 'It is serious,' says Professor Elie Cohen, director of CNRS, a research institute. He claims Alcatel, like other European telecoms suppliers, has enjoyed a privileged relationship with the state telecoms monopoly but that such close ties are unravelling. This trend is a result of deregulation and increasing emphasis on profitability by national operators preparing for privatisation and increased competition. 'The big problem for Alcatel is that this change in the relationship is now taking place in a poisoned climate,' says Prof Cohen. Alcatel does not break down its sales figures with respect to clients, but France Telecom is estimated to account for half Alcatel CIT's annual sales of FFr14bn. Contracts for the next two years are being negotiated. Moves towards liberalisation in the telecoms equipment market have cost the company dear in Germany. The shift by Deutsche Telekom towards international specifications and tenders for its supplies has prompted a sharp fall in prices for companies such as Siemens and Alcatel. The average price of switching equipment has fallen by about 15 per cent in Germany this year. At Alcatel SEL, the company's German subsidiary, the effects have been devastating. Mr Gerhard Ziedler, the chairman of Alcatel SEL says losses are DM1m (Dollars 643,500) a day. Losses in Germany are one of the principal factors in the forecast reduction in profits at the group and have prompted a significant restructuring. This month Alcatel SEL said it planned to cut 5,300 jobs  - almost one-quarter of the workforce - by the end of 1995. Industry observers have welcomed the move. 'They are finally biting the bullet in Germany,' said one electronics analyst at a French securities company. But he expressed concern that Alcatel had taken so long to realise the extent of the problem. The bigger question is whether Mr Suard's group can respond to the threats facing it. The chairman believes it can, arguing that 1994 will be the low point of the group's fortunes and next year will see an improvement. Mr Suard will be helped in his struggle by several positive factors. In particular, Alcatel Alsthom is buttressed by its diversity, in terms of products and geographical spread, and by its strength in new technologies. While the European telecoms market is proving an Achilles' heel, the company has made significant progress in emerging markets, particularly China. This year it expects to supply the Chinese market with about 7m lines of switching equipment, more than for the whole of Europe. Several operating divisions are also performing strongly. The acquisition this year of STC Submarine Systems from Northern Telecom of Canada has strengthened the cable division. In the US, Alcatel Network Systems has won significant broadband and switching equipment contracts from Pacific Bell, Bell Atlantic and other US telecoms groups. Ironically, the profitability of GEC Alsthom - which manufactures power generating and transport equipment - has been a factor in the strike at several of its plants. Trade unions, which are seeking to press companies to raise pay against a background of economic revival, claim that the company's financial position justifies their demands for a monthly salary increase of FFr1,500 - even though weakness in markets for some of its products, such as the high-speed train, the TGV, has prompted a cautious outlook from management. The dispute is now winding down following a vote on Tuesday in which the majority of workers favoured a return to work and a call yesterday by the communist-led CGT union for the removal of pickets. As for new products, the group reports strong success in its ATM and SDH systems. ATM, the latest generation of switching and transmission systems, is expected to play a strong role in the upgrading international telecommunications networks and the shift towards information superhighways. Similarly, the SDH, a digital transmission system, is enjoying strong demand, particularly in the US, where the company expects to book orders of Dollars 700m this year, Dollars 200m more than expected. Many industry observers concur. 'Alcatel is in a solid position for the medium term,' says Mr Jean Danjou, an analyst at Societe Generale. The problem, however, is the short term. The group is precariously positioned, confronted by a downward trend in profits and an increasingly complex legal tangle. It has yet to demonstrate it can respond.</p>

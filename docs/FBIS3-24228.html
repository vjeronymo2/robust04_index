			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Umar Ongov, city of Tashkent, under the rubric </F> "The Narcotics Business": "Uzbekistan: A Narcotics Window to  Europe?"]    [Text] The problem of drug addiction has no borders. It has  gone beyond the confines of individual regions and can no longer  be considered one of the social problems or forms of crime  outside the general economic and political context. The  narcotics business is actively invading the sphere of  international politics and world economics as a dominant factor.  That is the opinion of the International Narcotics Control  Committee expressed in the report of the director of the  regional representation of the UN program UNDKP [expansion  unknown], Arkadius Meydzhik. In a most direct way it affects  Uzbekistan, which at this time is one of the major consumer  states and transit zones through which narcotic substances are  transferred from Asia to Europe.    Despite the fact that, according to official data, only  4,400  drug addicts and 3,700 people potentially willing to use a drug  are registered in Uzbekistan. But the percentage of narcotic  substance users is much greater than the state statistics.  Incidentally, even governmental circles acknowledge this.    Unfortunately, UNDKP representatives do not have complete  information. Thus, according to Mr. Meydzhik, a characteristic  feature of some law enforcement organizations of Uzbekistan is  the unjustified top secrecy of the information they have. As a  result, UNDKP is forced to work with official statistics which,  alas, too often pass off wishes as fact.    At the same time, however, according to a sociological  survey  by independent experts and from sources close to law enforcement  services, 1 out of every 100 of the republic's residents may be  classified as persons who have tried narcotics at least once.  The percentage of those who regularly use these drugs is also  high. Drug use is most widespread among public transport  drivers, workers, college students, and vocational-technical  school students.    Cannabis is one of the main types of narcotics found in  Uzbekistan. Moreover, in some corners of the republic the use of  opium, especially its derivative koknar, is quite widespread.  Undoubtedly, the government of Uzbekistan is taking concrete  steps to resolve the problem, in particular regularly conducting  "Black Poppy" operations to destroy plantings of opium poppies  and developing programs to preserve industrial fields of hemp.  But the development and application of new criminal procedure  laws as well as ones now in operation which do not yet satisfy  the existing convention are needed. Contemporary information  systems and many other things must be introduced. And most  importantly, consolidation of all interested organizations is  needed rather than secrecy.</p>

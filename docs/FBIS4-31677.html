			<p>BFN     [Text] Knin, 13 Jun (TANJUG) -- The fact that the Croatian  delegation [to negotiations with the Krajina Serbs] accepted  Plitvice as a venue for talks on economic cooperation with the  Krajina delegation is a kind of recognition of the republic of  Serb Krajina [RSK], said RSK President Milan Martic at a news  conference in Knin today.    He said that the protocol for the talks was agreed with  UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces]. Krajina official bodies will  provide security at the talks. The official Krajina insignia  will be displayed in Plitvice except in the conference hall.    A single Croatian journalist will be allowed to attend the  talks. This is based on the principle of reciprocity since one  Krajina reporter was present at the recent talks in the Russian  Embassy in Zagreb.    Asked about the implementation of the Zagreb agreement by  the  Republic of Croatia, Martic said that he discussed this with  Butrus-Ghali's special envoy, Yasushi Akashi, and with  UNPROFOR's head of civil affairs in Sector South, Enrico  Aguillar. Martic said he was given guarantees that Croatia will  implement the provisions of the [Zagreb] agreement before the  Plitvice round of talks.    President Martic also commented on the latest statements by  Croatian officials about the reintegration of Krajina into  Croatia and their threats about a new war. We are closely  following the situation and we are ready to respond to a  possible Croatian reaction, Martic said, adding that he received  guarantees in Geneva that such behavior by Croatia will be  rigorously sanctioned by international factors.    The talks in Plitvice will primarily deal with economic  issues based on the principle of reciprocity. Certain  humanitarian issues should also be discussed, such as pensions  blocked by the Republic of Croatia immediately after the  outbreak of the war. In the long term there can be no permanent  cooperation with Croatia without annulment of UN Security  Council resolution 820 which left the Serb nation in the RSK in  a specific kind of isolation, Martic said, adding that there can  be no political and economic cooperation without the equality of  the partners.</p>

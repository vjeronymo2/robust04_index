			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Arts: Cheltenham Festival THE scene at Cheltenham Town Hall told a sorry tale. With a commendable degree of realism, only half the hall had been laid out with seats and even those were far from full. The recession has caught up with the Festival and visitors are averse to being adventurous. The programme was planned in more ambitious times. This year's theme is Switzerland's influence on 20th-century music, although by the middle of the festival fortnight there were already as many holes in that plan as in a portion of Swiss cheese. The events looked much more the traditional Cheltenham offering of varied new music, British and foreign, in readily digestible helpings. The main interest of the central weekend was the pairing of two new violin concertos: the first British performance of the second violin concerto by the Danish composer Poul Ruders and the premiere of the Violin Concerto by Paul Patterson. Each had its merits and, given the contrast in styles, they benefited from being heard in close proximity. Ruders is an individualist who has drawn inspiration from sources far and wide. Ives, Stravinsky, de Falla and Sibelius have all been mentioned in the front rank, with Tippett and Schnittke close behind, but none of those seemed the slightest bit relevant here. The Second Violin Concerto is mostly slow and melancholy (the composer's own word for the second of its four interlinked movements). If any style comes to mind, it is what Mahler might have done if he had lived to progress beyond the Tenth Symphony. The solo part consists of long, yearning lines which stretch upwards into the very limits of the violin's compass. The three slow sections are too similar and the fast fourth takes too long to arrive. But Rebecca Hirsch played every note of the solo part as though it was fit to burst with emotion. The brooding orchestral backdrop was provided on Monday by Kees Bakels and the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra. Two days earlier the Violin Concerto by Paul Patterson was less ambitious in where it wanted to go, but it is that much surer of its ground. The concerto is not too long, as the Ruders was, and its proportions are well worked out. The first brooding movement, a soulful threnody for the violin, fails to develop the argument sufficiently strongly for the rest of the concerto to seem a necessity. The slow movement, however, is appealing, if over-sentimental; the finale has sparkle. Malcolm Layfield visibly lived the solo part and the Goldberg Ensemble supported him with a trim accompaniment.</p>

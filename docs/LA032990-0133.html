			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARLIER CLASSES, STAFF AND BUS SERVICE CUTS PROPOSED FOR SCHOOLS  </P> <P> Some students would face a 7:15 a.m. school bell next year, and all juniors  would be required to take physical education classes if the Long Beach school  board approves budget cuts proposed this week.  </P> <P> Officials suggested that the start of school be moved up at least 35 minutes to  7:15 a.m. for some students to cut down on the number of school buses needed to  take children to school.  </P> <P> Officials also estimated that they would save as much as $400,000 by requiring  juniors to take physical education classes, which can accommodate larger  numbers of students. "By the very nature of a P.E. class, it's twice the size  of a normal class," said district Controller Tomio Nishimura. "That's one less  class we have to conduct for 11th grade." Physical education is mandatory for  9th and 10th graders.  </P> <P> The school board is considering these and other proposed cuts to balance the  district's budget, estimated at $350 million, for the 1990-91 school year.  </P> <P> School officials have submitted a package of cuts totaling $16.5 million. The  board would have to eliminate $11.5 million to balance the budget, officials  said.  </P> <P> Several management and clerical positions also would be eliminated, the overall  maintenance budget would be cut 5%, and new equipment purchases would be  frozen. About 75 custodial workers would be laid off.  </P> <P> School bus service would be eliminated for 641 students, and the average class  size would be increased by one student to 31 at all schools.  </P> <P> The plan includes a proposal to eliminate a music program in the elementary  schools, but several board members said last week that they don't expect to  touch any music programs.  </P> <P> One of the biggest changes for students and teachers would have those in  secondary schools setting their alarm clocks earlier, while those in elementary  schools would start their day 40 minutes later. The changes would allow school  buses to make three runs, instead of two, saving the district $800,000,  according to transportation director Richard Cassman.  </P> <P> Other transportation changes include eliminating bus service for 500 elementary  students and 141 Jordan High School students, which would save $250,000,  Nishimura said. Those students were allowed to ride the bus because of special  circumstances, he said, but many of those circumstances no longer exist.  </P> <P> At Kettering Elementary School, for example, 35 students get bus rides because  officials were concerned about students' walking across 7th Street. Students  can now get around the busy street by walking on a bridge crossing at  Studebaker Road, Nishimura said.  </P> <P> Elementary students generally are eligible for bus service if they live more  than 1.5 miles from school. The distance increases to three miles for high  school students, Nishimura said.  </P> <P> District officials say budget cuts are necessary because the Long Beach Unified  School District has been dipping into its reserves for years, and can no longer  afford to do so.  </P> <P> The district's reserves have declined from $29.1 million in the 1986-87 school  year to an estimated $12.8 million this year. "The district cannot continue  this pattern of deficit spending," Nishimura wrote in a report to the board.  </P></p>

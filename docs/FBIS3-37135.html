			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Vanichkin] </F>   [Text] Washington February 11 TASS -- The main objective of  the NATO policy in Bosnia is not the armed struggle against  Serbs, but the protection of the integrity of Sarajevo and of  residents of that city, U.S. President Bill Clinton told  journalists on Thursday [10 February].    Responding to the question on whether or not the NATO  countries are ready to start bombing Serbian positions in Bosnia  without the "silent consent" of Moscow, Clinton said one should  bear in mind that NATO's actions are in line with U.N. actions.  Russia, as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council,  took part in the drawing up of the U.N. policy in Bosnia.    Clinton said he had received a letter from the Russian  president on Wednesday morning. He would like to use it as a  basis for a telephone conversation with Boris Yeltsin, but could  not reach him by telephone. He hopes the Russian president will  agree to help in promoting the process of a peaceful settlement  in Bosnia.    The U.S. President said he did not know what technical  problems may prevent him from reaching Yeltsin by telephone for  the second day in succession. However, senior officials of the  two countries have been holding for two days active  consultations on the situation in Bosnia. Specifically, such  consultations were held by U.S. Representative at the United  Nations Organisation Madeleine Albright and U.S. Ambassador to  Russia Thomas Pickering. According to Clinton, there is no  reason to believe that some serious problem may hamper the joint  advance of the two countries.    Dee Dee Myers, press secretary of the U.S. President, said  at  a briefing in the White House that Clinton and Yeltsin had not  been able to speak on the telephone for technical reasons and a  considerable time difference. President Clinton tried to reach  Yeltsin by telephone on Wednesday, but, unfortunately, they did  not have a conversation, the press secretary continued. He  repeated his attempt on Thursday. They have not managed to  speak so far, and she hopes Clinton will make it on Friday.</p>

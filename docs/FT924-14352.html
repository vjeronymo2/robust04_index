			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Letter: Suppliers victims of supermarket squeeze Sir, What a nerve Mr Robey] ('Tesco executive attacks 'second rate' suppliers', October 7). And from a company whose late chairman's motto was 'Pile it high and sell it cheap'. Sir Jack Cohen had the right ideas by giving the public a fair deal and food at affordable prices, to an acceptable quality. What have we now? Five supermarket chains which control the whole grocery trade. And it is they, not the suppliers, which have introduced thousands of 'me-too' products by the introduction of own-label brands. Where's the choice? And where's the quality? The supermarket chains have been able to nit-pick about quality or price with the unfortunate own-label packers which, because of the financial pressure placed upon them, will agree to almost anything to stay in business. How many times have suppliers to the main chains been asked to contribute to 'promotions' by the chain in question? If you do not play ball they delist your product. How many times have packers agreed a programme, and been issued a contract by the buyer, only to receive a call a few days or weeks later to be told by the supermarket that it has been quoted lower prices elsewhere and wishes to renegotiate the contract. This after the supplier has committed itself to labels, packaging materials, cans, fruit or vegetables. The supplier can either agree, which will often mean that his very slim profit margin goes, or, he can tell the buyer that he has a court case on his hands. It is easy to guess what happens in real life. The five supermarket chains will shrink to four, then quite possibly to three. Meanwhile, just study the margin of profit over the last few years of the chains, up from 1 per cent to over 6 per cent. It is the suppliers who, in the process, have felt the screw.

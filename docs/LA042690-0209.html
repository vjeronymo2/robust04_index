			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A NEW WORLD FOR EAST EUROPEAN FILMMAKERS;  </P> <P> MOVIES: DIRECTORS ADJUST TO FREEDOMS AT HOME AND THE PROSPECT OF COMPETING IN  THE INTERNATIONAL MARKETPLACE.  </P> <P> "Suffering is more cinematic than happiness," says Polish director Krzysztof  Kieslowski on a subject that East European filmmakers perhaps know better than  anyone else. But now with the end of 45 years of communist domination,  filmmaking, like every other aspect of life in East Europe, is adjusting to the  new demands of freedom. The oppression may be over, but the cinematic future of  the region is far from settled. Even how to refer to the directors -- European  or East European -- is a matter of debate as more than 20 directors arrive in  Los Angeles to participate in the AFI L.A. FilmFest that is featuring 40 films  from Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> Their conversation is rich in metaphor, perhaps as a result of evading  censorship for so many years, as they consider the paradox of their freedom.  "Now that we have the liberty to make films, we don't have the money," said  Lyudmil Staikov, director of the epic "Time of Violence" and president of the  Bulgarian film industry.  </P> <P> Round-faced and earnest, Staikov is "proud that some of the films made by our  industry were the basis for social change." But, surprisingly, it is not  politics that he or his colleagues want to talk about. "I feel for the first  time I don't have to be political. My films can be more personal and more  commercial," said Gyula Gazdag, the young Hungarian director of "Stand Off" who  is now a visiting professor at UCLA.  </P> <P> How to find the money to make those films is now the main topic of  conversation. Overnight, the East Europeans must compete on the world market  with French, German and other international filmmakers. Against the worldwide  dominance of hard currency, the film industries of Poland, Czechoslovakia,  Hungary, Bulgaria and even the Soviet Union must reinvent themselves from  scratch while coming up with a formula to attract an audience at home and  abroad.  </P> <P> "What kind of films should we make and for whom?" asked Kieslowski. And in  Poland as everywhere, "the audience is always right and the author always  wrong. Who has more freedom, someone subsidized by the audience or by the  state?"  </P> <P> After a limited diet of approved films, East European audiences are hungry for  big American movies, not art. To survive, directors will have to find a way to  meet commercial demands without sacrificing the originality of their vision, a  dilemma seemingly faced by filmmakers everywhere.  </P> <P> Irina Aktascheva, Bulgarian co-director of "Monday Morning," hears rallies in  the streets and wonders how she can capture that audience for her films. "Right  now, people don't have enough to eat. If we can't raise the money internally,  we have to find sponsorship abroad, and that's doubtful. I'm sure there won't  be money for films for the next five years in Bulgaria."  </P> <P> But the need for hard currency is real. Even in the Soviet Union, quality film  stock and equipment from the West can only be acquired with hard currency and  without it, production values are not high enough to sell a film on the  international market. The obvious solution is co-production.  </P> <P> But is there a place for the often dark vision of unknown East European  directors in an American-driven market where foreign hits are becoming as rare  as $2 bills? "No one is interested in Poland or Polish history," said  Kieslowski, "and an American audience is completely not interested. They see it  all on the news."  </P> <P> Gazdag disagreed. He believes that Americans are curious about Eastern Europe  and considers Hungary's 900-year history of enslavement fertile ground. "The  stories we've lived through are so interesting and unusual and so much more  dramatic than what Americans are used to."  </P> <P> Whether these stories can be told in English for an international audience  without watering down the vision that makes them special was a hotly debated  topic at a panel discussion Sunday. The brightly dressed Soviet filmmaker and  poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko was against it, urging his fellow filmmakers to "save  the flame of real art and inspiration. . . . We must continue to feel pain, but  pain of great quality."  </P> <P> Staikov took a more down-to-earth approach. Sounding remarkably like any  producer anxious to make a deal, he promised a Bulgarian industry that would be  more responsive to commercial considerations and international taste. "The  important thing is to have conditions to work in. We won't lose our identity by  working abroad," he said, pointing to the work of Forman, Skolimowski, Polanski  and Tarkovsky.  </P> <P> The most recent sign of the international appeal of East European cinema is a  commitment by Kieslowski to do his next four films for French producers,  possibly shot in English, for a world market.  </P> <P> But most co-production is still on the level of foreign companies using the  facilities, locations and some below-the-line talent to shoot a project that  has nothing to do with the local culture.  </P> <P> Staikov acknowledges that the effect of outside location shooting in Bulgaria  could be a "tragedy," but he promises not to let his country be overrun by  future co-productions. "We don't want to make a lot of money. Just enough to  keep our industry afloat."  </P></p>

			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / EC puts together deal on rules for banana imports THE European Community last night finally agreed its controversial new rules for the import of bananas. The rules are considered illegal by Germany, opposed by the Benelux countries inside Europe, and seen as a job-destroying impediment to trade by Latin American banana growers. The agreement required the current Danish presidency of the EC to bury its own objections so as to get a settlement. Only Germany and Denmark opposed the deal last December, when political agreement was supposedly reached. Since then, the Benelux countries discovered new objections. The deal last night reflected fears that EC decision-making might be brought into discredit by the Dutch and Belgians reneging on the original plan. Cabinet decisions were needed in the main countries involved. Holland and Belgium maintained their opposition, amid charges that their word would be in question in future Euro-decisions. The deal sets a quota of 2m tonnes on cheap Latin American bananas coming into the EC, with an Ecu850 (Pounds 696) per tonne tariff - about 170 per cent - above that volume. Independent Latin American producers, as well as the main US multinationals supplying the EC market, organised the most intensive lobbying campaign the EC has ever seen to try to change the terms of this deal. They failed. But the slightly modified deal makes some attempt to preserve the rights of existing importers and makes it easier to raise the import quota in line with demand. Latin American producers still intend to challenge the rules through Gatt, and Germany still threatens to take the decision to the European Court of Justice to keep unimpeded access for banana imports of its choice.</p>

The state delegations for withdrawal talks voiced the  probability during mutual consultations, Andrejevs noted. The  next round of talks is scheduled to open Monday in Moscow.    As reported, Russia offered Latvia 2 million USD per each  year of the operation of the radar after the troop withdrawal is  completed. The Latvian counterproposal was 400 million U.S.  dollars per year.    Chief Russian negotiator Sergei Zotov has no authority to  alter the Russian proposal but Latvia also cannot make that  large concessions, said Andrejevs.    In addition, Andrejevs said that Russia has drafted a  timetable for the withdrawal of troops from the Baltic country.    The command of Russia's Northwest Army group only needs a  signed interstate agreement to start implementation of the  timetable, Russian Ambassador Aleksandr Rannikh has told  Andrejevs.    The issue of social guarantees for Russian military  pensioners could be tackled jointly with the Conference on  Security and Cooperation in Europe experts if the delegations  fail to reach an agreement by themselves, the minister said.    As reported, Russia has promised to withdraw the remaining  troops by Aug. 31 if Latvia allows it keep the radar station for  five and a half years.</p>

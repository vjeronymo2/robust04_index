			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 75.360&blank;Preshift Examination <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> MSHA is proposing several modifications to the requirements in the existing &sect;75.360, Preshift examinations. Paragraph (e) would be removed, existing paragraphs (f) through (h) would be redesignated as (e) through (g), paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (f) would be revised, and new paragraphs (b)(8) through (b)(10) would be added. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The informational meetings and later discussions on the rule indicated some confusion over the application of preshift examination requirements to pumpers. The questions focused on the need to preshift examined areas of the mine where pumpers were scheduled to work or travel. In response to these questions, the Agency has reviewed its position on this issue and has determined that the interest of safety is best served by permitting pumpers to perform examinations for themselves, provided they are certified. The existing regulation requires that areas where pumpers are assigned to work or travel be preshift examined even if the pumper is certified. The proposal would modify &sect;75.360 by requiring in proposed paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) that certified pumpers perform these examinations if the area has not been preshift examined. However, if the pumper is not certified, the proposal would continue to require the areas where the pumper is assigned to work or travel to be preshift examined. Paragraph (a)(2) of the proposal would require that the pumper make a record by or at the end of the shift of all hazardous conditions found. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As with other examinations required by this subpart, no one may accompany the pumper during this examination. If persons other than the certified pumper are scheduled to enter the area, a preshift examination is required. However, pumpers may conduct supplemental examinations in accordance with &sect;75.361 for other persons, provided certified pumpers: (1) have been designated by the operator to conduct these examinations; (2) conduct these examinations within 3 hours prior to anyone's entering the area; and (3) conduct these examinations in areas where persons were not scheduled to work prior to the beginning of the preshift examination. The proposal would provide at least the same level of safety as the existing regulation because a complete examination by a certified person would still be required and the examination would be conducted closer to the time that miners would actually enter the area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (b) is proposed for revision to address conditions to be checked by the preshift examiner. Under the existing rule, the preshift examiner is required to examine for hazardous conditions. The preamble to the existing rule states the Agency's position that ``Most `hazards' are violations of mandatory standards.'' (57 FR 20894, May 15, 1992.) It further states that requiring a preshift examiner to look for all violations could distract the examiner from the more important aspects of the examination and that a district manager could require the preshift examiner to include examination for other hazards. Upon reconsideration, the Agency is proposing that the preshift examination be expanded to include an examination for noncompliance with mandatory safety or health standards that could result in a hazardous condition, as well as other hazardous conditions. This proposal places the examiner and the operator in a proactive rather than a reactive role and therefore has the potential to enhance safety by identifying a condition before a hazard exists. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under proposed paragraph (b)(1), roadways, travelways and track haulageways where persons are scheduled to work or travel during the oncoming shift must be preshift examined. The proposal would clarify that the preshift examination includes travelways in addition to roadways and track haulageways. This is being proposed based on comments received that the terms ``roadways'' and ``track haulageways'' specifically refer to areas where mobile powered equipment is operated. The addition of the term travelways in the proposal would require areas where persons are scheduled to travel on foot to also be preshift examined since hazards may also exist in these areas. The remaining portion of the existing paragraph has been transferred to paragraph (b)(10). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed paragraph (b)(3) would require an examination for hazardous conditions and noncompliance with mandatory safety or health standards that could result in a hazardous condition, tests for oxygen deficiency and methane, and a determination if the air is moving in its proper direction on any section that is not scheduled to operate but is capable of producing coal by simply energizing equipment. This is in addition to the existing requirement that these examinations and tests be made on working sections and areas where mechanized mining equipment is being installed or removed. It has been the Agency's position that sections that are capable of producing coal by simply energizing equipment should be examined in accordance with &sect;75.361, Supplemental examinations. However, as pointed out by commenters, a number of fatalities have been the result of persons being sent into areas that should have been examined but were not. Because there is a reasonable likelihood that miners will at some point during a working shift enter sections that are set up to mine coal, the Agency is proposing that these sections be preshift examined. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency has become aware of an opinion of a segment of the mining community that those parts of &sect;75.360 related to areas where mechanized mining equipment is being installed or removed were promulgated without the benefit of adequate comment. Although the Agency believes that the promulgation of this standard was done appropriately, it is being reproposed for the purposes of receiving and giving consideration to all pertinent comments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As stated in the preamble to the existing rule, ``The Agency has always considered these areas to be subject to the requirements of the preshift examination; however, an investigation following an explosion at the William Station Mine indicated that some confusion existed on this issue.'' (57 FR 20894, May 15, 1992.) The Agency's position on this issue remains unchanged at this time; however, comments are specifically solicited relative to the need to preshift examine these areas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

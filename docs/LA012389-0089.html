			<p><P> January 23, 1989, Monday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> HIGH COURT UPHOLDS STATE BAN ON TESTIMONY ADS FOR LAWYERS  </P> <P> The Supreme Court let stand a California rule that virtually bans all lawyer  advertisements featuring testimonials or client endorsements.  </P> <P> Six months after the high court said it would use a challenge to the California  rule to issue a decision that would bind all the states, the justices dismissed  the case today.  </P> <P> The court's one-sentence opinion said a Los Angeles lawyer's appeal was being  dropped "for want of a properly presented federal question."  </P> <P> Mark H. Oring of Los Angeles was reprimanded by the California Bar Assn. for a  radio commercial in which a client who had been involved in an auto accident  praised Oring and his partner.  </P> <P> Oring said the state rule presuming that testimonials are deceptive violates  his free-speech rights. The California Supreme Court rejected Oring's challenge  to the rule in 1987, and today's action by the U.S. high court leaves the state  rule undisturbed.  </P></p>

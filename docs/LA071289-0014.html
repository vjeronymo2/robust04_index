			<p><P> July 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRISONS AND DRUG ABUSERS  </P> <P> Your editorial, while correctly pointing to substance abuse as the primary  cause for our overcrowded jails and prisons, doesn't go far enough in focusing  on solutions. Building more jails and expanding treatment programs should be  important components of any anti-drug strategy; however, in the long run,  prevention through education absolutely must be the spearhead of our united  efforts.  </P> <P> We must guarantee that all our youngsters are "inoculated" through an infusion  of knowledge of the dangers of substance abuse when they are most susceptible  to that information. Programs where schoolteachers and law enforcement officers  join to build self-esteem, coping skills, as well as accurate information about  drug use, must be expanded throughout our county and nation.  </P> <P> Although programs such as our department's Substance Abuse and Narcotics  Education (SANE) and the Los Angeles Police Department's Drug Abuse Resistance  Education (DARE) are only a few years old, they offer the best hope for  reducing the appetite or demand for drugs and alcohol.  </P> <P> The more the media can call the attention of their readers and viewers to this  simple truth, the faster teachers, cops, parents and taxpayers and everyone  else who has a stake in this country's future can stop reacting to this problem  and start preventing it.  </P> <P> SHERIFF SHERMAN BLOCK  </P> <P> Los Angeles County  </P></p>

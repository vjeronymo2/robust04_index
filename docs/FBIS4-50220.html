			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Wang Yanbin (3769 6056 1755): "State Councillor </F> Chen Junsheng Urges Various Localities To Be Based on Serious  Flood Control and To Be Well Prepared for Serious Disaster  Control"]    [Text] Beijing, 15 May (XINHUA) -- Chen Junsheng,  Councillor of the State Council and head of the State Flood  Control and Drought Relief Headquarters, emphatically pointed  out today: General demands for flood control and drought relief  this year are as follows: We should be based on conducting the  work of serious flood control and serious drought relief.  Efforts should be made to take a two-handed approach toward  flood control and drought relief, to make necessary preparations  for preventing serious disasters, to ensure the safety of the  people's lives and property, and to reduce the losses caused by  flooding and drought as much as possible. In conducting flood  control, we should regard the work of reducing the casualties of  personnel in the operation as a prominent task.    Niu Maosheng, minister of water resources, delivered a  speech on introducing the situation at the first plenary session  of 1944 sponsored by the State Flood Control and Drought Relief  Headquarters today, in which he said: Although the action taken  by various localities for the preparatory work of flood control  this year has been relatively satisfactory and the relevant  departments under the State Council have earnestly made  preparations for flood control in line with the duties assigned  by the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters, we  are still facing a severe situation in the flood control work  this year because the standards of flood control work set for  large rivers and by urban areas are generally on the low side;  difficulties in applying the areas to relieving or blocking the  flooding flows are large; measures to allocate the operation of  flood control are backward; institutions in some localities in  charge of flood control and drought relief are not sound; funds  for flood control and drought relief are short; and the  term-shift changes of personnel in charge of commanding the  operation of flood control and drought relief are large, which  have caused the large number of new hands who lack the  experience of commanding and allocating the operation in the  work. Therefore, it is necessary for us to make greater efforts  in this regard.    During the plenary session Chen Junsheng urged various  localities and the state departments concerned not only to  ensure the safety of large rivers and lakes during the flooding  period but also to attach great importance on the flood disaster  along medium-sized and small rivers and streams, around the  medium-sized and small reservoirs and towns, along the main  traffic lines, and around the important industrial and mining  enterprises; as well as on the mountainous disasters of torrents  and landslide caused by the tropical storm. It is imperative to  accelerate the formulation of fore-plans for serious flood  control and to enforce the responsibility system with the duties  undertaken by the administrative leaders as the core. By no  means should we allow the recurrence of vicious incidents.  Various localities should establish or improve the organs in  charge of flood control and drought relief, increase the funds  for these purposes, and upgrade the capability of personnel at  all levels in carrying out flood control and drought relief.  Various departments concerned should realistically perform the  duties and obligation imposed on them for flood control and  drought relief and follow the spirit of safeguarding the whole  situation to support the work of flood control and drought  relief.    Chen Junsheng pointed out: In order to realistically do a  good job in the work of flood control and drought relief this  year, the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters  recently organized six inspection groups of flood control to  carry out inspection prior to the flooding period. These groups  led by the head or deputy heads of the state headquarters  carried out inspections among Chang Jiang, Huang He, Hai He,  Huai He, and Taihu Lake, as well as among the key cities that  are chiefly assuming the work of flood control and among the  mountainous areas that are prone to more disasters. They also  conducted jointly with the local people's governments the  official work on the spot and dealt with the existing major  problems in a timely manner.    Chen Junsheng emphatically said: Currently, the flooding  period has come. Some provinces in south China have prevailed  flood and disaster situations in succession. Governments at all  levels should attach great importance on them and realistically  enhance their leadership over the work. Departments at all  levels in charge of flood control should go into action  immediately, take up the work that they should do, fulfill their  duties, and be ready to meet every possible flood or drought  disaster at all times.</p>

			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Traps for incautious taxpayers - The Revenue can make mistakes and you should always check its figures Tax returns are flowing into the Inland Revenue, most for the 1993/94 tax year. But since the Revenue admits it makes mistakes, you should always check the contents of the brown envelope. You can easily get four separate assessments for one year's income: self-employed earnings, employed earnings, untaxed income and tax income - not to mention capital gains. While each assessment follows the same logical outline, here are some points to watch for. Income Normally, this presents no problems for Schedule E (pay as you earn) taxpayers as employers provide them with details of salary and benefits. But all other sources should be checked carefully. Allowances Often, these are wrong. Ask yourself the following questions: 1. Does your assessment include your personal allowance (Pounds 3,445)? 2. If you are married, either you or your spouse should benefit from the married couple's allowance (MCA). Does one of you have it? For 1993/94, it is Pounds 1,720 for those under 65, Pounds 2,465 where the elder spouse is under 75, and Pounds 2,505 where the elder spouse is 75 or over. 3. If you are over 65, you have a higher personal allowance (even higher if you are 75 or more) provided that your total income is Pounds 14,200 or less. Is this shown on your assessment? 4. Did you pay personal pension contributions or additional voluntary contributions (AVCs) in the tax year? If you are self-employed, you should get relief in the allowances section of your assessment. If you are an employee, you will have had basic-rate tax relief when you paid contributions, so you will be due further relief only if you are a 40 per cent taxpayer. If you are self-employed, half of your class 4 national insurance contribution (NIC) - which is calculated separately at the bottom of the page - is given as an allowance. But there can be errors. There is no Class 4 NIC on profits below Pounds 6,340 for 1993/94, so an assessment showing a lower limit of nil is wrong. Even if the line 'Amount chargeable to tax' is correct, you need to check that the tax rates are right. For 1993/94, the first Pounds 2,500 is charged at 20 per cent, the next Pounds 21,200 at 25 per cent, and 40 per cent thereafter. The fun starts if you have dividends. There is no more to pay if you do not fall into the 40 per cent band, but there are complications if your dividend income straddles the 25 and 40 per cent bands. Your capital gains are treated as the top slice of your income. The bottom box on the assessment, 'Allocation of allowance and rates of tax' can be confusing. You, the taxpayer, have the right to choose the way in which you set your personal allowances against your income. It will usually be to your advantage to set them off against the income which is taxed earliest. If you are an employee, the Revenue normally will do this for your through the Paye system. But in order not to raise assessments for trifling sums, the Revenue usually will restrict your allowances instead. If, say, you are a married man with a salary of Pounds 40,000 in 1993/94, taxed interest of Pounds 1,500 (net), untaxed income of Pounds 150, and a deed of covenant in favour of your parish church for Pounds 100 a year, your allowances total Pounds 5,165. The Revenue probably will not assess the Pounds 150 but, instead, will restrict the allowance on your Schedule E assessment to Pounds 5,015. This will show up both in the 'Allowances etc' section and the 'Allocation' section. Gift aid You can make donations to charities by deed of covenant or under the Gift Aid scheme; these are allowable against your higher-rate tax bill. But relief for a charitable deed of covenant is slightly complicated. You make your gift net of basic rate of tax of 25 per cent. For tax purposes you have paid Pounds 133, from which you have deducted Pounds 33 tax. If you pay higher-rate tax, you get relief for your donation by having your 25 per cent band increased by Pounds 133. So, your basic-rate band of Pounds 21,200 will be increased to Pounds 21,333. The effect of this is that you will pay tax at 25 per cent on Pounds 133 of your income which otherwise would have been taxed at 40 per cent.</p>

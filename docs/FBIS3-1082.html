According to the authorities, he  narrowly escaped a murder attempt during a religious ceremony.  The attempt was only revealed last night, and the government is  using the incident as a stick to beat the opposition with. From  Moroni, the Comoros capital, Kamardine Mohammed faxed this  report:    According to last night's statement, the attempt was going  to  be made by a former presidential guard, who was arrested on the  spot--armed with a pistol hidden in his jacket. The statement  was broadcast on Radio Comoros following an emergency meeting of  the government yesterday afternoon.    In a stinging attack, President Djohar's press attache, Ali  Jei, denounced the opposition. Ali Jei claimed that initial  investigations showed that the arrested man, Fayar Oumar, was  hired by the opposition. The press attache claimed that the man  was promised $3,530 and a ticket to go to the French island of  Mayotte.    The opposition has rejected the accusation, pointing out  that  the alleged would-be assassin was a bodyguard for a ruling party  member of the Federal Assembly. They also say that the man was  carrying a starter pistol. Abass Youssouf, the leader of the  opposition umbrella organization, the Forum for National  Recovery, told me this afternoon that this accusation was just a  manipulation to discredit the opposition.</p>

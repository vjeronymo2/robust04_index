			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] NTT Basic Research Laboratories has developed an  ultra-sensitive molecular detection technique that can detect a  concentration of 2 ppt (parts per trillion), the concentration  of sugar that would result if a sugar cube weighing three grams  were dissolved in 1.5 million tons of water, a volume roughly  three times the size of the Kasumigaseki Building. The detection  technique is based on electrochemical methods, but the  sensitivity is a thousand times greater than with conventional  methods. This technique can detect slight variations in the  concentration of substances present in trace amounts in body  fluids, so it can aid in the diagnosis of illness, and it can  also be used to study the behavior of neurotransmitters and help  clarify the mechanism of information transfer. Wide-ranging  applications in basic medicine and bioscience can be expected  for this technology.    Among the ultra-sensitive methods for detecting molecules in  liquids there is the ``radiochemical-enzymatic method,'' in  which a special reagent that contains a radioactive isotope and  that will react with the substance of interest is allowed to  bind to the substance of interest, and the concentration of the  substance of interest is determined by the quantity of  radioactivity. There is also the ``chemiluminescence method,''  in which a special fluorescent reagent is allowed to bind to the  substance of interest, and the concentration is determined by  measuring the fluorescence. There are difficulties, however,  because in both cases these special reagents are difficult to  handle, and the procedures are complex. In addition, the  ``electrochemical method'' has also been used because it is fast  and simple.    The new detection technique developed by NTT is a kind of  electrochemical method. The electrochemical method is one in  which the concentration of a substance is determined from the  current and voltage during electrolysis of a liquid containing  the substance of interest. With previous electrochemical  methods, however, it has been impossible to accurately detect  the concentration corresponding to the value for the current  when the current is very small, so these methods were not  suitable for the detection of substances at extremely low  concentrations.    The reason for such low sensitivity is that the electron  exchange between the electrode and the substance of interest is  only one electron per molecule, so the resulting current is  extremely small. Researchers at NTT thought that if they could  solve this problem, they could make use of the simplicity and  speed of the electrochemical method and at the same time create  a system that would enable detection with high sensitivity. They  came up with an electrochemical reaction system based on the  completely new concept of using small, comb-shaped electrodes to  increase the current value.    With this system, one of the electrodes that carries out the  electrochemical reaction with the substance of interest is  shaped like a comb with narrow spaces between the teeth, and  another electrode of the same shape is paired with it so the  teeth interlock but do not touch. The molecules of the substance  of interest accept an electron from one of the comb-shaped  electrodes and donate that electron to the other comb-shaped  electrode. Therefore, the molecules repeat the electron exchange  (redox) reaction many times. This change in design alone has  resulted in a current about 30 times greater than with  conventional electrochemical methods.    In addition, to obtain a larger current, the comb-shaped  electrode is connected to another electrode in a separate vessel  that contains metal ions. This electrode continues to receive  electrons from the comb-shaped electrode, which acts as a medium  for the substance of interest. Those electrons are donated to  the metal ions in the separate vessel, so in the separate  vessel, the ions become metal atoms and precipitate. This metal  becomes a cumulative record of electrons that the substance of  interest carried between the two comb-shaped electrodes. If a  current is then passed in the opposite direction, a current peak  about 1000 times greater than with conventional electrochemical  methods can be obtained. When we know what kind of substance we  are measuring, by measuring peak current we can determine the  concentration. Since the current peak is amplified 1000 times,  the concentration can also be measured with the same precision.    The molecular detection technique developed by NTT can also  measure electrochemically inert substances if there are active  substances that react specifically with them. For example, it is  known that patents with Parkinson's disease have reduced levels  of dopamine in their brains, and NTT has confirmed that this  technique can detect dopamine.    In addition, because the structure of the system is simple,  by incorporating LSI technology NTT hopes to make the detector  compact and available at an affordable price so that it can be  used in many different fields.</p>

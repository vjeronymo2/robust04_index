			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / UK Company News: Doctus shares fall 8p on profit warning DOCTUS, the management, personnel and marketing consultancy, yesterday issued a profit warning and said it was reviewing the marketing element of its business - which was beefed up under two years ago through the Pounds 40m merger with Prospective Group. Doctus's share price fell 8p to 39p, compared with its 12-month high of 138p last May. The group also announced that the roles of chairman and chief executive were to be split. Mr Brian Blake would continue as chairman and Mr Alan Greenough, who joined the board last October, would take the latter post. A non-executive deputy chairman was also about to be appointed. Mr Blake, who said the management changes were not connected with the weaker performance, said the group's interim pre-tax profit to March 31 would be 'quite a bit below' last year's Pounds 4.1m. The Gulf war and downturn in the UK economy had led to 'a decision paralysis' and the cancellation of some orders. Trading had suffered particularly in January and February. For the full year brokers' forecasts of Pounds 10m-Pounds 12m (Pounds 11.4m) would not be met, although trade had picked up since the first half. The group was about to announce disposals that would reduce year-end debt of Pounds 25m. Its review of strategy included considering whether or not to keep the marketing activities, which accounted for 60 per cent of operating profit last year. Prospective, formerly known as Pineapple because of its roots in the eponymous dance studio, was mostly marketing orientated. Mr Blake said the decision to review this side of the business did not mean that Prospective - acquired for shares, but bringing in substantial debt - had been a bad buy. If parts were put up for sale, they would only go if the prices were right. Marketing's performance had been flat last year compared with more than doubled profit growth at the management and human resources consultancies.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Maher Chmaytelli] </F>   [Text] Aden, Yemen, June 24 (AFP) -- Four civilians were  killed and 32 people wounded Friday [24 June] as northern troops  kept up their blitz of Aden, advancing steadily through southern  defences.    Katyusha rockets slammed into the districts of Khur Maksar  close to Aden airport, Ma'allah near the port and Shaykh 'Uthman  in the northern suburbs, killing four people and wounding 28  others, hospital officials said.    In fierce fighting on the northwest front at B'ir Ahmad, 15  kilometres (nine miles) from Aden, four soldiers were wounded,  they added.    Northern troops, who have kept up a barrage of rockets and  artillery fire on the southern stronghold for more than a week,  advanced overnight into the town of Bi'r Ahmad after seizing the  entrance on Thursday, an AFP correspondent reported.    Fighting had died down earlier Friday but southern troops  were massing armoured cars to launch a counter-offensive on  their northern rivals loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih.    At least 113 civilians have now been killed and about 400  wounded since the north unleashed its assault on the city last  Thursday, according to a toll by hospital officials.    Thirty people, mostly civilians, were killed and close to  150  wounded on Thursday as rocket and artillery fire rained on the  city in the fiercest day of shelling so far.    In Aden residents still have to queue up at 72 wells for  water, even though southern authorities have managed to  reconnect supplies from the main pumping station at Bi'r Nasir,  close to the northern front, hit by northern fire several days  ago.    International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) officials  said water supplies were "vulnerable" to contamination.    They are helping the city authorities install proper pumps,  so residents do not throw plastic containers directly into the  water supply.    Both the ICRC and a spokeswoman for Medecins Sans Frontieres  said there were no signs of any epidemics breaking out in the  city.    By advancing from the northwest, northern troops are hoping  to cut off Aden from the power station in Hiswah, 10 kilometres  (six miles) from Aden and the oil refinery at Little Aden, 15  kilometres (nine miles) from the city.    Military sources said the south had inflicted heavy losses  on  northern troops at Bi'r Ahmad, where "a large number" had been  killed, 23 tanks destroyed and another seven captured.    The rival troops exchanged artillery fire on all fronts  round  the embattled city, but southern warplanes continued taking off  from the airport, despite the shelling.    A military spokesman in the city said two northern missiles  fired on "economic targets" were blown up by southern  anti-aircraft fire.    Meanwhile, southern leader 'Ali Salim al-Bid was holding  more  meetings with tribal leaders in a bid to get them to help repel  the northern forces.    On Thursday southern leaders pleaded for foreign  intervention  to break the tightening stranglehold on Aden.    They said the north was violating a UN ceasefire call  adopted  in a Security Council resolution on June 1.    Northern Planning Minister 'Abd-al Karim al-Iryani left  Sanaa  Thursday for New York, where he is to meet with UN Secretary  General Butrus Butrus-Ghali to discuss the situation in Aden.    UN special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi failed to broker a  ceasefire  in a 10-day tour of the region.    Four ceasefires have collapsed since the war erupted on May  5, shattering a four-year uneasy union between the former  tribal, conservative North Yemen and the Marxist South.</p>

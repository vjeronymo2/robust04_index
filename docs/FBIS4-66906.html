			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [KOMMERSANT correspondent Mikhail Kirtser report: "Russian </F> Cosmodrome: Plesetsk Will Take on Baykonur's Programs, if Money  Is Forthcoming"]    [Text] Yesterday KOMMERSANT correspondent Mikhail  Kirtser returned from Arkhangelsk province, where the Russia's  Plesetsk cosmodrome, which has for 30 years fulfilled  exclusively military functions and which is officially known as  a state test site, is located amidst the forests. For the first  time, the command of the Strategic Misile Forces permitted  Russian journalists to come here, showing them the latest Topol  (SS-25) strategic missiles as well as an excercise by a missile  regiment.    During the excercise the photojournalists simply implored  the  missile officers to erect an ICBM into the vertical position.  But the soldiers explained that such a procedure is  irreversible: A missile can assume combat position only with a  "launch" command. The press decided not to insist. They were  able to observe the movement of a column of missiles and support  vehicles and the concealment of a launcher at its combat site in  the forest. Then the KOMMERSANT correspondent visited the  training center, where noncoms and officers are trained as  service personnel.    The Plestesk cosmodrome is an entire complex of the most  various buildings and installations. The strategic mobile  missile regiment, whose excercise the representatives of the  press observed, is only a part of the whole. There are also  launch sites, which are inevitably associated with Baykonur,  which is now in a foreign country. True, they were not able to  look into missile silos--their hatches can be opened only by  means of a special mechanism (whose work would be "noticed" both  by the press and by orbital spy satellites), but they were  nonetheless able to touch a rail-based missile complex  (KOMMERSANT wrote about this adventure in February).    The true purpose of the invitation to the journalists became  clear at the concluding press conference, which was conducted at  the secret town of Mirnyy, next to the cosmodrome. The test  site commander, Lieutenant General Yuriy Zhuralev, declared that  he thought it was incorrect to divide the country's missile  forces into Strategic Missile Forces, military-space forces, and  ABM defense forces. In his opinion, such a division only  complicates command and control and increases upkeep expenses.  The lieutenant general also declared that the test site's  capabilities enable it, without no need for new equipment, not  only to support the Strategic Missile Forces' combat readiness,  but also to take on the civilian space programs from the  Baykonur cosmodrome (the more so, in that Mirnyy has scientific  establishments and intellectual potential which would permit  Russian space technology to attain a high level of efficiency  and reliablity). There is only one problem--too little money.</p>

			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Survey of Leicestershire 7: Families are tightly knit - Asian businessmen are looking to new markets THE ASIAN community and its involvement in Leicester's economy has grown rapidly in the last 20 years. Ethnic minorities now account for about 28 per cent of the city's population of 280,000. The dominant communities are Asian: Hindus who arrived from Uganda in the 1970s; Sikhs from the Punjab, and Moslems from Pakistan. Mr Bullu Patel is the development officer for ethnic communities in the 'City Challenge' area of Leicester. Formerly business development officer at the chamber of commerce, he thinks that it is nearly impossible to estimate the contribution made by Asian businesses to the city's economy. He says: 'So many employees are relatives - and therefore often not officially registered as workers. Asian businesses can be coy about output. As near as I can estimate there are 4000 ethnic - mostly Asian - businesses in Leicester.' These include many small corner shops: grocers, supermarkets, pharmacies, jewellers, clothes and dress shops. But significantly, Asians have also expanded into manufacturing, particularly textiles. In a sense, Asian businesses in Leicester have anticipated a national trend. Large, monolithic, footwear and garment manufacturers with predominantly male, heavily unionised, well-paid workforces, began to shrink or even to disappear during the 1980s, under the pressure of cheap foreign competition. They were replaced by some Asian manufacturers employing females, who are paid less well. One such is the Poshak group, which also trades as Water Rose. Poshak is run by Mr GS Bakshi, a Sikh, with his son Miti, who is 29, and Miti's cousin Ringo, 28. Other than a non-Asian accountant, there are no other directors or managers. There are 70 employees, many of them family. There are two silk-screen machines and an embroidery unit. The three Bakshis work from seven o'clock in the morning to eight or nine o'clock at night. Because most of the people sitting over the sewing machines are family members, there are flexible working arrangements over pay and conditions. Mr GS Bakshi declined to say what the wage rates were, but admitted that some workers were on piece rates. The company's success, however, depends only partly in controlling costs. Mr Miti Bakshi says: 'We came here from London in 1987. Everything is better value for money - wages, the buildings, raw materials.' But he adds: 'We cannot compete on cost. You could import a T-shirt from Hong Kong for 70p. The yarn alone would cost us that. The cheapest we could produce a bottom-of-the-range T-shirt is 150p. Where we compete is by being close to the ground and being flexible. Let me give you an example. We know our customers very well. They are wholesalers. If they import some garments which turn out not to be the right colour they often turn to us. We can supply them within three days.' Fast throughput is thus as important as cost. Mr Ringo Bakshi says the factory turns out 35,000 garments a week and that the factory is never without yarn. Asked whether the company has been affected by the recession, Mr Miti Bakshi says: 'No, what recession?' This may be true for Poshak, but Mr Bullu Patel says the downturn in retailing has caused other textile manufacturers to have a more difficult time. 'What some of them have done is to load up lorries full of garments, drive to places like Germany and sell to East Europeans.' The need to find new markets has led to the formation of a group called Asians Tackling Business, run by four second-generation Asian professionals. One of the directors, Mr Jitendra Patel, a solicitor, says: 'What the recession has done is make many businesses realise they must become more sophisticated. Banks who never bothered companies before now want quarterly statements. What we aim to do is convince Asians that they are not running just Asian businesses but businesses like anybody else.' Mr Ashwin Moody, another director, says a lot can be done in the area of marketing. He says: 'We are holding a range of seminars on the local economy, banking in Switzerland, importing and exporting, and dealing with local government and merchant banking.' Mr Bullu Patel says: 'Asian businessmen do not like control to go outside the family, so I do not see any Asian businesses growing into large country-wide concerns. But they will start up new businesses and spread into areas such as corporate image-making, marketing, financial services, in which Asians are currently not involved.'</p>

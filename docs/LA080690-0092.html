			<p><P> August 6, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OJAI;  </P> <P> BYPASS NOT LIKELY SOON, COUNCIL SAYS  </P> <P> Ojai officials, concerned about the traffic impact of a proposed 50-home  subdivision in Meiners Oaks, say the county should not take into account a  bypass that may not be completed for decades.  </P> <P> The county report calls for the developer, John Schuck of the Franciscan-Lowe  Ojai Venture, to contribute a "fair share" toward building a park-and-ride lot  along California 33 and toward construction of a new stretch of highway to  bypass Casitas Springs.  </P> <P> The Ojai City Council is asking why the bypass is being considered when  construction is many years away. Ojai Planning Director William Prince said the  city's response to the environmental report will be presented to the county by  Aug. 15.  </P> <P> "I question the adequacy of that bypass as a mitigation measure," Prince said.  "It would appear the county should revise the document."  </P> <P> Ron Allen, a planner with the Ventura County Planning Division, said that both  the time and cost involved to make the road improvements could be prohibitive  to the developer, depending on how much he is required to contribute.  </P> <P> A one-acre parking lot for 175 vehicles, the report says, would cost $250,000  to build after $500,000 is spent to acquire the land, at current market value.  </P> <P> Building a Casitas bypass -- a new segment of California 33 proposed from  Foster Park to Arnaz Grade south of Oak View -- is estimated to cost at least  $24 million.  </P> <P> "The bypass is not really a viable alternative," Allen said. "Caltrans has not  put it on its five-year list of projects and state funds for it appear to be  nonexistent. It's at least 10 or 20 years away."  </P> <P> Allen said the Board of Supervisors must decide which measures will be required  of the developer before the project is approved. "If he can't fulfill those  decisions, then there's no way he can build," Allen said.  </P> <P> Schuck's attorneys are also reviewing the environmental report, a company  spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> The county's Environmental Report Review Committee will hold a public hearing  on it Aug. 22 in the County Government Center.

			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FRANCE SURPRISES U.S. IN DUNHILL CUP  </P> <P> Defending champion United States was eliminated 2 1/2- 1/2 in the first round  of the Dunhill Cup by France today, adding another bitter souvenir of a  European trip for American golfers.  </P> <P> Also out was second-seeded Australia, with its top two players -- PGA Tour  money leader Greg Norman and PGA champion Wayne Grady -- losing to New Zealand.  </P> <P> The unseeded French team of Marc Farry, Jean Van de Velde and Emmanuel Dussart  led from the very first hole of the medal-match play series to beat U.S.  golfing millionaires Mark Calcavecchia, Curtis Strange and Tom Kite.  </P> <P> Only a double-bogey 6 by Van de Velde on the 17th -- the notorious Road Hole --  enabled Strange to tie him for the lone American points.  </P> <P> It was the second straight year that France started the team event with a major  upset. France beat second-seeded Australia in the opening round a year ago. It  also was the first time since the initial Dunhill Cup in 1985 that the United  States had been a first-round loser.  </P> <P> Farry, with a blue ski cap pulled tight against the cold, damp weather, beat  Calcavecchia, the 1989 British Open champion, 70-73.  </P> <P> "There was no luck involved. He just beat me," Calcavecchia said. "Their whole  team played well, it looks like, and we didn't play at all."  </P> <P> Van de Velde led two-time U.S. Open winner Strange by two strokes when he hit  his second shot into a bunker at No. 17, then missed a 4-foot putt. He and  Strange tied at 69-69.  </P> <P> "I'm not saying a thing," Strange snapped at reporters who tried to find out  what happened.  </P> <P> Dussart, whose third-place tie in this year's Tenerife Open was the best career  showing for any of the French trio, then clinched the upset victory when he  nailed a downhill 6-foot bogey putt on the 18th to seal a 73-74 victory over  Kite, the leading money winner in golf history..  </P> <P> "I am elated," Dussart said.  </P> <P> France plays eighth-seeded Japan in the second round. Last year's runners-up  beat Argentina, 2-1.  </P> <P> Norman lost to New Zealand's Frank Nobilo, a journeyman on the European tour,  67-76. Norman collapsed on the back nine with three bogeys and a double-bogey 6  at the Road Hole.  </P> <P> Grady also had back-nine problems, including a quadruple-bogey 9 at No. 14 that  turned a two-shot lead into a two-shot deficit. The PGA champ needed four shots  to get out of a bunker there, then took a double-bogey 6 at the 16th to lose to  Simon Owen, 74-78.  </P> <P> Rodger Davis got the lone Australian win, 66-75 over Greg Turner.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO RESIDENTS ASKED TO CUT WATER USE AFTER AQUEDUCT BREAK  </P> <P> Several hundred thousand residents in southeast San Diego County were  admonished Saturday to reduce water consumption by at least half -- and in some  neighborhoods to brace for intermittent water stoppages -- because of a break  in one of the five main aqueducts that bring imported water here.  </P> <P> Three water districts that serve suburban cities and rural neighborhoods  declared a Stage 4 water emergency, meaning that outdoor watering and car  washing are banned and customers are urged to cut back on water use indoors.  </P> <P> Water officials also were turning off meters that serve crop irrigation lines  and construction sites.  </P> <P> The break in the aqueduct occurred Friday. Officials said the rupture of the  84-inch aqueduct -- which normally pours 70 million gallons of water daily into  the area -- might not be repaired until next Friday. Workers were awaiting a  replacement 20-foot steel pipe section being fabricated in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "Once it's delivered, we'll work around the clock to get it in," said Lester  Snow, general manager of the San Diego County Water Authority, which sells  wholesale water to the county's individual public water districts.  </P> <P> He said cause of the break in the reinforced concrete pipe, in the Scripps  Ranch area of San Diego, was still unknown Saturday.  </P> <P> He said lessons are being learned from the incident: just how well San Diego  might fare if an earthquake ruptured one or more of the five pipelines that  bring imported water into San Diego from Northern California.  </P> <P> "This is a good illustration of what we'd have to do if we had an earthquake --  by asking the public to immediately reduce its water consumption and by asking  the various water agencies to share their water through inter-connections," he  said.  </P> <P> Among those affected by the waterline break were residents of the cities of  Santee, El Cajon, La Mesa and Lemon Grove, and the unincorporated communities  of Rancho San Diego, Spring Valley, Lakeside, Alpine and Otay along the  U.S.-Mexican border.  </P> <P> Within the city of San Diego, only residents in the northern suburb of Rancho  Bernardo might experience a drop in water pressure, Snow said.  </P> <P> Although Snow said there should be no serious water shortages if customers cut  back on water and the affected agencies are able to buy water from neighboring  districts -- as they were doing Saturday -- other water officials still made  dire pronouncements.  </P> <P> "We're at a Stage 4 alert," said Leslie Melenchuk, spokesperson for the Padre  Dam Municipal Water District. "And there is no Stage 5. This is as bad as it  gets."  </P> <P> Said Charlie Cassens, spokesman for the Otay Water District, the hardest hit:  "We have enough water in our storage tanks to keep us until Wednesday, but we  could run out of water, unless we get every customer to cut back to only the  most essential water use.  </P> <P> "There may be some areas in our district that will experience lower water  pressure, and there is the possibility of intermittent interruptions in our  water service as we do some creative 'valving' to keep our reservoirs from  going dry."  </P> <P> Efforts were under way Saturday to purchase water from other districts. Still,  sitting literally at the end of the water pipeline from Northern California to  the Mexican border, the Otay district officials said they weren't bluffing when  asking customers to cut back.  </P> <P> "We're trying to get the word out to everybody that this is no drill or the  result of the drought or any political maneuvering," Cassens said. "This is an  actual, physical break in a main artery that brings imported water to San Diego  County. This is most certainly an example of what could happen to the region in  an earthquake."  </P> <P> Cassens said enforcement officers were patrolling the district to look for  water-wasting scofflaws, and he asked residents to take action if they see  people not responding to the call for strict conservation.  </P></p>

			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Don't take unit trust yields at face value - Investors should be cautious over higher returns Newly-launched income unit trusts have been taking advantage of a technical rule change allowing them to publish higher yields than before. Earlier this year, the Securities and Investments Board (SIB) - the chief financial services regulator - decided that fund management groups could take their annual management fee out of investors' capital instead of income, which can boost yield figures by up to 50 per cent. Save &amp; Prosper launched an Extra Income unit trust, with an initial yield of 6.25 per cent, earlier this month while Mercury Income Portfolio was launched last month with an initial gross yield of 5.25 per cent. Both groups have taken full advantage of the SIB change, which adds up to 1.5 percentage points to the yield figures they could otherwise have shown. The change affects unit trusts aiming mainly for income, or emphasising income and capital growth equally. Unit trusts are being told to disclose the method of charging fees against capital, noting clearly that this could impair future capital growth. Existing unit-holders are entitled to three months' notice of a change of charging method. Management groups are divided over whether existing unit trusts should convert to the new treatment, pointing to possible tax disadvantages for investors as well as managers. The main catch is for higher-rate taxpayers who may not want the higher yield. They will find themselves paying 40 per cent on the excess income unless they move to a different, lower-yielding fund. Although most managers claim there is little possibility of investors being confused or misled, some are nervous about the appearance in close proximity of figures established on different bases, and stress that total return is what counts. They urge investors to probe beyond headline yield figures to find exactly how returns are being achieved. Peter Edwards, of Premier Unit Trust Brokers in Bristol, thinks most unit trust groups eventually will join the charge-to-capital club, whatever their present attitudes. 'It's a very competitive world - they will see this as something they have probably got to do.' The danger of charging fees to capital is that it might be eroded or future growth constrained, but Edwards believes ordinary investors are not concerned with the allocation of management fees. 'People don't honestly give a hoot about this. Most people just want that dividend cheque.' S&amp;P is expecting Extra Income to pull in more than Pounds 50m in its initial offer period. S&amp;P's literature notes that ' . . . it is likely that some or all of the annual management fee will be charged to the fund as capital.' Julian Tregoning, director of investment products at S&amp;P and chairman of the Association of Unit and Investment Funds, says this is merely the required form of words. In practice, the full 1.5 per cent will be charged to capital. He says S&amp;P might alter some of its existing income funds so that only part of the management fee is set against capital. 'It will depend on the income requirements. We want to make sure we maintain income.' Management groups with income funds at the top end of the performance tables are taking a cautious approach to the rule change. Peter Reeve, managing director of Jupiter Tyndall Merlin, says he and the trustees have decided against any immediate alteration to the group's income fund. This is the top performer in the UK equity income sector over five, three, two and one years to August 1 (source: HSW, offer-to-bid, net income re-invested). Reeve says: 'We shall have to see how our nearest competitors in the performance tables deal with this. We are not rushing into anything.' At GT Unit Managers, also a consistent high performer, managing director Martin Harrison says the new charging method will not be adopted for the existing income fund. But the group might well launch a new unit trust using it, given the very strong demand for income. Perpetual does not plan any immediate changes. Marketing director Roger Cornick explains: 'We are not rushing to tell investors we can possibly squeeze a drop or two of extra income. I think groups with the greatest need for improved yield figures will probably make use of the relaxed rules most quickly.' M&amp;G also is making no changes. Communications manager Rachel Medill points out: 'By taking charges from capital, you get a high yield - but you are no better off in total return terms.' She was vague, however, on whether this would be long-term policy for M&amp;G, saying the pressures of competitive life made a definite forecast difficult. Schroder is to write to the 14,500 holders of its Pounds 128m Income fund in November telling them that the fund will begin taking its 1 per cent annual charge out of capital next February. This will lift the yield by 28 per cent, from 3.6 to 4.6 per cent. Unit-holders who object will be offered a free switch into another of the group's funds. According to Bridget Cleverly, assistant director of marketing, the group thinks the change will be tax-neutral. 'It will make our income fund much more attractive for people looking for income not total return,' she says. Schroder also is considering a similar move involving its gilt and fixed interest trust and global bond fund. Both Fidelity and Gartmore have decided against altering any of their existing funds at present. But at Prolific, which has yet to decide, marketing director Mike Webb says there is a very sound investment reason for charging fees to capital. It is, he explains, easier for the fund manager to achieve a yield by investing in companies lower down the yield curve than is possible when fees come out of income. This means the fund manager is able to buy shares with better prospects for long-term capital growth.</p>

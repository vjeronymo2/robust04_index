			<p><P> November 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'BLUE PLANET' AT IMAX . . . UP CLOSE AND DISTANT;  </P> <P> FILMED FROM A SPACE SHUTTLE, THE STARTLING VIEWS OF EARTH CONVEY IDEAS AS  POWERFUL AS THEIR IMAGES.  </P> <P> Movies are not only art and entertainment; they're also technology. And the  technology behind the latest IMAX film, "Blue Planet" (at the Mitsubishi IMAX  Theater in Exposition Park) is so extraordinary, its impact so overwhelming,  that it may knock most audiences breathless. Fortunately, "Planet" has ideas as  potent as its images.  </P> <P> The technical breakthroughs of Cinerama and CinemaScope pale before the  showpiece shot of "Blue Planet." Taken 330 miles above the Caribbean, through  the huge pillars of a space shuttle, it reveals the vast blue ball of Earth,  flecked with pearly, swirling clouds, in dizzying sharp focus far, far below  us. This is a deep-focus shot that might have made Orson Welles drool, one that  irresistibly recalls the visionary force of Stanley Kubrick's "2001." On the  vast IMAX screen -- 8 stories high and 70 feet wide -- it becomes overpowering.  </P> <P> No more so, though, than many other shots in the movie: some from the Serengeti  plains and Namib deserts of Africa, the volcanic mountains of Hawaii, the  streets of Paris, San Francisco and Tokyo. The whole plan of "Planet" is to  show us the Earth in macrocosm and microcosm, to give us the staggering  totality and then zero in on both the particular and the effects: earthquakes,  glacial and climatic shifts, the fairyland topography of the clouds, lightning  leaping between them.  </P> <P> Not surprisingly, the theme that binds it all together, thanks to writer-editor  Toni Myers, is ecological. And the implicit call for greater environmental  conservation and planning doesn't feel forced on the material. Given what we  see about what is happening to the planet, it's inevitable.  </P> <P> From above, it sometimes seems as if war or awful pestilence were gnawing away  at us. Whole sections of the Earth in decay or erosion -- in ravenously  deforested Madagascar, where the hills, barren, red and muddy, slide into the  sea; in Brazil, where the rain forest is vanishing at the rate of acres a day.  Most disturbingly, we see the effects of this rampaging erosion and pollution.  Astronaut James Buchli comments somberly over a side view of the ozone layer --  all that protects the world's plethora of life from the airlessness and death  of outer space: "Not very big, is it?"  </P> <P> The distant eye gives us a sobering picture. Our stewardship of Earth and its  resources begins to seem reckless, chaotic and wildly self-destructive.  </P> <P> This melancholy theme ties together the spectacular views. Beyond the  travelogues which have often been the forte of IMAX, "Blue Planet" becomes a  plea for a rational stewardship of our world -- and a deep-focus hymn to its  beauty and variety. It doesn't go too far -- less perhaps because, ironically  enough, one of its principal sponsors was the Lockheed Corp., than because of  the sheer magnitude of the logistics involved. But the images eloquently speak  for themselves.  </P> <P> "Blue Planet," will alternate with two other excellent IMAX movies, "Chronos"  and "Grand Canyon." Many of its makers -- Myers, producer Graeme Ferguson,  principal director Ben Burtt, principal cinematographer David Douglas (assisted  by, among others, space shuttle astronauts) -- are old IMAX hands. It's clear  that in this film they're trying to outdo themselves. And have.  </P> <P> If you've never seen an IMAX film -- and parents should be advised that "Blue  Planet" (Times rated: family) is not only eminently suitable for children, but  one that youngsters probably should see -- this is almost certainly the one  with which to begin.

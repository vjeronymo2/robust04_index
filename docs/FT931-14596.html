			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Court boost for Italian electoral reform plans REFORM of Italy's unwieldy electoral system will be accelerated following an historic decision by the constitutional court over the weekend. On Saturday the court sanctioned 10 referendums on various aspects of reforming the state. The most important concerns the proposed abolition of the 45-year-old system of proportional representation for electing the senate and local councils in favour of a first-past-the-post system. The main drawback of Italy's existing electoral system is the way it encourages the fragmentation of parties and produces unstable coalition governments. The referendums must now be held between April 18 and June 13. They can be postponed only if parliament agrees in the meantime legislation similar in spirit to that contained in the 10 proposals. In any event, new legislation changing the electoral system is almost certain in the first half of the year. A 60-strong commission of the two houses of parliament has been discussing institutional reform, especially changes in the electoral system, since October. But it has been bogged down by a lack of consensus among the main parties. The ruling Christian Democrats and Socialists in particular have opposed the removal of proportional representation. Political commentators said yesterday that unless the parties made an effort to achieve a consensus, parliament would be unable to agree on new legislation in time to head off the referendums. They also predicted that the referendums would be easily carried. The last referendum, held in June 1991 to abolish the system of multi-preference votes, was overwhelmingly endorsed. 'Italians finally have in their hands the means to build a new republic,' said a jubilant Mr Mario Segni, the Christian Democrat leader of the movement backing reform of the electoral system via referendum. Mr Segni has been co-opted onto the joint parliamentary institutional reform commission and will now becomes a key member. The issue of the referendum is also likely to affect the nature of new alliances as the Christian Democrats struggle to renew themselves and the Socialists seek to stay together after the eclipse of Mr Bettino Craxi, their leader, in the Milan corruption scandal. Both party leaderships have been wary of the referendum movement and have been anxious to control change through parliament. Under the new system proposed for elections to the Senate, 238 seats would be elected by a first-past-the-post system and 77 would still be voted in by the existing system of proportional representation. Mr Segni hopes a similar approach could be agreed for the chamber of deputies.</p>

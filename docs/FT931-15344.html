			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / The world tries to end horror of poison gas: More than 100 nations have agreed to sign, but the ban on chemical weapons could go further MORE THAN 90 years of efforts to eradicate poison gases as instruments of war culminate in a treaty being signed in Paris over the next three days. The first signatures will be put this afternoon to a convention outlawing the use, manufacture, storage and transfer of chemical arms. Under the Chemical Weapons Convention stockpiles and production facilities will be destroyed, and procedures set up to verify compliance and monitor production of chemicals that could potentially be used for weapons. By Friday it is expected that foreign ministers or their representatives from well over 100 countries will have signed. But the high profile given to the occasion cannot disguise the treaty's compromise nature. Officials in the UK, which sought tougher policing of the ban, admitted it would not provide a final answer to proliferation of chemical weapons. 'There are no final answers in this business,' they added. It will be at least 10 years before the world gets rid of stockpiles reckoned to include about 5m chemical munitions, and the convention will leave important gaps, at least initially. Most Arab governments are expected to boycott the Paris ceremony. Egypt, hosting an Arab League meeting on Monday, said there was a unanimous decision not to sign. It and other Arab nations have made their assent conditional on Israel's joining the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty; chemical weapons are seen as providing a counterweight to Israeli nuclear weapons. The US and other western governments hope Arab countries will eventually join. But this may have to await the outcome of the Middle East peace process. North Korea, another suspected possessor of chemical arms, is also expected to stay out of the treaty. The watering-down of verification rules is seen as another weakness. In 1984, then US Vice-President George Bush proposed a draft treaty subject to inspection 'any time, anywhere'. But in the later stages of negotiation the US took a very different stance, worried that the treaty might be used to pry into other secret military installations. The final text allows a country up to five days to negotiate terms before opening a site to inspectors. The treaty will not take effect until early 1995, assuming that at least 65 countries have ratified it by the middle of next year. However, western officials believe it will create a significant impediment to would-be proliferators. It will reinforce the controls which industrialised countries in the so-called Australia Group have been exercising over chemical exports, and provides for the destruction of all declared production facilities - including, most importantly, Russia's. The US and the then Soviet Union agreed in 1990 to stop making chemical weapons and scrap most of their holdings. The US is now discussing assistance to help Russia with the Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.5bn) cost of destroying its 40,000-tonne stockpile. A number of countries alleged to possess chemical weapons are expected to join the treaty. These include Iran, Israel, China, India and Pakistan. The treaty caps 24 years of negotiation on a global ban, undertaken for the last 12 of those years in an ad hoc committee of the UN's 39-nation Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. The impetus for concluding this notoriously tedious process came from the ending of the cold war, the flagrant use of chemicals during the Iran-Iraq war and the threatened use by Iraq in the 1991 Gulf conflict. Although Iraq will not be a signatory, destruction and inspection of its extensive facilities is being undertaken separately under UN resolutions. Early last year the talks appeared in danger of losing momentum if not completed quickly. Working from an Australian draft, negotiations were declared closed in August. A subsequent resolution supporting the treaty at the UN General Assembly was co-sponsored by 144 nations. It has taken the international community 67 years to extend the ban on the use of chemical weapons - the Geneva Protocol - to outlawing the weapons themselves. The only precedent for an outright ban of this kind is the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention, but that failed to provide for verification. Verification, including challenge inspections without right of refusal, brought up the greatest problems in the talks, and occupies much of the 192-page document. Mr Ronald Lehman, director of the US Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, argues that it is 'the most intrusive inspection regime ever established in an arms control agreement'. UK officials say that despite the compromises it should deter 'all but the most determined evaders'. An Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons is to be set up in The Hague to oversee compliance. Each signatory will also have to set up an authority to deal with chemical producers and incoming inspections. Dr Tamar Posner, an expert at the UK Chemical Industries Association, estimates that preparation and training for inspections could cost producers Pounds 90,000 per inspection.</p>

			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Food and Drink: Capital eats in Paris - Nicholas Lander enjoys three memorable meals in a day IT IS not easy to recommend restaurants in Paris as everyone seems to have a favourite. But, with the pound at such a low exchange rate against the franc, here are three distinctive restaurants that may make any trip to that delightful city no less expensive but more memorable: Breakfast. Cafe Le Flore, 172, Boulevard St-Germain. Opposite Brassserie Lipp and next to Les Deux Magots, an other famous Parisian cafe, Le Flore has been second home to many famous literary figures, Huysmans, Sartre and de Beauvoir. Its croissants and pains au chocolat are excellent; the coffee and hot chocolate are strong and dark and the red banquettes offer comfort and discretion. The waiters are suitably discreet, too. I sat and felt much aggrieved as, on the next table, a middle-aged man introduced his much younger fiancee to the waiter, also a Nicholas, rather than to me. Any table near the entrance of the cafe's small kitchen offers the chance to overhear the waiters' barked orders - 'un cafe, deux espress' and, even at 9am, 'deux bieres' - because the waiters, as in so many cafes, do not bother with order pads. Lunch. Chez Georges, 1 Rue du Mail, tel 42 60 07 11. A restaurant that offers the definitively bourgeois cooking of the Lyonnais area. It is near Place des Victoires in the 2nd arrondissement. You should lunch there for those very French dishes - rillettes of pork, fromage de tete, coq au vin or blanquette de veaux - and, also, for those unforgettable French restaurant sights such as a table occupied by one woman, wrapped in a fur coat with a poodle at her feet, happily moving through a large, bloody steak, a bottle of red wine and a packet of cigarettes. Chez Georges, too, for a unique style of service. Le patron, dressed in a chef's jacket, greets you although he handles nothing more than than a credit card processing machine which sounds the only discordant note in a busy room where the decor does not seem to have changed for 50 years. He then hands you over to one of half a dozen waitresses who are comforting, swift on their feet and in control. As I walked past the entrance to the kitchen I overheard one waitress telling the chef, firmly, that when she cooked kidneys at home, she cooked them in quite a different manner. Fish included an escalope of salmon with sorrel, fillet of turbot with chanterelles mushrooms and noodles and sea bass with a beurre blanc. The house speciality was profiteroles filled with ice cream and a hot chocolate sauce. Cheeses are excellent. Across the road is one of Paris's oldest, and most picturesque, patisseries, Au Panetier. Cost is Pounds 25-Pounds 30 per head as long as you stick to their good cru Beaujolais served in pitchers. Dinner. L'Ami Louis, 32 Rue de Vertbois, tel 48 87 77 48. This restaurant which, in its 60 years, has been owned by the original Louis, then Antoine and now by a younger Louis, manages to do things I have seen nowhere else in the world. Your coats are taken and thrown on to a shelf that runs down both sides of the dining room (the gap between the two lines of tables is exactly the width of Louis's shoulders) the descent to the lavatories in the basement the steepest I have ever navigated (do not let go of the rope handle) on the dining tables napkins almost the size of tablecloths are provided and French bread, sliced horizontally and grilled is borne to your table as a six-inch tall edifice, only outdone by the frites which arrive, in the shape of a bee-hive. All the cooking is done on an ancient, wood fired range. When I was introduced to the chef as a former restaurateur the only question he asked was whether my stoves were wood-fired. He walked off in disgust when I told him they were gas. There is no concession whatsoever to vegetarians. The only accompaniments to the massive plates of food are a simple green salad and watercress for a garnish. L'Ami Louis is run on three principles. Firstly, it buys only the best ingredients irrespective of cost. Then it cooks them simply and serves them with unflinching generosity. My roast chicken, cooked with as much butter as chicken, was moist and delicious. Snails and slabs of foie gras were large, and the potato cake that arrived smothered in garlic underneath the confit of duck was unforgettable, particularly as I had to steal it, morsel by morsel, from my friend's plate. Louis's customers respond to this generosity by ordering magnums of red from a newly-improved wine list. Dinner costs approximately Pounds 60 per head.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, 16 May (MENA) -- The European Union [EU]  has praised Egypt's role in supporting the Middle East peace  process despite difficulties and sacrifices.    The EU stressed that efforts in this regard, from the Madrid  conference, through the Israeli-Palestinian Declaration of  Principles signed on 13 September, to the signing of the  Gaza-Jericho Agreement in Cairo on 4 May, owe much to Egypt's  constructive and positive contribution and reflect Egypt's  consistent and principled policy.    This came in a joint statement issued after the ninth  meeting  of the Egyptian-European Cooperation Council held in Brussels  today and chaired by Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa and Greek  Alternate Foreign Affairs Minister Theodhoros Pangalos, whose  country chairs the EU Council.    The statement said that today's meeting allowed the two  sides  to take stock of their relations within the framework of their  cooperation agreement. It also provided a chance to discuss  political issues of mutual concern.    The EU saluted Egypt's pioneering role in achieving peace in  the Middle East, describing that role as a strong factor  creating stability and balance in the region.    The two sides recalled the joint action of the EU foreign  ministers on 19 April to support the Middle East peace process  and mobilize the EU's political, economic, and financial  resources to achieve a just and comprehensive settlement in the  Middle East.    The two sides highlighted their joint efforts to help  achieve  greater success in the negotiations between Israel and the PLO  and make progress on the other bilateral negotiating tracks  involving Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan on the basis of the  relevant UN Security Council resolutions and the principles of  the Madrid conference, including the exchange of land for peace.    The statement said the role of both sides in the  multilateral  talks emphasizes the commitment of Egypt and the EU to play an  active and constructive role in the peace process.    The two sides agreed on the need for a more active role by  the committees of the multilateral talks.    The two sides stressed that making progress on all the  bilateral and multilateral tracks of the Middle East peace  negotiations will achieve development and regional cooperation  in the region, from which both sides will benefit.    The two sides noted the need for peace and security in the  Mediterranean region. The statement said the two sides aspire  to rapid efforts to achieve these common interests out of their  belief that this would help create regional peace and security.    Within the framework of bilateral cooperation, the EU noted  with great interest that Egypt is firmly committed to continuing  to implement the economic reform program.    The joint statement said the private investment sector and  the export sector represent the basic factor in the success of  the Egyptian economic reform program.    The statement also stressed that the Egyptian Government's  current policies of liberalizing trade, reforming the structures  of public establishments, and privatization will inevitably  reduce the budget deficit and increase investment.    The statement said the private sector is the center of  economic development in Egypt and should be encouraged to make  the required and appropriate initiatives in this regard.    The statement pointed out the EU contribution to achieving a  series of important programs in Egypt, especially through  financial protocols. It also pointed out the EU's approval of  Egypt's programs of privatization and reform of public sector  establishments with a view to helping Egypt complete its  economic process.    The EU stressed its support for Egypt's efforts to  liberalize  its trade and reduce its tariff abroad.    The EU expressed support for Egypt's request to increase its  exports to the EU market so as to redress the trade balance  deficit.    In response to the offer by the European side, Egypt  expressed willingness to start exploratory talks with the EU  soon on a new partnership agreement covering every area of  cooperation.    The two sides welcomed the initiative to discover new forms  of cooperation between them in accordance with a new agreement  reflecting all the aspects of their special relations.    The joint statement said the European side will report to  the  council on the results of those talks and make appropriate  proposals.</p>

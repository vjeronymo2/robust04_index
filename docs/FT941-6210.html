			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / International Company News: Turnround for Thai telephone concessionaire TelecomAsia, the Thai telephone concessionaire that became the largest capitalised company of the Stock Exchange of Thailand when its shares were traded publicly for the first time last December, has reported net profit for 1993 of Bt564.7m (Dollars 22.3m), below projected earnings of Bt878m, but a strong turnround from 1992's loss of Bt41.1m, writes William Barnes in Bangkok. The company, a subsidiary of the Charoen Pokphand group, is likely to report sharp swings in profits because it will only get a significant income from its business of supplying and operating 2m telephone lines in Bangkok after several years.</p>

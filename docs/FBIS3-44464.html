			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with economist Wu Jinglian by staff reporter Lin </F> Chen (2651 2525); place and date not given: "Take Great Care  Not To Let the Reform Go Out of Shape"]    [Text] The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee made the decision to push ahead with the reform in a  comprehensive way. The promulgation of the "50 Articles,"  dubbed as a "program for action in the reform of the economic  structure in the nineties," signals that China's reform has  entered the stage of tackling key issues. At this moment, how  to continue summing up the positive and negative experiences in  the past 15 years of reform provides a mirror for the full-scale  advancement of the reform in the next stage, and making a good  job of the first step in tackling the key issues has become very  important. With this thought in mind, this reporter interviewed  Chinese economist Wu Jinglian.    [Lin Chen] As an economist, you have all along had a part in  the whole process of China's economic structural reform and in  the formulation of many major reform proposals. What is your  comment on the reform in the past 15 years?    [Wu Jinglian] China's reform has made progress in many  important fields. In particular, the gradual establishment of  the target model of building a socialist market economy is a  great theoretical achievement. However, one should also  recognize that reform is still relatively lagging behind in many  key areas. For instance, though we have made quite some efforts  in the reform of state-owned enterprises, we have failed to  achieve any real breakthrough; in the development of the market  system, the building of commodity markets has been advancing at  a fast pace, but the building of such production elements  markets as the money market and labor market is lagging behind  by comparison. Because of the slow- moving reform in key  sectors, some important social and economic problems are hard to  resolve properly. For example, the three biggest issues,  namely, inflation, corruption, and unfair distribution of wealth  in society, are still bothering us to this day. In short, in  terms of reform, things that are easy to do are almost all done,  and what are left are the more difficult things. Therefore, in  my opinion, the reform is entering the stage of tackling key  issues in the next phase. The great significance of the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee is that it  issued the order to start storming difficult problems.    [Lin] In that case, what do you think we should pay  attention to in the operation to storm difficult problems?    [Wu] The "Decision" of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th  CPC Central Committee gives a clear and detailed outline of the  reform to be carried out in the revenue and taxation, monetary,  investment, and exchange systems. The question now is how to  make sure that these proposals do not go out of shape or change  flavor in the course of implementation. Sometimes, a good  reform proposal turns out to be nothing like what was expected  once it is put into practice. In this respect, we have a lot of  experience to draw lessons from.    [Lin] There are many reasons why a reform goes out of shape.  It might be connected to some problem of understanding,  operational problems, or motivation by interests.    [Wu] I agree. First and foremost is the problem with  understanding and the second is the problem with interests. The  latter deserves special attention. For instance, some people  often interpret new things in the context of market economy from  a point of view that carries the hallmark of the planned  economy. The "Decision" of the Third Plenary Session of the  14th CPC Central Committee points out: "The purpose of  establishing a system of socialist market economy is to let the  market function as the foundation of resource disposition under  the macroregulation and control of the state." If, according to  the nature of market economy, macroregulation and control is  correctly interpreted as regulation and control over total  supply and demand (such as total monetary supply and demand),  this would be a correct notion. The problem is that some people  have now expanded the definition of macroregulation and control  and put everything that the state considers important and  necessary to control in the category of macroregulation and  control. This is like putting the role of the market into the  bag of the government's administrative control. In fact, this  is a misunderstanding. Macroregulation and control is inherent  in the notion of market economy. All developed nations with  market economy exercise control over total supply and demand.  This is called macroregulation and control. But one should not  draw a parallel between micro administrative intervention and  macroregulation and control. In order to prevent the reform  from going out of shape, it is necessary to change the incorrect  way of thinking that rejects the government's role once market  policy is implemented and, whenever macroregulation and control  is emphasized, puts everything under government control.    There is another opinion, which goes to the other extreme.  Whenever market regulation is encouraged, they will think that  as long as there is a market, whatever the quality, it will be  able to dispose of resources in the most efficient way; or even  think that a speculation-dominated market can play the same  role. Therefore, the end results of some reforms, which started  in the right direction, are not as desired. Take the  batch-leasing of land for example. This is a reform in line with  the market orientation. However, batch-leasing of land in a  market economy must be conducted in accordance with strict  market procedures and rules. But we omitted the second part  when employing this means. In other words, the administration  made all the decisions on the leasing and the rates of lease.  As a result, some people have made big fortunes by using  administrative powers and the otherwise fine market means has  become a hotbed of corruption.    [Lin] Speaking of this, people tend to blame this problem  on land batch-leasing as a market means and rarely consider the  mistakes we made when using this means. It seems that when the  reform goes out of shape, not only the people's interests are  harmed, but the reputation of reform is undermined.    [Wu] That is true. To change this situation, we all face  the need for restudy. Just as Comrade Jiang Zemin said, we must  acquire the knowledge of market economy. In the meantime, the  guiding role of the propaganda media is also very important. It  is not good to describe market building as either too easy or  too simple. Spreading specious viewpoints will exert a more  negative impact. Now people are vying with each other to run  futures markets, believing that they are "big fish." In fact,  futures trading involves extremely big risks, because it is  commodity trading based on expected prices. To use a common  expression, futures trading means carrying out a commodity deal  in relation to which the delivery will not be executed until a  certain point in the future, and the risk lies in the projection  of the price at the time of delivery. Therefore, one may say  that the function of futures is to help the producer and the  trader avoid risks, so that large-scale economic activities can  go ahead. Naturally, however, this requires interaction between  the speculators and the parties trying to avoid risks. In this  context, speculation does have a positive role. However, it is  very wrong to think that pure speculation is also positive and  therefore encourage speculation unconditionally. Pure  speculation is no different from gambling. It is either you  lose, I gain or the other way round. It does not create  material wealth. On the contrary, excessive speculation has a  destructive function. I feel that for some time in the past, the  way we described futures was not comprehensive enough and was  sometimes even misleading. This has caused some of those  involved in it to overlook the risks they should bear while  looking forward eagerly to making a fortune. As a result, the  country rushed headlong into setting up futures markets, sowing  the seeds of crisis from the very beginning. Some law-breaking  businessmen from abroad made big fortunes while the people and  the state suffered great losses.    [Lin] The "Decision" of the Third Plenary Session of the  14th CPC Central Committee places the reform of state-owned  enterprises in a very important position and sets goals for  establishing a modern enterprise system. What is your comment  on this, Mr. Wu?    [Wu] In the reform of large and medium-sized state  enterprises, two concepts have now been accepted by most people.  One is that a modern enterprise system must be established; the  other is that company-oriented transformation must be conducted.  Recognizing this point may be considered a major breakthrough in  the understanding of enterprise reform. In my opinion, what is  called the modern enterprise system is actually the modern  corporate system: They are one and the same. But some  theoretical issues and policy issues regarding how to transform  our country's state-owned enterprises into modern companies have  not yet been completely solved. How to understand public  ownership as the predominant sector, what concrete forms public  ownership should take, who shall represent state property  rights, and how to embody the leading role of the Communist  Party in the general manager responsibility system under the  leadership of the chairman of the board -- all these issues  should be conscientiously tackled. Only by so doing can we  truly establish a modern enterprise system.    [Lin] In the process of reform in the past, we have  experimented with many methods, such as the economic accounting  system, factory director responsibility system, economic  responsibility system, enterprise contract system, and the  ongoing implementation of the "Regulations" for converting  operational mechanisms. All these efforts can be regarded as  endeavors to build up a system.    [Wu] The establishment of a modern enterprise system which  has now been proposed has a clear objective, namely, the  establishment of a modern corporate system. Only by  establishing such an organizational system can we truly realize  the goal of transforming the enterprise operational mechanism.  In that case, we must be clear about what a modern corporate  system is, or else the reform may still go out of shape. In my  opinion, a modern company has two features: One, the company  has a legal person status. It uses its corporate property as  the basis for exercising its civil rights and uses its corporate  property to undertake various obligations stipulated by the  civil law. Two, in terms of management system, the company  should establish one that incorporates three parties, namely,  the shareholder general meeting, the board of directors, and the  general manager, which check on one another. In this way,  operational experts will be fully authorized to run the company,  while the ownership is under ultimate restraint. The owner  delegates the management power to the board of directors, which  decides on broad policies and supervises the general manager and  other executives. The general manager takes overall  responsibility for the executive organ. These three tiers form  a relationship of mutual balance.    [Lin] In that case, what is your comment on the existing  joint-stock enterprises?    [Wu] There are now over 3,000 joint-stock enterprises that  are in the experimental stage in China. Through years of  exploration, we have gained a lot of experience. But we should  also be aware that most experimental companies still have a long  way to go to meet international norms. Many localities have  been setting up joint- stock companies not for the purpose of  changing the system, but in order to raise money or even to make  money through speculative share deals. This is the wrong way to  go. Therefore, we should follow the requirements of the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and "rectify  in accordance with the requirements of the norms" the existing  companies. Naturally, however, the precondition for doing this  job well is to get the essential point straight and have a clear  understanding of what a modern corporate system is.</p>

			<p><P> July 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NICOLAS GUILLEN, 87; KNOWN AS CUBA'S 'NATIONAL POET'  </P> <P> Nicolas Guillen, the Cuban poet who melded the dialect and speech patterns of  Cuban blacks with African folklore and rhythms into a movement called poesia  negra (black poetry), making him one of Latin America's best-known writers,  died Sunday.  </P> <P> The official Mexican news agency Notimex, quoting the Cuban news agency Prensa  Latina, said Monday he had died in Havana at age 87.  </P> <P> Guillen, who came to be known as Cuba's "national poet" after the 1959  revolution led by Fidel Castro, had suffered from advanced arteriosclerosis and  Parkinson's disease. He had a leg amputated last month.  </P> <P> Guillen was the mulatto son of a journalist who was first attracted to poetry  by a 1930 visit to Cuba by black American poet Langston Hughes.  </P> <P> Hughes' leadership of the so-called Harlem Renaissance inspired Guillen's first  successful verse collection, "Motivos de Son" ("Motifs of Sound.") The eight  poems were structured like popular Cuban songs and dances interspersed with  African elements.  </P> <P> He became the first to give voice to the squalor that was the black slums of  Havana.  </P> <P> Guillen's work came to celebrate Cuba's multiracial and ethnic mix as well as  the communist revolution that brought Castro to power. For more than 25 years  he was director of Cuba's Union of Writers and Artists.  </P> <P> "It is necessary to have a clear-cut attitude. My poetry is a dynamic process.  . . . It constantly supports and encourages the struggles of peoples against  inequality and imperialism," he once said.  </P> <P> Prensa Latina said word of his death sent a shock wave through Cuba's people,  many of whom know his verses by heart.  </P> <P> Many of them -- which exalt popular leaders while indicting foreign control --  have been translated into scores of languages.  </P> <P> In the prologue to a book of what he called "mulatto" poetry, Guillen said: "In  these verses perhaps enter the same elements that enter into the ethnic  composition of Cuba, where we all are mestizos. . . . One day they will say:  'Cuban color.' These poems anticipate this day."  </P> <P> The passage was quoted by Prensa Latina in the dispatch monitored in Mexico.  </P> <P> Guillen became a communist in 1937 and went to Spain to fight on the Loyalist  side against the military uprising of Gen. Francisco Franco in the Spanish  Civil War. He became well-known for his emotional readings of poetry to  Loyalist troops.  </P> <P> After the Spanish republic was crushed by Franco in 1939, Guillen returned to  Cuba as an active communist and outspoken writer on political and social  grievances. He was arrested several times by the government of Cuban leader  Fulgencio Batista in the 1950s.  </P> <P> From 1945 to 1948, Guillen had traveled in South America. Recollections of the  trip were included in works published in Buenos Aires.  </P> <P> When Guillen tried to return from a trip to Chile in 1953, Batista refused to  let him into the country and he began a five-year exile.  </P> <P> Castro's triumph brought Guillen back to his homeland where he became the poet  laureate of the revolution. His 1964 verse "Tengo" ("I Have") praises the  rebels, depicts Batista's flight and celebrates the Cuban victory over the  American forces in the Bay of Pigs invasion.  </P> <P> His "El Gran Zoo" ("The Great Zoo") taunts imperialism while musing on love,  nature and the mystery of life itself.  </P> <P> His "La Paloma de Vuelo Popular" ("The Dove of Popular Flight") includes  elegies and is considered a masterpiece of the Spanish poetic genre.  </P> <P> Guillen had been a member of the Communist Party's Central Committee in Cuba  but he had retired from political activity.  </P> <P> A prolific writer until his health failed, he was asked on his 70th birthday  which of his poems he personally preferred.  </P> <P> "Those I still haven't written," he answered.  </P> <P> Prensa Latina said Guillen's body would lie in state in the Plaza of the  Revolution in Havana and that a public funeral will be held today.  </P></p>

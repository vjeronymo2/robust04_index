			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Markets: A fine time to land in a fix - Serious Money FIXED-RATE mortgages are now extremely attractive for potential house buyers, according to financial adviser Berry Birch &amp; Noble - and it is hard to disagree. Even though most experts seem to expect a base rate reduction before, or around the time of, the chancellor's Budget in November, the variable mortgage rate is unlikely to reflect that cut in full. A one percentage point cut in base rates might lead to a reduction of only a half, or a quarter, point for mortgages. As Mike Beerling, Berry Birch &amp; Noble's mortgage director, explains: 'Mortgage interest rates cannot fall much more. Any further drop in UK interest rates will give building societies very little scope to reduce mortgage interest rates as the societies need to maintain competitive rates to attract savers.' Borrowers appear to be listening to such advice. According to the Council of Mortgage Lenders, just under half of the mortgages and re-mortgages taken out in the first quarter of 1993 had a fixed rate of interest. Since an increase in interest rates seems a threat more in the medium than the short term, it is probably better to lock in to a mortgage with a longer period, even though the rates normally are higher. Halifax's present range of fixed rates, for example, varies from 6.75 per cent (APR 8.3 per cent) until November 30 1995, to 8.75 per cent (APR 9.1 per cent) until November 30 2003. The Halifax is also offering a series of 'stepped' mortgages, with a low rate until November 30 1994 and then a higher rate over the rest of the term. For existing customers, the rates are: 6.5 per cent, then 6.75 per cent till November 30, 1995 (APR 8.3 per cent); 6.95 per cent, then 7.45 per cent until May 31, 1997 (APR 8.3 per cent); and 7.2 per cent, then 7.95 per cent until November 30, 1998 (APR 8.5 per cent). Arrangement fees vary from Pounds 150 to Pounds 250 and redemption fees from three to five months' interest, depending on the term of the loan. First-time buyers must take out buildings and contents insurance or a mortgage payment protector policy from the society; however, they benefit from a lower rate in the initial period. Northern Rock building society is offering a 6.89 per cent fix (APR 7.3 per cent) until August 1 1997. The arrangement fee is Pounds 275 and borrowers must take out home and contents insurance. These rates may not be the absolute lowest that fixed-rate mortgages will ever reach but they are probably pretty close to the bottom. If you are about to take out a mortgage, in historical terms, you are very lucky to have the chance to fix at present rates. CAPITAL SHARES were designed to do extremely well in a bull market and they have certainly been up to the task this year. According to SG Warburg, the average capital share rose 65 per cent between January 1 and August 20, compared with a 15 per cent total return from the FT-A All-Share index over the same period. Split capital investment trusts issue capital shares to attract investors who want a geared stock market return. The rights of capital shares vary from trust to trust. In a simple trust, there will be two classes of shares: income (which get all the revenue) and capital (which get no income, but all the growth). More complex issues throw in zeros (which pay no income, but get steady capital growth) or stepped preference shares (which earn steady income and capital growth). The key fact to grasp is that capital shares are at the end of the queue. All the other shareholders get paid off first. Only if the trust's assets grow significantly will the capital shareholders earn a decent return. But once that target is passed, capital shareholders normally get all the growth and the returns start to look really attractive. As an example, Warburg cites River Plate capital shares. If you assume the trust's assets can grow at 5 per cent a year, the gross redemption yield to capital shareholders (at the August 20 price) will be 18.3 per cent. And River Plate capital shares have already risen by more than 150 per cent this year. Of course, such high rewards as these do not come without their risks. When the market and trust assets fall, the price of capital shares drops even faster as the prospects of a good payout recedes. Warburg says: 'Shorter-term investors may want to consider taking some profits, as we believe that the UK market is at or near its peak for the current year and there is a genuine risk of some consolidation.' It adds, however: 'On a longer-term view, we still believe that certain capital shares represent very good value and are capable of generating outperformance against the markets.' For those who believe the present bull market has plenty of mileage left in it, and who are willing to accept a high level of risk to their capital, the Warburg-recommended capital shares are: Fulcrum, Gartmore Scotland, General Consolidated, M &amp; G Income, River &amp; Mercantile, River Plate, St David's and Yeoman. But be warned: these shares are definitely not for the cautious, for those who cannot afford to lose any part of their capital, or for those who want income.</p>

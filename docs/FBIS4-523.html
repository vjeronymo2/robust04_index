			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  THE CITIZEN </H8>   Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English on 11 April in its  page-6  editorial urges the four summit leaders, President de Klerk, ANC  President Nelson Mandela, Zulu King Zwelithini, and Inkatha  Freedom Party (IFP) leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi respectively, to  "rethink" their positions on kwaZulu/Natal "with greater  urgency." "Mr Mandela wants a further meeting with the king,  but he will have to offer more than he has suggested so far. As  for Chief Buthelezi, he should know that an ANC-dominated  government intends to finish him off after the election when  kwaZulu will no longer exist as an entity." Buthelezi should  "rather take part, even at this 11th hour, in the poll than have  to fight a post-election battle from a weakened position. The  situation is a mess -- a bloody mess -- and nobody has the  ability or determination to rescue kwaZulu/Natal from it."  <H8>  THE STAR </H8>   TEC Increase of Police Allowances Prudent -- "The  anticipated  decision by the TEC [Transitional Executive Council] to nearly  treble the daily allowance paid to policemen during the election  period is prudent rather than profligate," notes a page-12  editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 12 April.  "Policemen, frequently abused as 'oppressors' by radicals, are  if anything exposed to greater dangers than members of the  Defence Force and Peacekeeping Force. Glaring disparities in  salaries cannot be justified." THE STAR also notes that Nelson  Mandela has "begun to urge the public to co-operate with the  SADF [South African Defense Force] and the SAP [South African  Police]. He includes the SAP when he praises the security  forces." THE STAR believes that rogue policemen should be  removed, but that "the SAP as a whole deserves more than abuse  and inadequate pay-cheques."  <H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>   ANC `Indifferent' to Flight of Investment Capital --  Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY warns in a page-10 editorial on 12  April that the collapse of the financial and commercial rands  "was not a temporary occurrence that can safely be ignored."  "Television images of tanks rumbling into Natal's kraals and of  Zulu royalists being shot dead outside Shell House help  underscore the world's belief that we are drifting towards civil  war. While that impression remains, the outward flight of  foreign and South African investment capital will not abate."  Meanwhile, "the ANC, our next ruling party, is distracted by  its drive to annihilate its political opponents and is  apparently indifferent to the likely effects of its current  actions and promises on South Africa's long-term economic  health. Vague affirmations of economic rectitude are no longer  adequate. If the past weeks' damage to investor confidence is  to be repaired, unequivocal commitments are needed to economic  and political policies that investors find comfortable."</p>

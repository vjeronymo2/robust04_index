			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Results of the Session of the </F> Presidium of the Belarusian Supreme Soviet"]    [Excerpts] Myacheslaw Hryb chaired the 18 May session of  the Presidium of the Belarusian Supreme Soviet. The session  participants discussed the issue of the implementation of a law  on languages. Nil Hilevich, chairman of the legislative  commission for education, culture, and preservation of historic  heritage, delivered a report. He substantiated the setting up  of an office within the Cabinet of Ministers to pursue a unified  language policy in the Republic, and expediting the drafting of  legal acts -- aimed at implementing the "Law on Languages in the  Republic of Belarus" -- by state bodies subordinated to the  government. At the proposal of Myacheslaw Hryb, a decision to  set up a working commission, headed by Deputy Supreme Soviet  Chairman Ivan Bambiza, to work out a resolution on this issue  considering remarks and proposals by members of the presidium  was adopted.    According to Vyachaslaw Kuznyatsow, first deputy Supreme  Soviet chairman, the following resolutions were adopted: "On  Rough Plan Regarding Draft Laws and Other Issues To Be Discussed  by the Belarusian Supreme Soviet Deputies in 1994 and Beyond"  and "On Schedule for Designing Draft Laws for the 15th Session  of the 12th Belarusian Supreme Soviet." These documents charge  the Cabinet of Ministers and other initiators with drafting and  forwarding legislative acts for discussion by the Consultative  Council and the Presidium of the Belarusian Supreme Soviet under  established conditions. More than 130 legislative acts should  be discussed (60 of them -- at the 15th Supreme Soviet session)  and some 20 international pacts and agreements should be  ratified by the end of 1994.    To honor the memory of the victims of the war and fascist  genocide, and in connection with the 50th anniversary of  Belarus' liberation and victory in the Great Patriotic War  [World War II], a resolution to set up a memorial on the  territory of the former death camp "Trastsyanets" was adopted.  In connection with this resolution, the government should draft  corresponding legislative acts. In addition, a range of  ministries and departments were charged with making documents  accessible in Belarusian and foreign (based on international  agreements) archives on the former death camp "Trastsyanets,"  which operated in 1942-44, permitting research, publishing, and  film production.    Members of the Presidium of the Belarusian Supreme Soviet  heard a report by the Control Chamber of the Republic of Belarus  on developments in 1993. According to Control Chamber Chairman  Vasil Sakovich, a resolution "On Establishing a Council --  Within the Cabinet of Ministers -- for Coordinating Operations  of Control Bodies Conducting Financial-Economic Control of the  National Economy" was adopted. V. Sakovich was nominated  chairman of this council. It was agreed that this body will  include, in particular, a minister for administration of state  property and privatization, a director of the Department of  Economic Control within the Cabinet of Ministers, a chairman of  the State Chief Inspection of Taxation, and a deputy chairman of  the Belarusian National Bank. The issue on measures regarding  strengthening of material and technical supply, development of  the social sphere of the Control Chamber of Belarus, and  incentives for its employees was also discussed. The Commission  for Planning, Budget, and Finances, along with the established  council, was charged with drafting proposals concerning the  strengthening of the social sphere of all control bodies of the  Republic, and the development of incentives for its employees.    The Presidium of the Belarusian Supreme Soviet adopted a  resolution "On Issuing Credits." This resolution, in  particular, charges the Belarusian National Bank with issuing a  line of credit of 100 billion rubles [R] -- at the expense of  the National Bank profits from the first quarter of 1994 --  under the conditions postulated by clause No. 15 of the "Law on  the 1994 State Budget of the Republic of Belarus." Commercial  banks were recommended to issue a credit line of R400 billion to  the government in May-June. In addition, the National Bank was  charged with drafting a special procedure for using economic  norms regarding commercial banks issuing the aforementioned  credits. When discussing this issue, it was noted that  enterprises, organizations, and institutions of the budget  sector require these credits for making payments to their  employees. [passage omitted]    Two posts -- that of domestic policy adviser, and press  secretary to the Supreme Soviet chairman -- were introduced to  the Supreme Soviet secretary staff.</p>

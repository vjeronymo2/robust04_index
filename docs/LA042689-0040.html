			<p><P> April 26, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NBC WANTS TO MOVE INTO PROPOSED BURBANK HIGH-RISE  </P> <P> NBC plans to create a new West Coast headquarters by consolidating many of its  operations in a high-rise complex proposed for the Burbank Media District.  </P> <P> The network announced Tuesday it has agreed to occupy at least one-eighth of an  800,000 square-foot, $200-million complex of offices, shops and restaurants to  be called NBC Plaza. The site is a 4.2-acre triangular parcel bounded by Olive  Avenue, California Street and the Ventura Freeway just west of NBC's present  home, network officials said.  </P> <P> NBC said it will form a joint venture with the developer, Cushman Investment  and Development Corp., which has built or is building several million square  feet of office space in Burbank, Pasadena and Long Beach.  </P> <P> Cushman originally proposed the Media District complex in August, 1987. But  concerns of city officials and neighborhood groups over rapid construction in  the area delayed the project until a specific plan to control district growth  could be written. The plan -- and the project -- are pending before the  Planning Board and then would have to be approved by the Burbank City Council.  </P> <P> Cushman had proposed building two office towers, one 23 stories and one 16  stories. John E. O'Neill, NBC's vice president for real estate, said the joint  venture will propose two towers no taller than that, but final plans have not  been completed. Between 1 1/2 and 2 acres will be a landscaped open plaza, he  said.  </P> <P> Cushman owns or holds options on the proposed site, which is occupied by two  motels and smaller buildings along Olive Avenue. The site is buffered from  residential areas by other commercial areas.  </P> <P> Larry Kosmont, a consultant to the joint venture, said it would take about 60  days to complete designing the project and have it reviewed by city officials  and neighborhood organizations.  </P> <P> "One thing that Cushman and NBC are in complete agreement on is . . . the  sensitivity of the community with regard to height, traffic, parking and so  on," O'Neill said. "This will be neighborhood-friendly. It is not our intent to  in any way alienate the community."  </P> <P> NBC officials said employees who occupy leased office space in North Hollywood  and elsewhere in Burbank would move to the new headquarters upon completion. If  approved on schedule, company officials said, construction could begin in late  1990 and end about two years later.  </P> <P> The network operates nine production studios and a number of administrative and  other buildings on the adjacent 48-acre site where it relocated from Hollywood  in 1952. Those buildings would continue to be used. NBC has 1,600 full-time  employees in Burbank.  </P> <P> Newly elected Burbank City Councilman Tom Flavin, who as a Planning Board  member has pushed for development of the Media District specific plan, said he  had not seen details of the proposal.  </P> <P> "I still think the Media District plan needs some work," he said. "I would like  to have all of those matters resolved before we take any major action on  development."  </P> <P> Flavin said the Media District specific plan as written would allow buildings  as tall as 22 stories in the south part of the district and 25 stories on  studio property. He said he would prefer a 15-story height limit.  </P> <P> Burbank City Manager Bud Ovrom said he was "extremely pleased" with NBC's  commitment to a continued presence in the city.  </P> <P> "As to the specifics of the buildings," he said, "we'll have to work with them  closely on the details" to respond to neighborhood concerns.  </P> <P> More than 2 million square feet of office space, including the soon-to-be  completed 32-story Geiger Building, have been built during the past five years  in areas next to the proposed project.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> $2.7-MILLION GRANT TARGETS YOUNGSTERS  </P> <P> The children of Logan Heights and Barrio Logan will be the beneficiaries of a  $2.7-million grant awarded Tuesday by the U.S. Department of Labor.  </P> <P> The three-year grant to the San Diego Consortium &amp; Private Industry Council  will be used to create a neighborhood program to help youths finish school,  find summer jobs and provide alternatives to gang activities, according to  Aurelia Koby, chief executive officer of the consortium.  </P> <P> The county group is a joint public and private organization charged by the  federal government with training and placing low-income youth, adults and  laid-off workers in jobs. The group includes representatives from the San Diego  City Council, the County Board of Supervisors and 22 leaders from private  industry and education.  </P> <P> "The mayor was delighted with the news," said Paul Downey, spokesman for Mayor  Maureen O'Connor. "This is something she has been working on and lobbying in  Washington for over a year and a half.  </P> <P> The grant proposal, begun in 1989 when the mayor declared the Year of the  Child, was developed with the advice of 39 public and private organizations who  will implement the Youth Opportunities Unlimited program, according to  consortium officials.  </P> <P> The proposal was also based on visits by O'Connor, Councilman Wes Pratt and  others to model programs in San Francisco, New York City, Cleveland and Denver.  </P> <P> The program will be housed at the William J. Oakes Boys and Girls Club near  Memorial Junior High and provide services to as many as 1,000 children in its  first year, said Hank Killmar, executive vice president of First Interstate  Bank and chairman of the Youth Opportunities task force.  </P></p>

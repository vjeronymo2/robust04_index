			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Recovery eludes Danes despite surplus DENMARK achieved a record DKr14.1bn (Pounds 1.27bn) surplus on the current balance of payments in 1991, up from DKr8.1bn in 1990, which was the first surplus for 27 years, writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen. The 1991 surplus included a DKr51.5bn surplus on the balance of trade in goods and services, about 6 per cent of the gross domestic product. The country's strong external account and its low, 2.5 per cent inflation rate are, however, associated with other less satisfactory developments. Unemployment is higher than ever at a seasonally-adjusted 10.9 per cent in December, while an expected recovery in growth last year failed to emerge. Revised official GDP estimates for the first three quarters of 1991 indicate an increase in real GDP of only about 0.2 per cent from the same period in 1990. The government expected a growth rate of about 1.7 per cent as recently as December.</p>

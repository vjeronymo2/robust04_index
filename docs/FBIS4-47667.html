			<p>BFN     [Text] Members of the broad-based National Union and Public  Salvation Government met today at the weekly cabinet meeting,  which was chaired by Prime Minister Faustin Ririndwa. Here is a  report on the cabinet session, read by government spokesman  N'gongo Luwowo, minister of communication and press.    [Begin Luwowo recording] Under the chairmanship of His  Excellency Mr. Faustin Birindwa, the prime minister and head of  government, the members of the transitional executive met today,  29 April, at the Hotel du Conseil, for their weekly meeting.  The following items were examined:    1. The state of the nation.    2. The situation within the High Council of the Republic-  Transitional Parliament [HCR-PT].    3. The situation in Rwanda.    Moving to examine the first item, government members were  informed about an increasingly greater influx of Rwandan and  foreign refugees moving towards Zaire, who were searching for a  haven of peace and tranquility. Goma in North Kivu and all the  border towns with Rwanda are particularly affected by this  influx of people -- men, women, and children -- completely in  disarray and fleeing the atrocities which the various rival  Rwandan factions are engaged in.    Today's cabinet meeting also examined the unfortunate  incidents which took place on the night of 26 April in  Mbanza-Ngungu in Bas-Zaire, during which undisciplined men in  uniform engaged in certain reprehensible acts. The cold storage  facilities of some shops in Manza-Ngungu were looted of their  contents.    After rapidly bringing these undisciplined soldiers under  control, the military hierarchy -- immediately after bringing  the situation under control -- dispatched to Mbanza-Ngungu the  chief of staff of the Army, the deputy chief of staff of the  National Gendarmerie, and an intelligence officer from the  General Chief of Staff Headquarters. All these officers were  charged with conducting a thorough investigation into the  authors behind these incidents.    The same team is charged with determining the level of  responsibility of all those involved, before sending them to a  military tribunal for exemplary and appropriate punishment. In  this regard, the Government of the Republic wants to strongly  denounce the misinformation campaign recently launched by some  politicians who, it says, have intentionally spread lies and  false rumors, with the aim of inciting our uniformed countrymen  to engage in actions that run counter to military duty and  discipline.    The minister in charge of relations with the HCR-PT briefed  the government team on an unfortunate incident which took place  yesterday at the People's Palace, where a group of parliamentary  members belonging to the Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition  and allies [USOR], prevented the plenary session of the  transitional legislative organ from taking place. Shouting,  whistling, chanting songs, and making a great amount of noise in  the room, these transitional parliamentarians, some of which  wore sporting outfits, pushed their irresponsibility to the  point of tearing the attendance form to pieces on two occasions.    There is every indication that the parliamentarians had  planned this action -- they do not seem to grasp the magnitude  of the nobility of their mission and the importance of the great  task they shoulder. At a time when a serious economic and  political crisis is hitting the country, the Zairian people have  a right to expect different behavior from the assemblymen, and a  different attitude within this transitional institution.    In every respectable parliament other methods and language  exist that are better fitted to situations which may crop up.  Also, there are other means of expressing one's opinions within  a parliamentary house. Until the contrary is proven, whistling,  chants, and the attitudes demonstrated yesterday at the People's  Palace, are not what the sovereign people of our country expect  of their representatives.    The search for solutions to the ills plaguing Zaire calls  for  a display of a minimum amount of tolerance, civility, and  courtesy to those who do not share the same ideas.    In conclusion, the executive members of the Transition  Executive deliberated on the prevailing situation in neighboring  Rwanda -- a brotherly, friendly country. The Government of the  Republic is keenly following developments in Kigali, as well as  in other towns and communities in Rwanda, and bitterly deplores  the undescribable horrors and massacres perpetrated with  impunity by armed political and military factions.    The government also deplores the unexplainable indifference  shown by the international community, which seems to have opted  to turn its back on the immense Rwandan tragedy, while under  other skies huge resources have been deployed to reduce  prevailing tensions and to extinguish the fires of conflict.    The Republic of Zaire calls on all peace and justice loving  countries to coordinate their efforts to bring Rwandans back to  understanding, concord, and peace. Zaire asks all the nations  of the world to use every means at their disposal to persuade  the Rwandan brothers to turn their backs on the dark path of war  and tread back on the bright path of dialogue and discussion,  which is the token of a just and lasting peace.    The meeting started at 1000 and ended at 1500. Thank you.  [end recording]</p>

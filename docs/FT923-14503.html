			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Gulf separates KIO from its former glory: Peter Bruce outlines the problems of Kuwait's international investment arm The Kuwait Investment Office (KIO) had a reputation as a powerful, secretive and astute investor until the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Now, as it struggles to solve the problems of Ercros, its loss-making Spanish chemicals company, it is also suffering from poor morale at its London headquarters and a rapidly shrinking portfolio. KIO sources inside and outside the group say that, since the invasion in August 1990, its worldwide investment portfolio has shrunk by more than 50 per cent - it once stood at about Dollars 100bn (Pounds 52bn) - as the KIO has been forced to help to cover the costs of the war. At one stage shortly after the war, the KIO was actually paying most of the salaries in the Kuwaiti government. Employees are concerned that KIO's reputation as a quick, aggressive investor is fast being bled away under a new management that is promoting inexperienced Kuwaitis over long-serving UK staff at its London headquarters. British employees were earlier this year paid lower bonuses for their efforts during the Gulf war than their Kuwaiti colleagues. Mr Ali Raschid al-Bader, the new president, a banker with long experience of the highly bureaucratic state sector in Kuwait, will not discuss group strategy. He bewildered the City earlier this year, however, by selling most of the KIO's 10.3 per cent stake in Midland Bank after Hongkong and Shanghai Bank first bid for it. 'The takeover could not have happened without KIO's consent,' says a former KIO official. 'They could have made up to Dollars 60m more had they waited.' The KIO had accumulated immense international influence by the time of the invasion. It once held more than 20 per cent of BP, though it was forced to cut this back. In addition to Midland in the UK, it had big holdings in Hogg Robinson, Henry Ansbacher and Triplex Lloyd. It has big holdings in Daimler-Benz, Metallgesellschaft, Hoechst, Fiat and Paribas. It was in Spain with a young Catalan banker, Mr Javier de la Rosa, that KIO made its single biggest economic impact. Its Spanish assets, built up since 1984, are worth between Dollars 3bn and Dollars 7bn. It owns Spain's biggest chemicals company, Ercros, its biggest paper producer, Torras Papel, its richest foods group, Ebro, and controls one of its largest property companies, Prima. The future of all of those businesses has now been thrown into doubt by KIO's decision last week to force Ercros - with 10,500 employees and debts of Dollars 2.5bn - to seek protection from its creditors. Mr de la Rosa has severed his links with KIO and its Spanish holding company, Torras, and the new management at KIO, knowing little about Spain, may have ruffled years of carefully constructed financial relationships by refusing to pump more money into Ercros and forcing its bankers to go to the courts for their money. The banks are angry and, with the Spanish economy in deep trouble, so is the government. Ercros's problems stem from its ruinous fertiliser businesses, which have failed to fight off a dramatic rise in imports in the last two years. Some of the blame lies with a former president who incorporated the state's fertiliser company into Ercros in 1990 but never followed through with a rationalisation programme. By the time the Iraqis invaded Kuwait, it was too late for KIO to take the necessary action. Kuwait was lobbying for Spanish support for the liberation of its territory and could not sack thousands of Spanish workers at the same time. 'In a way', says one former KIO official, 'while we paid for US, French and UK support for the war with cash, we paid Spain by employing people we did not need at Ercros.' Ercros may be a symptom of a deeper malaise at KIO. The new management views its Spanish portfolio as an ugly inheritance. Technically, as Torras claims to own only 39 per cent of Ercros, KIO is only an investor and not liable for its debts. That fits neatly with the KIO's new view that its global vocation is as a more passive investor, but it raises questions about the future of its other Spanish companies. Its treatment of Ercros - some of whose creditors will have their loans guaranteed by the state or by Torras - has depressed shares of Ebro and Prima. Banco Santander, heavily exposed to Torras, is said to be pressing for guarantees of repayment. 'If the KIO starts running down its Spanish businesses in public it will become a self-fulfilling prophecy,' says a Madrid analyst. 'It will become impossible to sell off Ercros without a massive injection of funds.' KIO's problem is that it is the public face of Kuwait in international capital markets, and its credibility as a borrower may be at stake in Ercros. It administers a Dollars 5.5bn loan to help rebuild Kuwait. Torras also has a convertible bond, worth some Dollars 100m outstanding which, if banks come to view the Ercros filing as a default, could be threatened. 'Ercros will definitely reflect on their credibility in the markets,' says an analyst in Madrid. This year Kuwait will earn about Dollars 3bn from oil, while its budget for 1992 is worth Dollars 15bn. The deficit will have to be financed by borrowing or disposals by KIO, which does not admit that it is selling assets and has never recognised the scale of disposals it has had to make since the war. 'Our problem is that we have imported Kuwait into London headquarters', says a former KIO official, 'and the office is much more bureaucratic and not able to deal quickly the way it used to. The effects of the Ercros decision may show that perceptions are much more important than the legality of what we are doing.'</p>

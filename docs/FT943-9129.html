			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Severn Trent in urgent review of dangerous chemicals storage Severn Trent Water is to carry out an urgent review of the storage of hazardous chemicals near rivers following a pollution incident earlier this year. The review is one of 28 recommendations in a report commissioned by Severn Trent after organic chemicals entered the River Severn after their discharge into a sewer in Shropshire. Up to 120,000 homes in the Worcester area were unable to use tap water for more than two days in April. Severn Trent has paid out nearly Pounds 1m compensation to residents who had to queue at water tankers. The report, by Professor Ken Ives, identifies 'serious weaknesses' in the system at the time of the incident. As criminal proceedings are pending, the report contains no findings or recommendations concerning the origin of the pollution. The discharge passed undetected through a sewage treatment works at Wem and entered the Severn through two small tributaries. Four days later consumers started complaining of an unpleasant taste. It took 16 hours from the first complaint to trace the alleged source. Prof Ives calls for improved detection procedures. He says it is 'a matter of great concern' that such odourless chemicals could pass through a sewage treatment works and be discharged into an important supply river. The report adds that the response to complaints was rapid and efficient although some sections of the public, particularly the elderly and those living alone, were not alerted quickly enough. Although the spill was not life-threatening, the report says the incident has highlighted the urgent need for a national review of the system of licensing the storage of chemicals, especially near vulnerable water courses. The report calls on Severn Trent and the National Rivers Authority to establish a database of potential sources of river pollution and calls for closer collaboration between the water service companies and the NRA over river pollution incidents. Mr Victor Cocker, Severn Trent managing director, said all recommendations would be acted on, and some had already been implemented.</p>

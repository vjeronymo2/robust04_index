			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Glaxo still confident of Zantac UNDERPINNING Glaxo's continuing success over the last year has been its ability to continue to expand Zantac, its ulcer treatment and the first medicine to break the Pounds 2bn sales barrier. In spite of the scale of the drug's sales, underlying growth, excluding exchange rates, increased by 11 per cent, a performance described by Dr Richard Sykes, chief executive, as quite remarkable. Dr Sykes said Glaxo's long-established position in the US with bulk purchasers of medicines had enabled Zantac's underlying growth from that source to reach 13 per cent in the year to June 30. Although underlying sales in Europe were up only 6 per cent - healthcare reforms in Germany and Italy cut sales by 10 per cent and 5 per cent respectively - those in the rest of the world increased by 19 per cent. Considerable attention had been paid to the recent challenge to Zantac's patents by US generic companies, said Dr Sykes. However, even if Glaxo lost the cases, no generic version would be on the market before 1996. There were other issues which could affect Zantac before the patents issue was resolved, Dr Sykes admitted. The most immediate threat was presented by the expiry next year of the patents of SmithKline Beecham's Tagamet, Zantac's main US competitor. Zantac would have to compete with generic versions of this drug. Even SmithKline Beecham's senior executives are divided over the likely impact. The main threat from generics would appear to be in the managed care sector, rather than the retail sector where patients pay for their own medicines and are used to taking Zantac. In the managed sector, Dr Sykes said Zantac was already holding its own against low-price Tagamet. Concerns about the safety and efficacy of generic versions could hold back their sales, he added. Even if Glaxo wins its patent case, generics companies will theoretically be able to market an earlier version of the drug from 1996. However, Dr Sykes played down the threat. There were regulatory problems for generics manufacturers because the earlier version had not previously been licensed. In addition, it was unstable and difficult to manufacture. Dr Sykes admitted that Zantac's sales would be affected by the introduction of over-the-counter non-prescription versions of Tagamet and Pepcid, Merck's counterpart. An FDA advisory committee met yesterday to discuss SmithKline Beecham's application. However, any impact would be marginal. Other threats include the eradication of helicobacter pylori, a bacterium which has recently been discovered to be implicated in ulcers. If doctors decided to eradicate the bug rather than prescribe Zantac type drugs, the market could collapse. Dr Sykes said this issue had still to be resolved and the company was working on its own eradication therapy. The company is planning applications for new illnesses, such as ulcers generated by anti-arthritic drugs, and new slow-release formulations. Dr Sykes insisted that in spite of the all the threats, Zantac's franchise had a positive future. Meanwhile, Glaxo has also launched a number of new products in an effort to reduce the dependence on Zantac. The new drugs, Serevent, Flixonase and Flixotide, the asthma treatments, Zofran, the anti-nausea treatment, Imigran, the migraine drug, Lacipil, a heart drug, and Cutivate, a skin cream, generated sales of Pounds 592m. Dr Sykes said the performance of the new drugs was very creditable given that Serevent and Flixotide were only now going on sale and that Imigran had only just been launched in the US and had already achieved sales of Pounds 116m (Pounds 43m). The star new drug, said Dr Sykes, had been Zofran which had generated revenues of Pounds 365m after only three years on the market. The treatment was not yet available in Japan, but he hoped it would be given approval during the fiscal year.</p>

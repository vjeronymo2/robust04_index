			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Daf wins order for return of trucks LEYLAND DAF, the truck company in administrative receivership, yesterday won a High Court order for the return to Britain of 210 unsold trucks that were shipped to the Netherlands over the Easter holiday without its knowledge. Contractors Edcrest and GM de Rooy, its Dutch parent company, which are in dispute with Leyland Daf over unpaid bills, moved the trucks, worth about Pounds 4m, from a compound at Leyland Daf's plant in Lancashire to de Rooy's base near Eindhoven. At the request of Leyland Daf's joint administrative receivers Mr Justice Millett made a mandatory order for the return of the trucks to England within five days. Edcrest argued it had a right to retain the vehicles until the settling of its claim against the company for between Pounds 3m and Pounds 4m in debts incurred before Leyland Daf's collapse. In February an agreement was reached, pending a full court hearing of the dispute, which allowed Leyland Daf access to trucks and vans stored by Edcrest so that it could continue to trade, on the understanding that it kept a minimum of 260 trucks and 200 vans in the Edcrest compounds as security. Leyland Daf has received an Pounds 8.2m order for 206 trucks from British Telecom. The trucks will come from Daf's plants at Leyland, Lancashire, and the Netherlands. Daf's demise, Page 10</p>

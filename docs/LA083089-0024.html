			<p><P> August 30, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ESTROGEN RISK  </P> <P> Thank you for your excellent coverage on the increased risk of breast cancer  with estrogen (Aug. 2). The study in the New England Journal of Medicine on  which you based your report is one of several that suggest this association.  Fortunately, newer therapies are being developed that in the future will avoid  the risk of cancer and will prevent osteoporosis. UCLA is conducting a study  using a nasal spray medication called calcitonin that prevents osteoporosis and  has none of the side effects of estrogen.  </P> <P> Hopefully in the future women will be protected against osteoporosis without  incurring other risks.  </P> <P> Dr. MARIA GREENWALD  </P> <P> Research Associate  </P> <P> Wadsworth V.A. Hospital  </P></p>

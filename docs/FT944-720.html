			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Insurance repayment ordered Farmers, the US insurance group owned by BAT Industries of the UK, was ordered by California's insurance commissioner yesterday to repay Dollars 183m (Pounds 117m) of premiums to policyholders under the state's controversial Proposition 103 law. The 1988 law, which required insurers to roll back premiums and pay rebates to Californian holders of car and other insurance policies, was recently upheld by the state's supreme court, in spite of opposition from the US insurance industry. The Farmers directive comes a month after Mr John Garamendi, the Californian insurance commissioner, ordered 28 other US insurers to make a total of Dollars 1.25bn in Proposition 103 repayments. In a separate action, Mr Garamendi ordered Farmers to end its policy of issuing earthquake insurance policies with deductibles of up to 25 per cent.</p>

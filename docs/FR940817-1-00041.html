			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FAA recognizes that many certificated aviation maintenance technicians, who support Part 91 operations or other maintenance facilities without maintenance or preventive maintenance training programs in place, receive periodic maintenance training. For example, these aviation maintenance technicians may receive training through aviation training centers or manufacturer's courses. The proposed rule would permit this type of maintenance instruction to be credited toward the hours needed to complete the proposed training requirements, provided the instruction is acceptable to the Administrator. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The training required under this provision, as set forth in proposed &sect;66.83, encompasses more types of training than the training that may be used to satisfy the provision of the proposed &sect;66.81. Therefore, compliance with proposed &sect;66.83 does not automatically authorize the aviation maintenance technician to perform a specific task. Additionally, equipment-specific training is encompassed within the concept of ``training appropriate to the duties of an aviation maintenance technician.'' Equipment-specific training used by the aviation maintenance technician to satisfy the requirements of proposed &sect;66.81 also may be used to satisfy the proposed currency requirements. For example, an aviation maintenance technician who received maintenance training on a Gulfstream IV aircraft that enabled the aviation maintenance technician to perform work on that specific aircraft may credit the hours of instruction received toward the training required in proposed &sect;66.83. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An individual who exercises the privileges of the certificate, but not for compensation or hire, would not need to complete these training requirements. Many of the individuals who do not exercise their privileges for compensation or hire perform only limited work on aircraft that they own or on a limited range of aeronautical equipment. In such cases, knowledge of a broad range of current maintenance technologies is not necessarily required. Although the FAA encourages these personnel to attend refresher training, the FAA has determined that a mandatory training requirement for these individuals is not warranted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposal also sets forth a provision that would permit an aviation maintenance technician who has not exercised the privileges of the certificate within the preceding 24 months to exercise the privileges of the certificate including for compensation or hire by completing requalification training acceptable to the Administrator. A specific minimum time for requalification training has not been specified in the proposed regulation in order to provide instructors and examiners with greater flexibility in assisting non-current aviation maintenance technicians to achieve the required proficiency. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An additional change to the current rule would enhance the ability of non-current aviation maintenance technicians to regain the currency required to exercise the privileges of their certificate and ratings. The proposed rule would allow these individuals to credit the time they work under the supervision of a certificated aviation maintenance technician toward currency requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The holder also may continue to exercise the privileges of the certificate and associated ratings if the Administrator finds that the aviation maintenance technician is competent to exercise those privileges. Passing an oral and practical test with a designed aviation maintenance technician examiner (currently, a designated mechanic examiner (DME)) would satisfy this requirement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sections 121.375, 127.137, and 135.433 require that an operator have a training program to ensure that persons performing maintenance or preventive maintenance functions are informed fully about procedures and techniques and new equipment in use. Additionally, &sect;145.2(a) requires that repair stations performing maintenance for a Part 121 or 127 operator comply with either Part 121, Subpart L (which includes the requirements of &sect;121.375) or Part 127, Subpart I (which includes the requirements of &sect;127.137). Compliance with any of these sections meets the intent of the proposed rule. Individuals exercising the privileges of their certificates under the provisions of these sections, therefore, need not comply with the training requirements set forth in the proposed rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, an aviation maintenance instructor teaching under an aviation maintenance training program acceptable to the Administrator need not comply with these proposed training requirements. As a result of their position as aviation maintenance instructors, these individuals continually are exposed to current maintenance practices and often disseminate information about new practices, techniques, and equipment to the aviation maintenance community. The intent of the proposed rule would be satisfied because their position requires these individuals to be fully informed about current maintenance practices. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In recognition of enhancements in training technology, the proposed rule also requires successful completion of these courses rather than attendance and successful completion. Therefore, the Administrator may find home study or video courses acceptable for fulfilling the requirements specified in the proposed &sect;66.83. However, any training should include a substantial review of regulations pertinent to the exercise of the privileges and limitations of the aviation maintenance technician certificate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposal for continued aviation maintenance training addresses concerns such as those expressed in recent proposals to require formal training for all aircraft mechanic applicants. In conjunction with the issuance of a proposed final rule, the FAA will develop policy on the content and conduct of any aviation maintenance technician refresher course, other training appropriate to the duties of the aviation maintenance technician (including equipment-specific training), and requalification training. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

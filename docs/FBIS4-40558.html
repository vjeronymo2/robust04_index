			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 17 TASS -- Russian President Boris  Yeltsin failed to receive Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet  on Friday because he has to solve urgent problems which have  accumulated during the three days of his absence from Moscow, a  high-ranking Kremlin official told TASS on Friday adding that  "there are no politics behind the cancelled meeting".    He added that the meeting was planned only in a preliminary  way. "As far as the Russian-Vietnamese documents are signed at  the level and upon mutual agreement of the prime ministers of  both countries, Boris Yeltsin who has been absent from Moscow  for three days, is busy with urgent state affairs today", the  official said. He did not elaborate.    Yeltsin spent three days touring the Russian Far East.    The TASS correspondent who was at the government Vnukovo-2  Airport on Thursday when the president returned back to Moscow  reported that the presidential escort waited for 45 minutes  while Yeltsin was talking right at the entrance to the airport  with Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, chief of his staff Sergey  Filatov and Interior Minister Viktor Yerin. There was a feeling  that a lot of questions have been awaiting the president in  Moscow since his departure.</p>

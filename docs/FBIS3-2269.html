			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Huanli (1728 3562 0448)] </F>   [Text] Fukuoka, 2 Mar (XINHUA) -- At an interview with NHK  reporter Tayatoshi Inoue here today, visiting Vice Premier Zhu  Rongji pointed out that Sino-Japanese friendship and cooperation  have enjoyed immense popular support.    When answering NHK reporter's question on his impressions  and  achievements of the trip, Zhu Rongji reiterated his gratitude  for the Japanese Government's extremely kind invitation and  considerate arrangements and the warm welcome extended by the  Japanese people from various sectors. He said: "During my  visit, I have met with His Majesty, the Emperor. I have held  very cordial talks with Prime Minister Hosokawa, Deputy Prime  Minister Hata, and people from the government and  nongovernmental sectors. I would like to point out particularly  that I have made extensive contacts and in-depth exchanges with  people from the Japanese economic sector. I have held talks  with 260 key leaders of Japan's large enterprise groups, large  companies, and major banks. More than 1,400 entrepreneurs and  industrialists have personally attended my talks and speeches."    Zhu Rongji stressed: After conducting the above activities,  I have formed two distinct impressions: First, Sino-Japanese  friendship and cooperation have enjoyed immense popular support  and have become a trend sweeping across Japan. I firmly believe  that this kind of thinking will not change, no matter how the  Japanese political situation develops and what happens in the  rest of the world. Second, Japanese entrepreneurs and  industrialists are very keen to strengthen Sino-Japanese  economic cooperation. Through my visit, the Japanese economic  sectors have improved their understanding of China's rapid  economic progress; have clarified some of their doubts on  China's economic reform; and have confirmed their confidence to  expand Sino-Japanese economic, trade, and technical cooperation.    Commenting on the prospects of Sino-Japanese economic  cooperation, Zhu Rongji said: China and Japan can be very  complementary economically. Both sides can make up each other's  deficiencies. Various elements, including favorable  opportunities, close geographical locations, support of the  people, and other political, economic, and cultural factors, are  conducive for Sino- Japanese economic cooperation to develop  further. In 1993, China and Japan created three "firsts" in  their bilateral economic and trade relations. First,  Sino-Japanese trading value reached a record high of $39  billion. Japan has become China's largest trading partner,  whereas China has become, for the first time, Japan's second  largest trading partner. Second, imports of Japan's technology  has become the largest item, or 28 percent, of China's total  technology imports. Third, Japanese entrepreneurs were on the  top of the list of foreign investors who fulfilled their  investment-funds commitments in China. We are satisfied that  Sino-Japanese economic and trade relations have been developing  rapidly. Such progress is not only beneficial to China, but  also to Japan's economic recovery. The figure of $39 billion is  not big. When we consider the potential of Sino-Japanese  bilateral cooperation, it is a very small figure. Our prospects  are encouraging. Japan's principal way of transferring  technology to China is by forming joint ventures that produce  goods under jointly funded and operated formats. Such  arrangement will only increase Japanese products'  competitiveness in foreign markets. By cooperating to develop  world markets, China and Japan are cooperating and mutually  benefiting partners on an equal footing. They are not competing  adversaries.    When asked to comment on Japan's economic recession, Zhu  Rongji said: Economic recession is not merely a problem in  Japan, but also in the West as a whole. To combat its current  economic problems, the most important steps the Japanese  Government should take are, in addition to such traditional ways  as taking interventionist measures and stimulating demands, to  restructure its industry to make its product more competitive  and to explore overseas markets. The most effective way is to  strengthen its cooperation with Asia -- China especially -- a  region in which economic development is the most vital and  fastest in the world today. The past two years have proven that  the development of such economic cooperation has been very  favorable for Japan's economic recovery.    Speaking on Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's forthcoming  visit to China, Zhu Rongji said: The Chinese Government and  people attach great importance to Prime Minister Hosokawa's  visit. This will be an important event in the development of  Sino-Japanese relations this year. President Jiang Zemin and  Premier Li Peng are looking forward to having fruitful talks  with Prime Minister Hosokawa. His visit certainly will push the  two countries' good neighborly, reciprocal, and cooperative  relations to a new level.    In response to a question about the issue of the MFN status  between China and the United States and the prospects for  Sino-U.S. economic and trade relations, Zhu Rongji said: This  is an issue which is heatedly debated every year. The MFN  status is the foundation of normal Sino-U.S. trade. Both  countries will suffer if this foundation is shaken. In fact, it  is the United States, not China, that will suffer the most. We  hope this issue can be resolved once and for all. There are two  different views toward this issue in the United States. Some  people think that the MFN status should be linked to the "human  rights" issue, but others think that these are two totally  different issues that should not be linked together. More and  more Americans now support the latter view. I hope reason will  prevail.    Zhu Rongji pointed out: The development of Sino-U.S.  economic and trade relations over the last two years has been  fast and many large American enterprises have invested in China.  In fact, U.S. investment in China has now exceeded that of  Japan. The prospects for Sino-U.S. economic and trade relations  are bright.    Commenting on inflation in China, Zhu Rongji said: Some  inflation is unavoidable in development countries. The index of  China's commodity price increase was always kept under 6 percent  during the 1990-92 period. Last year's 13-percent increase was  a bit too high. The causes of the price increase are price  reform and the decontrolling of prices for grain and certain  capital goods, as well as excessive investments. However, price  reform is essential for building a market economy. But I  believe that this year's price increase rate will be kept under  10 percent, and it will be kept to about 6 percent next year,  when the price reform will be basically accomplished.    Zhu Rongji pointed out: We have taken several steps to bring  inflation under control. First, we have taken strict measures  to control investments and capital construction projects from  becoming too excessive. Good things need not be accomplished in  one day. To this end, the CPC Central Committee and the State  Council have decided to strictly control the money supply by  adopting a stringent monetary policy. Second, we have strictly  controlled expenditures by adopting a stringent financial  policy. We have changed our previous practice of making up  deficits by issuing more paper money with the practice of  floating treasury bonds. The quantity of treasury bonds we will  float this year will account for approximately the same  proportion in our budget as the quantity of national debts Japan  will issue this year. I believe we can balance our financial  receipts and payments this year. Third, we have attached great  importance to supporting agricultural development and the "food  basket project." The Chinese consumer goods market has more  supply than demand today, and agriculture is what we must attend  to today. As long as we are able to ensure the success of grain  output and the "food basket project," commodity prices will not  be a big problem.    Answering a question about China's regional differences and  differences in people's incomes, Zhu Rongji said: In China's  rapidly developing economy, the economic development in coastal  areas is faster than that in interior China, the increase of  incomes of people in cities is faster than that of people in  rural areas, and the increase of incomes of people of certain  strata is faster than that of government functionaries. We are  attending to these problems, which have also occurred in many  developing countries.    Zhu Rongji stressed: While coastal area development  certainly is faster because of its good conditions, the economic  development in interior China has also been significant in  recent years. To reduce the differences between coastal and  interior areas, the most important requirement is to develop  communications and transportation. The economic development in  interior China, which has rich natural resources, will be  significantly expedited as long as transportation problems have  been resolved. This being the case, the Chinese Government has  been giving central and western parts preferential treatment in  terms of investments needed for the development of their  communications, energy resources, and raw and semifinished  materials. Of all those projects we have presented to the  Japanese Government to consider for granting the fourth yen  loan, projects to be carried out in central and western China  account for 70 percent.    Zhu Rongji said: As for the difference in individual  incomes, this is because of our policies which link individual  incomes with economic returns, which give more to those who work  more, which allow some people to become affluent first, and  which oppose egalitarianism. The fundamental way to deal with  unfair distribution in society is to expedite economic  development so that the country will have a greater capacity for  improving the living standards of its people. We will also  regulate distribution by reforming the tax system, and will  gradually improve the social security system to ensure social  stability.</p>

			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / Housing surveys give mixed picture Two surveys based on different aspects of the housing market gave a mixed picture of the state of mortgage lending in November, though there was still no sign of a vigorous recovery. Barclays Bank's mortgage lending index suggests gross mortgage lending rose by 0.3 per cent compared with October, to be 2.5 per cent higher than November last year. At the same time, however, a gloomier impression emerged from the property sales figures released on behalf of corporate estate agents. These showed sales had fallen by 10.3 per cent in November compared with October.</p>

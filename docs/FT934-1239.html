			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Gatt: Correction The Financial Times of December 16 incorrectly quoted Mr Nikolaus Boemcke, secretary general of the European Banking Federation, as implying that financial services and shipping had been excluded from the Uruguay Round agreement on global trade liberalisation. In fact, both sectors are included in the agreement. Further talks are continuing to settle outstanding differences in these areas.</p>

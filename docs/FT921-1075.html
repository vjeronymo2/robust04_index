			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Why viewers find some TV soaps are a turn-on / Investigating new research into the way people watch programmes Television viewers switch naturally between two distinct modes of watching programmes - active and passive - according to new advertising industry research. The difference could be crucial for advertisers because evidence suggests that when people are watching passively, they remember little of what they have seen - which means that advertisments stand little chance of making an impact. Viewers, for instance, tend to watch TV-am, the commercial breakfast channel passively, although they may briefly become active if there is a particular item they are interested in. By contrast, they are much more engaged when they are watching ITN's News at Ten. The BBC soap opera EastEnders with subject matter covering topics such as Aids, homosexuality and rape is avidly watched and received high levels of recall, says Jim Marshall, managing director of The Media Centre, which is part of the DMB&amp;B advertising agency and one of those responsible for the new research. Neighbours, the Australian-made soap also shown on the BBC, was viewed and enjoyed by a similar number of respondents in the research project, but the programme was not absorbed in the same way. 'Most could remember little or nothing about its plot or subject matter,' said Marshall who presented the research findings with Margaret Tulley, planning director at DMB&amp;B, at a Media Week conference in Harrogate last week. The message seems to be that if programmes are challenging and involving, viewers watch them actively. Bland programmes produce bland viewing. Marshall argued that research in both the UK and the US found that there was a direct relationship between the impact a programme had and 'the way that people process advertising'. Viewing habits have changed in the last decade. A similar study conducted 10 years ago found that there was still a feeling of magic about television as families gathered around the screen. That has now gone: people take television and the extra choice of programmes and channels, immediate news coverage and sophisticated video effects, entirely for granted. Viewers happily chose to watch individual programmes on minority channels yet the old distinction between 'selective' and 'non-selective viewers' is now far too crude. 'Different audiences watch different programmes in different ways and this can vary by day of week, through the day, or even in the course of an evening,' Tulley believes. For advertisers and advertising agencies, the implications are clear, Tulley believes: it makes sense to schedule advertising against certain programmes which are more engaging to particular target audiences. DMB&amp;B plans to continue the research and believes that far more qualitative research is needed on the way viewers interact with their television sets - not as a substitute for counting the audience, as in traditional ratings measurement, but as a supplement to it.</p>

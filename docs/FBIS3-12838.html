			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 6 Mar (MENA)--The newspaper AL-AHRAM has  emphasized that the problems resulting from the widening scope  of extremist actions in the region requires that their impact on  the Middle East peace process be neutralized. This problem  requires a radical solution because the developments over the  past two years have shown that such a solution is in the best  interests of all parties. In an editorial today, the paper says  that it is insufficient to disarm the extremists in settlements  or even to impose international protection of the Palestinians  as a temporary measure until the issue of settlements has been  resolved, noting that a basic solution lies in deporting the  settlers and extremists from the occupied land.    AL-AHRAM states that the Israeli views of keeping the  settlements in the occupied territories have become  old-fashioned given the new realities of Jewish extremism. The  paper says that certain facts about Jewish extremism that  emerged after the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre showed that there  are training camps and command posts that extend to the United  States. In addition, these realities demonstrated the American  Jews' support for the Jewish extremists in Israel and inside the  occupied territories, a fact that has made the U.S.  Administration express its concern.</p>

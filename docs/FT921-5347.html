			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Arts: Jan Garbarek Group - Royal Festival Hall That Jan Garbarek's best selling album, I took up the runes (ECM 1419/New Note), sold best in his native Norway - per capita  - says much about his recent playing and writing. The saxophonist is one of the German label's most popular artists and his mistily evocative music is at present spreading around the UK as part of the newly-launched Silk Cut City Jazz programme. His group looks and sounds a splendidly Norse affair, as befits the material. Beside the ascetic form of black-suited Garbarek sits Eberhard Weber, flaxen hair falling around his electro-bass contraption. Marilyn Mazur, from Denmark and previously heard with Miles Davis and Wayne Shorter, stands in the middle of a mixture of exotic percussion and conventional kit performing an elfin dance. The round, bald, yet otherwise hirsute head of Rainer Bruninghaus peers from behind the keyboards which provide the chilly soundscape. The trademark plaintiveness of Garbarek's own playing cuts this melancholic accompaniment through, simple hummable melodies ebbing and flowing between stark improvisation. With the thematic material of 'Runes', which quotes Nordic folk tales or joiks, he switches easily from swirling drama on tenor to persuasive and snaking lamentation on soprano. Garbarek might not improvise in the conventional jazz sense, but his shrill solo excursions are a marvellous and integral part of the whole. Weber, an ECM frontman in his own right, is a similarly outstanding soloist: the masterly technique and bass technology summed up to great melancholic effect. Bowed, plucked, whittled and beaten before passing through his box of pedalled tricks, the electro-bass's rich sounds are mesmerising in his hands. Garbarek's arrangements, with their strong melodic undercurrents, are ideal for Weber's romantic and grandiloquent ideas. Mazur, who replaces Nana Vasconcelos in the original Runes line-up, should simply add to the Scandinavian element but instead brings a curious Eastern feel with her tiny bells and gongs. Her playing has the appearance of musical T'ai Chi as she makes sweeping runs around the cymbals and then suddenly drops to her feet to strike at wood blocks. Bruninghaus, in control of the dynamics with his synth, is a strident soloist at the grand. If Garbarek's work with this ensemble is designed to send a shiver down the spine it does so pleasurably. It fills the senses with North European tradition, the smell of conifers and wood smoke. One wonders what his next outing on ECM will offer, given that it features musicians from Pakistan.</p>

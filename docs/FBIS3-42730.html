When the Presidium of the Supreme Council of Ukraine  resolved  to hold the present representative forum, it proceeded from  working out together with you uniform approaches to the main  problems of further reforms in the political systems and to  preparations for and the holding of the next elections, because  reforming the system without holding elections is virtually  impossible.    The current stage of development in Ukraine necessitates the  increased role of the organs of power in managing all processes  in society.    As is known, the Declaration of State Sovereignty of Ukraine  set forth the main principle for building state power in our  country by establishing that it should be exercised on the basis  of its separation into legislative, executive, and judicial  authority. The attempt to follow this principle under the old  Constitution, which was adopted when Ukraine still belonged to  the Soviet Union, turned out to be unrealizable, although  substantive amendments and additions have been made to it. You  know of the contradictions that have developed not only between  individual branches of power but also between the center and the  local organs of power, and local self-government.    All of this has influenced the status of state discipline,  brought about a power imbalance, and provided grounds for abuse  by certain employees and other state organizations, as well as  those who were employed directly in the sphere of material  production.    For this reason, questions of political reform,  determination  of the jurisdiction of central and local state organs, as well  as the organs of local self-government, and the codification of  mechanisms for their interaction at the constitutional level  represent the path that will help in cementing the state  structure and overcoming the dual power that has actually  emerged within the system of executive power.    A certain step forward in this area has been taken in the  draft of the new Constitution of Ukraine which was published in  October of last year. It was based on a  parliamentary-presidential model of government; it set forth the  forms of a state and territorial system, as well as the main  powers of the power structures at all levels.    The issue is for the organs of power to actually influence  economic and social processes and determine the nature of  further development of the regions. This is first of all  associated with the fact that solving the problems of economic  reforms, denationalization of property, social support for the  population, and economic development, as well as ensuring legal  order and stability in society, is being to a considerable  degree shifted to the regional level. We want to build a  democratic rule-of-law state. The path toward it is long,  thorny, and difficult, as the past two-year period has convinced  us.    The deterioration of the economic and social situation  generates criticism of the power structure which, I will tell  you openly, is extremely hard to bear.    Some accuse the leadership of conservatism. Can radical  political and economic reforms get underway in Ukraine, they  say, if former "Communist Party people" who brought about the  crisis in the country remain in power? Can they lead us out of  the crisis? Others, especially those who were in power  previously, exploit in every way possible the version that  someone betrayed someone else. There also are politicians who,  in pursuit of their own goals, see the breakup of the Union and  the abandonment of "socialist orientation" as the cause of all  adversity.    I would like to repeat today what I have said repeatedly.  The  process now taking place in our society is a process of  transformation of the administrative-command system into a  democratic system, of transition to the market mode of economic  development. This process develops in keeping with objective  laws of development of the economy and society, and it cannot  develop otherwise. This is happening not only in Ukraine but  also in other countries of the former USSR and Eastern Europe,  and Ukraine cannot remain some kind of island. Naturally, it may  have certain national peculiarities as far as the form and  content of reforms are concerned; however, in many respects it  should adapt to the generally recognized rules for this process.    No matter what our opponents say (they are many, and this is  good), the Supreme Council of the current term has prepared many  laws, but has also made a great deal of mistakes in the process.  More than 350 laws and 1,030 decrees have already been adopted.  However, two characteristic peculiarities should be taken into  account in all of this. First, we have entered the first stage  of the creation of a state in which all these acts are needed.  Second, their content objectively reflects the condition of our  society and the economy, as well as various approaches and the  diversity of the thoughts of legislators. Under our conditions  it is impossible to work out the only correct and perfect laws  for a long period of time. Therefore, they should of course  undergo changes in line with social processes.    The following question is frequently asked: What  socioeconomic and political system does the new draft  Constitution of Ukraine codify?    It appears to me that an answer to this question may be as  follows: a civic society and a rule-of-law state.    As far as the main signs of such a society and state are  concerned, they are indicated quite specifically in the draft  Main Law, in particular:    recognition of the individual, his life, rights, and  freedoms  as the supreme value;    proclamation that the people of Ukraine are the sole source  of power,    economic, political, and ideological diversity embodied in a  multiparty system, guarantees for various forms of ownership and  economic operations, and social orientation of the economy;    recognition of the primacy of the law with regard to state  power, and of the civic society with regard to the state.    It is frequently asserted that this also has the marks of  capitalism. What can we say to this? Perhaps so, but it is not  the kind of capitalism with which they scared us for decades but  rather that which has already been built in Sweden, Austria,  Switzerland, and a number of other European countries with  developed democracies and market economies. May God grant us the  building of the social order which the aforementioned states  have, because they have considerably more social protection and  guarantees for the people than we had under the "developed phase  of socialism." I think that few will object at present to such a  model of the organization of society and the state.    The draft of the new Constitution sets forth, on a  conceptual  basis different from the one in the Constitution in effect, the  system, structure, and procedure for the formation, functions,  and powers of the organs of legislative, executive, and judicial  power, as well as the organs of local self-government.    Many proposals to accelerate the adoption of the new  Constitution of Ukraine are received by the Supreme Council.    These proposals come down to several variants.    First, this could be done by the current Supreme Council,  having traveled with dignity the path from the Declaration of  State Sovereignty of Ukraine to its new Constitution, although  this variant may already be unrealistic.    Second, the Constitution could be adopted by the new Supreme  Council. However, for the latter, the developed draft would be a  new document, and time would be needed to master and adopt it.  During this period there would not be a proper legal basis for  forming the organs of state power.    There also were the following proposals: either convene a  special Constitutional Conference (assembly) which on assignment  from the Supreme Council could itself adopt this draft, or  submit it to an All-Ukrainian Referendum on 27 March 1994,  simultaneously with the election of people's deputies.    As you know, a meeting of the Commission for the Development  of the New Constitution was held in this auditorium on 12  January with the participation of the chairmen of oblast  councils, city councils of the city-seats of oblasts,  representatives of the president in the oblasts and in the  cities of Kiev and Sevastopol, heads of political parties and  trade unions, and scientists.    The main principles of the construction of state organs in  the center and locally were discussed, as well as prospects for  the adoption of the new Constitution of Ukraine. In view of the  fact that a majority of those present at that meeting expressed  doubts about the possibility of the Supreme Council adopting the  Constitution shortly, it was agreed to prepare the draft of a  separate constitutional law or statute in which the main  principles for the organization of state power and  self-government in Ukraine would be codified.    The adoption of such a Constitutional act is necessitated by  the urgent need to precisely regulate the powers of all branches  of state power and eliminate duplication and lack of  coordination in their operations as early as this stage of  building the state.    Proposals worked out on the basis of the discussion have  been  incorporated in the draft that has been handed out to you. It is  envisioned that this draft, with today's discussion taken into  account, could be submitted to the Supreme Council so as to be  placed, by its decision, on the All-Ukrainian Referendum which  would be held together with the election of people's deputies on  27 March. For now, we do not see a different way.    If a draft of such significance to the creation of the state  is approved, it will, to our mind, make it possible to:    specify stable foundations for the buildup of legislative,  executive, and judicial organs and organs of local  self-government of our state;    lay a secure foundation which is approved by the people for  the new Constitution of Ukraine;    codify the jurisdictions and powers of all branches of  central power, to clearly delineate the performance of their  functions, as well as to delineate the powers of state organs  and organs of local self-government.    The adoption of this constitutional act will make it  possible  to reinforce the government and will open new opportunities for  carrying out economic transformations and overcoming the lack of  coordination which now exist. Besides, nobody will have the  right to change tomorrow what is accepted today.    What principles does the draft of the Main Constitutional  Provisions for the organization of state power and  self-government in Ukraine propose to codify?    First of all, the main functions of the Supreme Council as  the organ of legislative power are refined, and its influence on  the government is strengthened. This document also envisions  divorcing the powers of the head of state and head of the  executive power.    Under the Constitution in effect, the president of Ukraine  is  the head of state and head of the executive power, whereas the  draft envisions distribution of these powers. The president of  Ukraine remains the head of state. The Cabinet of Ministers of  Ukraine becomes the supreme organ of executive power.    As the head of state, the president of Ukraine will have the  right to veto laws adopted by the Supreme Council and return  them for repeat consideration, and to call all-Ukrainian  referendums on lack of confidence in the Supreme Council. His  powers will include the right to act on behalf of the state,  represent it in international relations, be commander in chief  of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, resolve issues of citizenship,  as well as other constitutional powers.    The president will also retain certain powers as to the  formation of the structures of executive power. In particular,  he will nominate, for the appointment by the Supreme Council, a  candidate for prime minister who, in turn, will form the  membership of the Cabinet of Ministers and present it to the  Supreme Council.    Therefore, the executive authority as represented by the  Cabinet of Ministers will become completely independent in  exercising its powers. At the same time, the government  continues to report and be accountable to the Supreme Council  and be under the control of the president of Ukraine.    The draft sets forth the main principles for the  construction  of a judicial system in Ukraine. It is envisioned that the  administration of justice will be effected in the form of the  constitutional, civil, criminal, and administrative-law court  proceedings.    Assertions about the need to eliminate councils at the local  level may be heard frequently, even from the lips of some  statesmen. I would like those who harbor such intentions to  understand that, under the draft Constitution and the draft Main  Constitutional Provisions on the organization of state power and  self-government, it is envisioned to transform councils into  organs that perform the state functions delegated to them while  at the same time, most importantly, remaining organs of local  self-government.    Those who advocate the elimination of such councils actually  come out against the democratic principles on which our state is  to be built and fight for a return to the administrative-command  system in one form or another.    Understandably, it is impossible to agree with this. The  implementation of such intentions will result in nothing but  harm.    You would recall that the introduction of the institution of  representatives of the president was considered a temporary  measure to reinforce state discipline locally. At the same time,  it was a mistake to also endow them with the functions of heads  of local state administrations and to deprive rayon and oblast  councils of their own executive organs in conjunction with this.  The "executive vertical chain" did not begin to operate  effectively because of this.    In general, a paradox has occurred in practice whereby the  local state administration tries to negate the operation of  representative organs, reducing the principle of separation of  powers to the absurd. This is happening while no vertical  presidential structure exists in any country of the world.    On the contrary, local self-government has been generally  recognized and codified in acts of international law such as the  World Declaration on Local Self-Government and the European  Charter of Local Self-Government. We took the requirements of  these documents into account in developing the draft law.    Certainly, it is necessary to reform the councils on the  principles of local self-government and, first of all, make them  more flexible and smaller, endow them with real rights and  powers, provide an opportunity to really influence the state of  affairs in their territories. Councils and similar  representative organs of local self-government exist in many  developed countries. They operate autonomously and independently  within the confines of the law and have their own executive  structures.    As you know, in keeping with the provisions in the draft of  the new Constitution, oblast councils and oblast executive  committees which would operate on the principle of separation of  powers were to become the organs of state power in oblasts.    This meant that relations between them would be structured  similarly to those between the Supreme Council and the Cabinet  of Ministers, to be sure, with certain peculiarities. Thus, the  oblast council would act as the parliament of an oblast, and the  executive committee--as the oblast government. Such forms of  government exist in a number of states; perhaps in the future we  will come to them, too.    It was proposed that oblast councils be elected for four  years and consist of deputies whose number would not exceed 75.  The chairman of the oblast council was to be elected by the  council in question from among the deputies.    The composition of the executive committee would be  confirmed  by the oblast council on the petition of its chairman, and the  executive committee itself would be headed by the chairman who  would be elected by the population of the oblast and confirmed  by an edict of the president. The oblast executive committee  would report to the oblast council, as well as be subordinated  to the Cabinet of Ministers and the president.    The above provisions met with criticism from the local  councils.    The triple subordination of the executive committees of  oblasts, as well as the confirmation by the president of their  chairmen who are elected by the people, do not meet with  support. We know that many chairmen of oblast councils propose  to establish a rule in keeping with which either the chairman of  a council will be elected by the oblast council or this position  will be combined with that of the chairman of the executive  organ who will be elected by the population. The idea of  statization of the councils and their executive organs at the  level of oblasts and the cities of Kiev and Sevastopol failed to  gain support.    Taking the above and other proposals into account, the  Constitutional Commission proposed a somewhat different approach  to resolving the issue of power at the oblast level.    The draft of the Main Constitutional Provisions envisions  that the oblast power structures will also be built on the  principles of self-government. It is proposed that the  population of an oblast elect the head of executive power who  would, at the same time, head the council.    It is proposed to introduce the same model at the level of  cities, rayons, settlements, and villages.    The heads of executive power of oblasts, cities, rayons,  settlements, and villages will report to and be under the  control of the respective councils; they will be subordinated to  the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine on issues of exercising the  powers delegated to them by the state.    At least some of you know that there was yet another variant  at an expanded meeting of the Constitutional Commission, as well  as in the course of work on the draft of the Main Constitutional  Provisions--to elect the chairman of the executive committee  rather than the chairman of the council, and to endow him with  the functions of the head of executive power. Therefore, an  exchange of ideas on this issue will certainly occur today.    As far as rayon councils in the cities are concerned, this  issue is regulated in the draft of the new Constitution. Taking  into account practice and the need to perfect the management of  city facilities, it is envisioned to transfer the resolution of  the issues of territorial division of the cities into rayons and  the feasibility of establishing the councils of city rayons  directly to city councils. This provision has been criticized by  some of you, but the majority agree with it.    The draft of the Constitution envisions a substantial  reduction in the number of council members. It is feasible to  take into account the proposals of those who recommend that the  number of their members be determined depending on the number of  residents in a given territory.    Many representatives of the local councils do not like the  word "councilmen." Let us consult and propose a different  version.    Of course, it is possible to do without local  self-government  and introduce rigid centralization of executive power from Kiev  and on down to a rural council. However, such practices are only  characteristic of authoritarian regimes. Naturally, they are  incompatible with the notions of a civic society and a  democratic state of law, which we want to build.    On the contrary, it is very important to give local organs  more real power. At present, somebody will certainly raise the  issue about the generation of local budgets in conjunction with  this. Recently I had a long conversation with a group of council  chairmen from large cities during which they made specific  proposals that are well grounded. What kind of an authority is  it in a city if the chairman of the council must go to Kiev to  wheedle out mere kopeks for the needs of education, health care,  transportation, and communal services? Why take away from them  the funds which they would perhaps manage with greater dispatch  and feasibility locally, usually feeling more responsible for  the formation and use of the local budget?    A mechanism should be found whereby it will be possible to  determine which proportion of the funds should finance local and  regional needs, and which--statewide needs. At present, we do  not take this into account, and want to make it so that the city  or rayon has to go and ask for it if not in Kiev, then at the  oblast seat.    Local authorities should be given more rights with regard to  other issues as well. In this case, they will have more  responsibility and, accordingly, more business sense and more  order.    Now about the issue of the next elections of people's  deputies of Ukraine. Preparations for the elections, as well as  the elections themselves, will take place in a complicated  socioeconomic situation.    However, I would like to stress from the very beginning that  if we want political reforms to get underway, and elections to  be held, we should take urgent measures to stabilize production,  stop inflationary processes, furnish consumer staples to the  people, and provide genuine assistance to the low-income strata  of the population.    An imperfect banking and credit system is one of the main  reasons for the economic crisis we are facing. Serious mistakes  and blunders were allowed to occur in the process of its  assertion.    Of course, we are concerned first of all about the difficult  financial position of the state and inflationary processes,  whose rates we have unfortunately not been able to slow down so  far. All of this brings about the growth of prices and a  considerable decline in the standard of living of the  population. At present, the state is not in a position to ensure  due social protection for even the most unfortunate strata of  the population because the need for funds for these purposes is  greater than the existing opportunities.    Meanwhile, world practice convinces us that no country has  managed to stabilize its economy until those who worked in the  sphere of material production genuinely undertook to do so.  Appropriate conditions should be created for this to happen. No  matter how much we talk about privatization and destatization as  the main goal, productivity and the desired results will not  occur unless appropriate conditions are created for work at  associated, cooperative, collective, private, state, and other  enterprises.    Regardless of the great difficulties and mistakes that were  allowed to occur, the process of economic reform in Ukraine is  being enhanced, albeit slowly. I will give specific numbers,  too. As of the beginning of October of last year, the proportion  of industrial enterprises with nonstate forms of ownership in  the total number of enterprises exceeded 30 percent, and the  volume of products manufactured by them--25 percent. Small-scale  privatization is picking up steam, if slowly. Some reforms have  taken off in rural areas. We already have more than 27,000  owner-operated farms, although the appropriate conditions for  their operation do not exist.    Unfortunately, many reports are now being received from  localities about abuses in the process of privatization and the  imperfection of our laws. People are seriously concerned about  the unprecedented, and in most cases illegal, accumulation of  capital by certain individuals. Most of our population will not  endure such reforms. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce  reforms under which the people will become owners of the means  of production and will have approximately the same conditions at  the outset. Only under such conditions will people be in a  position to display their abilities. The experience of the Czech  Republic, Poland, and other countries, which should be  skillfully used, testifies to this.    Two days from now the Supreme Council will consider the  draft  of the State Plan for Economic and Social Development and the  State Budget of Ukraine for 1994. As I have already said, the  situation in the country is quite difficult, and we should do  everything possible together in order to overcome crisis  phenomena in the economic and social areas.    As is known, in September of last year the Supreme Council  passed a law on early elections of the future parliament and the  president of Ukraine, and made a determination on fundamental  issues regarding the name of the supreme organ of legislative  power of our state, its structure, procedures for its formation,  and the main principles for its operations.    All of this definitely necessitated speeding up the  preparation of a new election law, which was passed on 18  November 1993. However, the search for an optimal model of  electoral system for our state began much earlier. Favorable  domestic and foreign experience in the organization of elections  was taken into account in the course of development of the draft  law. Issues of the electoral system were discussed at applied  scientific conferences, meetings, seminars, in the press, on  television and radio.    As you know, the Supreme Council gave preference to a  majority electoral system, although some people's deputies came  out in favor of a proportional system. There also were  proponents of a mixed electoral system, which I supported, too.  However, a majority of the deputies voted in favor of the  majority electoral system. There is nothing bad about this.  After all, elections are held in keeping with this system in 76  countries of the world, including Great Britain, France, the  United States, Canada, and other countries with developed  democracies in which multiparty systems exist. Now that the law  has been adopted, it should be strictly complied with. All talk  about its advantages or drawbacks at present merely harms the  cause. The election campaign has begun, and our task is to  ensure its successful conduct.    A revision of the norm of the law which regulates procedures  for holding runoff elections is the only point we might agree to.    Lately, voices have been heard to the effect that the  elections will not take place, that the people, having lost  faith in politicians, will not turn out for the elections. This  is said by people who do not wish Ukraine well, who want to go  on hampering economic reforms and the processes of the assertion  of our statehood.    We should explain this to the population while at the same  time shaping public opinion in such a way that deputies will be  elected to the new parliament who are capable of advocating  general state interests and taking an active part in the process  of creating legislation. You know well how elections were  organized previously, and how the 100 percent turnout at polling  stations and the unanimous vote in favor of candidates for  deputy were ensured.    At present, the situation is different: Under the law, all  issues concerning the organization and conduct of the elections  devolve in their entirety on electoral commissions. However,  this does not at all mean that councils and executive organs  should remain on the sidelines of this important political event.    In the course of the election campaign, it is important to  explain to each voter that the future of Ukraine depends on his  personal participation in the elections. The personal  composition of those who will make policy is being formed, of  those who will pass laws that will facilitate the development of  a democratic state and an enhancement of the welfare of the  people.    Notwithstanding the predicament we are now facing, we should  take advantage of every opportunity to lift the spirits of the  people. There should be no such thing as a trifle in this matter.    I would say that the election of the parliament on the day  of  the elections, 27 March, and if the referendum is also held on  that day, its results, too, directly depend on all of us in  attendance in this auditorium.    In summation, I would like to stress that it is impossible  to  successfully accomplish the tasks facing our state in the  absence of a renewal of the form and content of the activities  of all structures of power and enhancement of their role and  responsibility.    Thank you for your attention.</p>

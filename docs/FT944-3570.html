			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Benn warns Commons on sleaze The House of Commons is on trial over its handling of recent allegations of sleaze against MPs, Mr Tony Benn said last night as he tried to persuade MPs not to vote to remove him from the powerful Commons privileges committee. The veteran leftwing Labour MP said the real issue at stake was not his removal from the committee, which is investigating allegations of misbehaviour against two Tory MPs, but whether it was right for the committee's deliberations to be reported. 'If the House decides to retreat behind its traditional practice of working in secret, it will be making a very great mistake that could damage parliament and public confidence in us,' he said. 'It is the House which is ultimately responsible for having set itself such low standards of public conduct.' Speaking before the vote, Mr Benn set out a six-point blueprint for raising standards in public life. He called for the use of 'parliamentary influence' in return for payment to be treated as a breach of privilege and for the rules governing the private interests of ministers to apply to all MPs. He said the powers to investigate MPs charged with a breach of these rules should be transferred to the courts. It should be made illegal for any outside company or organisation to pay MPs for 'parliamentary services designed to win influence'. It would put 'a complete stop' to the peddling of influence. The former Labour cabinet minister said if the steps he proposed were taken, it would not prevent MPs from maintaining their professions. Nor would it prevent political contributions being paid to candidates or parties - 'under proper safeguards'. Mr Benn was voted off the committee last month by the 17 MPs who sit on it after he gave the press an account of the discussions at its last meeting. He can only be formally removed after a vote by the entire House. It is understood that only two MPs - Mr Bill Michie, the MP for Sheffield Heeley, and Mr Benn himself - voted against the expulsion. One Labour committee member said that he backed the principle of opening up some committee sessions but Mr Benn's policy of giving the press an account of private sessions could not be justified.</p>

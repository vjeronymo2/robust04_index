			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Aegis refinances as profits fall to Pounds 13m AEGIS, the European media buyer which last month saw the sudden departure of Mr Peter Scott, chairman, yesterday announced a refinancing which will further increase the control of the company's two main shareholders, Mr Gilbert Gross and Warburg, Pincus, the US investment bank. Aegis is rescheduling outstanding payments due on the purchase of Carat Espace, the French media buyer which it bought from Mr Gross and its management. This will allow an extension of Aegis' banking facilities, provided by Samuel Montagu. Aegis will then launch a rights issue of convertible unsecured loan stock to raise Pounds 19.75m, net of expenses. The issue is fully underwritten by Warburg, Pincus, which holds 14.8 per cent of Aegis. Aegis has also been told by the Takeover Panel that following its decision to shift headquarters to Paris, the official reason given for Mr Scott's departure, it will not fall under the takeover code since it will no longer be considered resident in the UK. Under the debt rescheduling, SFEC, a company controlled by Mr Gross, will receive Pounds 18.75m in new shares and Pounds 25m in cash. The new structure differs from the original payment plan by accelerating the share element but reducing the cash portion. As a result SFEC's holding will increase from 26.8 per cent to 42.4 per cent. The transaction received a waiver from the Panel because the shares are a form of payment. SFEC will transfer its rights to the convertible loan stock to Warburg, Pincus. As a result, and assuming the rest of the rights are taken up, Warburg Pincus' voting rights will increase from 14.8 per cent to 16.4 per cent, while SFEC will hold 33.8 per cent of the voting rights. Under the rights, Aegis is issuing 22.5m units at Pounds 1. Each unit includes a deferred share of 1p and a 9.875 per cent convertible unsecured loan stock, redeemable in 2002 and with a conversion price of 55p. The company's shares, which more than halved in value following Mr Scott's resignation, fell a further 7p to 39p. Aegis also announced a slump in pre-tax profits from Pounds 31.3m to Pounds 13.5m in the six months to June 31. Turnover increased 42 per cent to Pounds 1.39bn due to acquisitions and new business. Operating margins were affected by competition and the move to Paris incurred exceptional costs of nearly Pounds 14m. Losses per share were 2.1p, against earnings of 13.97p or 11.77p fully diluted. The interim dividend is cut to 1.375p (2.75p). Mr Charles Hochman will replace Mr Scott as chief executive in September. Mr Frank Law, the deputy chairman, has been appointed non-executive chairman from the same date.</p>

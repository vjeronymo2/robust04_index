			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / International Company News: Nat Semi reports record earnings as sales top Dollars 2bn NATIONAL Semiconductor, the US chip maker which last year restructured its global operations, reported record sales and earnings for 1992-93, lifted by a strong fourth quarter. Net earnings for the year ended May were Dollars 130.3m, or 98 cents a share, compared with a loss of Dollars 120.1m, or Dollars 1.24, a year earlier, after restructuring charges of Dollars 149.3m. Sales rose to Dollars 2.01bn from Dollars 1.72bn. 'Passing the Dollars 2bn milestone in sales with record earnings represents a real resurgence of both growth and profitability at National Semiconductor,' said Mr Gilbert Amelio, president and chief executive. 'I am gratified by the success of our efforts to rebuild the company, and confident that we will be able to maintain our momentum.' For the fourth quarter, National reported net earnings of Dollars 46.2m, or 35 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 557.9m, compared with net earnings of Dollars 27.5m, or 22 cents, on sales of Dollars 491.5m in the same period last year. 'The past year was a period of tremendous progress at National Semiconductor. We completed a large portion of our planned restructuring activities, including significant expansion of our manufacturing centres at Arlington, Texas, and Greenock, Scotland,' Mr Amelio said. Over the past year, National cut its workforce by 3,800 people to 23,400, cut back production in California and sold an assembly and test facility in Bangkok. Commenting on market conditions, Mr Amelio said that National expected orders to weaken during the traditionally slow summer quarter, but that sales may drop only marginally below the fourth-quarter level.</p>

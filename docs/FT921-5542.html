			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Dutch market shows top February gains DUTCH government bonds outperformed other government bond markets last month, helped by better-than-expected inflation figures and the prospect of lower levels of issuance during the rest of the year, writes Sara Webb. JP Morgan's government bond figures for February show Dutch state bonds gaining 1.4 per cent in local currency terms, with the 10-year yield spread over German government bonds narrowing by over 10 basis points. The Dutch Treasury completed about one-third of its annual borrowing needs in January, so worries about future levels of supply have diminished. Hopes of a cut in interest rates boosted UK government bond prices, which gained 1.38 per cent in February and 4.04 per cent since the start of the year, making gilts the top-performing bonds so far this year. Japan was the worst-performing bond market last month, gaining only 0.21 per cent in yen terms and falling 2.58 per cent in US dollar terms. Australia was the top-performing bond market last month in US dollar terms. The market was helped by a slight strengthening of the Australian dollar against the US currency due to budget uncertainty. Australian bonds gained 1.16 per cent, although since the start of the year they have fallen by 2.98 per cent.</p>

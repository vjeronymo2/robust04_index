			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INNOVATION: A BUMPER CROP OF INDUSTRIAL HYPOCRISY  </P> <P> Picture, in this era of ruthlessly competitive global markets, a strategically  vital industry running a healthy $18-billion annual trade surplus. Now factor  in that this industry receives more than $10 billion in direct government  subsidies and more than $1.2 billion in government-sponsored high-tech research  and development.  </P> <P> If Japan were doing this in silicon chips or West Germany in numerically  controlled machine tools, the United States would be quick to threaten Super  301 trade sanctions. The free marketeers in Washington would piously call for  "level playing fields" and warn of the pernicious evils of "industrial policy."  </P> <P> Of course, that "strategically vital industry" is America's own agriculture. In  fact, the United States has a long, rich (and expensive) history of government  involvement in agriculture. From the Morrill Act of 1862 that established the  land-grant colleges to today's emerging cornucopia of plant biotechnologies,  it's impossible to imagine American agribusiness being so global without the  not-so-invisible hand of American government.  </P> <P> By any measure you wish to apply, every element of U.S. agribusiness history  practically shrieks "industrial policy." "We've had a 'cheap food' policy in  this country for years, using income transfers and other techniques to keep  prices down," says Harold O. Carter, professor of agricultural economics and  director of the UC Agricultural Issues Center at UC Davis. "We'd be aghast if  people had to pay $2 a pound for poultry."  </P> <P> (By contrast, Carter says, European countries "really pampered" their farmers  and that's why "food costs there have been so fantastic.")  </P> <P> The Agricultural Extension Service, the massively elaborate labyrinth of loans,  subsidies and loan guarantees, and a willingness to fund new technologies have  made the Department of Agriculture arguably one of the most successful  practitioners of industrial policy. Today, as advances in biotechnology promise  to transform agriculture, the USDA has cleverly positioned itself as a seed  capitalist in this arena.  </P> <P> "The USDA is clearly moving more toward science-based agricultural  investments," asserts Mark F. Cantley, head of the European Economic  Community's Concertation Unit for Biotechnology in Europe. Indeed, several  European nations have quietly expressed unhappiness over America's increasing  competitiveness in agricultural biotechnology.  </P> <P> I'm confused. When we talk about creating a new partnership between government  and high-technology industries such as semiconductors, policy-makers thrust the  free-market crucifix at the budget-sucking vampires of "industrial policy."  When we continue a century-old tradition of technology transfer, educational  investment and technological innovation in agriculture, it's called: nothing.  There's nary a whisper in the cacophony of policy debate.  </P> <P> When the head of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) -- the  Pentagon's high-tech venture capital arm -- champions the idea of investing to  improve our industrial base, he gets demoted. When the USDA champions the idea  of investing in new materials research and developing new agricultural  products, it gets an R&amp;D budget of more than $1.2 billion. Trust me,  agricultural biotechnology is at least as high tech as anything the Pentagon  funds.  </P> <P> Irony is too nice a word to describe what's going on here. Washington is one of  those towns where, if you're enough of a hypocrite, people actually start  thinking you're a pragmatist. Intellectual integrity becomes a luxury to be  jettisoned at the first sign of a negative poll. The Washington troika of  Richard G. Darman, Michael J. Boskin and John H. Sununu can bray all they want  about the economic sins of industrial policy -- but, clever gentlemen that they  are, they also know how to count votes.  </P> <P> Apply the same standards of free-market philosophical purity to the USDA that  these policy-makers profess, and the agency would be defunded. That will never  happen. The political power of the Farm Belt, California and Texas is just too  strong. What's more, there are actually legislators who care about upgrading  the quality of life in rural America; there are people who want to use the  agricultural infrastructure to make sure that America's farmers have ready  access to tools and techniques to make them more productive.  </P> <P> Is there a legitimate role for government here? "Yes, in terms of maintaining  our competitiveness, reducing dependence on subsidies and creating new products  and services," says USDA Assistant Secretary for Science and Education Charles  E. Hess, formerly the dean of the College of Agriculture at UC Davis.  </P> <P> Indeed, Hess points out, Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio) required that the USDA spend  $50 million to help farmers explore "non-feed, non-food" crops for their lands.  Hess sees the USDA playing a more aggressive role in promoting the development  of biodegradable materials and as a "positive source" of plant-based fuels such  as methanol versus fossil fuels such as oil and coal to combat air pollution.  </P> <P> What's more, "after a fair amount of discussion" with the Office of Management  and Budget, says Hess, the USDA could actually fund initiatives to  commercialize emerging agricultural technologies.  </P> <P> The lesson here is a cynical one: The "debates" surrounding industrial policy  in Washington have little to do with principle and a fundamental belief in the  strength of free markets. On the contrary, our experience with agriculture  proves that the government can be a powerful and productive partner with  private industry. Talk with anyone in agribusiness, and they will tell you that  the networks of land-grant colleges, the Agricultural Extension Service and the  research stations played a critical role in consolidating America's  agricultural pre-eminence.  </P> <P> What the debates about industrial policy and high technology really reveal is  that America's high-tech companies lack political clout. The Intels, Motorolas,  Hewlett-Packards and Crays may be technical wizards, but they are legislative  eunuches. They are incapable of mustering the sort of political pressure,  political action committee money and votes that agribusiness historically has.  </P> <P> I want to make it clear that I'm not a big fan of government intervention in  specific industries; I would be leery of any kind of American Ministry of  International Trade and Industry or civilian DARPA. On the other hand, I'm a  huge fan of honesty and integrity. Those are two qualities that too many  high-ranking Washington policy-makers have made optional.  </P></p>

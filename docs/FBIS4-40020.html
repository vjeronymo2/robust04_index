			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Video report by correspondent Sergey Omelchenko from </F> Georgia, including recorded remarks by Russian Defense Minister  Pavel Grachev; from the "Vesti" newscast]    [Text] [Announcer Nelli Petkova] It is not ruled out that  the operation to introduce peacekeeping forces into the  Georgian-Abkhaz conflict zone could begin in the near future.  ITAR-TASS reports that Eduard Shevardnadze has agreed to  Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev's proposal to immediately  implement the peacekeeping action of the Russian Armed Forces in  Abkhazia.    [Omelchenko] At the meetings with Eduard Shevardnadze, head  of the Georgian state, and the republic's Defense Minister  Vardiko Nadibaidze, it was decided to determine the status of  Russian bases in Georgia prior to 1 August and to agree the  peacekeeping mission of the Russian troops on the line of  disengagement between the Georgian and Abkhaz troop units along  the Inguri River.    There will be three Russian military bases on Georgian  territory: in Vaziani not far from Tbilisi, in Akhalkalaki in  the southwest of the republic, and in Batumi.    [Grachev] The main question will now be examined--namely  stepping up peacekeeping along the disengagement line in this  conflict. We will discuss the latest details with Eduard  Amvrosiyevich [Shevardnadze] and then we will get down to  tackling the practical stages of performing peacekeeping with  the military leadership of the group of forces, the commander,  and the defense minister.    [Omelchenko] The paratrooper regiment in Gudauta is  virtually  ready to carry out its peacekeeping mission on Abkhaz territory.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDA also invites comment on the effect of a small business  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exemption on the regulation of imports. How would HACCP be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applied to imports under a tiered approach? Would it be possible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to treat domestic and imported products equally under such an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approach?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Staggered Phase-in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed regulations include an effective date of 1 year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the publication of a final rule. FDA has explained the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasoning behind this proposed effective date and has invited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment on it elsewhere in this preamble. In addition, comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are invited on the merits of a staggered phase-in instead of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> single implementation date for all affected entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The two most obvious ways of accomplishing a staggered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> phase-in would be to differentiate on the basis of size or on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis of risk. Differentiating on the basis of size would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presumably allow small businesses to have a longer time or times  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for implementation than would be allowed for larger firms. As  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggested earlier, large firms are probably much more able to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implement a HACCP system than are small firms. Theoretically,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the longer lead time for small firms would allow the private  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sector to develop an infrastructure that could help small firms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implement HACCP. Such an infrastructure could include process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorities (see the preamble discussion on cooked, ready-to-eat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products), testing facilities, and consulting services from trade  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associations, academia, and others.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As an additional consideration, FDA will likely learn  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lessons from its experiences in implementing the regulation that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it could apply to the benefit of those that would have to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implement it at a later date. For example, FDA is considering  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether it should make the first review of HACCP plans by agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investigators a nonregulatory evaluation to facilitate plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development by the processor (although the overall inspection of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the plant would be regulatory). The agency invites comment on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this approach. Presumably, the more experience the agency has,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the better this evaluation will be.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On the other hand, as noted above, small firms are involved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the processing of higher risk products. How does this fact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bear on the possibility of longer implementation times for small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> firms?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Differentiation solely on the basis of risk appears to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more complex than differentiation on the basis of size. If high  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> risk products were to be phased in first, it would appear that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those with the most complex plans to develop and implement would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receive the shortest lead time, while those with the simplest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plans would receive the longest lead time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, the criteria for determining risk would have to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carefully considered. FDA asks for comment on whether a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> staggered start should begin with raw molluscan shellfish and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain species of finfish that can accumulate scombrotoxin and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ciguatoxin, or whether other criteria should apply, as discussed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previously.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA invites comment on all these matters. FDA also invites  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment on the effect of a phase-in approach on the regulation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imports. How could this approach be applied to imported  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Deleting or Modifying Aspects of This Proposal, or Taking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some Other Step, to Reduce the Burden of Implementation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As has already been explained in this preamble, FDA has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed only the basics of HACCP in order to keep the regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burden to a minimum. Several features of HACCP included within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the NACMCF's seven principles, such as flow charts and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establishment of ``HACCP teams,'' are noted in this preamble, but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA has not proposed to require them. Nonetheless, FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acknowledges that, theoretically, there are a number of ways in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which this proposal could be scaled back even further. FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> invites comments on whether such scaling back would be desirable,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and, if so, how it could be done. Possible areas for scale-back  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include, but are not limited to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Requiring only negative, rather than positive records.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Negative records note only deviations from critical limits and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> how they are corrected. If a critical control point is under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control, no record is made. Admittedly, FDA has reservations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> about such an approach. For example, it is virtually impossible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for firms or for FDA to spot trends that could lead to problems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if only negative records are being kept. Nonetheless, FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> invites comment on this approach.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

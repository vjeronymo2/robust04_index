			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Letter: Silver lining of Nadir's departure Sir, Your leader on Mr Asil Nadir's departure ('Jumping bail', April 6) takes a too gloomy view. Having regard to earlier trials, it was always reasonable to assume that Mr Nadir's prosecution would go the same way. That the almost inevitable fiasco has occurred sooner rather than later may cast a cloud over the Temple but UK taxpayers will benefit from the silver lining. At least another Pounds 30m will be saved and there is even a prospect of a rebate of Pounds 3.5m] David Lang, 6 Cornwall Road, Dorchester, Dorset DT1 1RT</p>

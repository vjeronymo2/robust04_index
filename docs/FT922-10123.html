			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / The dream of steam that nearly drowned: An epic - and ultimately tragic - 19th century voyage to chart the mighty Euphrates river IT WAS a remarkable story of two 19th century visionaries, one a novelist, the other a soldier. Their dream was of a steamboat expedition down the uncharted Euphrates river: a voyage to match the great achievements of ancient Greece and Rome. Two paddle-steamers would be built in England, shipped in parts to the Syrian shore, transported overland by hundreds of camels or oxen to the upper reaches of the mighty river, and assembled on its banks. The expedition, the first full British survey of the Euphrates, was to bring tragedy, as described in a new book by John Guest*. First, the two men and their vision. Thomas Love Peacock - a tall, handsome, novelist friend of the poet Shelley - worked for the East India Company. He believed the Euphrates could be a commercial route from Britain to India. His associate was Francis Chesney, a small, wiry artillery officer-turned-explorer who believed strongly that nothing was impossible. Later, he was to be hailed by some as the father of the Suez Canal. The Euphrates expedition was not simply the dream of two men. It was an attempt by the British government to achieve a geo-political end by technological means. The objective was to halt Russian expansion in the near east, which was seen as a threat to India. The instrument was to be a flotilla of iron-hulled paddle-steamers that would patrol the Euphrates from the Anatolian mountains to the Persian Gulf. Peacock was a classical scholar. He knew that, more than 1,500 years earlier, the Roman emperors Trajan and Julian had led flotillas of flat-bottomed craft down the Euphrates as far as Babylon in support of their campaigns. In 1829, Peacock sent a memorandum to Lord Ellenborough, president of the India Board, expressing his fear that a foreign power might threaten Britain's interests by repeating the emperors' triumphs. Ellenborough decided there should be a feasibility study of the Euphrates route. Chesney, already 41, was chosen. He completed his survey in September 1832, and met Peacock for the first time in January 1833. His diary records: 'I found that he (Peacock) was deeply versed in the ancient history of the Euphrates and that he had not only been the first to bring this line of communication with India forward, but that he had collected in a thick book every private notice he could find of that river, whether contained in Gibbon, Balbi, or any other work.' The two decided to suggest a trial expedition. By late 1834, the dream of the great river journey was about to come true. Guest writes: 'A plan of action had already been prepared. Two iron vessels would be built and tried out in England; six months after placing the order, they should be ready to be shipped off in frame. The larger one would measure 100 tons and would be powered by two 25hp engines, while the smaller, designed for the low-water season, would measure between 60 and 70 tons with two 8hp engines. 'If they were shipped to the Syrian coast, as Chesney recommended, the voyage would take about 50 days. Five days would be required for unloading the crates and tracking them up the Orontes to a point near Antioch, whence camels and heavy wagons could transport the entire 300-ton load in three journeys to Bir, only 50 miles distant, in a week. 'Allowing 40 days to reassemble the vessels, the initial 1,100-mile trip down the Euphrates, which would also require time for negotiations with the Arabs and for laying down coal depots, should bring them to Basra a month later - for a total elapsed time of 131 days after leaving England. 'The return trip upstream to Bir was estimated at eight to 10 days. Thereafter, for the duration of the experiment, assumed to be 12 months, regular trips would take eight days to go up-river and five days to go down.' Orders for the steamers were placed with Lairds of Birkenhead. By the end of 1834, the impatient Chesney had named the ships Tigris and Euphrates, abandoned the idea of sea trials, and begun to organise the packing. He chartered the 390-ton George Canning to transport the vessels, and loading was completed by February 1 1835. On February 10, the journey began. By April, it had reached the Bay of Antioch. Chesney, impatient as ever, decided to assemble the smaller steamboat, the Tigris, and to test it on the Orontes river. Riveters, smiths and carpenters were put to work. Two weeks later it was launched. But it steered badly in the shallow waters of the river, and Chesney decided to unship the paddles and drag the hull overland in several pieces to the Euphrates. Guest writes: 'The expedition's carpenters and smiths, helped by local artisans and using lumber from the area, started work on building wagons to carry the heavier loads over the hills. 'Oxen had for centuries provided the power to move things overland, but many of the bullocks, procured with much difficulty, were ill-adapted to team work. The most effective means of traction proved to be a combination of human and animal power.' It took several weeks for the parts of the Tigris and Euphrates to be dragged to Port William, south of Bir on the upper reaches of the river. By autumn, after much activity, the larger of the two ships was almost ready. The Euphrates was launched on September 26, sliding sideways down a 25ft slope. By now, though, Chesney had caught malaria. The weather was worsening and it became clear that a voyage down the river would not be possible during the winter. It looked as if the dream might fall apart. But by spring 1836, the outlook had improved: Chesney was somewhat better and the Tigris had been launched. It set off downstream on May 4, followed by the Euphrates on May 8. The journey proved worse than anyone could have imagined. Within days, the two steamers were hit by a violent storm. Witnesses said it lasted only 12 minutes; yet, the Tigris was wrecked. Guest records: 'In pitch darkness, almost on its beam ends, the Tigris drifted down the river with water pouring through the windows, which nobody could close. The engineer remained at his post and two other men struggled vainly with the windows, while the rest of the ship's company gathered in silence on the after-deck.' The order to stand fast was given, but most of those huddled on the deck were unprepared when the Tigris sank suddenly in 30ft of water. One of the crew recalled 'being balanced on the awning ropes, with a native holding my feet and screaming piteously.' Twenty of the 37 people on board died. On May 24, Chesney told his remaining crew that he had received orders to disband the expedition by the end of July. Despite that, he was determined, if his colleagues agreed, to continue the descent of the river. 'Predictably, Chesney's appeal was effective. 'One and all,' he records, 'officers and men at once expressed themselves not only ready but anxious to second me in every way, and volunteered to forego their expedition pay in order to lessen our expenses as much as possible'.' On June 19 1836, 91 days after leaving Bir, the Euphrates steamed down the Shatt-al-Arab waterway. By now, crates and barrels were being used to eke out the fuel supply. It anchored at Basra, within sight of the Persian Gulf, at noon: almost journey's end. After a brief rest, Chesney took the Euphrates up the Tigris to complete his survey of the two rivers. But his epic journey was to be in vain. Six years later, in 1842, a report to a House of Commons committee, based on the experiences of the Euphrates, declared the river 'not well adapted for the purposes of steam navigation.' Peacock, his dream in ruins, resumed writing essays and reviews, including his reminiscences of Shelley. But he never wrote of the project that he had conceived, promoted and observed for years. He died in 1866, aged 80. For Chesney, the hot-headed visionary, the dream of the great river never died. He returned to the Euphrates and become associated with abortive projects to build a railway up the valley. He died in 1872, aged 83. *The Euphrates Expedition, by John S.

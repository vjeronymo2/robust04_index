			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Arts: Christie's magic with the fairies - Off the Wall / Dadd's record may not mean a Victorian revival WELL, Christie's pulled it off. In spite of a whacking estimate of up to Pounds 1.5m. it managed to sell Richard Dadd's painting, 'Contradiction', for Pounds 1.65m. yesterday, a record for any Victorian picture. Dadd painted the famous oval canvas of Oberon and Titania arguing about the changeling boy over four years. He had plenty of time: he was locked up in Bedlam for the murder of his father who he mistook for the Devil. One of the most famous of fairy pictures it nicely mirrors the ups and downs in demand for Victorian art. In 1870, a decade or so after it was completed, it was valued at 136 guineas. In 1964 Thomas Laughton, brother of the more famous Charles, sold it for Pounds 7,000. By 1983, just as the mania for Victorian art was approaching its peak, it made Pounds 550,000, at Sotheby's, to the American corporate collector Myron Kunin, at the time a record price for a work of the period. Yesterday the buyer was the dealer Jackie King and it would be surprising if her client was British. Another big export row is on the cards. The Dadd is so unusual that it is hardly typical of the Victorian market, which has been very depressed recently. Christie's sale totalled almost Pounds 3.5m. with over 81 per cent sold. One of the most famous icons of the period, Luke Filde's 'The village wedding', showing the happy couple parading down the street followed by villagers, hung, in print form, in a million homes. It was on target yesterday at Pounds 275,000. The work was much admired in its day and sold for 1,095 guineas in 1886. By 1982 it had sunk to Pounds 38,500, and proved a good buy. Two other paintings reflect the changing fortunes of Victorian art. Edward Ward's weepy 'Last parting of Marie Antoinette and her Son' was regarded as the ultimate in Victorian sentimentality when it was offered at Christie's in 1957. It sold for ten guineas. Yesterday it found a new owner at Pounds 104,500. And Evelyn Waugh was obviously a man before, rather than behind, his time. He collected Victorian paintings when they went for peanuts and owned 'The Upset Flower Cart' by W W Atkinson. After his death it fetched a paltry Pounds 770 in 1971. Yesterday it was valued at Pounds 66,000. Dealers in Victorian art should have been pleased at the success of the sale but many were hoping for a poor result which would publicly reduce expectations and prices. Only then, they feel, will buyers for anything but celebrated images be tempted back. On Monday the London Mozart Players will be performing at the Fairfield Hall in Croydon in a concert sponsored by Nestle UK. Nothing remarkable about that. Fairfield Hall is the home of the LMP and Nestle is its big backer. But the concert is an omen. In September a recording of the concert will be transmitted on Thames TV. It will be introduced by Peter Blackburn, chairman of Nestle. Sponsored arts programmes will have arrived in the UK. As well as a plug for the company in the credits the hour long programme will carry a commercial break replete with commercials for Nestle brands. The deal has been put together by Something of Consequence, a company which specialises in making sponsored performing arts programmes. The Ashes must be at the heart of one of the most romantic of sporting stories. An Australian victory in the Test; the ceremonial burning of the bails; the departure abroad with the relic entombed in a vase; their rare return to the UK when the English score a cricket win, only to be hidden in the holy of holies at Lord's, away from the public gaze. But this autumn the Ashes should be on view (insured for Pounds 1m.) at an exhibition of sporting trophies at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, along with around 500 prizes of historic, decorative, or amusing interest. The show is the inspiration of Lord Burghesh, whose grandfather mounted a similar exhibition in the 1930s. So great is his commitment that he has pledged Pounds 1m towards its success. Where do stocks come from, apart from brokers? From sticks, of course. That is how the word originated, back in the 12th century. The Royal Exchequer cut tally sticks from trees on the banks of the Thames near Westminster. When a deal was done a stick was split down the middle with each party keeping a perfectly matching half. Over the centuries the Exchequer accumulated millions of these totally redundant sticks. In 1834 it decided to make a bonfire of them all - and proceeded to burn down the old Palace of Westminster. Few tally sticks survived the conflagration, but Sotheby's is offering a group of 21, dating from the mid-13th century, on June 23. They were probably stolen from the blaze and are now estimated at up to Pounds 15,000. Among the payments inscribed along the sides are Pounds 6 13s 4d from the Abbot of Abingdon towards the knighting of Prince Edward, the son of King Henry III, and Pounds 3 6s 8d from John de Turbevil for contempt. There was obviously money in titles and libels even in those days. Rhetoric as an art form has been out of favour for the last few centuries but there are signs that it is making a come back. Companies seem prepared to pay good money to listen to the puppy politicians at the Oxford Union indulge in laboured speechifying. The Oxford debates have become an unlikely form of corporate entertain-ment. Last month Vanity Fair (wisely jetting in its own main speakers) organised a special debate on whether it was better to be governed by sinners rather than saints (the sinners won), and this week Time Magazine financed an arts versus science ding dong. It costs around Pounds 1,500 to back a debate in the autumn term, with an audience of 1,400 students crowding in, nearer Pounds 500 in the exam infested summer term, and, whatever the corporate guests think about it all, the companies get the chance for some discreet head hunting over the dinner.</p>

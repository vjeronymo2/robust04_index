			<p>941201 FT  01 DEC 94 / Brussels' answer to slow payers The European Commission yesterday proposed that member states introduce laws giving businesses the right to charge interest on late payment of trade debts. Representatives of small businesses believe the proposal will do much to banish the practice of late payments which strain the finances of Europe's small and medium-sized enterprises. Other recommendations for tackling the problem of late payments include a commitment to guarantee enterprises simple and cheap access to the courts and shortening the time in which government contracts are paid to a maximum of 60 days. The recommendations have yet to be presented to member states. Mr Raniero Vanni D'Archirafi, commissioner responsible for enterprise policy, said a wide consultation by the Commission had shown that late payments were at the root of serious problems for small enterprises struggling to balance their books, and that differences in national legislation constituted an obstacle to the smooth functioning of the single market.</p>

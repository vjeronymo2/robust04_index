			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: LME chairman in attack on 'malicious gossip' A SPIRITED defence of the London Metal Exchange's recent decision to intervene in its copper market after widespread complaints that the price was being manipulated upwards came last night from Mr Raj Bagri, the LME chairman. He said that mobility in international money markets and a massive increase in options and other derivatives activity 'makes it comparatively easy or tempting for one or more participants, individually or acting in concert, to create in any free market like ours such dominant positions so as to result in potentially undesirable situations or practices. We must be vigilant and ready to deal with such situations as and when the need arises.' Speaking at the LME's annual dinner, Mr Bagri suggested that some people, 'whose designs have been frustrated by firm actions of the LME board' might indulge in 'malicious gossip'. But he urged anyone who genuinely believed the board had acted with self-interested motives to furnish him with substantiated evidence 'because I am keen to ensure that, like our market, the LME board itself continues to meet the highest ethical standards'. Mr Bagri insisted the board believed in free markets 'but we also have a duty and obligation to run an orderly market and we are determined that the confidence reposed by the overwhelming majority of the metals trade and industry around the world in our reference prices continues to be justified and that these prices continue to be transparently and independently established without unwarranted distortions.' Mr Douglas Yearley. chairman of Phelps Dodge, the biggest US copper producer, said that, as a miner and producer of tangible material, he was uneasy about the use of derivatives, some of which were like 'echoes of shadows'. He said monitoring procedures could not keep pace with the fast growth in derivative activity 'and leaves us open to the potential, at least, of a meltdown'. Mr Yearley also provocatively suggested that in a few years the environmental movement would be more responsible for setting metal prices than the LME. 'The environmental movement's power is growing and that power is not going to be reversed in our lifetimes.' The demand for pristine, rather than simply reasonable, environmental standards 'is becoming a moral absolute in my country', he said. The 'not in my backyard' attitude towards mining was growing into 'not in your backyard either', he added, a change illustrated by the North American Free Trade Agreement, signed in August, which spelled out the standards and regulations on how Nafta countries must comply with environmental policy.</p>

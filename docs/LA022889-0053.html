			<p><P> February 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TELEVISION REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> 'COACH' NEEDS A GAME PLAN -- AND MORE LAUGHS  </P> <P> A network's ways can be mysterious.  </P> <P> "Coach" is finally coming off the bench. In what's being billed as a sneak  preview, the ABC comedy premieres at 9:30 tonight (on Channels 7, 3, 10 and  42), where it's expected to get a huge sampling following the hit "Roseanne."  "Coach" then reappears in its regular time slot at 9 p.m. Wednesday.  </P> <P> So far, so good, except that Wednesday's second episode is actually the pilot,  which sets up the series and tonight's first episode. So tonight's viewers will  be wondering why coach Hayden Fox (Craig T. Nelson) repeatedly groans about  being "new" to parenting. After all, his daughter Kelly (Clare Carey) is 18.  </P> <P> Wednesday's episode will explain that Hayden is a divorcee, and that Kelly only  recently has come to live with her father while attending Minnesota State  college, where he is football coach.  </P> <P> What "Coach" needs even more than a game plan, however, are laughs.  </P> <P> Tonight, in an episode nearly as inept as the Screaming Eagles he coaches,  Hayden goes berserk when he learns that Kelly has a date with a middle-aged  professor. There are some nice moments between Hayden and his doltish assistant  (Jerry Van Dyke), but nothing to compensate for an otherwise witless story  burdened by hackneyed, brain-versus-brawn characters.  </P> <P> Although no rocket, Wednesday's episode is stronger and funnier than tonight's,  injecting at least some nuance and amusement into this dormant father-daughter  relationship. Meanwhile, Hayden gets romantic with a TV newscaster (Shelley  Fabares).  </P> <P> The cast performs intelligently, but deserves better material. For "Coach," not  a championship season.

			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / TV-am joins bidding for Channel 5: Daily Telegraph group and Time Warner in deal TV-am, the UK commercial breakfast broadcaster, has joined Time Warner and Mr Conrad Black's Daily Telegraph group to create a consortium to bid for Channel 5. Mr Bruce Gyngell, chairman of TV-am, is to be the chairman of the new consortium to be called The Entertainment Channel and based at TV-am's London headquarters. The new grouping could pose a serious threat to the other declared bidders for Channel 5 including Mr Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest and Five TV, the company backed by Mr Moses Znaimer, founder of City TV in Toronto. TV-am, which lost its franchise in last year's competitive tenders for new broadcasting licences, took the decision to be involved in a Channel 5 bid at a board meeting on Monday night. Bids for Channel 5 have to be sent to the Independent Television Commission by July and broadcasting has to begin by the beginning of 1995. The new channel will be able to cover about three quarters of the UK population. The ITC has warned it will not award the licence unless a satisfactory solution is found to the problem of retuning. The winner has to pay for the retuning of around 3m video recorders which will suffer interference from the new channel. 'One of the significant things about our consortium is that we have British Telecom to carry out the retuning,' Mr Gyngell said last night. BT make 40,000 home visits a day and Mr Gyngell believes trusted, experienced people will be needed to carry out the work. Mr Jeremy Fox, an independent producer, is to be chief executive of the venture and the franchise application will be written by Mr David Keithley, head of public affairs at TV-am. The Entertainment Channel would offer a national service but have some local programming. The presence of Time Warner, the world's largest media group, and Mr Black, who has made it clear he wants to increase his interests in television, will make The Entertainment Channel a very serious bidder. Applicants must pass a quality threshold - which includes retuning - and in most circumstances the licence will then go to the highest bidder. The channel will be run as a publisher-broadcaster - most programmes will be commissioned rather than made in-house. Most estimates suggest at least Pounds 200m is needed to successfully launch Channel 5 against competition from commercial and satellite television.</p>

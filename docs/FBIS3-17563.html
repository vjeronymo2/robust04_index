			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: Reports by </F> Diplomatic Correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev,  Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others]    [Text] Tbilisi is inclined to deploy Russian peacekeeping  forces in Georgia even outside the frameworks of the UN  operation. "It is impossible to solve the Abkhazian conflict  without introduction of peacekeeping forces into Georgia,"  Georgian Foreign Minister Aleksandre Chikvaidze declared at a  press conference on Friday in Moscow.    In his words, this issue was being discussed during the  recent visit of the head of the Georgian state Eduard  Shevardnadze to New York. It was also discussed in Paris where  Shevardnadze met with the UN General Secretary Butrus-Ghali.    Chikvaidze pointed out that deployment of the UN  peacekeeping  forces and all preparatory operations will take three months.  "But the time goes on and forces should be introduced as soon as  possible. We hope for Russia. The thing is that Russia does  not want to undertake anything unilaterally. It's quite clear  because if Moscow coordinates its actions with the UN then this  organization will finance peacemaking operations of the Russian  troops," said Chikvaidze.    In his words, it is necessary to work out a mechanism  providing for the return of 300,000 Georgian refugees to  Abkhazia. "The presence of such a large amount of refugees  creates a tense situation in Georgia and even changes the  mentality of the people," said Chikvaidze. "The Abkhazian  separatism can make a negative imprint on the situation in other  countries, in Russia as well."    Responding to our Interfax correspondent, Chikvaidze  underlined that Georgia is ready to discuss political status of  Abkhazia within Georgia. "I do not know how it would look like,  but I can say for sure that Abkhazia will loose nothing minding  what it possessed earlier in the sphere of its sovereignty. Now  it should determine its position as soon as possible and to  develop the country's Constitution together with the leaderships  of Georgia, South Ossetia, and other autonomies, according to  which we shall be able to live," said Chikvaidze.    In response to another question Chikvaidze said that NATO's  Partnership for Peace program testifies to the fact that this  organization "is looking for a new role." "The confrontation  between military blocks sank into oblivion and NATO should find  its ecological screen. This organization should either acquire  new function or disband," said he.    In Chikvaidze's opinion, the mechanism of Partnership for  Peace program implementation "has not been developed till the  very end." "If one knocks at the door and asks NATO forces to  bring order in Georgia, it will not happen. However, we still  do not loose hope that in the future the Partnership for Peace  concept will actually help to increase efficiency of peacemaking  operations," he concluded.</p>

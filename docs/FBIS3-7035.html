Noting that the South Korean workers now are subsisting on  unprecedented-in-scale starvation wages due to the Kim Yong-sam  group's anti-popular labor policy and wage-curbing steps, the  white paper cites concrete facts proving this.    According to the white paper, the wages conditions of South  Korean workers can be seen graphically in the size of their  nominal wages per hour which are a meagre one-eighth or  one-ninth of those in Western countries and far below those of  the workers in Asian capitalist countries.    The wages gap between workers in South Korea is very wide,  depending on their schooling and sex.    A South Korean university professor said the difference  between uneducated workers and university graduates in terms of  income was in a ratio of 1 to 37 in case of men and 1 to 54 in  case of women.    Wages of South Korean female workers account for only 42.6  percent of male workers.    The proportion of women among the young workers aged between  13 and 29 in South Korea is 58 percent. Mainly engaging  themselves in the fibre, shoemaking, toymaking and electronic  industries, women are forced to slave labor of 12 to 16 hours a  day on low monthly wages of 300,000 or 400,000 won.    Worse still, South Korean workers have to do extra-hour work  for three or five days a week, yet not a few workers are paid  less than the "minimum wages" fixed by the puppets in the "Labor  Law".    Their wages are far below the minimum living cost and, to  make matters worse, they have to pay most of the meagre wages in  taxes, instead of using them to keep the pot boiling.    At present, more than 200 kinds of taxes are levied upon the  workers in South Korea. Even according to data released by the  puppet authorities, the rate of tax burdens in South Korea rose  to 20.2 percent in 1994 from 16.5 percent of 1986, and the  amount of tax burdens per head of the population increased to  1,316,000 won in 1994 from 1,125,000 won of 1993. In case of a  family of five they have to pay 6.58 million won per annum in  taxes.    The workers' wages in South Korea are too insignificant  compared with the annually rising commodity prices. A South  Korean newspaper reported that the rate of the jump of consumer  prices in the 1983-93 period was not 68.7 percent published by  the authorities but five times higher than that.    House purchasing prices in South Korea are five to six times  those in the United States and Japan which are believed highest  in the world.    If a wage-earner with a monthly pay of 400,000 won is to buy  a flat of 20 phyong (one phyong equals six feet square), he has  to save his wages for more than 50 years, neither eating nor  spending.    South Korean primary school children must pay more than  820,000 won, middle school pupils 970,000 won and high school  students 1,230,000 won annually. Besides, there are  miscellaneous fees of various names they have to pay monthly,  which run into hundreds of thousands of won. Most of the  workers who want their children to go to high school or  university have to make them do their own cooking. In this  case, monthly charges for a boarding room alone amount to  310,000 to 370,000 won.    The South Korean workers today are suffering from chronic  occupational diseases and all kinds of illness as they are  forced into high-intensity labor for long hours under coarse  work conditions.    In South Korea a medical examination costs 5,000 won, and a  medical checkup for antigen, electrocardiogram and the stomach  consumes respectively 8,000, 8,500 and 13,000 won. Charges for  an operation on the stomach are 300,000 won, an operation on  appendicitis 100,000 won, and a cornea transplanting operation  180,000 won. When hopitalized, a patient must pay more than  10,000 won a day, excepting the cost of medicines.    When all this is taken into consideration, the South Korean  workers' wages account for less than one fourth of the actual  cost of living.    This notwithstanding, the comprador businesses under the  patronage of the ruling quarters frequently go without paying  the small amount of wages of the workers for several months.  According to doctored figures published by the competent  authorities of South Korea, the unpaid wages of workers in South  Korea in recent years added up to 298.1 billion won.    The practice of "keeping wages in arrears" is getting all  the  more serious since the traitor Kim Yong-sam came to power.  According to data, 241 businesses in South Korea were keeping in  arrears wages to the tune of 58.1 billion won early this year.  This is five times the figure in the corresponding period of  1992. (South Korean newspaper TONGA ILBO, Feb. 4, 1994). The  South Korean newspaper HANGYORE SHINMUN predicted that the  "wages in arrears" would grow further due to the new regime's  "tough wage-curbing policy".    The Kim Yong-sam group is trying to enforce wage-curbing  measures like the "no work, no pay" system and the "total wages"  system, distorting the reality by arguing that the economic  crisis of South Korea resulted from the workers' struggle for a  higher pay. It is trying to justify its low wages policy with  the rhetoric of "economic rejuvination."    When labor-management disputes over the wages problem broke  out, the traitor Kim Yong-sam revealed his true class color,  contrary to his calls for "hardship sharing" and "common  destiny", by siding with the management and brandishing the  sword at the workers.    The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique vowed to make this year the  "first year" free of "labor-management disputes", openly  betraying its scheme to crack down brutally on the workers'  struggle for the right to live. This is an outspoken  declaration of war of the "civilian" fascist dictator against  the labor movement.    The traitor Kim Yong-sam has squandered money earned with  the  sweat and blood of workers in arms buildup. According to the  content of the 1994 "budgetary expenditures" finalized and  published by the South Korean "economic planning agency",  military spendings go far beyond 10,000 billion won, or up 9.6  percent from last year in scale. By contrast, the fund  earmarked for the "welfare of the working people" accounts for  less than one 300th of the military expenditures.    All this shows that the traitor Kim Yong-sam is a fascist  dictator, kingpin of plunder and war fanatic stepping up war  preparations by bleeding the laboring masses white with the  strong arm.    If the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique continues to suppress this  year the workers' struggle for their elementary right to live,  including their demand for a higher pay, at the point of the  bayonet, laying the blame for the economic bankruptcy of South  Korea at the door of the workers, it would result in  precipitating its own destruction.</p>

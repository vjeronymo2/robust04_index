			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Travel: Smart way to fly - Practical Traveller THE STORY two weeks ago about my magical mystery flight to Bali aboard Garuda, the hapless Indonesian state airline - we stopped four times and endured a door-to-door travelling time of 28 hours - has drawn a reply from Timothy Knight, managing director of Eastravel, writes Michael Thompson-Noel, Travel editor. Eastravel, an air travel consultant and organiser based in Ipswich, specialises in tailor-made holidays, especially to the Far East. Knight writes: 'Whilst I fully agree with your philosophy of ensuring the most direct or non-stop flight for a long-haul journey to a single destination, those flights on quality airlines which stop en route offer the opportunity to stop over, thus getting far better value for money and a chance to break up the journey into smaller sectors. 'For example, the journey undertaken by yourself to Indonesia could have been just a one-stop flight with Singapore Airlines, which Eastravel offers as a possible choice; or up to three stops flying with Emirates (the airline of the United Arab Emirates). The stops could be selected in either direction and then combined with Singapore Airlines' (one-stop) flight in the other. 'En route to Indonesia, Emirates offers Dubai and the Emirates with a choice of adventure and superb hotels; Sri Lanka, with possibly a chauffeur-driven tour; and then Singapore, a gateway to Malaysia. All these possibilities could be combined with an overland tour in Java ending finally (exhausted) in a Bali resort. 'Similar journeys can be organised to Japan and Korea, Australia and New Zealand, via numerous Oriental countries.' This is all quite true: the market in stop-over travel is large and growing. You can do virtually anything you want and stop anywhere you want, though you need a perspicacious travel agent to help you wade through the fine print and spot the best-value deals. As Timothy Knight acknowledges, my whinge was about the time taken on Garuda just to get to Bali. I didn't want to stop in Paris, Abu Dhabi, Singapore and Jakarta; but I did. If you are planning a single-destination long-haul holiday, try and get a non-stop flight. Failing that, insist on the most direct (fewest stops) flight available. You may encounter trickiness. Many airline staff use the word 'direct' to imply 'non-stop.' I have heard them do it time after time. Keep flying hours to the minimum. Do not patronise airlines that take you all round the houses for obscure reasons of their own. I used to have a rule that 15 hours' flying time was the maximum I would consider without a proper stop and rest. It sounds wimpy, but I plan to re-adopt it. If you fly for 20 hours or more you can suffer severe jet-smack, and that can spoil your holiday. If you can afford the time for genuine stop-overs and mini-breaks as a way of interrupting your journey, get some specialist brochures, including those of the airlines. Eastravel has its own.

Useful for would-be holiday litigants is Successful Holidays, And What To Do If They're Not, by Michael and Jacqui Welham, which serves three broad purposes. It decribes the parties involved in travel, from operators and agents to travel associations. It steers you towards holiday success with pointers and advice. And it explains the varied options for winning compensation if things go wrong. It offers numerous case histories, and describes the impact of the new EC directive on package holidays. There is a directory of addresses and telephone numbers for government offices, tourist boards, embassies, travel associations, airlines, vaccination centres, what have you.

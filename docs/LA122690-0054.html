			<p><P> December 26, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCENE ON THE STREET EAR THEY GO AGAIN  </P> <P> Some earrings make a whisper of a fashion statement. Single pearls. Teensy gold  hearts. Discreet silver circles. Heck, you pull off your sweater and you don't  even know if they're still in your ears or have burrowed into the cable stitch.  </P> <P> And then there are EARRINGS. These are fashion statements that carry across the  room -- some of them in a shout that's, well, almost earsplitting.  </P> <P> If you want to see EARRINGS, try the streets and malls of Pasadena and West  Covina, where they are much in evidence. And among the young, the dramatic  effect of one earring is duplicated, or in some cases enhanced, with one or  more earrings.  </P> <P> Women who believe that lobe makes the world go round put all the focus just on  one ear. And women who refuse to let fashion lead them by the nose can also  prove it. SYBIL BAKER  </P></p>

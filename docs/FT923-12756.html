It can also have therapeutic benefits, strengthening muscles suffering from inflammatory conditions, traumatic injuries or following surgery. Tec'hand, developed with the help of rock-climber Patrick Erdlinger and manufactured by Tecmachine of France, is the first exercise machine designed specifically for the hand and forearm. The portable machine works by eliciting controlled manual force and gripping actions and has safety features for weak muscles and tendons. Tecmachine: France, 77 36 56 27.</p>

Mexican officials voiced concern over the growing  trade imbalance in Seoul's favor and requested that South Korea  lift restrictions on importing Mexican liquor, poultry and  fruit, ministry officials said.    Seoul raised the issue of the growing number of anti-dumping  investigations into Korean products in Mexico and asked for  assurance that the probes be unbiased. It also brought up  Mexican limits on quota imports and its customs tariffication  system, naming them as trade barriers.    South Korea pressed Mexico to reach early conclusion of an  investment protection accord to activate bilateral investment  activities but the Mexicans reacted negatively, officials said.    The two countries initialed a telecommunications cooperation  pact and agreed to hold talks in the near future while  scheduling maritime negotiations for mid-March.</p>

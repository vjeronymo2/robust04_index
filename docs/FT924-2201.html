			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Provisions could push Tarmac to deeper loss FURTHER evidence is emerging of the financial problems facing Tarmac, the UK's biggest housebuilder. The company is awaiting a management consultancy report which will add weight to losses forecast by some City analysts for 1992 of some Pounds 200m. The report, by accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand, is expected to arrive in the boardroom within a fortnight. It will concentrate on Tarmac's properties division, which contributed to a pre-tax loss of Pounds 15.1m in the first half of this year. On Friday, the construction group announced the resignation of Mr Tony Collins, the chief executive of the properties division. Tarmac said at the time of the interims in September it was scaling back its property side, and yesterday said Mr Collins, who joined the main board in 1989, would not be replaced. A spokesman for the company said of the Coopers analysis; 'It is not completed yet. The fact that there are going to be provisions is not new but the Coopers report will quantify those provisions. It is part of the new chief executive's thorough review of all aspects of the group.' The impact on the figures depends on whether the write-downs are included below or above the pre-tax line. Assuming they are above, some analysts believe the total deficit will be Pounds 200m with the most pessimistic going for Pounds 300m. Mr Mike Betts, a building materials and construction analyst with US investment bank Goldman Sachs, said he expected write-downs on housing and property to result in Tarmac 'declaring a substantial pre-tax loss this year of up to Pounds 200m.' That would compare with a 1991 profit of Pounds 21m after provisions. In September Tarmac said it was cutting the number of homes it builds by up to a fifth, pulling out of commercial property development and raising cash to cut debts by disposals.</p>

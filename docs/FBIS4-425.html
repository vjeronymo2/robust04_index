			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with James Ruego, RPF representative in Brussels, </F> by correspondent Linda Dewin; place not given -- recorded, in  French with superimposed translation into Dutch]    [Text] [Announcer] How close are the Rwandan Patriotic  Front [RPF] rebels to Kigali? Linda Dewin put this question to  the RPF representative in Brussels, James Ruego.    [Ruego] The Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] is 2 km from the  capital. There is information of two battalions of 4,000  soldiers each.    [Dewin] Why are you not attacking?    [Ruego] Foreigners are still being evacuated, and the RPF  promised that it would allow them to leave and to be evacuated.    [Dewin] Is that not risky? Can the RPF continue waiting?    [Ruego] We want the evacuation to be finished. I have heard,  and this is very encouraging, that all foreigners might be gone  from here within the next 24 hours.</p>

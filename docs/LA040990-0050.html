			<p><P> April 9, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 2 MILES OF SHORE ARE REOPENED  </P> <P> A two-mile stretch of coastal waters in Long Beach was re-opened Sunday after  tests revealed that the previously contaminated waters were safe, officials  said.  </P> <P> But about two additional miles remained off limits pending the results of  tests.  </P> <P> Swimming, fishing, surfing and all forms of water contact had been prohibited  in all of Long Beach's coastal waters since Friday, when officials found  abnormally high levels of the bacteria coliform in the water, said Dick Smith,  the city's hazardous waste operations officer.  </P> <P> Officials speculated that the contamination may have been caused by runoff from  the Los Angeles River.  </P> <P> "When we have heavy amounts of precipitation like we had last week, we will  have these elevated counts," Smith said.  </P> <P> The beaches in Alamitos Bay and south of Belmont Pier were reopened Sunday, but  those north of the pier and into the downtown Marina -- about two miles --  remained closed pending test results expected today, Smith said.  </P> <P> Marion Johnson of the Long Beach Department of Health and Human Services said  coliform, a bacteria that indicates fecal contamination, could cause illness in  those who inadvertently swallow ocean water.  </P> <P> "It really would depend on how much water the person swallowed, but (coliform)  could cause diarrhea or stomach cramps," Johnson said.  </P> <P> The contaminated water did not prevent some from enjoying a Sunday afternoon on  the beach. Many biked, jogged and flew kites along the coastline and officials  expected a crowd of 15,000 to turn out for an annual beach festival at the  Shoreline Aquatic Park.  </P></p>

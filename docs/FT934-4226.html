			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Finance in the Family: Borrowers pay more - Mortgages / The Budget and You Building societies generally were relieved that Tuesday's Budget eroded rather than killed mortgage tax relief. On top of the cut in Miras (mortgage interest relief at source) from 25 to 20 per cent in April 1994, chancellor Kenneth Clarke announced a further reduction to 15 per cent from April 1995. Each change is expected to cost borrowers Pounds 10 a month on a mortgage of Pounds 30,000 or more. Home income plans will not, however, be affected by the lowering of tax relief on mortgage interest. The Treasury made clear that tax relief on interest paid to allow elderly people to buy life annuities will continue to be available at 25 per cent. Lenders are not rushing to pass on the pre-Budget base rate cut to borrowers. Lloyds bank has announced a cut in its standard rate from January for existing borrowers, taking it to 7.74 per cent from 7.99 per cent. The lead in announcing mortgage rate cuts was taken by the Nationwide building society and National Westminster bank, which said on the day of the base rate reduction that they would cut their standard variable rate to 7.74 per cent from 7.99. Nationwide added that the reduction meant a saving of Pounds 6.67 a month for those borrowers with a repayment mortgage of Pounds 50 000. Their move was followed later that week by announcements from the National &amp; Provincial, Newcastle and Northern Rock. The latter moved in expectation of a further small base rate cut, dropping its base rate for new loans to 7.65 per cent from 7.99. But others such as the Alliance &amp; Leicester, the fourth largest society, are intending to wait for a further reduction before making any changes. Other lenders are likely to move between now and the new year, when new rates announced already will apply to existing borrowers. A further reason for caution in moving on variable rates, however, could be the societies' desire to know more about the government's plans for the new guaranteed income bond for people over 65 before deciding what rates they can offer, to savers as well as to borrowers. Even if some variable rates do not change in this period, new ranges of fixed-rate mortgages are likely to become available. Abbey National, the UK's second largest mortgage lender, yesterday launched a new range of fixed-rate loans for first-time buyers and other customers. Rates for the latter vary between 6.39 per cent (apr 6.7) until April 1996 to 7.89 per cent (apr 8.3) to April 2001. Booking fees are Pounds 50-Pounds 300; redemption penalties range from 60 to 210 days' interest. The loans are available with any repayment method and Abbey does not insist that customers take out compulsory insurance. Bradford &amp; Bingley building society is offering a rate of 6.45 per cent (apr 6.7), fixed until end-January 1997, for those wanting to move or re-mortgage. The booking fee is Pounds 250, or 0.25 per cent for loans over Pounds 100,000, and no conditional purchases are required.</p>

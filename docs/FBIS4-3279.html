			<p>BFN     [Text] New York, April 19 (XINHUA) -- Sino-U.S. trade has  made satisfying progress despite of conflicts, Wu Yi, visiting  Chinese minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation  (MOFTEC) said here today.    Presenting a key-note speech at the Asia Society this  morning, Wu noted that trade between China and the United States  increased by 20 percent annually.    Despite the troubles and conflicts in the process of  Sino-U.S. trade and economic relations, the general trend has  been developing and going forward, she added.    According to the minister, the two way trade between China  and the United States valued at 27.65 billion U.S. dollars,  increasing 11-folds over 1979 and the U.S. by far was the  largest investor in China with committed investment of 11  billion dollars in over 10,000 projects.    "It is worth noting that about 50 of the fortune 500  companies have made investment in China and their investment  tend to be large in size and have higher level of technology  content," Wu said at the China-U.S. trade and investment seminar.    On the most favored nations (MFN) status, a topic concerned  by all, Wu stressed that there was no problem on the part of  China, but the U.S. annual review on China's MFN status had  added considerable uncertainty to the business communities in  the two countries.    While praising more and more Americans of vision who were in  favor of de-coupling human rights with MFN, Wu expressed her  hope that reason would prevail so that this issue could be  solved once and for all.    "If otherwise the basis for Sino-U.S. trade and economic  relations were ruined, both sides would suffer, the biggest  loser would not be China, but rather U.S. business community and  the vast U.S. consumers," she emphasized.    Economies of the two countries were very complementary to  each other, Wu said, adding that to develop trade and economic  relationships between the two countries was not only in the  fundamental interest of the two nations, but also beneficial to  the prosperity and stability of the Asia-Pacific region and  throughout the world.    Ye Qing, vice chairman of China's State Planning Commission  and Jiao Sufen, director general of the Department of Foreign  Investment of MOFTEC, also made speeches on business  opportunities in China.    About 300 people, most of whom are businessmen from U.S. big  companies, attended the seminar.</p>

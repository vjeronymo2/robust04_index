			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: WEST HOLLYWOOD;  </P> <P> VOTE DELAYED ON RANGERS  </P> <P> The City Council postponed a vote to hire two park rangers to patrol the city's  parks.  </P> <P> The Human Services Commission asked the council to consider hiring the park  rangers to enhance park security.  </P> <P> But several West Hollywood residents argued against the plan, saying the  $75,000 cost of hiring the rangers was too high. A city report states that  crime has decreased in the parks since the Sheriff's Department began using  foot patrols to enforce anti-camping laws four months ago.  </P></p>

			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / New Forth road bridge could open by 2000 A SECOND road bridge across the Firth of Forth could be built by the end of the century, Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, said yesterday. Mr Lang announced that a feasibility study will be conducted into building a privately funded bridge alongside the existing Forth road bridge with associated road links. A scheme for a rapid transit system linking the bridge and Edinburgh airport with the centre of the city will also be considered. Several construction companies have already indicated that they are interested in building the new bridge and the new roads. The government envisages that both projects would be funded from tolls levied on the existing and the new Forth road bridges. The new bridge would cost about Pounds 275m to build. New roads linking the bridges with the existing Edinburgh bypass and the M9 motorway, as well as improvements to the M90 on the north side of the crossing, would cost about Pounds 100m, Mr Lang said. The Scottish Office also proposes that British Rail build new stations both on the north side of the crossing in Fife and on the south side to improve rail traffic across the Forth. Mr Lang said that tolls on the bridges would be set at the equivalent of the 2s 6d levied when the first road bridge was opened in 1964. That would mean a toll at today's prices of Pounds 1.25 compared with the present actual toll of 40p. The toll on the present bridge might be increased while construction of the new bridge was under way to help finance the new project and to deter unnecessary journeys across the existing bridge, where capacity will be exhausted by the end of the century. Miller Group, the Edinburgh-based construction company, announced that it was forming a consortium with John Laing and GTM-Entrepose of France to bid for the contract to build the bridge and the associated roads. Bank of America would arrange finance. Construction groups Balfour Beatty and Trafalgar House, with Kleinwort Benson, the merchant bank, are also understood to be considering bidding for the project. Other construction groups expected to be interested include Sir Robert McAlpine and Tarmac. Trafalgar House and Kleinwort were partners on the privately financed Dartford toll bridge across the River Thames and are working on the privately financed Birmingham northern relief road. John Laing and GTM Entrepose are jointly building a privately financed Severn bridge. Observers believe that about six or seven groups may bid for the contract. The Scottish Office would select the winner from a shortlist of three. Mr Lang implied that completing the project by 2000 was optimistic, although it could be done if the feasibility studies were completed in two to three years, and the bridge built in four years. The government's announcement that it favoured a second road bridge brought a mixed reaction. The regional council in Fife welcomed the move as crucial to the region's economic interests. But Edinburgh district council said that a second Forth road bridge would be 'an environmental disaster for Edinburgh, west Lothian and the south of Fife'. It would do nothing to relieve traffic congestion but add to it by encouraging more people to cross the Forth, the council said. Mr Lang said that a new road bridge was necessary and that extra demand on the crossing could not be met just by increasing rail capacity. The present bridge, built to carry 14,000 vehicles a day, carried more than 50,000 cars on each of 100 days surveyed last year, mainly during peak periods such as the summer holiday season. Traffic increased by 5 per cent in 1992 in spite of the recession, the Scottish Office said.</p>

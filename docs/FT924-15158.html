			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Aegis plans to cancel its market listings in New York and Paris AEGIS, the media buying group, is cancelling its listings in Paris and New York with effect from October 30. Aegis has analysed trading in its shares for the first eight months of 1992 and found that more than 99 per cent of all trading volume was conducted in London. 'London is where all the liquidity is, where all the institutions want to deal, whatever their nationality. All our banking and brokering arrangements are in London, so London seemed the logical place for the company to be listed,' the company said. Aegis estimated that the withdrawal would mean annual savings of more than Pounds 250,000. The delisting puzzled some analysts yesterday . Aegis' shares have collapsed from more than 200p a year ago to 17p yesterday. 'It's a thoroughly negative move. With the company's decision to relocate its headquarters from London to Paris, it was more important to develop the French listing rather than get rid of it,' said one.</p>

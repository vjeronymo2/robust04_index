			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / London Stock Exchange: Equities drift lower in poor volume ANOTHER unimpressive trad-ing session in London saw equities give back the gains of the previous day, discouraged by corporate developments and the less certain trend on Wall Street. Interest rate optimism found fresh support from sterling's continued firmness, as well as from a cut in mortgage rates by Nationwide Anglia, second largest of the UK building societies; but over-enthusiasm was checked by a warning from the Governor of the Bank of England against reading too much into the recent drop in the headline inflation rate in the UK. Once again, the chief feature was the low level of business in the equity market. Not since the middle of last month has daily retail volume in equities reached the Pounds 1bn mark regarded as the minimum for a healthy, and profitable, trading session in the London market. Seaq-recorded volume, which takes in both retail and intra market business and is therefore a somewhat unreliable guide to the level of genuine investment business, reached only 387.9m shares yesterday, compared with 431.2m on Tuesday, when turnover was swollen by the large placing of shares in Saatchi &amp; Saatchi. The return to low trading volumes since the end of March has been discomforting for London-based securities houses, and has been reflected this week in further cutbacks in staff at City firms. The first quarter of the year, when the London equity market showed one of the highest levels of total return for the past decade, according to Barclays de Zoete Wedd, had also been accompanied by a substantial improvement in volumes. However, there were indications yesterday that the institutions still have heavy cash balances ready to commit when suitable situations offer themselves. In addition to their ready response to the Dollars 1.35bn purchase of the North Sea assets of Occidental Petroleum by Enterprise Oil and Elf Aquitaine, the big players took up the outstanding tap stock issue in the gilt-edged market. It was also disclosed that 89 per cent of the Pounds 96m recent rights issue from Morgan Crucible had been taken up, and the rump of 4.7m shares placed in the market; this was considered a highly satisfactory outcome. The market was on the downside throughout yesterday's trading session, with attempts to rally repeatedly unsuccessful. A final downturn was featured by weakness in the international oil shares as the sector backed away ahead of today's trading statement from British Petroleum. Also unhelpful was Wall Street's weak start to its new trading session following reports that President Bush had suffered a further health problem. The final reading left the FT-SE Index at 2,523.4, the fall on the day of 17.1 virtually cancelling the advance of the previous session. Market strategists have read little into either day's market trend. Attention remained focused on the prospects for another half- point cut in UK base rates at the end of next week, when the April retail price index will provide the latest evidence on UK inflation levels. Once again, investors played closer attention to individual company statements than to the overall trend of the market. A maintained interim dividend from Trafalgar House, the construction, property and shipping group, removed one market uncertainty. However, SmithKline Beecham, the pharmaceuticals group, closed lower after erratic price movement in spite of interim results much in line with expectations.</p>

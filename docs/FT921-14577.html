			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Bank says Soviet debt delays temporary VNESHECONOMBANK, the bank responsible for servicing the former Soviet Union's debts, yesterday told western bankers to expect 'temporary interruptions' in the prompt payment of interest and repayment of principal in the months ahead. It added that it had every intention of bringing all payments up to date as soon as the necessary funds were available. The news, communicated at a meeting convened in Frankfurt at the request of the Vnesheconombank and the Russia central bank, was not as bad as some bankers had expected following remarks last week by Mr Georgy Matiukhin, head of the Russian central bank. He said then that Russia would be seeking a full deferral of interest payments at yesterday's meeting. This would have meant a serious breach of the agreement reached on December 17, when creditor banks agreed to an arrangement whereby Vnesheconombank would defer repayments of principle on certain types of debt for three months whilst continuing to pay interest. According to last night's statement from Deutsche Bank, co-ordinating the talks on behalf western creditors, Vnesheconombank yesterday emphasised that it was not abrogating last month's deal by making a unilateral suspension of interest. Vnesheconombank explained that new procedures to garner hard currency funds to service foreign debt had not yet come into full effect and that the former Soviet Union had liquidity problems. According to the Deutsche statement, the committee was informed that 'until the new measures were fully operational there may be temporary interruptions in the timely payment of interest' and certain other categories of debt not included in last month's agreement. The agreement covers only debt to private banks taken up before January 1 last year and due for repayment between December 5 last year and March 30, excluding public issues and bond placements as well as short-term debts and facilities. The statement said that Vnesheconombank's role as debt manager for the former Soviet Union would not be affected by the transfer of the bank's commercial activities to various Russian banks under a degree passed by the Russian parliament this week. Under the terms of that decree, the bank is likely to be split into three parts - one acting as an agency for foreign debt servicing, the second as an independent commercial bank, and the third being merged with Vneshtorgbank, the Russian foreign economic bank. Mr Matiukhin, the Russian central bank chairman, said yesterday there was no agreement between the republics on sharing the estimated Dollars 84bn Soviet debt between them, and that calculations about individual shares were 'very difficult, almost impossible: after all, these debts were accumulated in the course of 74 years (the Soviet period)'. He confirmed earlier indications that the bank and the Russian government intend to introduce a special rate - to be set at Rbs8-Rbs10 to the dollar - at which foreigners planning to buy shares in Russian enterprises would be required to change money. This would be far below the present market rate. Mr Matiukhin said that unless this was done, 'they (foreign investors) could buy everything at fantastically low prices'.</p>

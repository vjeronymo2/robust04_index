			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Fokker shares fall 24% after request for Fl 1bn loan SHARES in Fokker, the hard-pressed Dutch aircraft manufacturer, lost a quarter of their value on the Amsterdam bourse yesterday after the company said it had approached the Nationale Investeringsbank (NIB), the Dutch state-owned bank, for a loan of between Fl 800m and Fl 1bn (Pounds 377m). The move intensified fears that Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa), the aerospace subsidiary of Germany's Daimler-Benz group, was considering abandoning its plan to acquire a controlling stake in the Dutch company. It was also taken as a sign of mounting financial difficulties at Fokker. Fokker shares closed 24.4 per cent lower yesterday at Fl 10.20. The shares were also dragged down by concern over the collapse this week of Daf, the Dutch truckmaker. Although Dasa said yesterday it was still interested in taking control of Fokker, the German company is understood to be demanding a restructuring of the provisional agreement signed at the end of October, saying the Dutch group's financial and business position has deteriorated since then. Dasa agreed to pay DM800m (Pounds 340m) for a 51 per cent stake in the Dutch manufacturer of regional and commuter aircraft as part of its strategy to create a European regional aircraft consortium. But the German group is understood to believe that the capital injection from the Dutch authorities agreed under the original proposal is now insufficient. Dasa is anxious to avoid repeating with Fokker the embarrassment of having to refinance a company shortly after completing its acquisition as happened after it bought Dornier, the German aircraft maker. However, it is willing to increase its own capital commitment to the company if the Dutch government increases its cash support. The total capital required is believed to be in the region of Fl 400m. The Dutch government has indicated its willingness in principle to a change in the agreement, but Dasa's requirements may prove too onerous. Dasa is believed to be threatening to walk away from the deal if the transaction is not restructured. Dasa did not have access to all Fokker's accounts when it signed the original agreement. It is believed to have been particularly concerned about Fokker's backlog of unsold aircraft and has become worried about deterioration in the aircraft market. Dasa believes that Fokker's decision to seek the financing from the NIB confirms its own assessment of mounting financial difficulties. Fokker said yesterday that the request for a new loan would have been made irrespective of the outcome of negotiations with Dasa.</p>

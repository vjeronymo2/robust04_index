			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets: Istanbul begins to claw back losses Istanbul has begun to claw back some of the losses seen since the start of the year, although its volatility was reflected in a 5 per cent decline earlier this week. With the recent selling led by domestic investors, the international investment community has been keeping a watching brief on developments. Mr Barton Biggs, Morgan Stanley's director of global strategy, reckons the time has now come to re-enter the Turkish equity market. Consequently he has lifted the country's weighting in Morgan Stanley's emerging markets model portfolio to 10 per cent, against a benchmark of 2 per cent. 'The cause of the panic was a credit rating downgrade, a run on the currency, the resignation of the governor of the central bank, soaring short-term interest rates (the overnight rate reached 600 per cent at one point) and a loss of confidence in the prime minister,' he reiterates. 'The devaluation of the currency was mishandled, but necessary,' Mr Biggs goes on to say. Turkey suffered from a 70 per cent inflation rate last year, and this led to overvaluation of the lira. 'Naturally,' he concludes, 'exports stagnated and imports boomed, resulting in the trade deficit going from Dollars 7.7bn in 1992 to Dollars 13.8bn. 'The devaluation has restored Turkey's competitiveness, and the stock market should be going up, not down. I think it will once the crisis eases and short-term interest rates start falling.' Last week's biggest faller was Brazil, a trend that has been reversed this week.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EMERGING MARKETS: IFC WEEKLY INVESTABLE PRICE INDICES  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                Dollar terms                   No. of     Feb 18    % Change    % Change Market            stocks       1994   over week   on Dec '93  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Latin America Argentina           (25)   1,105.46        -0.0        +11.2 Brazil              (57)     322.07       -13.7        +38.4 Chile               (25)     663.91        +2.6        +20.3 Colombia1           (11)     929.40        +6.1        +44.2 Mexico              (70)   1,063.81        -3.4         +6.3 Peru2               (11)     159.03        +5.2        +31.5 Venezuela3          (11)     844.39        +6.9        +42.7 East Asia China4              (18)     129.50        +1.8        -13.2 South Korea5       (156)     127.36        +0.1         +7.8 Philippines         (18)     302.95        +0.9        -11.0 Taiwan, China6      (90)     130.21        -7.4         -3.7 South Asia India7              (77)     133.01        -1.7        +14.2 Indonesia8          (37)     117.53        -5.4         -5.7 Malaysia           (105)     277.10        -2.5        -18.3 Pakistan9           (15)     403.19        +3.5         +3.9 Sri Lanka10          (5)     241.75       +12.5        +36.4 Thailand            (55)     405.63        +2.1        -15.1 Euro/Mid East Greece              (25)     265.12        +2.7        +16.4 Hungary11            (5)     246.46        +2.8        +47.9 Jordan              (13)     171.82        +1.0         +3.8 Poland12            (12)   1,222.46       +10.1        +49.5 Portugal            (25)     136.43        +4.7        +19.9 Turkey13            (40)     168.21       +33.4        -20.9 Zimbabwe14           (5)     232.65        +4.0         +15.1  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                       Local currency terms                   No. of         Feb 18    % Change    % Change Market            stocks           1994   over week   on Dec '93  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Latin America Argentina           (25)     678,341.61        -0.0        +11.2 Brazil              (57)  255,982,991.3        -7.1       +151.9 Chile               (25)       1,137.38        +2.7        +19.3 Colombia1           (11)       1,344.77        +6.0        +45.1 Mexico              (70)       1,425.01        -3.4         +6.2 Peru2               (11)         211.03        +5.2        +32.7 Venezuela3          (11)       2,113.88        +6.9        +48.7 East Asia China4              (18)         142.30        +1.8        -13.3 South Korea5       (156)         135.67        +0.4         +8.1 Philippines         (18)         398.07        +0.9        -10.4 Taiwan, China6      (90)         129.15        -7.4         -3.5 South Asia India7              (77)         147.09        -1.7        +14.2 Indonesia8          (37)         135.00        -5.4         -5.2 Malaysia           (105)         284.49        -1.8        -15.6 Pakistan9           (15)         551.68        +3.5         +4.4 Sri Lanka10          (5)         258.53       +11.7        +35.4 Thailand            (55)         410.22        +2.1        -15.1 Euro/Mid East Greece              (25)         446.08        +1.0        +16.0 Hungary11            (5)         304.84        +3.3        +51.0 Jordan              (13)         249.54        +1.0         +4.2 Poland12            (12)       1,693.51        +9.5        +53.4 Portugal            (25)         162.84        +3.1        +17.9 Turkey13            (40)       1,407.78       +33.9         -3.2 Zimbabwe14           (5)         279.34        +1.6        +30.8  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Indices are calculated at end-week, and weekly changes are percentage movement from the previous Friday.

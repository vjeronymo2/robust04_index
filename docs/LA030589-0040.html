			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> West Germany's ecologist Greens party elected a new leadership at a meeting in  Duisburg, pledging to set aside internal struggles. The previous  radical-dominated leadership was ousted in December at a party congress, which  intensified a struggle between "fundamentalist" and "realist" factions. The  "fundis," as they are known, prefer direct protest action to parliamentary  cooperation. The party's "realo" wing urges cooperation with the opposition  Social Democratic Party to gain government office. The Greens elected as party  spokespersons a "fundis," a "realo" and a moderate. The party won 8.3% of the  vote in the 1987 federal election but has slipped in the polls since.  </P></p>

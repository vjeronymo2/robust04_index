According to reports from Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin,  Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Ningbo, many transnational corporations  have invested in local basic industry projects and high-tech  projects. Last year, more than 10 transnational corporations  launched investment projects in Beijing, and large projects  exceeding $10 million each numbered more than 200. Shanghai has  signed more than 200 project agreements with more than 120  transnational corporations. One-third of the world's 100  largest corporations have made investments in Shanghai. The  investment by transnational corporations in Ningpo exceeded $6  billion, and large projects exceeding $10 million each numbered  more than 40. The number and size of investment projects in  Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen also has increased  substantially.    In recent years, hundreds of internationally famous  transnational corporations made investments on the Chinese  mainland. These include Motorola, General Motors, IBM, Xerox,  Concord [xie he 0588 0735] Johnson and Johnson, Exxon, and  Morgan [mo gen 2302 2704], of the United states; Unilever and  Pilkington Brothers [pi er jin dun 4122 1422 6855 7319], of  Britain; Volkswagen and Simens, of Germany; Mitsubishi, Mitsui,  Sony, Seibu, Ito-chu, and Kumagai Gumi, of Japan; Bell, of  Belgium; Phillips, of the Netherlands; and Zhengda [2973 1129],  of Thailand; as well as some transnational corporations based in  Taiwan and Hong Kong. The transnational corporations that have  taken quick action first set up some small and  intermediate-sized enterprises and also sought new opportunities  for major investment projects. Many large corporations have  planned to launch major investment projects in the fields of  petroleum, car making, the chemical industry, and shipping, and  have worked out long- or intermediate-term investment plans.  For example, the three large oil companies -- Texaco, Shell,  and Exxon -- have participated in offshore oil development  projects in the East China Sea. A U.S. corporation planned to  invest 10 billion yuan in China's petrochemical industrial,  radio communications, and shipping projects. Japan's Mitsubishi  Heavy Industries and Kawasaki Heavy Industries, and the U.S.  Boeing Corporation have cooperated with China's aviation  industries in manufacturing YSX passenger planes. Hong Kong's  Hutchison Whampoa has invested over 10 billion yuan in  developing Shenzhen's Yantian Port and Shanghai's container  terminal.    The transnational corporations are making huge long-term  investments in China mainly because they are attracted by the  tremendous market potential and the lasting economic charm of  the Chinese mainland. In the past 15 years, although foreign  investors have signed investment agreements with a total value  of $200 billion, the foreign-funded enterprises still account  for a very small proportion of China's national economy. The  yearly foreign investment accounts for only 2.2 percent of  China's aggregate investment. On the other hand, the cumulate  investment made by transnational corporations in China accounts  for only 1 percent of their overseas investment. At present,  the more than 50 U.S.-based transnational corporations that have  made investments in China account for only one-tenth of the more  than 500 transnational corporations in the United States. China  still needs funds and technologies in many fields of  development, and still has great potential for attracting  foreign capital. Transnational corporations may have a vast  market in China.    Since last year, in order to strive to join GATT and to  converge with international practice, the Chinese Government has  unified the foreign exchange market, and has partly opened  China's domestic market. The policy for attracting foreign  investment also has been gradually adjusted and perfected in  order to attract transnational corporations to set up their  Asian or Asia-Pacific regional headquarters inside the Chinese  mainland and to encourage foreign investors to invest in  high-tech and capital-intensive projects. Foreign companies now  are allowed to set up investment corporations and joint-stock  companies in China. The scope of opening up to foreign  investment also has been broadened. All this has opened up  various new channels for transnational corporations to invest in  China.</p>

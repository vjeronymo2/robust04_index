			<p>BFN     [Text] Montevideo, 27 May (AFP-NA) -- Government sources  reported that the Argentine and Uruguayan Armies agreed this  week to maintain a "fluid exchange" between the schools in each  country that will train Latin American officers assigned to UN  peacekeeping forces.    Two colonels and two lieutenant colonels, representatives of  the Argentine and Uruguayan Armies, concluded several days of  meetings at Army Headquarters in Montevideo. During the  meetings, they agreed to "cooperate between the two Armies" to  train the future UN officers.    The agreement put an end to a dispute between Argentina's  Carlos Menem and Uruguay's Luis Alberto Lacalle, who were  disputing the seat of an eventual regional school for the Blue  Helmets' military training.    The agreement includes the bilateral exchange of military  trainers who will offer training courses to the Latin American  Armed Forces officers assigned to UN peace missions. The  training courses will take place in both Argentina and Uruguay.    The Uruguayan Armed Forces have a unit of more than 1,100  men  at the service of the United Nations in Mozambique, Western  Sahara, Cambodia, Kashmir, and on the Egyptian-Israeli border,  while Argentina has 1,200 men in UN Blue Helmet units.</p>

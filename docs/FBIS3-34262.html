He accused the political forces participating in the government  of practicing a "strong and backward centralism" in managing the  state's affairs, adding that this shows that there is no desire  to build a united state and its establishments but only a desire  to keep things as they are.    In an interview with AL-AHRAM held at his residence in Aden,  al-'Attas added that he rejected President 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih's offer to join the General People's Congress [GPC]  because he did not want to cause more divisions within the  Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP]. He also confirmed that there are  military movements between the two former sectors of Yemen  following the frustration of the plans made to rebuild,  organize, and unite the Armed Forces since the establishment of  Yemeni unity on 22 May 1993.    Al-'Attas spoke about the presence of terrorists in his  country and how they are used in internal or external  operations. He accused certain Yemeni state organs of  benefiting from these terrorists carrying out operations against  opposing political forces inside the country.    In response to a question about the date of the prime  minister's return to Sanaa, al-'Attas said: "Shortly...when we  reach a full agreement on the security arrangements and the  constitutional and legal guarantees, all of which aim to  reorganize to establish security and stability in all parts of  Yemen and make them the basis for ensuring that the guarantees  agreed on to implement the "Pledge and Agreement" document will  help ensure the implementation of the document." [sentence as  published]    Al-'Attas added: "The responsibility of signing the Pledge  and Agreement document is a big one. There are still big  "differences" in views and these must be resolved by the Yemeni  political forces' Dialogue Committee. We believed that this  issue should not be moved from the Dialogue Committee to a  subcommittee. We believed that these arrangements and  guarantees had to be resolved through the document. But the  others insisted on resolving them through the subcommittee."    The Yemeni prime minister dealt with the many efforts to  reform the system and ensure unity and democracy through the  establishment of law and order. He said: "All these efforts  were met with countermeasures that showed the lack of desire to  build the state and the establishments and the desire to let  matters remain as they were before unity. Some political forces  waged war against national reconstruction and the political,  economic, financial, and administrative reform programs that  were adopted by the government in 1991 and that it started to  implement after being ratified by the Chamber of Deputies. This  is sufficient evidence that there are countermeasures being  taken."    Al-'Attas added that he returned to Aden when the Dialogue  Committee moved to that city after seeing that the work done  between 22 November and the end of December 1993 did not result  in much progress. The committee met from 2 January to 18  January and achieved a great deal that could not be done during  the previous period.    Regarding reports that there are divisions inside the YSP  about continuing the unity process while the opposite is  reportedly unanimous on this issue, the Yemeni prime minister  said: "One of the real mistakes made by the GPC is its constant  effort to create divisions within the YSP and to fragment the  national movement. This is against democracy and it classifies  people. It wishes to see these differences inside the YSP."    Al-'Attas revealed, for the first time, the secret offer  made  to him by Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih to join the GPC  instead of the YSP, adding that this was another indication of  their attempts to create divisions within the YSP.    He said: "Following the incident when the Military Police  stopped me last November while I was on my way to Sanaa, a  telephone call was made between myself and the brother  president. The president asked me to resign from the YSP and  join the GPC to continue in my position as prime minister. This  is evidence of their continued efforts to split the YSP's unity."    Al-'Attas added that his reply to the president's offer was  that relinquishing his YSP membership would not be useful to the  GPC, the YSP, or the Yemeni homeland.    Regarding reports about military movements in preparation  for  a confrontation between the two sides and the allocation of  specific amounts of money to buy equipment and ammunition  without the other side's knowledge, such as the one billion  riyals that the president ordered to be spent in addition to the  state budget or the accusation against the YSP that $300 million  was added to the cost of the oil project in Hadhramaut without  the president's or the government's knowledge for the same  reason, al-'Attas said: "This is the first time I have heard of  such a thing. We may have heard before that the same figure  mentioned was given by Kuwait and Saudi Arabia!"    Al-'Attas added: "First, there is no Yemeni project whose  cost has been increased. All the Yemeni oil projects have been  completed. These projects' budgets have been approved by the  Higher Council for Economic and Oil Affairs. Therefore, what is  being said is really strange. The other side is looking for any  accusation-- regardless of how false--to make against the YSP."    Regarding the military movements, al-'Attas said: "We do not  deny that there are military movements by both sides. We have  repeatedly warned against this, including in our letter to the  Chamber of Deputies in October 1993 when we called for the  control of the Army and security through the allocations, the  expenditures, and the merger. But this has not been done. We  have emphasized our desire that the Armed Forces should not be  used in the conflict. One of the guarantees required to  implement the Pledge and Agreement document is the adoption of  all measures to prevent the use of the Armed Forces as an excuse  to abort the document or to proceed with it in the opposite  direction."    When told that the YSP has been accused of  "internationalizing" the problem, the Yemeni prime minister  said: We in the YSP have not said this, they are saying it. In  his latest trip to Aden as part of the mediation committee,  Chamber of Deputies Speaker Shaykh 'Abdallah al-Ahmar met with  Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid and said that there are two  systems and two states, which is the reality. During the  transitional period, the YSP sought to complete the unification  of all institutions, including the military establishment, but  if you follow these steps you will realize who was obstructing  unification to prevent the establishment of a single state and a  unified army. He added: The others are throwing accusations  right and left at all people and all countries, including Egypt,  but I see it as a Yemeni issue. The problems of application are  Yemeni, too, and they were not born in August 1993, as they  claim, but go as far back as September 1990, immediately after  the Iraqi incursion into Kuwait. The dilemma lies in the  failure to recognize that this is a serious problem facing a  single state and that there is a crisis facing the unified state  because of this dilemma.    Al-'Attas categorically denied the GPC's accusations against  the YSP that the latter has recently received military aid from  Bulgaria with Kuwaiti financing. He said: This is absolutely  untrue. They are accusing many sisterly countries, although  military preparations by all parties to the conflict are clearly  obvious nowadays, but we want to prevent such preparations.    Regarding the secessionist threats facing Yemen's southern  governorates in particular should a separation take place, God  forbid, the Yemeni prime minister said: The threats made by  them are not new. They know very well that the YSP is a  unionist party, that all its practices are unionist, and that it  does not seek a separation. Their remarks always reflect their  inner feelings and what they are thinking. When the dialogue  started, within the tripartite coalition first and at the  national level later on, who was advancing serious and  responsible proposals to emerge from the crisis? Was it the YSP  or the GPC?    Al-'Attas was then asked about the YSP's ambitions for  power,  which exceed the results of the recent parliamentary elections  in Yemen, something that further complicates the crisis. He  said: These accusations are untrue as far as the YSP is  concerned. The proof of this is the debates of the  quadripartite committee that started in November 1991 and  continued until 1993. These discussions prove that the YSP has  never thought of seizing power but has recognized the need for  the participation of all Yemeni political forces.    Al-'Attas said that the YSP consolidated its position  during the recent parliamentary elections. The YSP succeeded in  retaining all the seats in the southern provinces, except for  two that were granted to the GPC [as published]. Meanwhile, the  YSP managed to wrest a number of seats from the GPC in the  north. This represented a great victory for the YSP over the  GPC and the Yemen Reform Party.    The Yemeni prime minister added: The elections were not  disappointing as far as the YSP was concerned because it  demonstrated the YSP's strength. Had it not been for some  terrorist practices by certain sides, the YSP would have  achieved better results, particularly in the northern provinces.    In response to a question about the charges that the YSP is  responsible for the terrorist acts--judging by the historical  record before unity and the attempt to accuse the GPC and other  parties of being responsible for the recent assassinations of  the YSP's cadres--al-'Attas said: When the terrorist acts  started in Yemen, they [not further identified] said that these  practices were the result of a settling of accounts among the  YSP members or were motivated by acts of revenge. The YSP used  to arrest the defendants and refer them to the competent  judicial departments. But the interrogations with the  defendants were always contradictory to the charges against the  YSP. After unity, 151 YSP cadres were liquidated, in addition  to the direct threats against the party.    Al-'Attas continued: The investigations always blamed  external forces, although the perpetrators were Yemenis. In my  capacity as the prime minister, I demanded that assassinations  be halted and measures be taken against a number of defendants  who carried out such assassinations. When the security measures  were implemented, a perpetrator from the southern provinces was  arrested. But the others failed to arrest the defendants at  their end, although the location of the defendants and those  supporting them was known.    Al-'Attas added: When the explosion occurred near my house  in July 1992, a person was arrested whose hands smelled of TNT.  But the next day the security reports were reversed and claimed  that the smell was that of "qat" [narcotic plants].    The Yemeni prime minister then talked about the foreign  dimensions of terrorism which has affected Egypt. He said:  "Terrorism has various forms. Terrorism runs counter to the  democratic course pursued in Yemen. All terrorist practices in  Yemen are listed under the category of terrorism. We have  warned against these practices because the state resorted to  favoritism with some parties to gain their support in  confronting other domestic forces. A number of Yemenis and  non-Yemenis recently returned to Yemen from Afghanistan."    The prime minister added: In my opinion, the presence of  these terrorist elements in Yemen is harmful to the country and  to its relations with other countries. It has become clear that  there is "an overlap" [taqatu'] between the terrorist elements  and the state apparatus. The extent of this "overlap" is not  yet known. As prime minister, during a meeting attended by the  head of the Presidential Council in 1992 I called for the arrest  of the non-Yemeni terrorist elements or their expulsion from the  country. President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih issued a decision on  this matter at that time, but the decision was not implemented.    Some of the Yemeni terrorist elements were detained from the  south governorates. The move was designed to cast a shadow on  these governorates, particularly in view of the "allegations"  that the orders of assassinations were issued by the YSP and  that the said elements were members of the Jihad Party [hizb  al-jihad]. The obvious goal, naturally, was to create further  divisions within the southern governorates.    The Yemeni prime minister accused the GPC of demonstrating  its partitionist designs through the "circular" issued by its  standing committee to Yemeni diplomatic missions abroad. He  said: The GPC standing committee is the authority in charge of  issuing orders to the diplomatic missions abroad.    Answering a question concerning the ineligibility of the  ruling regime in Yemen to lead the unified state because of its  totalitarian history in both states before unity and the fact  that the Yemenis have doubts about that regime and are trying to  find an alternative democratic system, al-'Attas said: I believe  that unity was a great event in Yemen's history. Unity  coincided with democracy and these two developments, if left to  interact with life and reality, will certainly spawn numerous  leaderships. The problem is that the absence of democracy in  the past has not allowed leaderships to emerge, but they will  emerge in the future.    The Yemeni prime minister concluded his interview with  AL-AHRAM by commenting on the task of rebuilding, reorganizing,  and reuniting the Yemeni Armed Forces. He said: The Yemeni  defense minister made several proposals on this matter and some  of these were ratified, but some backsliding took place.    "In March 1992 the Yemeni Cabinet referred the issue to the  prime minister and called for a solution. After meeting with  the leaders of the Defense Ministry, the general principles were  laid down and referred to the presidency. Suddenly, the whole  project was dumped. A third attempt coincided with the formation  of the coalition government. A proposal for rebuilding the  Armed Forces, drafted by the defense minister and his  colleagues, was ratified, with some changes, by the president.  A timetable for its actual implementation was prepared.  Suddenly, a new chief of staff was appointed and that man  requested the postponement of any discussion of this subject.  The result was that nothing was accomplished."    The prime minister spoke about Yemen's link to domestic and  external terrorist incidents. He said: The state has followed  and still follows a policy of "appeasement" of certain political  forces to win their support in the face of other domestic  forces. He added that the presence of terrorists in Yemen is  harmful to that country both on the domestic and foreign levels.  He disclosed the existence of "an overlap" or a yet unclear  exchange of interests between these elements and some Yemeni  state organs. The non-Yemeni elements have not been expelled  from the country, he said.</p>

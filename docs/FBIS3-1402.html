He was the keynote speaker at a  Western Cape regional reconstruction and development conference.  "We know we are going to stamp freedom on Natal," he said.    "Yesterday the biggest march in the country's history stated  clearly that the people of Natal are going to the polls, come  rain, come shine and whether (Chief) Buthelezi likes it or not."    The march had brought a great deal of hope. "We are going to  install a unique peace in Natal where our people can campaign  securely. If (Chief) Buthelezi does not like it, we will impose  it on him. We are the ANC -- We will call the shots in Natal as  we call the shots in the whole country," Mr Ramaphosa said.    He said the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] was  saying  it was impossible to hold free and fair elections in Natal even  before the election was held. "If the attitude of the kwaZulu  government continues then it is not possible to hold free and  fair elections there and the IEC will not be able to make such a  declaration at the end."    This had propelled the ANC to put pressure on State  President  F W de Klerk to take steps. "We had talks with him but he  ducked and dived out of taking action." The ANC would  nevertheless impose peace there.    Mr Ramaphosa said the fact that the NP [National Party] had  fielded totally discredited ministers to become `provincial  premiers'showed it was not serious about transforming the  country.    It had nominated Law and Order Minister Hernus Kriel for the  Western Cape, "while his whole department is deeply immersed in  the murder of our people".    In the Eastern Cape it had nominated Dr. Tertius Delport  whose long relationship with the right wing had almost led him  to defect from the NP. In Natal it was Mr George Bartlett.  "The NP has no commitment to non-racism or reconstruction in  this country." The ANC would expose the tactics and racist  slogans it was using. The ANC was daily gaining support for its  Reconstruction and Development Program -- the most comprehensive  document on socio- economic issues ever developed in the history  of the country. "One of the central reasons for people being  attracted is because they can see we have a plan to address the  ills and evils that have been visited on our people by  apartheid. The entire leadership is behind this programme and  declaring it will be implemented whether FW (de Klerk) and the  NP like it or not."</p>

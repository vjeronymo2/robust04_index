			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THEY'RE IN THE FUNNY MONEY  </P> <P> For at least a moment, it must have seemed like Christmas came late to a  northeast Los Angeles neighborhood Tuesday.  </P> <P> Police responded to a 7:30 a.m. call about $20 bills "flying all over" Los  Feliz Boulevard near Lowry Road, Officer Gene Hancock said. By the time  officers arrived at the scene -- within six minutes -- the money was virtually  gone.  </P> <P> One problem, said Hancock. Turns out the bills were fake.  </P> <P> "It was a good photographic copy of the money, but it was obviously the wrong  kind of paper," he said.  </P> <P> The police weren't the only ones who realized the money was funny. "People kept  calling and saying, 'It's fake' and hanging up," Officer Cook Barela said.  </P> <P> One woman brought in 41 of the $20 bills Wednesday morning, Hancock said. For  others holding onto the fake cash, Hancock politely warns that possession of  counterfeit currency is against the law.  </P> <P> Police remain uncertain how much may have been scattered. And how the bills  came to rest on Los Feliz Boulevard is still unexplained.  </P> <P> It's not unusual for people to throw money around at Christmas, the officers  noted. But Barela offered a few suggestions.  </P> <P> "I think it was 'Totally Hidden Video,' " he said, referring to a current  television show similar to "Candid Camera." "Either that, or a present from  Noriega." LORI GRANGE  </P></p>

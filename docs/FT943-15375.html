			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Kingfisher busy Stores group Kingfisher jumped 12 to 528p as the company's joint broker, the notoriously secretive Cazenove, turned more positive on the stock. Cazenove never comments on its moves but sources close to Kingfisher said the brokerage house had taken the view that the derating of the company by the City had been overdone. Cazenove is thought to have reasoned that the owner of chains Woolworths, B&amp;Q, Comet and Superdrug was taking a more pragmatic attitude to pricing. The move follows a more positive view taken by BZW last week. Body Shop fell 2 1/2 to 243p after announcing that Mrs Anita Roddick and Mr Gordon Roddick had sold 3.5m shares at 240p each reducing their stake to 25.4 per cent. The sale raised Pounds 8.4m which is targeted at charity and company projects. Leading pharmaceuticals stocks were supported by some institutional buying but are likely to open weaker on Monday as a result of the late plunge in the dollar. Glaxo ended 10 better at 571p, Wellcome, which filed for approval of a new anti-herpes treatment, added 5 at 606p and Zeneca gained 2 to 737p. International news and electronic information group Reuters Holdings is also likely to suffer but its shares received a boost from a Kleinwort Benson buy recommendation ahead of interim figures at the end of the month. Reuters gained 3 to 464p Printing and packing group Bowater slumped 13 to 430 after the group announced that it had lost its executive director, Mr Stuart Wallis to Fisons, which gained 2 on the news but closed unchanged at 138. British Gas attracted keen interest with the shares moving up to 277p before slipping back late in the session and closing a penny off at 271p after heavy turnover of 8.1m. Dealers said the initial strength followed reports that the government had decided to drop legislation from the Queen's speech planned for the autumn, which would introduce competition in the domestic gas market in the UK. Nomura was one broking house seeing the reports as possible good news for British Gas. 'At a minimum it gives Gas's management more time to prepare for a competitive market and with a general election looming in 1996-7 it may be that competition will be postponed until the next century,' said Mr Steve Turner of Nomura. Television and leisure company Granada Group added 5 to 507p, after a modest profits upgrade from Hoare Govett, its broker which is believed to have increased its current year profits forecast by Pounds 6m to Pounds 250m. The prospect of Thorn EMI demerging several of its businesses, together with the hopes of a bullish trading statement at the group's annual meeting next week, boosted the shares another 13 to 1039p. Switching in the banks sector was not confined to RBOS and NatWest. There was heavy trading in TSB where a block of 3m shares was sold into the market at 195p. The stock overhang in General Accident, which depressed it from mid-week onwards, was said to have been partly cleared yesterday with the remainder expected to be disposed of early on Monday. It closed 8 lower at 558p. Turnover in Berkeley Group, the housebuilder hit 5.1m shares, with a block of 2.4m traded at 390p and another of 2.2m at 393p. Cable &amp; Wireless jumped 6 to 405p on good turnover of 4.6m, helped by buy recommendations from Kleinwort Benson and NatWest Securities. Engineering company TI hardend 4 to 358p, after James Capel reiterated its buy recommendation. It drew attention to the impressive underlying growth at the company. Reports that Smiths Industries had lost a lucrative contract with Boeing left the shares trailing 6 to 435p. Eurodollar, a vehicle distribution company issued at 220p, ended its first day of trading at a 2p premium at 222p.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] This evening, Radio Liberty informed about a news  conference by Igor Kasatonov, deputy commander of the Russian  Navy, which was held in St. Petersburg. [Word indistinct]  according to Igor Kasatonov, Russian units located in the Crimea  were ordered to stand on alert. The admiral's reason for this  was Ukraine's alleged intent to capture naval bases in [name  indistinct], Mykolayev, and Ochakov.    The Defense Ministry press service commented on this  statement by the Russian military leader calling it  disinformation intended to create hysteria around the Black Sea  Fleet. The press service considers Kasatonov's statement about  Ukraine's plans to capture the mentioned bases as absolutely  unfounded. At the same time, the press service stresses that  there are no Russian military units on Ukrainian territory; the  only units there are those subordinated to the presidents of  Russia and Ukraine.</p>

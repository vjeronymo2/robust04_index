			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NORIEGA BODYGUARD OVERHEARD INVASION DISCUSSED, U.S. SAYS  </P> <P> A bodyguard to Manuel Antonio Noriega overheard two U.S. servicemen discussing  the invasion of Panama hours before it occurred, a Pentagon spokesman said  today.  </P> <P> It was unclear, however, whether the guard relayed that information to Noriega  or whether the incident played any role in the U.S. failure to capture Noriega  in the days after the invasion.  </P> <P> "There is some evidence that some officials may have had some advance thought  that this operation was about to happen. But there isn't a lot of evidence that  actions were taken as a result of that," Defense Department spokesman Pete  Williams told reporters.  </P> <P> "A bodyguard during a debriefing interview said that two U.S. soldiers had been  overheard discussing their positions for H-hour. And that supposedly happened  at 10 p.m., three hours before the attack was to begin," Williams said.  </P></p>

G."-initialled report: "Complaints About a Lack of </F> Understanding"]    [Text] Bonn, 1 March -- On Tuesday [1 March], Azerbaijan's  Foreign Minister Hassanov had a meeting in Bonn with Development  Minister Spranger and officials from the Foreign Ministry,  during which his country's conflict with Armenia over the  enclave of Nagorny-Karabakh was discussed. Hassanov complained  about a lack of understanding on Germany's part and said that  Germany was favorably disposed toward Armenia's position. The  Azerbaijani Foreign Minister was unable to meet his host,  Foreign Minister Kinkel. Kinkel had remained in Brussels,  because of the negotiations with Austria and Finland on  admission to the European Union. He wrote Hassanov a letter in  which he said that the Federal Government was ready to cooperate  with Azerbaijan and work out a joint statement that would serve  as the basis for the development of relations. Kinkel asked  Hassanov to wait for him in Bonn, but the Azerbaijani foreign  minister left and observed in annoyance that he had enough to do  in Baku and had to meet the Swedish chairman of the CSCE working  group responsible for Nagorny-Karabakh, Elaisson, on Wednesday.  Spranger wants to send one of his ministry officials to  Azerbaijan to examine project opportunities. This is to be  followed by the drawing up of a program for cooperation.    Hassanov spoke to Bundestag Deputy Wimmer, the chairman of  the parliamentary group dealing with the Caucasus. Wimmer wants  to bring about a meeting between Azerbaijani and Armenian  deputies in Germany. Hassanov said that Azerbaijani deputies  were ready to take part in such a meeting. The Armenians have  yet to agree. The Azerbaijanis have as little against Wimmer's  mediation attempt, which is to bring about negotiations between  the deputies on finding a solution to the dispute over  Nagorny-Karabakh, as they do against the intentions of Russia  and Turkey to become involved in finding ways to reach  agreement. The initiative came from Wimmer, but Azerbaijan  would also like "Germany to be actively involved in finding a  solution to the problem."    Azerbaijan has only one condition for an end to the  fighting:  "Armenian troops must withdraw from the occupied territories."    Azerbaijan is prepared to negotiate over a "guarantee  status"  for the Armenians living in Nagorny-Karabakh. Hassanov  described such guarantees as "special rights." International  observers, above all the CSCE, could be involved in determining  the content of the guarantees. The Armenians living in the  enclave could have the same "full rights" as the Azerbaijanis.  This would not affect the question of belonging to the  Azerbaijani state. Speaking in Bonn, Hassanov charged that  Armenia wants to carve up sovereign Turkish territory with the  help of the Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK], the Kurdish  underground organization. By contrast, Azerbaijan maintained  "clear interstate relations" with Turkey, relations that were  constantly becoming closer. Azerbaijan's embassy in the Federal  Republic is housed in the Turkish Embassy building.    Hassanov was not keen to talk about developments in Russia  and their possible consequences for Moscow's relations with  other states that formerly belonged to the Soviet Union.  Hassanov reacted with apparent incomprehension to questions  about Russian imperial aspirations, such as have been noted in  the Baltic republics. Hassanov said that in contrast to the  Baltic republics, there were no Russian troops stationed in  Azerbaijan. There were neither official or unofficial  statements emanating from Moscow that allow one to conclude that  Russia wished to establish military bases in Azerbaijan. The  release of the putschists Khasbulatov and Rutskoy was an  internal Russian matter and the result of a decision made by the  Russian parliament. After Azerbaijan achieved independence in  1989, relations with Russia at first cooled. Now, however,  after President Aliyev came to power, efforts were being made  "continually to improve relations." The process is underway.  Aliyev was a member of the Moscow Politburo during Soviet times.</p>

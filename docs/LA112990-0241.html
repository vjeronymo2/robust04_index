			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CHECK YULETIDE WRAPPING PAPER! IT MAY BE $1 BILLS  </P> <P> Warning! Check carefully before throwing out that wrapping paper. The dollar  bills on it could be real.  </P> <P> Maus &amp; Hoffman clothing stores in southern Florida have been wrapping  holiday gifts in uncut sheets of 32 genuine $1 bills for eight years.  </P> <P> And co-owner William Maus Jr. has grown accustomed to a familiar lament.  </P> <P> He said many a gift recipient complains: "O my God, I didn't know it was real!"  And that's usually after Christmas, he added, which means it's been ripped open  or thrown away."  </P> <P> Some people ignore or simply don't believe the store's "WARNING" sticker  attached to each package wrapped with the dollar bills.  </P> <P> The store sells the sheets for $55 -- $23 over face value -- and only to  customers who make a purchase.  </P> <P> But the sheets are familiar holiday fare at stores throughout the nation, said  Leah Akbar, a spokeswoman for the Bureau of Engraving and Printing in  Washington.  </P> <P> Bureau visitors can buy the sheets in presses of 32, 16 and four $1 bills.  They're also available by mail and sell for $47, $28 and $10.25, respectively.  </P> <P> Akbar said the price includes handling and shipping and that any profit goes  toward paying workers at the bureau gift center in Washington. Delivery takes  eight to 10 weeks.  </P> <P> The address for mail-order bills is Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Public  Sales, Room 602-11A, Washington, D.C. 20228.  </P></p>

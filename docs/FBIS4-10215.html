During this required technical stopover, Robaina  will spend most of his time holding news conferences with Buenos  Aires' most important newspapers and television and radio news  networks. Exclusive interviews with Channel 13, the newspaper EL  CLARIN, PAGINA DOCE, Radio America Dos, and the news agencies  ANSA and EFE have already been confirmed.    Today, Roberto Robaina will meet with Argentine Foreign  Minister Guido di Tella, who for work reasons will not be in  Buenos Aires during the Cuban delegation's official visit. In  the same way, several entrepreneurs in the pharmaceutical sphere  have expressed great interest in speaking to Minister Robaina on  Friday [8 April] to learn of Cuba's achievements in the area of  biopharmaceuticals.    With this 48-hour technical stopover in Buenos Aires en  route  to Peru, the subject of Cuba; its current reality; and its  economic, political, and social prospects are beginning to be  heard in Argentine public opinion before the delegation's  official visit.</p>

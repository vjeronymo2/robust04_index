			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BUILDER PULLS OUT OVER PAY AT AIRPORT  </P> <P> The subcontracting firm that is building the new upper-level roadway for John  Wayne Airport's new passenger terminal pulled its 60-person work force off the  job Thursday in a pay dispute with the general contractor, airport officials  said.  </P> <P> The subcontractor, Kettering-Kruseman of Artesia, told employees not to come to  work today and said the firm would "wait and see" about renewing work next  week, according to an employee who declined to identify himself to a reporter.  </P> <P> Company and airport officials confirmed the employee's account but said they  could provide no details. Earlier this year, another subcontractor briefly  walked off the job until the general contractor, Taylor Woodrow California  Construction Ltd., paid subcontractors out of corporate funds instead of  waiting for money from the county, which owns the airport.  </P> <P> Payments have been 30 to 90 days behind schedule at times due to disputes over  change orders and documentation requested by the county to support contractor  and subcontractors' billings.  </P> <P> Taylor Woodrow officials were unavailable for comment.  </P> <P> Kettering &amp; Kruseman attorney James McGee of Irvine said the dispute is  over Taylor Woodrow's failure to pay $1.3 million to the subcontractor's. "They  missed the payroll payment on May 15. They missed the payroll payment on May  30." Under their contract, Taylor Woodrow agreed that Kettering &amp; Kruseman  could withdraw workers if payments are more than five days late, McGee said,  adding:  </P> <P> "Kettering &amp; Kruseman is concerned that Taylor Woodrow does not have  sufficient money to make the payment. So this is a major problem."  </P> <P> McGee noted that there has been "a lot of speculation that Taylor Woodrow bid  the project too low and therefore at some point toward the end of the job,  there just would not be sufficient money coming from the county to pay the  subcontractors."  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Susumu Saito, president of Trilateral Economic </F> Institute: "Too Early To Say Economy Has Hit Bottom; This Fiscal  Year the Economy Will Continue in a Down Trend"]    [Text] As was the case in the spring of last year,  optimistic forecasts and assessments are being widely circulated  that the Japanese economy has finally hit bottom and is in the  process of rebounding after a long recession; even monetary  authorities are saying that the economy is nearing the bottom,  despite a persistent slowing of the growth in money supply.  However, we must review the situation with a strict distinction  between the desire for the economy to improve and whether  objective conditions exist that substantiate a rebound in the  economy.  <H5>  Voodoo Economics </H5>   If we were to merely piece together fragments of favorable  data, we would not be able to remove ourselves from the purview  of voodoo economics. Whether the data are favorable or  unfavorable, we must begin with a process of gaining an accurate  picture of the current situation in order to begin a debate  about the proper economic countermeasures.    Such an approach requires that we engage in analysis and  debate covering the basics of macroeconomics and analysis of  personal income. Fundamental macroeconomics teaches the basic  relationship that, if the combined investments of the private  sector and public works grow, production and incomes will grow  after a time lag, and that an expansion in incomes will result  in the growth of private-sector consumption.    About one year after the start of the sharp drop in stock  prices at the beginning of 1990, despite the increase in public  works investments, the sharp decline in private-sector  investments led to a start in sluggishness in overall  investments and one year thereafter the gross domestic product  (GDP) became sluggish. Both private-sector consumption and GDP  became sluggish at the same time.    Even the economic decline of the latter half of fiscal year  1993, which was unexpected by government authorities and the  majority of economic commentators, should not have been any  surprise as long as they were dispassionately observing the  significance of the sharp drop in capital investments and sharp  decline in overall investments owing to untimely economic  measures which took place in the second half of 1992.    It was readily obvious that arguments that fiscal expansion  had no effect on the economy were in error. Economic measures  were definitely not taken in a timely manner. However, if the  public works investment increases ordered under economic  measures had not taken place, overall investment declines would  have been much sharper and the economic situation would have  been much worse.    Those who argue that fiscal expansion had no effect on the  economy assert that fiscal expansion caused domestic interest  rates to rise, led to a stronger yen, caused a decline in demand  for imports, and negated benefits of demand expansion effects of  fiscal policy.    However, those were the results of inadequate monetary  relaxation measures taken in response to fiscal expansion and  were not of a nature that could be directly tied to the  ineffectiveness of fiscal policy.  <H5>  Attention Focused on Overall Investment Trends </H5>   The question now is, what can we project in the way of  trends  for GDP if we focus on overall investments?    A survey of capital investment plans for a variety of  categories indicates that the growth in capital investments will  fall to an annual negative growth rate of 5 percent to 10  percent. Residential investments represent about 33 percent of  the overall capital investments, while recent rises in  residential loan interest rates are expected to bring housing  growth to a standstill, and, when combined with overall capital  investments, will have no major effect on private-sector  investment trends.    Public works investments are expected to grow at an annual  rate of 10-20 percent. They grew about 15 percent over the prior  year period between the second and fourth quarters of 1993.    If the growth rates for private-sector investments and  public  works investments are simulated on the basis of the foregoing  expectations, we can arrive at the growth rate for overall  investments.    The economic outlook based on the most optimistic overall  investment forecasts indicates that GDP growth will be moderate.  <H5>  Strong Yen May Call for Downward Revision </H5>   At issue here is that the survey of capital investments  published thus far does not reflect the potential for downward  revision of capital investment plans based on the strong yen  beginning in the middle of February 1994. Actual capital  investments are running at a rate 10 percent below the projected  low range. They will probably run along the same trendline in  fiscal year 1994 as a result of downward revisions.    Additionally, if public works investment growth is estimated  at 15 percent on an interim basis and we arrive at an average  overall investment scenario, fiscal year 1994 will witness a  further decline and the possibility of further worsening in the  economy. Further, when one considers the delay in the approval  of the fiscal year 1994 budget and that public works investment  growth in fiscal year 1993 fell below 15 percent, there is the  major possibility that overall investments will fall below the  average scenario levels.</p>

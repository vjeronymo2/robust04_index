			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Wellcome takes 5% stake in US group WELLCOME, the UK-based drugs company, has agreed to take a 5 per cent stake in Centocor, once a high-flying US biotechnology company that was brought low last year when it failed to secure Food and Drug Administration approval for its main product. Wellcome will help develop and market some of the company's anti-cancer drugs, principally Panorex, Centocor said on Friday. This drug is in final trials in Germany and its first sales there could come in 1995, said Mr David Holveck, chief executive. Wellcome will buy 2m new shares in the company, whose stock closed on Friday before the announcement at Dollars 9 1/4 . The price was not revealed but Mr Holveck said it was paying a premium. It will also pay royalties to the company, though these have yet to be agreed. In a similar deal last year, Eli Lilly is believed to have paid Dollars 50m for a 5 per cent stake in Centocor as part of a plan to develop and market Centoxin, a treatment for bacterial infection. The FDA's failure to approve Centoxin for the US market led to a collapse in the share price of Centocor, which had previously been among the top five US biotech companies by market capitalisation.</p>

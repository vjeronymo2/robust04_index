			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Survey of the Restructuring of Eastern Germany (17): The barbed wire remains - Judy Dempsey tours Gorlitz, a divided city on the Polish frontier The rusty barbed wire separating Poland from Germany had not yet been taken down. The road and border crossing signs needed a coat of paint. But the Polish border guards were no longer surly. They casually inspected my passport. Perhaps they were more interested in the traders close to the bridge which connects the German and Polish sectors of Gorlitz (the Polish part is called Zgorzelec). Energetic young Polish men were trying to sell cartons of cigarettes to visitors. As the thick cold fog gave way to heavy rain, I crossed the bridge over the river Neisse from Poland to the German side of Gorlitz, an old merchant city once granted trading privileges from the King of Bohemia. Located in the south-eastern corner of eastern Germany, the city had been divided after the second world war, when the and Neisse (which flows through Gorlitz) became part of Poland's new western border. With the collapse of the Iron Curtain, the German half of the city is trying to find its place in the new united Germany. At the same time, the gap between Gorlitz and Zgorzlec is widening, particularly in infrastructure, thanks to assistance from Bonn and the state of Saxony. 'We want to put Gorlitz on the map and attract investors here,' said Mr Jorg-Peter Thoms, an official responsible for construction and economic issues at the city's local council. Before German unification many of Gorlitz's 69,000 people were dependent on Deutsche Waggonbau, the large rail carriage manufacturer which employed 3,800 but today has fewer than 1,650 on its books, the textile industry, and the electricity complex at Hagenwerder, which will be closed down by 1997. 'There are investment opportunities and the state of Saxony offers financial incentives for anyone setting up business here,' said Mr Thoms. The city had DM14m-15m in grants for the centre itself, but investment had been sluggish. 'We have to improve the routes into Gorlitz,' he explained, adding that once the A4 motorway was complete, and the train services improved, this extraordinarily beautiful city, one of the few in eastern Germany whose centre has not been spoiled by crass communist pre-fabricated architecture, would prosper. He is also waiting for an end to the recession in western Germany. Recession apart, investment in Gorlitz is also linked to resolving the outstanding property questions. Although investors have priority over restitution, compensation claims by former owners continue to act as a brake on investment. Ms Annette Kreisch, 25, is the acting head of the Property Rights office in Gorlitz. The office has had no department head since last October, when the last one, a west German lawyer, left, the third to do so since late 1990. Since that time, the inadequate staff of 22 people - all east Germans - and all confronted with complex legislation on property rights - have had to deal with more than 6,400 claims. By early 1994, the office had resolved 2,300 of them. It is estimated that the remaining 4,100 cases will require at least another four years. 'We are faster than some other offices in eastern Germany,' said Ms Kreisch. But some claimants, including Mr Frederick Kaufmann, who had to leave Gorlitz in 1938, have been trying nearly four years to get their property back. The local Chamber of Commerce, or IHK, says the property rights issue is not holding up investment. 'Investment, in the form of services, and even manufacturing - Siemens, for instance, has bought the Turbinenwerk here - will pick up once the infrastructure improves and the recession ends,' said Mr Bernd Flamminger. The IHK'S members have invested DM153m since 1992. 'You see, we want investors to use Gorlitz as a stepping off point for Poland, as well as to countries in the former Soviet Union. It makes sense. By using our city as a base, companies can do business with eastern Europe.' Officials at the IHK are all too aware that Gorlitz has to compete with Leipzig, one of the fastest growing cities in eastern Germany, and Dresden, the state capital of Saxony. 'Look, it's the unemployment that gets people down,' said Mr Klaus Ulrich Eisenhammer. Mr Eisenhammer works at the local employment office, a modern bright building which was home to the Pentacon camera factory. But it was forced into liquidation and closed after unification with the loss of 1,500 jobs. 'I don't want to sound pessimistic, but there's not much left of the old Gorlitz in terms of local industry. The textile enterprises, which once employed 2,000 have closed. Women have borne the brunt. Two out of every three people unemployed are women,' he said. The employment office, which also serves nearby Bautzen, last year spent more than DM3bn supporting the unemployed and those on government-supported job creation and retraining schemes and those who had taken early retirement. 'There were 6,196 unemployed. If we add the other class of unemployed, those on the government schemes and short-time work, we have an additional 7,000 people. That's a lot of people,' said Mr Eisenhammer, who admitted that the really secure jobs were at the employment office. He was hopeful about one thing - 'we have to rely on the small craftsmen and traders to soak up some of the unemployed. That's a real plus, especially as more and more people, and former owners renovate their houses and investors modernise offices. But you know because of border zone regulations, contractors here can legally hire Polish workers from just across the border and pay them far less.' Across town, Mr Roman Muller, managing director of Deutsche Wagonbau, or DWA, knows how much the people of Gorlitz depends on the 145-year-old railway carriage manufacturer. Unlike other Treuhand enterprises, DWA makes money. Consolidated profits for the group weres DM23.3m in 1992 on a turnover of DM3.6bn, with the Gorlitz branch accounting for DM16m. Despite selling only to the east German and Russian market before unification, DWA Gorlitz has managed to earn half its last year's turnover of DM420m from the German market. Retaining the current levels of employment, just under 1,700, will depend on how the Treuhand privatises DWA - as a whole or in parts  - as well as orders from Russia. The shortage of hard currency in Russia has meant that the management in Gorlitz has placed more than 400 of its employees on short-time work. Gorlitz needs someone like Mr Matthias Lechner, its energetic mayor, to instil hope and a sense of perspective. But the 42-year-old aspiring politician, is no idealist. Before unification he belonged to no party and now belongs to Chancellor Helmut Kohl's governing Christian Democrats. He has few illusions about the time it will take to restructure industry, as well as build a new political infrastructure. Since May 1990, he had spent at least 12 hours a day trying to rebuild confidence among a community suffering from 35 per cent unemployment, if one takes into account all the people on retraining and job-creation schemes. What surprises him was 'how quickly people forget the past. It's only four years since unification, yet people sometimes think the old days were better. It's a strange phenomenon.' One of the greatest difficulties facing Mr Lechner is persuading people to become politically engaged - 'you need a lot of time for politics now. I don't think people want to spend that much time, particularly since politics means accountability. When the council, for example, wants to raise the price on the public transport in order to pay for infrastructure costs, we were faced with a lot of complaints and naturally we have to explain all our decisions. Money is precious. We have to be careful how we spend it.' According to Mr Lechner, the debts of Gorlitz amount to DM1,240 per capita of the local population, a level typical of other eastern German towns and cities. 'We have a credit line of DM100m from the banks and a separate budget of DM250m. But our tax revenue income is only about DM30m. Reaping results from local government politics is a slow process. 'You have to remember that people were so politicised in the old sense, that after unification they simply withdrew and tried to cope with unification and the traumas thrown up by it.' Mr Lechner, who is standing again as mayor in next June's local government elections, believes he can muster enough support to win, although he - and his deputy, Ms Renate Schwarze who represents the opposition Social Democratic Party - have few party activists upon whom to rely. The CDU in Gorlitz has 250 paid up members; the SPD, 80.</p>

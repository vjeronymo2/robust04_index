			<p><P> August 29, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNTDOWN FOR SHUTTLE BLASTOFF GETS GREEN LIGHT  </P> <P> NASA managers Tuesday cleared the repaired space shuttle Columbia for the  overnight start of its countdown for a Saturday blastoff, setting the stage for  the first shuttle flight in four months.  </P> <P> The countdown was scheduled to begin early today for a pre-dawn liftoff on  Saturday.  </P> <P> Columbia's seven-member crew was scheduled to fly to Florida from Houston  tonight for final preparations.  </P> <P> Space agency managers discussed the possibility of delaying the flight at least  a day in order to first move the shuttle Discovery to a nearby launching pad  for work to ready it for an Oct. 5 flight to carry the Ulysses solar probe into  space.  </P> <P> But, late Tuesday, engineers reported that Discovery would not be ready for the  move until Saturday night at the earliest, and officials decided to press ahead  with plans to launch Columbia on time.  </P> <P> Columbia originally was scheduled to be launched on May 30, but the flight was  delayed because of a hydrogen fuel leak in the ship's 17-inch-wide "disconnect"  fitting, which allows the external tank to be jettisoned in space.  </P></p>

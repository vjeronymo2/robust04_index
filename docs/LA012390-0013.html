			<p><P> January 23, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A CAUTIONARY TALE OF RAISED EXPECTATIONS;  </P> <P> DEMOCRACY: A LESSON LEARNED IN THE PHILIPPINES IS INSTRUCTIVE FOR EASTERN  EUROPE: THERE'S NO QUICK FIX, THE ROAD IS ROCKY AND THE REVIEWS ARE NASTY.  </P> <P> Corazon Aquino of the Philippines and Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia have a lot  in common.  </P> <P> Both are "citizen presidents" catapulted reluctantly to power by the masses.  Untainted and untrained, they are referred to as "just a housewife" and "just a  playwright." For each of their countries, Aquino and Havel have symbolic  importance beyond the significant roles thrust upon them. They embody their  peoples' hope for a new order that is "clean," inclusive and prosperous. To  realize that hope, they face impossible challenges that would daunt more  seasoned politicians. Yet produce they must.  </P> <P> Four years hence, will Havel too be called "weak" and "indecisive" if  Czechoslovakia is not yet a thriving democracy? Those are the adjectives used  to define Aquino's seeming inability to turn around 20 years of damage in the  four years that she has been in charge. In a speech to an American audience,  she addressed these criticisms directly: "I think they wanted a calvary officer  and not a President because people kept urging me to be more impetuous. I was  surprised at the premium men, especially, put on recklessness."  </P> <P> In this simple statement, Aquino capsulized the dilemma that not only she  encounters daily, but also Havel and the new leaders of Eastern European  democracies. How does one lead a people accustomed to strongman techniques and  get them to respond positively to the different leadership styles and  strategies that nurturing democracies need to succeed?  </P> <P> The rapid tumble of dictatorships and one-party rule this past holiday season  generated a euphoria that obscures the rough times ahead. For these fledgling  democracies, the Philippines stands as a cautionary tale.  </P> <P> The founding mother of "people power," Aquino also rode an international crest  of good will that created unreal expectations from the start. Seeing how  swiftly the Marcos regime had fallen, most Filipinos anticipated a rapid change  in the quality of their lives. Although Eastern Europeans seem to have a  clearer understanding of the financial crisis they are facing, there is  nonetheless a palpable expectation that things will be different -- right away.  </P> <P> What they may not realize and what Filipinos did not anticipate is the rough  and painful road to national reconstruction. Ferdinand Marcos' legacy was a  nation on the brink of financial ruin, epitomized by a $29-billion foreign  debt. Worse, economic deterioration was accompanied by the subversion and  corruption of the country's institutions. "Getting around the system" had  become a way of life for most Filipinos.  </P> <P> For Eastern Europeans, the economic and social legacy of their ousted leaders  is similar to the one left by Marcos. Furthermore, Eastern Europeans share with  their Asian counterparts a potential clash between their desire for change and  the habits of old.  </P> <P> This is the past that must be acknowledged in any assessment of Aquino, Havel  and other Eastern European leaders. Initial changes will take place in each of  their countries. Aquino, for instance, has restored all democratic processes  and institutions, passed a new constitution, held elections, resumed payments  on Philippine foreign debt and encouraged enough foreign investment so that her  country has been able to post a modest 5% to 6% economic growth rate. Not bad  for a leader often perceived as a cup half full, either by virtue of her gender  or lack of government experience.  </P> <P> But these accomplishments may not mean much to Filipinos who saw democracy as  more loose change in their pockets. Bewildered by the cacophony of unbridled  democracy, denied the economic quick fix they desired and not recognizing the  burdens imposed by their nation's past, some Filipinos are now hankering for  the simplicity of imposed order embodied in the tantalizing idea of a military  junta. External discipline is easier than the internal discipline needed to  make democracy work.  </P> <P> The Philippine story is not yet complete and no one should underestimate the  staying power of Aquino or the commitment of Filipinos to democracy. However,  the cycle it has undergone to date is likely to be the same pattern (with  varying gradations) that may be followed by the newly forming democracies of  Eastern Europe. These nations will be led by men and women unschooled in the  basic business of running a government. They learn as they rule, and the  swiftness of events as well as the national impatience that accompanies major  upheavals will not allow them the luxury of time they need to develop. Some may  escape the vilification of their constituents, but more than likely they will  be buffeted by the different factions that emerge with every incipient  democracy.  </P> <P> The rigors imposed by measures needed to bring about economic recovery will tax  the commitment of each citizen to democratic processes. Long-range goals don't  fulfill short-range hunger. In some instances, a yearning for the old order may  crystallize into a military resurgence or a revitalized Communist Party.  </P> <P> A grim scenario -- or is it the necessary voyage of evolving democracies? Will  Vaclav Havel and Corazon Aquino successfully steer their countries away from  this historic U-turn? Let's hope so. In the meantime, judgment should be  withheld by all democracy-watchers eager to play Monday-morning quarterback  after any setback. For there will be many such reversals. After all, it is  easier to win democracy than to run it.  </P></p>

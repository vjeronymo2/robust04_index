			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by New York correspondent Osamu Kobayashi: "Fear of </F> Hollowing Out Fetters"]    [Text] Whether in electronics or the automotive field, a  common headache experienced in varying degrees by Japanese  companies in the United States is the "tug of war" being played  out with Japan over employment concerns at parent companies. "We  feel threatened," complains a top executive for a Japanese  electronics manufacturing affiliate in the United States,  referring to a troubling question often put to them; namely,  "what's going to happen to domestic industries if they are  `hollowed out' [by the transfer of manufacturing capacity to  overseas plants]?"    As of the end of 1991, direct investments in the United  States by the Japanese manufacturing industry amounted to a  book-value balance of $69.5 billion (or about 7 trillion yen at  the yen's present exchange rate). But from the profit end, when  revenues and expenditures are averaged out, that adds up to a  deficit. One of the main reasons is that companies invested in  personnel and equipment ahead of time on speculation of the  yen's future increase in value and the extent of trade problems.    The importance of local production can't be measured in  terms  of cost alone. Common to the Honda Accord, Toyota's Camry and  other Japanese cars that have been hits in the United States is  the fact that, with their production localized from the  development stage, they were made according to American tastes  in automobiles. Just the fact alone that clear differences  emerged in the tastes of U.S. and Japanese car buyers during  the development process indicates the important results that  localization can achieve.    In the home electronics industry, which has also pushed  ahead  with local production in the United States, a certain air of  determination has become evident. American Matsushita  Electronics (AMEC), which produces television cathode-ray tubes,  has decided to source only 8 percent of its materials from Japan  by 1995 (down from 20 percent in 1993). AMEC President Kazuya  Ashizaki is quite clear in stating their plans. "Production in  Japan will be limited to specialized, high value-added tubes,  while more general-use tubes will be produced in the United  States and Asia, where there's a consumer market for them."    There may be some resistance to shifting production overseas  given the strong fear in Japan about losing domestic employment  opportunities, but the key to global competitiveness may very  well lie in reducing costs and expanding local production.</p>

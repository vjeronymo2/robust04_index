			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Finns make more spending cuts Finland's government yesterday proposed a further FM9.3bn (Dollars 1.5bn) in cuts to keep state spending within target, following a dramatic increase in unemployment pay-outs, writes Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm. The main burden will fall on the public sector, where state and municipality wage costs are to be cut by FM3.8bn.</p>

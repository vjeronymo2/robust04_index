			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Sales of new cars rise for fourth month in succession UK NEW car sales rose by 7 per cent in January, the fourth consecutive month in which registrations have been higher than in the corresponding period a year ago. Mr Ian McAllister, chairman of Ford of Britain, said the figures indicated that 'a sustained recovery' in the market could well be under way. The growth in sales last month was because of a higher level of purchases by private customers rather than by company fleets, he said. The increase in retail sales was 'particularly encouraging' and indicated that abolition of special car tax last year and the reduction in interest rates was having a positive effect on consumer confidence, said Mr McAllister. Professor Garel Rhys, Professor of Motor Industry Economics at Cardiff Business School, cautioned against optimism based on the January sales figures. 'Last month's car figures were in fact dreadful,' he said. 'The previous January was very poor, being 11.7 per cent down on the 1990 figure. But since then the 10 per cent special car tax has been abolished. That should should have lifted last month's market by 12 per cent on its own. 'The extent to which the market is up shows the recession is still there and that people remain very cautious about buying,' he added. New car registrations in January totalled 164,939, a 7.3 per cent rise on a year before, according to figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. UK new car sales for 1992 at 1.59m were virtually unchanged from the very depressed level of the previous year and were 31 per cent below the peak sales of 2.3m in 1989. There were tentative signs that demand had begun to recover in the final months of last year, however, and new car registrations have been higher than a year earlier in five of the last six months. Registrations of new commercial vehicles in January rose 4.4 per cent to 17,418, which was also the fourth consecutive monthly year-on-year increase. Daf, the beleaguered Anglo-Dutch truck maker that collapsed into receivership this week, was the clear UK truck market leader in January, with a share of 25.4 per cent. In the UK new car market both Ford and Vauxhall, the market leaders, lost ground heavily in January while Citroen, Renault and Peugeot all made significant gains, as did Rover, Toyota, Nissan, Volkswagen and Audi. Sales of Japanese makes in January were 32.9 per cent higher than a year before, which boosted their share to 11.2 per cent.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UK REGISTRATIONS OF NEW CARS January 1993  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                              Volume    Volume    Share (%)   Share (%)                             (Units)  Change (%)   Jan 93      Jan 92  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL MARKET                164,939     +7.3      100.0       100.0 UK produced                  74,400     +2.9       45.1        47.0 Imports                      90,539    +11.2       54.9        53.0 Japanese makes               18,475    +32.9       11.2         9.0 MANUFACTURERS: Ford group                   36,438     -6.7       22.1        25.5  -Ford                       35,740     -7.2       21.7        25.1  -Jaguar                        698    +24.4        0.4         0.4 General Motors               28,669     -9.5       17.4        20.5  -Vauxhall                   27,671     -9.7       16.8        19.9  -Saab*                         985     +2.0        0.6         0.6  -Lotus                          13    -80.3        0.0         0.0 Peugeot group                24,078    +26.3       14.6        12.5  -Peugeot                    13,561     +9.6        8.2         8.1  -Citroen                    10,517    +57.4        6.4         4.4 Rover**                      22,465    +22.3       13.6        12.0 Volkswagen group              8,984    +17.3        5.5         5.0  -Volkswagen                  6,136    +24.0        3.7         3.2  -Audi                        2,102    +37.0        1.3         1.0  -SEAT                          575    -20.6        0.4         0.5  -Skoda++                       171    -61.9        0.1         0.3 Renault+                      8,950    +31.6        5.4         4.0 Nissan                        6,494    +34.8        3.9         3.1 Toyota                        4,126    +23.4        2.5         2.2 BMW                           4,032    -15.7        2.4         3.1 Volvo*                        3,943    -10.6        2.4         2.9 Fiat group                    3,434    +24.1        2.0         1.7  -Fiat                        3,200    +27.2        1.9         1.6  -Lancia                         57     +0.0        0.0         0.0  -Alfa Romeo                    177     -9.2        0.1         0.1 Mercedes-Benz                 2,572    -12.8        1.6         1.9 Honda                         2,154    +22.2        1.3         1.2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *GM holds 50% of Saab Automobile and has management control. **Honda holds a 20 per cent stake in Rover vehicle operations.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An institution in these categories could only be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisionally certified if, in addition to meeting whatever  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions the Secretary might reasonably require of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisionally certified institution, the institution satisfied  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one of the following conditions. First, the institution, or one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or more persons or entities that the Secretary determines to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exercise substantial control over the institution, or both, would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have to submit to the Secretary financial guarantees in an amount  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined by the Secretary to be sufficient to satisfy the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's potential liabilities arising from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's participation in the Title IV, HEA programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, one or more persons or entities that the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determines to exercise substantial control over the institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would have to agree to be jointly or severally liable for any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liabilities arising from the institution's participation in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, HEA programs and any civil and criminal monetary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalties authorized under Title IV of the HEA. The law permits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Secretary to impose these conditions on these institutions;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Secretary is announcing that he would always impose them,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because these circumstances are indicative that extra protection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is needed for the institution and their students to be permitted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to benefit from the use of Title IV, HEA program funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Generally, provisional certification may be granted for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period of no longer than three award years. In accordance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 498(h) of the HEA, an institution that is applying for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initial participation may be provisionally certified for a period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of no longer than one award year. A participating institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that was accredited or preaccredited by a nationally recognized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accrediting agency on the day before the Secretary withdrew the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary's recognition of that agency may be provisionally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certified for no longer than 18 months after the date that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary withdrew that recognition. The Secretary has the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority to specify a shorter period of provisional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification, as necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with section 498(h) of the HEA, the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may revoke an institution's participation in the Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs, at any time before the end of a period of provisional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification, if the Secretary determines that the institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is unable to meet its responsibilities under its program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation agreement. If the Secretary makes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination, the Secretary would notify the institution of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination by mail, unless the Secretary chooses more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expeditious means, and revocation would take effect on date that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice is mailed. The institution would have to adhere to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of proposed &sect;668.26 which describes the consequences  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of revocation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the terms of the provisional certification, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution does not have the right to a formal appeal under subpart G of this part before the revocation takes effect. However, the Secretary proposes to allow the institution to submit a written request to reconsider the revocation within 20 days of the institution's receipt of the Secretary's notice,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> after the revocation takes effect. The institution's request for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reconsideration would have to include written evidence that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revocation is unwarranted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the Secretary decides that the revocation is unwarranted,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the institution's provisional certification would be reinstated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in accordance with the time, terms, and conditions set out in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's original provisional certification. If, after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consideration of the institution's submission, the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> denies the institution's request, the institution would not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permitted to reapply for participation in the Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs before at least 18 months after the revocation or the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expiration of any debarment or suspension of the institution,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whichever is later. Generally, an institution whose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation has been terminated because the institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisional certification was revoked would be able to apply for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reinstatement after 18 months. However, a debarment or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suspension under E.O. 12549 or the FAR can last 3 or more years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This change would eliminate any doubt that a debarred or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suspended institution may apply for reinstatement of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's participation during the period of a debarment or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suspension. The Secretary will not accept any application by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> debarred or suspended institution until the debarment or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suspension has expired or been removed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 668.14&blank;Program Participation Agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary proposes to redesignate &sect;668.12 as &sect;668.14.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This section includes provisions dealing with third-party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicers that were proposed in the NPRM published on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> February 17, 1994 (in part II). The Secretary will not repeat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the discussion of those provisions here.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

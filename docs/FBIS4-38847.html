			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Igor Cherevko: "No Boarding Without a Visa"] </F>   [Text] A visa requirement imposed by Lithuania to  transit its territory by passengers from other CIS states has  created serious problems in the relations between the October  Railroad and the Ukrainian Administration of Railroads.  Since this country imposed the visa regime, the St.  Petersburg-Lvov train, which transits Lithuania, has been empty  in both directions.    The Ukrainian Administration of Railroads asked the October  Railroad to resolve with the Republic of Lithuania the question  of repealing the transit visa requirement. There is a precedent:  Passengers on the St. Petersburg-Kaliningrad train do not need  such visas. The management of the Ukrainian Administration of  Railroads suggested that the October Railroad stop selling  tickets for this train until the problem with Lithuania is  settled.</p>

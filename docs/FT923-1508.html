			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Letter: Withdrawal from ERM stylish and result unwittingly good, but resignations an issue Sir, I think it is about time for some resignations from the ranks of the Treasury officials who advised the chancellor on (a) the rate at which sterling entered the ERM and (b) the purchase of about Pounds 7bn of foreign currency to support this rate. The path to a working European monetary union is simply bound to be hard because of our different cultures and national loyalties. Nevertheless, nothing has changed from last week and the idea of a united and integrated Europe remains a necessity if the majority of Europeans wants their children to live in a strong and civilised continent. This will not come easily and the events of the past week should not come as a surprise, but our political leaders and electorates are either prepared to grapple with these discomforts for the next 10 years, or else be submerged by periodic upheavals caused by national self-interest. As if the wars of 1914-18 and 1939-45 were not sufficient punishment. If European leaders keep calm, we shall all learn from this recent hiatus and grow even stronger, but there are undoubtedly more heartbreaks on the horizon. I disagree with your editorial 'Dancing amid the ruins' (September 19) in which you imply that the prime minister, Mr John Major, is tired and discredited. I just point the finger at the competence of the monetary and economic advice which both he and the chancellor and his predecessors have been receiving.

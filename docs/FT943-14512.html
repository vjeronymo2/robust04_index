			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / People: Higher and higher at Hyatt Yorkshireman Darryl Hartley-Leonard sounds like a character out of Kane and Abel, one of Jeffrey Archer's best-selling novels. Just 30 years after he found a job as a desk clerk in a Los Angeles Hyatt hotel, he has risen to be chairman of the privately-owned Hyatt Hotels Corporation, which oversees 103 establishments in North America and the Caribbean. Hartley-Leonard, 49, who takes over from Thomas Pritzker whose family owns the company, has managed hotels in Chicago, Houston and Atlanta. Pritzker remains president of the parent Hyatt Corporation. Since settling in the US, Hartley-Leonard has thrown himself into good causes, including Unicef and the Big Shoulders Fund, which supports Catholic schools in Chicago where Hyatt has its headquarters. He helped form the Hyatt Force (Family of Caring and Responsible Employees), which gives staff four days off each year to work in their communities. His enthusiasm has been spotted by Ron Brown, US Commerce Secretary, who has appointed him as an adviser on travel and tourism. Hartley-Leonard became president of Hyatt Hotels in 1986, with responsibility for their operations and development. His new post will leave him free to concentrate on longer-term strategic issues, including the company's decision to start franchising hotels, which is expected to begin in the next few months.</p>

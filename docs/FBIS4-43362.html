			<p>BFN     [Text] London, June 15 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslavia  (Serbia/Montenegro) is vitally interested in an immediate end of  war in its neighbourhood and will support every solution that  might be freely agreed upon by the nations of former Yugoslavia,  Serbian Parliament Speaker Dragan Tomic and Montenegrin Prime  Minister Milo Djukanovic told British members of Parliament on  Wednesday [15 June].    The Serbian and Montenegrin officials were conferring in  London with members of the British-Yugoslav parliamentary group  which comprises representatives of all British parliamentary  parties.    The international community must support political talks and  not war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, said Tomic and explained that  Yugoslavia upholds the latest European plan for [word  indistinct] wracked Bosnia, as it provides for a countrywide  cessation of hostilities as a precondition for a political  settlement.    The world must, however, exercise its influence primarily  with the Moslem side which is obviously seeking ways to prolong  the war, said Tomic.    He informed the group that the U.N. Security Council's  sanctions against Yugoslavia, imposed because of the country's  alleged involvement in the Bosnian war, have cost the country  $45 billion and are a threat to the region as a whole.    Montenegrin Prime Minister Djukanoviv said that with the  sanctions, the world is punishing only those who wished to  protect their country. The sanctions are impermissible also  because they are based on the policy of force and threats, which  cannot be the foundation on which to build the new world order,  he said.    He explained that the sanctions are being implemented more  strictly than the United Nations intended, and in illustration  mentioned the problem of importing medicines, which are supposed  to be exempt from the sanctions.    Djukanovic said it is paradoxical that Yugoslavia is being  ignored by the world at a time when very powerful democratic  processes, deeper than ever before, are under way in the country.    Tomic and Djukanovic condemned war crimes and those who have  committed them. [words indistinct] vowed Tomic.    The hosts agreed with the Yugoslav officials that there is  still no readiness in the world to help create the conditions  for lasting peace by according equal treatment to all warring  sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following summarizes the major changes in this notice of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rulemaking (NPRM):  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Part 668_Student Assistance General Provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 668.1&blank;Scope.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Part 668 governs the administration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Title IV, HEA programs by an institution and provides for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> various enforcement measures against institutions for any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violations of program requirements by the institution or its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agents. A third-party servicer, as an agent of an institution,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must currently apply the requirements of part 668 to administer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> properly the Title IV, HEA programs on behalf of an institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposes to specify that the requirements of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Student Assistance General Provisions regulations would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applied to a third-party servicer (as proposed to be defined in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;668.2) to the extent that the servicer administers any aspect of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an institution's participation in a Title IV, HEA program. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal would enable the Secretary, for the first time, to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directly oversee the conduct of third-party servicers. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary also proposes to make clear that although the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would hold a third-party servicer responsible for compliance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable regulations, an institution that contracts with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer always remains responsible for the servicer's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance. This clarification merely restates the Department of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Education's long-standing policy and requirements with respect to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutional responsibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 668.2&blank;General definitions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations would incorporate the statutory definition of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party servicer in section 481(f) of the HEA. Under that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition (as amended by the Higher Education Technical Amendments of 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;208), enacted on December 20,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1993), a third-party servicer is an ``individual, or any State, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> private, profit or nonprofit organization'' that contracts with an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligible institution to administer any aspect of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's participation in a Title IV, HEA program. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statutory definition includes additional elements applicable to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party servicer's administration of the FFEL programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These aspects of the definition are addressed in a subsequent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussion on 34 CFR part 682.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary also proposes to include as part of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition of third-party servicer examples of services which a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party servicer could provide to an institution that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary considers to constitute the administration of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's participation in a Title IV, HEA program. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary believes that examples are necessary to alert those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individuals and organizations that contract with an eligible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution of the specific activities that would be subject to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the requirements proposed in these regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The examples that the Secretary proposes to include in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition of third-party servicer are primarily examples that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> show an obvious relationship to the administration of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary proposes these examples to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifically detail which activities unequivocally constitute the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administration of an institution's participation in the Title IV,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HEA programs. While these examples are not all-inclusive, they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> do provide a baseline to judge other activities that could be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deemed an aspect of the administration of an institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation in the Title IV, HEA programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary also proposes to include another set of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examples that the Secretary believes do not constitute the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administration of an institution's participation in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, HEA programs. For example, the Secretary does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consider the activity of publishing ability-to-benefit (ATB)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tests to be a third-party servicer activity because publishers of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ATB tests do not contract with institutions and under the statute  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would not fall within the definition of a third-party servicer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As another example, the Secretary does not consider  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performing activities as a Multiple Data Entry Processor (MDE) to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be included in the scope of third-party servicer activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While an MDE could be considered to administer certain aspects of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an institution's participation in the Title IV, HEA programs, an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MDE is bound by other Department of Education requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the Secretary does not believe it necessary to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> separately regulate MDE activities as part of these proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In general, the Secretary also proposes to exclude auditing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities from the scope of these regulations. Entities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performing audits are required to be impartial and independent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entities with no vested interest in the Title IV, HEA programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, while auditors provide services needed to comply with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, HEA requirements, their services are not directly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> connected to the day-to-day administration of Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assistance. The Secretary, therefore, believes that auditing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities should not be included in the scope of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other proposed examples classified as being outside the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scope of these regulatory requirements simply reinforce the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary's belief that certain activities performed by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party servicer that do not substantially affect the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delivery of Title IV, HEA program aid do not constitute the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administration of an institution's participation in the Title IV,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HEA programs, (for example, contracting to warehouse records).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result of deliberations during the negotiated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking sessions, Federal and non-Federal negotiators  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concluded that it was not necessary to include or exclude  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> computer services or software providers from the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition of third-party servicer or the examples provided. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negotiators concluded that computer software and computer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services are simply technological means to assist in carrying out  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific administrative functions. Accordingly, the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> invites public comment on whether an individual, State, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organization providing computer software and services represented  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to satisfy Title IV, HEA program requirements should specifically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be included in what the Secretary considers to constitute a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party servicer's administration of an eligible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's participation in a Title IV, HEA program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

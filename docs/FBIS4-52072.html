			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] On 4 May, the people, in cooperation with the  National Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK], successfully  attacked the 11th Division, which was made up of the communist  Vietnamese and U.S.-backed puppets, in the Kulen district seat.  The people and NADK also jointly attacked the invading forces  at various positions in Kulen District and others in Preah  Vihear Province.    This was retaliation against the invasion by the communist  Vietnamese and U.S.-backed puppets against the NADK and  Cambodian people.    After two days of fighting on 3 and 4 May, the people and  NADK have smashed and completely liberated the area around the  11th Division. They currently occupy the Kulen district seat.

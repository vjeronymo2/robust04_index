			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For a more complete statement of the facts and representations supporting the Department's decision to grant this exemption, refer to the notice of proposed exemption published on April 22, 1994 at 59 FR 19255. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> WRITTEN COMMENTS:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The Department received one written comment and no requests for a hearing. The written comment was submitted on behalf of the Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association (the Applicant), and it addresses two points which are summarized as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Section 6 in the summary of facts and representations in the notice of proposed exemption (the Summary) commences with the following statement: ``The Bank proposes to take advantage of opportunities to direct the cross-trading of securities directly between the Funds, or directly with other client accounts for which the Bank is the investment manager, or with mutual funds or institutional accounts for which the Bank is the investment advisor.'' However, the Applicant points out that the proposed exemption does not provide exemptive relief as broad as that reflected in the statement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department notes that the appearance of the aforementioned statement in the Summary is an error. The Applicant did not request, and the Department did not propose, exemptive relief for the Funds' cross-trade transactions with ``other client accounts for which the Bank is the investment manager, or with mutual funds or institutional accounts for which the Bank is the investment advisor.'' Despite the erroneous appearance of the aforementioned statement in the Summary, the Department notes that the operative language of the proposed exemption included only transactions between Index Funds and/or Model Driven Funds (the Funds), and between the Funds and Large Plans (as defined in Part I, Section (e) of the proposed exemption), including the purchase and sale of common stock of BAC. Like the proposed exemption, the final exemption is restricted to those transactions defined and identified in Parts I through IV of the exemption, which do not include transactions with ``other client accounts for which the Bank is the investment manager, or with mutual funds or institutional accounts for which the Bank is the investment advisor.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The Applicant notes a typographical error in Section 9 of the Summary: The reference to rule 10b&hyph;189, in the second paragraph, line 10, should read as a reference to SEC Rule 10b&hyph;18. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDITIONS:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> In this final exemption the Department has included a new condition (g) in Part I_Exemption for Cross-Trading Between Certain Funds, which was inadvertently omitted from the notice of proposed exemption. Condition (g) requires the Bank of America to provide certain information regarding its cross-trading program to employee benefit plans which invest in the Funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After consideration of the entire record, including the Applicant's comment, the Department has determined to grant the exemption.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Ronald Willett of the Department, telephone (202) 219&hyph;8881.

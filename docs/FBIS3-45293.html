			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, January 14 (XINHUA) -- Russian President  Boris Yeltsin said today that the U.S. proposal on establishing  a "partnership for peace" with former Eastern Bloc countries may  prove only "one of the scenarios for building a new Europe."    Speaking at a joint press conference with U.S. President  Bill  Clinton, Yeltsin said Russia will "keep track" of other security  structures in Europe, including the United Nations and the  Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE).    Yeltsin also said that one should not be fearful of  "imperial  ambitions" in Russia, because Russia is only interested in  stability, and will try to eliminate the chance of conflict  along the new borders between former Soviet republics.    He complained of the failure of some countries to respond to  Russia's proposal for ending the conflicts in Nagorno-Karabakh  and Tajikstan.    Yeltsin also warned that a "double standard" should not be  used by Western countries in their relations with Russia and the  Baltic republics.    "No double standard should be allowed here... in Haiti or  the  Baltics," he said. "To that end we adopted a very forceful  declaration on securing human rights... so that no more  discrimination will be allowed against the Russian-speaking  population in the Baltics."</p>

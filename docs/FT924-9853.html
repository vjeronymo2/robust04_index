			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Consumers' Association joins disapproval of Dan-Air deal THE CHORUS of disapproval at the government's decision not to refer British Airways' takeover of Dan-Air to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission gathered force yesterday with the Consumers' Association slating the outcome. 'We are appalled,' said Mr Derek Prentice, assistant director. 'It reduces competition. When consumers have less choice, they lose out.' Mr Prentice and Sir Michael Bishop, chairman of British Midland, both said that it might have been better for competition if Dan-Air had gone bust. In that case several airlines could have enhanced their scheduled networks by picking up the popular routes, rather than allowing 'the dominant airline to grow even more dominant,' as Mr Prentice put it. Sir Michael contended that the government had had 'the wool pulled over its eyes by BA' and had swept competition issues under the carpet. The decision simply helped BA to cut its costs, and hence its losses, at Gatwick. The result was a commercial benefit to BA. He argued that fewer jobs would have been lost if Dan-Air had collapsed and its routes taken on by several airlines. 'The more airlines participate, the more jobs because staff are duplicated and you don't get the benefits of scale.' He referred to the Civil Aviation Authority's view that the takeover raised serious competition issues - although the CAA did not go so far as to recommend referral to the MMC. Aggrieved competitors, which also include Virgin Atlantic and Air UK, are taking legal advice on whether the government's decision can be challenged. They are also calling for an independent watchdog body that might be called 'Ofair', similar to the regulators of privatised utilities. A longer term thrust is to seek changes to the rules affecting slots at Heathrow so that BA's hold on about 38 per cent of them might be weakened. BA replied that other airlines had had the chance to do a deal with Davies &amp; Newman, Dan-Air's parent, but it was the only one prepared to mount a rescue. Its establishment of a low-cost operation at Gatwick would benefit consumers and its post-merger 21 per cent share of that airport's slots did not amount to domination. Jobs had been saved and redundancy packages were better than in a liquidation, trade creditors had been protected and many travellers' plans had not been wrecked. BAA, Gatwick's landlord, stressed that it would be good for the airport to have BA, with its international marketing clout, as a big operator.</p>

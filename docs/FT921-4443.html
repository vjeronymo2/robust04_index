			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: San Paolo di Torino Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino seems to have involved so many advisers in its L1.525 trillion equity offering that objective views in the market are few and far between. That is a pity because the price of L12,200 a share looks dear, even though it is at the low end of previous indications. There is no doubting the quality of the bank or its ability to exploit liberalisation of Italy's antiquated financial system, but Italian bank earnings are likely to be hit by economic downturn this year. Even on an optimistic assessment of 1992 prospects, the shares are being offered for a forward multiple in excess of 11. That compares with a ratio close to 8 for Credito Italiano and Banca Commerciale Italiana. The low multiple of the latter two partly reflects weakness of their share prices as investors made room for the San Paolo offering. Doubtless institutions buying to build up a weighting in the stock will console themselves with the thought that the offer price is also close to net asset value after the revaluation of property and other assets allowed under the Amato law on bank reform. Mediobanca is expected to stabilise the market in the wake of the flotation, but it will be a while before the bank lives up to the demands of the offer multiple. In the meantime, the yield on Italian government bonds is some 8 percentage points higher.</p>

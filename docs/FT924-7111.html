			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Personal View: Omissions on options The present controversy concerning directors' remuneration has neglected one aspect of the total package: executive share option schemes (Esops). For schemes to be effective, they must tie directors' interests to earnings per share (EPS) growth, ensuring the decisions they make are in the best interests of shareholders. Unfortunately, our research indicates not all is what it should be in the way some companies operate their schemes, and this is often hidden by the poor levels of disclosure in annual reports. The four issues we have identified are discounting, voluntary lapsing, pre-emption and the lack of adequate disclosure of information pertaining to share option schemes in company annual reports. It is possible to discount the price at which directors can buy options by up to a limit of 15 per cent on the market price on the day the option is granted, the argument being that it encourages executives to establish an equity interest in the company. Yet if the object of an Esop is to motivate directors to work towards increasing the EPS of the company, it seems curious to award the director an immediate 15 per cent discount for achieving nothing. The National Association of Pension Funds (NAPF) and the Association of British Insurers (ABI) have raised the problem of pre-emption. By allowing directors and other employees to buy share options, the percentage of the total issued share capital held by other shareholders falls, and this represents a steady dilution of their holding. Then there is the problem of voluntary lapsing. Under most Esops, directors are permitted to lapse voluntarily any grant of options they have been allocated. Assuming the directors have not used their full allocation of options, the implication is that, if they manage the company poorly and the share price falls, they can lapse their options and be reallocated another tranche up to the balance of their allocation at a lower exercise price. If exercised at the right time, this would render relatively greater profits, and invalidate any notion of incentive-based performance tied to a steadily growing EPS. The directors should be able to show that profits are derived from a healthier company than when the options were initially granted, not from a randomly fluctuating share price. There have also been calls for more appropriate explication in the annual reports. In the majority of annual reports, share option prices and the number of share options held by directors are given in different tables, making it impossible to calculate who owns what and how much they are making. Furthermore, options are not counted as a cost to the company. Studies in the US have shown that the cost of Esops if charged against profits would reduce them by an average of 3 per cent and sometimes by up to 10 per cent. Indeed, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has tightened regulations pertaining to disclosure requirements for Esops. However, issues of executive remuneration have little impact on the making of investment decisions, and this has been reflected in the lack of emphasis that the NAPF and the ABI have placed until recently on these kinds of issues. These organisations increasingly recognise the need to improve ways of measuring executive performance, and have now set out detailed guidelines concerning Esops which go some way in addressing the issues of discounting, pre-emption and lapsing. They have also recognised that EPS as a measure of company performance is vulnerable to manipulation and other measures should be incorporated. However, the information on executive remuneration rarely trickles down to the fund managers who ultimately should be the monitors of companies' remuneration packages. Moreover, they are often unconcerned or ignorant of corporate governance issues, and rarely use their proxy votes anyway. This demonstrates the need for the ABI and NAPF guidelines to be dovetailed with any conclusions the Cadbury Committee on corporate governance might reach when it publishes the conclusions next month. Any overall policy should be rigorously implemented by the institutional investors, specifically at the fund manager level. Otherwise there will be a danger that directors will be perceived as discerning no limits on their remuneration. This perception may be exacerbated because of the unsatisfactory levels of disclosure in annual reports. The Institute of Directors takes the view that the scale of risk that directors carry is such that any compensation is insignificant compared with the scale of economic activity. But can this view be used to justify curtailing the incentive element of an incentive-based emolument by the discounting and lapsing of options, or as a recent study* shows, increasing executive remuneration against collapsing profits?

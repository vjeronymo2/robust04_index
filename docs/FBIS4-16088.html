			<p>BFN     [Text] The chairman of the Popular Movement of Belarus  [NDB], Syarhey Haydukevich, has publicized a statement relating  to the NATO air attacks on Serbian positions in the area of  Gorazde. The statement reads: "The Popular Movement is  indignant at the flagrant aggression launched by the U.S.  military against fraternal Slavic Serbia under the UN banner.  We lodge a resolute protest against this action, which  threatens the entire world with catastrophe." The NDB demands a  stop to "the destruction of the proud and fraternal-to-us  Serbian people," as well as lifting of the economic blockade on  the Socialist [as received] Federative Republic of Yugoslavia,  which brings about "incalculable losses to Belarusian economy  and trade." The NDB also demands that the Belarusian Government  establish diplomatic relations with the Socialist Federative  Republic of Yugoslavia, and that Belarusian representatives to  the United Nations introduce a resolution banning the use of  armed forces in crisis spots around the world.</p>

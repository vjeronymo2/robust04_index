			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Observer: Honour of the road Eric Broadley, the crusty chairman of Lola Cars and an elder statesman on Britain's racing car circuit, has been having an unusually good week. On Sunday, Nigel Mansell, the former grand prix world champion, won his first IndyCar race in one of Broadley's Lolas. Yesterday Broadley took to the podium and picked up the Castrol Institute of the Motor Industry annual gold medal for 'outstanding' achievements in road transport. Admittedly, he was receiving the award not on behalf of Lola but for the entire UK motor sport industry. It now employs 50,000, produces 90 per cent of the world's racing cars - and made a net positive contribution of Pounds 400m to the UK's balance of trade last year. With a record like that how long will it be before John Major starts rewarding a few of these knights of the road?</p>

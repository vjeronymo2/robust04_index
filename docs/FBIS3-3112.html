			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Wang Yong: "China Wants U.S. Project </F> Aid"]    [Text] China will seek American investment in about 800  industrial and agricultural projects next month at a Washington  conference on bilateral trade, coming less than two months  before a U.S. decision on Chinese trade status.    This will be the largest promotion campaign staged by China  in the United States in the past 15 years, the Ministry of  Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation (Moftec) announced  yesterday.    About 60 of the proposed projects will be hydraulic and  thermal power stations that are expected to relieve China's  electricity bottleneck, a Moftec spokesman said.    Another 100 projects are related to the construction of  roads, railways, airports and wharfs. The remaining 500 fall  into machinery, electronics, petrochemical, metallurgical,  husbandry and forestry.    About 200 people from the State Council (China's cabinet),  China Petrochemical Corporation, China North Industries Group,  China National Petroleum Corporation and 25 provinces and cities  will tour the U.S. for investment promotion.    The U.S. has become one of the top three foreign investors  in  China with promised capital input in more than 1,000 projects  valued at more than $6 billion.    Chinese analysts predict U.S. investors will continue to  land  here as the two countries are apparently improving their  economic relations.    And many international trade observers have predicted that  the U.S. will extend its most-favoured-nation (MFN) status to  China this year, which provides Chinese goods with the lowest  tariffs.    China has insisted that the cancellation of MFN will  definitely cast a pall over bilateral relations and business  communities of both sides will be hurt.    President Jiang Zemin reaffirmed on Sunday in his talks with  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher that differences in  social systems and ideologies should not obstruct mutual  co-operation.    "And the impending trade forum in the U.S. will provide a  better chance for U.S. businesses to locate investment  opportunities in China," the Moftec spokesman said.    The forum is to accompany a high-level conference in  Washington with Chinese Foreign Trade Minister Wu Yi and U.S.  Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown.    The conference and the trade forum are timed before the U.S.  decision on MFN status in June.    China has managed to get the status as mutual means for the  development of Sino-U.S. bilateral trade.</p>

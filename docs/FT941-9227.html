			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Industry pay deals edge up to 2.6% Manufacturing wage settlements edged up to 2.6 per cent for the three months to January, the Confederation of British Industry said yesterday, Robert Taylor writes. This was a slight rise on the 2.2 per cent recorded for the three months to December but lower than the 2.7 per cent in the same period a year earlier. The CBI said the range of settlements continued to be wide. As many as 41.9 per cent of deals in manufacturing were worth 2.5 per cent or less, and just 8.1 per cent awarded pay rises of more than 4.5 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in  Russian at 1625 GMT on 23 May carries a 15-minute "Details"  program featuring Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Liberal  Democratic Party of Russia, LDPR. This "Details" edition is in  response to criticism from the LDPR that the program's announcer  Nikolay Svanidze, in a previously edition, said Zhirinovskiy  allegedly paid 500 dollars to each member of the LDPR faction to  get them to vote for the country's budget.    The program starts with a clip containing Svanidze's earlier  comment on the Zhirinovskiy bribes, followed by a three-and-half  minute introductory question by Svanidze to today's guest,  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, who chews his lips, shuffles papers, and  tries to interrupt Svanidze's introduction several times.    Svanidze asks how much truth there is in various, sometimes  outlandish, rumors circulating about Zhirinovskiy and his party,  and why Zhirinovskiy is so upset at the suggestion of his  bribing his deputies. To this Zhirinovskiy replies:    "Moscow courts are inundated with our cases about the  defense  of honor and dignity, my personal dignity, and that of the  party. We keep on protesting.    "For the first time in six months you have given me an  opportunity to speak here, and only after a measure by the  entire faction, when we left the conference hall of the State  Duma. In such situations some political figures or even mass  media people would resign. The only thing that has happeened so  far in our country is that you have finally graciously permitted  the leader of a party with a big electoral victory, the leader  of the largest party faction, to come here and explain himself  in the light of your untruthful accusations. Ninety percent of  what has been said about the party in the five months since our  electoral victory is lies. Ten percent of those rumors are  correct."    Zhirinovskiy goes on to criticize every level of government  for not providing him and his party with appropriate offices in  the center of Moscow, saying that even petty criminals have  better accommodation than the LDPR.    He then goes on to reply to the second part of the  introductory question regarding the alleged bribes, saying:    "Well then. No member of the party has received or will ever  receive anything from me. You have said that I gave them 500  dollars each. I would not have given even 500 rubles. I will  never pay anyone, not even Moscow functionaries. You have told  such a lie, such an despicable accusation, and not only against  me. You said I paid them, and thus you have insulted the entire  faction, the entire party. You spat in the face of almost 13  million voters, who voted for us because we are the most honest  group of deputies."    Zhirinovskiy goes on to repeat the same thing several times  over, then shouts at Svanidze:    "You tell me, why is it that all the media, including  Ostankino, ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI, the Moscow channel, and all the  others, always slander the party? Why is it? We are depicted  as fascists, ultra-right wing. Is any of it contained in the  party program? You tell me, why is it that you lot, the TV  journalists, slander not only me and my party but also the  entire country?"    Svanidze replies that even if he wanted to, which is not the  case, he never would have been able to spit in the face of 13  million people. As for the media in general, he says  Zhirinovskiy often is himself the cause of various rumors.    Svanidze then suggests Zhirinovskiy is trying to present his  comment as an insult to the Duma, and then plays a clip in which  Zhirinovskiy himself says the Duma has many corrupt deputies.  To this Zhirinovskiy replies, shouting at times, that this is  all true. According to him, the Central Electoral Commission  has discovered that various democratic parties and groups have  been supported by what Zhirinovskiy calls "Western intelligence  services." He then accuses Svanidze, the media, and everyone in  general of not having the guts to accept the fact that his party  is the most popular one -- and the cheapest as well.    Svanidze replies: "Yes, I understand now that the only clean  and cheap deputies, as you say, belong to the LDPR faction." He  reminds Zhirinovskiy, quoting one of his own recent speeches,  that he likes to deliberately deceive voters, especially women,  peasants, and certain national minorities, for their own good.  He then suggests the reason Zhirinovskiy is so upset about the  accusation of bribery is simply because he is looking for a  scandal, as scandals are much more amusing than the daily  dreariness of the Duma, and at any rate, Zhirinovskiy is a  natural when it comes to scandals.    Amid much shouting and arm-waving from both men,  Zhirinovskiy  replies that lying is simply an electoral tactic, that there is  nothing wrong with it. The rest of his reply is lost in  simultaneous shouting from both men and the program ends.</p>

			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: ACIL denied appeal in option case AUSTRALIAN Consolidated Investments (ACIL), the investment company which owns the former Bell Resources, has been refused leave to appeal against a Court of Appeal decision in favour of bondholders earlier this year. The dispute arose when bondholders tried to exercise a put option for early repayment of principal at 117.7 per cent of par value on November 13, 1991. Instead, bonds were redeemed at only 103 per cent of their par value when the company exercised its call option. The decision means the company must repay investors the remaining 14.7 per cent plus interest.</p>

Speaking during a visit to  an army unit on Monday, he said there was a revival of patriotic  feelings in the nation and that latest developments indicated  the ability by the Azeris and their army to defend their own  lands."    Aliyev spoke of military successes notched up by the army on  the frontlines of Fizuli, Kelbajar, Agdam and Agderin  (Mardakert) recently and the nation's pride and joy over those  achievements.    At the same time, the President said that Baku was opposed  to  war and still committed to a peaceful solution to the conflict.  However, the Armenian army continues aggression against  Azerbaijan by launching new offensives, he said.    Aliyev pledged commitment to further efforts for a  negotiated  settlement to the conflict saying appropriate contacts were  under way to this end including Armenia. But he warned against  further Armenian aggression saying his country would have no  other option but to recover lost territory by force if that was  not stopped.    The President called on Yerevan to relinquish the occupied  territories of its own accord, withdraw its troops and respect  the sovereignty and integrity of Azerbaijan. The war will end  if the Armenian government fulfils those conditions, Aliyev said.</p>

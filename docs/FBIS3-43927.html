Mr. Etienne Tshisekedi's ghost city campaign seems to  doing very well in Kinshasa. No one bothered to go to work on  the morning of 19 January. Things have been flaring up around  the transitional prime minister's residence, which was  surrounded by the Presidential Guard at daybreak. Several Union  for Democracy and Social Progress -- Tshisekedi's party --  activists immediately responded to defend their leader. Here  is an account by Djouko Moulopo, the charge d'affaires of the  permanent representation of Tshisekedi's government in Brussels.    [Begin Moulopo recording] The ghost city campaign launched  by the opposition in protest against President Mobutu's illegal  and anti constitutional acts has been followed totally by the  population. At the moment, we fear for the prime minister's  life because we have been informed from Kinshasa that the prime  minister's residence has been totally surrounded by the (?DSP)  and the (?ZARM) [expansion unknown]. Combatants are protecting  the prime minister and exchanging fire with the soldiers. This  is the situation as it stands in Kinshasa. Army troops are  positioned at strategic points. [end recording]    This renewed tension jeopardizes the 19 January meeting  convened by President Mobutu between the High Council of the  Republic and the National Assembly, which should lead to the  merger of the two organs and the election of a new prime  minister. The choice is between Mr. Tshisekedi and Mr. Mulumba  Lukoji. As Djouko Moulopo points out in no uncertain terms, the  radical opposition is not at all happy about this:    [Begin Moulopo recording] President Mobutu has no right or  freedom to convene the High Council of Republic. If he had  convened his former assembly, we would understand that, but  Monsignor Monsengwo has declared that he did not have to fall in  line with President Mobutu's position, because it is an anti  constitutional act, which is not laid down in the transitional  act on the provisions for the new constitution in Zaire.  Therefore in our view, there is no High Council of the Republic  in Zaire today. [end recording]</p>

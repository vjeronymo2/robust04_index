			<p><P> May 8, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OJAI;  </P> <P> REQUEST FOR SIGNAL AT SCHOOL IS REJECTED  </P> <P> One death and one seriously injured student do not warrant the cost of  installing a traffic signal in front of Nordhoff High School on California 33,  Caltrans has told Ojai officials.  </P> <P> Councilman Joseph DeVito said the City Council will discuss tonight whether to  appeal the California Department of Transportation decision or find other ways  to finance the $18,000 project.  </P> <P> A Caltrans study of pedestrian traffic showed that only 35 cross the highway in  a two-hour period, five fewer than required to justify a signal, said Peter  Hsu, a Caltrans traffic engineer.  </P> <P> However, city officials said Caltrans only counted people using one of the  three crosswalks in front of the school.  </P> <P> About 175 residents have signed petitions calling for a signal at the school.  </P> <P> State Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara) and County Supervisor Maggie Erickson  joined the city in asking the state to put in a warning signal after a  16-year-old Ojai girl was seriously injured when a car hit her while she  crossed the highway in October. Another teen-ager died in 1986 after being hit  by a car in front of the school. THIA BELL  </P></p>

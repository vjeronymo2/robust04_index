			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (5): Sales are likely to rise  -'Exits' remain hard to find A successful buy-out team seeking to raise new funds has had little choice in recent years. Its only real option has been to sell out to a corporate buyer, and face losing the independence which made the buy-out an attractive idea in the first place. But the past 12 months have seen a considerable change in investors' attitudes, and the number of former buy-outs obtaining a stock market listing has risen sharply. Buy-out companies accounted for one in five of all new companies coming to the stock market in the first six months of 1993, the highest proportion ever. Nottingham University's Centre for Management Buy-Out Research recorded 13 flotations of buy-out and buy-in companies in the first six months of 1993, compared with 11 in the whole of 1992 and four in 1991. The main reason for this change in sentiment has been the far more positive view now taken of smaller company shares. Smaller companies performed poorly in the depths of the recession, but are now expected to return to above-average levels of growth. This has meant that buy-out companies have been able to command attractive price/earnings ratios, typically around 17 or 18, at listing. At the same time, corporate buyers, which in recent years have been able to pay highly to acquire buy-out companies, have withdrawn from the bidding. Many have been devoting all of their energies to surviving the recession, and have had little time to devote to acquisitions. Welcome though this increase in the number of listings is, there is still a long way to go before new-issue activity matches the levels attained in the mid-1980s. In 1986, 37 buy-out/buy-in companies went to market, while in the following year there were 35 listings. And while failure rates among buy-outs have declined over the past year, receivership remains the single most common form of 'exit'. No fewer than 41 buy-outs failed in the first six months of 1993, compared with 28 trade sales and 13 flotations, according to the MBO research centre. Receivership numbers began rising sharply in the late 1980s, to peak at 121 in 1991. Despite the emphasis which venture capitalists place on finding an exit opportunity, remarkably few buy-outs have achieved one over the past decade or so. Even when receiverships and refinancings (second round buy-outs or buy-ins) are included, only 23 per cent of the buy-outs completed between 1981 and 1991 obtained an exit. Ten per cent went to trade buyers, while 4.4 per cent were floated. This indicates that a large 'rump' of buy-outs remain under the control of the managers who acquired them. Many will be small buy-outs financed largely by bank debt, where there is no great pressure to achieve an exit, or companies where the managers own most of the equity. Others will have shown a mediocre trading performance, and would not obtain an attractive price if they were put up for sale. Despite this surprising failure on the part of the buy-out industry to achieve exits, there is likely to be increasing pressure over the next few years. As many of the 10-year venture capital partnerships set up in the early and mid-1980s come to the end of their lives, their managers will need to realise their investments. This could lead to an increase in the sale of businesses. The growing trade in second-hand venture capital portfolios is likely to speed up this trend. The manager who made the original investment, but now sees it on his books at a lower valuation, will be reluctant to crystallise his loss. If the portfolio is sold, the new manager can review each investment more dispassionately and take a decision to sell when necessary. Many of the companies which obtained a stock market listing in the late 1980s turned out to be too small to attract much investor interest. They were neglected by analysts and market makers alike, and there was little liquidity in their shares. Some of the recent buy-out flotations have been of more substantial businesses. Devro, a maker of sausage skins, was capitalised at Pounds 224m; Holliday Chemical Holdings at Pounds 161m; and RJB Mining at Pounds 103m. But a surprising number have still been small. Of 36 venture capital-backed companies floated in the year ended June 1993 (half of them buy-outs), nine were capitalised at less than Pounds 20m, while 11 were valued at between Pounds 20m and Pounds 50m, according to the British Venture Capital Association. In contrast to the revival of investor interest in new issues, the London Stock Exchange has announced plans to dismantle the Unlisted Securities Market in 1996. The USM did well during the boom years of the late 1980s, but more recently has suffered from a negative image. On top of this, the loosening of regulations governing the main market has reduced the need for a separate set of rules for the newer company. Meanwhile, in continental Europe, many of the secondary markets set up in imitation of the USM, have failed to establish viable trading volumes. But although it is now easier to obtain a main market listing in London, the venture capital industry and many City organisations are keen to maintain a facility for listing the smaller company. They have put together an organisation known as the City Group for Smaller Companies to lobby for their interests. The European Venture Capital Association, for its part, plans to put proposals to the European Commission for a market for venture-backed companies, though it is not yet clear whether this will be on a Europe-wide basis or with a national focus. The creation of an efficient market for trading in the shares of smaller companies is vitally important for the venture capital industry. As part of its efforts to reinforce the status of venture capital, it is currently attempting to persuade the institutions to treat such investments as a separate asset class. A successful record of achieving exits is vital if it is to achieve this goal.</p>

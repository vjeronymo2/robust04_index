			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Technology: Watson is on the case The growing number of students at Britain's universities are finding it more difficult to keep in touch with each other. The student unions at the universities of Brighton and Sussex are the first to try to combat the problem with pocket pagers. From January, students at the two universities, both sited in Brighton, will be able to rent pagers to receive messages about student union meetings, entertainment and information from local companies. There will be messages broadcast to all students - which band is playing on Saturday night, say - and messages to members of particular clubs or societies. The pagers will also be used to carry individual messages. Brighton was chosen as the first site for the service because the two colleges were trying to work together, says Rosalind Macfarlane, marketing manager of Higher Education Communication (HEC), the service provider. Other universities will get Watson - derived from the expression 'What's On' - in the 1994-95 academic year. The Brighton students will be able rent the alphanumeric pagers, which can carry messages of up to 96 characters, for Pounds 10 a term. Jeremy Oates, director of HEC, says his aim is to make money out of the service, and to do that Watson will need one large sponsor - possibly a bank  -and advertising from several local companies. Oates also reckons that the cost of the pagers will have to be written off. 'I believe we'll see the pagers go out, but I don't believe we'll see them come back.'</p>

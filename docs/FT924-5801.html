			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Latin American market still strong: Saleroom ONE sector of the art world continues to go from strength to strength - Latin American paintings. At Sotheby's in New York on Monday there were eight artist records including Dollars 1.54m (Pounds 1m) for La Casa de las Gemelas Arias by Fernando Botero, showing a group of girls and clients in a Colombian brothel. Another record was the Dollars 1.485m which secured Mujer en Extasis by Rufino Tamayo. It depicts a reclining woman who is almost transformed into a Mexican landscape. The evening sale totalled Dollars 10.46m and was over 90 per cent sold by value. The Russian cellist Rostropovich paid the top price of Pounds 49,500 in a Russian picture sale at Sotheby's in London yesterday. He bought Faces of Russia, painted by Grigoriev in 1917. The price was below estimate but the auction did quite well, totalling Pounds 514,217 with 17 per cent unsold in the morning session. Russian art has been in deep recession for the last two years. Christie's experienced mixed fortunes with its sale of clocks and watches. It totalled Pounds 649,385 but was 33 per cent unsold.</p>

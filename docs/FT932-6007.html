			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Arts body may face strong criticism THE NATIONAL Heritage Department is likely to publish this week findings from a report which it is believed strongly criticises certain aspects of Arts Council activities, Gary Mead writes. The report, by management consultants Price Waterhouse, will be presented to the council on Thursday. Its findings are likely to be made public the following day. The study is part of the government's attempts to bring greater efficiency to the public sector through its market-testing programme, which looks into ways the non-core activities of quangos can be hived off to the private sector. In the case of the Arts Council, which last year received Pounds 225m of government money to distribute in support of the arts, the report is believed to have considered how efficiently it has served the 10 regional arts boards. Its grant is to be cut by Pounds 5m this year.</p>

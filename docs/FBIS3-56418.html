Yushenkov announced that on Sunday morning the bureau of the  Russia's Choice faction had held a meeting with Gaydar's  participation and unanimously supported Gaydar's decision, aware  that he could not bear the responsibility for the policy he does  not support.    Yushenkov said that Gaydar would concentrate on his  parliamentary activity and on the creation of a new party on the  basis of Russia's Choice.    To quote Yushenkov, Finance Minister Boris Fedorov is also  planning to quit the government. Like Gaydar, "he cannot bear  the responsibility for a policy which will inevitable spur  inflation".    Anatoliy Chubays will stay in the government, said  Yushenkov.    In the new situation, the parliamentary committee for the  budget, planning and taxes should be led by Russia's Choice  representative Aleksandr Pochinok, although earlier Russia's  Choice had not objected to this committee being led by Grigoriy  Yavlinskiy's nearest associate Mikhail Zadornov.</p>

Work Practices and Engineering Controls for Class I Asbestos Operations._Non-mandatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> This is a non-mandatory appendix to the asbestos standards for construction and for shipyards. It describes criteria and procedures for erecting and using negative pressure enclosures for Class I Asbestos Work, when NPEs are used as an allowable control method to comply with paragraph (g)(5)(i) of this section. Many small and variable details are involved in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> erection of a negative pressure enclosure. OSHA and most participants in the rulemaking agreed that only the major, more performance oriented criteria should be made mandatory. These criteria are set out in paragraph (g) of this section. In addition, this appendix includes these mandatory specifications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and procedures in its guidelines in order to make this appendix coherent and helpful. The mandatory nature of the criteria which appear in the regulatory text is not changed because they are included in this ``non-mandatory'' appendix. Similarly, the additional criteria and procedures included as guidelines in the appendix, do not become mandatory because mandatory criteria are also included in these comprehensive guidelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, none of the criteria, both mandatory and recommended, are meant to specify or imply the need for use of patented or licensed methods or equipment. Recommended specifications included in this attachment should not discourage the use of creative alternatives which can be shown to reliably  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achieve the objectives of negative-pressure enclosures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Requirements included in this appendix, cover general provisions to be followed in all asbestos jobs, provisions which must be followed for all Class I asbestos jobs, and provisions governing the construction and testing of negative pressure enclosures. The first category includes the requirement for use of wet methods, HEPA vacuums, and immediate bagging of waste; Class I work must conform to the following provisions:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;oversight by competent person  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;use of critical barriers over all openings to work area  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;isolation of HVAC systems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;use of impermeable dropcloths and coverage of all objects within regulated areas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, more specific requirements for NPEs include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;maintenance of ^0.02 inches water gauge within enclosure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;manometric measurements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;air movement away from employees performing removal work  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;smoke testing or equivalent for detection of leaks and air direction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;deactivation of electrical circuits, if not provided with ground-fault circuit interrupters. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=4 --> Planning the Project  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> The standard requires that an exposure assessment be conducted before the asbestos job is begun [&sect;1926.1101 (f)(1)]. Information needed for that assessment, includes data relating to prior similar jobs, as applied to the specific variables of the current job. The information needed to conduct the assessment will be useful in planning the project, and in complying with any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reporting requirements under this standard, when significant changes are being made to a control system listed in the standard, [see also those of USEPA (40 CFR 61, subpart M). Thus, although the standard does not explicitly require the preparation of a written asbestos removal plan, the usual constituents of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such a plan, i.e., a description of the enclosure, the equipment, and the procedures to be used throughout the project, must be determined before the enclosure can be erected. The following information should be included in the planning of the system:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=4 --> A physical description of the work area;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A description of the approximate amount of material to be removed;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A schedule for turning off and sealing existing ventilation systems;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Personnel hygiene procedures;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

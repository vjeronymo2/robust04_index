			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Udi Segal on news </F> conference with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin "held in Jerusalem  a short while ago" -- live]    [Excerpts] The prime minister seemed very disturbed by the  Hadera terror attack. [passage omitted] Prime Minister Rabin  said that this was yet another attack by fanatics trying to  sabotage the peace process. We, however, will stay the course  and continue implementing the peace process, thus foiling their  intentions to harm it.    Rabin spoke about the announcement by Hamas [Islamic  Resistance Movement], stating that after the Hebron massacre and  again today Hamas announced it will carry out five harsh  retaliatory attacks inside Israel's territory to revenge the  massacre. According to Hamas, it has carried out two of those  attacks: the grave attack last week in 'Afula and today's  serious attack in Hadera. Prime Minister Rabin said Hamas and  the Islamic Jihad decided to focus on their activity inside the  Green Line boundaries with a political aim of diverting Israeli  public opinion against the peace process.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by President Rafael Caldera and Colombian </F> President Cesar Gaviria Trujillo with domestic and foreign  reporters, moderated by Guillermo Alvarez Bajares, chief of the  Venezuelan Central Information Office, from the Ayacucho Room of  Miraflores Palace in Caracas--live relay]    [Text] [Alvarez] Let's begin with Mr. Luis Eduardo  Maldonado, representing Colombian radio stations.    [Maldonado] President Gaviria, you are about to complete  four  years in office. How are relations with Venezuela? Are they  better off, the same, or worse, and in what area?    [Gaviria] Before answering your questions, I want to  reiterate what I said this morning: The Colombian president's  happiness in coming here with all the Colombian cabinet members  -- an unprecedented action in Colombian politics -- to express  to President Caldera and all the Venezuelan people our  solidarity, and our willingness to continue working in the area  of integration, which has been so fruitful and positive.    During this special working session held today with  President  Caldera and all the members of his cabinet and Venezuelan  officials, we discussed all the areas which advanced during the  last few years. We discussed how close the relationship has  become and how much we have advanced in trade and in many other  aspects. We discussed how useful the mechanism of the  negotiation and integration commission has been. We also  established new goals and objectives. We reviewed progress in  many positive aspects and how new problems have appeared, some  of which are growing problems; but this is normal in a  relationship, one sharing a 2,200 km border, that has advanced  so much.    Our government's assessment of relations with Venezuela is  that the integration process has been very fruitful and  positive. We -- Colombia and Venezuela-- have the most  advanced commercial and integration process in the developing  world today. We must continue to further that process. We must  continue to resolve controversies and problems. We must resolve  together the problems we are facing and open new possibilities  for integration.    [Alvarez] Lucy Faustino, representing Venezuelan television  stations.    [Faustino] My question is addressed to the Colombian  president. One week ago you told an international news agency  the following, and I quote: We are always going to have  problems in relations with Venezuela. The important thing is to  deal with the problems patiently. In light of those words,  which can somehow be interpreted as an unrealistic definition of  the coexistence of binational relations, how can Venezuelans  interpret your words? Can we expect effective results from this  summit to overcome those problems you addressed? Can you  briefly summarize those problems you deem most important?    For Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera, I would like to  know  if you agree with your colleague's view, and do you term it  optimistic, pessimistic, or realistic?    [Gaviria] I think it is unrealistic to think we will only  advance in positive aspects. We have made significant progress  regarding trade over the past years, and we are reaching the $2  billion figure in trade. We have made significant progress  regarding investments, and it is public knowledge how Colombian  investments have increased in Venezuela and vice versa. We have  progressed in transportation, physical integration, and our open  skies policy.    The negotiation commissions have done a great job and have  advanced in designing proposals and solutions in the area of  basins, immigration, river navigation, and border delimitation.  In all these aspects, an important and interesting job has been  done, but, obviously, the border is a long one. Exchange brings  about new problems. The greater flow of people brings new  problems. The immigration issue remains unresolved, and it has  even been complicated furthered by kidnappings and car thefts.  One can even say certain problems -- drug-trafficking problems  -- have worsened. Regarding this, there is a new relationship  between the Armed Forces, particularly since 1988, which is  helping to resolve these problems.    We must be realistic. We have made significant progress, but  we still have problems that must be dealt with. We cannot rip  our clothes apart, nor can we cry out every time there is a  conflict, every time an incident occurs.    We all have to try and pay attention and resolve such  incidents, conflicts, and problems, within the framework of this  relationship. This is a relationship between sister nations,  nations that have found integration, nations that have found the  developing world's most advanced system of integration. By the  same token, we must realize that because of this, we will never  have a relationship free of conflicts or incidents. What we  have to do is face them constructively and positively, without  making a big deal out of every incident; that would be a mistake  of which our children and descendants would never forgive us.  They will never forgive us if we try to turn each small  incident into a conflict.    [Alvarez] So we do not create any bad habits. I believe that  later we should ask President Caldera to answer that same  question, when he answers another question. William Parra,  representing Colombian television.    [Parra] Colombia has stood out among the nations of the  world, because it has paid the highest price in the  anti-drug-trafficking fight; unfortunately, there is news  regarding Colombia's proud struggle. The Constitutional Court  has decided to legalize a specific drug dose for personal use.  What is the Colombian president's response to the  Constitutional Court's decision, especially in light of the  unanimous rejection expressed by Colombian sectors? There is  even a letter from the business associations stating that if  Colombia and the government want to hold a referendum to reject  the court's decision, they are willing to pay for all the  publicity. What is the Colombian president's response to this,  and what kind of image does this create abroad of the country's  anti-drug-trafficking struggle?    [Gaviria] I gave a full response to that before I left this  morning, but allow me to explain something quickly now. We will  abide by the Constitutional Court's decision, but we do not  agree with it. We do not agree because of the serious effects  it could have on Colombians' health. This can create violence.  We do not agree with the rationale behind the decision, which  says this is something concerning the development of one's  personality. We are highly concerned with this, and we must  wait for the ruling to be handed down. The decision was mad,  but the ruling has not been issued yet. We hope the Colombian  Congress will be able to issue a law establishing limits, which  is required for such a decision. I am referring to the limits  that should be established for consumption by children and  teenagers, consumption in schools and public places, preventing  drivers and pilots from using drugs, and all these other normal  restrictions any community must impose when taking such a step.    There should be clear provisions for people to be able to  appeal for and receive medical treatment for drug consumption.  I do not believe the Colombian community or society can in any  way accept drug consumption as something good or as something  against which it cannot fight. The president has also said that  in countries or in U.S. states where this decision has been  adopted, this has been a decision made by citizens or their  representatives. This should not be a judicial decision but,  rather, a decision of the Colombian parliament, the Colombian  Congress, preceded by a public discussion on the implications of  such a decision, such as health and family considerations; in  fact, I have mentioned the possibility of a referendum, for  which our Constitution provides.    [Alvarez] Miss Paola Badaraco, representing Venezuelan  newspapers.    [Badaraco] Good afternoon, Mr. President. Together with  the question asked by my colleague from your country, I would  like to know or advise you that in Venezuela, a judge from the  state of Tachira has just released 32 people implicated in the  laundering of drug money. Do not both of you, the two  presidents, fear that the struggle against drugs could founder  in light of such decisions by the judicial branch? Thank you.    [Gaviria] It would seem to be a question for... [pauses]  That  is news to me. Well, yes. What Colombia's Constitutional Court  decided in principle -- I say in principle, because only an  announcement on a decision has been made, not a ruling -- is to  eliminate sanctions or penalties for personal drug consumption.  They invalidated the provision stating that personal drug use  was a violation of Colombian legislation.    The president of Colombia's Constitutional Court clearly  said  that this does not mean that drug trafficking will now be legal.  The sanctions set forth in our codes for drug trafficking and  drug production remain unchanged. This only refers to the  elimination of penalties for personal drug use. As far as I  understand, the court invalidated the articles establishing  arrest for this type of violation.    This in no way weakens the struggle against the drug cartels  or drug traffickers. I am sure Colombian society would never  take such a step, much less at the international level.    [Alvarez] Maria Elizabeth Vargas, representing Colombian  press.    [Vargas] Good afternoon, Messrs. Presidents. How does the  recent devaluation of the bolivar affect bilateral agreements,  and what kinds of agreements were reached?    [Gaviria] I would say this is basically a question for the  Colombian president -- a question on how decisions adopted by  Venezuela regarding its currency can affect the agreements we  have signed. Today, for the first time, the economic cabinets  of both countries held their meetings, despite the fact that  they had a framework for solutions within the bilateral  integration agreements. They held the first meeting today and  reviewed the situation, and let us say they did so within the  terms of the agreements of the two countries with other regions  and with the G-3 [Group of Three], of the agreements with  Central America and the need to boost these accords, of the  agreements with the Caribbean, and also a review of the  macroeconomic situation. We are alert, and we are keeping  abreast of what is happening. Colombia, obviously, is not going  to make any decision.    Colombia hopes to assimilate the exchange rate decisions  made  by the Central Bank and the Venezuelan Government. We hope  these economic decisions adopted by President Caldera's  administration will in no way alter our integration process. We  do not plan to adopt any measure to affect that integration  process.    We trust in this process and have found Colombia's  participation in this process to be enriching. We hope to  contribute to help Venezuela overcome its recent economic  difficulties. For this, President Caldera, his government, and  the Venezuelan people can count on our full support.    [Alvarez] Representing international news agencies based in  Venezuela, Mr. Roberto Cienfuegos.    [Cienfuegos] Good afternoon, Messrs. Presidents.  Representatives of your governments and of Mexico are meeting  today in Santa Fe de Bogota to analyze the future of the G-3.  My question is this: When do you plan to culminate the free  trade agreement that you proposed? Also, excuse me, but this  question is being asked throughout the region: Will President  Gaviria, when he assumes his post in the OAS, commit his efforts  toward Cuba's total reintegration into this organization? Thank  you.    [Gaviria] I will respond regarding the G-3. The will of the  two economic groups of both countries -- the one expressed by  all members of the economic cabinets -- was clear-cut in wanting  to culminate the G-3 agreement soon and to proceed to sign it.    We all agree that the G-3 is very important and serves as  the focal point of economic integration with the Caribbean,  Central America, and a large portion of South America. Also, we  hope the few differences we still have can be resolved promptly.  Negotiations are taking place in Santa Fe de Bogota today, as  one journalist has already noted. We hope that the process can  be finalized.    Today, President Caldera and I are hoping -- and we have  already taken steps to place the telephone call -- to call  Mexican President Carlos Salinas to reaffirm our political  commitment and our wish to finalize the G-3. The ministers of  the two countries have made this recommendation to us, and we  have accepted it. As soon as this news conference is over,  President Caldera and I hope to talk to President Salinas.    As for Cuba, I would simply like to make a very broad  statement, because I cannot take action on this issue without  the mandate of the organization after I have assumed the post of  secretary general. I think all Latin Americans, without  exception, believe... [pauses] We want Cuba's reincorporation  into the inter-American system. Nevertheless, we also want  political and economic changes to take place in that country,  making this reintegration possible. All of us want democratic  progress in Cuba, as well as progress toward a market economy.  I think all of us in general agree on using diplomacy to  achieve these ends.    [Alvarez] Here is Raul Gutierrez, on behalf of  Colombia-based  international correspondents.    [Gutierrez] Mr. Caldera, the thorny issue in relations  between the two countries is the border dispute. Looking ahead  to when President Gaviria steps down, are you considering the  possibility of direct talks within an international court or the  termination of this border dispute?    [Caldera] Venezuela has been in favor of the idea of  dialogue. There is no reason to interrupt it. The talks held  between the commissions appointed a few years ago have explored  many paths toward resolving this dispute. Many steps have been  taken toward understanding and recognizing the importance and  significance of demarcation. We have agreed on the need for a  global approach. This is not the only country, not the only  problem, and should not be considered a thorn in anyone's side.    As President Gaviria has said, there naturally will be  problems between two countries with such a long-lived border --  countries that feature so many various interests. There will be  more problems in the future. Nevertheless, there are no  differences that cannot be resolved through dialogue, and there  is no dialogue that cannot lead to a solution, especially when  there is an awareness of the need and the willingness to become  integrated.    [Gaviria] I would briefly like to reiterate what I told the  negotiating commissions this morning. The Colombian Government  has complete confidence in the mechanisms on which Colombia and  Venezuela have agreed to resolve this and other problems between  the two countries. Here, I am talking about direct dialogue and  negotiations, as well as the negotiating commissions themselves  -- mechanisms that we regard as adequate for resolving not only  the border dispute, but also the problems of immigration and  river navigation, problems shared by the two governments.    The political forces of both countries have been represented  in this process of negotiations and talks. We believe these  mechanisms are proper and appropriate, and we also believe that  the overall approach has made it possible to make great progress  in the resolution of common problems and to take positive steps  in the economic, physical, and cultural integration of the two  countries.    [Alvarez] The final question of this news conference will  be asked by Mr. Jose Lugo, who is representing the Venezuelan  radio stations.    [Lugo] Good afternoon to both presidents. This question is  for Mr. Gaviria, and here I am departing a bit from the area of  bilateral relations.    Considering the support extended to you by the U.S.  Government in your bid to become the next OAS secretary general,  what position will you adopt, once you are in that post,  concerning the announcement of an intensification of the  blockade against Haiti and the possibility of a military  invasion of that Caribbean island?    [Gaviria] I have decided not to play the role of OAS  secretary general until after I am sworn in. I do not intend to  express any OAS-related views until I assume the position.  Currently, I am the president of Colombia, and I will not  express any views on any issue except as president of Colombia.  I will express those views at the appropriate forums, the OAS  and United Nations, if those topics are discussed there. As  president of Colombia, however, I believe that I speak for my  country when I say that all of us truly yearn to see the full  restoration of democracy in Haiti through the appropriate  mechanisms.    [Alvarez] Thank you, Messrs. Presidents, for your presence  at  this news conference, and thanks to all of the journalists of  Colombia and Venezuela.</p>

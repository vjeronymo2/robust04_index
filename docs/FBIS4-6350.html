			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Affairs Secretary Roberto Romulo yesterday  said that a "growing interest" in expanding links between the  Philippines and Myanmar (formerly Burma) should be explored by  encouraging an intensified exchange of private sector  representatives from both countries.    "There is an enormous potential still waiting to be tapped  in  this area," Mr. Romulo said during a meeting with officials of  the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC).    He pointed out private sector representatives are best  positioned to develop meaningful cooperation among themselves in  order to pave the way for more significant economic ties between  Manila and Rangoon.    "Let me add that in my position, I will do my best to  stimulate more trade and business contacts for the mutual  benefits of our two countries," he said.    Mr. Romulo told SLORC officials government is "encouraged by  the moves taken by Myanmar to work closely with ASEAN  (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) and individual ASEAN  (members), in the spirit of good neighborliness and friendship."    He likewise assured the Burmese government of Manila's  continued support for the one-Southeast Asia concept which will  include the six ASEAN states of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the  Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand plus Myanmar and the three  Indo-Chinese states of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos.    "You may be assured that in every forum, the Philippines has  always supported the concept of one Southeast Asia which will no  longer be divided by ideological boundaries of the Cold War, but  working together towards greater cooperation for the common  welfare of all the peoples of the Southeast Asian region," he  said.    He noted ASEAN at the moment is facing the "exciting  challenge" of enhancing regional cooperation among its members  and its dialogue partners.    "In this effort, we more than welcome the valuable  contributions that Myanmar can make in the interest of promoting  regional peace, progress and harmony. Let us join hands and  forge a more dynamic and progressive Southeast Asia," he said.</p>

			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Management: Controversy over Canada's loans policy Canada is searching for ways to breathe vigour into a popular federal loan-guarantee programme for budding entrepreneurs which makes use of the extensive resources of the country's financial institutions. Over CDollars 7.7bn has been disbursed to about 285,000 businesses since the inception of the Small Business Loans Act (SBLA) programme 30 years ago. In the year to March 1990, 13,800 loans were made with a value of CDollars 539m. (The British government, meanwhile, has commissioned a review of the UK's equivalent Loan Guarantee Scheme. This programme, which provides a 70 per cent guarantee, has backed 27,900 loans worth Pounds 890m since 1981.) The SBLA's greatest strength, but one which is also turning out to be a serious weakness, is the role of financial institutions in administering the scheme. The loans are advanced by banks, trust companies and credit unions - institutions that have branch networks and credit assessment skills which the government could not hope to match. Ottawa's role is to provide a guarantee on up to 85 per cent of the loan, with the financial institution taking the risk on the remaining 15 per cent. All loans must be secured, either by business or personal assets. The loans can be used to finance up to 90 per cent of land and premises costs, and 80 per cent of equipment costs, up to a CDollars 100,000 limit. Only companies with annual sales of less than CDollars 2m are eligible. Banks are obliged to charge an interest rate equal to one percentage point over bank prime rate, currently at 10 per cent in Canada. This compares with a typical rate for commercial loans of two or three points above prime. The scheme appears to have made a sizeable contribution in spawning new enterprises. Almost 40 per cent of the SBLA loans made last year were for start-ups, while 60 per cent were for businesses less than three years old. A study commissioned by the Canadian Bankers Association says that about 15 per cent of small-business loans are covered by an SBLA guarantee. But the volume of loans has slowed markedly in the past few years. Last year's total number of 13,800 was 22 per cent down on 1989. One reason is the recession. But the banks, more concerned than ever with their lending margins, also object to being forced to make loans at the set rate of prime plus 1 per cent. The banks have come to see SBLA loans as something of a loss leader; they consider the chief benefit to be the other business they may generate from the borrowing company, its owners or its employees. Michael Hanly, director of small business loans in the Department of Industry, Science and Technology, says that banks are increasingly taking loans onto their own books which might in the past have been channelled through the SBLA. 'We've got to make it more attractive for the banks,' he says. Among the changes now under consideration are a more flexible interest-rate structure (including perhaps, a service fee for the banks), and a higher loan ceiling. The 88,000-member Canadian Federation for Independent Business is pressing for other adjustments, too. It suggests that the guarantee and interest-rate formula could be tailored for specific groups of entrepreneurs, such as women or disadvantaged minority groups. In return for market-related interest charges, the CFIB wants the banks to cut back their personal security requirements. 'Our experience is that, even on conventional loans, the banks over-demand on collateral,' says Brian Gray, the CFIB's senior vice-president. The chances of the banks agreeing to that however, are small.</p>

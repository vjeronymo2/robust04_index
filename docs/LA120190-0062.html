			<p><P> December 1, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> LEGAL FLAWS CITED IN MURDER PROSECUTION  </P> <P> Citing procedural problems, a Ventura County Superior Court judge tentatively  decided Friday to dismiss the murder case against David Wayne Sconce, a  Pasadena crematory operator who was accused of poisoning a rival mortician with  oleander.  </P> <P> However, prosecutors have said that if the case is dismissed, they will refile  the charges.  </P> <P> Judge Frederick A. Jones said there were flaws in the arrangement that allowed  two Los Angeles County prosecutors to be special deputy district attorneys in  Ventura County in the 1985 death of Timothy Waters.  </P> <P> Jones said he will review attorneys' arguments further before finalizing his  decision next week.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Attys. Harvey Giss and James Rogan were overseen by the Los  Angeles County district attorney's office and not the Ventura County office as  they should have been by law, Jones said in his tentative ruling.  </P> <P> If Jones finalizes his decision, prosecutors would have to repeat much of the  lengthy, complex process required to bring Sconce to trial in Superior Court,  including Municipal Court arraignment, preliminary hearing and Superior Court  arraignment.  </P> <P> Prosecutors have alleged that Sconce, 34, spiked Waters' drink with a fatal  dose of oleander at a Ventura County restaurant to stop him from spreading word  about health code violations at the Sconce family's Lamb Funeral Home in  Pasadena.  </P> <P> If the case is dismissed, Giss has said he will see that the charges are  refiled against Sconce and that the proper procedures are followed so he can  prosecute the case.

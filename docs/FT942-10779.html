			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Shake-up at African bank urged: Consultants criticise 'chaotic' bureaucracy at development body Leading member countries of the African Development Bank say they are holding back the replenishment of the bank's soft-loan fund to demand fundamental changes in the way Africa's premier lending institution conducts its business. Bank governors say they are alarmed at the findings of a task force of external consultants who recommend a radical shake-up in the institution's lending policies, projects and personnel. Their report describes the bank, which receives money chiefly from leading western industrial countries, as a chaotic, top-heavy bureaucracy, weakened by the impoverishment of the continent it is meant to help, and riddled with political intrigue and suspicion. The report of the Task Force on Project Quality, chaired by Mr David Knox, a former vice-president of the World Bank, will dominate discussions at the bank's 30th annual general meeting in Nairobi this week. 'If not strengthened, (the bank) may end up by destroying itself. That is the stark choice before the entire bank community,' says the confidential report, a copy of which was obtained by the Financial Times. Ironically, the task force said it could not assess the quality of the Dollars 27.8bn (Pounds 19bn) the bank has approved in loans over the past 30 years 'due to the absence of reliable and sufficient data on completed and active projects'. The task force said it could not find a central file on any single project. The bank's financial health has begun to suffer from loan defaults and arrears, which have topped Dollars 700m, according to Mr Babacar Ndiaye, the bank's Senegalese president. 'The bank is being pulled in all directions,' says the report. 'Management mistrusts the board, and vice-versa.' Almost half of the bank's loans have been awarded to seven of the bank's 51 borrowing members: Nigeria, Morocco, Egypt, Tunisia, Algeria, Ivory Coast and Zaire. In private, governors say there is open war between Mr Ndiaye and some north African members of the 18-member executive board. The task force says the president 'has much authority but no power'. It says the problems associated with the bank's governance must be solved. The task force says bank personnel have been unable to keep up with the pace of growth in project lending. Little attention is paid to the quality of loans as opposed to quantity. The task force does not single out individuals or specific groups for blame. It does, urge African member countries, who own two-thirds of the bank, to take a more active interest in monitoring the bank's financial health. vie Thompson says. The relationship between Anglo and De Beers - cemented by substantial cross shareholdings - has worked well for years and there is no reason to suppose it will not go on doing so. De Beers concentrates on the diamond business. Anglo will continue to invest in diamonds through De Beers and continue to provide De Beers' technical needs - 'that way we can offer the people we hire much wider scope'. De Beers needs a very strong balance sheet to be able to finance the troughs in diamond demand or sudden increases in supply. So it will continue to build up investment in 'a portfolio of companies competently run, because De Beers' people need to put all their concentration on diamonds'. Cashflows will be used for businesses the group knows well. Anglo's profile might change slightly if South African exchange controls are removed and it can invest abroad. But as Minorco is cash-rich and unhampered by the restrictions, 'we are not champing at the bit for that to happen'. He suggests South Africa should work towards the removal of exchange controls but 'timing is everything. We cannot run the risk of capital being withdrawn in a hurry.' The staying power of the group is well illustrated by De Beers' Central Selling Organisation which yesterday welcomed clients from all over the world for a 60th anniversary party. After last year's record performance - CSO sales reached Dollars 4.4bn (Pounds 3bn), some 5 per cent ahead of the previous record in 1988 - the diamond market 'opened firm' this year, says Mr Ogilvie Thompson. Nevertheless, De Beers faces some substantial challenges. It is still restricting the quantities of stones it takes from producers who belong to the cartel - only 85 per cent of those contracted for. This is a clear sign that supply continues to outpace demand. And stocks are already high - De Beers' own have a book value of about Dollars 4bn and probably have a much higher market value. But the biggest threat to the cartel is Russia, which supplies about 25 per cent of the world's gem diamonds by value, and whose contract with the CSO runs out next year. Mr Ogilvie Thompson has already scolded the Russians for selling diamonds from their stocks 'in contravention of our agreements'. He says most of those officials in Russia who have been in the diamond business for years want to stay with the CSO. Others, such as Mr Yevgeny Bychkov, head of Komdragmet, the Russian diamond and precious stones committee, 'are not totally committed. We have 18 months to convince them that it is in their best interests.' Leaders gather to see Mandela sworn in, Page 2 Yemenis drive on Aden, Page 3</p>

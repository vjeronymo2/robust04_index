More than 6.7 million crimes were  registered. Thus, the number of crimes rose by 7.1 percent, or  almost 450,000, compared with 1992. This was announced  yesterday by Hermann Lutz, chairman of the police trade union,  in Hilden, North Rhine-Westphalia.    Lutz said that the high rate increases in eastern Germany  are  "alarming." In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, 40 percent more  crimes were registered than the previous year, in Brandenburg  34.1 percent, in Thuringia 33 percent, in Saxony-Anhalt 23.2  percent, and in Saxony 11.2 percent. Lutz said that these  growth rates are partly due to the fact that during the years  after the integration, not all crimes were registered.    The strong increase in crime in western Germany has been  reduced. While a growth of 9.2 percent was registered in 1992,  it was only 2.7 percent last year. However, the increase in  homicide and manslaughter -- 17 percent -- and in economic crime  -- almost 40 percent -- was above average.    Last year, police were not even able to resolve one out of  two crimes. The level was only 40 percent. However, 90 percent  of all cases of homicide and manslaughter were solved. Lutz:  "If we could work everywhere as we are working in the homicide  squads, we could have all criminal activity under control."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Leader of the Bosnian Serbs  Radovan Karadzic in turn has highly approved the Russian foreign  policy especially during the Sarajevo ultimatum.    Today Karadzic arrived in Moscow to receive the Sholokhov  literature prize. During his visit Karadzic intends to meet  Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev also but in the words of the  leader of the Bosnian Serbs himself he will not raise the  question of Russia recognizing the Serbian Republic.    At the same time Karadzic voiced the wish that Russian  diplomats in the Balkans should be more understanding towards  the problems of the Bosnian Serbs. Karadzic also called for  expansion of the Russian peacemaking contingent in Bosnia and  Herzegovina.    [Begin Karadzic recording -- in Russian] We think this would  be a necessary expansion because they would be more objective  than soldiers from Muslim sides [storony]. We did not resist  when soldiers from Muslim sides came but we think there could be  big problems if the UN decides to leave and then soldiers from  the Muslim sides might stay and then the balance would be upset.  [end recording]    Commenting on the decision of the U.S. Congress to lift the  embargo on arms supplies to Bosnia, Karadzic said in his  interview to Radio Moscow Echo: [Begin Karadzic recording] It  has to be said that there is no embargo because the Muslims are  getting arms every day and sometimes I think it might be in our  interests if the Americans lifted the embargo and sanctions on  the Muslims and then Russia and the Ukraine and other states  around Serbia which have difficulties with the sanctions might  lift the sanctions against Serbia.

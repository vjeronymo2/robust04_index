			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ETHNIC EATING: ETHIOPIAN KESTE DEMENA: IT'S AN ADVENTURE IN SPICINESS  </P> <P> Eating Ethiopian style is a great ice breaker. Who can remain aloof while  reaching into a communal platter and picking up food with your fingers? Pulling  meat off the bones and dealing with soft, moist vegetable and lentil dishes in  this fashion may be messy, but it's fun.  </P> <P> What alleviates the mess is injera, a thin, spongy, fermented bread that is as  soft as a handkerchief. Platters of food are lined with injera and more is  served on the side. The technique is to tear off pieces and use them as scoops  for the food. Made with wheat flour and with flour ground from a grain called  teff, injera has a faint sour flavor.  </P> <P> At Keste Demena (the name means rainbow), the Ethiopian food is fine and spicy.  But more than anything, I'm intrigued by the way this Venice Boulevard  restaurant serves coffee. The beans are roasted to order, and the rich, dark  brew comes in a handleless earthen pot set on a brightly colored straw ring.  You drink from tiny cups, like those used for Chinese tea. And while sipping,  you inhale the sweet, strong perfume of incense. (Tiny incense pellets sit atop  coals in a tall, golden container that is placed on the table alongside the  coffee implements.) It's an enchanting ritual.  </P> <P> But if sipping coffee here is a soothing experience, eating here can be a spicy  adventure. Even the salad dressing tastes hot. At one meal, there were three of  us, and we ordered only two dishes. That was plenty because salad, spiced red  lentils and lots of injera were included in the dinner. One dish was doro wot,  chicken with onion and hot pepper, simmered with spiced butter. Those are mild  terms for a very aggressively seasoned bird. The other was yessiga tibbs, a  sort of Ethiopian pepper beef.  </P> <P> Recurring themes here are raw meat and the taste of butter. Kitfo, a dish of  beef top-round cut into tiny cubes, combines both. Those who object to the raw  kitfo that Ethiopians prefer can have it cooked. My group tried both ways and  loved the taste of the raw meat inundated with butter and spices. The butter,  by the way, is made by boiling unsalted domestic butter and adding imported  Ethiopian butter and spices.  </P> <P> Those alarmed by the liberal use of this ingredient in the meats can try Keste  Demena's "no-cholesterol plate." This is put together from a list of vegetarian  dishes, some of which are mustard greens; a combination of green beans, potato,  cabbage and carrots; red lentils and a fine lentil salad that is crunchy with  shallots and raw chiles.  </P> <P> The meats served here are chicken, beef and lamb -- no pork. Fish is available  during Lent, although it is not on the menu. Yebeg wot is the well-seasoned and  really great tasting lamb. Another lamb dish, yebeg alicha, contains fresh  ginger, garlic, turmeric and spiced butter, but the sauce is mild. There is  also a chicken version.  </P> <P> Zigni is a zesty beef stew, and minchetabish is wonderfully seasoned beef that  is ground as fine as coarse sand. I'd love to put some of it in a taco. I  didn't do so well with tere sega, a bowlful of thick blocks of raw beef that  was . . . well, too much rawness for me. But I did like the dipping sauce, a  thin, red mixture called awaze.  </P> <P> The restaurant serves Ethiopian breakfast until noon. And the menu includes a  few pasta dishes, a reminder of the years when the country was occupied by  Italy. The beverages are non-alcoholic except for a mild, home-fermented honey  wine called tej. It's as yellow as fruit juice and has a nice dry tang.  </P> <P>  Keste Demena Ethiopian Restaurant, 5779 W. Venice Blvd., Los Angeles. (213)  933-6522. Open Thursday through Tuesday, 11 a.m.-11 p.m. Major credit cards  accepted. Reservations advised on weekends. Dinner for two, food only, $14-$30.  </P></p>

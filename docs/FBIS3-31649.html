			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague Feb 22 (CTK) -- Czech Defence Minister  Antonin Baudys said today he was convinced of the correctness of  his initiative to solve the Bosnian conflict, adding that it was  his private initiative which did have to be discussed  beforehand. [sentence as received]    Speaking after his meeting with Foreign Minister Josef  Zieleniec tonight, he admitted that the way in which he made  public the initiative was not only non-standard, but probably  inappropriate from the diplomatic point of view.    Baudys acquainted journalists on Saturday [19 February] with  his proposal to end the Bosnian conflict, admitting that he had  consulted neither the government nor parliament.    Under the proposal, the conflict would be solved mainly by a  good will committee, which would be entrusted by the UN to  supervise the situation. The committee would comprise several  states connected by religion with the Bosnian warring parties,  for instance, Russia, Greece, Pakistan, Turkey, France and Italy.    To defend his course of action, he said today it was due to  the pressure of developments because as late as Sunday night, no  one knew whether or not Sarajevo would be bombarded.    Baudys pointed out that Czech UNPROFOR [UN Protection  Forces]  soldiers were stationed in Serbian Krajina and that, aware of  his responsibility for their lives, "I did what I did."    "I agree that the way I did it was not probably appropriate  and correct. Nevertheless, I believe that I have neither  breached the constitution nor exceeded my powers," Baudys said.    He said that he and Zieleniec discussed mainly the technique  of making public the proposal and that they discussed the  contents only superficially.    Baudys said they also turned to their Friday discussion  during a luncheon, when Baudys informed Zieleniec of his  initiative. But he admitted that his statement at the press  conference on Saturday could be misunderstood as if Zieleniec  were informed not only of the proposal, but also of the way in  which it was being made public.    Baudys said he told Zieleniec on Friday that he had sent off  the letters containing his proposal to settle the situation in  Bosnia and Herzegovina, but did not tell him that he had sent  them via embassies and two military air attaches. "He probably  reached the impression that I had sent them via regular mail,"  Baudys admitted.    He said he believed that the factual contents of his  proposal  should be distinguished from the way in which it was made public  and which will probably be the subject of further discussion.</p>

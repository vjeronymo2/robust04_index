			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava, March 22 (CTK) -- "We expected this  given the wave of emotions," Chairman of the coalition  Democratic Left Party (SDL) Peter Weiss commented on the  increased popularity of former Premier Vladimir Meciar today.    Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) rating  increased from 18 to about 26 per cent after the fall of his  government in mid-March. The SDL, for its part, would be  supported by only 10 per cent of Slovaks.    "We must convince citizens that it is possible to rule  without threats, scandals and creating the image of an enemy,  and by means of cooperation and reasonable compromises. I am  not pessimistic at all," said Weiss.    Moreover, the government has prepared some pragmatic steps,  including launching the second wave of coupon privatization  shortly before elections, he added. The elections are slated  for September 31-October 1.    "Even a citizen who does not have enough money to  participate  in privatization, should be given a chance," stressed Weiss,  specifying that the coupon method (most important privatization  method in the Czech Republic), virtually abandoned in Slovakia  in 1992, will be just one of several ways of privatization.    "Meciar is expected to receive some 22 to 25 percent (in the  elections). But it is too little to form a government and I do  not know anyone willing to create a coalition with him," Milan  Knazko, chairman of the governing Alliance of Slovak Democrats  (AD SR), said.</p>

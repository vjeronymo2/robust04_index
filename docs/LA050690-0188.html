			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOT SPENDING MONEY CAN IMPROVE FAST FOOD  </P> <P> In "Diet for a New America," author John Robbins points out that fast-food  hamburger chains are the principal offenders in the rape of the rain forests. A  football field of atmosphere-nourishing trees are razed daily, primarily to  provide pasture land for beef (despite clown-faced Ronald McDonald's  reassurance that hamburgers grow in hamburger patches).  </P> <P> Robbins, who points out that any ecological turnabout must begin on our own  plates, suggests that every American who forgoes one quarter-pounder per week  effectively saves an acre of rain forest per year.  </P> <P> JOHN OETTINGER  </P> <P> Hollywood  </P></p>

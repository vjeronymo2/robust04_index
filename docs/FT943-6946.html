			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Kuchma appoints advisers Mr Leonid Kuchma, Ukraine's new president, yesterday rounded out his circle of advisers by naming a new foreign minister. Mr Gennadi Udovenko, whose appointment awaits parliamentary approval, was Ukraine's permanent representative to the UN while Ukraine was still part of the Soviet Union, and has been Ukraine's ambassador to Poland since 1991. This week Poland and Ukraine announced efforts to promote trade by improving transit links between Odessa on the Black Sea and Gdansk on the Baltic sea. With parliament in recess, in the last two weeks Mr Kuchma has also appointed Mr Yuri Yahenrov to run Ukraine's faltering privatisation programme and Mr Serhei Osyka as minister of foreign economic relations. These appointments have been welcomed by Kiev's business community.</p>

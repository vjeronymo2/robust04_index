			<p><P> March 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A GLOBAL OUTLOOK;  </P> <P> FASHION: JAPANESE DESIGNERS MAKE A SPLASH IN PARIS. BUT IT'S THE FRENCH WHO  IMPRESS WITH AN EASTERN EUROPE INFLUENCE.  </P> <P> The Japanese presence at the fall ready-to-wear collections has never been more  apparent. But the clothes making the strongest impression are by French  designers who relate fashion to current events in Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> Japanese-born Rei Kawakubo for Comme des Garcons was among the first big names  to show.  </P> <P> The disheveled look ruled her runway on Thursday. Clothes appeared to be put on  wrong, so that extra necklines dangled from the bodice or the waistline of day  wear cut from a fabric that resembled cotton mattress padding, and evening wear  in pastel velvet.  </P> <P> The look conveyed an ineptitude that was humorous but unsettling. After all,  these clothes are meant for grown women.  </P> <P> At Yohji Yamamoto Show, circus music set the tone for tuxedo jackets with tails  in front, not in back, and art-to-wear evening dresses that looked like a  child's collage made from paper grocery bags.  </P> <P> After a number of such eccentricities came down the runway, a classic  Western-tailored pants suit sparked a burst of applause from the audience.  </P> <P> That said a lot about what hits and what misses the mark this season. Anything  too contrived, too consciously arty, looks wrong.  </P> <P> Issey Miyake's work always straddles the line between fashion and art. This  time art won. Most of the clothes were too sculptural, not wearable enough.  What did work were his long evening dresses with lantern-shaped pleats and  soft, folded origami-like collars. What absolutely did not work were his  stretchy unitards with cone-shaped padding.  </P> <P> Hanae Mori, who has maintained her business in Tokyo and Paris for three  decades, hosted an exhibit of 35 years of her work, held Thursday evening, in  the Pavillon des Arts, near the Contemporary Art Museum, Centre Pompidou.  </P> <P> In the beginning, she was a definite minority among Paris-based Japanese  designers. But not anymore. This season close to a dozen Japanese will show  their collections here before they take them to Tokyo to exhibit in May. Most  designers in the group have boutiques in both cities.  </P> <P> Thierry Mugler was the first to show a collection with an Eastern European  flavor. It was all about Berlin before the war. Body-gripping stretch pants;  strapless, lattice-back tops; torso-molded jackets, most of them in black,  recalled Berlin cabarets and Berthol Brecht, as well as Barbarella, the Jane  Fonda movie character.  </P> <P> In the showroom after the event, the clothes looked comparatively tame -- but  still not exactly standard fare. The curves turned out to be built into the  Space-Age fabrics with enough body of their own to stand up like furniture.  </P> <P> Jean Paul Gaultier continued the Eastern Europe idea on Friday night with one  of the most creative collections of this season. His refugee ensembles recalled  history book accounts of Poles, Russians and Czechs fleeing home and Adolf  Hitler, taking only what they could carry.  </P> <P> Included were marabou-feather boas wrapped around man-tailored, tweed pants  suits. There were ski sweaters and ski boots layered under sequined evening  sheaths, and Fair Isle unitards topped by satin boleros.  </P> <P> These clothes told far more than just fashion stories about fabric mixes or  day-into-evening dressing. They spoke about a moment in history that Gaultier  obviously finds moving.  </P> <P> His intelligence, tempered by his obvious sensitivity to the subject, gave this  show the feeling of a tribute.  </P> <P> And for all their eccentric, eclectic appearance on the runway, the clothes  were classics. The gabardine and wool tweed pants suits in particular were  exceptional.  </P> <P> Karl Lagerfeld was among those whose inspiration came from closer to home. He  showed feminine, modern-minded clothes but made them look like the latest from  the streets of Paris.  </P> <P> Jackets in warm shades of red, blue and violet, as well as black, seemed  inspired by 18th-Century men's wear. Many were almost knee-length, nipped at  the waist, flared at the hem, with touches of black velvet at the collar or  cuff. He showed them over very short pleated skirts or leggings for a lively  but still elegant effect.  </P> <P> As if to disguise their virtues, the clothes were accessorized with some  too-hip, too-aggressive details: Cuffed, over-the-knee boots the models stomped  around in; extra-bold scale silver brooches and bangles, and black or blond  jaw-length wigs, teased into a snarl.  </P> <P> Claude Montana dedicated his show Saturday to Sgt. Pepper of Beatle's fame and  pop artist Andy Warhol -- two icons from the 1960s. Defining this collection  were tent dresses with bell-shaped sleeves; stretch pants; full, short coats,  and acid color combinations, such as violet with lime. Almost every outfit  began with stretch pants. Most often they were topped by knee-length coats.  Patent leather collars looked especially new, and at the same time, very '60s.  It was a good collection.  </P></p>

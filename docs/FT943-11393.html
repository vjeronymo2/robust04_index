			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Programme changed so that young people have appropriate training Sir, I write in response to your article 'Training cuts 'cause destitution' ' (July 22). In the interests of providing a balanced view, I would make the following points. Funding for the joint venture, known as Job, between the Children's Society and the Greater Nottingham Training and Enterprise Council was ended because a detailed audit by the GNTEC revealed that the young people were not receiving the training and guidance needed to achieve their full potential. As a result the trainees were transferred on to integrated programmes where it was felt they would receive improved quality training. The important point here is that they were transferred to training companies with both the experience and expertise to work with people with additional needs and achieve positive outcomes from their training. Each trainee is offered access to qualified professionals who guide, counsel and monitor all aspects of their development. In our view, the combination of an integrated environment backed by professional counselling gives young people with additional needs the best possible preparation to successfully enter the world of work. A number of trainees from the original scheme have subsequently achieved qualifications and jobs. One of the many obligations that Tecs have is for the health and safety of trainees, and this aspect was taken into consideration in arriving at our decision. The GNTEC was recently commended by the National Council for Voluntary Services for its work with additional needs groups.

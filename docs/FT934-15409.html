			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Observer: Memory lane France's Madame Thatcher is not to be outdone. Her disastrous 10 1/2 months in office may provide rather less fodder for the historians than Thatcher's 11-year reign, but that has not stopped the publication of a biography of former socialist prime minister Edith Cresson, attempting to explain her downfall in terms of an evil male-inspired conspiracy. In Edith Cresson, la femme piegee, (the trapped woman), Nouvel Observateur journalist Elisabeth Schemla lays into the likes of Stephane Collaro from the French version of Spitting Image. In the so-called Bebete Show, Cresson, whose puppet acted a brainless upmarket tart, was dubbed 'as useless as a suitcase without a handle'. Collaro is unrepentant, pointing to the damage she brought upon herself by ill-guarded remarks, such as asserting that a quarter of British men were homosexual. Jacques Juillard, deputy director of the Nouvel Observateur, who called her the dame de fer blanc (tin plate lady) says she failed to understand the rules of the game, one of which is that the French want political figures they can respect. Such as health minister Simone Veil, whose maternal demeanour keeps her well above such spats between the genders?</p>

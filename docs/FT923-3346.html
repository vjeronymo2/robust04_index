			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Panic shuffles his cabinet to weaken Milosevic MR Milan Panic, Yugoslavia's prime minister, yesterday appointed five new cabinet ministers in an effort to strengthen the federal government at the expense of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. Mr Ilija Djukic, the ambassador to China, was appointed foreign minister, replacing Mr Vladislav Jovanovic, who on Thursday resigned after accusing Mr Panic of betraying Serbian interests. Mr Jovanovic was seen to be carrying out Mr Milosevic's instructions. The other appointments included the posts of finance, agricultural and transport ministers. The sackings were the latest in a series of moves by Mr Left: Sarajevo residents queue for water yesterday in an area of the Bosnian capital hit hard by the continuing fighting Panic to weaken Mr Milosevic's power base. The Belgrade-born California businessman has so far wrested control of the federal army and the Interior Ministry from the Serbian president. Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, co-chairmen of a Yugoslav peace conference, yesterday met Mr Dobrica Cosic, president of the unrecognised Yugoslavia, which now comprises only Serbia and Montenegro, and Mr Panic. They later met top military officials and Mr Milosevic, who is seen by the international community as the chief instigator of carnage in Bosnia-Hercegovina. After the meeting, Mr Milosevic said he was optimistic of a quick end to the bloodshed. 'It is important that the (Geneva peace) conference has assumed a very objective course. . .leading us to hope that the crisis will be solved much faster than we had anticipated,' he said. 'The time for war has long since passed and the time for coming together' of the warring factions has arrived, Lord Owen told reporters. 'I believe Mr Milosevic is a very crucial person in that kind of future,' he added. Mr Panic reiterated his intention to halt the bloodshed in Bosnia as soon as possible. Reuter reports from Rome: The commander of Nato forces in Europe said yesterday peace would return to Bosnia only through a political settlement and criticised those campaigning for military action. General John Shalikashvili, an American, said in Taranto: 'We will not advance the cause of peace if we continue to insist on a military solution to the fighting in Bosnia-Hercegovina.'</p>

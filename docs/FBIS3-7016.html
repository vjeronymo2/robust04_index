			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] As can be seen in the Shinseito [Japan Renewal  Party] proposal to merge parliamentary groups with the Japan New  Party [JNP], some coalition parties are moving positively toward  the second stage of political party realignment. Komeito, which  has led the moves together with Shinseito, has recently been  quiet on the issue. Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa is  gradually shifting his emphasis to partnership with the JNP,  while maintaining friendly ties with Komeito. Other coalition  parties are keeping their distance from Komeito. As a result  Komeito members are becoming anxious about their party's  isolation in the coalition government.    Executives of Shinseito, JNP, and the Democratic Socialist  Party [DSP] met on the evening of 17 March and reconfirmed their  accord to form a "new party." Komeito, however, did not join  the meeting. This looked somewhat odd because Komeito had been  the most enthusiastic about "new party" proposal.    After the dispute over Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's  introduction of a public welfare tax, the Soka Gakkai, a  Buddhist group which serves as Komeito's primary sponsor,  reportedly expressed concern that an alliance between Ozawa and  Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa gave the public a  strong impression of collusion on the issue. Komeito members  also complained that the "Shinseito-Komeito" initiative was an  attempt to reshuffle the cabinet.    It seems Ichikawa is doing his best not to advertise his  links with Ozawa for the time being. Komeito will probably  watch merger talks between Shinseito and the JNP, and decide on  its response depending on how the issue develops.    Toshio Yamaguchi, an independent lower house member who left  the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], recently met Ichikawa to  urge that he have positive exchanges with other parties.    Ichikawa reportedly replied: "If I take action right now,  people will again criticize the Ozawa-Ichikawa link."</p>

			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Arts: 'Ali' - more Islam than ring craft / Theatre Ali, Geoffrey C. Ewing's one-man show which re-opens the Mermaid Theatre at Blackfriars, is described as a tribute to the former heavyweight boxing champion of the world. And there's the rub. Not only has this Ali a pretty face; his soul could hardly be bettered, too. He is your very Islamic Saint. The set says it all. Ali, long retired, is talking to his people - the poor and the disadvantaged - in 'an underfunded recreation room in a neighbourhood cultural centre in Detroit' in 1989. He begins slow and hesitant. He is suffering from Parkinson's Syndrome, although Ewing suggests that Ali uses his illness to protect himself from pestering questions. Gradually as he responds to the audience his current disability is shaken off, and he returns to his youth and his prime, to his joy at winning an Olympic Gold Medal in Rome for the US and his disillusionment with his treatment back home as a black. The formula is predictable but workmanlike. The problem is that none of the interesting bits of Ali's life are allowed to come between the man and his legend. There is not a critical word in the piece. His relationships with women might be considered to be, well, rather sexist, but here the wives are blamed for not becoming enthusiastic Moslems. The arrogance, the political naivity, the money making, above all the fascinating question of how much his illness can be attributed to blows in the ring, are ignored, as are his relationships with his nine children and his upbringing. The consolation is that Ewing makes a sympathetic Ali. The physical resemblance is close enough, especially when he strips down to 'float like a butterfly, sting like a bee'. A ring dominates the set, and the piece takes off when the fights are re-created, especially the 'rumble in the jungle' with Foreman and the 'thrilla in Manila' with Frazier. But director Stephen Henderson's only dramatic effect comes in the fight with Holmes when Ali's nemesis as a boxer is conveyed through flashing lights and klaxons. Ewing seems much more interested in Ali's commitment to Islam than in his ring-craft. Ali was undoubtedly terribly victimised by the government for his refusal to follow Presley into the Army for religious reasons, and this becomes the dramatic finale of the first half. But as the second half opens Ewing dodges this issue. 'Why ain't I in gaol? Because I've got money.' Ali was a great success off-Broadway and will appeal to the Ali fan club. Boxing fans could be disappointed in the lack of real meat. Equally disappointed will be those who wanted the inside track on one of the most fascinating characters in 20th century entertainment.

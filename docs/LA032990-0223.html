			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> AMERICANS MADE MORE, SAVED MORE IN FEB. THAN IN JAN.  </P> <P> Americans made more money in February than in January and socked away a greater  portion of it in savings, the Commerce Department said today.  </P> <P> Personal incomes climbed 0.9% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate  of $4.64 trillion -- the biggest monthly rise in nearly a year since a 1% gain  in March last year.  </P> <P> But the rate of increase in personal consumption spending last month slowed  sharply to 0.4% for a total seasonally adjusted annual rate of $3.63 trillion.  That followed a 1.0% increase in spending in each of January and February.  </P> <P> The higher earnings and more conservative spending pushed up the U.S. savings  rate to 5.7% from 5.3% in January.  </P> <P> Personal spending is the main engine of economic growth in the United States,  accounting for about two-thirds of demand for total goods and services output,  or GNP.  </P> <P> The department reported Wednesday that GNP growth in the final three months was  at a relatively weak annual rate of 1.1%, the poorest quarterly performance in  more than three years.  </P> <P> Personal savings went up to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $225 billion  in February from $206 billion in January.  </P> <P> While economic policy-makers have deplored Americans' low savings rates in  comparison with those of the rest of the world, the Bush Administration has  simultaneously expressed concern that high interest rates might curb spending  and slow expansion.  </P> <P> The Treasury Department is reportedly urging the Federal Reserve Board -- the  central bank that manipulates credit availability through its control of money  supply policy -- not to keep interest rates so high that they will discourage  borrowing and investment.  </P></p>

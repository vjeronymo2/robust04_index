			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Letter: Priorities for the environment Sir, Re your call for clearly stated priorities in environmental policy I would add that clear analysis is essential to establishing such priorities. In this vein, you cannot both state that global warming is 'the most important single global risk' and recommend that governments 'cast a sceptical eye over our renewable energy'. Energy production and use is the principal source of greenhouse gas emissions, and abatement policies necessarily imply the adoption of fossil fuel alternatives. Second, it is not fair to say recycling has 'become a moral crusade for the green movement' when, in fact, major environmental campaigns call first for waste minimisation, and promote recycling as a last resort. Industry has had a much bigger role in inflating the virtues of recycling, finding it a more convenient response to 'green pressures' than fundamental reform of activities to reduce natural resource utilisation per se.

			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NAMIBIA: RECONCILIATION AHEAD  </P> <P> Africa's last colony is moving toward independence on a promise of  reconciliation after an election that was impressive both in its turnout and in  its orderliness. The events are a credit to the United Nations, which  persevered in its efforts to free the territory in the face of decades of  resistance and opposition from South Africa.  </P> <P> The election result itself will reinforce the commitment to reconciliation. The  South-West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), which led the struggle for  independence and the guerrilla war that challenged South Africa's control, won  57% of the votes for a constituent assembly that now must draft a national  constitution. That margin assures SWAPO a strong but not controlling voice. A  two-thirds vote in the assembly is required under the U.N. plan for  independence, thus requiring cooperation among the parties. The restraint on  SWAPO will be the more welcome following reports of brutal repression of  dissidents in its own ranks during the liberation struggle.  </P> <P> SWAPO leader Sam Nujoma, who almost certainly will be Namibia's first  president, struck a conciliatory tone following the election. "There are no  losers," he said. "We are all winners." And, seeking to reassure minority  groups, he said, "We have no intentions of imposing our views on anyone."  </P> <P> As the election proceeded, SWAPO had modified its once radical platform,  abandoning proposals for broad nationalization of the private sector. Nujoma's  commitment will be promptly tested as the constituent assembly convenes and  seeks early agreement on a constitution so that independence can be completed  early in 1990. United Nations peacekeepers, who supervised the election and  certified its results as free and fair, will remain until independence day. So  they should.  </P> <P> The United States and many Western European nations have promised assistance.  It will be needed. South Africa is leaving the territory with a significant  deficit.  </P></p>

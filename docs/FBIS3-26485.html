In his speech, Wu Zhenhan pointed out: The province's  justice administration work has scored noticeable results over  the past year, which are proven by the following facts: With or  without lawsuits, the province's lawyers have helped their  clients successfully obtain compensation amounting to more than  1 billion yuan. Mediatory organs at all levels across the  province have successfully mediated more than 0.4 million cases  of civil dispute. The province's total number of suicide cases  and total number of criminal cases resulting from civil disputes  have each dropped by 6 percent over the previous year.    Provincial party committee Secretary Wang Maolin and Wu  Xiangdong, provincial party committee standing committee member  and political and legal affairs committee secretary, delivered  speeches at yesterday's closing session speeches, calling for  conscientiously implementing to the letter the principle of  "reform first, production second" in reform-through-labor and  reeducation-through-labor work and successfully carrying out  both reform and production on the premise of instituting the  people's democratic dictatorship.    Comrades Wang Maolin and Wu Xiangdong urged party committees  and governments at all levels in the province to earnestly  strengthen leadership over justice administration departments  and build a competent contingent of justice administration  officials, police officers, and policemen. They put forth a  number of specific requirements to this end.    A total of eight advanced units and 42 advanced individuals  recommended by the State Ministry of Justice and the Hunan  Provincial Justice Department respectively were commended at the  meeting.    Liu Fusheng, provincial people's congress standing committee  chairman; Zhu Dongyang, provincial people's congress standing  committee vice chairman; and provincial vice Governor Zhou  Shichang also attended yesterday's closing session.</p>

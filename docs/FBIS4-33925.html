			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Excerpts" of "exclusive interview" with General Humberto </F> Ortega, commander in chief of the Sandinist People's Army, by  Luis Arturo Alvarez; place and date not given]    [Text] [Alvarez] Following the special congress held last  week, there are rumors of division within the FSLN [Sandinist  National Liberation Front]. In your opinion, what were the  results of the congress?    [Ortega] Considering that the FSLN is the nation's largest  party, I believe the greatest result was that the congress ended  without the party being divided. Nevertheless, Sandinism has  not completely escaped the great political, economic, and social  polarization effecting all social strata of the nation.    [Alvarez] Many say that Sandinism still has not managed to  find its identity. It seems unable to adapt to its role as an  opposition party and does not find a definite ideological  course. Where is the FSLN really headed?    [Ortega] The FSLN, as well as all parties in Nicaragua, must  face the future to adjust to current world demands, which means  analyzing reality by casting aside all those rigid ideological  schemes and orthodox leanings.    [Alvarez] But is not just the opposite happening through a  strong orthodox hegemony following the last Sandinist Congress?    [Ortega] I know Sandinism very well, and I can tell you that  both opposing currents have among their membership  representatives from both trends. Neither side is very rigid or  defined.    In this sense there are more or less two orthodox points of  view, but what is most important is not that heretics should  become Christians or that Christians become heretics. It is  important that both heretics and Christians agree with what is  best for the country.    [Alvarez] To what degree will the Sandinist electoral future  be affected, especially in light of the 1996 elections, taking  into account its growing polarization?    [Ortega] To my way of thinking, the problem is not winning  the 1996 elections. Why does a party want to win the elections  if it is going to rule amid greater poverty, more disaster, and  if there is no true way out and no true consensus? This country  is going to be ungovernable. What is truly needed is that  whoever wins should structure a government of true national  unity.    [Alvarez] What role will you play within the FSLN once you  leave the Army next year?    [Alvarez] No, I will not rejoin the FSLN. I believe I  already played an historic role in the party. I am now playing  another historic role as the head of a handful of revolutionary  men like myself. We are giving Nicaragua an Army totally  unconnected with the FSLN or any other political force.    I will dedicate myself to a very special activity by  contributing to bring Nicaraguans closer through my experience,  my point of view, and the degree of authority I have. I will  not return to the FSLN, but I will always be a Sandinist. I  have been making a concerted effort with Pablo Antonio Cuadra,  an outstanding conservative intellectual, and with Cardinal  Miguel Obando y Bravo. For six months, we have been working  together to seek concrete solutions to specific problems.    [Alvarez] If representatives from various groups reach a  consensus on this project to seek national conciliation, would  you be willing to lead a new political group?    [Ortega] The core of the matter is that the nation's most  important forces must reach a basic agreement, because, if the  current situation continues, the big winner in the 1996  elections will be absenteeism and frustration.    The creation of a movement is feasible when several existing  parties and other leaders who do not belong to any party can be  incorporated. I do not want to spearhead this movement, but I  would like to take part in it. We will see whether in this  effort there is a need for some to go one way and others the  other way, and if one has the desire to participate in this.    [Alvarez] In your eagerness to seek political consensus,  could the FSLN pass you a bill for your flexible position with  Violeta Chamorro's government?    [Ortega] I already have paid a political price with regard  to  the militant Sandinist sector. Nevertheless, I did what I had  to do, and I have received the approval of many other citizens.  I am convinced that it is even more important to save Nicaragua  than to save the FSLN. The people now understand that  polarized, confronted, or divided, all we produce is poverty.    [Alvarez] It is no secret that you and your brother Daniel  Ortega currently have very large differences in your political  concepts. To what do you attribute this distancing between the  two of you?    [Ortega] I am currently in a very difficult situation,  because I have against me the Sandinist leaders of the two  political currents. I am criticized because a process of  hegemonism still prevails, and maybe the moderates believe that  I can compete with them in this area. On the other side of the  fence, they know that by my leaving the Army before the  elections I might compete for the FSLN party leadership.    [Alvarez] Could we say that the differences between you and  Daniel Ortega boil down to fact that he wants to maintain the  party leadership at all costs?    [Ortega] Every leader undoubtedly wants to be in control of  his movement. It has fallen upon Daniel to lead the most needy  sectors. By working and sharing every day with the most  resentful groups -- people who expected greater benefits from  the government and yet did not obtain them -- his feelings have  hardened. He cannot exercise his leadership through  conciliatory positions, because the people who have fallen into  despair because of their economic situation do not understand  any other position. I, however, am playing the institutional  role. I am seeking to leave the nation's Army removed from any  political party.    [Alvarez] You now speak of conciliatory positions, but your  refusal to leave the Army was one of the causes that produced  greater confrontation and instability in Nicaragua. How can you  explain this?    [Ortega] What is most important here is that we reached an  agreement with Violeta Chamorro's government, and we are all  happy to have reached a consensus on this issue.    [Alvarez] But, could this have been reached earlier, thereby  avoiding confrontation?    [Ortega] The problem is that this matter cannot be assessed  in terms of individuals. I could not leave without having the  Military Law approved. I have played a leading role in the  Army, considering the lack of a more specific law. If the  Military Law's approval is obtained at the Legislative Assembly,  the Army will not function so much in terms of individuals.  Instead, it will be ruled on institutional grounds.    I could not leave under the conditions that prevailed last  year, because I was not ready at that time, and also because I  was subjected to a series of events that were not the most  tasteful.    [Alvarez] Do you believe that Major General Joaquin Cuadra,  who has been mentioned as your possible successor, will continue  the work you initiated in the Army as you have planned it?    [Ortega] I believe he can, because it is not a matter of  placing one man in charge of this task. No matter who is at the  helm, he will continue the work within an institutional  framework and within a very specific timeframe -- that is, five  years. It is no longer a matter that he be another Humberto  Ortega. Instead, he will sail on another course.</p>

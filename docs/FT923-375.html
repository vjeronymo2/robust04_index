			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Syria sees no change in Israeli stance THE LATEST round of Middle East peace talks in Washington failed because the new Israeli government was no different from its predecessor on the issue of withdrawing from occupied lands, Syria charged at the United Nations yesterday. Mr Farouk al-Shara, the Syrian foreign minister, asserted that the claim by Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's Labour prime minister, to have changed policies and priorities 'lacks until now credibility in actual application'. He repeated that a settlement must be based on the inevitability of Israeli withdrawal from all occupied territories, including the Golan Heights, and 'the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people'. Anyone in Israel who believed total peace could be achieved without this or that saturating the country with a sophisticated military arsenal could guarantee security was gravely mistaken. 'Any manoeuvre for partial withdrawal or intermediate steps will not bring peace either to the region or to Israel itself.' Referring to Israeli calls for talks at a higher level than those held so far, Mr al-Shara described it as an attempt to undermine the framework and mechanism agreed at the Madrid peace conference last year which began the latest peace process. He reaffirmed that Syria wanted an honourable peace, but this must mean that 'no grain of sand of our land is lost and no concession of any of our rights is made'. Reuter adds from Jerusalem: Earlier yesterday Mr Rabin said peace between the two countries was in the hands of Syrian President Hafez al-Assad. He told Israel Radio that Syria had to agree to talks at the highest level but said an imminent summit was unlikely.</p>

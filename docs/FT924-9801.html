			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / End of drink ration cheers the Faroese THE inhabitants of the rugged Faroe Islands in the North Atlantic are getting their first taste of unrationed, over-the-counter alcohol after the lifting of a Draconian 85-year-old drinks law, Reuter reports from Copenhagen. Until this week, each Faroese had to order liquor and wine from Denmark, subject to individual rationing, and delivery would take place between eight and 10 days later. Now, with the opening on Monday of the islands' first liquor, wine and beer store, the waiting is over. About 1,000 of the islands' 47,000 inhabitants lined up for the inauguration of the monopoly store in the capital, Torshavn, to experience for the first time what it is like to buy alcoholic drinks over the counter. Before the law was lifted, the ration was 12 bottles of liquor from Denmark every three months. Beer could be bought from local breweries, but had to be ordered a day in advance. Politicians on the Faroes, a self-governing Danish province, believe the change will lead to a more moderate and relaxed drinking culture. The original law was introduced to combat a serious drinks problem on the islands, but people effectively circumvented it by ordering their maximum rations to be on the safe side.</p>

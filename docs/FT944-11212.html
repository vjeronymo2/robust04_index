Other main cities with populations of well over 2m are Harbin, Xian, Nanjing, Chongqing, Dalian, Jinan, Changchun and Qingdao. China's estimated population is 1,185,170,000 - nearly a quarter of the world's total population. Ethnic groups The number and percentages of main ethic groups include Han (Chinese), 1.042bn (91.96%); Zhuang, 15.4m (1.37%); Manchu, 9.8m (0.87%); Hui 8.6m (0.76%); 7.3m (0.65%); Uygur, 7.2m (0.64%); Yi, 6.5m (0.58%); Tujia 5.7m (0.50%); Mongolian 4.8m (0.42%); Tibetan, 4.5m (0.41%). Race and language The population of China is primarily of Mongoloid descent. About 93 per cent is Han, the remainder consisting of 56 groups known as the minority nationalities. Four major language families are found in China, the most important being the Sino-Tibetan, spoken by the Han Chinese. Currency The yuan/renminbi is illegal tender for payment of hotel, travel and other services by foreigners travelling in China. The current exchange rate (November, 1994) is approximately Yn8.5 to US Dollars 1. Foreign currency must be declared on entry. Visas Visas are essential for visitors to China. Regulations regarding visas have been in a state of flux: it is now possible to present oneself at any large Chinese point of entry and be given a two-week visa on the spot. Visas are also issued by the Hongkong office China Travel Service at 77 Queen's Road, Central, Hongkong, or at 27-33 Nathan Rd, Kowloon and at the People's Republic of China Visa Office, China Resources Building, 26 Harbour Rd, Wanchai, Hongkong.

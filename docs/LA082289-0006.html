			<p><P> August 22, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'A NEW AGE' OF ENERGY SAVING  </P> <P> Your editorial is a timely review of the benefits of energy conservation.  </P> <P> However, California developers, contrary to public belief, are intimately  familiar with the most stringent energy regulations in this country. After all,  they could not get building permits if they did not meet the tough state energy  code.  </P> <P> Building industry associations throughout the state are attempting to simplify  the approval process to broaden use of new energy-conserving materials and  equipment. In 1983, the building industry developed a way to calculate energy  conservation which is now considered an ideal model for future regulations.  </P> <P> The real issue is how to educate the public on the benefits of energy  conservation. According to a leading research laboratory, 50% of residential  energy consumption is a function of life style, regardless of the energy-saving  devices installed by builders.  </P> <P> Most of the energy waste comes from houses built before 1978. No significant  energy reduction campaign has been directed to this segment, only token  incentives.  </P> <P> How can we stop the current trend toward more electrical appliances, wasteful  packaging and larger, gas-guzzling cars?  </P> <P> Politicians will not do it for fear of voter rebellion. Manufacturers will not  do it because of enormous targeting costs.  </P> <P> Educating the public is a task The Times could initiate. Please put your pen  and energy to work and start the process.  </P> <P> MEL WYNN  </P> <P> President  </P> <P> Building Industry Assn.  </P> <P> of Southern California  </P></p>

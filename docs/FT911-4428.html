			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / UK Company News: Increased loss for Molyneux Estates Molyneux Estates showed an increased loss, from Pounds 149,000 to Pounds 267,000, in the half-year ended December 24 1990. Mr David Lewis, chairman, said that the figure took into account rising income receivable and also a deficit of Pounds 191,000 (Pounds 59,000) within the Overgate Centre associate, pending substantial rent reviews and new lettings. These were expected to begin coming through in the next financial year. In a reference to finance, Mr Lewis said total direct and indirect indebtedness currently amounted to Pounds 18.7m at an annual cost of about Pounds 2.46m. Current net rent receivable, including Overgate and rent reviews from March 25, was estimated at Pounds 2.31m annually, and the current rental value was put at Pounds 3.5m arising from reviews and reversions between 1991 and 1994. Turnover rose to Pounds 909,000 (Pounds 613,000) and losses per share came to 1.47p (0.82p).</p>

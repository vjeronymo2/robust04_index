			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> EL SALVADOR;  </P> <P> 9TH SOLDIER ARRESTED IN SLAYING OF JESUITS  </P> <P> A ninth soldier was arrested in connection with the slaying of six Jesuit  priests and two others after he fled from a courtroom last Friday during  questioning, military sources said. The order to arrest Sgt. Oscar Armando  Solorzano came after he "was caught giving false testimony and contradicted  himself several times" while testifying as a witness in the controversial case,  a court spokesman said.  </P> <P> Solorzano is a member of the commando unit of the elite U.S.-trained Atlacatl  battalion that was countering a rebel offensive in the capital last Nov. 16,  the night in which the priests, their housekeeper and her teen-age daughter  were killed. Solorzano was accused of being present at the site of the slayings  in declarations by several of the eight soldiers being held on murder charges  in connection with the controversial case.  </P></p>

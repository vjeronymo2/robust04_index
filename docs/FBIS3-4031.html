			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Jackie Sam] </F>   [Text] The average Hong Konger finds National People's  congress (NPC) and Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference (CPPCC) proceedings about as interesting as  Legislative Council meetings -- close to nil. Both only draw  attention by the theatrical and the penned darts from newspaper  commentators which generally pass for "public opinion" here.    This year's NPC-CPPCC meetings have been extremely dull. But  there has been no shortage of political "entertainment" for Hong  Kong people.    For sheer pathos, there was nothing to beat Mr Law  Cheung-kwok's troublesome hand. By his own admission, the  feeling of nationalism was so overpowering that his hand just  shot up -- joining a host of others who support a resolution on  the dissolution of Hong Kong's pre-1997 British-made political  structure when China resumes sovereignty over the territory.    Economist, securities firm director and vice-chairman of the  Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood, Mr Law's  errant hand didn't just raise eyebrows, it also raises some  important questions about Hong Kong people.    The first -- whether he has gone against party policy -- was  quickly answered by Mr Law himself. He had. Tearfully, he  explained that he had been so overwhelmed by the nationalistic  sentiments, he didn't know what he was doing.    But somewhat naively, he said he still subscribed to the  "spirit of the statement". The following day, he denounced the  CPPCC as a "hand raising machine". If he thought those  statements would somehow absolve him, he was mistaken. The  Liberals and the media were after his head. He flew back,  apologised to all, resigned from his party post and returned to  the conference -- certain in the knowledge that the media  commentators would not allow him to put the incident behind  him...ever.    As far as the majority of media are concerned, he can kiss  goodbye the West Kowloon Legislative Council seat that he's been  eyeing since 1991.    The incident highlighted the extent to which media people  have become polarised over political reforms and 1997.    Mr Law's move also raised the even more important question  of  how much the Hong Kong media and the Liberals -- really  understand China. More than a billion people live across the  vast expanse of China, for whom Hong Kong is an emotional issue  of terrifying proportions. Neither the CPPCC nor the NPC, need  to orchestrate the raising of hands when it comes to adopting  resolutions on the recovery of Hong Kong, especially when  accompanied by denunciations of the British. Many of those  members would be quite prepared to lead a charge across the  border to reclaim Hong Kong with their bare hands. It is that  emotional.    It is the same emotion which has driven Ms Dorothy Liu  Yiu-chu all these years -- and partly helped propel her into her  star turns this year.    To say she is angry over the appointment of several people  to  various national organisations who had previously served the  British, is an understatement. She is raving mad about it.    So, to wide applause and laughter from Hong Kong, she took  it  out on the Chinese leadership. Her first turn was an obvious  winner as far as the media was concerned. Prevented from  meeting Hong Kong reporters in her allotted room at the Beijing  Hotel, she rented another room on a different floor to host her  own talk-shows.    Her next turn, however, didn't bring the house down. People  thought she had gone a bit too far in making fun of Premier Li  Peng. Most people recognised that Mr Li's slip of the tongue --  for a split second blaming China for the breakdown in  Sino-British talks over Hong Kong's political reforms was only  all too human.    The day after his speech, she turned up at a Hong Kong group  meeting to say that although the text had correctly blamed the  British and had been distributed to all deputies in advance,  most had not read it and had listened to the speech instead.    She was aghast that none other than the prime minister  himself had put the blame oh the nation. Could he clarify? The  response was stoney silence. Some would probably have thought  it unbecoming of a daughter of a national hero.    Undeterred, she turned on XINHUA's Hong Kong director, Mr  Zhou Nan. Ever since the establishment of the Preliminary  Working Committee she had been mad at him. Was it not him and  Mr Lu Ping who appointed those "turncoats" -- former Executive  Councillors Ms Rita Fan, Ms Maria Tam and Sir S.Y. Chung -- to  the PWC and the CPPCC? She didn't quite put it that way. It  would been too nice. Instead, she told the panel: "In Hong  Kong, we have someone who behaves like a decadent son of a very  rich man, wasting away the family treasures." Pointedly, she  explained that the man who had amassed the family fortune was  none other than Mr Xu Jiatun. And the wastrel Mr Zhou Nan.    Considering that Mr Xu has defected to the United States the  comparison was devastating.    The "fortune" refers to the support gathered by the affable  Mr Xu. Some of those supporters have been disappointed by Mr  Zhou, a rigid hard-liner who probably would have nothing to do  with anyone who had served the British, if not for orders from  on high and the requirements demanded for a united front. It  was a terrible slap in the face for Mr Zhou. And it came from  someone who fully understands how important face is in this  community. Mr Zhou maintained a stoic silence. It won her top  marks from the media.    She didn't let it rest there. Accosting Mr Zhou in the lobby  of the Beijing Hotel, surrounded by the a group of Hong Kong  reporters, she demanded: "Is your appointment legal?" Or words  to that effect.    Some months ago, Mr Xu said in his serialised memoirs from  California that Mr Zhou's appointment (in the confused period  after Tiananmen in 1989) had not gone through the formal  procedures of approval by the NPC.    The post of director in Hong Kong is equivalent to that of a  minister.</p>

			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / International Company News: Baltica returns to the black with DKr25m Baltica, Denmark's largest combined accident and life assurance group, moved back into the black in 1993 with group net profit of DKr25m (Dollars 3.7m), compared with a 1992 loss of DKr445m. For the second consecutive year, no dividend was proposed. Group premium income slipped to DKr8.33bn from DKr8.51bn, but general insurance premium income rose for the first time sine 1989 to DKr3.38bn from DKr3.36bn. Assets increased to DKr112bn from DKr101.5bn, but equity capital was reduced to DKr5.67bn from DKr7.81bn at the end of 1992. Losses on financial guarantee business cost Baltica DKr220m last year. It also lost DKr95m on a US subsidiary, but said the general insurance business had developed satisfactorily. The group forecast an improvement in 1994 as a result of continued cost reductions and increases in premium rates. Baltica Insurance is up for sale after the collapse last year of its former parent company, Baltica Holding, which has changed its name to Gefion, but yesterday's report made no mention of the sell-off.</p>

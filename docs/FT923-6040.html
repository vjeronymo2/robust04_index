			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Daewoo to produce cars in Uzbekistan DAEWOO, South Korea's fourth-biggest conglomerate, is set to produce 180,000 cars a year in Uzbekistan from 1995, in one of the biggest automotive deals yet signed in the former Soviet Union, local agency reports say. The Russian Interfax news service reported that Daewoo had agreed to form the car-manufacturing joint venture with Avtoselkhozmash, an Uzbek state company. Three car models will be produced at a tractor trailer plant in Asaka. The Daewoo deal highlights the interest that many foreign car companies are now showing in breaking into the potentially vast market in the Commonwealth of Independent States. Yesterday, Moscow staged its first international motor show since 1913, enticing most of the big western companies into exhibiting some of their latest models. Mr Andrei Loginov, president of the Russian Automobile Federation, said the Russian car market was growing by more than 600,000 units a year, including an increasing representation of foreign brands. Many western companies said they were attending the show as a marketing exercise, but were also hoping to develop channels to distribute their cars in Russia. Mr James Walker, a representative of Trinity Motors, which has recently started distributing General Motors cars in Russia, said the market was a lot stronger than many people realised. 'We have researched this market for two years and looked into whether there are really buyers here. 'We think about 3 per cent of people in Moscow could afford to buy a Dollars 30,000 (Pounds 15,075) car,' Mr Walker asserted. 'We are talking about a total of 300,000 people.' Volvo, the Swedish car company, which has long had a representation in Russia, estimates it will sell 5,000 cars this year, more than twice the number for 1991.</p>

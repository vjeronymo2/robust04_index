			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by K. Swart] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg April 25 SAPA -- Bomb blasts damaged at  least four polling stations on Sunday [25 April] night and  Monday morning. The stations hit by the bombings were in  Potgietersrus in the Northern Transvaal, Boksburg north on the  East Rand, Bloemhof in the Western Transvaal and two in  Steynsburg in the Eastern Cape.    Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] spokesman Ben van der  Ross said the IEC was examining alternative sites and other  requirements that had arisen as a result of damage to voting  stations.    The IEC did not foresee any difficulties in establishing  alternative polling booths at short notice or directing voters  to nearby stations. Further information would be made known to  affected communities through the nearest IEC sub-provincial  office.    "The IEC deplores the loss of life in the spate of bombings  during the night and this morning," Mr van der Ross said. The  two explosions in Steynsburg on Sunday night caused an estimated  R10,000 damage to the Khayamandi community hall polling station,  SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio news  reported.    A second explosion rocked the town hall a short while later,  causing slight damage. There were no injuries in either  explosion and no-one had claimed responsibility by Monday  morning. It was not yet known what type of explosives were used.</p>

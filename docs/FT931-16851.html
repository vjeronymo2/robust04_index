			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Construction Contracts: Leeds restoration project Historic Queens arcade (pictured right) in the centre of Leeds is being restored to its Victorian splendour under a Pounds 2.7m contract awarded to JOHN LAING CONSTRUCTION by the Arcade's owners, Co-operative Insurance. In order to minimise disruption and ensure business as usual, Laing will be holding regular liaison meetings with traders throughout the 45-week contract. Work involves constructing shop units behind the retained facade at the Briggate end of the arcade. These will replace the recently demolished structure. In the the arcade itself the cast iron railings and balcony are to be carefully restored, the roof re-glazed and the terrazzo flooring replaced. The fire protection will be upgraded and all the shop fronts and elevations restored to their former glory. Work is due to be finished in October.</p>

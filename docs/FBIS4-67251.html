This was confirmed by Social Defense Under Secretary Mario  Soliz. He stated, however, that the military troops are not  involved in the struggle against drug trafficking.    [Begin Soliz recording] Right now military troops, like any  ordinary citizens, are circulating in the Chapare zone, and some  of them are carrying out training exercises. They are also  investigating the possible existence of narcoterrorism. [end  recording]    Soliz commented that the troops in El Chapare are subject to  the Defense Ministry, and not to the Social Defense  Undersecretariat.    The under secretary said that many peasants oppose the  presence of the Leopardos [Mobile Police Unit for Rural Areas,  UMOPAR] because they are involved in drug trafficking.    [Begin Soliz recording] The operation Amanecer [Dawn] was  carried out in Sinahota, and within 2 hours some 6 kg of cocaine  were seized. Moreover, 45 maceration pits and 32 cocaine  factories were found during the course of the day. This is  really frightening, because the average number of maceration  pits UMOPAR members usually find ranges from six to eight per  day. [end recording]    Recently the government approved a decree referring to the  industrialization of coca leaf, which was not welcomed by the  leaders of the coca farmers.    [Begin Soliz recording] There is a surplus coca leaf  production that is illegal; these are illegal plantations. The  government can therefore by no means authorize the  industrialization of something that is illegal, as this would be  illogical; it would mean violating laws and, I repeat, this  makes no sense. [passage omitted]    Mario Soliz asserted that the mentioned decree cannot be  modified as the Chapare leaders have requested.    In turn, he asked them to fulfill the commitment to  voluntarily eradicate part of the surplus production.    [Begin Soliz recording] What we want to say to them, in the  first place, is: Gentlemen, let us eradicate 3,000 hectares,  because if we do so the country will receive $20 million which  it needs. We are not talking about compulsory eradication. The  law clearly states that we must eradicate between 5,000 and  8,000 hectares. But we want to reach a consensus. [end  recording]    Soliz then said that with or without a consensus, the  alternative development plans and the voluntary eradication of  coca plantations will in any case be implemented in Chapare.    [Begin Soliz recording] We do not want to resort to violence  because, after all, the government has the necessary tools to  see to it that the law is respected, but we believe that  interdiction is not the best alternative at this moment if we  are able to reach a consensus.

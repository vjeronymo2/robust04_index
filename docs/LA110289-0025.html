			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INTO THE NIGHT  </P> <P> The Scene: Monday night at Morton's, where Spy magazine threw a highly  anticipated third anniversary party for the ultra-hip and super-trendy East  Coast periodical. The evening was co-sponsored by NBC, which will present the  magazine's coming TV special.  </P> <P> The Buzz: "Boy, there are a lot of agents here," mumbled at least half a dozen  guests, slipping outside for some air. Indeed, it looked like a scene from the  CBS comedy "The Famous Teddy Z," as power-suited studio types swapped business  cards and made plans to take meetings.  </P> <P> Who Was There: Besides every agent in town, one could spot comedian Harry  Shearer; writer Merrill Markoe; media critic Eric Burns; political consultant  Patrick Caddell; actress Mariel Hemingway; "Batman" star Michael Keaton;  professional gossips the Hollywood Kids; "thirtysomething" star Peter Horton;  producer Larry Gordon; Spy editor E. Graydon Carter; Spy's elusive Hollywood  correspondent Celia Brady; "Family Ties" star Justine Bateman with her steady  boyfriend, Leif Garrett, and NBC Entertainment President Brandon Tartikoff.  </P> <P> Chow: Fresh shrimp, mini-burgers, drumsticks and potatoes Anna with caviar,  brought through the crowd on trays by beleaguered waiters who looked like they  were having a miserable time.  </P> <P> Pastimes: Trying to squeeze through the standing-room-only crowd; trying to get  a drink; trying to find your agent in the crush. One actress, who refused to be  quoted by name, left quickly, complaining, "My agent didn't even recognize me  in there!"  </P> <P> Whoops: Brandon Tartikoff, the ostensible co-host of the party, went virtually  unnoticed at the door. As he tried to enter, one door woman snapped, "please  check in sir," before another embarrassed staff person whispered the word to  let him in.  </P> <P> Triumphs: If one needed any demonstration that Spy is a hot item in Los  Angeles, the party proved that there are hundreds of trendy types in town who  were willing to beg for one of the highly coveted invitations to the event.  </P> <P> Glitches: Many and unpleasant. The room was overcrowded to the point that  waiters hoped aloud that the fire marshal would not make an appearance. Guests  who went out to the patio through an open door just to get some air were  stopped from coming back in and forced to wait 10 minutes in line all over  again to re-enter at the front door. Waiters circulated outside to take drink  orders, but security personnel came around after the waiters to take the drinks  away and inform guests that they weren't allowed to drink anything outside.  After this, quite a few guests stomped out and headed elsewhere.  </P> <P> Irony: There were precious few creative, talented people at the party. Instead,  the turnout was largely composed of the same sort of shiny-suited  schmoozemeisters that are usually skewered in Spy magazine. KEVIN ALLMAN  </P></p>

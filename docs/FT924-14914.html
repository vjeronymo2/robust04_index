			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Opec output rises to 24.7m barrels a day OIL production by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries increased to 24.7m barrels a day in September, according to the International Energy Agency. Opec agreed at its ministerial monitoring committee meeting in Geneva last month that its market share in the fourth quarter of 1992 should be 24.2m b/d - the equivalent of freezing its claimed August production level - although Kuwait would be allowed to increase production as it continued to rebuild its oil industry after the Gulf war. However, the IEA's report follows surveys by the Reuters news agency and the magazine Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, which both put real Opec production last month at at least 500,000 b/d higher than the agreed level. The IEA forecast worldwide oil demand in the fourth quarter at 68.2m b/d - compared with 68.1m b/d in the same quarter last year - suggesting demand for Opec oil could be about 25.5m b/d. Analysts still expect this to produce a tight market and higher oil prices. Worldwide demand for the year 1992 is estimated at 67.0m b/d, 0.3m b/d more than 1991.</p>

			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JUDY COLLINS WILL SOLO AT IRVINE BARCLAY THEATRE  </P> <P> Judy Collins has been signed for a solo show at the Irvine Barclay Theatre on  Oct. 9, a theater spokesperson said Thursday, which will make her the first  nationally known performer to appear there.  </P> <P> The $17.6-million theater is to be launched with speeches by local dignitaries  and a brief ceremony Sept. 30, after which the 750-seat auditorium will be  thrown open to the public for inspection.  </P> <P> The facility is owned by the city of Irvine, UC Irvine and the theater's  nonprofit operating company.  </P> <P> The first performance of any kind will be given Oct. 7 by the South Coast  Symphony in what officials consider "an acoustic tuneup" for the hall. After  Collins' show, the National Theatre of the Deaf will stage a production Oct.  10.  </P> <P> Concluding the first week of festivities, on Oct. 12 a "Trustees' Gala" to  raise funds (at $250 to $300 a ticket) will feature five veteran Broadway  performers doing numbers from the musicals for which they won Tony Awards: Gene  Barry ("La Cage aux Folles"), who will also host the benefit; John Cullum  ("Shenandoah"); Donna McKechnie ("A Chorus Line"); Michael Maguire ("Les  Miserables") and Judy Kaye ("The Phantom of the Opera").

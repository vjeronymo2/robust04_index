			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Major to decide on ITV takeovers DIVIDED ministerial opinion means Mr John Major will have to decide whether ITV ownership should be changed to allow the nine largest companies to take each other over. A meeting, to be chaired by the prime minister, will be convened later this autumn to reach a decision. Both Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, and Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary, have written to Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary, opposing relaxing the rules because of the threat to regional programmes. Relaxation of the rules has been argued vigorously by the largest ITV companies such as Carlton and Granada, but opposed by companies such as Meridian, Anglia and HTV. The nine largest ITV companies are banned under the 1990 Broadcasting Act from taking each other over. A change could have a dramatic effect on the share price of a number of ITV companies that could become bid targets - such as London Weekend Television, Anglia and Central. Mr Major will also have to decide whether to extend the moratorium on other takeovers of ITV companies which runs out on January 1. These are possible at the moment, but the Independent Television Commission's considerable discretion will be much reduced from next year. A moratorium, supporters say, would give more time for thought on complex matters such as digital technology and the potential for a large increase in the number of channels available. An extension would need legislation. A number of large ITV companies plan to ask the government to bring forward the date when the bids for their franchises can be reviewed. The 10-year licences, issued at the beginning of this year, can be reviewed and extended after six years. Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television, which bid a total of Pounds 53.3m for the now merged Yorkshire and Tyne Tees franchises, will tell the Commons national heritage committee next month that a review should take place in 1996. Lord Hollick, chairman of Meridian, the south of England ITV company which bid Pounds 36.52m, also wants to see a review after four years rather than piecemeal changes. The National Heritage Department has given no indication that it is willing to look again at the ITV system and Mr Brooke has made it clear that he wants to draw a line under the 1990 Broadcasting Act and concentrate on a review of the BBC. Staff at Independent Television News were warned in a letter from management yesterday to expect more job cuts in a review of working practices and staffing. Working practice changes set out in the letter include journalists making increasing use of cameras and learning basic tape-editing skills. In the past few years there have been several hundred redundancies at ITN in a bid to cut costs.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, April 11 (AFP)--An Azerbaijani air raid on  Stepanakert, main city of the Armenian-dominated  Nagorno-Karabakh enclave, killed three people and wounded nine,  all of them women and children, defence officials there said.    The attack came Sunday. A second attempted raid Monday was  driven off by anti-aircraft fire, the officials said.    They said ground fighting was continuing in the north-east  of  the enclave, now in its sixth year of war, especially around  Mardakert after Azerbaijani forces mounted an offensive.</p>

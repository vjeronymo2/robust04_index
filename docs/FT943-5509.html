			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Banish this elitist to Bermuda Triangle Sir, The blatant elitism portrayed by Michael Thompson-Noel ('The English coast and its holidays from hell', August 27) is a perfect illustration of the class prejudice which continues to inhibit economic growth in the UK. His damning attack on English seaside resorts as 'clapped-out and working class whose fate is to play host to the poorest and least sophisticated of Britain's stay-at-home holidaymakers', is a slur on resorts and an insult to a vast sector of society. Far from being a fate, a resort such as Great Yarmouth prides itself in providing a range of facilities, attractions, entertainments, heritage appeal and surrounding countryside enjoyed by 2.6m visitors each year. We all know there are changes in holiday patterns, but the more enlightened resorts such as Great Yarmouth are responding to them and the seaside remains the core of domestic tourism. Perhaps when Mr Thompson-Noel is exploring his 'fave' Sarawak or sunning himself on a beach in Penang he will spare a thought for those poor unfortunates who cannot afford to join him and have to put up with their version of the Far East on the Norfolk coast. As our local newspaper, the Eastern Daily Press, put it, incredulous at the tenor of the article, maybe next year dear Michael should try a sailing holiday in the Bermuda Triangle] Tony Wright, chairman, economic development committee, Great Yarmouth Borough Council, Town Hall, Great Yarmouth, Norfolk NR30 2QF</p>

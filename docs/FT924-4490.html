			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Ideas sought for May Day future THE government yesterday launched a consultation document on whether the May Day bank holiday should continue in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Mr Michael Forsyth, employment minister, said there had been criticism of the grouping of holidays between mid April and late May, with the lack of a bank holiday between late August and Christmas. The consultation document invites views by 28 February 1993. Any change to the May Day bank holiday would be unlikely before 1995. The government has made clear that any change would not apply to Scotland. Consultation document. Alison Moore, IRD3, Level 4, Caxton House, Tothill Street, London, SW1H 9NF. Free.</p>

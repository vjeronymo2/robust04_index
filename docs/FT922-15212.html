			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris falls back as Cresson clings on TOKYO'S DROP and domestic uncertainty weighed on bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS fell in nervous trading on fears that Mrs Edith Cresson might stay on as prime minister after all. However, optimists still believed that she would be replaced by the finance minister, Mr Pierre Beregovoy, and expected an announcement today. The CAC-40 index fell to 1,919.87 before recovering to close 14.36 lower at 1,928.07. Turnover was modest at FFr2.7bn, with Perrier accounting for FFr558m. Paribas lost another FFr12.10 or 3 per cent to FFr382 as the bank gave details of its UK exposure to London analysts. The insurer AGF rose FFr8 to FFr508 in volume of 122,880 shares which was virtually made up by two block trades. Sommer Allibert, the industrial and home equipment maker, added FFr46 or 3.4 per cent to FFr1,405 in spite of a 62 per cent slide in 1991 profit. Analysts attributed the rise to speculative buying on hopes of a management change after criticism from leading shareholders. The stock is also viewed as a turnround situation. Bic, the razor and pen manufacturer, jumped FFr34 or 4.9 per cent to FFr719 after reporting better-than-expected 1991 results. FRANKFURT reversed Tuesday's gains, as an absence of corporate news depressed sentiment. A speech by Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank deputy president, in which he restated the view that wage increases must be reined in, also weighed on the market. The DAX index fell 10.65 to 1,707.30, while the FAZ index, calculated at midsession, was 0.91 weaker at 698.95. Turnover fell to DM4.8bn from DM5.1bn. Lufthansa closed down DM5.20 or 3.6 per cent to DM145.10 on unconfirmed reports that the airline had suffered a DM400m loss in the first quarter. Allianz weakened DM36 to DM2,118 after the cartel office said that it had written to the insurer asking it to reduce its 47 per cent holding in Dresdner Bank. An Allianz official said that the group will give an initial response today. Dresdner put on 40 pfg to DM350.20. Deutsche Bank, which is expected to release good 1991 earnings today, advanced 50 pfg to DM713.50. Among car makers BMW, which reported a 24 per cent increase in first quarter group sales, in line with forecasts, fell DM2.00 to DM572.50. Volkswagen slipped DM2.50 to DM361.30. Schering, which has been under pressure following an analysts meeting last week, weakened DM9.30 at DM802.20. MILAN calmed down after Tuesday's rebound and dealers expected little change ahead of the general election at the weekend. The Comit index rose 1.67 to 504.10 in turnover estimated at L85bn after Tuesday's L90bn. Sip, the telephone company, ran into some profit-taking after Tuesday's gains, falling L11 to L1,445 as volume remained heavy at 8.5m shares. Banca Nazionale dell' Agricoltura tumbled on fears that the state-owned Credito Italiano would sell its stake in the bank, following a report in a Rome newspaper quoting Mr Franco Nobili, the president of the state holding company, IRI. BNA fell L315 or 6.1 per cent to L4,890. Credito controls 8.5 per cent of BNA's shares and 22.4 per cent of Bonfiche Siele, the holding company that controls a further 48 per cent of BNA. BNA and related issues were temporarily suspended in early March because of a dispute about ownership. ZURICH, which rose moderately in early trade, weakened after the release of data suggesting that inflation was increasing. The SMI index finished down 10.5 at 1,826.7. Swissair bearers closed up SFr7 at SFr745 after announcing group net profits of SFr83m and a resumption of dividend payments. The chemical sector, which has performed strongly this week, weakened on profit-taking. Ciba-Geigy bearers and registered shares fell SFr20 and SFr10 to SFr3,470 and SFr3,480 respectively. Roche bearers eased SFr60 to SFr4,290. AMSTERDAM lacked domestic news and investors appeared to turn their attention towards companies with a US exposure. One analyst commented that the positive economic news coming out of America would benefit those stocks. Wessanen, which derives 40 per cent of its operating earnings from America, gained 30 cents to Fl 91.80. Philips was also stronger, rising 40 cents to Fl 36.80 and Royal Dutch advanced 50 cents to Fl 141.70. The CBS Tendency Index fell 0.2 to 124.55 in turnover of Fl 516.5m. STOCKHOLM followed overseas markets lower. The Affarsvarlden general index closed at 994.7, down 5.2, in turnover of SKr399m after SKr521m. Volvo B fell SKr3 to SKr415 on reports that its partner Renault is in negotiations with Citroen. BRUSSELS's Bel-20 Index ended 3.52 lower at 1,189.49. In retailers, Delhaize eased BFr20 to BFr9,410 on profit-taking, while GIB reversed a three-day decline, climbing BFr16 or 1.2 per cent to BFr1,348. MADRID eased with the focus mainly on blue chips. The general index closed down 2.19 to 253.28 in turnover of Pta10.5bn. ISTANBUL declined ahead of a four-day holiday. The 75-share index fell 14.44 to 4,062.18 in turnover of TL247.6bn after TL392.8bn.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                    FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - APR 1                          Hourly changes  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  Open    10 am     11 am     12 pm    1 pm    2 pm     3 pm    close 1143.79  1144.70  1145.68  1143.58  1142.33 1141.99  1141.08  1141.13                  Day's High  1145.68    Day's Low  1140.80              Mar 31    Mar 30    Mar 27    Mar 26     Mar 25             1149.80   1145.80   1140.84    1146.25   1144.53  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

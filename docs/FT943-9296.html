			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / N-team may visit N Korea The US and its western allies may send a team of experts to North Korea to examine about 8,000 spent nuclear fuel rods that could soon pose a radiation threat, diplomats said yesterday, Reuter reports from Geneva. Sending the team was part of an interim agreement being negotiated in US-North Korean talks in Geneva to allay fears over the fate of the uranium rods, they added. Wider negotiations on plans for North Korea to switch to a safer type of nuclear power technology were proceeding slowly and nothing more than a 'modest' agreement was expected. The heads of the two delegations, US assistant secretary of state Robert Gallucci and Pyongyang's deputy foreign minister Kang Sok-ju last met on Wednesday. Officials said Mr Kang and Mr Gallucci would meet again only if necessary. The talks are due to finish by tonight.</p>

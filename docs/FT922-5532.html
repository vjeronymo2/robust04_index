			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / UK Company News: First profit for Nissan UK with Pounds 18.4m NISSAN's British car manufacturing operations made a profit last year for the first time since the Japanese car maker began production in the UK in 1986. Nissan Motor Manufacturing (UK) achieved a net profit of Pounds 18.4m on a turnover of Pounds 779.4m in 1991 compared with a loss of Pounds 43.9m in the nine months to the end of 1990 on a turnover of Pounds 382.9m. Mr Ian Gibson, NMUK managing director, said yesterday that the company expected its profit to fall this year to less than Pounds 1m under the impact of heavy expenditure to increase production capacity for the addition of a second car range at the Sunderland plant. The company said that it had achieved its first profit 12 months ahead of schedule thanks to higher than expected production in 1991. The losses accumulated since 1985, which totalled Pounds 129m at the end of 1990, were reduced to Pounds 111m by the end of last year, and Mr Gibson forecast that the losses should be eliminated by 1995. Output of the Nissan Primera jumped to 124,663 last year from 76,241 in 1990 with 90.5 per cent of output exported. Sales rose strongly in Germany to more than 30,000, and NMUK is now exporting to more than 30 countries including Japan. Output is planned to rise to 175,000 this year, including 37,000 Nissan Micra small cars, which begin production in August. Production is scheduled to jump again in 1993 to 270,000 comprising 130,000 Micras and 140,000 Primeras, as the plant moves towards its presently planned full capacity of 300,000 cars a year. Nissan's investment at the Sunderland site will have totalled around Pounds 900m by 1993, of which Pounds 125m-Pounds 130m will have been provided as UK state aid. Nissan's investment in the UK totals around Pounds 1bn including the company's vehicle design and development operations at Cranfield, Bedfordshire and its UK marketing and distribution operations. The NMUK workforce at Sunderland totalled 3,770 at the end of 1991 and will rise to around 4,600 by the end of 1992, making it one of the largest manufacturing operations in northern England. The total Nissan workforce at the site will reach around 5,200 by the end of the year including more than 600 employed by Nissan Yamato Engineering, NMUK's 80 per cent-owned pressings subsidiary. Mr Gibson said that the Nissan Primera range had reached more than 80 per cent local European content. Component purchases by Nissan in Europe for the UK plant totalled Pounds 450m compared with around Pounds 145m spent on component imports from Japan.</p>

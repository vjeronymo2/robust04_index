			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Note:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The FAA's normal policy is that when an AD requires a substantive change, such as a change in its applicability, the ``old'' AD is superseded by removing it from the system and a new AD is added. In the case of this AD action, the FAA normally would have proposed superseding AD 91&hyph;19&hyph;01 to expand its applicability to include the additional affected airplanes. However, in reconsideration of the entire fleet size that would be affected by a supersedure action, and the consequent workload associated with revising maintenance record entries, the FAA has determined that a less burdensome approach is to issue a separate AD applicable only to these additional airplanes. This AD does not supersede AD 91&hyph;19&hyph;01; airplanes listed in the applicability of AD 91&hyph;19&hyph;01 are required to continue to comply with the requirements of that AD. This proposed AD is a separate AD action, and is applicable only to airplanes having serial numbers 5099 through 5131, inclusive.) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FAA estimates that 25 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 1 work hour per airplane to accomplish the proposed inspection, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed inspection on U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,375, or $55 per airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA estimates that it would take approximately 9 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed modification and the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts would cost approximately $199 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed modification on U.S. operators is estimated to be $17,350 or $694 per airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the figures, above, the total (inspection plus modification) cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $18,725 or $749 per airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> The Proposed Amendment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend 14 CFR part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

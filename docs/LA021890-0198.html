			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S.-STYLE CAPITALISM MAY NOT BE MODEL FOR EAST BLOC  </P> <P> With shocking speed, Soviet-style communism has vanished as an example for  other nations to follow. But does that clear the way for U.S.-style capitalism  to prevail in the world?  </P> <P> Not necessarily. The social protections of Western Europe, the industrial  conquests of Japan and the economic opportunities of America all have appeal.  Fledgling governments in Eastern Europe, many believe, may select traits from  each.  </P> <P> "I think they'll pick and choose," predicts Robert B. Reich, a professor at  Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government. "I don't think they  could or would tolerate the same degree of homelessness, crime and sheer  poverty in their populations that we manage to tolerate in the United States."  </P> <P> Liberal critics of U.S. policy contend that the social democracies of Western  Europe -- marked by strong safety nets, often at the expense of growth -- will  hold more allure for Eastern Europe than bare-knuckles capitalism, with its  winners and losers.  </P> <P> Others say the world's future role model will be based on economic performance  and that neither America nor Western Europe will be the first choice.  </P> <P> "Forty years ago, clearly the United States was the economic model," said Bruce  R. Scott, a Harvard economist. "But if you look at the last 40 years and ask  who's been the most successful in raising their standard of living, it's got to  be the Japanese."  </P> <P> Whoever is right, fundamental American principles may deeply influence Eastern  Europeans struggling to veer away from communism -- whatever examples they  choose to follow. That is because all leading industrial democracies adhere to  such time-honored U.S. values as the belief in private property and the rule of  law.  </P> <P> Eastern Europeans "should go back to Jefferson and Madison; there's nothing new  since then," declared Jerry Jordan, chief economist at First Interstate  Bancorp.  </P> <P> Certainly, the world's leading industrial democracies have much in common: They  all rely on the profit motive, private ownership and competition in the  marketplace, at least to some degree. For Eastern Europeans desperately seeking  to revive their own economies, the right role model may prove to be whatever  works for the moment.  </P> <P> Said Jordan: "I think the message they've been sending -- to the people they  kicked out and to the people who are jockeying to replace them is: 'We want  results, dramatically better results. And we want to see them fast'."  </P></p>

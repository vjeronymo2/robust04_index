			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / ICI chief warns banks against short-termism Pressure from shareholders could hamper banks' efforts to build supportive long-term relationships with large companies, Sir Denys Henderson, chairman of Imperial Chemical Industries, warned yesterday. Speaking in London at the International Monetary Conference, a meeting of senior executives from 103 large banks, Sir Denys said that banks should take a 'long-term supportive' stance towards customers. 'I suspect that the pressure on under-performing banks to improve their shareholder value will grow, which may make even the most tolerant more critical of clients' performance than in the past,' Sir Denys said. He added that a long-term supportive stance 'through fair and foul weather alike' was the normal model in Asia-Pacific, particularly in Japan. Germany's practice was also close to that of Japan but the tendency was less prevalent elsewhere. Sir Denys criticised some banks for being more interested in 'peddling the deal of the day' rather than preserving objectivity in the advice they offered to companies on how to improve performance. He said that while other industries wanted stability to make long-term investment plans, 'some parts of the banking industry welcome volatility, which generates excitement and the prospect of large instant gains'. Sir Denys said that ICI remained 'keenly interested in receiving innovative advice which will improve our financial performance' but that advisers should strike a balance between objectivity and keenness to do business. In a separate discussion on financial centres, Lord Alexander, chairman of National Westminster Bank, said that London would depend on its 'continuing capacity to innovate' and form the hub of a global network. He said there would 'always be the need for a leading centre in the European time zone, but Madrid, Amsterdam, Paris and Frankfurt all have their own aspirations' and London's position would be challenged. Baron Alexandre Lamfalussy, president of the European Monetary Institute, based in Frankfurt, said the European Monetary Union needed to be based in a sophisticated financial centre to perform its future role as a monetary authority. IMC members, who meet in a financial centre once a year to discuss matters affecting the international banking industry, were received last night at Buckingham Palace by the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh.

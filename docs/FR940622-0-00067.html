			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Section 1003.107: The regulations now reflect the requirement of section 1842(j)(3) of the Act that if an exclusion is based upon section 1842(j)(2) of the Act, then the access of beneficiaries to physician's services must be considered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Section 1003.108: We are revising this section to include the terms ``assessment'' and ``exclusion.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Technical revisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We have revised the regulation to reflect the statutory amendments relating to the term ``active labor.'' Section 6211(h)(1)(B) of OBRA 89 removed the term from the statutory definitions section (section 1867(e) of the Act) and the concept it applied to was incorporated into the definition of emergency medical condition. Hence, in many areas of the regulations, only the term ``emergency medical condition'' is included. However, the statute still uses the term ``labor'' in certain circumstances, and the regulations reflect this where appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under sections 6211(g) (1) and (2) of OBRA 89, the words ``patient,'' ``patients'' and ``patient's'' are replaced by the words ``individual,'' ``individuals'' and ``individual's'', respectively, each place they appear in &sect;&sect;489.24 and 489.53 in reference to hospitals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, we have redesignated proposed &sect;405.1903 in this interim final rule as &sect;488.18(d).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VII. Impact Statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Unless the Secretary certifies that an interim final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, we generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612). For purposes of the RFA, we consider all hospitals to be small entities. Individuals and states are not included in the definition of a small entity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis for any final rule that may have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. Such an analysis must conform to the provisions of section 604 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital as a hospital that has fewer than 100 beds and is located outside a Metropolitan Statistical Area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The provisions of this rule merely conform the regulations to the legislative provisions of sections 9121 and 9122 of COBRA (as amended by section 4009 of OBRA 87), section 233 of the Veteran's Benefit Improvement and Health Care Authorization Act of 1986, sections 9305 (b)(1) and 9307 of OBRA 86, section 4009 of OBRA 87, sections 6003(g)(3)(d)(XIV), 6018 and 6211 of OBRA 89 and sections 4008(b), 4027(a) and 4027(k)(3) of OBRA 90.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

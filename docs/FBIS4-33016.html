			<p>BFN     [Text] Santiago, 31 May (EFE) -- Israeli Foreign Minister  Shi'mon Peres said today in the Chilean capital that his country  will continue the peace talks, this time with Syria, Jordan, and  Lebanon.    In a news conference given a few hours after arriving in  Santiago, Peres, who was protected by a strong security force,  said Israel has "a very long agenda" for its Arab neighbors, and  reiterated that it is willing to continue with the peace process.    He said that he was, however, "bewildered" by the recent  remarks of Yasir 'Arafat about the "holy war," although he said  that to judge a situation one must look at the initiatives and  the facts.    Peres said 'Arafat had made a mistake, and that his comments  do not contribute to the peace process. But he preferred to  base his judgement on the implementation of the agreement, which  shows "that a new reality is taking place in Gaza and Jerico."    He noted that the PLO has not carried out terrorist actions  in those territories, and that despite the pain of this old  language used by 'Arafat, the plan is promising.    He recalled that the agreement granting autonomy to the  Palestinians of Gaza and Jericho is "temporary, for five years,"  and that after the political enrivonment changes permanent  agreements will be established.    He advocated relations with Latin America for the opening up  of new markets. He is also sure that the region will become  like the European Community, as the right trend is to make  "geographic proximity into economic advantage."    Peres praised the Chilean process, which he considered  "impressive" because of its political freedom and economic  stability which, he said, is quite an exception in the region.    Perez met this morning with Chilean President Eduardo Frei,  who reiterated Chilean support for the peace process with the  Palestinian people.    Peres said: "We talked about strengthening the old  friendship between the two countries in the fields of economy,  trade, and technological and scientific development."    Peres also met with Chilean Agriculture Minister Emiliano  Ortega and with his Chilean counterpart Carlos Figueroa, to  exchange views on the possibility of establishing joint business  initiatives and to share Israeli technology for recovering the  desert.    This program is one of the points of greater interest for  Chile, which has a large desert in the north. Peres said his  country is willing to provide all possible aid in this field.    He also said that Israel is open to trade negotiations with  Chile like the ones it proposed to Mexico and Colombia, the  other two countries included in his Latin American tour, which  ends tomorrow in Santiago.    Regarding international relations, Peres said that Israel  expects to receive Chilean support in its peace negotiations  with the Arabs at the United Nations, and that Chile will take  an "objective" position in that international organization.    He recalled that in Chile there is an important Arab  community which, he believes, should support Palestinian  autonomy in Gaza and Jericho just as the Jewish communities  abroad support Israel.    Peres declined to answer if his country would receive  Chilean  Army Commander General Augusto Pinochet, whose trip to Israel  has been announced a number of times. Peres said this  possibility has not emerged, and therefore it has no answer.    Peres also met today with Chilean Defense Minister Edmundo  Perez Yoma, and plans to lecture at the Chilean Foreign Ministry.</p>

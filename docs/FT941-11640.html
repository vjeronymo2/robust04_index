			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Observer: Pick 'n' mix What joy it is to belong to the Church of England, where theological beliefs are as easily replaced as a pair of trousers. Clearly Durham is the place, if one wishes to be at the cutting edge of conviction. Recently we had the Right Reverend David Jenkins as Bishop of Durham; he told us he did not believe in the resurrection - though it was 'much more than a conjuring trick with bones' he thought. Now we have as his successor the Right Reverend Michael Turnbull, who says he believes in the resurrection and Virgin Birth but not the Three Wise Men. He's also not sure about eternal damnation. Presumably he will wait and see.</p>

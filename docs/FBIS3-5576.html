The text of the royal message is as follows:    To H.E. Khieu Samphan, head of the PDK, through the Royal  Office in Phnom Penh.    Esteemed and beloved Excellency: I have already received the  statement you made on behalf of the PDK concerning the current  situation in our Cambodian motherland and the attitude of your  excellency's party on this matter.    With many thanks to you and your party for the noble and  lofty sentiment and confidence toward myself, I would like you  and your party to accept in return my best wishes with the  fervent hope that peace will be restored unfailingly on the  Cambodian land and national reconciliation and concord among all  our compatriots of all tendencies and political beliefs will  finally be achieved according to our wishes. Otherwise, it will  certainly be difficult for our motherland to avoid a danger that  could affect even its survival.    Please, your excellency and the PDK, accept the profoundest  and warmest regards from myself and the royal consort.    [Signed] Norodom Sihanouk</p>

			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Monday Interview: Moralist may work miracles - Rafik Al-Hariri, prime minister of Lebanon Rafik Al-Hariri, the 48-year-old Moslem prime minister of Lebanon, appears too good to be true. The billionaire businessman has given up his role as head of a multi-national corporation with interests in three continents for a thankless job with one of the shortest life expectancies. in the world. Over the next five years he has set himself the task of rebuilding his war-ravaged country as the financial and trading capital of the Middle East. His rags-to-riches rise has taken him from a lowly farming background to membership of the Forbes 100 list of wealthy individuals, with a personal fortune estimated at between Dollars 4bn-Dollars 6bn. Of that, he gives nearly Dollars 90m a year to charity, mostly in the form of scholarships to poor Arabs. Since his appointment as prime minister five months ago, thousands of Lebanese from across the country's political and religious divide have rallied to the man with the Midas touch. For many Christians and Muslims, the portly prime minister, known as 'The Sheikh' or 'The Uncle', has become a symbol of renewed optimism - a personification of the country's belief in its own renaissance. Across Beirut shopkeepers display his photograph in their windows and Lebanese newspapers have dubbed him 'Mr Miracle'. 'I was suspicious about him at first,' says Ms Rima Tarabay, an assistant to the president who used to fight with the Christian Lebanese Forces against Moslem militiamen during the civil war. 'But he is what he says he is. He is the only man who can do the job.' Mr Hariri himself believes he is the only man who can preside over the restoration of Lebanon - a country almost synonymous with civil war, terrorism and disintegration. In remarks to donors, diplomats and journalists, he often says: 'I want to go down in history as the man who rebuilt Beirut.' In an interview with the Financial Times he said: 'I think I can serve my country and make a difference. I have done a lot of unusual things. I had power without being in this position and I don't need the position to have power.' Mr Hariri has set a brisk pace on the road to reconstruction. He, and his team of 'technocrats', are starting to get to grips with an economy hit hard by corruption, poverty and mismanagement. The prime minister has speeded up a Dollars 5bn public and private investment programme to repair the country's infrastructure and rebuild the capital. As a sign of confidence in the new government, Lebanese businessmen repatriated at least Dollars 700m of the estimated Dollars 30bn-Dollars 40bn held abroad in the first three months of Mr Hariri's government, allowing the country to erase last year's balance of payments deficit. The Lebanese pound has been stabilised and efforts are under way to slash a 1992 budget deficit of LB1,200bn (Dollars 6.9bn). Next month, the government will meet representatives of western donor countries in Paris to seek up to Dollars 2.25bn for a three-year programme to repair and upgrade electricity, telephone, water and other main services. Mr Hariri has also begun to restore the tarnished image of Lebanon abroad. The armed militias who once ran makeshift roadblocks across the city and terrorised the capital have been disarmed. In what has become a mark of his government, Mr Hariri talks constantly about re-establishing the rule of law and a moral code of conduct. 'We have a choice: either live according to force or according to the rule of law. Now in Lebanon we are trying to restore the rule of both domestic and international law. That is the only way civilised people can live, otherwise the world will be a jungle.' Mr Hariri peppers his speech with words like 'ethics', 'morals' and 'principle' as he paces around his study, occasionally feeling the Islamic prayer beads stuffed into the waistcoat pocket of his suit. His words appear to be bearing fruit. Mr Hariri's campaign to rehabilitate his country took a leap forward last month when Mr Warren Christopher, the US Secretary of State, became the first senior US official to visit Beirut in nearly a decade. The restoration of confidence has been boosted by the way Mr Hariri and his team talk about rebuilding Lebanon as if they are about to put up a small office block in Texas. 'If things go well, by 1996 we will have an airport which will handle 6m-7m passengers a year, 1.5m telephones lines, 3,000MW of electricity and we should have solved the problem of the displaced people and have a train system across the country,' he said. 'This is not a dream. It is real.' This grandiose vision is more believable from a man who started his working life as a teacher and part-time accountant in Saudi Arabia and who now owns one of the biggest construction companies in the Arab world, as well as banks, hotels, and properties across Europe and the US. Most of his fortune was made building hotels, cities and palaces in Saudi Arabia. He owns homes in London, New York, Paris, Monaco and Riyadh. But while his corporate approach to solving seemingly intractable problems has its advantages, it can also be a weakness. As the honeymoon of his premiership draws to a close, Mr Hariri is beginning to realise that running a country is not as easy as running a conglomerate. His style remains very much that of a tycoon - short nights, long days starting with 'power breakfasts' with a handful of his closest aides, telephone calls on portable cellular phones, an impatience with problems and a tendency to expect his instructions will be carried out promptly. Sometimes he dips into his private funds to speed up the work programme. His company paid for the master-plan for the Dollars 2.5bn-Dollars 3bn private sector redevelopment of downtown Beirut which aspires to remake the city into the 'Paris of the Middle East'. His 'get things done' executive style of government, has, however, already landed him in trouble with Lebanon's political class, anxious to protect its vested interests. Six weeks ago he clashed with President Elias Hrawi, a Maronite-Christian, over civil service appointments. Mr Hariri had failed to consult sufficiently with the president. The clash, now resolved, led to a temporary attack on the Lebanese pound by speculators and symbolised the lingering suspicion of the Maronite-Christian community about the increasing power of the prime minister's office. In an admission of the difficulties in navigating the unfamiliar world of politics, Mr Hariri said: 'Running your own business, you are the master of yourself. Here, you have to consult much more.' Any solution to the political and economic problems of Lebanon will involve hammering out a peace agreement with Israel, under which Israel will withdraw its troops from its self-declared security zone in south Lebanon. Without an Israeli withdrawal, Mr Hariri will find it hard to counteract the Islamic fundamentalist group Hizbollah, which continues to resist the Israeli occupation, and to press for the withdrawal of the 40,000 Syrian troops throughout the country to the Beka'a Valley. Without these two signs of progress, he will be unable to win over the Christian community. Political stability and economic development will remain elusive. 'Don't underestimate the Israeli occupation in the south of Lebanon. This is our major obstacle,' Mr Hariri said. 'It is as if we had a poison bullet in our body. If there is occupation, there is resistance, and reaction to resistance.' Mr Christopher's visit undoubtedly boosted Mr Hariri's drive for a solution to this problem and for Lebanon's bid to be accepted in the family of civilised nations. Many observers agree that Mr Hariri has given his country its best opportunity for peace and economic resuscitation since the civil war began in 1975. Whether that opportunity is grasped depends largely on the domestic and international response to his call for the return of the rule of international law to the region. 'I cannot imagine life without principle or law,' he said. 'Nothing can go on without a basis of religion, law, principle and morals. I cannot imagine life and work without that.'

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] It was learned on 1 February that the United States  plans to accept the "bidirectional" concept in the Japanese-U.S.  framework trade talks on the issue of insurance market access in  both nations. The United States apparently has begun to soften  its position in a bid to break the deadlocked situation as the  upcoming Japanese-U.S. summit meeting lies just ahead. During  the vice- ministerial talks held in Washington last week, the  United States expressed its understanding for holding  discussions in a bidirectional manner, according to an  international financial source. Japan and the United States are  to exchange views on matters they are concerned about. They are  currently "at a stage where work is being done vigorously to  determine how to incorporate this (in the reports)" (as stated  by a senior Finance Ministry official).    As for the "bidirectional" idea, it was expressly stated in  the joint statement announced at the Japanese-U.S. summit  meeting last July that "consultations will take place under the  basic principle of a two-way dialogue (between Japan and the  United States)." However, the United States has so far refused  to alter its position that the purpose of the framework trade  talks is to correct the closed nature of Japanese markets, not  to discuss the problems of the United States. As a result, this  has stalled the trade talks in general.    Meanwhile, the United States has also demanded that  objective  criteria be designated to help increase foreign insurance  companies' share of the Japanese market to the level of that of  the markets of other major industrialized nations (G-7). Japan,  however, has refused to change its attitude of a complete  rejection of this, saying, "Objective criteria could become  numerical targets" (as stated by a Finance Ministry official).  Consequently, the talks on insurance issue are expected to  remain entangled until the final moments before the bilateral  summit meeting.</p>

He is also very  much concerned with the implementation of all of `China's agenda  for the 21st century.' My father still makes it a routine  practice each day to finish work. He reads a lot, and he walks.  We even played bridge the day before yesterday."    During the news conference, many overseas reporters asked  about Deng Xiaoping's health. Answering a question raised by a  Hong Kong reporter, Deng Nan said: "I understand your concern  for my father's health. We are used to all kinds of talk about  his health."</p>

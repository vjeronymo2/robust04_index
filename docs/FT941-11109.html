			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Property: Yes, you can live on the Riviera - Despite being a playground for the rich, ordinary people can find affordable homes there Seventy years ago, winter was the high season on the French Riviera. Once the railway opened along the coast, it took only 31 hours from London to Nice. And in the novel Tender Is the Night, Scott Fitzgerald wrote about a hotel near Cannes which (in 1925) 'was almost deserted after its English clientele went north in April.' Later in the 1920s, the sun cult took over and life has never been the same. Estate agents now must always emphasise the possibilities for sunbathing. Villas have gobbled up the Mediterranean hillsides and swimming pools have been blasted from the rock. Money has submerged the old fishing villages as the centre of the region has tilted from the inland towns such as Aix, Avignon and Nimes to the coast. Is anything left in this rich garden of hedonism that ordinary people can afford? Yes, if you look hard. But it might have to be an apartment, or a house over to the south-west towards Toulouse. The Romans, who gave Provence its name - it was in the provincia (province) of Gallia Narbonensis - must have found it an extension of Italy with its rocks, prickly scrub, thyme, sun and olive trees (olives in France grow only in the south coastal zone and up the Rhone valley). The Greeks would have thought the same. Many centuries earlier, they founded Marseilles and started one of the greatest of their many contributions to civilisation - making wine in France. Hardly anything else survives of the Greek tradition, but Arles, Orange and Nimes have splendid Roman remains while Avignon is a magnet for those interested in the Middle Ages. Nature-lovers can choose between the rock plateau of Les Baux (which gave its name to bauxite, mined nearby) to the marshes of the Camargue, the delta at the mouth of the Rhone where migrating flamingoes rest. For art fanciers, galleries abound with Impressionists; Mont Ste-Victoire, dominating the A6 motorway, is immediately familiar from Cezanne's paintings. Cuisine is strong on garlic, tomatoes and fish. Sarah Francis, of Sifex, says it is difficult in Provence to find a house of character for less than FFr2m (about Pounds 226,000), even though prices have come down around 30-40 per cent in local terms since 1988/89. On the other hand, the franc stays strong. But with France expected to come out of recession in about a year, Knight Frank &amp; Rutley's Patrick Dring feels this could be an excellent time to buy. Bargains are few, however, and chances are best in new developments where you might pick up the last apartment in the block at a good price, or with an extra like the garage thrown in. 'There is no harm making an offer. In a quiet market, you might be lucky,' says Hilary Katz, of Azur Internationale in Cannes. For FFr1.1m, she offers a ground floor flat in Cannes near the Old Port, with a swimming pool in the gardens. For FFr2.35m, there is a top floor flat in a development which also has two tennis courts. Outside Antibes, Sifex is selling a flat with sea view for FFr1.5m; and John Taylor offers two, both on the top floor, for FFr2.1m or FFr2.65m. Villas on offer start at FFr1.45m (down from FFr1.65m, perhaps because it does not have a pool) at Mougins, the cobbled village near Cannes and Antibes (from Azur International). Ten minutes' drive from there, Azur is selling a bastide (farmhouse), also lacking a pool, for FFr2.7m. At Roquefort les Pins, the agent has a villa with heated pool and garden (olives and figs included) for FFr2.8m. For FFr18m, there are Beauhavre, a lovely villa looking south across the bay of St-Tropez to the town (Knight Frank &amp; Rutley or Hugo Skillington) and La Porte des Iles at Mougins (Aylesford). Cheaper (from KFR) are the Villa Constance at Grimaud for FFr11m and, inland at the medieval hill village of Villecroze, a beautifully-restored farmhouse called La Ferrage St Jean for FFr6m. Most costly is the 1972 Villa Mabasque at St Paul de Vence for FFr22m (Hamptons or John Taylor in St Paul). Reduced from FFr29m, the price includes a 1957 Rolls Royce - not, however, an ideal car for the steep, narrow roads. La Bergerie at St Antonin-du-Var, another old inland village, costs FF6.9m (GAK Williamson). Alternatively, the vendor will sell one-third freehold shares for FFr2.3m through a British company. This makes sense, as few second home-owners spend more than four months a year at their property - yet they pay for 12 months' maintenance. To help out with costs, the house and its guest-house take up to 14 people. The same agent offers a village house in St Christol, between Nimes and Montpellier, for FFr1.575m. Inland, in the Luberon valley north of Aix, Coldstone House has an old property ready for occupation in the village of Roussillon for FFr1.96m, and modern houses in Lacoste for FFr 1.1m or 2.5m. At the top end of the scale, FFr4.5m will secure the wing of a medieval castle, needing work, for around FFr1.5m, and FFr8m buys a magnificent bastide with seven bedrooms. Adams House Management, Coldstone's sister company, will look after everything - including the builder to do any renovations. Partner Christian Adams finds the Luberon market more active since September. No large developments spoil the ambience of a lovely part of France, and the wine is good. The best buys, however, are further away in the south-west of France using Toulouse or Bordeaux airports. Sifex is selling a restored farmhouse near Montauban with about 16 hectares, including a two-hectare (five-acre) vineyard, for FFr1.65m, and a house on the river Lot for FFr1.59m. This has a boathouse and a pool, too.

			<p><P> February 24, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DISABLED DENIED PROPER STATE FUNDING, ADVOCATES SAY  </P> <P> Orange County advocates for the handicapped on Friday painted a bleak picture  of the quality of services provided to mentally disabled residents and  predicted a "crisis" in care if state spending is not increased.  </P> <P> "The effect of the (current levels of spending) is to direct problems back into  the community," said Richard B. Farmer, a representative of the Assn. of  Retarded Citizens. "People without adequate programs will roam the streets and  create havoc that will be reflected in increased police services and other  areas of the community."  </P> <P> The comments came at a state legislative hearing at Tustin City Hall that  attracted nearly 100 residents and officials from throughout Southern  California.  </P> <P> Three legislative subcommittees are looking into allegations that the state has  neglected services to the developmentally disabled and were seeking comment  from parents, service providers, consumers and local agencies on how the system  can be changed.  </P> <P> Friday's hearing was the last of 16 such community-based gatherings in the  state.  </P> <P> Many of those who testified charged that the state is providing inadequate  staffing at regional developmental centers and paying severely inadequate wages  for employees at state hospitals and community-care homes.  </P> <P> "At some of our community-care facilities, the clients are making more than the  staff who serve them," said Debra Marsteller, a representative of Orange County  service providers. Some of those who testified also denounced a proposal by the  state Department of Developmental Services to have parents with incomes of  $50,000 or more pay fees for some services.  </P> <P> Gary Macomber, director of the Department of Developmental Services, denied  that there has been inadequate funding for the handicapped. In testimony at  Friday's hearing, he called the proposed state budget increase of $59 million  next year for community services a "step forward" in addressing the needs of  the handicapped.  </P> <P> According to state figures, more than 95,000 people in Orange County are  developmentally disabled, including people with brain disorders, those who are  unable to walk, are blind or are deaf. About 25% reside in community-care  facilities while the balance live at home with their families.  </P> <P> Advocates for the handicapped say that many more patients could be housed in  community-care homes if more money was provided by the state.  </P> <P> The problem is especially acute in Orange County where the high cost of housing  has forced the closure of an estimated 300 community-care homes, said Rhys  Burchell, executive director of a Tustin-based social watchdog agency.  </P> <P> The agency, the Area XI Developmental Disabilities Board, has charged that the  state Department of Developmental Services is "out of compliance" with state  laws protecting handicapped people for not providing proper housing.  </P> <P> The group has threatened to sue the state and will hold a public hearing April  4 at Tustin City Council chambers.  </P></p>

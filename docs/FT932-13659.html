			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / UK Company News: Smiths lower despite medical boost - Aerospace division falls to Pounds 13.9m following civil aviation downturn THE DOWNTURN in civil aviation means Smiths Industries has for the first time made more profits from medical products than aerospace, the UK-based group's traditional core activity. Smiths, which reported a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 44.3m to Pounds 40.3m in the period, spent Pounds 122m on acquisitions outside aerospace during the six months to January 30. Mr Roger Hurn, chairman and chief executive, said he expected civil aviation to recover in the second half of the decade, but could not predict when. Delays in defence procurement and the reduction in civil aircraft programmes by customers such as Boeing caused trading profits from aerospace to slump from Pounds 18.2m to Pounds 13.9m, on sales down from Pounds 184m to Pounds 175m. Smiths has accordingly continued to reduce its aerospace workforce, cutting 200 jobs in the UK and 200 in the US, bringing the total to 6,000. The aerospace downturn was partly offset by a strong performance by the rapidly expanding medical systems division, which increased trading profits from Pounds 11.6m to Pounds 16.1m on sales which rose from Pounds 63.8m to Pounds 84.8m. Overall sales increased from Pounds 307.4m to Pounds 328m. Acquisitions were responsible for Pounds 17.1m of sales and contributed Pounds 3m to total operating profit of Pounds 38.6m (Pounds 37.8m). The pre-tax figure was depressed by a Pounds 3m provision to cover an unsuccessful investment in a device for measuring blood pressure. Despite the profits fall, shares in Smiths rose 7p to 347p. Mr Hurn said: 'All parts of the company have shown a resilient performance in this first half, and we expect to achieve steady progress in the remainder of the year and beyond.' Industrial, the group's third division, increased trading profits from Pounds 8m to Pounds 8.6m, in spite of being exposed to the worst effects of the recession. Sales increased from Pounds 59.6m to Pounds 68.4m. The division's ducting companies, especially Flexible Technologies, a US acquisition now in its second year with the group, had performed well. Smiths also said that Vent-Axia, a fans and hand driers maker bought for Pounds 56m in December, had proved a natural fit. In medical systems, Smiths paid Pounds 66m for Intertech Resources of Florida in October, and Pounds 16m for HG Wallace of Colchester in July. Both companies manufacture single-use products, mainly in the field of anaesthesia and respiratory products, and have been integrated with the group's existing businesses. Mr Hurn said: 'The medical systems group will be a major contributor to the future success of Smiths Industries.' In spite of the heavy spending on acquisitions, Smiths still had net cash of Pounds 5m. Interest receivable fell from Pounds 6.5m to Pounds 4.3m. Cashflow from operations increased substantially to Pounds 51.9m (Pounds 37.9m). Mr Hurn said he would be willing to borrow to make further acquisitions. Earnings per share fell to 9.2p (10.1p). The interim dividend is lifted by 5 per cent to 4.3p (4.1p). See Lex</p>

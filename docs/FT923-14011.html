			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Italian MPs linked to Milan scandal lose their immunity THE Italian chamber of deputies yesterday agreed by a large majority to waive parliamentary immunity on five of its members to face charges of alleged corruption, abuse of office and illegal financing of political parties in connection with the five-month old Milan municipal corruption scandal. However, a special session of parliament refused to allow members to be arrested, stipulating that they only answer the specific charges on which Milan magistrates had sought to have their immunity waived. Some of the five already face further charges and a new waiver will be necessary in respect of these. A total of 13 MPs and former ministers are currently under investigation by Milan magistrates in connection with the scandal, while a further nine are being investigated for alleged corruption in other parts of the country. So far, 76 local and national politicians have been either charged or are under investigation in the Milan affair which is having wide repercussions. The scandal itself forced the resignation of the Milan municipal administration and only yesterday, after exhaustive negotiations, a new council was put together under the former communist mayor, Mr Piero Borghini. Those on whom immunity was waived were three Socialists, Mr Carlo Tognoli, Mr Paolo Pillitteri and Mr Renato Massari, Mr Antonio del Pennino a Republican and Mr Gianni Cervetti of the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS). All held senior positions in their respective parties and are leading political figures in Milan and the Lombardy region. Mr Tognoli was minister of tourism in the previous Andreotti government and a former mayor of Milan; while Mr Pillitteri, also a former mayor of Milan, is brother-in-law of Mr Bettino Craxi, the Socialist leader. Mr del Pennino headed the Republican party in the chamber of deputies and Mr Cervetti was the shadow defence minister for the PDS. Yesterday Mr Tognoli continued to protest his innocence while Mr del Pennino welcomed the waiving of immunity in order to clear his name. The magistrates are alleging that the politicians formed part of a sophisticated system of rigged public works contracts and kick-backs worth millions of lire which largely went towards illicit funding of the political parties running the Milan municipal administration - the Socialists, Christian Democrats, PDS and Republicans.</p>

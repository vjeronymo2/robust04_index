			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE MATURE TRAVELER: HOTEL'S OFFER IS NOT TO BE DISCOUNTED  </P> <P> Hilton Hotels has updated and expanded its Senior HHonors discount travel  program for 1990, adding 76 hotels in more than 30 countries.  </P> <P> With the added hotels, Hilton's Senior HHonors members age 60 and over can get  discounts from 25% to 50% off regular rates at more than 310 hotels worldwide.  </P> <P> The program does not include all 140 Hilton International hotels. However, it  does cover nine in Canada and 20 in Europe.  </P> <P> Hilton guarantees that the discount rate will be the lowest published rate for  a hotel chosen, even lower than those offered to members of AARP, who are  eligible at 50.  </P> <P> With a senior discount, rates at the more than 310 domestic Hiltons can be down  to $45 a night, single or double. The average discount rate for the more  popular Hiltons is closer to $60, which is still a good deal.  </P> <P> And a second room at the same discount rate is also offered for a member's  immediate family, such as children or grandchildren.  </P> <P> Membership in the Hilton program can be on two levels -- $25 for an annual  domestic membership, $50 for a worldwide membership (which includes the 76  international hotels). There is also a $150 lifetime worldwide membership.  </P> <P> Membership in any category automatically includes a spouse. Hilton will refund  money to those who decide against using the program within 30 days of  enrollment.  </P> <P> Mature travelers who are already members of Hilton HHonors' frequent guest  program will receive 500 HHonors points per stay at the discounted senior rate  at domestic hotels.  </P> <P> All new senior members not already in the frequent guest programs are  automatically entered so they also can earn credits for the future travel  rewards and prizes.  </P> <P> With the discounts of 25% to 50%, the membership fee is usually paid for with  just one night's lodging. As examples, Hilton cites a $165 room at the Palmer  House in Chicago, available to Senior HHonors members for $60; a $130 room at  the Orleans Hilton, available for $70, and an $85 room at the Ocala (Florida)  Hilton that seniors get for $52.  </P> <P> Another benefit in the program provides a 20% dinner discount for two at more  than 240 Hilton Hotel restaurants in the United States, regardless of whether  members are staying at the hotel. (This is a retreat from last year, when only  a party of six or more got the discount.)  </P> <P> Other benefits include a special toll-free reservation service for Senior  HHonors members, pre-registration and quick hotel check-in at HHonors  registration desks, and late check-out times, if requested.  </P> <P> As good as the program and its discounts are, mature travelers should expect  the usual restrictions that can be found on most all senior discount programs  -- they can't be used in combination with other discounts or package tours, or  for conventions or group meetings.  </P> <P> Senior HHonors hotel reservations are required, because rooms at individual  hotels may not always be available at all times. Blackout periods can be  expected during major conventions, meetings and sporting or other major events.  </P> <P> On the other hand, reservations can be made up to a year in advance to help  assure getting the senior discount at the hotel and time of your choice.  </P> <P> For more information on the Senior HHonors program, call Hilton Hotels  toll-free (800) 455-8667, Ext. 901, or contact travel agents.  </P> <P> Corliss Tours has added a 12th destination, New Orleans, to its program of  Stay-Put Tours for 1990.  </P> <P> The eight-day tours will use the Montelone Hotel in the French Quarter for the  entire stay. City and countryside sightseeing tours will start from the hotel.  </P> <P> Tours include a paddle-wheeler cruise on the Mississippi River and a swamp tour  of the Bayou Country on a flatboat, plus visits to antebellum mansions and  plantations and a creole cooking class at the New Orleans School of Cooking.  </P> <P> Departures March 24, April 14, Oct. 6 and Nov. 10. Stay-Put Tours cost $840 per  person, double; $1,115 single. Transportation is not included, but it can be  arranged by travel agents or Corliss Tours.  </P> <P> Other 1990 Stay-Put destinations include Charleston, S.C.; Orlando, Fla.;  Washington, D.C.; Philadelphia, San Antonio, New York City, Boston, Montreal,  Toronto, Calgary and Vancouver.  </P> <P> For more information and a free Stay-Put brochure, contact Corliss Tours, 436  W.

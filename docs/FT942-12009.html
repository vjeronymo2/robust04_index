			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Orange off colour with its message Sir, As someone eagerly awaiting the arrival of the UK's fourth and last mobile phone operator before deciding which system to use, I have been disappointed with the launch of Orange. I can see where the Pounds 15m on advertising is being spent, namely on TV and one word poster adverts that tell you nothing about the product or how to get one. I have been into phone shops and am aware that there are plenty of handsets in stock. The only thing I don't know is how much it costs, as tariff sheets and contract details are in short supply. Whereas newspapers carried full tariff details on the launch of the Mercury PCN in both adverts and in articles, the garbled reporting of Orange's launch in last Thursday's FT - 'there are to be no monthly charges. Its plan for occasional users costs Pounds 15 a month including. . .' - does not help to clarify matters. Whatever happened to benefit selling? I feel that Orange's concept approach to marketing that overlooks its product's benefits is going to cost it dear. Or maybe the tariffs are best not explained in case they cost the customer dear. Alan Greene, 32 Glen Road, Fleet, Hants GU13 9QR</p>

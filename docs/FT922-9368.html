			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Tajik opposition consolidates hold A COALITION of Islamic and democratic opposition forces consolidated their control of the Tajik capital Dushanbe yesterday, after their apparent overthrow of the ex-Communist government. The situation last night remained very tense with both sides allegedly still holding hostages. Sporadic outbursts of gunfire continued throughout the city and former Soviet army tanks were patrolling the streets near their garrison. A protocol agreement, aimed at ending the bitter dispute between the opposition and the former communist government was yesterday signed by representatives from both sides after 24 hours of negotiations and fighting which left at least 20 people dead. Under the agreement, the Communist government has been replaced by a Revolutionary Coalition Council until parliamentary elections are held later this year. The democratically-elected president, Mr Rahmon Nabiyev is to be retained as nominal head of state. However, Mr Nazrullo Dustov, the powerful hardline vice-president, and other key government figures have been removed. The whereabouts of Mr Nabiyev and government ministers is unclear after reports that he had fled the capital. How effective the protocol agreement will be in defusing the situation is unclear. Many of the more radical opposition factions bitterly oppose any form of coalition with the former government. The opposition is divided over how prominent a role Islam should play in the future government. It seems unlikely that the northern regions of Tajikistan, traditionally a Communist party stronghold, will peacefully accept the new regime. A ceasefire has been declared and appeals have been made for all militia groups to be dismantled. Although the garrison insists it will not intervene in the conflict, it has been placed on full alert after two of its personnel were shot dead last night. Earlier in the day most of the pro-government militia groups and supporters who had been guarding the parliamentary buildings left the city in a convoy heading towards the Kulyab region, a stronghold of government support. As they left, opposition gunmen and armoured personnel carriers bearing the green Islamic flag overran the parliament amid a hale of indiscriminate shooting and shouts of 'Praise to Allah'. With weapons still spread throughout the city, further clashes and reprisals remain likely.</p>

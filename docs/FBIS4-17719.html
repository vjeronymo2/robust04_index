			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Gridneva] </F>   [Text] Dushanbe 27 April TASS -- Rizvon Alimardon, one of  the leaders of irreconcilable Tajik armed opposition in exile,  called on citizens of Tajikistan to support jihad (holy war)  against the present regime in the republic.    He calls himself commander of united armed forces of Tajik  Mujahideen. The appeal was printed in leaflets circulated in  some residential areas of Dushanbe on Tuesday [26 April] as well  as in the suburban Kofirnikhonskiy, Leninskiy and some other  districts of the republic.    The appeal signed by Rizvon says that the present  "pro-communist government" is responsible for all social and  economic evils of the Republic as well as impoverishment of its  citizens. Therefore, the government should immediately step  down.    Leaflets spell out in detail instructions on how to organise  resistance to government forces and to give aid to detachments  of domestic opposition existing in the Republic.    Competent Tajik bodies confirmed to ITAR-TASS the appearance  of anti-government leaflets, calling them a provocation by the  extremist wing of opposition, aimed at destabilising the social  and political situation and thwarting the second round of the  intra-Tajik talks on national reconciliation, which is to be  held late in May in a Moslem Mid-East country.    It was stressed that, since leaflets contained a call for an  overthrow of the constitutional system in Tajikistan by force,  competent bodies instituted a criminal case in connection with  this action.</p>

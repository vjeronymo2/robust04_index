			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / International Company News: Sharp increase in earnings at Siam Commercial SIAM Commercial Bank has followed other Thai banks in announcing sharply increased earnings for last year. Net profits rose 56 per cent to Bt4.18bn (Dollars 163.7m) in 1992 from Bt2.68bn a year before, while earnings per share rose to Bt109.51, from Bt82.87. Like all Thai banks, SCB has profited from the wide gap between deposit rates and lending rates in Thailand, a phenomenon that the commercial banks have collectively been able to sustain, in spite of quiet pressure from the central bank to narrow the gap. SCB's interest income rose 2 per cent last year, while its interest expense fell by 13 per cent, resulting in net interest income growth of 49 per cent. However, some brokers expressed disappointment that SCB's net interest income as a proportion of average assets was 3.7 per cent, lower than that of some of its competitors.</p>

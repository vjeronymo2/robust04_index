			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Susana Solis from the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>   [Text] A confrontation between members of the National  Action Party [PAN] and the Institutional Revolutionary Party  [PRI] resulted in some 40 people injured in Copainala, Chiapas.  Four persons had to be hospitalized.    The incident occurred when PRI supporters tried to dislodge  PAN members who had seized the municipal palace to demand the  removal of Mayor Maurilo Cortazar Aguilar from the municipal  presidency. The PRI members organized a march through several  streets of Copainala to express their support for Cortazar.  Once they reached the municipal building, they tried to  dislodge the PAN members. The PAN members repelled the  aggression and left the building following the squabble.    The state government has appointed deputy commissions to  conduct audits in municipalities such as Tuzantan, Huehuetan,  and Teopisca, where conflicts exist and where municipal palaces  have already been vacated.    The Chanal municipal palace was seized by people demanding  the mayor's removal. In Cacahoatan, there was a sit-down strike  in front of the municipal palace today. In addition, peasant  organizations have taken over at least 100 farms in several  municipalities.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by L. Rakhmanov: "Military Commissariats Appeal to </F> Patriotism"]    [Text] Yesterday, a conference concerning the issues  of the draft into military service was held at the mayoralty.  The conference was attended by representatives of the military  commissariats of the city, law enforcement organs, and heads of  rayon administrations.    Despite the 1993 quota for the draft into the Army having  been met, concern about the "unpatriotic sentiment" of the young  people of St. Petersburg was voiced at the conference. This  phenomenon has been registered among both the draftees and their  parents, who sometimes try to spare their children military  service by hook or by crook.    The number of persons without a secondary education has  sharply increased among the draftees. Such persons account for  40 percent at present.    Besides, the number of those unfit for military service  continues to increase. During the fall draft, 8,300 such persons  were registered; in 1993 as a whole, one in three was  "rejected." Many of the diseases are of the kind caused by drug  abuse.    The "evaders" are a special headache for the military  commissariats. In 1993, there were several thousand of them;  among them are both those who failed to report to military  commissariats and those who have changed their place of  residence. Search teams were organized, which succeeded in  bringing 14,500 [as published] people to the premises of  military commissariats. They did not succeed in locating 500  "evaders."    The staff of the district has now given the assignment to  draft 6,800 persons. Some of them have already reported to  induction centers. However, participants in the conference noted  that problems might recur during the spring draft in the absence  of cooperation between the organs of government, the military,  and the law enforcement organs. In particular, it is necessary  to computerize the operation of passport desks so that the  military commissariats will be able to promptly track changes in  the registered residence of draftees, as well as to revisit the  patriotic conditioning of young people.    It should be added that effective 25 May, the draft of  military reservists for active-duty training was suspended in  both St. Petersburg and Leningrad Oblast. This happened because  the Ministry of Defense of Russia is currently unable to finance  this training.</p>

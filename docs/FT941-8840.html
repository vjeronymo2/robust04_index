			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coal exporters reeling from second price blow The sharp reduction in coking coal prices agreed between Japan and its Canadian and Australian suppliers has been followed by an even bigger cut on the European market. In the first major European settlement for 1994 supplies the Canadian producer Fording has cut its prices to the Spanish steel producer Ensidesa by Dollars 4 a tonne. In Japan all the other Canadian and Australian coking coal exporters were forced to match Fording's price cut of Dollars 3.85, setting a new benchmark of Dollars 45.45 a tonne. With the Ensidesa agreement not only is Fording accepting an even bigger price reduction but it is cutting from a much lower base of Dollars 45 a tonne. While some Canadian producers have accepted that they will be forced to match the Dollars 41 price for sales into Spain, the ability of the Australians to accept this as a price setter will be limited. It is believed that only BHP Australia, the world's biggest coal exporter, will be able to accept the new Japanese benchmark; and even this company will be pushed to match the Ensidesa price if it becomes accepted elsewhere in Europe. Already the earlier settlement in Tokyo has led to a series of strikes in Australia, with Mr John Maitland, the United Mineworkers Federation president, urging the government against approving the new prices (the Department of Primary Industries and Energy has the right to block any coal price settlements - a power it seldom uses). Senior mining company executives who privately applaud Mr Maitland's view - if not his strike call - predict mine closures as a result of the new prices. Fording's willingness to accept lower and lower prices is driven by its desire to maximise tonnage from both Fording River - a mine that suffered an extended strike in 1992 and did not return to full production for the 1993 coal year - and Greenhills, which it purchased from the Westar Bankruptcy. And what is judged good for the mine is doubly so for its partner, the Canadian Pacific railroad, which carries all Fording's coal for export at Vancouver. Fording appears determined to produce and sell 9m tonnes this year, an ambition which in a weak market with increasing supply can only be achieved one way - by predatory pricing.</p>

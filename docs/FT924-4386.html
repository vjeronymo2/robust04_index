			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Money Markets: Sterling futures volatile MONEY market operations took comfort from a stronger pound and the fading of end-of-month pressures yesterday. Meanwhile, the Bank of England stayed out of the markets for the first time in more than two and a half years, writes Peter John. Most of the day's activity was seen in short sterling where the March contract opened 8 points off and moved sharply down to 93.19 at one stage, reflecting an increasingly pessimistic attitude towards the hope of further interest rate cuts. The gloom was largely prompted by early comments from the Bundesbank president Mr Helmut Schlesinger who reaffirmed the German central bank's commitment to current interest rates. Nevertheless, the March contract recovered later to close well up at around 93.40 with more than 33,000 lots traded and continued firm in after-hours dealing. The December contract which is being influenced by technical factors ahead of its expiry in two weeks time opened lower but recovered well during the day to close around 92.75. Dealers said French franc futures were also traded down heavily at the opening to reach 90.80 at their low before rallying to close at 91.26. They added that volatility was increasing in the markets as a number of people were starting to close down their positions towards the end of the year. Short-term interest rates were easier, partly as a result of the Bank of England staying away. In addition, Japanese banks, which have been taking funds heavily ahead of the year end, stood back after having rolled over many of their positions at the end of November. Meanwhile, following the record level of central bank help on Monday when nearly Pounds 4bn was provided the bank announced no shortage yesterday for the first time since April 3 1990. The absence of the shortage was explained by an unexpectedly high level of exchequer transactions, which came in at Pounds 365m. Also the bankers' balances, the money which the clearing banks have to hold to cover their deposit liabilities, were Pounds 230m above target. These positions were offset by treasury bills, maturing assistance and bills for repurchase.</p>

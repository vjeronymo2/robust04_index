			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE PROTEST AGAINST 'THE NORMAL HEART'  </P> <P> Like so many AIDS pieces in The Times, Koehler's article is blatant homosexual  propaganda.  </P> <P> I believe that the producers of "The Normal Heart" had every right to present  the play in Springfield, Mo. I also believe that local citizens had every right  to organize against it.  </P> <P> When have you seen a play produced for the truly innocent victims of AIDS, such  as those who received tainted blood?  </P> <P> It is fitting that the article's final word is "homophobia." After all, isn't  this the standard epithet used against those who dissent from the AIDS "party  line"?  </P> <P> RALPH W. BALLMER, Escondido  </P></p>

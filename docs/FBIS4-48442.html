			<p>BFN     [Text] In Nigeria, government preparations for the  election of delegates to the forthcoming National Constitutional  Conference are going ahead, but equally, a campaign to call the  whole thing off is also gaining momentum. At the center of  these demands for a boycott of the conference is the newly  formed National Democratic Coalition, and as Sola Odunfa now  reports from Lagos, the coalition's efforts are doing  particularly well in Western Nigeria:    [Begin Odunfa recording] The boycott campaign, spearheaded  by the National Democratic Coalition, appears to be spreading.  The support for a boycott of the Constitutional Conference is  gaining popularity, especially among political leaders in  Western Nigeria, home of Chief Moshood Abiola, the acclaimed  leader of last year's annulled presidential election. Nearly  all the major political leaders in the Yoruba-speaking west say  that they have withdrawn from the first stage election,  scheduled to be held on Monday.    Chief (Shegun Oshoba), the last civilian governor of Ogun  State says Nigeria is facing a crisis more important than the  constitutional conference, and the crisis should first be  resolved by reviewing the annulment of the presidential  election. Chief Michael Ajasi, who claims political leadership  of the Yoruba people, says none of the prominent politicians who  collected nomination forms in his home state, Ondo, returned  them. Significantly, the former national chairman of the  disbanded National Republican Convention, NRC, Dr. Hameed  Kusamotu, while not explicitly endorsing the boycott campaign,  called on the government to first convene a meeting of all  leaders of thought in the country to discuss the state of the  nation before the planned constitutional conference.    Preparations are in top gear in other parts of Nigeria to  ensure the success of the election of delegates. The current  situation suggests that the boycott, if it is effective, will be  only in the western states, and this will mean the absence of  credible Yoruba leaders from the constitutional conference. [end  recording]    Well as you heard, the campaign of the National Democratic  Coalition has been doing rather well in the south and southwest  of Nigeria. One of the prime movers of the boycott campaign of  the National Democratic Coalition is retired Admiral (Ndibisi  Godwin Kanu). On the line to Lagos, Mustapha Ibrahim asked him  what the coalition's boycott call was all about:    [Begin recording] [(Kanu)] The call is really expressing the  true wishes of Nigerians from all over the country. What  Nigerians want is a sovereign national conference, where issues  of proper federalism and other restructuring will be done. So  it is more of voicing out entirely what the people want.    [Ibrahim] The National Democratic Coalition seems to have  brought together a lot of people from only a certain part of the  country. What effort has the movement made to become a  broad-based, national movement?    [(Kanu)] As you know, Nigeria is made up really of many  nations. It is a country of many nations. You mention the few  from what you may call the southwestern part, or you may say the  Yoruba nation. I am not from the Yoruba nation. There are  people from the middle belt, there are people from the far north  -- you have Dambazau there -- but more than that, as I said, it  is not just a matter of the individuals you are looking at on  the paper, but a matter of all well-meaning Nigerians, and they  are all over the place.    [Ibrahim] Don't you fear being accused of being lackeys of  Chief M.K.O. Abiola?    [(Kanu)] The issue of Abiola is absolutely secondary.  Nigerians were called out to vote and they all voted -- and it  was a very peaceful and fair election in this country -- and it  got annulled. The people came out to vote and they left  everything else, ethnic considerations, religious bias, and  voted. It was very peaceful, and in a very good spirit of  brotherhood, and that is the position. So it isn't a matter of  Abiola at all. He may have his faults, he may have his good  points, but that is not what people are saying. They exercised  a franchise and they want to exercise that, and it is not a  matter of being a lackey to him. He is rather talking about our  national interest, and that goes for everybody, whether in the  present provisional government or outside of it. We have to  look at that, and the intention is to have a proper federalism  and a structure where there is a sense of belonging to  everybody. Right now, nothing is moving because patriotism is  not there.    [Ibrahim] Now, what will happen if the present military  regime defies this ultimatum that the National Democratic  Coalition has given that it must step down by May 31?    [(Kanu)] We believe it is in the interests of everybody,  including even those now in the government, to achieve this  democracy in accordance with the June 12 election and mandate.  We believe also they ought to consider it that way. It isn't a  matter of any challenge -- it is a simple matter that we, all of  us Nigerians, including those of them that are in government --  a few of them who are in the military and in government. The  bulk of the Armed Forces too is having things very rough. [end  recording]</p>

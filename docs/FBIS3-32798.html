Talks to disarm the Nicaraguan recontras of the  so-called Northern Front 3-80, led by Jose Angel Talavera,  a.k.a. Chacal, begin today. Local media sources report that a  peace commission composed of Catholic Church and CIAV  [International Commission for Support and Verification]-OAS  delegates have already made contact with recontra leaders to  establish the necessary conditions for the negotiations. The  people are afraid rifles will be heard again given the  recontras' mistrust for the military presence.    On Sunday, Monsignor Eddy Montenegro, vicar of the Managua  Archdiocese, advocated the rapid resolution of the situation in  the country's north. We hope the rifles will remain silent and  that the pacification process will move forward so Nicaragua can  tread the path of balance, he said during his homily at the  Managua Cathedral.    The disarmament talks will be held at El Naranjo, Nueva  Segovia Department, close to the Honduran border. Despite the  cease-fire announced separately on Thursday by the Sandinist  People's Army staff and rebel leaders, the presence of  government troops increased over the weekend, a CIAV-OAS  official reported.    Sergio Caramana, CIAV-OAS coordinator general, warned that  the peace commission's mediation might fail if the Army's  presence near the town where the talks with the recontras will  be held is maintained. A military source, however, denied that  the Army is hampering the Catholic Church and CIAV-OAS  mediation. We remain in our positions and maintain the  cease-fire to facilitate the disarming, the source added.    The suspension of Army offensive operations only covers the  Nueva Segovia Department, where the Northern Front 3-80, made up  of some 400 rearmed men, is stationed. The Army source said the  operation continues in the rest of the country, but declined to  report on any new clashes. In exchange for disarming, the  recontras operating in the country's north demand that the  government of Violeta Chamorro implement social programs for  Nueva Segovia Department peasants and protection for the  would-be demobilized.</p>

			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOSKIN ADVISES WEST GERMANY TO AVOID RATE HIKE  </P> <P> The White House's chief economist urged the West German central bank Thursday  not to boost interest rates as part of its strategy for coping with economic  integration with East Germany.  </P> <P> The comments by Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the White House Council of  Economic Advisers, reflected widespread concerns here that any further increase  in West German rates would quickly cross the Atlantic, damaging prospects for a  rebound in the sluggish U.S. economy.  </P> <P> Interest rates in Europe soared early this year as the political and economic  turmoil caused by the rush to unify East and West Germany left investors both  nervous about the prospects for inflation and eager to take advantage of a  potential capital investment boom. Because markets around the globe are linked  by virtually instantaneous communication, rate increases here promptly echoed  those in Europe.  </P> <P> "If you're a home buyer, you don't care if the pressure comes from home or  abroad," said Allen Sinai, chief economist at Boston Co., an economic  consulting group. "The bottom line is higher interest rates."  </P> <P> Boskin, in a breakfast with reporters, acknowledged that upward pressure on  West German interest rates will continue.  </P> <P> The cause, as it often is in the United States, is inflation. East Germany is  about to adopt the West German currency. Almost certainly, East Germans will be  able to convert their cash to West German marks at a favorable exchange rate,  designed to show them that they can look forward to prosperity if they stay  home instead of moving to the West.  </P> <P> The sudden large increase in money and the resulting demand for goods will  inevitably drive prices up in both Germanys.  </P> <P> Some officials at the West German central bank, the Bundesbank, believe that  the proper response is to force interest rates up. That is the same sort of  bitter medicine imposed by former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul A. Volcker that  worked to end the inflationary spiral in the United States a decade ago.  </P> <P> But Boskin argued strongly against such an approach. West Germany will  experience nothing more than a temporary inflation shock, he said, and after  that, prices should level off.  </P> <P> "The worst thing they could do is to tighten and cause a recession," Boskin  said. "There's no reason a one-time price hike should lead to a wage-price  spiral."  </P> <P> Boskin's message to the West Germans was unusually blunt. Administration  officials have generally shied away from talking publicly about German economic  policy since then-Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III rattled investors with  tough comments on the subject just before the October, 1987, stock market  crash.  </P> <P> The West Germans "shouldn't be tightening in anticipation of worrying about a  temporary increase in prices," Boskin said. "They should accommodate it."  </P> <P> He said that folding the Communist system in East Germany into West Germany's  vibrant capitalist economy -- a move that is likely to accelerate sharply after  East Germans go to the polls March 18 -- is like "buying an asset with a huge  potential future."  </P> <P> Germany's independent central bank, Boskin said, should simply accept the  "one-time price increase" that will result from currency unification. "That  would be better for the German economy," he said, "as well as putting less  pressure on interest rates elsewhere."  </P> <P> Many U.S. economists are worried that continued uncertainty over how West  German officials plan to handle the thorny issues of economic integration and  widespread anticipation of a flood of capital into Eastern Europe will continue  to drive interest rates up in Europe and the United States.  </P> <P> In recent days, U.S. officials and outside analysts have argued that such fears  may be overblown. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told lawmakers last  week that financial markets probably have already adjusted to anticipated  changes. Indeed, the German bond market pulled out of its tailspin slightly  more than a week ago.  </P> <P> John Hekman, an economist at Claremont Economics Institute in Southern  California, believes that investors "overreacted to the immediate threat of  inflation in Germany." But even if interest rates remain high in Germany,  Hekman thinks U.S. rates will gradually recede as investors return money to  Wall Street in the belief that they can earn a greater real return over the  long run from U.S. bonds than from West German securities.  </P> <P> Hekman acknowledged that the American economy is becoming increasingly  vulnerable to developments abroad.  </P> <P> "It's remarkable how much U.S. markets were pushed around by events in Germany  and Japan," he said. "We've been talking for years about the integration of  global financial markets. Now we see the results."  </P></p>

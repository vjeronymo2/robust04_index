			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Minding Your Own Business: A private guide through the corridors of power - A look at a company run by former civil servants who know the secret passwords of Westminster CHARLES Miller owns up to one or two weaknesses in the company he runs. Indeed, he concedes: 'We couldn't sell our way out of a paper bag.' But then, the Public Policy Unit's marketing requirements are limited. It exists to help companies and organisations find their way around the murky and misshapen corridors of Whitehall as they seek to influence government thinking and legislation. Do civil servants possess the gumption to make a working life for themselves once they depart the cushioned torpor of Westminster? The success of the PPU shows some do. But its staff are a rather select collection who work full time or on contract for the political and regulatory advice agency since it was set up in 1985. The 22 'members' of the company include political lobbyists, a journalist and prospective parliamentary candidates as well as former fast-track civil servants, most of whom worked in the private sector before coming to the PPU. Miller, the chief executive, worked with Lloyd's of London and as a political adviser for Tate &amp; Lyle as well as being a researcher in the House of Commons. The PPU unearths information about what the government is doing, and helps companies prepare and present cases - whether for a brewer, a drugs company worried about new laws, or an airline seeking a change in UK airport policy. Business has been lucrative. Turnover for its second full year was Pounds 200,000. Last year it was Pounds 770,000, yielding a pre-tax profit of Pounds 115,000. Miller says profits this year will leap to about Pounds 280,000, partly because of its merger in the next few weeks with another company with a similar turnover. The PPU, which has just seven full-time staff, is quite separate from the left and right wing think-tanks with rather similar names - the Institute for Public Policy Research and the Centre for Policy Studies (although the latter happens to be in the office next door). It started when eight people with connections in Whitehall decided to set up a company that would explain to corporate clients the workings of Whitehall and Westminster and the routes through which to influence decision-makers. 'If you knock on the door and say the secret code word, they will let you in,' Miller says. He used Pounds 7,000 of his own money to start the business while a now-defunct merchant bank took a shareholding and provided office space in the City. 'You don't need much money or equipment to start,' says Miller. The PPU has now moved to Victoria, close to its target area. 'Much of our work could be done from John O'Groats but clients think it's necessary to be near Westminster.' What is the biggest misconception companies have about Whitehall? 'They do not realise how low down decisions are made,' says David Lidington, a PPU member, former ministerial adviser and prospective parliamentary candidate. 'Most of the key decisions which affect businesses are taken at assistant secretary or principal level, not by permanent secretaries. Those lower levels are the engine room of Whitehall.' Apart from lobbying, case-building and presentation, the PPU runs training programmes to help executives understand government. It publishes a range of documents on such subjects as 'The background of MPs' and 'Lobbying - understanding and influencing the corridors of power.' The company has 32 clients including Procter &amp; Gamble, Salomon Brothers and British Airways. Retainers - which range between Pounds 1,000 and Pounds 15,000 a month - account for 65 per cent of its fees. Annual earnings of members range from Pounds 5,000 to about Pounds 50,000, depending on the fees they attract. Miller, who takes a salary of Pounds 38,000, is often caustic about Whitehall. 'You are working in this enormous structure where you might not know what's going on four doors down the corridor, where the switchboard does not always work properly, and where most of the staff are totally unmotivated.' He compares this with a small business. 'Suddenly, you are in a small firm where you really count. You've got real responsibility - if you don't do it, nobody will; and if you don't sell, you don't eat.' But he misses Whitehall, too. 'We are insiders who are now outsiders. I think we all miss being at the centre of things, being where the buzz is.' The Public Policy Unit, 50 Rochester Row, London SW1P 1JU. Tel. 071-828-6088.</p>

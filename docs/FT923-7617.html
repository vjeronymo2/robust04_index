			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / International Company News: C&amp;W talks could lead to listing for Mercury - Telecommunications group seeks strategic partner CABLE &amp; WIRELESS, the telecommunications group, is looking for a strategic partner to take a stake in Mercury Communications which could result in a separate listing for its subsidiary. Mr James Ross, chief executive, said: 'While Mercury does not need a link-up with another company we are looking for a strategic partner to invest in Mercury Communications. 'This would enhance its value within the group and would ensure the market valuation of Cable &amp; Wireless properly reflected the value of Mercury. A long-term option would then be to seek a separate listing for Mercury.' Cable &amp; Wireless is currently in negotiations to form a partnership between Mercury and US West, the North American Telephone company. Fears that US West would not receive the regulatory permission to take a stake in Mercury because it holds an international licence have so far proved unfounded. While Mr Ross declined to comment on any talks that may be taking place, he outlined the reason for seeking a partner for Mercury. 'We believe a strategic partner for Mercury would link its long-distance services with a local network and an equity injection could be used either to repay debt or make further acquisitions. We are, however, in no hurry to do a deal'. An enhancement of Mercury's value would make a separate listing more likely in the long-term since by selling a stake to another group it will have established a market price. The Hong Kong Telecom subsidiary of Cable &amp; Wireless has its own listing on the Hong Kong, New York and Pacific stock exchanges. The talks with US West underline the importance that Cable &amp; Wireless attaches to finding a strategic partner for Mercury to challenge the dominance of BT in the UK. As one of the 'baby bell' US regional companies born in the aftermath of the break-up of American Telephone and Telegraph in 1984, US West would need permission to take a stake in Mercury in order to participate in international services. The Federal Communication Commission, the US regulatory authority, said waivers to participate in international services had been given to 'baby bell' companies in the past and would probably be given in the future. Negotiations between the two companies may be prolonged. Cable &amp; Wireless is also negotiating with US West to take a stake in TeleWest, its cable television joint venture in the UK. TeleWest, which provides local telephone services, is a joint venture between US West and TeleCommunications, the US cable television group. The inclusion of a third party in the negotiations is one of the reasons why the talks are likely to be prolonged.</p>

			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / UK Company News: AromaScan valued at Pounds 35m in main market flotation AromaScan, the developers of an 'electronic nose' - a new technology to detect odours - yesterday announced plans for a stock market flotation valuing the group at between Pounds 35m and Pounds 40m. The float is expected to raise Pounds 12m, of which Pounds 4m will be set aside for working capital and Pounds 8m used to build a manufacturing plant and develop technology which, according to the company, has applications for industries ranging from food and drink to cosmetics. Mr Allan Syms, managing director, said it was a big breakthrough. 'We have developed the first machine capable of producing the digital fingerprint of a smell,' he stated. Unlike rival technologies, AromaScan's electronic nose relies on a large library of polymers to identify smells and produce digital print-outs. It can, for example, spot the difference between genuine and fake Chanel perfume or detect contamination in recycled bottles. That technology was pioneered and developed at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (Umist) and has been used by the US Food and Drug Administration and companies such as Whitbread and Unilever. Mr Syms estimated the potential worldwide market at Pounds 215m, although he warned that development costs were likely to lead to losses of Pounds 1.91m next year and Pounds 863,000 in 1996. The pathfinder prospectus, however, showed the group making profits of Pounds 4.02m in 1997 on projected turnover of Pounds 18.4m. Under the terms of the flotation - handled through a placing by NM Rothschild with Peel Hunt acting as broker - existing shareholders have agreed to retain their stakes for at least two years. They include AromaScan management, which currently holds 30 per cent; Umist with 10 per cent and 70 private investors holding the balance. Mr Fred Worth, finance and operations director, said funds raised by the placing would also be used to repay a Pounds 500,000 loan to Umist, while Legal and General - one of the original backers - would receive Pounds 300,000 from existing cash balances. Impact day is July 26 and dealings are expected to begin on August 3.</p>

			<p><P> March 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: COUNTRY MUSIC  </P> <P> Country singer Willie Nelson will be on stage to reopen what's billed as the  world's largest honky-tonk March 31. Billy Bob's Texas, in Fort Worth, boasts  three stages, 42 bar stations, a live indoor rodeo, and can pack up to 6,500  people into 100,000 square feet of floor space. The mammoth nightclub is  resuming a seven-day-per-week schedule of entertainment under the new  leadership of Ken Brixey, former general manager of Elvis Presley's Graceland  mansion, who also managed Southfork Ranch, setting of TV's "Dallas." Brixey and  a group of Fort Worth investors assumed the management of Billy Bob's Texas  last November, 10 months after the failure of other investments forced the  club's developer and namesake, Billy Bob Barnett, into bankruptcy. The club has  opened on weekends since Brixey's Link Management Group took the reins. ALEENE  MacMINN  </P></p>

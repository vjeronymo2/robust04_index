			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Imro chief quits after criticism of watchdog body over Maxwell MR GEORGE NISSEN, chairman of Imro, the fund management industry watchdog, resigned yesterday after widespread criticism of his organisation's role in the Maxwell affair. He said Imro was 'open to a share of reproach' but insisted much criticism of it had been 'misplaced'. Mr Charles Nunneley, a director of Imro and deputy chairman of Robert Fleming Holdings, the investment banking group, will act as chairman until a successor is appointed. The Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, is due to release a report later this week on Imro's supervision of Mr Robert Maxwell's fund management companies. The report is expected to criticise Imro for letting Bishopsgate Investment Management (BIM), one of Mr Maxwell's fund management companies, operate under a looser than normal regulatory regime. Imro's report to the SIB on its own supervision of the Maxwell companies concluded that it could not have barred them from operation but should have supervised them more closely. It also criticised professional advisers to the Maxwell pension funds for failing to alert regulators to problems they uncovered. Earlier this month, Mr David Corsan, an Imro board member and former partner at accountants Coopers and Lybrand, announced he would not seek reappointment. Mr Corsan had been a director of the Maxwell Charitable Trust, of which BIM was a subsidiary. It also emerged yesterday that two senior Imro officials closely involved with authorising and supervising Mr Maxwell's companies have resigned in the past two weeks. The Financial Services Act requires Imro to decide which fund management companies are 'fit and proper' to do business and to supervise their activities. Imro authorised two Maxwell-controlled fund managers, BIM and London and Bishopsgate International Investment Management. Mr Frank Field, Labour co-chairman of the cross-party group of MPs campaigning on behalf of the Maxwell pensioners, applauded Mr Nissen for resigning and accepting responsibility. Ms Marjorie Mowlam, Labour's City spokeswoman, also welcomed Mr Nissen's resignation and called on Mr John Morgan, Imro's chief executive, to do likewise. Mr Morgan has already said he will retire in September 1993, when his current contract expires. Pension pledge, Page 8 Observer, Page 17</p>

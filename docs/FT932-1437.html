			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Survey of Manchester and the Olympics (13): Just the tonic for Eastlands - Stewart Dalby describes why the Games will provide east Manchester with a way back from dereliction, disuse and the legacies of the industrial revolution / Urban Regeneration URBAN regeneration is one of the criteria the International Olympic Committee (IOC) will use in choosing which city should host the 2000 Olympic Games. One of Manchester's aims is to use the bid - and the Games, if it is successful - to regenerate a section of eastern Manchester. The government regards Manchester's bid as a national one, and has promised to find the Pounds 1.5bn for the facilities if the bid succeeds in September. The government has already committed Pounds 75m in seed money for facilities, plus a further Pounds 40m for environmental improvements. The government's decision to find this finance from urban aid programmes and put it down as a kind of deposit on the bid is significant. Although technically the city council must make the bid, it does not have the ability to raise the necessary funds. Some cities in the US and in continental Europe have the ability to raise taxes for special projects, such as the Olympics. The government's commitment, therefore, means that win or lose in September, east Manchester will gain new sporting facilities and an area which appears to have defied regeneration in the past will be upgraded. East Manchester was once the manufacturing heartland of the city but since the second world war it has been in decline. After the recession of the early 1980s traditional industries such as engineering and textiles have had little opportunity to revive. Although there are several large companies and there are 80,000 residents, large stretches are derelict. The area is dotted with empty factories, abandoned cotton mills and boarded-up shops. One barrier to development has been the poor infrastructure. But an inner ring-road now locks the area into the motorway network surrounding Manchester and this eases access. Another problem has been lack of finance. Manchester has two development corporations which concentrate on other parts of the city and which have been well funded by the government. Apart from a few housing projects financed under the urban programme, very little money has been diverted to east Manchester. The lack of finance for reclamation, clearance and improving infrastructure has deterred the private sector. Mr Terry Thomas, managing director of the Co-operative Bank and director of the East Manchester Partnership, says: 'East Manchester might seem ripe for property development. But I do not feel that regeneration would have taken place without some kind of catalyst. The money put up by the government is just the tonic the area needs.' East Manchester is appropriate for the bid because it abuts on Manchester city centre. If the main stadium is built on the proposed site then, together with the velodrome and another arena which are already being constructed, it will mean that 10 of the 25 Olympic events will be within walking distance of the Olympic village in the city centre. Some 15 sporting disciplines will be within the motorway ring and another 21 within 20 minutes' driving time. By contrast, in its abortive 1996 bid Manchester planned to build the stadium on an out-of-town greenfield site. A distinction should perhaps be made between east Manchester and the Eastlands regeneration project. East Manchester is an area of around 26 sq miles which stretches from Victoria and Piccadilly stations. It covers about one quarter of the area administered by the Manchester city council and houses about a third of the city's population. Within this area is a site of 140 acres which is the Eastlands regeneration project. The East Manchester Partnership is a grouping of more than 200 private concerns which hopes to attract private sector investment on the back of government spending. It is involved in the developments around Victoria station. Of the Pounds 75m of government money so far committed, some Pounds 37m is being spent on the Victoria Arena, a 16,500-seater covered venue for basketball and gymnastics. It is part of a larger development which could cost Pounds 140m and include offices, a five-star hotel, a cinema complex and retail developments. Further east, is the Eastlands project. Janet Heron, the Eastlands Project Co-ordinator, who has been seconded from the city council, says: 'Less than 20 years ago, on this site, there used to be a gas works, an electricity generator, a colliery and a large wireworks. It is now largely derelict.' So far, Pounds 10m of the Pounds 75m has been committed to the project with a further Pounds 20m to come. Much of this has been spent on assembling the land from various owners and arranging for relocations of companies to other parts of east Manchester. But work has started on the velodrome which will seat 5,000 and cost Pounds 6m. The showpiece of the Olympics is the new national stadium which is proposed for Eastlands. It will seat 80,000 people, cost up to Pounds 150m and host the opening and closing ceremonies. Like the arena, it would be the centre point for other developments. One estimate suggests there could be 500,000 sq ft of office space, retail outlets and other leisure facilities. Mr Thomas feels that even if Manchester's bid is unsuccessful, the stadium will still be built. He says: 'The country needs a new national stadium. The last one was built in Wembley in London in 1923. We need one in this part of the world.' He concedes that if the bid is unsuccessful, it might take a little longer for the project to get going. 'I think the private sector will grasp the nettle and build the stadium, but it could take around five years to get off the ground.' He says that even if the bid fails, east Manchester will receive Pounds 300m of investment arising from the Pounds 75m injected by the government. He says: 'I doubt very much whether the area would have received that kind of investment without the stimulus of the Games bid.'</p>

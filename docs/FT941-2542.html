			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Back to save us Dead Hollywood stars will return from the grave if developments in re-animation technology bear fruit. According to a recent news story: 'Using raw data culled from old films and the latest digital computer animation, Hollywood scientists are perfecting (techniques) to create synthetic actors who look, sound and move just like the real thing.' Quite soon, celluloid legends such as Vivien Leigh and James Dean could be starring in new films, alongside living actors. 'The era may be approaching when old actors neither fade away nor die,' said the news story, 'but star time and time again, long after their mortal remains have turned to dust. Instead of appearing in person at the Oscar ceremonies, they could send along computer images to weep and thank and celebrate. No one would know the difference.' One of the names by which the new technique is known is Live-Synchro. Live-Synchro featured in Hawks &amp; Handsaws two years ago, in a column which also anticipated the debut of 'animatronic actors - humanoids, robots - who will play any role, from buffoon to sex siren, at a millifraction of the (normal) fee.' Anticipated is a bit cheeky; all I was really doing was showing that I possessed a much-thumbed copy of July 20, 2019: Life in the 21st Century, by Arthur C. Clarke, the famous science fiction writer. What no one yet knows is that these techniques, Live-Synchro and animatronics, work in reverse. I discovered this on Wednesday when summoned to 10 Downing Street for a late-night interview with John Major, the prime minister of Britain. I hurried there speedily. Soon I was enjoying, together with the prime minister, a splendid supper of bacon, eggs, sausages, tomatoes, mushrooms and baked beans. An aide had explained that I am now the only journalist Major will see, so I started off politely, biding my time. 'Economy recovering nicely, John, give or take a sixmonth?' 'Indeed it is, Michael. It is recovering really nicely, given that my administration has worked jolly hard to achieve the conditions requisite to sustainable long-term growth free of the harrowing bug-bear of rampant inflation.' 'Trade rows under control?' 'Trade rows under control.' 'Ditto Tory sex scandals?' 'Ditto Tory sex scandals.' It was time to raise the tempo. 'I am surprised, John,' I said, 'that you haven't gone screaming mad, or tried to harm yourself, given the ferocity of the criticism heaped upon you. Not this century has the leader of a democracy been vilified as you have. Yet you just keep smiling. The latest organisation to demonise you is Amnesty International, which excoriates you for selling 40 Hawk military jets to Indonesia. ''For God's sake,' says Amnesty, 'what kind of morality is it where sleeping with an actress can get a minister hounded from office, but it's OK to sell lethal weapons without legal guarantees that they won't be used to kill innocent people.' 'How do you handle that, John? How do you keep your sanity? It is almost as though' - I speared a reluctant sausage - 'you were programmed, somehow . . . as though you were an image from the middle of the next century sent to serve as a lightning conductor for all our troubles and pain.' 'Later,' said Major. 'Pardon?' '2082. It's called Reverse Live-Synchro, or RL-S. I am indeed a projection. In real life, I am a low-ranking official in the fisheries ministry of the government of Eurasia from 2082. I am Norwegian, as it happens. Married, two children. Rather good at golf. Thanks to RL-S, I have been projected backwards in time to act, as you put it, like a lightning conductor: to head off the catastrophe facing Britain - invasion by Malaysia. 'That is scheduled to happen in four years' time. I am here to stop it. The downfall of Margaret Thatcher was a technological feat engineered by our scientists. I was sent as replacement. My supreme incompetence is a clever Eurasian smokescreen. I am so incompetent that the Malaysians will take pity on us and cancel the invasion. At least, that's the hope.' 'I am flabbergasted,' I said. 'Why have you never told us that you are a synchroton sent to save us?' 'Because,' beamed the image, 'no one's ever asked.'</p>

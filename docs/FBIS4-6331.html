			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, April 19, IRNA -- Malaysian Prime  Minister Mahathir Mohamed and visiting Iranian Majlis speaker  Hojjat ol-Eslam 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri discussed Tehran-Kuala  Lumpur ties and major regional and international issues in a  meeting here Tuesday.    Nateq-Nuri underscored the need for promotion of political  and economic cooperation between the two Muslim countries. He  also condemned the UN secretary general's indifference towards  the rights of the Bosnian Muslims and suggested that Muslim  countries should mobilize their forces to defend them.    Mohamed termed as "successful" the visit to Malaysia of  Nateq-Nuri and said that such visits provide most suitable  opportunities for making decision on broadening bilateral ties.    He said that his country was interested in enhancing  relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran and that he had  issued necessary orders in this regards after he returned from a  recent official visit to Tehran.    Touching on the status quo in Bosnia-Herzegovina [B-H], he  said the UN opposed despatch of the Iranian forces to that  country under the pretext of their siding with the Bosnian  Muslims, while it allowed pro-Serb Russians to be present there.    "The UN is responsible in this connection and we condem the  UN secretary general for his action," Malaysian prime minister  said.    He called on Muslims to patch up their differences and  instead adopt a unified decision to solve the problems of the  Muslim world.    The two sides also discussed exports of the Iranian non-oil  commodities to Malaysia, and implementation of joint projects.</p>

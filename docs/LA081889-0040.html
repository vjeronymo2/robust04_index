			<p><P> August 18, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME TECH: PARENTS' CHOICE PUBLISHES GUIDE TO VIDEOCASSETTES FOR CHILDREN  </P> <P> The "Parents' Choice Guide to Videocassettes for Children" has just been  published by Consumer Reports Books. Put together by Diana Huss Green, editor  of Parents' Choice magazine, and several other authors, the $13.95 guide  reviews more than 300 videos of special interest to kids.  </P> <P> The movie "Scandal," which started a small scandal of its own over a sex scene  edited out to qualify the British sex-and-politics film for an R rating earlier  this year, will be released in both the R-rated and the original, uncut  versions by HBO Video on Oct. 25.  </P> <P> Animal lovers (lovers of animated animals, anyway) and animal haters get equal  time on Oct. 12, when Touchstone Home Video releases "Who Framed Roger Rabbit"  and Paramount Home Video releases "Pet Semetary."  </P> <P> THIS WEEK'S MOVIES  </P> <P> "The Wizard of Oz" is being re-released by MGM/UA in a "50th Anniversary"  edition this week. The price is $24.98, but a fabric-softener company is  offering $5 rebate coupons (as well as a commercial at the start of the tape)  that will bring the price down to $19.98.  </P> <P> The new videocassette version of the beloved 1939 film also includes  approximately 17 minutes of appended material. Among the extras: some Ray  Bolger dancing (as the Scarecrow, of course) cut from the film; the audio track  of the deleted "Jitterbug" number and of Buddy Ebsen (the first-hired Tin Man)  singing "If I Only Had a Heart," both illustrated by stills (and by home movies  in the case of "The Jitterbug"); a theatrical trailer for the film, and  newsreel film of Judy Garland receiving a special Oscar for her part in "Oz."  </P> <P> The tape also features an improved sound track and has been remastered,  brightening the Technicolor and restoring the sepia tone to the noncolor Kansas  segments.  </P> <P> At six hours, "Little Dorrit" was the longest major film of last year and, many  critics believed, one of the best. The G-rated Charles Dickens adaptation --  starring Alec Guinness, Derek Jacobi and several other top British actors --  comes as two two-cassette packages (titled "Nobody's Fault" and "Little  Dorrit's Story") from Warner. The price is $89.95 per package.  </P> <P> "Patty Hearst" (Media, $89.95, R) is the 1988 film directed by Paul Schrader,  telling the story of the heiress' kidnapping largely from her point of view  (Hearst is played by Natasha Richardson). "Tap" (RCA/Columbia, $89.95, PG-13)  brought together young hoofer Gregory Hines and old hoofer Sammy Davis, Jr. in  a lukewarm tale about tap dancing.  </P> <P> Connoisseur has released Shohei Imamura's black comedy "The Pornographers"  ($79.95) in letter-box format, subtitled. The company has also re-released two  Luis Bunuel classics from his Mexican period, "Los Olvidados" ($59.95) and  "Nazarin" ($69.95), plus Orson Welles' version of Kafka's "The Trial" ($39.95)  -- all three previously available from another label.  </P> <P> Other recent movies new on video: "The Wash" (Academy, $79.95, unrated), "Hit  List" (RCA/Columbia, $89.95, R) and "Under the Boardwalk" (New World, $89.95,  R).  </P> <P> Other vintage films: "Tokyo Joe," a 1949 drama that's one of Humphrey Bogart's  least-known films; "The Lady in Question," in which Rita Hayworth and Glenn  Ford made their first joint cinematic appearance (1940); "I Am the Law," a 1938  film that had Edward G. Robinson -- playing against type -- as a professor  fighting gangsters, and "Ten Wanted Men," a 1955 Randolph Scott Western.  They're $69.95 each from RCA/Columbia.  </P> <P> Price reductions: CBS/Fox has slashed the price, so to speak, on several  horror/sci-films to $19.98, including "Aliens," "The Fly" (the '86 version),  "Damien: Omen II" and "The Legend of Hell House." Even lower are "Dawn of the  Dead" and "Return of the Living Dead," now $14.99 from HBO.  </P> <P> OTHER NEW VIDEOS  </P> <P> Is it too early for Christmas videos? Family Home Entertainment doesn't think  so. Last week FHE released four Yuletide tapes (previously shown on TV) for  $14.95: "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" (the "Animagic" musical version  narrated by Burl Ives, 53 minutes), "Santa Claus Is Coming to Town" (narrated  by Fred Astaire, 53 minutes), "Little Drummer Boy" (with the voices of Greer  Garson, Jose Ferrer and the Vienna Boys Choir, 30 minutes) and "Frosty the  Snowman" (narrated by Jimmy Durante, 30 minutes).  </P> <P> "Impact Video Magazine, Volume One" (MPI, $19.95, 80 minutes) is the first in a  series of tapes that will take a "cutting-edge" look at the arts, with an  emphasis on the more daring forms of pop music. Featured in this volume: rap  group Public Enemy, L.A. rock band Jane's Addiction, the famous short film  "Bambi Meets Godzilla" and painter Robert Williams.  </P> <P> Video-game helpers: MPI has released the second volume of its "Secret Video  Game Tricks, Codes &amp; Strategies" ($14.95, 45 minutes). It focuses on  Nintendo-compatible games. So does "Video Game Guide" (Studio Video, $9.99, 40  minutes). For information on the latter tape, call (800) 541-1843. TERRY  ATKINSON  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 1, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE LEAGUE;  </P> <P> VALENCIA COACH MARRUJO UNDERPLAYS TEAM'S CHANCES, AS USUAL  </P> <P> Mike Marrujo leaned back in his chair and answered the question almost before  it was asked.  </P> <P> "We'll take them one game at a time," Marrujo said.  </P> <P> Whoa, slow down coach. You don't want to provide any bulletin board material  for opposing teams. Those brash statements and wild predictions can only get  you in trouble.  </P> <P> For the past nine years, Marrujo has coached the Valencia High School football  team with caution.  </P> <P> Marrujo never looks too far down the road and he definitely keeps his quotes  bland, especially when talking to reporters. It's safe to say that any comments  from him will be something that's safe to say.  </P> <P> However, it's getting harder and harder to find anyone, especially an Orange  League coach, who believes Marrujo's soft-sell. And you can't really blame  them.  </P> <P> Valencia has won or shared the league title for seven consecutive years. The  Tigers reached the Southern Section Division VI championship game three of the  past four seasons and won the title in 1987.  </P> <P> Things like that get noticed, especially by other coaches.  </P> <P> "You can talk all you want about who's going to win the league title, but in  the end you always have to go with Valencia," Anaheim Coach Raul Victores said.  </P> <P> Things should be no different this season. Valencia is a unanimous choice to  again win the league title, with one abstention -- Marrujo.  </P> <P> "We have some experienced players back, but we have some holes to fill too,"  Marrujo said. "I really think the only reason we're picked to win it is  tradition."  </P> <P> Well, there are a few other reasons too. Like the fact that the Tigers have won  32 of their past 35 league games or that the only league team to beat them in  the past seven years is Western.  </P> <P> Even Western Coach Jim Howell says no one -- not even the Pioneers -- will beat  Valencia this season.  </P> <P> "The rest of us will be playing for second place," Howell said.  </P> <P> Marrujo has spent nine years refining his program, one that is all substance  and no flash. The Tigers are always well-drilled, consistent and conservative,  much like their coach.  </P> <P> No player is greater than the team. If anyone thinks so, he doesn't play for  Marrujo.  </P> <P> Like many other schools, Valencia awards helmet decals for great plays.  However, decals are doled out only if the team wins.  </P> <P> Sure, there are the occasional stars. During his three years at Valencia,  running back Ray Pallares gained 5,396 yards, which was a state record until  Russell White broke it in 1988. Dorian Estes and Keef Leasure also excelled as  Tiger running backs.  </P> <P> But mostly, the Valencia players are the blue-collar variety. They go quietly  about their business and their business is winning.  </P> <P> "We get a lot of good kids here," Marrujo said. "I think that's one reason  we've been able to sustain the program."  </P> <P> The players mirror their coach, talking in generalities and cliches, always  careful not to offend. Their practices are workmanlike, almost serene. No chest  pounding or finger pointing.  </P> <P> Marrujo doesn't even like it when the Tiger fans become too boisterous.  </P> <P> Last season, Valencia was leading Western, 15-7, with less than two minutes  left. The Pioneers had the ball inside their 10-yard line and had no timeouts.  </P> <P> The Valencia crowd began chanting, "Na-na-na-na, hey-hey-hey, goodby." Marrujo  turned to an assistant coach and said., "Great, that's just what we need. Now  they'll drive 90 yards and tie the game."  </P> <P> Bottom line: Just win, baby . . . anonymously.  </P> <P> However, success brings attention and few schools were more successful in the  '80s. In fact, Valencia won more league championships than any other Orange  County team during the decade.  </P> <P> "They are always a well-coached team," Savanna Coach Fred DiPalma said. "Mike  does a really good job at keeping the kids' minds on the game. And once you get  a winning tradition, you get more kids out for the team and the winning becomes  easier."  </P> <P> Before Marrujo was hired in 1981, Valencia had little winning tradition.  </P> <P> In 1980, the Tigers finished third in the Orange League and qualified for the  playoffs. However, before that season they had lost 30 consecutive games.  </P> <P> "At the time, they were happy with just being a third-place team and getting  into the playoffs," Marrujo said.  </P> <P> Marrujo has experience with reviving programs. In 1977, he was hired at Pius X,  which had been the doormat of the tough Angelus League.  </P> <P> In the four years under Marrujo, the Warriors were 21-17-1.  </P> <P> "That may not sound like much, but remember that was the Angelus League,"  Marrujo said. "We had to play teams like St. Paul, Bishop Amat, Mater Dei and  Servite."  </P> <P> Valencia qualified for the playoffs the first two seasons under Marrujo and, in  1983, the Tigers won their first league title. No one has been able to unseat  them since.  </P> <P> "They got it rolling over there," Howell said. "Mike has developed the lower  programs and the kids develop. By the time they get to the varsity, they are  ready to go."  </P> <P> Whether this 1990 Valencia team is ready to go is open for debate, at least by  Marrujo.  </P> <P> "We'll be lucky to win two games," Marrujo said. Then he smiled.  </P> <P> At times, even he has trouble buying that Mike Marrujo soft-sell.  </P> <P> </P> <P> PREP FOOTBALL '90: THE ORANGE LEAGUE  </P> <P> </P> <P> DIVISION VI  </P> <P> Anaheim  </P> <P> Coach: Raul Victores (second year)  </P> <P> 1989 record: 4-6, 2-3  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: 25  </P> <P> Returning starters: Six offense, seven defense  </P> <P> Top returnees: Chad Campbell, QB, 6-3, 178, Sr.; Carlos Flores, LB, 6-0, 215,  Sr.; Say Iemsisanith, RB/LB, 5-9, 160, Sr.; Robert Jones, RB, 5-9, 200, Sr.;  Ismael Lopez, DG, 5-10, 215, Sr.; James Parson DT, 6-3, 220, Sr.; Robert Serna,  OG, 5-9, 180, Sr.  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Giulian Buzila, DB/WR, 5-11, 170, So.; Phil Covarruvias, QB,  5-10, 147; Brian Diaz, RB/DB 5-8, 175, So.  </P> <P> Outlook: The Colonists will be strong on the defensive front, where they return  two linemen and two linebackers. Lopez was a first-team all-league selection  last season. Jones could be a quality runner. He gained more than 400 yards  last season, splitting time at running back and quarterback. Jones will play  only running back this season, which was his position as a sophomore and  freshman. Campbell and Covarruvias will compete at quarterback, but neither has  much experience. The offensive line has good size, but lacks experience. Serna  is the only returning starter. The Colonists have good depth with 65 players on  the roster, 35 of who are seniors.  </P> <P> Brea-Olinda  </P> <P> Coach: Jon Looney (third year)  </P> <P> 1989 record: 9-3, 3-2  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: 15  </P> <P> Returning starters: Five on offense, four on defense  </P> <P> Top returnees: Jason Beam, OG, 5-11, 200; Mike Buonuaro, DB, 5-11, 175, Sr.;  Brook Coop, FB, 5-10, 180, Sr.; Lance Gasporra, LB, 5-11, 180, Sr.; Marco  Hernandez, LB, 5-10, 175, Jr.; Rob Logoteta, LB, 5-5, 160, Sr.; Lou Morales,  TB, 5-9, 160, Sr.; Bernie Rivas, OT, 6-0, 210, Sr.; Mike Ryan, FS, 6-2, 180,  Sr.; Ben Segura, OG, 6-1, 205, Sr. Sean Tracey, OT, 6-0, 200, Sr.  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Gary Duncan, DT, 6-2, 230, Sr.; Mike Feine, DB, 5-10, 165, Jr.;  Nick Logoteta, WR, 5-11, 146, So.; John Luevanos, QB, 5-10, 175, Jr.; Todd  Parrack, DT, 6-4, 225, Jr.  </P> <P> Outlook: The Wildcats lost nine three-year starters from the 1989 team that  reached the second round of the Division VI playoffs. The most glaring loss was  quarterback Chad Marlow, who passed for more than 1,400 yards last season. The  defense is led by Ryan and Gasporra; both were first-team all-league selections  in 1989. Morales moves from defensive back to tailback. He'll have plenty of  support from an offensive line that returns three starters.  </P> <P> Magnolia  </P> <P> Coach: Bill Friedrich  </P> <P> 1989 record: 1-9, 1-4  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: 17  </P> <P> Returning starters: One on offense, six on defense  </P> <P> Top returnees: Josh Acosta, QB, 6-0, 170, Sr.; Ariel Courvetier, TB, 6-2, 195,  Sr.; Don Darby, FB, 5-10, 175, Sr.; Andy DiMarco, DT, 5-10, 195, Sr.; John  Garcia, DB, 5-9, 165, Sr.; Chad Irwin, LB, 6-2, 195, Sr.; Jernique Mitchell,  DT, 5-11, 220, Sr.; Grantt Rowan, LB, 6-3, 215, Sr.; Norm Tuazon, DB, 5-6, 145,  Sr.  </P> <P> Top newcomers: J.R. Garrett, WR, 5-10, 160, Jr.; Doug Isaacs, QB, 6-0, 170,  Jr.; A.J. McCowan, QB, 5-8, 155, Sr.; Anthony Requejo, OL, 6-2, 290, Jr.; Randy  Sparks, OL, 6-2, 270, Sr.  </P> <P> Outlook: The Sentinels have good size on the offensive line and some experience  on defense. However, there are many question marks at the skill positions,  especially at quarterback where Acosta, Isaacs and McCowan are competing for  the starting spot. Courvetier was the anchor on the Magnolia 440 relay team  last spring. Friedrich is the team's third head coach in as many years. He was  the head coach at Millikan High School last season and before that was the  coach at St. John Bosco for 12 years.  </P> <P> Savanna  </P> <P> Coach: Fred DiPalma (second year)  </P> <P> 1989 record: 0-10, 0-5 (Savanna forfeited six victories and a tie because of an  ineligible player)  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: 18  </P> <P> Returning starters: Four on offense, four on defense  </P> <P> Top returnees: Brook Bell, LB/RB, 5-10, 175, Sr.; Vince Flores, WR/DB, 6-1,  165, Sr.; Marty Garcia, OT, 6-2, 275; Leon Landry RB/DB, 6-1, 170, Sr.; Joe  Nava, OL/DL, 210, Sr.; Hien Nguyen, DB/WR, 5-9, 160, Sr.; Hoan Nguyen, DB/WR,  6-2, 170.  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Brad Belanger, QB/DB, 5-7, 150, Jr.; Glenn Grabhorn, OL/DL, 5-9,  175, Sr.; Hieu Nguyen, RB/DB, 5-7, 155, Jr.  </P> <P> Outlook: The Rebels were league co-champions with Valencia last season, but had  to forfeit the title because of an ineligible player. "I think the kids have  been very positive about what happened," DiPalma said. "And they are very  determined." Whether that will mean continued success depends on how well the  Rebels fill the holes. Landry, a starting defensive back last season, has the  toughest assignment as he moves to running back to replace Kenison PoChing (900  yards). The secondary is sound with Hien and Hoan Nguyen, who are brothers, and  Hieu Nguyen, who is not related.  </P> <P> Western  </P> <P> Coach: Jim Howell (12th year)  </P> <P> 1989 record: 8-3, 4-1  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: 19  </P> <P> Returning starters: Three on offense, one on defense  </P> <P> Top returnees: Gil Brito, QB, 5-10, 185, Sr.; Francel Esquivel, C/LB, 5-7, 175,  Sr.; Shane Foss, FB, 5-10, 185, Sr.; Mike Hikes, LB, 5-11, 175, Sr.; Jesse  McReynolds, OT, 6-2, 210, Sr.; Al Quinto, LB, 5-10, 190, Sr.; John Roady, OT,  6-4, 230, Sr.; Derrick Taylor, TE/DE, 6-1, 200, Sr.; Jason Vaughn, TE, 5-11,  170, Sr.; Alfredo Villages, LB/WB, 5-6, 160, Jr.; John Walder, RB/DB, 5-7, 145,  Sr.  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Jeff Bates, OG, 5-10, 190, So.; Jason Christensen, WR/DB, 5-10,  150, Jr.  </P> <P> Outlook: The Pioneers always have a big offensive line, but this season their  strength should be at the skill positions. Brito has been a starter since his  sophomore season and is dangerous on the field because of his quickness. He  passed for more than 1,000 yards and rushed for more than 500 yards in 1989.  Foss was a first-team all-league selection last season. The offensive line is  much smaller than in previous seasons, but Roady and McReynolds give it  experience. The Pioneers also have a good corps of linebackers, but overall,  they lack experience on the defensive side.  </P> <P> Valencia  </P> <P> Coach: Mike Marrujo (10th season)  </P> <P> 1989 record: 10-1, 5-0  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: 23  </P> <P> Returning starters: Four on offense, three on defense  </P> <P> Top returnees: Kevin Alexander, DB/WR, 5-9, 160, Jr.; Korey Alexander, DB/WR,  5-9, 160, Jr.; Sorin Cabuta, DT/OT, 6-1, 215, Sr.; Mike Ehli, LB, 6-1, 195;  John Fewell, RB/DE, 5-10, 175, Sr. Dave Fenstermaker, C, 5-10, 180, Sr.; Ken  Lee, LB, 6-0, 200, Sr.; Mark O'Brien, 6-2, 185, Jr., Jr.; Ryan Roskelly, 5-10,  170, Jr.; Dave Wallace, DT, 5-11, 208, Sr.; Josiah Williams, WR, 6-0, 165, Sr.;  Scott Williams, DT/G, 6-1, 215, Sr.  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Raul Padilla, DE/RB, Sr.  </P> <P> Outlook: The Tigers are favored to win the league championship. Although they  have only seven starters returning, they are an experienced squad. Most of this  year's starters played last season. As always, the running game will be strong.  Roskelly gained 750 yards rushing last season and Fewell gained 513. The  defense is led by Ehli, who has been a starter since the 1988 playoffs. O'Brien  will be the first junior to start at quarterback for Valencia since Ron Kreiger  in 1982. O'Brien played little last season, but has a strong arm, according to  Marrujo.  </P></p>

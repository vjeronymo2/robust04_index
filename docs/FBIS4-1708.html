			<p>BFN     [Text] Provincial Party Committee Secretary Liu Fangren  recently inspected Liupanshui City where he emphatically called  for further emancipating the mind, bracing up, and vigorously  speeding up economic growth.    On 14-16 March, Liu Fangren and his entourage inspected  Shuicheng Iron and Steel Company, Shuicheng County's Waga  Village, Liupanshui City's Zhongshan Development Zone, Liuzhi  Special Economic Zone's township and town enterprises,  Zhenjiazhai Cement Factory, as well as some other units where he  listened to reports given by the Liupanshui City leaders. He  fully affirmed the Liupanshui City's achievements over the past  few years, saying: In 1993, Liupanshui City successfully  increased gross national product by over 13 percent, higher than  the province's average, and increased financial revenue by more  than 50 percent, giving it the province's highest rate of  increase.    On behalf of the provincial people's government, Secretary  Liu Fangren expressed appreciation and thanks to the broad  masses of cadres and people in Liupanshui City. While  inspecting Liupanshui City, Liu pointed out: At the moment, we  should make continued efforts to emancipate the mind and brace  ourselves. Only by furthering ideological emancipation will it  be possible to deepen reform. Ideological emancipation is the  precursor of economic development. Without ideological  emancipation, it would be impossible to quicken the pace of  reform, opening up, and economic development and seize  opportunities. We should make both vertical and horizontal  comparisons to find shortcomings, update concepts, and speed up  economic growth.    Secretary Li Fangren stressed: Now that the CPC Central  Committee and the Guizhou Provincial CPC Committee have  formulated a clear-cut train of thought and a series of feasible  measures, we should waste no time in carrying out this train of  thought as well as the relevant measures and work in a creative  manner.    Secretary Liu Fangren also called on cadres at all levels  across the province to transform work style in a down-to-earth  manner, go to the grassroots level to carry out investigation  and study, adhere to the principle of firmly grasping two key  aspects of work simultaneously, and make a success of all types  of work.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The government is satisfied with the NATO summit's  decision on expanding the Alliance.    Briefing correspondents today, government spokesman Ioannis  Kasoulidhis said Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou very  correctly noted that the decision to include former Warsaw Pact  and CSCE countries in the plan for cooperation on peace gives  Cyprus the right to cooperate with NATO if it wants. Asked  whether the government intends to express such an interest,  Kasoulidhis replied that Cyprus is happy to have the right, but  added that it does not intend to use it now.    Kasoulidhis said Papandreou did not raise the Cyprus issue  at  the NATO summit because he was there representing the European  Union, not the Greek Government. The spokesman added that  Papandreou planned to raise the Cyprus ssue during a luncheon  for the NATO leaders.</p>

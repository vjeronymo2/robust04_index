			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / As They Say in Europe: Jackboot reaction - Germany's image abroad THE FACT that Germany's most august organ of conservative opinion is now concerned deeply about the practice of setting fire to foreigners shows things are getting out of hand. The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung wrote the other day: 'The terrorism of the right has now reached the niveau of that of the left.' This statement was justified by arguing that the right was now selecting targets in cold blood, rather than killing people accidentally in the course of some other, presumably more innocent, endeavour, such as random fire-bombing. Generally, though, the latest events have led to more introspection than ever. Everybody who is anybody is called in to diagnose the latest version of that popular game show, What's Wrong with Germany. In the Welt am Sonntag, Dr Gertrud Hohler said: 'We Germans seem helplessly chained to that fatal mixture of self-admiration and self-contempt.' Hohler is a kind of renaissance woman - a professor of literature, a management consultant and a member of the board of Grand Metropolitan. Although she provided one of those interminable angst-ridden bits of self-analysis in which the Germans specialise, she also has a way with words. As she sees it, world opinion will deal with the Germans - 'a people which cannot get used to showing its strength and cannot combat its weaknesses without false sentimentality'. She noted that if you cannot deal with things, you will be dealt with. Papers run a country-by-country review of Germany's image abroad today. One had to get to Japan before finding a place where little or no harm had been done. To the Germans, there is not much virtue in that: they show a certain ambivalence in how they are viewed by the Japanese - 'the two countries which started the war and lost it'. Sometimes, the Germans influence others by the way they observe themselves. The Frankfurter Allgemeine ran a headline after the deaths of the Turks at Molln - 'One taboo less' - which became the title for a similar editorial in NRC-Handelsblad of Rotterdam. That paper concluded by wondering, as do all of Germany's neighbours, how German society was going to react to what the FAZ had called 'the removal of the taboo on national socialist ideology'. It is difficult to know where the real responsibility for the removal of this taboo lies. I have, reluctantly, come to the view that is the best people in Germany who may have played a role. Unlike, say, a quarter of a century ago, the media maintains an exacting schedule of comment on every conceivable aspect of the Third Reich. There is hardly a book review section that does not mention a new tome about a hidden corner of German society in the '30s and '40s. Towns, large and small, open museums dedicated to that period. The most recent was in Dortmund where the full horrors of the Gestapo and the Holocaust, as they applied to that city, are revealed. Even the 'beating up chamber' was restored to working order. That, in turn, occasions lengthy analysis in the papers. This steady flow of information has led to some kind of normalisation of the Nazis. Where the 'ghosts of the past' are on everyday view, they cease to be so spooky. The Germans have, conscientiously, presented the 'banality of evil' (in Hanna Arendt's phrase) and thereby put it at the disposal of the most banal sections of the population: dreary young men who, normally, would be planning a drunken spree or a bit of car stealing. Those same young men now fantasise about stepping into the jackboots of their nastier grandfathers. In Germany, those museums in Dortmund and elsewhere name those grandfathers; in Britain, the yobs have no such figures to emulate. It was notable that when the secret files on the occupation of the Channel Islands were released this week, nearly 50 years late (or 50 years early, according to British rules), the names of collaborators were erased to protect the guilty. It is always worse if it happens in Germany. In France, a boulangere in Reims shot dead a young Moroccan who, with his friends, got involved in a row with the woman's uncle, who was running the bakery, over stolen croissants. The National Front supported the plea of legitimate defence and she was acquitted of everything two weeks ago. I imagine that this is the first time you have read about this story, unless you live in France. But if it had happened in Germany. . .

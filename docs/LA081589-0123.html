			<p><P> August 15, 1989, Tuesday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> SEPULVEDA TUNNEL TO BE CLOSED  </P> <P> The Sepulveda Boulevard Tunnel under Mulholland Drive will be shut down from  Aug. 19 to Sept. 30 so that the roadway can be reconstructed, two Los Angeles  city councilmen announced today.  </P> <P> Councilmen Zev Yaroslavsky and Marvin Braude said the closure is expected to  cause additional congestion on the San Diego Freeway and other highways linking  the San Fernando Valley with Los Angeles.  </P> <P> California Department of Transportation officials said the roadway must be  lowered. They said past resurfacing has raised the street to a point that tall  vehicles have begun to scrape the tunnel.  </P> <P> The officials said complete closure of Sepulveda between Rimerton Road and  Royal Hills Drive is needed to ensure public safety.  </P></p>

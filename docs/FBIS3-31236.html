			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Jahorina, 15 Feb (TANJUG) -- The Serb side is ready  to move some of its weapons to enable more efficient control,  Radovan Karadzic, president of the Srpska republic said at  Jahorina [near Sarajevo] today.    At a very well attended news conference, Karadzic said that  the decision on whether NATO will bomb us or not does not depend  on the Serb side.    By tomorrow we will issue an official statement regarding  the  NATO ultimatum. We are not an internationally recognized state  and therefore an ultimatum in such a form cannot be issued to  us, Karadzic said, adding that such moves were unnecessary and  reminded him of knocking on an open door.    To explain this assertion, he recalled that on 7 February  all  details of the demilitarization of Sarajevo had been agreed with  Yasushi Akashi.    We are satisfied with the UN mission and its unbiased  position and we fully cooperate with their representatives in  order to reduce tension, but we are not satisfied with the NATO  position, for their decisions are completely anti-Serb, Karadzic  said, and stressed that he subsequently welcomed the additional  explanations by the United States and Russia that the ultimatum  referred to all the warring sides, and not only to the Serbs.    We are a small people who are fighting for their freedom and  rights, something to which other people are entitled. If NATO  exists only to threaten small peoples, then its' member  countries ought to ask themselves what they spend so much money  on, Karadzic said, emphasizing the Serbian people's gratitude to  Russia. We must, however, rely on our own forces while  believing that there is commonsense in one part of the  international community.    In reply to questions that referred to the withdrawal of  Serb  artillery around Sarajevo, Karadzic stressed the Serb side's  willingness to move some of the weaponry in order to facilitate  more effective UN control, since the UNPROFOR [UN Protection  Forces] lacks staff who can effectively control all the armed  positions.    We are going to group some of the weaponry to enable  observers to take control more easily, something that should  lead to the further restoration of peace in Sarajevo and that  could set a precedent for other areas in ex-Bosnia-Herzegovina.  Peace does not suit the Muslim side, though. Their true  intentions will soon be revealed, Karadzic cautions.    Both the United Nations and the Serb side want a lasting  peace in Sarajevo, which is not a besieged city but a city split  into a Serb and a Muslim part, a situation that will remain  pending a final political settlement, Karadzic said. By no  means are we going to provoke NATO, as we know to what extent  some circles in the West are interested in continuing the  bloodshed, because their ultimate aim is to demonstrate force to  Russia by punishing the Serbs, Radovan Karadzic, president of  the Srpska republic said at today's news conference.</p>

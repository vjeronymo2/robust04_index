			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / The Long View: Doomsters' delight When the stock market tumbles a long way on a marginally disappointing economic statistic, as it did on Wednesday afternoon following the inflation figures, there must be a serious underlying malaise. Last August, a fictitious guest contributor to this column called Dr Mort Duhm set out a scenario in which the global bull market, based upon unlimited and cheap (3 per cent) credit from the US Federal Reserve, would unravel. 'Within the next few months, I anticipate a meltdown in which the Fed will turn down the tap, hot money will panic out of bonds, and stock prices will become value-based and not liquidity-driven,' he said. Since the end of January, this sequence of events has indeed been unfolding. This week, the Fed added the second quarter-point to short-term dollar rates and there is no logical stopping place until we get to the 4 1/2 -5 per cent range, at least. Long-dated bond yields have surged everywhere and, in the US, Japan and the UK, are more than a percentage point above last year's lows. We have seen repeated waves of so-called stop-loss selling as bonds have been dumped at ever-lower prices. We may soon have to call this a bond market crash. The vulnerability of the equity markets has varied, however. We can deduce that the speculative hedge funds took aggressive positions in emerging markets and in certain European markets (especially the UK, 12 per cent off its peak) but not in the US or Japan. There are real Dr Duhms that I know about in the US, Germany and Hong Kong. His closest equivalent in London is Stephen Wheeler, of broker Greig Middleton. He says financial markets have seemed to have huge liquidity but actually will be shown to be hugely illiquid. New figures for the UK investment institutions shed some light on how the global surge in liquidity affected the domestic markets in 1993. At the beginning of the year, there were worries about how investors would be able to cope with the demands being made upon them, especially by the government  -which, in the event, sold Pounds 52bn of gilts, net of redemptions, in 1993 compared with Pounds 28bn the year before. Yet, the huge volume of paper was actually absorbed very easily in 1993. First, there was a surge of money into unit trusts, investment trusts and the roughly equivalent lump sum products of life assurance companies. This happened largely because the fall in short-term interest rates made savings deposits less attractive. In the fourth quarter, the inflows into these institutions, at Pounds 11.6bn, were 86 per cent higher than in the same period of 1992. Second, overseas investors were active on an unprecedented scale in the gilt market, buying Pounds 14bn worth in 1993 compared with just Pounds 2.3bn in 1992. Domestic institutions actually slightly reduced their gilt purchases and, instead, went on a spending spree in equities, buying Pounds 17bn of shares in the UK and Pounds 10bn overseas. You do not have to be a Dr Duhm to ask what will happen now if the distressed foreigners stop buying - or, worse, turn sellers (they sold Pounds 4bn of gilts in 1990, for instance) and create a black hole of, say, Pounds 20bn in the flow of funds equations. Fortunately, the British government might not need to sell more than about Pounds 35bn of gilts this year. And the Bank of England is preparing already for the change of conditions by switching its attention to the banks, which next week will be offered Pounds 2.5bn of floating rate gilts. But patching over the new-issue gap will not be a complete answer. This year, the long-term sterling interest rate will be set primarily by domestic investors, not by foreign hedge funds. There will also be consequences for the short-term rates. Britain's balance of payments' deficit of Pounds 10.7bn was, in effect, financed in 1993 by foreign bond-buyers, but it is likely that short-term hot money will need to be attracted instead this year, perhaps by higher money market interest rates. The international background could turn difficult. Warburg Securities has calculated that American banks and individuals have invested Dollars 650bn in dollar bonds since 1990. They look fully committed now. There have also been substantial investments in European bonds. Although UK government borrowing is beginning to fall, this is not true for European countries generally. Wheeler argues that the 1993 bond market boom was a bank-financed bubble, much on the lines of the late 1980s property boom. Commercial property yields in the UK fell to about 5.5 per cent in 1989, but soared to 8 per cent by 1992 as the market crashed. More recently, yields have declined again as the overhang of unsold and bankrupt property has been mopped up gradually by long-term investors. In the bond market, events could be expected to move much faster because paper can be shuffled much more quickly than office blocks. In both cases, the transition would be from a situation in which the market was dominated by buyers seeking short-term capital gains, to one in which long-term income-seekers set the level. They would find the money by selling other assets, such as equities. What might long-term UK interest rates rise to? Pension funds are the largest group of UK institutions. Out of their roughly Pounds 450bn of assets, only about Pounds 13bn at present are fixed-interest gilts. Pension schemes need a rate of return of 4 or 5 per cent over prices to meet their long-term objectives. At present, the inflation rate implied by the gap between index-linked and fixed-interest yields is more than 4 per cent. So, fund managers might be looking for 8 1/2 to 9 per cent yields. But other buyers, such as insurance companies, may settle for a bit less, depending on the inflation outlook. Already, long gilt yields are close to 8 per cent. They are likely to overshoot, then bounce back. In these conditions, the market can become hazardous. Dr Duhm could be quietly enjoying himself, though.</p>

Xiao Rong, an NPC deputy of the PLA, who had just hurried  back home from Japan after participating in a ceremony for the  first publication of the Japanese edition of the book My  Father, Deng Xiaoping, made the above remarks in an  interview with these staff reporters at the plenary session of  the NPC delegation of the PLA today.    The reporters asked: "What is Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  current health?" Xiao Rong said: "He is very health now. Of  course, at his old age, he is not like he used to be. But for a  90-year-old man, his health is not bad. He reads a dozen or so  papers daily and he watches news bulletins on television. Like  other NPC deputies, he also reads some documents about the  current NPC session.    The reporters asked Xiao Rong whether Comrade Xiaoping also  reads JIEFANGJUN BAO daily, and she said without hesitation:  "Of course, JIEFANGJUN BAO is an important paper. My father  has to read it every day because he is a veteran serviceman.  From the Red Army to the Eighth Route Army to the PLA, and  finally acting as the chairman of the Central Military  Commission, he has always been very concerned about army  building. Although he is retired now, he likes to read  JIEFANGJUN BAO as he used to."    Xiao Rong also answered this question: "Why has Comrade  Xiaoping spent the Spring Festival in Shanghai over the past  seven years?" Xiao Rong said: "My father likes Shanghai. He  attaches special importance to Shanghai's important position in  China's reform and opening up and economic development. He  thinks Shanghai's role cannot be replaced by any other place.  During my father's stay in Shanghai over the last Spring  Festival, he witnessed its huge changes and happily commented:  `It's really good!' He had never said this before."    Then Xiao Rong smilingly recalled and said: When my father  saw the newly built Yanggao road in Pudong he was very cheerful  and composed an "impromptu poem:" "Seeing the road today is  better than reading for one hundred years." At that time, I  said: You've never composed a poem before, why have you come up  with one today? My father said seriously: "These words are  from my heart." As he said this, everyone on the spot laughed  including Shanghai Municipal Party Secretary Wu Bangguo and  Mayor Huang Ju.    Finally, the reporters asked: "When will the second volume  of My Father, Deng Xiaoping, (whose author is Mao  Mao, that is, Xiao Rong) which has long been expected by  readers, be published?" Xiao Rong disclosed: "I am now making  preparations to write the book."</p>

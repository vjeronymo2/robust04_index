			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Sale of Charter house expected this week ROYAL Bank of Scotland is expected to announce the long-awaited sale of Charterhouse, its merchant banking subsidiary, to two European banks this week. Berliner Handels- und Frankfurter Bank of Germany and Credit Commercial de France will each take a 45 per cent stake in Charterhouse, with Royal Bank of Scotland retaining the remaining 10 per cent. The price of Pounds 235m - which is currently being mentioned - for the 90 per cent stake that Royal Bank of Scotland is selling is higher than originally expected. The deal will be the first time a UK merchant bank has been bought by a Franco-German banking partnership. CCF and BHF have their own investment banking operations and want to build a pan-European merchant banking business around Charterhouse. Negotiations have dragged on for several months. Analysts had expected Charterhouse to be sold for around Pounds 200m, but Royal Bank of Scotland, which is being advised by the merchant bank S. G. Warburg, is understood to have held out for an improved offer price. The deal is intended to give Charterhouse access to the French and German banks' customers in continental Europe and in the UK. Royal Bank of Scotland wanted to concentrate on its retail business and felt that owning a merchant bank was not 'synergistic' with its clearing bank operations.</p>

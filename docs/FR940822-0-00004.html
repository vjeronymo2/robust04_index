This action requires replacement of certain circuit breakers for the toilet system vacuum generator. This amendment is prompted by reports of excessive vacuum generator overloads or blocked rotor conditions, in which the thermal protection device and/or related aircraft circuit breakers do not interrupt the power supply. The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent a fire in the event of excessive current in the electrical circuit due to overheating of the vacuum generator.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Effective on September 6, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of September 6, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments for inclusion in the Rules Docket must be received on or before October 21, 1994.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;105&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Airbus Industrie, 1 Rond Point Maurice Bellonte, 31707 Blagnac Cedex, France.

The DGAC has advised that it has received reports of electrical overloads in the toilet system vacuum generator or blocked rotors, in which the temperature of the vacuum generator motor increases faster than the detection capability of the thermal protection device and/or the related aircraft circuit breaker. In each case, these devices failed to interrupt the power supply. This condition, if not corrected, could cause the vacuum generator to overheat, which could result in a fire. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Airbus has issued All Operator Telex (AOT) 38&hyph;01, dated December 15, 1993, and Service Bulletin A340&hyph;38&hyph;4013, dated January 5, 1994, which describe procedures for replacement of two circuit breakers for the vacuum generator. Existing circuit breakers, 6 MG and 106 MG, are replaced with faster (20 amp) circuit breakers to provide additional protection in the event of excessive current in the electrical circuit or overheat in the vacuum generator. The DGAC classified the AOT and service bulletin as mandatory and issued French Airworthiness Directive, 94&hyph;006&hyph;004(B)R1, dated February 2, 1994, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in France. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This airplane model is manufactured in France and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the DGAC has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the DGAC, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, this AD is being issued to prevent a fire in the vacuum generator. This AD requires replacement of two circuit breakers for the vacuum generator with faster type circuit breakers which will improve detection capability of the thermal protection device. The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the AOT or service bulletin described previously. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There currently are no Model A340&hyph;211 or &hyph;311 series airplanes on the U.S. Register. All airplanes included in the applicability of this rule currently are operated by non-U.S. operators under foreign registry; therefore, they are not directly affected by this AD action. However, the FAA considers that this rule is necessary to ensure that the unsafe condition is addressed in the event that any of these subject airplanes are imported and placed on the U.S. Register in the future. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Should an affected airplane be imported and placed on the U.S. Register in the future, it would require approximately 7 work hours to accomplish the required actions, at an average labor charge of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of this AD would be $385 per airplane. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since this AD action does not affect any airplane that is currently on the U.S. register, it has no adverse economic impact and imposes no additional burden on any person. Therefore, notice and public procedures hereon are unnecessary and the amendment may be made effective in less than 30 days after publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Gornostayev: "It Will Be an Extremely </F> Long Time Before Security Council Candidates Become Permanent  Members"]    [Text] The first session of the open work group on the  question of fair representation in the Security Council and  expansion of its membership will begin at the UN headquarters in  New York today.    This problem is bothering mainly Germany and Japan, which  are  eager to join the Security Council. It is above all a matter of  prestige for them: These leading industrial powers, which have  an immense economic and military potential, set the tone for the  G-7, and have the status of leaders in Europe and Asia, are  restricted politically because they do not have permanent  membership on the Security Council.    The solution to the problem is important to the FRG also  because now Bonn cannot directly affect the policy of the  international community, above all regarding the Bosnian  conflict, which has flared up right at Germany's side.    There is still the opinion that neither Germany nor Japan  can  be allowed on the UN Security Council, recalling the atrocities  committed by these countries' armies during World War II. As for  Japan, many of its neighbors in the region are torn by conflicts  about its joining the "Big Five." Thus, for example, South Korea  thinks that China's representation on the Security Council is  clearly inadequate for such an immense continent as Asia.  Therefore allowing the country of the Rising Sun onto the  Security Council would be a benefit for Asians. On the other  hand, this official position from Seoul is countered by the  opinion of a considerable portion of South Korean society: In no  case should Japan be allowed to solve problems related to world  security. As NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA has already written, before  Morihiro Hosokawa's speech at the 48th Session of the UN General  Assembly in New York the South Koreans held a demonstration  protesting Japan's admission to the Security Council. One of the  demands was compensation and apologies to the victims of  aggression on the Korean peninsula during World War II. Hosokawa  made an apology.    Germany too softened its position and began to court the  world community for a leadership chair: Its second petition was  worded much less ambitiously than the first one. True, the head  of the foreign political department of the FRG, Klaus Kinkel,  stipulated at the UN General assembly that it was not yet  completely clear whether Germany would be able to play a more  active role by assigning its troops for UN peacemaking  operations.    This question could become a stumbling block for Bonn.  Because U.S. President Bill Clinton placed emphasis precisely on  the more active participation of possible Security Council  candidates in the peacemaking operations themselves and also in  the financing of these and also UN structures. Although in  response to UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali the White House  actually officially announced its support for the idea of the  entry of the FRG and Japan into the Security Council. But it  seems that the Americans need most of all to shift part of their  burden onto the shoulders of Tokyo and Bonn. Having lost several  dozen of their soldiers in Somalia and millions of dollars in  the former Yugoslavia, and having the largest quota for payments  into the UN budget, the United States, naturally, wants someone  to share its burden.    China's position is somewhat more restrained: In principle  Beijing has nothing against accepting new members, but not in  the foreseeable future. Great Britain, England, [as published]  and Russia are of the same opinion.    As a NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent was told in the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, as of  today Moscow sees its basic task as maintaining the  effectiveness and efficiency which the UN Security Council has  achieved in recent years. It is thought on Smolensk Street that  any steps to expand it should be taken in stages. So this  question will be decided, as the Russian diplomat stated, "not  today or even tomorrow." To decide it, naturally, will take a  consensus of the Big Five. Moreover, the report of the work  group will not be submitted for consideration to the 49th  session of the UN General Assembly until September.</p>

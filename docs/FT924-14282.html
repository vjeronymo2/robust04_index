			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Major aims for 'lasting recovery' A RENEWED commitment to providing low inflation and low taxation to make the British economy strong came yesterday as Mr John Major insisted that his government would not betray the trust placed in it at the election. In a bleak passage, he acknowledged the personal hardship that many people were facing during the recession with the loss of their jobs, businesses or homes, and the frustration at how slowly the economy was recovering even though there were some signs of improvement. That was why the government was determined to find a way of bringing about sustainable prosperity. 'I don't want a temporary cure, I want a lasting recovery,' the prime minister said. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, was singled out to be thanked for his 'courage' in bringing inflation down. The government's specific promise on inflation was restated in the phrase: 'We must keep it down at the point where it no longer interferes with the decisions that people and businesses have to make in their daily lives.' The prime minister brushed aside the difficulties of sterling's suspension from the exchange rate mechanism, which was mentioned just once in his 59-minute speech, with the comment that last month the mechanism 'was no longer the servant of Europe's prosperity'. Instead, he concentrated on the way in which low inflation, together with the lower exchange rate, provided a great opportunity for British business and exports. He underlined the government's pledge on keeping to its public-spending targets and on having low taxes, not just for individuals but for companies: 'Those who build up new businesses must be confident they won't be stifled by taxation'. While there were regular bursts of applause in the economic passages in Mr Major's speech, the intense emotional audience reaction was reserved for other subjects - particularly the outpouring of feeling provoked by his commitment never to 'let our distinctive British identity be lost in a federal Europe'. By contrast, the representatives listened silently and attentively to much of Mr Major's argument that Britain could not 'pull up the drawbridge and live in our own private yesterday', and the clapping then was polite rather than heartfelt. There was even some hissing when Mr Major mentioned Maastricht. The speech was remarkable for its absence of attacks on Labour and the Liberal Democrats to rouse the Tory faithful, but after a week that has exposed deep Conservative divisions, Mr Major still played some populist notes that saw his party united on traditional areas closest to its heart. His comments on new rights against unlawful strikes in the public services; on cracking down on crime; on action to deal with 'new age' travellers - 'If 'doing your own thing' means exploiting the social security system and sponging off others, then I don't want to understand' - and a commitment to 'old-fashioned' school standards and teaching methods all produced loud appreciation. Representatives roared approval when he said that the plans to set up 'education associations' to run inner-city schools if local councils failed would mean a further row with the educational establishment. 'I look forward to that,' he told them. 'It's a row worth having.'</p>

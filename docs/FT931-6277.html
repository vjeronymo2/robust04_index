			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / International Company News: Rail job cuts push CN to heavy loss CANADIAN National Railways, the government-owned railway company, expects to report 1992 losses of over CDollars 1bn (USDollars 800m), largely reflecting the cost of severance packages for about 11,000 workers. The previously-announced job cuts, which will cut CN's workforce by a third, are due to be implemented over the next three years. But Mr Paul Tellier, who recently took over as CN president, said the entire CDollars 900m cost would be taken in the 1992 accounts. The company expects to pay workers an average of CDollars 80,000 each to entice them to give up contractual job security. Both Canada's national rail companies, CN and Canadian Pacific, are in the throes of far-reaching retrenchment in an effort to improve their competitiveness against US railways and truck operators. CP Rail has reported a 1992 loss of CDollars 343m, most due to restructuring charges, including the cost of reducing the size of train crews. Mr Tellier predicted that CN would suffer a loss of about CDollars 70m for 1993 but would return to the black in 1994. Besides the job cuts, CN and CP are anxious to accelerate rail network rationalisation. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce is to restructure its operations in the Caribbean, Reuter reports from Toronto. Under the first stage of the plan, which is still subject to regulatory approval, the bank will create two new companies in Barbados, to be named CIBC West Indies Holdings and CIBC Caribbean. It will sell and transfer its branches and trust unit in St Lucia, St Vincent and Antigua to CIBC Caribbean. CIBC Caribbean will be wholly owned by CIBC West Indies. In the second stage, CIBC West Indies Holdings will offer shareholders of the Bank of Commerce Trinidad and Tobago the chance to swap their shares for those of CIBC West Indies Holdings.</p>

			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Book Review: British culture in the clear CAPITALISM, CULTURE AND DECLINE IN BRITAIN 1750-1990 By W D Rubinstein Routledge Pounds 25 182 pages Of all the competing explanations for Britain's poor economic performance compared with Germany and the US, the most pervasive is the belief in an anti-industrial culture. The idea is that for the past 100 years social and educational attitudes in Britain have been uniquely unfavourable to industry; this has led to a diversion of talent away from manufacturing to 'softer' activities such as the professions and the civil service. A powerful restatement of this view came in 1981 with the publication of Martin Wiener's English Culture and the Decline of the Industrial Spirit. The 'cultural critique' associated with Wiener and others holds that from about 1870 onwards the upsurge of entrepreneurial vigour which had produced the industrial revolution was blunted by 'gentrification'. Successful industrialists sent their sons to public schools where they imbibed pseudo-aristocratic values that were alien to the single-minded pursuit of production and profit. Several historians have questioned Wiener's analysis, but none have done so with as much force as W D Rubinstein. His new book, which follows several earlier studies of British elites, is written with wit and passion. It is a persuasive antidote to many of the cliches about British industrial decline; its message needs to be absorbed by speechwriters for the prime minister, John Major, and Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary. Rubinstein lays into the 'cultural critique' on three main grounds. First, he attacks its central assumption that Britain shifted from a pro- to an anti-industrial culture in the course of the 19th century. Second, he regards the notion of British economic decline as vastly exaggerated, partly because it reflects an obsession with manufacturing; it fails to take into account the country's competitive success in services. Third, he finds no evidence to support the view that the public schools engendered anti-business attitudes. Rubinstein says: 'Britain was never fundamentally an industrial and manufacturing economy; rather it was always, even at the height of the industrial revolution, essentially a commercial, financial and service-based economy whose comparative advantage lay with commerce and finance'. What is sometimes seen as Britain's economic decline was simply a shift of resources and entrepreneurial energies to other forms of business life. 'In moving from industry to commerce, Britain's entrepreneurs were responding intelligently to opportunities. This had little or nothing to do with any factor in Britain's underlying culture, elite educational system or fundamental system of values.' Rubinstein shows that even during the period from 1770 to 1860, when entrepreneurs in Lancashire and the West Riding of Yorkshire were turning Britain into the workshop of the world, the richest and most powerful group in the country were the bankers and merchants of London and the home counties. The dominance of commerce and finance was interrupted by a brief upsurge of factory capitalism in the first half of the 19th century, 'whose importance has probably been exaggerated by the fact that it had the world's first modern factories, by the fact that it is highly visible and unpleasant, and by the importance given to it by Marxism'. As for the contention that British culture was anti-industrial, he points out that if an important indicator of such attitudes is the views of writers and intellectuals, then German and perhaps even American culture has been more anti-business than that of Britain. Noting the 'cosmic anti-bourgeois sarcasm' emanating from Germany's Brechts and other left-wing writers, he argues that British culture has been much less strident in its condemnation of capitalism than any other European culture. In a study of the backgrounds and careers of public schoolboys between 1840 and 1990, Rubinstein shows that few northern industrialists sent their sons to these establishments; the suggestion that the public schools diverted talent away from industry is groundless. Sons of financiers were more likely to have been educated at public schools; yet these were the activities in which Britain, far from suffering from an anti-entrepreneurial bias, continued to enjoy a competitive advantage. In his final chapter Rubinstein discusses the interaction between the country's three elites - the landed elite, the commercial-based London elite, and the northern manufacturing elite. The third of these had its period of greatest influence between 1830 and 1870, but it was never able to establish a dominance over the other two. 'The self-conscious, acquisitive, ideologically distinctive provincial elite disappeared in the first world war, together with its vision of a liberal, meritocratic, provincial civic culture not dissimilar to that which emerged in 19th century America.' Rubinstein leaves a number of questions unanswered, not least the issue of whether the dominance of the metropolis - which is unique among advanced countries - damaged the economy. His claim that Britain's comparative advantage has always been in finance and commerce is plausible, but the balance between manufacturing and services might have been different, and better for the nation, if the social and business links between London and the north had been closer. Manufacturing remains an important part of the economy and those who worry about its competitiveness are not necessarily suffering from what Rubinstein calls 'manufacturing fetishism'. What this book does, nevertheless, is to challenge the conventional wisdom about Britain's Victorian past and thus to alter the terms of the debate about the country's present and future.

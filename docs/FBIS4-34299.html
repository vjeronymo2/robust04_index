			<p>BFN     [Text] San Jose, 16 Jun (ACAN-EFE) -- Costa Rican courts  today denied the U.S. request to extradite Hubert Matos Araluce,  son of Cuban anti-Castro leader Hubert Matos, who is wanted by  U.S. authorities for fraud.    The Fourth Constitutional Chamber's decision, which was  disclosed today, confirmed that Matos Araluce has been a Costa  Rican citizen since 24 March, according to a National  Immigration Council agreement.    The extradition request, the higher court emphasized, was  made after Costa Rican citizenship was granted to Matos Araluce,  who is currently entitled to the protection of Costa Rican laws.  The higher court indicated in its decision that the  Constitution stipulates that no Costa Rican citizen, either by  birth or naturalization, can be deported or extradited from the  country.    The decision also required the state to compensate Matos  Araluce for damages. In the extradition request, submitted by  the U.S. Embassy in San Jose, Matos Araluce is accused of  repeated fraud in Florida.</p>

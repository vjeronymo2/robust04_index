In 1990, as part of its agenda, the PCPFS initiated the first Great American Workout as a major event to focus on exercise. A second and third workout were held in 1991 and 1992 respectively. The south lawn of the White House served as the backdrop for this fitness event for the Nation. The Great American Workout for this year is scheduled to take place on May 2, 1994, pending approval from the White House. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Requirements of Participation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The PCPFS is seeking to hold this year's Great American Workout with an events planning organization which has demonstrated the ability and experience to coordinate this type of national event.

Since it is anticipated that the Great American Workout will involve events held on the grounds of the White House, certain restrictions apply to the commercial use of an events planning organization's source or sources of funding. The successful organization will be required to enter into a memorandum of understanding with the Department of Health and Human Services setting forth the details of the event. In addition, agreements with other interested parties may be required. Participation by any organization or source of funding may in no way be construed as an endorsement of any commercial product by the PCPFS. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: January 24, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Sandra P.

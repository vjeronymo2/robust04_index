			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / International Company News: French banking float given warm reception CREDIT Local de France, the specialist French banking group, yesterday announced that its FFr4.2bn (Dollars 750m) sale of state-owned shares had been heavily over-subscribed by French and foreign investors. The success of the CLF sale is encouraging for the government's ambitious privatisation plans. The government had regarded the sale as an important test of the stock market's appetite for state assets. The first round of privatisations, including Banque Nationale de Paris and Air France, is scheduled to start in early September. The domestic tranche of the CLF issue, which involved the sale of 6.5m shares, attracted applications for 113m shares, or 17 times the number available. The international tranche was also over-subscribed, generating applications for seven times the 4.4m shares allocated to foreign investors. Some FFr2.4bn of the money raised by the CLF sale will go directly to the government - the first contribution to the FFr40bn that Mr Edouard Balladur, prime minister, hopes to raise from privatisations in 1993. The remaining FFr1.8bn will go to Caisse des Depots, the public-sector financial institution, which sold the rest of the shares.</p>

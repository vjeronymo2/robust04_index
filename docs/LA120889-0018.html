			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> GRASS GOT GREENER FOR RBV, LEVINGS  </P> <P> The Dust Bowl, they called it.  </P> <P> A dried-out field surrounded by a dirt track, and a few rickety wooden  bleachers bandaged together by some old metal bars.  </P> <P> There was no grass in the middle of the field, just dry, crumbling brown dirt.  Lots of it. Thankfully, there were no games there, just practices -- long, hot  and dusty.  </P> <P> Rancho Buena Vista senior tight end Shannon Levings started his varsity  football career on this field three years ago.  </P> <P> It was at Lincoln Junior High School in Vista. Each day after school, a few  dozen RBV players would climb into a bus for the mile trek to the practice  field. The older guys with drivers' licenses would ferry themselves.  </P> <P> Levings rode the bus. Oh, sometimes he would hitch a ride with one of the  seniors. But he was just a sophomore, so he usually kept quiet and boarded the  bus.  </P> <P> Levings was a pioneer, a starter on RBV's first football team. He remembers  those days well, particularly the days on that Lincoln Junior High School  field. RBV players still joke about the Dust Bowl.  </P> <P> "It was kind of a bad field," Levings said.  </P> <P> In those days, there wasn't much choice. It was 1987, and a football program  was being born.  </P> <P> Flip the Shannon Levings scrapbook ahead about three years, and the field is a  whole lot different. It's still 100 yards long, but now it's covered with  grass. Lots of grass. And look around. There are lots of seats. San Diego Jack  Murphy Stadium seats more than 50,000 people.  </P> <P> They call it The Stadium. All season, high school football players dream of  playing for the championship in The Stadium.  </P> <P> Saturday, RBV will be there to play Morse for the section 3-A title.  </P> <P> It will be the second consecutive appearance there for Levings and his  teammates. RBV won the 2-A section championship last year, 21-10, over San  Pasqual. This year, the Longhorns can become the first team to win a 2-A  championship one year and a 3-A title the next.  </P> <P> And one more thing. Since last season, they've been practicing on a field at  their own school. They've come a long way from Lincoln Junior High.  </P> <P> At 6-feet, 190-pounds, Levings isn't a prototype tight end. He isn't  all-county; he isn't even first-team all-league.  </P> <P> "He looks more like a gardener," RBV Coach Craig Bell said. "Or like a kid in  the back row struggling to get a passing grade. But his heart is probably  bigger than the city of Vista."  </P> <P> Levings -- second-team All-Palomar League this season -- has started on the  varsity for as long as RBV and its football team have existed. He was a split  end his sophomore season on a team that went 4-5-1, and he was a split end his  junior year on the 13-0 2-A team. This year, he moved to tight end. He will  finish his senior season with another trip to The Stadium.  </P> <P> When you read RBV's press clippings, you won't find his name mentioned often.  He caught only five passes this season for 135 yards and three touchdowns  despite starting nine of RBV's 11 games (he missed the first two playoff games  with a strained knee). But he's a solid high school football player, a cog in a  championship team.  </P> <P> "He isn't real large, yet he's blocked everybody from 280 to 140-pounders,"  Bell said. "He doesn't have great hands, but he always catches the ball. He  isn't real quick, but he manages to get free. He can't, but he always does.  </P> <P> "On paper, you look at him and say, 'Nope. No way. It can't be done.' But he's  one of the best things that's happened to us."  </P> <P> In an offense built around the rushing game, a tight end blocks. Markeith Ross  and O.J. Hall, RBV's two 2,000-yard running backs, get the glory. Levings gets  the bruises.  </P> <P> He has played football for seven years. He played his freshman season at Vista  High, three years of Pop Warner before that.  </P> <P> Now, he has reached the end of the line. There are no college scholarships  waiting -- there's not much of a market for small tight ends. Levings is  considering San Diego State or Cal State Long Beach. He will study art, not  square-outs.  </P> <P> "Maybe if I were a few inches taller, I'd be thinking about playing more," he  said. "I like playing, but I will have a lot of good things to look back on."  </P> <P> This week has been one of them.  </P> <P> "With all of the stuff that's been happening to the team lately, everybody is  telling us it's not very often that stuff like this happens," he said. "It's  really weird when you think about it. I'm more nervous this year than last  year. It's my senior year. I have to go out with a bang."  </P> <P> Levings nearly went out with a splash during his sophomore year. He was on the  Vista swimming team as a freshman, and he enjoyed it so much he was ready to  give up football for water polo the next fall. He was talked out of it by Bell  and RBV quarterback David Roberts.  </P> <P> "David Roberts ragged me, and then he told Coach Bell," Levings said. "When we  registered for sports (the summer before Levings' sophomore year), Coach Bell  said, 'I hear you play football. But you go to swimming for a year, and we lose  you to water polo.' He said something about having water in my ears."  </P> <P> So Levings changed his mind. One of his rewards comes Saturday when he makes  his second trip to the stadium.  </P> <P> "I never played water polo before anyway," he said. "I was just going to try  out for something new."  </P> <P> In three years, he has seen a bunch of guys grow from rookie status into a real  team.  </P> <P> "Me and David played Pop Warner together," he said. "Just yesterday, we were  talking about how far we've come. We were talking about how important it is to  make our senior season the best. Now, we have to win one more."  </P> <P> And after Saturday -- win or lose -- Levings will close one chapter of his  life. He will turn his attention to the rest of his senior year, and football  will be only a memory.  </P> <P> Sure, he will remember those crunching blocks, lopsided victories, and even a  few losses. He will remember a handful of catches and a fistful of practices.  But mostly, he said, he will remember pregame moments, sitting around the  locker room with friends and catching up on the week's events.  </P> <P> And bottom line, he said, is that the best thing about having played three  years of varsity football is all of the friends he has made.  </P> <P> "I figure," he said, "maybe I'll hang out with these guys later."  </P></p>

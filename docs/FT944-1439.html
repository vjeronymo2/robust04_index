			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Charles Sidney in bid for Bletchley Charles Sidney, the Mercedes-Benz truck and car dealer, has made a recommended all-share offer for Bletchley Motor Group, which has 19 volume car dealerships, in a deal which values the latter at about Pounds 16m, or 260p a share. BMG's shares fell 5p to 260p and Charles Sidney's were unchanged at 90p. Charles Sidney has received irrevocable undertakings from Mr David Dunn, BMG chairman and chief executive, and the other BMG directors to accept the offer. They speak for 1.44m shares, or 23.5 per cent of the issued capital. Under the terms, existing Charles Sidney shareholders will hold 57.1 per cent of the enlarged group, and BMG shareholders 42.9 per cent. Charles Sidney is offering 2.8938 new shares for every BMG share. Full acceptance will entail the issue of up to about 17.8m new shares. BMG shareholders will also receive a special 2p dividend. Mr Raymond Edwards, Charles Sidney chairman, said: 'There is no geographical clash and there is no manufacturer clash.' Charles Sidney has dealerships in Yorkshire and Scotland and sells Mercedes-Benz vehicles. BMG is based in the northern home counties and its dealerships include Vauxhall, Rover, Toyota, Fiat, Peugeot, Citroen, Honda and Ford. Mr Edwards said the manufacturers, far from seeing problems in the merger, saw it as positive. He added that there were opportunities for cross-selling  - in that BMG's rental fleets are small and do not include commercial vehicles  - and that the contract hire and rental divisions of both groups would be brought under one management. In the year to August 31, the ungeared Charles Sidney made pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.87m (Pounds 2.46m) on turnover of Pounds 72.2m (Pounds 55.8m). In the six months to June 30, BMG made profits of Pounds 1.1m (Pounds 800,000) pre-tax on turnover of Pounds 52.7m (Pounds 39.6m).</p>

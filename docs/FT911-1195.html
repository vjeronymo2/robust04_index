			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / The Lex Column: US refunding The US Treasury market has not Quayled in front of the Dollars 37bn refunding due this week, despite a falling dollar and growing support for the recovery-this-year scenario - the latest from the influential Purchasing Managers' Association. Its semi-annual forecast calls for rising output in the second half, though not enough to prevent a drop in manufacturing for 1991 as a whole. But the Senate Budget Committee voted unanimously yesterday to ignore the anti-recession clause in the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law, and keep existing spending limits in place, so the public sector remains under some sort of restraint. Meanwhile, industrial investment is seen by the purchasing managers as weaker than in earlier forecasts; and likely to remain so. This suggests weak credit demand from the most credit-worthy private borrowers. Treasury bonds, especially the Dollars 13.5bn of three-year paper on offer yesterday, look like an attractive investment for banks: where else can you find a riskless 134-basis-point spread over Federal Funds? Is this just a temporary flight to quality, or something more significant? It is not so many years since banks routinely held half their assets or more in government paper; and they may now be risk-averse enough to regress to those days. Treasury Secretary James Brady was yesterday begging Congress to go easy on demands for higher capital, for fear of squeezing the banks still further. But if they want to hold Treasury paper anyway, enforced prudence will make little difference.</p>

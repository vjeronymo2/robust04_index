			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "D.Gd.": "Military Report Describes Emeraude </F> Accident"]    [Text] No human error and no nuclear contamination: Those  are the main conclusions of the military commission of inquiry  set up to look into the accident on board the nuclear-powered  attack submarine [SNA] Emeraude on 30 March, in which 10 crew  members died. In a communique summarizing the report (150 pages  sent to the public prosecutor in Marseilles), the Defense  Ministry reconstructed the accident which occurred during  maneuvers off Toulon. According to this version of events, the  submarine was submerged at 190 meters. Between two training  phases, the commander (who was among the victims) carried out a  "section inspection" in the turbo-alternator compartment that  "had been planned several weeks earlier to be done on that day."    At 10:35, 12 men were in the compartment when "a leak  occurred in the sea water refrigeration collector." This leak  was not, therefore, in the external hull but in an internal  pipe. The "energy" officer left the compartment to return to  the central navigation station, while emergency maneuvers were  made to resurface the vessel in 100 seconds: Power was upped to  increase speed, the sea water circuits were closed to prevent  flooding, and the ballast tanks were emptied to accelerate  resurfacing.    It was probably this combination of operations that led to  "overpressure in one of the condensers," and then the "breaking  of a clack plug, causing steam to pour into the compartment."  Ten submariners were killed instantly by barotraumatism causing  their eardrums and lungs to explode. One man managed to survive  by taking refuge in the forward section of the compartment. The  communique added: "The commission of inquiry found no evidence  of human error attributable to the crew members at the time of  the accident." Our sources tell us that a mechanic, responsible  for closing two outlets to stop the steam escaping when the  ascent was started, only had time to close one of them before he  was killed. The Defense Ministry authorized the six SNAs that  had been recalled for checks to once again take to the sea,  instructing the "immediate closure of the steam circuits in the  event of a water leak." However, it appears difficult to  implement steam shutdown when a water leak appears, since it is  necessary for rapid resurfacing.</p>

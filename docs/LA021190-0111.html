			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> MUSEUM'S COMMONPLACE OBJECTS PUT FOCUS ON UNUSUAL HORROR;  </P> <P> HOLOCAUST: CURATORS ARE COLLECTING ARTIFACTS OF JEWS AND OTHER VICTIMS OF THE  NAZI DEATH CAMPS. THE CENTER WILL BE THE LARGEST OF ITS KIND IN THE WORLD.  </P> <P> Pots and pans, a young girl's cloth belt, fading snapshots, a box of shoes. The  ordinary stuff of ordinary people's lives, they assume a horrifying  significance in the archives of the new Holocaust museum being built near the  National Mall.  </P> <P> These simple objects are made extraordinary by the awful events that gave them  meaning. This is no ordinary museum, either.  </P> <P> Chartered by Congress in 1980, its purpose is not to celebrate the triumphs of  Western civilization but to shine a glaring, uncomfortable light on one of its  darkest moments, the Nazi slaughter of 6 million Jews and untold millions of  Gypsies, homosexuals, physically handicapped people and other "undesirables"  during World War II.  </P> <P> Although there are Holocaust museums in Los Angeles and Detroit, and one under  construction in New York, Washington's will be the only national Holocaust  museum in the United States. When completed, it also will be the largest in the  world, surpassing the Yad Vashem national Holocaust center in Jerusalem.  </P> <P> "Most museums, like the National Gallery of Art, begin with a valuable  collection that requires a building to house it," said Holocaust museum  spokesman Sam Eskenazi. "Our museum is being built because it has a story to  tell, and we're collecting artifacts to tell that story."  </P> <P> In the last 18 months, as cement was poured for the museum's foundations,  archivists have been deluged with more than 10,000 artifacts donated by  Holocaust survivors and their children, or obtained through negotiations with  authorities in East Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia and other Eastern European  countries.  </P> <P> The smaller objects include diaries, sketches, real or forged identity papers,  Star of David clothing patches, striped inmate uniforms, coins and stamps used  in Jewish ghettos, clandestine sketches of life in concentration camps and  secret coded messages exchanged by prisoners.  </P> <P> These items might be considered commonplace "ephemera" by other museums, but  Holocaust museum curator Susan Morgenstein invented the term "survivor objects"  to signify their value as "hard and fast documentation of a fragmentary period  in history."  </P> <P> Each has been catalogued and stored in gray, acid-free boxes in the  climate-controlled rooms of a warehouse whose location is kept secret for  security reasons. Some will be chosen for display in the permanent exhibition  when the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum opens in April, 1993.  </P> <P> "They have a special power to tell the human stories of the Holocaust,"  Morgenstein said. "Each of them, like the survivors themselves, has a story to  tell."  </P> <P> Ruth Meyerowitz was 13 when her family was deported from Frankfurt, Germany, to  Auschwitz-Birkenau in April, 1943. Separated from her father and brother, she  and her mother lived in a barracks near the crematoriums where more than 2  million people -- mostly Jews -- were killed.  </P> <P> One day, as she sorted through a mound of loot confiscated from new prisoners,  Meyerowitz retrieved a blue belt appliqued with colorful, floral-shaped felt  cutouts, "obviously the work of a young girl, probably from somewhere in  Eastern Europe."  </P> <P> Risking a beating for violating camp regulations, Meyerowitz wore the forbidden  piece of finery cinched at the waist of her long uniform skirt, to keep it from  dragging in the mud.  </P> <P> As Meyerowitz lost weight and the belt got looser, she tried to convince her  worried mother that the belt was magical. "I explained that I'm not getting  thinner, but the belt is getting longer," said Meyerowitz, who now lives in  West Orange, N.J.  </P> <P> William Luksenburg of Silver Spring, Md., donated the tattered, striped woolen  jacket that he wore in the Flossenberg concentration camp. It had been hanging  in the back of his closet for 40 years.  </P> <P> "Ten to 20 years from now, there won't be any survivors left to tell the  stories," Luksenburg said. "My jacket is evidence that will speak to future  generations."  </P> <P> Among other items, the museum has acquired:  </P> <P>  -- A box of brushes -- hairbrushes, toothbrushes -- seized from Auschwitz  inmates, and 2,000 pairs of children's shoes and empty canisters of Zyklon-B  poison gas from the Majdanek killing center.  </P> <P>  -- A 27-foot freight car that once shuttled 100 Jews at a time from the Warsaw  ghetto to Treblinka, along with a section of the tracks it rode into the death  camp. The former cattle car is housed in a warehouse somewhere in North  Carolina, where conservators are stripping paint to find the original wartime  layer of reddish-brown, complete with markings and graffiti.  </P> <P>  -- A tourist-class ticket on the luxury liner St. Louis, which carried 936  passengers -- most of them Jews with American visas -- on an ill-fated cruise  from Germany to Cuba, where they planned to wait their turn for entry into the  United States. They were turned back at Havana and eventually were forced to  return to Europe. The ticket-holder, Moritz Schoenberger, was one of the few on  board to survive the war.  </P> <P>  -- A crushed doll carriage, some bricks, glass fragments and rubble from the  Warsaw ghetto, the largest in Nazi Europe until it was demolished in 1943. Also  excavated and shipped to the museum were 2,000 square feet of cobblestones once  trodden upon by the ghetto's doomed Jewish inhabitants.  </P> <P>  -- The "02," the only surviving motorboat used in a secret Danish rescue  operation to ferry 1,400 Jews and Resistance fighters from Nazi-occupied  Denmark to safety in neighboring Sweden.  </P> <P>  -- A partially burned Nazi flag and some 8-millimeter color movie footage shot  from the stone ramparts of Mauthausen, a notoriously harsh SS concentration  camp in Austria, by an American liberator in 1945, Army Sgt. Ray Buch.  </P> <P> Associate curators Charlotte Hebebrand and Jacek Nowakowski have spent the past  year scouring Eastern Europe with a shopping list of prized artifacts. They  will make their first trip to the Soviet Union soon to search for relics of the  Nazi massacre of 17,000 to 30,000 Jews at Babi Yar, a ditch outside Minsk, in  1941.  </P> <P> Despite their best efforts, some objects -- like their Jewish owners -- may  have perished without a trace in the Holocaust. Nowakowski said he despairs of  ever finding a pedicar, the pedal-operated taxi that once was commonplace in  the Warsaw ghetto.  </P> <P> Similarly, Nowakowski has searched in vain for menorahs, or ritual  candlesticks, and other religious objects used in ancient Jewish communities  that were obliterated by invading Nazis. But he was surprised during a visit to  the museum that is the only thing left of Chelmno, an infamous killing center  in western Poland.  </P> <P> "I didn't expect to find anything there," Nowakowski said, because fleeing  Nazis had blown up the crematoriums and reduced Chelmno to rubble before Allied  troops arrived. Yet he found a few keys, knives, forks, a cloth cap and  spectacle lenses left by Jewish victims, as well as concrete blocks unearthed  from the foundations of a crematorium.  </P> <P> Martin Smith, the prize-winning British documentary film producer who is  director of the museum's permanent collection, recently received the unexpected  gift of an accordion, inlaid with mother-of-pearl, from the son of a Romanian  Gypsy who perished in the Holocaust.  </P> <P> "I'm trying desperately to find a Gypsy caravan," Smith said.  </P> <P> The five-story museum, designed by architect James I. Freed, a partner of I.M.  Pei and himself a child refugee from Nazi Germany, is being built on 1.9 acres  donated by the government and is administered by a federal agency with a  $2-million annual budget.  </P></p>

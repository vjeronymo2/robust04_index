			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Salim 'Ali Dhiyab, Jordan TV correspondent for </F> political affairs]    [Text] His Majesty King Husayn has chaired a cabinet  meeting in the presence of His Royal Highness Crown Prince Hasan  and Royal Court Chief al-Sharif Zayd Bin-Shakir. His majesty  reviewed the results of his recent visit to the United States,  Austria, and Croatia. His majesty also reviewed the results of  his recent visit to Syria.    The discussion during the cabinet session also dealt with a  number of domestic issues. His majesty talked about the  importance of maintaining the people's water, food, and medicine  supplies, as well as meeting their basic needs. The king noted  that we are facing a phase of challenges, adding that the  Jordanian people should be well prepared to face this phase.    Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali briefed his  majesty on the mechanism through which the best services are  being rendered to people in all fields of life.    King Husayn told journalists at the end of the cabinet  session that every effort is being made to provide the best  possible services to the Jordanian citizens, noting that we all  always work to underscore the need to care for them.    [Begin recording] [Husayn] This was an opportunity to brief  the brothers on a part of what took place. Naturally, the prime  minister was abreast of all that took place during my absence.  Again, I underscored my absolute confidence in, and my gratitude  and appreciation for, the prime minister and this government for  the services they are providing to the homeland under these  delicate circumstances and with our great hopes for the future.  Naturally, we reviewed many projects and many studies in  general, and some in detail.    [Dhiyab] Your Majesty, in your capacity as the sponsor of  Yemeni reconciliation, what are the most recent developments?    [Husayn] We hope our brothers in Yemen will succeed in  ending  what they are dealing with in this phase. We also hope that we  will have the honor of hosting their meeting in Amman to save  Yemen now and open the road for a prosperous future, God  willing. We have given our utmost, and we will be very happy to  see an opportunity to resolve and tackle the existing problems  within the Arab community. We responded throughout this to the  desire of the two parties of our brothers in Yemen. We always  appreciate the confidence they have placed in us. We ask God to  grant us success in assuming our duty toward them.    [Reporter] Your Majesty, how do you view the future of the  peace process in light of the recent developments and in light  of your recent efforts represented in your visit to the United  States and to Damascus? And what are the results of the last  round of the Arab-Israeli peace talks?    [Husayn] I believe that as things go on, we monitor what is  happening within our utmost capabilities. Our basic stand is to  support the Palestinian brothers with regard to their rights on  their national soil. I cannot say that the present coordination  is at it should be. With regard to Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon  coordination is normal. Praise be to God, the situation is  good, reassuring, and promising. The recent meetings achieved  some progress. With regard to Jordan, we concentrate on the  agenda and on its topics. As with regard to the whole world,  everybody hopes that this march, which has passed the point of  no return, will continue until we reach a just and comprehensive  solution that will be accepted by the coming generations.    [Reporter] Sir, what are the most prominent topics you  discussed during your visit to sisterly Syria?    [Husayn] First, I had a duty to fulfill toward a big and  dear  brother who was hard hit by a mournful event, which hit me and  hit us all, as a result of his loss of his son, whom I also  considered as my son. So, I had to pay this visit immediately  after my return. We also reviewed the peace process, bilateral  cooperation, all issues in the region, the contacts we made in  the world both on the part of his excellency the president and  on my part. I emerged very satisfied with the results of this  visit.    [Reporter] Your Majesty, with regard to martyr Na'ib  al-Ma'ayitah and the Lebanese Government's arrest of the  criminals who carried out this operation. What are the measures  to be taken by the Jordanian Government regarding this?    [Husayn] We are following the issue with great concern and  determination to reach what is required regarding such a hideous  crime. We appreciate the efforts that the brothers in Lebanon  have exerted and are exerting to reveal all the objectives and  dimensions of this crime. I cannot say more than this at this  point.

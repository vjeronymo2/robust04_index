			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Du Cann meets creditors to ward off bankruptcy SIR EDWARD du Cann, a former chairman of the Conservative party and of Lonrho, the international trading conglomerate, yesterday met his creditors in an attempt to stave off personal bankruptcy. Sir Edward said he had put proposals for paying off a proportion of his debts to creditors at the meeting. He described the meeting as 'useful'. Under an individual voluntary arrangement scheme 75 per cent of the creditors (in value) have to vote in favour for an agreement to go through. The only vote taken yesterday ratified a decision to adjourn the meeting for 14 days. No vote was taken on Sir Edward's proposals, which he said were a 'private matter between creditors and myself'. Two separate sources said, however, that Sir Edward had offered creditors about 40p in the pound if they agreed to a voluntary arrangement. Creditors include the Leeds Permanent Building Society, the Inland Revenue and the City law firm Denton Hall Burgin and Warrens, legal advisers to Lonrho. Sir Edward resigned as a director of Homes Assured, the mortgage company which collapsed in 1989, just days before its liquidation. The ensuing controversy led to his resignation from Lonrho.</p>

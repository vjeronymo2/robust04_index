			<p><P> October 4, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> SKINNER ASKS MORE SAY IN TAKEOVERS  </P> <P> Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner told Congress today that his  department wants more say in takeovers of U.S. airlines involving foreign  investors.  </P> <P> He told the Senate aviation subcommittee that it would have been easier if it  had become involved earlier in the takeover of Northwest Airlines so he could  have warned the new owners against giving KLM Royal Dutch Airlines so big a  stake.  </P> <P> On Friday the department ordered the group buying Northwest's parent NWA Inc.,  led by financier Alfred A. Checchi, to reduce KLM's role in the deal.  </P> <P> Under federal law, U.S. airlines cannot be controlled by foreigners. The  original deal would have given the Dutch airline 57% of the non-voting equity  in Northwest and a seat on its board of directors.  </P></p>

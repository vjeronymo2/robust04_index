			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule provides that where State or regional standards and guidelines are not developed within 18 months of the effective date of the proposed rule, fallback standards and guidelines included in the text of the rule would be implemented. The fallback standards address the same factors relating to soil stability and watershed function, the distribution of nutrients and energy, the recovery mechanisms of plant communities, and riparian functioning condition as provided for under the guiding principles. However, the fallback standards include more detail as to the conditions that would exist under each of the factors when rangelands are in healthy, functional condition. Under the fallback standards, rangelands would be measured against benchmarks for the presence and development of top soils, evidence of active soil erosion, distribution of plants and nutrients in both space and time, distribution of plant litter, rooting throughout the available soil profile, the growth forms of plants, plant vigor, the presence of a range of age classes for the vegetation on site, presence and development of flood plains, and channel sinuosity, width-to-depth ratio, and gradient in relation to the landscape setting. Individual sites may be in healthy, functional condition even though they do not meet all of these measures; however, the Department feels that generally failing to meet the benchmarks across an area the size of a typical grazing pasture or allotment would be reliable evidence that the specific area is not in healthy, functional condition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fallback guidelines for grazing administration would restrict management practices to those activities that assist in or do not hinder meeting certain legal mandates and achieving or maintaining rangeland health. The fallback guidelines address the same types of actions and practices that are considered under the guiding principles for the development of State or regional guidelines, but present these actions and practices as guidance for management. The fallback guidelines include the requirement that grazing management practices be implemented that assist in or do not hinder the recovery of threatened or endangered species, or assist in, or do not hinder, preventing the listing of species identified as candidates for threatened or endangered species. The fallback guidelines would also require that grazing practices be implemented that would assist in attaining and protecting water quality consistent with the Clean Water Act. Other fallback guidelines would require that grazing schedules include periods of rest during times of critical plant growth or regrowth, limit the authorization of continuous season-long grazing to instances where it has been demonstrated to be consistent with achieving or maintaining rangeland health and meeting established resource objectives. Spring developments or other projects affecting water would be required to be designed to protect the ecological values of the affected sites. Livestock management practices or management facilities would generally be required to be located outside of riparian-wetland areas, and where standards for these areas are not being met, the facilities could be removed or relocated, or the management practices modified. The fallback guidelines would also require the establishment and application of utilization or residual vegetation targets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fallback standards and guidelines could be tailored by the BLM State Director better to fit local ecosystems and management practices. Modifications of the fallback standards and guidelines would require the approval of the Secretary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Standards and guidelines would be adhered to in the development of grazing-related portions of activity plans, and would be reflected in permits and leases as terms and conditions. Where data, including field observations, found acceptable to the authorized officer indicate that the standards and guidelines are not being met, the authorized officer would be required to take appropriate action, such as adjusting numbers, seasons, or duration of use by livestock, or modifying other management practices or range improvements, as soon as practicable but not later than the start of the next grazing year. Standards and guidelines would not be implemented prior to approval by the Secretary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

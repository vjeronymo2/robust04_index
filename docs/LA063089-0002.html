			<p><P> June 30, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PROBLEMS BESET S.D. PLAN TO CUT DROPOUT RATE  </P> <P> Poor planning and coordination have plagued the first year of a much-publicized  dropout prevention program that began in September as a $433,000 joint effort  of San Diego city schools and private industry.  </P> <P> Crucial elements of the innovative program have not yet been put into place,  and administrators still have no data telling them whether the first students  to receive special computer-assisted instruction, counseling and employment  training have returned to their regular schools as hoped for or have dropped  out, Deputy Supt. Bertha Pendleton confirmed Thursday.  </P> <P> A new, full-time administrator has been assigned temporarily beginning this  week to the program at the city schools' Bandini Center in Southeast San Diego  to try to iron out problems. The previous administrator had been assigned the  role only part-time, a situation Pendleton said, was "overwhelming."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Disappointment Conceded  </P> <P> "We're trying to work through things," Pendleton said, conceding disappointment  at the rocky road the Youth Services Center has taken during its first two  semesters. Pendleton oversees the district's intensive efforts to begin dealing  with its high number of dropouts, especially among black and Latino students.  </P> <P> The Bandini project was conceived as a centerpiece to those efforts, modeled  after a small but successful privately funded summer program piloted in San  Diego for the past several years. The school district provided $150,000, and  the Private Industry Council gave $285,000 as a commitment under the  public-private San Diego Compact to prevent students from dropping out.  </P> <P> The plan enrolls up to 60 junior-high students who are considered to be at high  risk of dropping out. They are selected from targeted minority-area schools and  given one semester of basic skills tutoring using a computer-assisted  curriculum, instruction in motivation and self-esteem, and a part-time job or  employment training. By removing students temporarily from an environment where  they are failing, administrators say they can build confidence to attempt a  successful return.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Return to Home School  </P> <P> Following the intensive semester of individual attention, the students return  to their home school, where counselors follow them closely as well as pair them  with an adult mentor from the business community to help continue building  self-esteem.  </P> <P> But Pendleton cited problems in all areas of the plan.  </P> <P> While the three teachers selected for the program are all highly motivated to  work with problem students, Pendleton said, they were not given sufficient  training in the computer-assisted instructional program. That computer system,  known as PLATO, has worked successfully in bringing poorly performing students  up to speed in basic subjects in the Oceanside and Sweetwater school districts,  according to county education statistics.  </P> <P> "I'm going to be visiting the Sweetwater district in the next week or so to  take another look at what they do," Pendleton said. "I don't believe there is  anything wrong with our (curriculum) model, but maybe there are some things  that should be changed."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Admitted Breakdown  </P> <P> Pendleton also admitted a breakdown in tracking progress of the students and  said she doesn't know precisely why such information is not yet available. She  has no data to show how many of the 47 students who spent the first semester at  the center -- September through January -- are now studying successfully in a  regular program.  </P> <P> "We don't know where they are," Pendleton said, adding that there apparently  has been poor communication between the center's staff and counselors at the  regular schools. Pendleton said that every student who leaves the program is  supposed to be placed by a district counselor, who will then maintain contact.  "It's obvious we need a better articulation process," she said.  </P> <P> "I don't think anybody understood how hard it would be to work through the  bureaucracy of the city schools as well as that of the Private Industry  Council," said Jeanne Jehl, special assistant to Pendleton who took over the  program's administration this week. "But I'm going to find out where these kids  are because you can't tell whether the program is successful or not without the  information."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Key Element Missing  </P> <P> The mentor portion of the program has yet to begin, "and without it, we are  missing a key element in giving ongoing support and nurturing after the  intensive semester program," Pendleton said.  </P> <P> Jehl hopes to have some type of mentor activity under way by this fall and said  that private industry has now raised $15,000 for recruitment and training.  </P> <P> "To be honest, the failure so far stems from the compact having difficulty of  getting the attention of the business community about this program," said Jehl,  who for several years was in charge of a more limited school-industry  partnership that pairs a business with an individual school.  </P> <P> "Many businesses here have yet to understand how important education, and the  problem of at-risk students, is going to be in preparing trained employees for  their companies," Jehl said. "Because of the area's high growth, businesses  here compared to other regions are not yet hurting for employees, although they  are beginning to feel it.  </P> <P> </P> <P> More Time Needed  </P> <P> "In addition, it's difficult to get individuals to step up and get involved in  tutoring, in being a mentor . . . it takes training, more time than we first  thought."  </P> <P> In addition, Jehl said that most potential mentors from businesses "have never  been to this part of the city," referring to the poor socioeconomics of  Southeast, where the students live.  </P> <P> Pendleton noted that the students selected for the program have both severe  academic and non-academic problems, and that teachers have found it difficult  at times to work with both the teen-agers as well as their parents.  </P> <P> "At one point, we ran into some difficulty resulting from students coming from  different gangs in the same class," Pendleton said. "But with the help of  school security, and by moving one or two students out, we got control of it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Male Teachers  </P> <P> Pendleton also expressed disappointment that no male teachers were recruited  for the program, since positive male role models are considered critical for  many of these students who come from homes without fathers.  </P> <P> "Conceptually, I think we all agree that the model we have set up is valid,"  Pendleton said. "But we probably needed more time for planning, in that we were  in essence setting up a new school with an interdisciplinary program."  </P> <P> A formal review of the first year will be completed this summer, she said, and  will examine whether the program might work better if housed at a regular  school rather than at the isolated special center.  </P></p>

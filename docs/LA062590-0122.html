			<p><P> June 25, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: CHUTZPAH PAYS OFF: MANDELA'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY  </P> <P> THE PUBLISHING world is agog over the clever and efficient manner in which  Little, Brown acted to snag the Nelson Mandela autobiography. Hardly was the  South African revolutionary out of prison last February when editor-in-chief  Bill Phillips was winging his way to Johannesburg in a real cloak-and-dagger  maneuver. People who called Bill's office in Boston were told that even his  staff had no idea where he was.  </P> <P> Upon his return to South Africa, Mandela will fall to and really begin work on  this book. There is, as yet, no title for this tome, but Little, Brown calls it  "The Memoir." They hope to publish in 1992.  </P> <P> BOY GEORGE just headlined a benefit in L.A. for a center that deals with the  emotional problems of young drug addicts. Show biz in general seems to have  slammed the door and forgotten the British star since his own headlines of  arrest and drug addiction. But the fact is that it was Boy George who caused  the California benefit to sell out. He also won raves from American critics.  </P> <P> He sang live to prerecorded backing and sounded amazing. His new songs are his  best to date. And he ended using the Hare Krishna Temple Choir for a backup.  They are saying the young talent is now more spiritually attuned and his next  album for Virgin Records will be titled "Jesus Loves You."  </P> <P> ELIZABETH TAYLOR acted against doctor's orders and the wishes of her own four  children when she insisted on appearing at the AIDS conference in San  Francisco. Do the weekly tabloids, who had the star dead and buried, experience  even a twinge of shame when they see this living legend emerge Phoenix-like  from her illness and come out of the hospital? Naaaaa!  </P> <P> SUZY HAS written lots about record tycoon David Geffen's buying of the Jack and  Ann Warner house and grounds in Beverly Hills. Here are a few additions to that  news. Geffen considers his $47-million purchase to have been "a steal." You can  subtract big bucks from the purchase price because David is selling the  furniture and many of the contents at auction. He could make as much as $9  million on same.  </P> <P> Already Geffen sold to Warner Bros. the collection of Jack Warner's eight movie  Oscars and all his leather-bound film scripts. Geffen earned $3 million from  this sale alone. So take $12 million from $47 million and the buy is costing  the golden boy $35 million.  </P> <P> Geffen will keep the room in the house designed by the famous architect William  Kent. This decor is so famous it once appeared on the front page of The New  York Times.  </P></p>

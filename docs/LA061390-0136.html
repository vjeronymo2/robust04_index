			<p><P> June 13, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 1989-90: THE YEAR IN REVIEW;  </P> <P> THEY FOUGHT THE LAW, BUT THE LAW WON;  </P> <P> PREPS: LEGAL CHALLENGES TO SOUTHERN SECTION'S AUTHORITY BY FOOTBALL SUPPORTERS  AT HUNTINGTON BEACH AND SAVANNA WAS SCHOOL YEAR'S TOP STORY.  </P> <P> Two ineligible football players, the forfeiture of two league championships and  14 victories and, finally, three court cases testing the Southern Section's  supremacy added up to the story of the year in Orange County high schools.  </P> <P> Huntington Beach High's football team forfeited eight victories and its share  of the Sunset League title and was ruled ineligible for the Division I playoffs  last fall by a vote of its league's principals for using an ineligible player  the entire season.  </P> <P> Three days later, Savanna's football team was forced by league principals to  forfeit six victories, its Orange League co-championship and a berth in the  Division VI playoffs for using an ineligible player.  </P> <P> What followed was a week of restraining orders, student protests, appeals  panels and litigation. Judges, not the players, were deciding who wins football  games.  </P> <P> Huntington Beach played a game of legal Ping-Pong, regaining its playoff spot  through a temporary restraining order that threatened the existence of the  Southern Section, the organization that governs member schools throughout  Southern California.  </P> <P> Huntington Beach replaced Fountain Valley in the Division I playoffs and was  scheduled to meet top-seeded Fontana on a Tuesday. Two days later, the Oilers  were thrown for a loss after a three-judge panel of the Fourth District Court  of Appeals took Huntington Beach out of the playoffs and reinstated Fountain  Valley.  </P> <P> The appeals panel ruled that the Southern Section had the right to bar the team  from competition for using an ineligible player. Or so it seemed.  </P> <P> Two and a half hours before Fountain Valley was scheduled to meet Fontana, the  father of a Huntington Beach player filed a federal lawsuit in a last-ditch  effort to stop the game, but a judge refused to intervene.  </P> <P> Weighing the impact he faced if he granted the order to stop the game, U.S.  District Judge J. Spencer Letts said, "It looks like the choices are to forfeit  the game and watch the riot or play it and then not count it."  </P> <P> Andrew Patterson, CIF attorney, watched the clock ticking to 6 p.m. and  wondered if the Southern Section could stop the game at that hour.  </P> <P> "The school buses have left and the field is open to the public," Patterson  said. "One or more of the teams is practicing on the field right now."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, at Savanna, about 1,000 students walked out of their classes that  week in protest of the team's last-minute disqualification for playing a  fifth-year senior who had attended three public high schools and two  continuation schools since 1984.  </P> <P> Emotions over an administrative error spilled onto the Savanna campus, where  hundreds of students congregated on the front lawn, yelling slogans and waving  signs.  </P> <P> Savanna's boosters took their case to the courtroom, where an Orange County  Superior Court commissioner ruled that the team had been properly removed from  postseason play by Orange League principals.  </P> <P> "I see no abuse of discretion or violation of the rules," said Commissioner  Julian Cimbaluk in ruling that there were no grounds to reinstate Savanna in  the playoffs. "They (the league principals) didn't arbitrarily disqualify the  team. They had the right to do so under the rules."  </P> <P> Naturally, players, students, administrators, parents and boosters from both  schools were distraught. Huntington Beach had earned only its third playoff  berth in 23 years. Savanna had won its first league title since the school  opened in 1961.  </P> <P> Courtroom cases had the biggest impact in the 1989-90 school year, but there  were other noteworthy accomplishments, both on and off the athletic fields.  Here's the best of the rest:  </P> <P> The Shot of the Year: It was more of an afterthought than a shot, but point  guard Jason Quinn's 20-foot desperation shot with 1.8 seconds remaining gave  Mater Dei a 46-45 victory over Long Beach Poly in the Southern California  Division I title game. Mater Dei went on to win its second state title.  </P> <P> A Gentleman Coach Retires: Herb Hill surpassed Anaheim's Clare VanHoorebeke as  the county's winningest football coach in his final season at Loara. Hill, 59,  won 191 games in 28 seasons as Loara's only coach since the school opened in  1962.  </P> <P> Who's No. 1?: The question of the county's best football team was settled in  the final regular-season game, when Capistrano Valley met El Toro in a battle  of unbeatens. Capistrano Valley won, 22-21, when tailback Chris Adams scored a  touchdown and added a two-point conversion run in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> An Impressive Streak Ends: The Brea-Olinda girls' basketball team had won 55  consecutive games when it entered the Oakland Coliseum Arena for the State  Division III title game against Auburn Placer. Brea's players left in tears  after a 54-43 loss.  </P> <P> Marina's Minor Miracle: Three-year starting catcher Robin Lindsey quit the team  for three days, Coach Paul Renfrow's job was in jeopardy at one time and the  school's baseball team had failed to qualify for postseason play for 10 years.  But the Vikings scored five consecutive upsets to win the 5-A division title at  Anaheim Stadium. Lindsey got the championship game-winning hit in a 6-4 victory  over Diamond Bar.  </P> <P> Getting to the Point: Amy Jalewalia of La Quinta established a county  single-game scoring record with 60 points in an 85-32 victory over Kennedy.  Jalewalia broke former Whittier Christian standout Cindy Vyskocil's mark of 59  points set in 1986-87.  </P> <P> Getting Tough: Reacting to increased violence at prep games, principals of six  high schools in the Fullerton Union High School District adopted an athletic  conduct policy that allows schools to suspend coaches or players who are  ejected from athletic events, involved in altercations or leave the sideline or  bench during an altercation.  </P> <P> A Record Leap: Phouphet Singbandith of Magnolia set a county record in the  triple jump with his leap of 51 feet 7 3/4 inches -- the second-best mark in  the nation -- to win the state title. Singbandith, a native of Laos, immigrated  to California with his family as a 7-year-old.  </P> <P> An Undefeated Career: Zach Cooper, Canyon's 191-pound wrestler, capped a  brilliant career by winning the first National High School Wrestling  Championship in Pittsburgh, Pa. Cooper won 100 matches without a loss over the  past two years.  </P> <P> A Parochial Decision: Members of the Southern Section's general council voted  that "program compatibility" is not a criteria for placing schools into  geographic areas for the purposes of putting them in a league. The vote opens  the door for private schools in the county to join public leagues in 1992.  </P> <P> COUNTY RECORD-SETTERS  </P> <P> BASEBALL  </P> <P> D.C. Olsen of Fullerton set two county single-season records. His 13 home runs  surpassed the 12 hit by Andy Ruscitto of Valencia in 1986, and his .595 batting  average bettered the .585 mark set in 1980 by Steve Evans of Anaheim.  </P> <P> GIRLS' BASKETBALL  </P> <P> Amy Jalewalia of La Quinta set a county single-game scoring record of 60 points  in an 85-32 Garden Grove League victory over Kennedy.  </P> <P> Debbie Fischer of Edison set a national record for three-point baskets in a  season (105). She also set a Southern Section record for most three-point  baskets in a game (10), a feat she managed twice.  </P> <P> FOOTBALL  </P> <P> Ron Papazian of Whittier Christian set a county single-season record with 35  touchdowns, breaking the former mark of 32 set in 1984 by Esperanza's Jim  Farrell.  </P> <P> With a 43-7 Empire League victory over El Dorado, Loara Coach Herb Hill  recorded his county career record 191st victory, surpassing the 190 games won  by Clare VanHoorebeke, former Anaheim coach.  </P> <P> SWIMMING  </P> <P> Gavin Arroyo of Villa Park set a Southern Section record in the 100-yard  freestyle with a time of 45.30 seconds, which broke the 45.31 mark set in 1987  by Darren Ward of Sonora.  </P> <P> TRACK AND FIELD  </P> <P> Kevin Carlson of Katella won the state high jump title with a leap of 7 feet,  breaking the former county record of 6-11 3/4 set in 1983 by Foothill's Doug  Dreibelbis -- a record tied by Carlson earlier this season.  </P> <P> Phouphet Singbandith of Magnolia set the county record in the triple jump with  a leap of 51- 3/4 at the Arcadia Invitational. Singbandith bettered that mark  with a 51-7 3/4 to win the state title. The previous county record of 50-3 1/2  was set in 1982 by Troy's Ken Williams.  </P> <P> SECTION TITLES FROM THE COUNTY  </P> <P> Southern Section team championships won by county schools during the 1989-90  season:  </P> <P> FOOTBALL  </P> <P> Division VI: Corona del Mar  </P> <P> Division VIII: Trabuco Hills  </P> <P> GIRLS' VOLLEYBALL  </P> <P> 3-A Division: La Habra  </P> <P> WATER POLO  </P> <P> 4-A Division: Corona del Mar  </P> <P> 3-A Division: El Toro  </P> <P> GIRLS' TENNIS  </P> <P> 4-A Division: Corona del Mar  </P> <P> 3-A Division: Dana Hills  </P> <P> BOYS' BASKETBALL  </P> <P> 5-A Division: Mater Dei  </P> <P> 3-AA Division: Estancia  </P> <P> GIRLS' BASKETBALL  </P> <P> 4-A Division: La Quinta  </P> <P> 3-AA Division: Brea-Olinda  </P> <P> 3-A Division: Costa Mesa  </P> <P> BOYS' SOCCER  </P> <P> 3-A Division: El Toro  </P> <P> 2-A Division: Laguna Hills  </P> <P> GIRLS' SOCCER  </P> <P> 4-A Division: El Toro  </P> <P> 3-A Division: Mater Dei  </P> <P> WRESTLING  </P> <P> 4-A Division: Canyon  </P> <P> 3-A Division: Mater Dei  </P> <P> BASEBALL  </P> <P> 5-A Division: Marina  </P> <P> SOFTBALL  </P> <P> 5-A Division: Marina  </P> <P> 3-A Division: El Toro  </P> <P> BOYS' TRACK AND FIELD  </P> <P> 3-A Division: Esperanza  </P> <P> BOYS' SWIMMING  </P> <P> 4-A Division: Capistrano Valley  </P> <P> 2-A Division: Laguna Hills  </P> <P> GIRLS' SWIMMING  </P> <P> 4-A Division: Mission Viejo  </P> <P> 3-A Division: Los Alamitos  </P> <P> 2-A Division: Mater Dei  </P> <P> GOLF  </P> <P> All-Division: Estancia  </P> <P> BADMINTON  </P> <P> 4-A Division: Buena Park  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 8, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOVERNOR'S FAMILY PLANNING BUDGET CUT DENOUNCED AS 'CALLOUS' ACTION  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian's deep cut in the state budget for family planning was  denounced Friday as a "callous and uncaring" action that could cost taxpayers  $265 million annually in expenses resulting from unintended pregnancies and  births.  </P> <P> The budget cut is expected to curtail or eliminate a wide array of services --  including examinations to detect cancer -- for 235,000 women who will have  nowhere else to turn for their care, the program's director said. In the Los  Angeles area alone, 35 clinics are expected to close.  </P> <P> Deukmejian's budget veto also represented a devastating blow to feminist groups  still reeling from Monday's U.S. Supreme Court decision giving states greater  leeway to regulate abortion. Family planning providers contended that  Deukmejian's action, ironically, will lead to thousands of additional abortions  for California women whose pregnancies could be avoided with proper  contraceptive care and counseling.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cuts Applauded by Some  </P> <P> But anti-abortion activists applauded the cuts as justified because, they said,  the state-supported clinics have failed to prevent pregnancies and instead have  relied increasingly on abortion as a form of birth control.  </P> <P> Some abortion opponents, including Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti  (D-Los Angeles), said the family planning program brought the budget cut on  itself. Roberti claimed that the clinics have encouraged abortions.  </P> <P> The $24.1-million cut sliced two-thirds from the $36.2 million the Legislature  had approved for the state Office of Family Planning for the 1989-1990 fiscal  year, which began July 1. This cut came even as Deukmejian approved 99% of the  Legislature's nearly $50-billion budget for all state operations, granting  budget increases to virtually every other major program.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Program Singled Out  </P> <P> Deukmejian addressed reporters in a brief news conference as he signed the  budget in his office Friday, but he declined to explain why he singled out the  family planning program for such a drastic cut.  </P> <P> A spokesman for the governor said the cut was needed to maintain the budget's  $1.1-billion "prudent reserve" for emergencies.  </P> <P> The only other clue to the rationale behind the governor's decision came  Thursday in Los Angeles when Deukmejian said in comments after a speech that  the family planning program had been ineffective and would be better funded by  private sources.  </P> <P> The Office of Family Planning, part of the state Health Services Department, is  best known for providing birth control services through contracts with private  organizations such as Planned Parenthood. Agencies that use the state money are  permitted to counsel pregnant women about abortion but may not use state funds  to pay for the procedure.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Other Services  </P> <P> But the family planning budget also provides other services for poor women,  including Pap smears to detect cervical cancer, breast exams and tests for  sexually transmitted diseases and the AIDS virus.  </P> <P> Last year, the program served 471,000 women through more than 500 clinics,  according to Jerome Hansen, director of the office. Hansen said the budget cuts  would most likely be distributed across the board by simply reducing the number  of women served.  </P> <P> "You've got 235,000 women who no longer have access to that care," Hansen said,  referring to the estimated number of people the program no longer will be able  to serve. "It's not clear where they're going to get that care, if they are."  </P> <P> Norma Clevenger, executive director of the Planned Parenthood Affiliates of  California, said the cuts will lead to more pregnancies and births among poor  women who will no longer be able to get birth control. She pointed to the  results of a University of California study concluding that for every $1 the  state spends on family planning, it saves $11 in other costs that would result  from unintended pregnancies and births.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'It's Ridiculous'  </P> <P> Under that formula, the $24.1-million cut would amount to about $265 million in  added costs to the state.  </P> <P> "It's ridiculous to assume that this action is going to do anything except  increase the need for abortions in this state," Clevenger said. "It is callous  and uncaring."  </P> <P> In the Los Angeles area, the cuts are expected to force the closure of 35  private, nonprofit clinics, said Gary Wallach, assistant director of the Los  Angeles Regional Family Planning Council. Wallach predicted that the cuts will  lead to 65,000 additional California pregnancies in the next year and 35,000  added abortions.  </P> <P> "This is going to mean a whole lot more unwanted children, and a lot of  unhappiness in families," Wallach said. "You're going to have more child abuse,  more drugs, more people in jail. That's the syndrome we've been trying to  stop."  </P> <P> But Brian Johnston, Western director of the National Right to Life Committee,  an anti-abortion group, said programs such as Planned Parenthood have failed to  stop unwanted pregnancies and have instead advocated abortion as a form of  birth control.  </P> <P> "If they want to get out of the abortion industry, they will get us off their  backs," Johnston said. "If they were willing to separate abortion from family  planning they would not be in this predicament."  </P> <P> Senate Leader Roberti, an otherwise liberal Democrat who opposes abortion for  religious reasons, said he believes that Deukmejian cut "deeper than he had to"  into family planning. But Roberti suggested, as did Johnston, that the family  planning agencies brought the problem on themselves.  </P> <P> "I think family planning would have much more across-the-board support if they  totally got out of the abortion business," Roberti said. "I could then myself  categorically say the governor was dead wrong."  </P> <P> Roberti and Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) said they hoped to  negotiate with Deukmejian to have at least part of the family planning budget  restored.  </P></p>

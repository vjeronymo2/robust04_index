			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> GUITARIST GREGORY ON RIGHT COURSE  </P> <P> One of the Los Angeles Jazz Society's annual tributes is a Shelly Manne  Memorial Award given to a new talent. The most recent winner, guitarist Steve  Gregory, was heard Sunday at the Society's weekly "Windows on Hollywood" brunch  in the Holiday Inn.  </P> <P> Gregory, 26, is still a student at Cal State Northridge; his bassist, Trey  Henry, and drummer David Tull, are CSN graduates. Because all three have often  worked together in several contexts, what was heard Sunday rose at times above  the conventional jam session level.  </P> <P> True, some of the numbers were predictable, but Gregory's workouts on "Autumn  Leaves" and "No Greater Love" displayed his assertively fluent style on a solid  body guitar, alternating between long single note lines and occasional bursts  of well-timed chords.  </P> <P> Of special interest was his version of Monk's "Straight No Chaser," for which  he rearranged the length of the tune's already quirky phrases so that they  became doubly eccentric. The trio's repertoire also boast a few original works.  "Jazz Brunch," composed for this occasion by Gregory, opened stealthily with a  vamp spelled by a series of drum breaks before stating its well-crafted theme.  "Extrovert," by bassist Henry, was a buoyant showpiece for the unit.  </P> <P> New music aside, what's laudable about musicians like Gregory, Henry and Tull  is that they know such songs as "My One and Only Love" and "Yardbird Suite,"  and can play them in 1990 without seeming either antiquated or condescending.  Gregory's technical finesse and imagination have set him on the right course,  one that will surely establish his firmly in the new non-synthesized generation  of true believers.  </P></p>

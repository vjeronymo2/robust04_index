			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MORE U.S. TROOPS ORDERED TO GULF;  </P> <P> MIDEAST: PENTAGON SOURCES SAY NEW REINFORCEMENTS COULD NUMBER MORE THAN  100,000.  </P> <P> President Bush said today that he has ordered a new wave of U.S. troops to the  Persian Gulf area to give the multinational military force there an "adequate  offensive military option should that be necessary."  </P> <P> The President's announcement at a White House news conference did not specify  how many more American forces will be added to Operation Desert Shield, but  Pentagon sources said it could be more than 100,000.  </P> <P> The sources said the extra troops will include armored divisions from U.S.  bases in Germany and possibly from the United States.  </P> <P> Bush said he does not need to get U.N. approval to launch a military action  against Iraq but indicated that the Administration will first seek out that  support.  </P> <P> "Yes, we have the authority but we've been great believers in going to the  United Nations," Bush said in a question-and-answer session after his  announcement.  </P> <P> Bush said he still holds out hope that the confrontation over Iraq's invasion  and occupation of Kuwait can be settled short of war. But he also said he wants  to give the American ground commander in Saudi Arabia, Gen. H. Norman  Schwarzkopf, a credible offensive option.  </P> <P> "I would love to see a peaceful resolution to this question and that's what I  want," the President said as Defense Secretary Dick Cheney stood nearby.  </P> <P> The Soviet Union today again gave its qualified approval to the use of military  force to push Iraqi occupiers out of Kuwait if peaceful measures fail.  </P> <P> Secretary of State James A. Baker III came to Moscow seeking at least Soviet  acquiescence to the Bush Administration's intention of having the U.N. Security  Council authorize the use of force to liberate Kuwait as a last resort.  </P> <P> "Whether or not the use of force could be ruled out -- probably this could not  be ruled out -- and a situation may emerge which effectively would require such  a move," Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said after talks with  Baker.  </P> <P> Shevardnadze stressed that any decision to use force against the Iraqis should  be taken by the United Nations. "We should not doubt the ability of the  Security Council to take wise and mature decisions," he said.  </P> <P> Baker also met with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev at his official  country residence outside the city and had sessions with Shevardnadze before  and after that meeting.  </P> <P> Meanwhile today, it was learned that Saddam Hussein has dismissed his military  chief of staff for opposing the occupation of Kuwait and analysts said the move  indicates growing dissension in his armed forces hierarchy.  </P> <P> The Iraqi army's Al Qadissiya daily reported that Lt. Gen. Nazir al Khazraji,  chief of staff since 1985, has been replaced by Gen. Hussein Rashid, commander  of the elite 120,000-strong Republican Guards force.  </P> <P> The newspaper did not say what happened to Khazraji or when he was dismissed.  </P> <P> But several Western military and intelligence sources said Khazraji had opposed  the Kuwait occupation. They also believe that Hussein may be seeking to  surround himself with relatives and loyalists as the standoff with the  multinational gulf force enters its fourth month.  </P> <P> A Western intelligence source said Rashid is a hard-liner in Iraq's Baath  Socialist Party who would be expected to support Hussein's policies. Rashid had  been Khazraji's deputy chief of staff for operations.  </P> <P> U.S. officials in Washington said Rashid is considered a "very competent"  commander who led an armored brigade in the 1980-88 war against Iran.  </P> <P> "It's very ominous," said Hans-Heino Kopietz, a former analyst with London's  International Institute for Strategic Studies who is now with Control Risks, an  international security firm in London.  </P> <P> "Khazraji's dismissal now is indicative of some opposition to (Hussein) within  the military," Kopietz said.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Quinton Chan and Dick Chan] </F>   [Text] The government yesterday rejected a call from  Beijing to withdraw the partial political reform bill from the  Legislative Council, despite China's offer to resume talks with  Britain if this was done. Chief Secretary Anson Chan Fang  On-sang said it was impossible to hold up the bill. "I was  extremely pleased to hear the door to resumed negotiations  between the Chinese and the British was not closed," she said.  "But I don't think there is any possibility of the Governor  withdrawing the first-stage amendment bill."    The Foreign Ministry in Beijing said a formal message was  sent to Britain last Wednesday saying talks would only be  resumed if the bill submitted to the Legislative Council last  month was withdrawn. "The door to Sino-British negotiations is  open, but it hinges upon the attitude of the British side," said  the statement, carried by Xinhua (the New China News Agency).  But Mrs Chan said tabling talks was the only way to allow the  more controversial aspects of the reforms to be tackled. "We  are ready to meet with the Chinese at any time convenient to  them, so we can resume talks and arrive at an agreement," she  said.    Meanwhile, Beijing's new think tank on Hong Kong's political  future will discuss this week whether or not there should be new  elections for the three tiers of administration after 1997.  Local members of the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC)  political sub- group said new polls might not be needed, and it  was unlikely a PWC meeting in Beijing on Friday and Saturday  would reach any conclusions. The news comes days after the Hong  Kong and Macao Affairs Office announced the Legislative Council,  the two municipal councils, and the district boards would be  "disbanded" and "re- established" after 1997 because of the  breakdown in Sino-British talks. But PWC member Xu Ximin said  the definition of "re- established" was open to interpretation.  "It could mean new elections or some kind of confirmation  procedure," he said. Fellow member Professor Lau Siu-kai said  the PWC should first discuss whether there would be any form of  "through train" for members of the Urban Council, Regional  Council and district boards. "If there was a through train for  them, then it would reduce political uncertainty and gain the  support of district leaders," he said.    It is understood that at least four options have already  been  considered for the future political structure. These include  the appointment of a provisional assembly to take office after  the change of sovereignty, or a postal ballot to be held before  1997. Maverick lawyer Liu Yiu-chu has proposed the Preparatory  Committee for the Special Administrative Region, to be set up in  1996, elect legislators qualified to serve after 1997. "It  would not require new elections, respects the choice of the  people, and shows the sovereignty of the mother country," she  said. But Professor Lau said he thought the most likely option  was a three- to six-month recess to allow fresh elections. "Law  and order could be maintained under the existing structure," he  said. "This would be acceptable to Hong Kong people, and would  avoid anyone making use of the legislative vacuum to pass harsh  laws, or trying to expel someone from office."    Other, more radical, options include either the future chief  executive of the Special Administration Region or the National  People's Congress taking control of the legislature during the  first few months after the handover. Professor Lau said all the  options had disadvantages, since they offered the potential for  a great deal of interference from Beijing during the period just  after China resumes sovereignty.</p>

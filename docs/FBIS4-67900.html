			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by political commentator Nikhil Chakravartty] </F>   [Text] The U.S. has a whole battery of think tanks with an  enormous amount of material at their disposal. And these think  tanks are supposed to help in the moulding of public opinion and  Government policies. And yet, when it comes to the actual  application of policies, the U.S. Administration has been  displaying an amazing lack of coherent thinking and mature  understanding of the impact of its policies on the rest of the  world. It has hardly covered itself with glory in Somalia nor  has Bosnia added a feather on its cap.    In this rather messy background, the Deputy Secretary, Mr.  Strobe Talbott's Indo-Pak safari last week has been a rather  pedestrian exercise without an indication of any fresh thinking  on South Asia. Granted that he was far more cautious and  sophisticated than his impulsive under-secretary, Mr. Talbott's  visit has been no path-breaking achievement. Mr. Talbott came,  saw but hardly conquered.    In New Delhi, he bravely tried to assure that Washington  intends ``to cultivate good relations with India for the sake of  that relationship and to do the same with Pakistan.'' In other  words, New Delhi should not be concerned with what Washington  would be doing with Islamabad. Consequently, it is not India's  business to bother about what the U.S. would be giving or  denying to Pakistan: That should be treated as a bilateral  issue between two countries, just as Pakistan should treat any  Indo-U.S. deal as of no consequence for itself. On paper this  sounds like good logic, but in reality it is naive indeed. The  strategic importance of Pakistan in the Pentagon's future  projections in Central Asia and the Persian Gulf zone has hardly  gone down even after the end of the Cold War. The potential  turbulence that stretches from Xinjiang to Iran calls for a U.S.  foothold in this region, and that is what Pakistan can provide.    During Mr. Talbott's talks, there was a feeling in New Delhi  that the ingenious formula--offering of F-16s in exchange for  Islamabad agreeing to cap its nuclear weapons programme--would  be a nonstarter as no Government in Pakistan would agree to give  up its nuclear weapons programme. However, after his Islamabad  talks--which he described as a ``total success''--it is becoming  clear that what the Clinton Administration is immediately  concerned with is the disposal of the F-16 fleet along with  other lethal items for which the one-time waiver of the Pressler  Amendment is being pressed in the U.S. Congress.    The immediate compulsion of the Clinton Administration is to  sell the product of the giant aircraft and missile manufacturers  in the U.S. Senator Pressler has already exposed this with  regard to the F-16 offer to Pakistan. And if Mr. Narasimha Rao  is willing, President Clinton will readily offer to sell another  consignment of aircraft to India. Let us not forget the rumpus  over our cryogenic rocket deal with Russia which was bullied to  go back on its contract to make room for the promotion of the  American rocket products. And now the pressure is being mounted  on New Delhi to abandon its missile programme. ``If you need  rockets or missiles, we are ready to sell our stuff, why make  yours'' seems to be the latest jingle in the U.S. arms bazaar.    The question arises: What about the widely advertised  mission to cap Pakistan's nuclear weapons programme? In New  Delhi, Mr. Talbott elaborated on the deal with Pakistan as ``an  equation'' with ``strict unambiguous conditionality''--of which  one half is the release of F-16s and the other half is  ``agreement in advance to a veritable cap'' on Pakistan's  nuclear programme. Two days later at Islamabad, he threw more  light. In carefully worded comments it was stated that the U.S.  and Pakistan have agreed to go in for ``further consideration''  of the U.S. proposal. And this joint effort would be for  ``developing our approach'' to the equation. And for all that  only a ``preliminary accord'' has been reached. And when  further consideration was completed and ``an approach'' was  developed, then they would come to produce the goal of capping,  then reducing and finally eliminating nuclear weapons. A fairly  protracted process which may even outlive the Clinton  Administration. But the supply of F-16s would be immediate.    In New Delhi, Mr. Talbott sought to underplay the issue of  F-16s as having only ``a potent symbolism'' in the South Asian  region and urged the need ``to look beyond symbolism to  reality.'' However, such pseudophilosophical profundities can  hardly conceal reality. With protocol politeness Mr. Narasimha  Rao had to gently warn Mr. Talbott that the supply of F-16s  would be a matter of serious concern for our defence and this  would compel the Government to go in for counter-measure  jeopardising Indian economy.    The nonproliferation drive of the U.S. Administration hardly  impresses the Third World. Behind the tenacious drive to disarm  Iraq and current threats to North Korea, as also the pressure on  India and Pakistan to abandon the nuclear option, there is a  clear move to perpetuate the dominance of the nuclear powers  over those countries which are denied these weapons--the very  basis of the NPT [Nonproliferation Treaty].    Secondly, Washington's calculation that if Pakistan could be  cajoled to agree to cap its nuclear weapons programme then it  will be possible to persuade India to follow suit, is made  invalid by fact that the nuclear threat to India does not come  from Pakistan alone but also and more seriously from China, and  now from other Central Asian countries particularly Kazakhstan  which has a portion of the huge nuclear stockpile of the former  Soviet Union. And why should India leave out the danger of  nuclear threat from Israel which had once made a sneaking attack  on Pakistan's nuclear arsenal at Kahuta? So, if one is really  serious about dispelling Indian threat perception, one has to  extend much beyond a two-country arrangement between India and  Pakistan, or even the latest version of 5+2+2 (i.e., the five  permanent members of Security Council including China, plus  Japan and Germany along with India and Pakistan) that is heavily  weighed against India.    Thirdly, the Indian perception is that the nuclear powers  are  not serious about reversing the nuclear arms race towards  nuclear disarmament. Had they been genuinely serious about  nuclear disarmament, then why did they not readily respond to  Rajiv Gandhi's initiative when he placed before the UN special  session in 1988 a detailed and realistic Action Plan--which was  updated by Mr. Narasimha Rao in his intervention before the  special session of UN Security Council in 1993? There has  always been a condescendingly polite appreciation of the Indian  initiative without any effort at any serious follow-up  discussions by the big bosses of the nuclear corporate club.    Here is a foretaste of the new form of world overlordship  through nuclear monopoly of a select group of powers with the  U.S. at the head, and to ensure economic domination through  control of world trade as GATT represents, in which  discrimination is sought to be practised even through  non-economic means. In this context, the arms sale is first on  the priority list for the U.S. The message is clear for all VIP  visitors to Washington: Don't bother to make your own weapons,  that is only a fetish. Instead, buy it from us.</p>

			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> The U.S. Information Agency has decided not to appeal a pivotal court ruling  that found the agency violated constitutional guarantees of free speech by  denying export certificates to a group of documentary films that espoused  liberal views opposed by the Reagan administration. The much-publicized 1986  case pitted seven film makers, whose on-screen topics range from Nicaragua  under the Sandinistas to the perils of nuclear energy, against the USIA and its  former director, Charles Z. Wick. The agency refused to certify the films for  export, and the film makers charged that the agency was attempting to censor  the films' contents. The agency's criteria for determining suitability for  export certification were challenged in Los Angeles federal court and found  unconstitutional. That ruling was appealed and upheld in higher courts. The  agency this week chose not to take the case to the U.S. Supreme Court. (A  related legal matter over a second set of USIA guidelines is still pending,  however.) ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

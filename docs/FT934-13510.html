			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Dasa plans closures and staff cuts to return to the black DEUTSCHE Aerospace (Dasa), the aircraft, defence and satellites division of Daimler-Benz, is to shut six German sites, shed non-core activities and make further heavy cuts in its workforce by the end of 1996. The restructuring will save the loss-making company DM1.5bn (Pounds 611m) a year, Mr Jurgen Schrempp, chairman, claimed yesterday. The aim was to return to profit in 1995. Turnover this year would be DM1.2bn lower than the DM16bn originally envisaged, he said, and new orders would be DM3bn down. Mr Schrempp, a dogged defender of the Eurofighter joint venture, has often complained of lack of support from Bonn. A new report on the four-nation warplane venture by the national audit office, due to reach the defence ministry soon, criticises the project for poor management and excessive costs. 'But the question remains whether and to what extent those people who have an essential influence on the economic and political environment are prepared to make their contribution to the continuance of the aerospace industry in Germany,' he said. Dasa's defence sales, which in 1991 accounted for 50 per cent of turnover, generate only 27 per cent now. Federal spending on military hardware of DM12bn a year in 1990, is scheduled to fall to DM6bn next year. Two of the sites earmarked for closure are part of Dasa's Airbus commercial airliner business, the other four are all defence-related. Company executives said only 120 Airbuses would be built next year, compared with original plans for 216. Businesses scheduled for disposal are believed to include Dornier medical technology, while Dasa is to attempt to bolster its guided missiles arm through a joint venture with France. The company already has close links with Aerospatiale. News of the cuts immediately stirred protests, notably from the government of Lower Saxony, where Dasa's Lemwerder aircraft maintenance site, employing 1,136, is to close. Dasa workers' councils are also understood to be angry over alleged lack of consultation.</p>

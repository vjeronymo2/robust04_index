			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Advisory Committee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Technical Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Standards Committee (THLPSSC), consisting of 15 members, was established by statute to consider the feasibility, reasonableness, and practicability of proposed pipeline regulations. RSPA implemented the committee balloting process by mail. After initial balloting, the process allowed each member to review the ballots, including comments, of all other members, and to change his or her vote or initial comment if desired. Although some THLPSSC members did not vote on every proposed change, a tally of the second ballots showed that a large majority of THLPSSC members found all the proposed changes technically feasible, reasonable, and practicable. Nonetheless, in developing the final regulations, RSPA considered all final THLPSSC votes and comments, including minority positions. The following discussion explains how RSPA treated THLPSSC positions and public comments on the proposed amendments in developing the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Changes to Part 195 Safety Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following discussion explains the changes to various standards in part 195:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 195.1&blank;Applicability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Offshore production. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Part 195 does not apply to pipelines used in offshore production, whether on the Outer Continental Shelf or in state offshore waters. However, this exception is clearly stated in part 195 only for production on the Outer Continental Shelf (&sect;195.1(b)(5)). To clarify that all offshore pipelines used in production are outside part 195, RSPA proposed to delete from &sect;195.1(b)(5) the phrase ``on the Outer Continental Shelf''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 10 THLPSSC members who voted on the proposed amendment to &sect;195.1(b)(5) all approved the amendment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, RSPA received comments from three operators and two pipeline-related associations in support of the amendment and no adverse comments. Therefore, &sect;195.1(b)(5) is amended as proposed in the NPRM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We also requested comments on whether there is a gap in the regulation of production lines in state offshore waters. Only one commenter responded. This commenter opined that existing state and federal programs adequately regulate production lines in state waters. In Louisiana, the Departments of Natural Resources and Environmental Quality were said to have comprehensive regulations on facility installation, operation, integrity, and removal, and sufficient authority to address any ``gap'' that is identified. Since the other states with production lines in state waters have similar regulations, RSPA does not believe there is a gap in the regulation of production lines in state waters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In-plant piping. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Part 195 does not apply to pipeline transportation through onshore production, refining, or manufacturing facilities, or storage or in-plant piping systems associated with such facilities (&sect;195.1(b)(6)). Because the physical distinction between a regulated pipeline serving a plant and unregulated in-plant piping is unclear, RSPA proposed to add a definition of ``in-plant piping system'' to &sect;195.2. The definition proposed was: `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In-plant piping system <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  means piping that is located on the grounds of a plant and used to transfer hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide between plant facilities or between plant facilities and a pipeline, not including any device and associated piping that are necessary to control pressure in the pipeline.'' The NPRM explained that we would consider in-plant piping to extend to the plant boundary in the absence of a necessary pressure control device on plant grounds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All ten THLPSSC members who voted on this proposal supported it. However, four members believed that because the NPRM primarily concerned pipeline transportation rather than production, refining, or manufacturing plants, it did not give plant owners adequate notice that the proposed definition could affect plant piping. These members wanted RSPA to publish a separate NPRM on the subject of in-plant piping.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

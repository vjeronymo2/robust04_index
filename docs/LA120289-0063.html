			<p><P> December 2, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL PREVIEWS;  </P> <P> FRONTIER LEAGUE  </P> <P> Agoura  </P> <P> COACH: Kevin Pasky, 3rd season  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 9-11 overall; 3rd in league, 7-3  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: Sean Martin (5-10) is a fundamentally complete, creative  off-guard who, as was the case last season, will be responsible for the bulk of  the Chargers' scoring. In fact, Pasky has given Martin's job as point guard to  senior Brian Miller (5-9), just so there's no chance of Martin's arms tiring  from dribbling the ball: He is going to shoot that much. Miller averaged 16.2  points a game last season. Senior center Tony Marko (6-5) and sophomore forward  Eddie Corridori (6-2) figure to pick up some of the scoring chores. Pasky said  that he expects 10 points and 10 rebounds from Marko, "the most improved player  in the program," according to Pasky. Corridori averaged 16 points a game as a  freshman and was named the junior varsity's most valuable player. Senior Gino  Corridori (6-1), Eddie's brother, will start at the other forward. Others  expected to contribute are senior forward Bryce Arledge (6-3), senior guard Joe  Marini (5-11), junior forward Diego Edber (6-2) and senior guard Mark Kelly  (5-10), the only player other than Martin with varity experience. Agoura's  weakness is, well, weakness; the Chargers have size but not much bulk.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: Could this be the season that Agoura challenges Santa Clara, which has  won nine of the past 10 league championships and last season's 2-A Division  state title? Probably not, but Pasky remains positive. "I think we'll be  competitive with them," he said. "In the four years I've been at Agoura, this  is the best varsity team we've had." As was the case last season, the Chargers  probably will need to beat Nordhoff for second place. This season, Calabasas  also could be a factor.  </P> <P> Calabasas  </P> <P> COACH: David Hoffman, 2nd season  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 9-12 overall; 4th in league, 4-6  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: Jim Friedlander, Greg Waugh, Dan Feldman, Jason Young and Tom  Hoover all started several games last season for Hoffman, who was in his first  season. They're all back and that should make for a much-improved Coyote team.  Friedlander (6-3), who averaged 12.5 points and five assists as a forward last  season, has been moved to the point. Waugh (6-7), a senior center, and Young  (5-10), a junior guard, also scored about 10 points a game. Waugh contributed  more than five rebounds a game. Young recently had surgery on his knee and is  not expected back until the start of league play. Mitch Chernow (6-3) figures  to fill in as a power forward. Feldman (6-4) is a senior forward and Hoover  (6-1) is a junior guard with a strong perimeter game. Hoover has Hoffman's  endorsement as the team's most improved player. That alone probably isn't good  enough to challenge the likes of Santa Clara, but Agoura and Nordhoff are  certainly within reach. Another player expected to help the Coyote cause is  forward Brian Ferring (6-2).  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: Calabasas might start slowly, but the Coyotes probably will improve as  the season progresses. Their early season schedule includes Crespi and  Chaminade, and they play in the Hart tournament. "You have to schedule  according to talent and experience," Hoffman said. "We have to face as much  quality competition as we can."  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As was explained in the proposed rule, SBA's present general practice, which is not proposed to be changed (and which SBA is extending to Participating Securities) is to extend invitations to Licensees to participate in the creation of a pool of SBA-guaranteed Debentures, against which a public offering of SBA-guaranteed trust or pool certificates, each evidencing a fractional interest in the pool, is made to long-term investors. Such pools are formed and certificates sold every three months, give or take a few days. Preceding the closing of the sale of the pool certificates there is a ten-day period during which no more Debentures may be considered for inclusion in the pool. During that ten-day period, the rate of interest on Debentures or of Prioritized Payments on Participating Securities is determined. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When a Licensee requests a draw, it will be deemed to have authorized SBA to guarantee its security immediately, and to have authorized SBA, acting as the Licensee's agent, to sell such security to a short-term investor that will agree to hold the Licensee's security until the Licensee's security is put into the next pool, or is repurchased by the Licensee, or is repurchased by SBA because of a definitive determination based on subsequently-received adverse information concerning the Licensee's credit or regulatory status. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the security is a Debenture, it will be sold to a short-term investor at a discount, calculated as if the maturity date of the Debenture were the next scheduled closing date for the sale of pool certificates. The Licensee will also agree to the payment of additional interest to the short-term investor, at the same rate used to calculate the discount, for each day that the sale of pool certificates is delayed beyond the scheduled date. While payment to the short-term investor of all interest accrued from the date of sale to the actual closing date shall be the responsibility of the Licensee, it shall be guaranteed by SBA. The Licensee's failure to make full payment of such additional interest shall constitute an event giving rise to a condition affecting the Licensee's good standing under SBA's regulations. If the Licensee's security is a Participating Security, the same conditions will apply, however, the Participating Security will be sold to a short-term investor at a price equal to the face amount thereof. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although SBA guarantees the Licensee's undertaking to the short-term investor concerning payment of interest on a Debenture or Prioritized Payments on a Participating Security on the date such Debenture or Participating Security is pooled, the Licensee does not warrant, nor does SBA guarantee, that pooling will take place on any specific date. The short-term investor assumes the risk that the recovery of its invested principal and the receipt of interest or Prioritized Payments will be delayed to the extent that the pool closing is delayed. Based on historical experience, it is unlikely that any such delay will occur and if it does, the duration of the delay should be minimal. The rate at which the Licensee's Debenture will be discounted or at which the Prioritized Payments will accumulate on a Participating Security when either of these securities are sold to a short-term investor will, in both cases, be determined with reference to the current average market yield on obligations of the United States with comparable periods to maturity. However, for the purpose of determining the rate of interest or of Prioritized Payments payable to a short-term investor, ``maturity'' refers to the next scheduled pooling date, not the stated maturity date of the security in question. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the normal course of events, when the sale of pool certificates closes, the Licensee's security will be included in the pool, having been purchased, as previously agreed, from the short-term investor with the Licensee's share of the proceeds of the sale of SBA guaranteed certificates issued against the pool. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The sale of the Licensee's security to a short-term investor with SBA's guaranty does not obligate SBA to include that security in a pool of long-term securities in disregard of subsequently-obtained information calling into question either the Licensee's financial soundness or the Licensee's compliance with applicable regulations. If SBA determines to withhold its guarantee of the Licensee's security to the pool, SBA will purchase the Licensee's security from the short-term investor on or before the pool closing date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sale of the Licensee's security to a short-term investor with SBA's guaranty does not cut off the Licensee's right to withdraw its security from entering into the pool by repurchasing it directly from the short-term investor if notice is given to SBA at least ten days prior to the pool cut-off date. However, since the sale of the Licensee's security to a short-term investor, and not the subsequent pooling of the security, is the event that discharges SBA from its reservation obligation to the extent of the security's face amount, the Licensee's subsequent repurchase of its security from the short-term investor does not re-obligate SBA under the terms of its commitment, or restore SBA's guarantee authority to the extent of the face amount of the repurchased security. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SBA's approval of an application for a commitment does not lock in any interest or Prioritized Payment rate, nor does SBA's guarantee of a security sold to a short-term investor indicate in any way what the Licensee's interest or Prioritized Payment rate will be when the security is pooled and certificates are sold to long-term investors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Once in the hands of the pool trustee, the Licensee's Debenture or Participating Security will assume all the terms and characteristics of the other securities in the pool, including an interest or Prioritized Payment rate recalculated with reference to the maturities of the other securities being pooled. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Compliance With Executive Orders 12866, 12612, and 12778, and With the Regulatory Flexibility and Paperwork Reduction Acts <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule will not constitute a significant regulatory action for the purposes of Executive Order 12866 because it is not likely to have an annual impact on the national economy of $100 million or more, and, for purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , it will not have a substantial impact upon a significant number of small entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The legal basis for this final regulation is section 308(c) of the Small Business Investment Act, 15 U.S.C. 687(c), and section 20(a)(2) of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 631 (note) as amended by section 414 of Pub. L. 102&hyph;366. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The potential benefits of this final regulation have been set forth in the discussion above, under Supplementary Information. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The potential cost of this final regulation cannot be quantified or estimated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. There are no Federal rules which duplicate, overlap, or conflict with this final rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. SBA is not aware of regulatory alternatives that could achieve the same objectives at lower cost. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule was not reviewed under Executive Order 12866. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12612 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> SBA certifies that this final regulation has no federalism implications warranting the preparation of a Federalism Assessment in accordance with Executive Order 12612. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12278 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the purposes of Executive Order 12278, SBA certifies that this final rule is drafted, to the extent practicable, in accordance with the standards set forth in Section 2 of that Order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final regulation will impose an additional record-keeping requirement on those Licensees that voluntarily avail themselves of the benefit of this final rule. Viewing the matter from the Licensee's standpoint, the additional burden of preparing a quarterly short-form financial statement is offset by the assurance of the future availability of Leverage and the reduction of cost resulting from elimination of the need to draw down Leverage funds long before they may be invested in Small Concerns. From SBA's standpoint, the additional record-keeping is necessary if SBA is not to rely upon out-dated financial information when its funds draws against its commitment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> [Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program No. 59.011 Small Business Investment Companies] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 13 CFR Part 107 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Investment companies, Loan programs-business, Reporting and record-keeping requirements, Small businesses. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons set forth above, part 107 of Title 13, Code of Federal Regulations is amended as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 107_SMALL BUSINESS INVESTMENT COMPANIES <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

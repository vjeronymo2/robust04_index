Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said Kliridhis asked  for time to study the draft document, and during talks tomorrow  [10 March] and the following day he will raise a number of  questions to clarify certain points. Kasoulidhis said the  president will brief political leaders on the draft document  during separate meetings tomorrow and the following day.    The spokesman said that the proximity talks are entering a  serious phase. Asked whether he agrees with the evaluation of  Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department special coordinator on  the Cyprus issue, that the CBM's are the first opportunity in  decades to find a Cyprus solution, Kasoulidhis said it is a  significant opportunity. The spokesman concluded by saying that  the Cypriot Government is in daily contact with the Greek  Government. [passage omitted]</p>

The application package must be submitted with OMB Standard Form 424 (Rev. 4&hyph;88, including 424A and 424B), with the required information filled in and the certified assurances included.

A supplemental sheet should be provided which presents a detailed breakdown of the proposed costs, as well as the costs which the applicant proposes to contribute in support of this effort, or any additional financial commitment made by other sources. The budget detail shall include all cost components of the project. Labor categories, hourly labor rates, and projected labor hours for each category should be included, as well as all materials, computer time, test facility fees, etc. For planning purposes, the required briefings, during the agreement performance period, will be conducted at NHTSA in Washington, D.C. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.

			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Observer: Sour note The Bank of China is not alone in upsetting people with its bank notes. The Bank of England has also put a few noses out of joint during the 300 years it has been printing the country's money, judging by Derrick Byatt's new book - Promises to Pay. Getting the Queen's picture right seems to have been particularly tricky. Professor Robert Austin was taken to task in the 1950s by Lord O'Brien, then chief cashier, for giving the Queen too much hair, too full a chest, a pinched chin and a left eye which did not seem to be looking in the correct direction. Another of Austin's designs was dismissed by Harold Wilson as 'more like a ticket on a detergent (gift) voucher' than a bank note. Worried by the criticism, the Bank invited Sir Anthony Blunt to join its informal design panel only to find some years on that Blunt was a Russian spy.</p>

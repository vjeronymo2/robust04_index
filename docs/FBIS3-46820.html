			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Traitorous `Civilian'-Veiled Group Shunning Fellow </F> Countrymen and Depending on Outside Forces"--KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, January 6 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today  comes out with an article denouncing the Kim Yong-sam puppet  clique for sticking to the policy of thinking more of outside  forces than of fellow countrymen and depending on those forces,  while ignoring the priniciple of national independence, the  basic principle in the settlement of the reunification question.    The author of the article says:    Kim Yong-sam, taking office, said that no outside forces  could "be better than the nation." This was, however, an empty  talk to cheat and flout the people.    This is proved, first of all, by the fact that his clique  intends to leave South Korea under foreign domination and yoke  indefinitely, begging of outside forces "protection" and  "security assistance."    Whenever the traitor Kim Yong-sam met with his U.S. master,  he implored for a permanent U.S. military occupation of South  Korea, saying that U.S. troops must not be withdrawn from there.  He even committed himself to a greater burden share for the  maintenance of the aggressor forces in return for the shelving  of the "U.S. troop cutback plan."    His clique describes the U.S. troops present in South Korea  as "a war deterrent" and extols them as "apostles of peace."    The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique's dependence on outside  forces  finds another graphic expression in the fact that it is seeking  North-South confrontation in collusion with outside forces while  refusing to join hands with fellow countrymen who call for a  solution of the problem of peace and peaceful reunification of  the country with the concerted effort of the nation.    On the pretext of the "nuclear problem" of the North, the  Kim  Yong-sam puppet government broke up the North-South dialogue and  exchange which had taken place under the "fifth and sixth  republics".    It frequently staged large-scale nuclear war exercises  including the Team Spirit joint military maneuvers in an attempt  to put the brake on the progress of the DPRK-USA talks for the  solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula.  Especially, the puppets ran amok to establish an "international  cooperation system" and have "sanctions" taken against fellow  countrymen.    For the establishment of the "international cooperation  system," they even opened the rice market of South Korea to the  U.S. master, wiped off the slate Japanese imperialists' crimes  in their invasion of Korea in the past and defended Japan's  nuclear armament and overseas expansion.    With this traitorous "government" and traitor left intact in  South Korea, national unity and peaceful reunification are  impossible and the nation inevitably falls a victim to outside  forces.    The South Korean people will never tolerate the traitorous  "government" of Kim Yong-sam turning the back on the nation and  depending on outside forces.</p>

According to Askar Akayev's expert on world politics, the  possibility of his country's joining the program is being  studied, and "the approach to it is very cautious," since  Bishkek is bound by its commitments in the framework of  collective security treaties signed with CIS countries.    As INTERFAX learned from the chief of the Kyrgyz Defence  Ministry's press center, Lt.-Colonel Akzhal Isayev, his ministry  has not determined its attitude to the NATO program yet, since  the military are not acquainted with it.</p>

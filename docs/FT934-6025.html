			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Royal Bank shares rise on Direct Line advance Direct Line, the Royal Bank of Scotland's private insurance subsidiary, became the largest private motor insurer in the UK in the year to September 30, while more than trebling pre-tax profits to Pounds 50.2m, against Pounds 15.1m. Gross premium income was almost doubled at Pounds 409.5m (Pounds 213.2m). It doubled the number of active private motor policies to 1.25m (670,000) and said it had set a target of writing 1m new motor policies in the coming year. Total assets grew to Pounds 567.9m (Pounds 304.3m) while shareholders' funds rose by Pounds 86.3m to Pounds 168m. The capital increase included an additional Pounds 53m injected by Royal Bank in addition to the Pounds 120m injected since Direct Line was founded. The company achieved more modest growth in household insurance, increasing policies to 273,000 (206,000). It has developed new risk profiles and is now selling household policies as fast as motor policies two years ago. Mr Peter Wood, chief executive, said it could undercut competitors because it had had a 10.2 per cent ratio of expenses to premium income for motor policies, compared with an estimated industry average of 27 per cent. Mr Wood said that Direct Line had experienced 'truly an outstanding and satisfying year'. He said the results showed that critics were incorrect to assert that lower pricing of insurance policies would lead to poorer service. The number of staff rose to 1,873 at the year end from 1,086. The company opened a new office in Birmingham, and expanded in Glasgow. A fifth regional office is due to be opened in Leeds by the end of this year. A Direct Line Financial Services arm was launched in the first half of the year, offering personal loans and mortgages among other products. Its results are to be consolidated in Royal Bank's figures which will be released next week. Mr Wood said there was no conflict between the financial services operation and other Royal Bank operations because there was only a 5 per cent overlap between the two sets of customers, and this figure was 'getting less'. Royal Bank shares closed 22p up at 375p.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 22 Apr (INA)--The newspaper AL-THAWRAH has  urged Arab and friendly countries to be the first ones to break  the blockade and contribute to its fragmentation in honor of  their relationship with Iraq and in harmony with the legitimate  humanitarian aspiration for a world free of problems.    In an article today entitled "The New Iraqi Move...the  Timing  and the Response," the paper says: A policy of isolation,  oppression, and inflicting harm does not befit the relations  that should prevail among states. Peace and justice alone befit  good neighborliness, understanding, the exchange of legitimate  interests, and an open ear to all viewpoints without exception.    The paper adds: The new Iraqi move stems from clear  realities  whose starting point is the fact that Iraq has fulfilled its  commitments and its political and procedural pledges regarding  the Security Council resolutions. This was documented in the  recent Security Council deliberations. The paper explains that  while reminding the Arab brethren and foreign friends of the  division in the Security Council, Iraq is looking forward to the  political conduct that the United Nations should adopt in  harmony with its goals stipulated in the second article of the  UN Charter and also in harmony with the world declaration on  human rights, especially since this blockade has inflicted grave  damage on the Iraqi people.    AL-THAWRAH adds that the blockade has caused many tragedies  and a great deal of grief for the Iraqi people, which can under  no circumstances be acceptable and which can only be interpreted  as seeking to inflict deliberate harm. The paper emphasizes  that the blockade has inflicted grave damage on the Iraqi  people, and that international will should rise against this  situation if it actually respects its own credibility and if it  really honors the principles of justice and fairness it is  seeking. Otherwise, remaining silent on what happened will only  be regarded as encroachment on this credibility and a flagrant  violation of these principles.    Concluding, AL-THAWRAH says: We can fairly say that there  has been a measure of Arab and world response to the new Iraqi  move. The statements made by Arab and foreign leaders after  their meetings with President Saddam Husayn's envoys expressed  real understanding of Iraq's proposals, and are a positive sign  to be added to many positive signs in the international arena.  These signs indicate that the end to the blockade must come  soon.</p>

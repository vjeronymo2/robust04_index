			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> POLL BY DOCTOR SHOWS MDS OBJECT TO TACTICS OF ABORTION PROTESTERS  </P> <P> Like many doctors, Christopher Khoury had remained mostly silent in the  continuing debate over abortion. But the Escondido psychiatrist took a step  toward activism shortly after 130 demonstrators were arrested during a July 8  anti-abortion protest at a Poway women's clinic.  </P> <P> Khoury, an acquaintance of the doctor targeted during that protest, decided to  poll Palomar Medical Center's 252 staff doctors on the increasing targeting of  medical facilities for anti-abortion protests.  </P> <P> Khoury persuaded 20 fellow staff members at Palomar to circulate a memo that  calls for "the police and courts to respond humanely but promptly and  effectively to bring this form of violence to a halt." The memo described  abortion protests held at medical offices and clinics as "totally  inappropriate" behavior.  </P> <P> Of 162 doctors who responded to the memo, 85% agreed that the emotionally  charged protests illegally infringe upon the private relationship enjoyed by  doctors and patients. More than 10% abstained, but only 3% voiced outright  disagreement.  </P> <P> Half of the doctors who agreed with Khoury requested anonymity, but 81 agreed  to make their objections publicly.  </P> <P> Doctors, who traditionally have remained silent on many public issues, "are  very sensitive about privacy and the patient-doctor relationship," Khoury said  Wednesday.  </P> <P> Khoury described recent abortion demonstrations as "relatively minor irritants"  to most physicians. But "the debate over abortion is going to occur much more  publicly" following the recent Supreme Court ruling, Khoury said.  </P> <P> "The proper forum for the debate is not the doctor's waiting  </P> <P> room," Khoury said. "There have to be some rules as to how that debate will  take place."  </P> <P> William Boyce, a surgeon who has practiced in Escondido for 35 years, supported  Khoury because "you just don't enter people's properties (to) harass and  interrupt . . . what's going on. That's a most serious infraction."  </P> <P> Doctors might feel more comfortable remaining silent, but "they are affected by  all of the laws and social trends as much as everyone else," Boyce said  Wednesday.  </P> <P> Khoury was drawn into the growing public debate when 130 abortion protesters  were arrested after demonstrating at a Poway women's clinic operated by Dr.  Bruce J. Tarzy,a former Poway mayor. Tarzy, through a spokeswoman, on Wednesday  declined to comment on the informal survey because he had not yet seen the  results.  </P> <P> Khoury undertook the petition drive because "having public support like this  would mean a lot to physicians who have been victimized" by demonstrations.  Khoury described those doctors as being "harassed and essentially kidnaped" by  demonstrators.  </P> <P> "Those doctors go through hell," Boyce said. "They're in their private office,  and it's not a public building." He said the demonstrators are disturbing "a  very tender relationship between doctors and patients."  </P> <P> As a psychiatrist, Khoury has on several occasions counseled women who were  considering abortions to end what he described as pregnancies surrounded by  "tragic circumstances."  </P> <P> "I shared the difficult decisions they go through," Khoury said. "I believe  that . . . the woman should be making that decision without being harassed."  </P> <P> Hospital spokesman Alain Jourdier said Wednesday that Khoury acted in an  unofficial capacity when he polled staff members.  </P> <P> Earlier this week, the San Diego Medical Society announced that it "strongly  objects" to anti-abortion rallies being staged outside medical offices and  clinics. The society, which represents 2,800 of the county's 6,000 doctors,  "cannot condone . . . recent attempts to harass patients or prevent them from  seeking treatment," medical society President Lynn Sheffey said Monday.  </P></p>

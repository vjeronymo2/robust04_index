			<p><P> March 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TIME WARNER INC. TO PAY $225 MILLION FOR PUBLISHER OF SUNSET MAGAZINE  </P> <P> The owners of Sunset magazine, which has set the tone for Western living with  stories ranging from cooking tips to conserving wilderness, said Tuesday that  they had agreed to sell their publishing company to Time Warner Inc. for about  $225 million.  </P> <P> The agreement will end more than six decades of Lane family control of the  monthly magazine, which was originally founded by the Southern Pacific Railroad  in 1898 as a publicity tool to encourage travel to the West.  </P> <P> L. W. (Bill) Lane Jr. and Melvin B. Lane, co-chairman of Lane Publishing Co.,  which owns Sunset, began looking for a buyer last fall to ensure that the Menlo  Park, Calif.-based company's future and finance its growth, said spokesman Gene  Elsbree. "The important consideration is that Bill is 70 and Mel is 67," said  Elsbree of the brothers. "They have devoted their lifetimes to building Sunset  and they were concerned about its future."  </P> <P> Elsbree said that none of Lane's five grown children, who are stockholders and  approved the sale, were prepared to take over leadership of the company. "None  of them have the experience to take over a senior management position."  </P> <P> New York-based Time Warner, which will pay $80 million in cash and $145 million  in preferred stock for Lane, says it plans no major changes in management or  editorial content of Sunset, which has a circulation of 1.4 million. The Lane  brothers will serve as consultants to Time Warner after the sale.  </P> <P> "We see a great deal of potential there," said Time spokesman Peter Costiglio.  "We are really looking to have it grow even more."  </P> <P> The Lane's decision to sell to Time might have been influenced by a longtime  relationship with the company, which ranks as the world's largest media and  entertainment company after merging with Warner Communications last year.  </P> <P> L. W. Lane Sr., who bought Sunset in 1928 after moving to California to open an  office for Better Homes &amp; Gardens, had been good friends with Time magazine  founder Henry Luce. Sunset and the West Coast edition of Time also share  printing presses.  </P> <P> On Tuesday morning, the Lane brothers announced their decision to a group of  300 employees at Sunset's 16-acre headquarters complex, where adobe-walled  office buildings are set amid gardens representing the West's deserts as well  as its coastal forests.  </P> <P> "Our highest priorities have always been to maintain Sunset's editorial  excellence, to continue its growth and to ensure that the future of Sunset is  in the right hands," the Lanes said in a statement. "We're confident that these  will now be achieved."  </P> <P> The agreement to buy Sunset completes Time's plan to own regional magazines in  the growing Sunbelt region. Five years ago, Time bought Southern Progress  Corp., which publishes Southern Living magazine.  </P> <P> "Sunset magazine is a particularly attractive and vibrant property in a part of  the country of growing importance to our company," said Time Warner President  Nicholas J. Nicholas Jr. in a statement.  </P> <P> In buying Sunset, Time gains a name widely recognized in 13 Western states. The  magazine was one of the first to tailor its editorial content to separate  regions within its circulation area, and it is now published in four regional  editions.  </P> <P> Besides the magazine, Lane also publishes the widely popular Sunset Books -- on  gardening, home repair, cooking and other subjects -- and produces Sunset  Films.  </P> <P> Sales and profit figures for Lane Publishing were not released. But in a 1984  interview, William Lane said the company then had $80 million in revenue.  </P> <P> Sunset has focused its attention on five areas -- travel and recreation, home  design, food and entertainment, gardening and the environment -- and has proved  to be quite an influence on its readers.  </P> <P> Don Zimmerman, assistant general manager for Armstrong Garden Centers, said his  company often tries to stock up on items featured in the magazine. People come  in looking for certain products "because they read about it in Sunset," he  said.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beirut, 10 Mar (MENA)--President Husni Mubarak has  stated that he is confident that the current year will bring the  beginning of real peace. He said that any delay in the peace  talks is a "waste," noting that the Arab states have not called  for suspending the negotiations but for postponing them. He  pointed out that the Palestinian and Israeli leaders need peace  and that the peace process must move forward.    In an interview with the Lebanese magazine AL-HAWADITH,  President Mubarak stressed that cooperation is needed and is in  the best interest of all peoples. He noted that, despite the  animosity that existed between the French and the Germans, their  common interests dictated that they cooperate. In the  interview, President Mubarak described terrorists as "hired  criminals paid by some quarters that seek to cause unrest in  Egypt or any region." He noted that these quarters spend a lot  of money to carry out their plans. President Mubarak added that  the Hebron operation is sheer extremism, noting that extremism  exists in the United States, England, Australia, and elsewhere.    In his remarks to AL-HAWADITH chief editor Milhim Karam,  President Mubarak touched on the new world order, which he  described as "a chaotic order." He pointed out that it is  "wrong" to call it the new world order. He said that this order  is transitional and not the end of the road. As for the new  world order, he added, it will come when this chaotic order is  over.    Regarding Iraq, President Mubarak said: We are against  partitioning Iraq. Our position is clear and firm on this  matter. President Mubarak described Egypt's relations with Saudi  Arabia and all the Gulf states as "good and fraternal  relations." He described Egypt's relations with Lebanon and  Syria as "fully fraternal relations."    Turning to Egypt's relations with Russia, President Mubarak  said they are "good relations." He added: I do not wish to  antagonize any country. There is a problem with Iran, and it is  the one that seeks to antagonize Egypt. We have no relations  with Iran. We were about to exchange ambassadors a year ago,  but they disagreed among themselves.    Asked about the Hebron massacre and its impact on the peace  process, President Mubarak said that the massacre at the  al-Ibrahimi Mosque is an "appalling tragedy" that pained us all.  He added: But despite what happened and the difficulties  facing the negotiations, we believe that the peace process is  fundamental to the Palestinian people and the entire region.  President Mubarak expressed confidence that the peace process  will continue. He added: I know that the Palestinian and  Israeli leaders need peace and that extremists anywhere on earth  do not want that because they like to live in an atmosphere of  extremism. President Mubarak stressed that the peace process is  serious. He noted that despite the obstacles that exist, which  is natural in an issue that goes back 45 years, peace will come,  and the Palestinian issue is at the core of the conflict. He  expressed his belief that extremism in Israel will not triumph  and will not blow up the peace process, which is a just demand  by all peoples. He also expressed confidence that Lebanon and  Syria will reach a solution with Israel over the Golan and south  Lebanon.    Replying to a question on the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre's  impact on the Cairo Agreement, President Mubarak said he expects  the negotiations to resume soon after people have calmed down  and that the parties concerned will sign an accord now that they  have come so far. He added: I tell the Palestinians to put  their feet on the ground first and then make demands. He noted  that the Palestinian side is talking while it is outside its  land.    He stressed the need for cooperation and coordination  between  the Palestinians and the parties directly concerned with the  peace process and said: I have a duty to fulfill, which is  unifying the fold.    Commenting on Arab summits, he said that they are not held  annually and that Arab division after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait  resulted in a rift in the Arab world. He affirmed that he is  doing all he can to clear Arab air for the good of the nation.    Concerning Iraq, Mubarak said: We support the Iraqi people  and stand against partition. We are saddened by their suffering  because they are Arab Muslim people. (?Had) Saddam Husayn  (?heard) my sincere advice, it would not have happened, his  position would have been stronger, and Iraq's power would have  been a tributary for Arab strength.    On the situation in Algeria, he said: I hope our brothers in  Algeria under President Zeroual's regime will put an end to the  odious extremism that will destroy all the nation's resources.  If the parties concerned want the survival of their country,  they should sit with the Algerian president to discuss solutions  to end their problems.    Regarding the Lockerbie issue, President Mubarak said: We  have exerted enormous efforts, but the world today is  preoccupied with Bosnia and Somalia. I hope we will find a way  out for Libya to resolve the problem because the handover of the  two Libyan suspects is "difficult and sensitive."    Asked about the situation and challenges in Africa in his  capacity as current chairman of the OAU, President Mubarak noted  the numerous problems facing development there. He said  enormous efforts are necessary and that we are doing our best to  end the conflicts, which are "border disputes." He referred to  the problems in Liberia, Nigeria, Somalia, and Sudan.    He said that had the African countries adhered to the  African  summit's resolution in the 1960's, when the late Egyptian  President Jamal 'Abd-al-Nasir asked them to stick to the borders  left by colonialism.... [sentence incomplete as received]    Speaking about the Somali problem, President Mubarak said  that the African summit has entrusted a committee with the task  of ending this problem but there are difficulties in our way.  He added: We hosted in Egypt some of the rival parties with  the exception of General Farah Aidid who did not want to come.  Mubarak emphasized that as OAU chairman he does not take sides  with any party against another but that he speaks about all of  them with extreme fairness and neutrality. He said: We are  working for Somalia's unity and the Somali parties have to agree  among themselves so that their people can survive.    Asked about Sudan and the Hala'ib issue, President Mubarak  said: What is this Hala'ib? They want to fabricate a story with  us. They did so during the days of the late Presidents Anwar  al-Sadat and Jamal 'Abd-al-Nasir. Al-Turabi wants to create a  problem. They are free to do as they please but as for us we  have no problem.    President Mubarak stressed the need to launch a dialogue  between the north and the south and said it is unreasonable for  the north to live a very affluent life while the south lives at  subsistence level.    As for the Nonaligned Movement, Mubarak said: They are all  aligned. The small countries need the big ones to help them in  development. This is what brother Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi said  and he is right; everyone is aligned. But as for today, with  whom and against whom should alignment be? The Nonaligned  Movement is losing the reasons for its existence.    Asked about development in Egypt, the president noted the  great efforts that have been made to rebuild the infrastructure  and said: We have spent 100 billion pounds for this purpose.    On the effect of the acts of violence on tourism in Egypt,  President Mubarak said the number of tourists arriving in Egypt  has indeed decreased but Egypt, which has seven thousand years  of civilization, will not be affected by a group of terrorists  who have nothing to do with religion.</p>

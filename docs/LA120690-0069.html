			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> SERVING SUGGESTIONS AVOCADOS  </P> <P> Tired of that same old guacamole made from those ready-prepared spice packages  that you simply mix into mashed avocado?  </P> <P> Ventura resident Emily Thomson Beedy would like you to try her award-winning  recipe.  </P> <P> She recently took second place in the "Great Guacamole" cook-off at the  Escondido Avocado Festival.  </P> <P> "It's something I've always made and just kind of threw together without  following a recipe," she said. "So when I entered, I had to sit down and  actually write one out."  </P> <P> And what makes hers special?  </P> <P> "I guess the secret to the recipe is the cilantro and Tabasco sauce that I  use."  </P> <P> Beedy's Famous  </P> <P>  5 large ripe avocados (her recipe calls for the Hass variety)  </P> <P>  1 medium garlic clove, pressed  </P> <P>  1 tablespoon lemon juice, freshly squeezed  </P> <P>  1 tablespoon fresh cilantro, chopped  </P> <P>  1/2 teaspoon salt  </P> <P>  1/4 cup sour cream  </P> <P>  1/4 cup mayonnaise  </P> <P>  1/2 teaspoon (or to taste) Tabasco sauce  </P> <P>  Mash ripe avocados with pastry blender or fork. Add remaining ingredients and  mix. Serve garnished with additional cilantro if desired.  </P> <P> Proven far more versatile than just for guacamole or slivered for salad,  avocados can also be used to make a pie?  </P> <P> "Sure, it's real easy and tastes great," Beedy said.  </P> <P> Here's another Beedy suggestion:  </P> <P> Avocado Lime Pie  </P> <P>  2 large ripe avocados  </P> <P>  1 14-ounce can sweetened condensed milk  </P> <P>  rind of one lime  </P> <P>  1/2 cup lime juice  </P> <P>  2 egg yolks  </P> <P>  dash of salt  </P> <P>  1 9-inch graham cracker crust  </P> <P>  1 pint whipping cream  </P> <P>  Mash the avocado (should be about 2 cups). Mix milk, rind, juice, yolks and  salt. Stir until it thickens. Fold in avocado. Fill shell and chill several  hours. Whip the cream and top the pie.  </P></p>

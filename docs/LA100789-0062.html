			<p><P> October 7, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> WITNESS CLAIMS EX-ATHLETE SAID HE KILLED WOMAN  </P> <P> A key witness against a former high school star wrestler testified Friday that  the defendant admitted to killing one of the three people in Clairemont he is  charged with murdering.  </P> <P> Before a packed courtroom, Rodney Nicholson, 24, who said he also goes by the  name of Rodney Almond, testified that Christopher Box, 20, told him he had  stabbed April Gilhousen, 20, during a struggle in her home.  </P> <P> Also slain Aug. 9 were Gilhousen's 3-year-old son, Bryan, and Kevin Chandler,  29, who lived with Gilhousen. The bodies of the boy and Chandler were found in  separate locations on Clairemont Mesa Boulevard, and the woman's body was found  in her house.  </P> <P> The preliminary hearing for Box is likely to conclude next week. The audience  was filled with his friends from Clairemont High School, where he was a star  wrestler and football player.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Reminded of Oath  </P> <P> Nicholson, who is in jail on drug charges, came into the packed courtroom of  San Diego Municipal Judge Fred Link and initially told Deputy Dist. Atty.  Lorraine Rooney he could not see Box in the courtroom when asked to identify  him.  </P> <P> "Mr. Nicholson, you're under oath," reminded Rooney.  </P> <P> Rooney requested a private conference with Nicholson, and 10 minutes later,  Nicholson was escorted back into court and identified Box, saying he was "a  good friend of mine."  </P> <P> Nicholson said he was arriving at the house where the victims were killed when  he encountered Box outside with a baseball bat. He said Box had "a mean look on  his face" and hit him twice on the arm with the bat, causing severe pain.  </P> <P> He said Box ran after him but he eluded him and hid in a store. Nicholson said  he later hitched a ride to the house of a friend, Dennis Burns.  </P> <P> Some time later, Nicholson said, he, Burns and another man returned to the  house because Nicholson wanted to get his car back, which he had parked in the  alley.  </P> <P> While they were in the car, Nicholson said, he saw Box leave the house with  another man. Box's co-defendant, Manuel Flores Jr., 17, has a murder case  pending in Juvenile Court.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Apologized for Hitting  </P> <P> Nicholson said Box approached him in the car and apologized for hitting him.  </P> <P> "Sorry, home boy. I didn't know it was you. I thought it was somebody else,"  Nicholson quoted Box as saying.  </P> <P> Box told him he thought Nicholson was someone named Charles and that it  involved "a deal that went bad." Rooney asked Nicholson if Box meant a drug  deal, and the witness said he did not know.  </P> <P> Box gave Nicholson a $100 bill to pay for an X-ray, said Nicholson, and then  accompanied him to a store, he said. It was then that Box admitted to stabbing  April Gilhousen, Nicholson said.  </P> <P> "He said they got into an argument. He said she got stabbed," Nicholson said.  </P> <P> "Mr. Box told you he had killed April?" Rooney asked.  </P> <P> "Yes, to the best of my knowledge," replied the witness.  </P> <P> On cross-examination by Charles Adair, Box's lawyer, Nicholson added: "He  mentioned something about April coming at him with a knife, and a struggle, and  her being stabbed."  </P> <P> The prosecutor asked Nicholson if he had ever told police that Box remarked  that he had killed everyone in the house, but the witness said he couldn't  remember saying that.  </P> <P> The father of the slain boy, Michael Ross, testified that he once saw Box at  the house where the occupants lived, but he didn't know who he was at the time.  </P> <P> Box remains in County Jail in lieu of $2 million bail.  </P></p>

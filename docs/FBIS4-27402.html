			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Memorandum: Symbol of Solidarity Between Lao and Chinese </F> Armies"]    [Text] From 5 to 9 May this year, a high-level military  delegation of the Lao People's Democratic Republic [LPDR] led by  National Defense Minister Lieutenant General Choummali  Sai-gnason paid an official visit to the PRC. The visit was  aimed at further building and promoting the relations of  friendship and strengthening, ever more fruitfully, the  all-around solidarity between the two armies of Laos and China.  Recalling Lao-Chinese history, we see that Laos and China have  maintained relations with each other in many respects for a long  time. The two countries share a common border and maintain  similar customs. This is why the Chinese People's Liberation  Army [CPLA] and the Lao People's Army [LPA] have maintained the  traditional relations of friendship for a long time. Noteworthy  is that during the period of the national salvation struggle  against the imperialist aggressors, the Chinese army and people  always stood by the side of the Lao army and people in carrying  out the cause of struggle. In the visit to the PRC on this  occasion, the high-level military delegation of the LPDR  therefore intended to offer the CPLA pure friendship from the  LPA to jointly develop and further enhance the relations and  solidarity of fraternal friendship and comradeship.    During the four-day visit -- a very short visit, but in the  spirit of close friendship -- the high-level military delegation  of the LPDR was accorded a cordial welcome by the fraternal CPLA  side. The LPA delegation was welcomed in an honorable manner at  a solemn ceremony with the review of the guards of honor  organized by General Chi Haotian, national defense minister of  the PRC. The delegation was also accorded a warm welcome by  cadres, combatants, and state employees of many army units it  visited. The important thing, which served as a token of the  promotion and enhancement of the relations of friendship, was  the meeting between high-level military delegations of the two  countries. In the meeting, which proceeded in an atmosphere of  mutual understanding, the two sides reiterated in a  straightforward manner their readiness to flourish the blooming  solidarity and relations of fraternal friendship between the two  armies. The high-level military delegation of the LPDR also had  the honor to pay a courtesy call on General Liu Huaqing, member  of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and vice chairman  of the Central Military Committee, at the Government Guest Hall.  On that occasion, Gen. Liu Huaqing expressed pleasure at  welcoming the courtesy call of the LPA delegation. He also  expressed satisfaction over the increasing enhancement of the  relations of friendship between the parties, states, armies, and  peoples of the two countries. It was a great honor for the LPDR  delegation that Liu Huaqing, as a party leader, firmly  reiterated the determination to vigorously encourage all parties  concerned to do everything possible to strengthen the blooming  friendship relations with Laos under the present favorable  circumstances. On the occasion, Lt. Gen. Choummali Sai-gnason  informed Gen. Liu Huaqing of the outcome of the delegation's  visit. He also exchanged views with Gen. Liu Huaqing on many  issues amid an atmosphere of good mutual understanding.    Following the visit to the PRC on this occasion, the  high-level military delegation of the LPDR has profoundly  understood the economic growth and development of the PRC as a  result of the implementation of the open-door policy as  maintained by the CPC. The delegation has been impressed with  the welcome that was given, in a pure spirit of friendship, to  the Lao side by the Chinese side during the visit. Every place  the delegation visited, it was accorded a welcome in a sincere  manner. The Chinese side also explained in an open manner  useful lessons on educating, training, fostering, and managing  soldiers, which have been carried out by the CPLA. The four-day  period of the visit was therefore considered a dynamic period  for the already progressing relations between the two armies of  Laos and China. The high-level military delegation of the LPDR  highly assessed the friendship relations and all-around  cooperation between the two armies and expressed the conviction  that these relations and cooperation will be increasingly  developed and strengthened and will last forever.</p>

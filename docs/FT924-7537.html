			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Economics Notebook: Learning from September's currency crisis Mr Norman Lamont's Autumn Statement did nothing to dispel the growing impression that it will be a long time indeed before Britain rejoins the European exchange rate mechanism. But the chancellor and his advisers would be well advised to keep an eye on the ERM in the months ahead. For while there is now less UK enthusiasm for detecting ERM 'fault lines' and pressing for the system's fundamental reform, other members have started to draw lessons from September's crisis. If and when the UK returns, the ERM could be rather different to the system which Britain left on Black Wednesday. At the very least, realignment procedures will have to be overhauled to avoid any repetition of the events of September 12 and 13. That weekend Germany sought a broad realignment of currencies but the end result was a devaluation of the Italian lira only. Recent contacts between the Commons Treasury and Civil Service select committee and the Bundesbank have produced a plausible explanation as to how Mr Lamont and the Treasury could insist that Britain's EC partners did not seek a devaluation of sterling that weekend while the Bundesbank and German finance ministry thought that they had asked for this. It seems that the request was never passed on to London. Why not is a question that should be put to Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, chairman of the EC monetary committee and director-general of the French Treasury. It was his job on the Saturday to sound out the EC member states about a realignment after Bonn had initiated negotiations for such a move at the request of the Bundesbank. The reason for the apparent communications breakdown can only be guessed at. It may be that Mr Trichet did not understand Bonn's intention. Perhaps he had been convinced by the British government's earlier protestations that sterling would not be devalued. However, European monetary officials have also pointed out that the French franc would have been immediately in the firing line if sterling as well as the lira devalued that weekend. With the September 20 Maastricht referendum still a week away, it would have been difficult to fend off speculative attacks against the franc. The speculation against the ERM in September was unprecedented. Bundesbank intervention in support of the lira, sterling and French franc reached DM92bn (Pounds 38bn). In spite of the promises of a new openness in UK economic policy, we may never know the true scale of the Bank of England's efforts to prop up the pound. But they were huge. Foreign exchange dealers throughout the world found that the UK central bank was a ready buyer of sterling in the days of crisis leading to Black Wednesday. Indeed, as the crisis unfolded, banks in Germany were seen to be channelling their sales of sterling through London to the Bank rather than to the Bundesbank in Frankfurt. The flattering explanation for this phenomenon is that London is the world's premier foreign exchange centre and more efficient than Frankfurt. Another reason might be that the Bundesbank makes life a little bit harder for the speculator than does the Bank of England. The Bundesbank insists that banks selling foreign currency to it must have collateral in the form of securities on deposit with one Germany's state central banks. These securities are the 'Lombard' which German banks can also use as collateral for obtaining emergency liquidity from the Bundesbank. If a bank sells sterling to the Bundesbank, the transaction is counted against the Lombard to cover the settlement risk that arises in the two days between the Bundesbank handing over the D-Marks and accepting the foreign currency from the bank with which it does the deal. It is unclear in practice how much of a deterrent these rules are to the determined speculator. The Bank of England thinks that they do not make much difference. But the authorities in Frankfurt feel that it gave them an advantage in slowing the process of speculation compared with the Bank of England, which has no such system. Germany, like the UK, professes a firm belief in the freedom of financial markets and is a firm opponent of capital controls. But the temptation to throw some sand in the works of speculation was strong, not least because September crisis cost the Bundesbank dear. Some estimates put its potential losses at between DM1bn and DM2bn: an embarrassingly large sum when Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister, is expending political capital trying to reduce public spending and Germany's huge budget deficit. The losses have arisen because, under the rules of the European Monetary System, the Ecu is the denominator for operations in the EMS intervention and credit mechanisms and a means of settlement between the monetary authorities of the EC. During September's crisis, other central banks borrowed from the Bundesbank to support their currencies. To the extent that these debts are not denominated in D-Marks, they will be repaid in Ecu which have been devalued substantially by the large downward movements of the floating pound and lira since September 16. These losses - and Germany's dominance of the EMS since the crisis - will reinforce the determination of Frankfurt and Bonn to toughen up the rules by which the EMS operates. It is likely that Germany's arguments in support of more timely and less disruptive realignments will be more influential. Countries with fundamentally weak economies will be less able in future to treat the EMS as a de facto monetary union. On the other hand, nations in the 'inner core' of the EMS, whose aspirations and economic performance match and in some cases better those of Germany, need expect no discouragement from Bonn or Frankfurt if they seek to create a monetary union of limited size later in this decade.</p>

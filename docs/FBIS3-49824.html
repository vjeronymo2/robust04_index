			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, January 16 (TANJUG) -- Serbian  Vice-Premier Danilo Markovic said on Saturday during talks with  a Spanish parliament delegation that local self-administration  and cultural autonomy for the Albanian national minority can be  introduced in Serbia's southern province of Kosovo-Metohija  (Kosmet), but certainly not state autonomy because that would  endanger the territorial integrity of the republic.    The Spanish political-parliamentary delegation, headed by  Ernest Luch, was informed in detail by Markovic about the  genesis and strategy of Albanian separatism in Kosmet and  efforts by Serbia to normalize the situation in this province.  A strong separatist movement has been active for decades in  Kosmet, where ethnic Albanians are the majority population.  Ethnic Albanian political leaders urge the secession of this  province from Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and  its annexing to neighbouring Albania.    The Spanish MP's, who have been touring former Yugoslavia  for  several days in order to collect information about developments  and possibilities for a peaceful and just resolving of the  crisis in this region, had talks in Belgrade on Saturday with a  delegation of the republic of Serb Krajina, which was headed by  Vice-Premier Stojan Spanovic. The Spanish delegation was  informed about the history of the republic of Serb Krajina on  the basis of data from works published by foreign historians and  cartographers and figures of the Roman Catholic Church, which  testify to the centuries-long compactness of the ethnic presence  of the Serb people in the current territory of Krajina. The  Spanish representatives said that these figures were generally  ignored abroad.    The Krajina delegation pointed out that the international  community should accept the right of the Serb people to  self-determination in agreement with the United Nations Charter,  because Serbs in Krajina will never again agree to be governed  by Croatia.    The republic of Serb Krajina was formed in 1991 in  Serb-populated parts of Croatia in answer to Croatia's forcible  secession from former Yugoslavia and attempts to reduce the Serb  people to a national minority. The republic of Serb Krajina has  been a U.N. Protected Area since March of 1992.</p>

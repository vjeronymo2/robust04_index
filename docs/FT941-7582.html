			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / MPs again back Sunday opening The bill which will permit large stores to open for six hours on Sundays cleared its final hurdle in the Commons last night when it was given a third reading by a majority of 93 (311-218). Mr Peter Lloyd, Home Office minister, said it would sort out the muddle of Sunday trading after years of failed attempts to reform the 1950 Sunday Shops Act. He described it as a 'clear and enforceable' measure which would commend itself to the majority of people in England and Wales. The Sunday Trading Bill, which now goes to the Lords, survived virtually unscathed when, during the report stage, opponents made a series of attempts to wreck its key provision. The absence of the party whips - MPs were allowed a free vote - led to confusion with many Labour backbenchers uncertain how to vote on an amendment seeking to limit the partial de-regulation to small shops with a floorspace of less than 3,000 sq ft. It was defeated by 300 votes to 239, with Miss Betty Boothroyd, the speaker, rejecting demands for a recount. An attempt to restrict Sunday opening to morning periods of not more than 4 1/2 hours was defeated by 308 votes to 258. Opponents of the bill gained one success when an amendment preventing shops opening on Easter Sunday and when Christmas falls on a Sunday was carried by 57 votes (304-247).</p>

			<p><P> July 19, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MOUNTAIN CYCLISTS DEFEND SAFETY RECORD  </P> <P> In Jeff Meyers' otherwise fine article on Sycamore Canyon on July 7, he claims  that hikers are gravely threatened by mountain bicyclists who have no regard  for safety. This characterization and the quote from Ranger Brit Horn asserting  that there have been accidents and lawsuits involving bicyclists are the only  mention of bicyclists in the article. This is a one-sided view of mountain bike  use.  </P> <P> It is worth noting that bicyclists are legitimate users of fire roads in  Sycamore Canyon; that the vast majority of bicyclists ride carefully with high  regard for the safety of other users; that CORBA's (Concerned Off-Road  Bicyclists Assn.) volunteer Mountain Bike Patrol works closely with the state  parks to monitor and regulate bicycle use in Sycamore Canyon; and that, to our  knowledge, there are no lawsuits involving "bikes running into and over people  in the hills."  </P> <P> Mountain bicycling, like hiking, allows one to experience the wonder and the  beauty of the backcountry. Bicycles are human scale, have negligible  environmental impact, and can be ridden safely and responsibly in multi-user  settings like Sycamore. My group, the Concerned Off-Road Bicyclists Assn., has  been working hard to educate all backcountry users in the appropriate use of  bicycles, and these efforts have often received positive coverage in The Times.  Meyers' focus on the negative case is frustrating.  </P> <P> Mountain bicycle use in the state parks has raised some difficult recreational  conflict issues, and unfounded claims and sweeping generalizations are  particularly troublesome in this point in time as the state parks formulate new  policy. To characterize all bicyclists by the few who ride irresponsibly is  like characterizing all hikers by the few who smoke cigarettes on Sycamore's  tinder-dry trails. In both cases, reckless and dangerous behavior threatens all  users; in both cases, education and enforcement are the solution to this  problem; and in both cases, this behavior should not reflect on the large  numbers of responsible users.  </P> <P> JIM HASENAUER  </P> <P> Van Nuys  </P></p>

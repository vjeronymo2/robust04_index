			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 26 Apr (MENA)--Palestinian-Israeli  negotiations chaired by Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political adviser to  Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, and Amnon Shahaq, Israeli  deputy chief of staff, resumed today.    The Security Affairs Committee and the Legal Affairs  Committee met to discuss the remaining disputed issues with a  view to reaching an agreement at the end of this week.    Khalid al-Qidrah, head of the Palestinian delegation to the  Legal Affairs Committee, noted some progress in the committee's  work. There is now a great deal of understanding on the main  issues, such as jurisdiction over territory and over criminal  and judicial affairs, he said. Once we finish with the  agreement, we will present it to the Palestinian leadership, he  added.    Palestinian sources have said that the Israeli proposals on  legal jurisdiction meet some Palestinian demands, especially  concerning the rights of foreigners in Gaza and Jericho and  legal pursuits in security and criminal cases.    The sources say that some differences, especially those over  the control of crossing points and the release of detainees,  have yet to be resolved and efforts are being made to reach  agreement on them.</p>

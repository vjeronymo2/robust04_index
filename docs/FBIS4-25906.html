			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 15 (XINHUA) -- Vice-premier and  Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam of the Democratic People's  Republic of Korea (DPRK) met visiting former United States  President Jimmy Carter today and discussed the nuclear issue  which is of common concern.    Carter passed through the truce village of Panmunjon and  arrived here this morning at the invitation of Kim Yong-nam on a  four-day private visit to the DPRK.    Carter's visit to the DPRK is aimed at facilitating  exchanges  of points of view on the nuclear issue among the United States,  South Korea and the DPRK. He is expected to meet with the  DPRK's leader Kim Il-song.    Carter had met with South Korean President Kim Yong-sam and  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu before arriving here.    It is reported that Carter's visit to the DPRK will help  solve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, but the U.S.  Government has said that Carter's private visit would not affect  its Korean policy.</p>

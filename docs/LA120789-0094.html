			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: SANTA MONICA;  </P> <P> WATER-SAVER INCENTIVE PLAN  </P> <P> The City Council approved an ordinance that will allow the city levy a fee on  residents who do not install certain plumbing fixtures designed to save water.  </P> <P> The city staff is expected to recommend next spring that the council adopt a  65-cents-a-month fee for each apartment unit and a $1-a-month fee for  single-family houses that do not have certain fixtures, which are expected to  include low-flow shower heads and toilets.  </P> <P> "It is anticipated that the effective date for the incentive fee will be  delayed until May 1, 1990," a staff report stated.  </P> <P> One critic called the plan a tax, but council members said that in passing the  ordinance they made a commitment to follow through on the city's water  conservation program.  </P> <P> The measure could raise an additional $327,000 for the city, which could cover  half of the costs of the program because it provides rebates to residents who  install water-saving plumbing fixtures.  </P></p>

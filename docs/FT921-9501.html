			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Trade and the Environment: US greens lose faith in promises US environmentalists see Gatt as dominated by business, and Gatt pronouncements as the inevitable output of an organisation which has no mechanism to balance the competing interests of business and environment. Mr John Audley of the Sierra Club sees little possibility of developing an international consensus on effective rules to limit environmental damage. 'Environmental rules rarely have broad support. Rules have costs,' he said. The scientific evidence demonstrating the need for them is often controversial. The tendency is for those who have to pay the costs to put downward pressure on the standards. International environmental compacts are rarely effective because they lack enforcement mechanisms, he said. Gatt is saying, 'environmental leaders can no longer lead because they have to wait for the rest of the world to follow'. Ms Lori Wallach of Public Citizen scoffs at the assumption that a country which industrialises will put new revenues into an environmental clean-up. 'Unless there is some mechanism to direct revenue into environmental activity, the evidence is it absolutely won't happen,' Ms Wallach said, citing as an example the Maquedora region - the environmental scandal of the US-Mexico border. Mexico and the US have just begun funding environmental programmes there because the governments want passage of a North American Free Trade Agreement. Mr Rick Hind of Greenpeace views the Gatt trade and environment report as consistent with the 'generally undemocratic approach' of an organisation 'subservient to multilateral corporations' and says that it is dangerous to estimate environmental costs in purely economic terms. 'The native Americans, who are not signatories to the Gatt, have it right when they say we must consider the effect of everything we do seven generations hence,' Mr Hind said.</p>

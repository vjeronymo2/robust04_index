			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Bank chief warns against further cuts in rates A WARNING against further cuts in interest rates came yesterday from Mr Eddie George, deputy governor of the Bank of England who becomes governor in July. He also fired a shot in a war of words with the City by criticising 'supposed pundits' from financial markets who complained that UK monetary policies lacked credibility. In his first policy address since his promotion last month, Mr George set out a wide-ranging view of how he intends to guide monetary policy with a 'total commitment' to price stability. He poured scorn on suggestions that the Bank was at odds with ministers over the correct way to lift the UK from recession and said that inflation was under control. Mr George also said a premature move to a single European currency and central bank would involve 'serious economic risks' ahead of greater convergence of economic conditions across the continent. He said, in response to questions, it would be 'at least nine to 15 months' before sterling rejoined the European exchange rate mechanism. However, Mr George's robust speech in Frankfurt failed to lift the pound, which after recent heavy selling remained weak last night. It also prompted rejoinders from some City commentators who said his comments did little to quell scepticism about how much the Treasury and Downing Street listened to the Bank before setting interest rates. Last night the pound closed in London against the D-Mark down 1 pfennig at DM2.3525, close to its all-time low. Sterling also lost ground against the dollar, closing down nearly 1 cent at Dollars 1.4185. In New York, it closed at DM2.3520 and Dollars 1.4175. Mr George's speech was designed to counter speculation about rifts in policymaking, principally involving Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor. Many in the markets believe Mr Major wants to cut rates quickly to spur demand, with Mr Lamont and the Bank urging caution because this could trigger inflation. Mr George said the value of the pound would not be neglected. Since sterling's departure from the ERM last September it has lost 15 per cent of its value. The 4-percentage point cut in interest rates since September to 6 per cent was 'fully justified' by the need to boost demand but keep inflation low, he said. Mr Hans Tietmeyer, vice-president of the Bundesbank, said people should not expect too much in the way of money-market interest rate cuts at present. He said last week's Bundesbank cuts in the Lombard and discount rates did not sound the all-clear for stability in Germany.

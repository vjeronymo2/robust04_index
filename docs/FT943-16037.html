			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Thorn poised to offload defence side Thorn EMI, the music and electronics rental company, is discussing the sale of its remaining defence businesses with potential buyers. Racal Electronics is thought to be the most likely buyer, but GEC has also recently re-entered discussions. GEC withdrew from talks last year after due diligence enquires had been conducted because a mutually acceptable price could not be negotiated. The businesses primarily manufacture radar, electronic warfare and electronic command systems. Turnover last year was about Pounds 115m. Most of the operations are based at Crawley, West Sussex. GEC is thought to be interested because there is a good fit between Thorn's business and its own electronic warfare operations. The Ministry of Defence may be concerned about the threat to national security if the business were sold overseas, though Thorn said it had no reason to believe that the MoD had placed unusual constraints on the sale. The current talks follow Thorn's agreement in principle to sell its defence electro-optical and missile-fusing interests to Thomson of France at the end of last month. Those businesses have turnover of about Pounds 80m.</p>

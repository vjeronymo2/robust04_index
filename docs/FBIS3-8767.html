			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Janos Wolfart, chairman of the National and </F> Ethnic Minorities Office, by Istvan Javorniczky; place and date  not given: "Minority Rights Do Not Depend on the Number of  Ethnic Minorities"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Javorniczky] Is there any  conflict today in the presence of national minorities here?    [Wolfart] No national minority group represents a danger to  the state's territorial integrity and sovereignty. No serious  politician in Hungary would claim this. On the contrary: our  national minorities are suitable for playing a role of mediator  in our relations with other countries. Our treatment of  national minorities is also an internal training for our  international relations, even if these national minorities are  small in number. Including the Gypsies, their number is  estimated at 1 million. However, only a quarter of this figure  is confirmed by the census. There are traditionally-acknowledged  national minorities, like Germans, Slovaks, Croatians,  Romanians, Serbs, and Slovenes. Gypsies make up the largest  minority group, and they are both the most heterogeneous and  most divided group. There are also groups that have almost been  forgotten, sometimes even by themselves, like Poles, Greeks,  Ukrainians, Ruthenians, Armenians, Bulgarians. The law on  national minorities lists 13 groups with special rights. They  are Hungarian citizens and have been living in Hungary for more  than 100 years as a group; they differ from the majority nation  through their own culture and language. [passage omitted]    [Javorniczky] We know who the law regards as minorities.  However, who regard themselves as minorities? To what extent do  the people in question want to fall under a "dual evaluation?"    [Wolfart] This is changing. An increasing number of people  are asking questions about what they are, where they come from,  and where they are heading. This does not mean that a lot more  people regard themselves as minorities on paper too. Besides, I  think that it takes a longer time for someone to feel that he  belongs somewhere and to also acknowledge this, and regulations  and a proper atmosphere can reduce this time, but this should  nevertheless be left to the individual to decide. Those who  acknowledge that they belong to a certain ethnic group today are  doing this more deliberately today than 30-50 years ago or in  the last century. Belonging to an ethnic group and coexistence  with the Hungarian nation does not lead to tension in Hungary;  one does not have to deny one's own culture or one's Hungarian  friend. It also derives from the fact that there is a very  close coexistence and there are not homogeneous communities  isolated geographically. The number of mixed marriages has also  increased in recent years. [passage omitted] The national  minorities living in Hungary do not feel threatened; nor do they  represent any threat to the Hungarians. The current situation  can be called basically friendly, and we hope this will  continue. It is another matter that the national minorities  will strive to represent their interests more firmly than  hitherto and to increase the importance of their institutions.  We should not be surprised and doubtful if they also formulate  demands and problems, in addition to positive things. We should  forget the idea that the national minority issue can be solved.  Today we legislate a good law and make a few good decisions  tomorrow, and everything is solved. Regulations are meant to  enable the national minorities to make use of their rights and  express what they find improper and press for the things they  want. Obviously, the state and the political echelons will have  tasks to fulfill. We must treat the national minorities as  partners, because we cannot prosper otherwise. [passage omitted]    [Javorniczky] What are the major national minority rights?    [Wolfart] The basic national minority rights are also  included in the Constitution. The state-founding role, the  right to create self-governing bodies, the right to be  represented, and the banning of discrimination are such basic  rights. The law on national minorities stipulates that the  national minorities have important rights as communities. The  right to create their own organizations, the right to learn and  use their mother tongue, and the right to have systematic  contacts with their mother country are such rights. It is also  the obligation of the state to guarantee and partially finance  all this. [passage omitted]</p>

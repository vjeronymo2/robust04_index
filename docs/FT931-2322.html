			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / International Company News: Provisions and poorly-performing investments behind Asko setback ASKO Deutsche Kaufhaus, the German retailer which is majority owned by Swiss-based Metro group, blamed high provisions and poorly-performing investments for a net group loss of DM468m (Dollars 283m) in the nine months to the end of last September. This compares with a profit of DM6m in 1991. However, Mr Klaus Wiegandt, chief executive, said yesterday that Asko was on course to make 'substantial profits' during this year on sales in the region of DM20bn. He said the group could make operating profits of DM200m, after interest payments. The company is paying no dividend for the nine months, its abbreviated fiscal year. Mr Wiegandt was hopeful the group would be able to pay a dividend for 1992-1993, but said the payout would hinge on the scale and timing of asset sales, which are intended to raise DM800m over the remainder of the year. The losses for the nine months, which totalled DM648m at the parent company, are to be offset by the group's reserves, reducing the group's asset-to-equity ratio from 11 per cent to 3.5 per cent. The group's debts, which stand at DM4.7bn, would be cut to less than DM2bn over the course of the year, Asko said. Turnover was just under DM16bn, up 12.8 per cent on the first nine months of 1991. Operating profits fell from DM328m to DM122m. The group's poor financial condition reflects a series of acquisitions made in the late 1980s, culminating in the purchase of the Co-op group in 1989. The high level of provisions reflects the fact that many of the group's investments are now worth less than when they were bought. As indicated in January, the group is to raise money through a mixture of outright sales and partial flotations. Asko confirmed yesterday that Morgan Grenfell, the merchant banking subsidiary of Deutsche Bank, has been retained to advise on the flotation of a 25 per cent stake in the Praktiker DIY chain. Mr Wiegandt said Praktiker's market value would be more than DM2bn.</p>

			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Khmer Rouge raise threat to UN peace plan KHMER Rouge guerrillas have told the United Nations they will refuse to co-operate fully with a UN plan to bring democracy to Cambodia, throwing the peace process into doubt three days before the country's various armies are due to start regrouping their forces and handing over their weapons. 'This constitutes a clear breach of the (October 1991) Paris agreement, and is therefore extremely unacceptable,' Mr Yasushi Akashi, head of the UN Transitional Authority, (Untac) said yesterday. The Khmer Rouge murdered 1m Cambodians during its rule over the country between 1975 and the Vietnamese invasion of 1978. Khmer Rouge leaders claim that they cannot co-operate fully with the UN until they are sure that there are no Vietnamese troops left in Cambodia. UN officials and various governments have appealed to China and Thailand, the main backers of the Khmer Rouge, to persuade them to co-operate with the UN plan, which is supposed to lead to elections in less than a year. Mr Akashi said the cantonment of forces would proceed as scheduled from June 13, although it would begin only in selected areas to avoid endangering the security of the other three factions. At least one of the factions said it could not regroup its forces unless the Khmer Rouge did likewise. Mr Gareth Evans, the Australian foreign minister, described The Khmer Rouge letter yesterday as 'brinksmanship' and 'more in the nature of huff and puff than a very real threat to the process'. Reuter adds from Moscow: Russia yesterday condemned the Khmer Rouge for obstructing UN peace efforts. 'The Khmer Rouge continue to pursue the policy of violating the ceasefire, enlarging the territory under their control, turning down constructive co-operation with the UN. . . ,' a Foreign Ministry spokesman said.</p>

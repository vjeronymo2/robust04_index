			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CULTURAL CLASH IN SAUDI ARABIA  </P> <P> In The Times' article "Women Drivers Banned by Saudis as 'Portent of Evil' "  (Nov. 15), the Saudis showed their true feelings towards Americans, who have  saved their country from being invaded and annexed by Iraq, when they condemned  Saudi women drivers as either "American agents" "communists or secularists." If  it weren't for the presence of American troops there, the Saudis would have  Iraqi drivers in tanks in their streets instead of Saudi women to complain  about.  </P> <P> We must not get involved in a war in the Mideast protecting people of such a  diverse culture who really resent us. As Sen. Bob Dole said, we are in the  Mideast because of three letters: Oil. We are there because of the industrial  complex to protect their supply of oil. We have ethanol and can convert our car  engines to run on that fuel and thus help American corn farmers and not have to  spend billions on Middle Eastern oil. That entire region (especially Iraq and  Iran) is holding us hostage because of our dependence on their oil.  </P> <P> We must break free of that dependence and let the area solve its own problems.  </P> <P> LOUISE KEARNES  </P> <P> Pacific Palisades  </P></p>

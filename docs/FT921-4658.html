			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Concern grows over lack of MGN sale DIRECTORS OF Mirror Group Newspapers are increasingly concerned about the lack of progress in finding a new owner for the popular newspaper group. Disquiet has been expressed to Mr John Talbot, the administrator responsible for the late Mr Robert Maxwell's controlling 51 per cent stake in MGN. The stake is effectively held by major banks because it was pledged as collateral to cover Maxwell debt. In January Mr Talbot ruled out an early disposal saying that consideration would be given to the timing of any sale 'when comprehensive information is available from the board'. Sir Peter Parker, chairman of a management buy-out team believes that delay could cause instability and damage the group. It is a view shared by at least some of the senior directors of MGN. There is also concern about the large financing charges and fees going out of the newspaper company while it essentially exists on a drip-feed. It is believed that MGN had to pay about Pounds 11m in charges to roll over debt. Fees from National Westminster Bank alone are believed to be running at the rate of Pounds 150,000 a month. There were unconfirmed rumours last night that Mr Tony O'Reilly, the Irish publisher and businessman and a potential purchaser of MGN planned to meet union representatives prior to the England-Wales rugby match at Twickenham today. Mr O'Reilly is a former Irish rugby international.</p>

			<p><P> January 2, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: BARR AND MADONNA WILL RIDE OUT THE STORMS  </P> <P> ROSEANNE BARR is a shooting star, one who many Hollywood observers believe is  consistently shooting herself in the foot. I don't feel this is necessarily so,  but it is true that Barr, who leaped from obscurity to superstardom in one  year, is now too hot not to cool down. We are, in fact, experiencing a Roseanne  backlash right this very moment, due to the failure of her first motion  picture, "She-Devil" (critics and fans didn't think Roseanne was "funny"  enough, completely missing the point of her role).  </P> <P> This professional setback, coupled with the star's sometimes bizarre real-life  behavior and increasingly sensational and unsavory press coverage, has fed the  public's growing realization that Barr is not your typical, wacky, lovable  comedienne. She's a deadly serious, admittedly neurotic, intelligent, testy  woman. She has also become one of the most powerful women in show business,  causing all the usual gripes about what a bitch she is for wanting control over  her own creation and product, the ABC sitcom "Roseanne."  </P> <P> Sudden power and popularity have, naturally, wreaked havoc on Barr's private  life (this almost always happens). Her longtime marriage fell apart, the  daughter she gave up for adoption when she was a teen-ager was discovered by  the National Enquirer and this painful episode had to be played out for an  audience of millions. Most recently, Roseanne called off marriage plans, and  her fiance, writer and comic Tom Arnold, entered a drug rehabilitation center.  Nevertheless, all this sturm und drang aside, I believe Roseanne Barr is in for  the long haul, as an actress, and in time, probably behind the scenes,  producing and directing. Her private life (well, her public/private life) will  continue to be fodder for gossip columns and tabloids, and that may be her most  difficult adjustment. I do not see Roseanne as a flash in the pan. I do not see  her disappearing. She will not go unnoticed in the '90s.  </P> <P> MADONNA MAY be the biggest movie star in the world. Despite the fact she's  never starred in a major hit movie. And Madonna will remain "the biggest" even  if her upcoming endeavor with Warren Beatty, "Dick Tracy," turns into another  flop.  </P> <P> The publicity, excitement and controversy that Madonna generates can only be  compared to the great motion picture stars of previous generations. When her  bomb "Who's That Girl?" opened in New York two years ago, Times Square was  jammed with thousands of frenzied fans. She already has, due to her videos, a  film image -- what she needs is a good movie.  </P> <P> Yet Madonna is endlessly fascinating, and she has been since the moment she  burst on the scene with her crucifixes, lace ankle socks, bustieres and that  astonishing air of confidence, bordering on arrogance. And with what to back it  all up? Her talents did not seem extraordinary. But Madonna kept pressing what  was left of society's propriety buttons, both in her work and her real life, so  that now who she is and all that that represents is far more important and  interesting than what she actually does. (Though, as "Like a Prayer"  demonstrated, what she does is also very interesting indeed!)  </P> <P> As her own self, blonde or brunette, in Spandex or peasant skirt, looking like  a goddess or a pizzeria waitress, she is bigger and more controversial than any  project in which she becomes involved. (Remember how "Speed-The-Plow" became  "Madonna's play"?) This kind of super-fame is a double-edged sword. Intense  public interest assures her survival as a star and a commodity upon which  Hollywood will continue to risk millions.  </P> <P> Such white heat, however gets in the way of one's viewing her at all  dispassionately -- as a serious artist (which she is. Take a look at her  powerful "Oh, Father" video), or even as a human being.  </P> <P> So Madonna, like Cher before her, will have to work hard for respect, for  intelligent analysis of her work, and for the right movie roles that will  finally put her over. And I see her political activism and influence growing,  too. She will succeed brilliantly.  </P> <P> Oh, there will be fallow periods to be sure. And spectacular comebacks -- de  rigueur for a genuine article like Madonna. She was hot in the '80s.  </P> <P> Now watch Madonna explode in the '90s.  </P></p>

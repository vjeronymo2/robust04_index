			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries ease with shift of attention to auction US BOND prices fell sharply across the board yesterday as investors ignored more bad employment news and instead reacted badly to a disappointing afternoon auction of new government securities. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year Treasury issue was down  31/32 at 103 9/32 , yielding 7.705 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was also markedly weaker, down  7/32 at 99 5/8 , to carry a yield of 5.058 per cent. The morning's news of a 46,000 rise in jobless claims for the second week of January would normally have buoyed the market. The figure, however, was in line with analysts' forecasts, and not enough to affect a market that was trading cautiously ahead of the sale of Dollars 9.25bn in five-year notes. Prices took a sharp turn downward after the auction, which was completed at an average yield of 6.28 per cent. The yield was higher than expected by dealers, and combined with the lower than usual bid-to-cover ration and the poor non-competitive demand, was an indication of only moderate interest in the new issue from investors. JAPANESE government bonds climbed to new highs on yesterday's bullish money supply data, but the market ended the day almost unchanged as profit-taking wiped out the gains. The money supply grew by a preliminary 2 per cent in December, down from the previous record low of 2.1 per cent in October. The news raised hopes of an easing in the Bank of Japan's monetary policy. The yield on the benchmark No 129, which opened at 5.20 per cent, reached 5.145 per cent after the money supply announcement. However, prices fell back on profit-taking and weakened further in the London session with the No 129 yielding 5.22 per cent. Short-term interest rates, which fell sharply on Wednesday, inched up again in Tokyo yesterday as the Bank of Japan squeezed the supply of funds in the money market. The rate on three-month certificates of deposit moved up to 5.0 per cent from 4.95 per cent. THE DUTCH government's financing agency announced it will close sales of its 8.25 per cent 10-year issue today, but will leave its 8.25 per cent 15-year tap open next week. The 10-year issue has raised a total of Fl 8.3bn this week, while the 15-year issue has raised Fl 3.9bn during the same period. Traders said the money raised by the two tap issues accounted for 30 to 35 per cent of the government's 1992 funding requirement. Although Dutch government bond prices closed higher, investors only bought a little of the tap issues, preferring to buy directly in the market. Elsewhere in Europe, German government bond prices were almost unchanged on the previous day's close. The Liffe bund futures contract traded in a range of between 88.21 and 88.52 before ending the day at 88.41. Traders noted that the futures contract was well supported at the low end of its range and did not fall below 88.20 which is an important technical resistance level. UK government bonds ended the day firmer in light trading ahead of the G7 meetings this weekend and next week's gilt auction. Traders said sterling strength helped to lift gilt prices, with the benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 rising from 115 to 115 13/16 by late afternoon.</p>

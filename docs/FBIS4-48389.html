			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  THE STAR </H8>   Human Development Viewed -- Johannesburg THE STAR in English  considers South Africa's ranking in the UN Human Development  Index in its editorial on page 10 on 18 May. It notes that the  index, which is an indication of the quality of life within a  country, ranks South Africa "alongside such shining examples as  Libya and Lebanon." Noting some regions of particular concern,  the editorial concludes: "The new Government is obviously more  people-oriented than its predecessors and its Ministers have not  wasted any time in calling for, among other things, bold housing  initiatives and the need to ensure access to clean water for  all. These are some of the fundamentals that will lift this  country above the Third World quagmire. The balancing act is  going to be a challenge."  <H8>  SOWETAN </H8>   Praise for Police -- Johannesburg SOWETAN in English in  editorial on page 10 of its 18 May issue notes that "radical  rightwing elements have been dealt a series of blows which have  taken a lot of wind out of their sails." The potential for  violence by the right wing is diminishing. The editorial  credits the police: "The police have done a sterling job,  especially against radical rightwing groups. Their swift action  has thwarted other possible bomb attacks....We can do no more  than praise the police for acting so fast and decisively against  terrorism."</p>

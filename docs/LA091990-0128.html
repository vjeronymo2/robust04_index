			<p><P> September 19, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RAMS;  </P> <P> DELPINO, MCGEE POSE DOUBLE THREAT AT FULLBACK  </P> <P> With three tailbacks sharing the load, the Rams might not have their  traditional 1,000-yard rusher this season. They might, however, end up with the  two most efficient fullbacks around.  </P> <P> Robert Delpino caught two passes in Sunday's victory over the Tampa Bay  Buccaneers and now leads the team in scoring. Two catches, two touchdowns.  </P> <P> Buford McGee caught one pass against the Buccaneers. It was only a six-yarder  over the middle, but it was worth six points.  </P> <P> The final score Sunday? Ram fullbacks 18, Buccaneers 14.  </P> <P> Fullbacks don't pick up much rushing yardage in a John Robinson offense. These  two have rushed the ball only six times this season -- McGee four times for 26  yards and Delpino twice for 13 -- and have a combined average of 4.8 yards per  carry.  </P> <P> Fullbacks certainly aren't overlooked in an Ernie Zampese passing game, though.  They've caught seven passes -- McGee four for 26 yards and Delpino two totaling  62 -- for a combined 12.6-yard per catch average.  </P> <P> McGee is the starter, but Delpino certainly gets his share of the glory. There  is, however, one major difference between them. McGee spends most of his time  flinging his body at linebackers; Delpino seems to show up only when it's time  to dance in the end zone.  </P> <P> "What winds up happening is that Buford handles the routine of the fullback,  the blocking and basically gets the (crap) kicked out of him," Robinson said.  "Buford's got towels and ice packs all over him.  </P> <P> "Bobby can handle those same things but probably isn't as good as Buford right  now. Bobby we want to have the football and we tend to hold him until we want  him."  </P> <P> It's getting to the point where the mere sight of Delpino in the huddle should  send off alarms in the headsets of defensive coordinators. And that, Robinson  concedes, needs to be corrected.  </P> <P> "We're making a mistake if they're saying, 'Here comes Delpino, they're  throwing the ball.' We planned to use him half the time (against Tampa Bay). It  didn't work out. But he's got to play more."  </P> <P> Cleveland Gary might be the tailback of the future for the Rams, but he doesn't  figure to dominate the position until he can shake off the effects of the lower  back injury that has hampered him since the beginning of training camp.  </P> <P> He carried the ball eight times for 42 yards in the second half Sunday, but his  back is still bothering him.  </P> <P> "It feels good to get going," said Gary, who missed all four exhibition games  and the regular-season opener, "but it's still a little sore. I'm just not  100%. It's been frustrating. It's just something I have to work through.  </P> <P> "You get those twinges. I really don't know how to put it into words. It's just  there. It's getting better, slowly, but I'll just be glad when it's gone."  </P> <P> Seven would-be kickoff specialists worked out Tuesday at Rams Park, including  Vince Abbott (Cal State Fullerton and the USFL's L.A. Express), Dave Van  Steenkiste (Cal State Long Beach) and John Carney (Notre Dame). All seven have  been to NFL training camps but none made the final cut.  </P> <P> The Rams are looking for someone to kick off in the event Mike Lansford, who  has a partial tear of the muscle near the Achilles' tendon, can only be used  for field goals and extra points.  </P> <P> Lansford, who says it hurts more to walk than kick, thinks he'll be able to  handle all the kicking chores Sunday against the Philadelphia Eagles. The Rams  are making contingency plans, anyway.  </P> <P> Kill the theme to Road Warriors.  </P> <P> The Rams have played eight of their past 10 games -- counting the end of last  season and this exhibition season -- on the road. Sunday, they will meet the  Philadelphia Eagles on the unfamiliar turf of Anaheim Stadium.  </P> <P> If they can find their way there.  </P> <P> "Our routine will be the same this week," Robinson said, jokingly. "Friday,  we'll practice a little later than usual, then we'll go to the airport and say  'Oh, we're playing at home.' And then we'll come back."  </P> <P> The Rams have played well on the road recently -- they were 7-4 including the  playoffs last year -- but Robinson still prefers a home game.  </P> <P> "I just think you wear down on the road," he said. "I'm not quite sure what the  effect is (at home), but it's just better. We had the last four on the road  last year, one in Berlin, two on the East Coast and one in the Midwest.  </P></p>

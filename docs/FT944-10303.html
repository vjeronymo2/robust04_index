			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Private finance scheme to shift up a gear The pace of the government's private finance initiative will accelerate over the coming year, Sir Alastair Morton, chairman of the government's private finance panel, said yesterday. He identified a number of new areas where the initiative might be applied and warned City institutions interested in participating in schemes that they would be expected to share the risks. There was no benefit to government in replacing public funds with a straightforward lease which simply spread out payments. Sir Alastair said: 'The one thing the City is not going to get is finance leases dressed up with a government guarantee and carrying a padded project management fee. We won't wear that.' He said the initiative, which was launched two years ago, had been slow to start, but resistance in the Treasury and other government departments was being overcome and a large number of potential projects with a total value of Pounds 10bn had been identified. Sir Alastair said: 'After a lot of wheel-spinning there is a momentum which will produce a lot of done deals within the next six to nine months. I am now more concerned about whether we can handle the amount of work than the need to get things going.' He was speaking two days after Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, unveiled plans to force Whitehall departments to seek outside funding for all capital spending. The panel, which first met last December, was set up to co-ordinate the private finance initiative and to encourage proposals. Among new sectors identified by Mr Morton were: Information technology programmes to transfer paper-based administration systems in government departments to computers. Applications include the Land Registry and Post Office Counters. Projects worth more than Pounds 1bn are being studied. Projects in the state-owned water and sewerage industries in Scotland and Northern Ireland, with a potential value of Pounds 1.2bn. The further education sector and grant maintained schools should be allowed private finance on a par with the higher education sector. Local authorities would be allowed to involve private finance under proposals currently out for consultation. State-owned organisations such as London Underground, Railtrack and the Post Office could buy in many services. Sir Alistair asked: 'Does London Underground need to own the pumps which keep its tunnels dry, electricity power stations, its escalators and pits signalling?'</p>

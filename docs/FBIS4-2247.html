			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 8 (XINHUA) -- Four exemplary youth  groups from China's Civil Aviation Departments were named "youth  civilization models" here today.    They are the first set of "youth civilization models" set up  in the country, said an official from the Central Committee of  the Chinese Communist Youth League (CCYL).    These models are expected to cause other youth groups to  improve their services and produce more youth civilization  models across the country, said the official.    The campaign, launched by the CCYL Central Committee, is  aimed to promote professional ethics among Chinese youth and  help them improve their devotion to work and serving the people.    The official said each enterprise from all trades in the  country has been called on to set up its youth civilization  models in the next year or two.</p>

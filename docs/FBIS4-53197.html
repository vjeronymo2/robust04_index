			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Sihanouk Deserts Cambodia"] </F>   [Text] King Norodom Sihanouk declared in Phnom Penh last  Thursday that he felt hopeless about peace in his country and  asserted that national reconciliation is dead. He said he was  leaving for Beijing.    In his news conference, Sihanouk said the Khmer Rouge  rejection of his peace initiatives led him to feel hopeless and  to cancel the roundtable meeting on national reconciliation.    Late last month, King Sihanouk invited the Cambodian  Government and Khmer Rouge leaders to a roundtable meeting at  his palace to discuss national reconciliation. However, his  invitation was rejected outright by Khieu Samphan, who claimed  that there was no guarantee for his safety.    Sihanouk issued another invitation to the two Cambodian  factions to attend a meeting in Pyongyang. He also let out his  frustration by saying that he would ask for foreign troops to  solve the problem in his country.    Last week, the Australian Foreign Ministry confirmed that it  received a request for military assistance from Cambodian  Foreign Minister Norodom Sirivut. The minister had made this  request to the Australian, U.S., French, and ASEAN embassies in  Phnom Penh.    Australia and certain countries are now considering arms or  military training for Cambodia and consulting certain countries,  particularly Thailand, on this issue. King Sihanouk, however,  denies any knowledge of the matter.    A decision by any Western country or its allies to provide  assistance to Cambodia, be it in the form of arms or military  training, is tantamount to interference in the internal affairs  of that country.    It can be said that by completely distancing himself from  peace efforts in Cambodia, King Sihanouk has given the leaders  of the two Cambodian factions the opportunity to seek foreign  assistance to continue a war of genocide.</p>

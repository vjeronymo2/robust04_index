			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / 'Douglas, I feel bowled out': Dominic Lawson imagines John Major's feelings during the test match John Major, we are told, follows the fortunes of the England cricket XI with a passionate intensity. We have been told so by prime minister Major himself, and he probably believed that at the time he said it, too. Perhaps Major's latest debacle, his bungled attempt to change the basis of the European Community's voting structure, owed something to the distractions of watching the satellite television coverage of the English cricket team's test match against the West Indies. I can envisage foreign secretary Douglas Hurd making the short walk across from King William Street to Downing Street, attempting to tell Major that the Spanish were not going to continue to hold out with the British against the rest, to be met with: 'Douglas, can't you see that we are on the verge of a famous victory? The West Indies have not lost a match at Port of Spain for 17 years. If Atherton's men can beat Curtly Ambrose and co, surely you can beat those medium pace trundlers in Brussels.' 'But prime minister, Mr Atherton is playing 11 against 11. We are one against 11. It's just not cricket out there in the enlargement negotiations.' 'Just block the straight balls, Douglas, and whack the loose ones. Oh, and remember to stay on the front foot, in case the French bowl something mean and low.' 'Prime minister, I really think . . .' 'Oh shush, Douglas, Hick has just dropped another sitter, and I want to see the action replay after the break. By the way, why are there so many advertising breaks on Sky, Douglas?' 'Since you ask, prime minister, we agreed that Rupert Murdoch's channel should not have to observe any of the rules which keep terrestrial television tasteful. He said he wouldn't put up the money otherwise. I believe this was when I was home secretary. Or perhaps it wasn't. We've had so many home secretaries over the past few years, I really can't remember.' 'Stop reminiscing, Douglas, get back to that easy-paced wicket in Brussels, and play yourself into form, like Graham Thorpe in the first innings.' 'Graham Thorpe, prime minister?' 'Oh you must know who I mean, Douglas, the plucky little Surrey left hander.' 'I'm afraid, Prime Minister, that your cricketing metaphors are lost on me. I was a wet bob.' 'Wet bob? Is that one of your awful political dining clubs? What are you talking about, Douglas?' 'Schooldays, prime minister. We called cricketers dry bobs, and rowers wet bobs. At Eton. You see . . .' 'I thought I told you never to mention that word in my presence.' ' Sorry, prime minister,' said Hurd, who, in the awkward silence which followed, began humming 'blade on the feather', subversively, under his breath - the Eton boating song had always inspired the foreign secretary at such testing times. 'Well, Douglas, while you've been staring at the ceiling, singing the European anthem, we've got the West Indies all out. Now Athers and the lads have only got to get 194 runs to win. Sit down in Norma's chair and enjoy watching an English triumph.' The foreign secretary walked across the room, poured himself a glass of good French brandy, and sat down. In the meantime Major seemed suddenly to have slumped in his seat. Hurd looked at the television with a puzzled expression on his fine patrician features: 'Prime minister, why is Mr Atherton walking across the screen with a cartoon picture of a duck under his name?' 'Shut up Douglas, this is serious.' A few seconds later another England batsman trailed gloomily across the screen with the same undignified mallard for company. And another. And another. ''Exit, pursued by a duck' one might say, prime minister,' chortled the foreign secretary. Major groaned. 'All right, Douglas, have it your way. Go back to Brussels, and tell them we give in.' 'Quack, quack, prime minister.' Dominic Lawson is Editor of The Spectator.</p>

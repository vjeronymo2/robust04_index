			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Leading Article: Changing the constitution CONSTITUTIONAL reform is an ugly phrase. It conjures up instability and militant minorities; and its apologists are branded as naive and out of touch with the great majority satisfied with their governance. Yet such fears and stereotypes are increasingly misplaced. Demands for reform of the governmental system are growing and many are well-founded. It is time they were treated with more respect in Westminster and Whitehall. The publication of Mori's 'state of the nation' poll, the most extensive of its kind for a decade, reveals deep dissatisfaction. Large majorities believe that power is too centralised, that parliament is too weak, and that civil liberties are inadequately protected. Support for electoral reform, referendums, a bill of rights, an elected House of Lords and fixed-term parliaments is accordingly strong. Barely one-third of voters are broadly satisfied with the way they are governed, compared with 48 per cent in strike-bound 1973. It is not just a question of poll figures. Britain's economic and social predicament cannot be divorced from its political structure. Historically, that structure has served Britain well, and its strengths  - parliament foremost among them - should be nurtured. But Victorian notions of the unitary state, parliamentary sovereignty and the rule of law are no longer the last words on constitutional evolution. Most of our European partners have gone well beyond them: we should learn from their experience, particularly that of the Federal Republic of Germany, and not pretend that Britain is a world apart, incapable of constitutional improvement. External pressures Yet even if the main parties keep up the pretence, external pressures will intrude before long - three in particular. First, the 'Scottish question' is assuming ever larger proportions. Mori found 51 per cent of Scots supporting devolution or greater autonomy, with a further third favouring outright independence. The Scottish constitutional convention - which includes Labour and the Liberal Democrats - is already championing far-reaching autonomy, with a Scottish parliament to be elected by PR. Scottish devolution in some form is just a matter of time; when it comes, the ramifications for England will be unavoidable. Europe is the second dimension. The extent of constitutional change already wrought by the Community is barely appreciated in the UK, and the process looks set to accelerate with the treaties following the two inter-governmental conferences. And the side-effects are at least as important: the Community, endlessly invoking regionalism and subsidiarity, has done more than anything to give credibility to an 'independent Scotland within Europe'. Intractable issue Third, the dynamics of Labour politics. The pursuit of untrammelled power at Westminster has always lain behind Labour's conservatism on constitutional issues. It will not survive a further election defeat, with the prospect of another redistribution of seats in view. Encouraged by Mr Robin Cook and his allies, the Labour leadership is already thinking the unthinkable. It may be committed to it after the next election. There is, of course, no stock reform package. Cool analysis should precede firm commitment. Without doubt the most intractable issue is electoral reform, because of its impact on the composition of the Commons, and thus of governments. Nonetheless, three lesser reforms have obvious merit. Fixed-term parliaments, with provision for early dissolution should a government fall, would reduce the election fever which currently preoccupies at least one year in every four. Referendums on major constitutional issues, for which there are precedents, could avoid repeats of the poll tax catastrophe. And incorporation of the European convention of human rights into British law would provide the basic guarantees for civil rights available in most democratic constitutions. For the rest, calm deliberation is preferable to crisis reform - and it should start now.</p>

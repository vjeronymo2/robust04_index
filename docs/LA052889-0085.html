			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALICE KAHN: TABLE TALK AMONG THE TRENDOIDS  </P> <P> "I don't think I was meant to be a mother," Bree Wellington told her old friend  Mai Blender over lunch at the Quilted Adobe.  </P> <P> "Meant, schmeant," opined Mai, a licensed therapist and an amateur  sarcasticist. "You've got the kid. Even Nordstrom won't take her back."  </P> <P> "Of course, I love Rachel Whoopi as I've never loved another human being. I  can't imagine life without her," Bree said, fiddling with the heel of the  baguette. "It's just that I don't think I have the patience."  </P> <P> They were interrupted by the sight of the waiter standing there like a symphony  conductor demanding their complete attention before he began his performance.  </P> <P> "Our specials today are the George Bush Squid Pro Quo with a confit of figs,  papaya, mango and corn. We also have a Dan Quail, lightly roasted with a  polenta happy face. And finally, there is the Jim Wright Pork Barrel with a  salad of mixed greens and aged goat cheese. The soup today is chayote, and our  wine of the week is Cheek Creek white Zinfandel at $6.50 a glass."  </P> <P> "Do we get to keep the glass? Does it have our team's name on it?" asked Mai.  </P> <P> "I'll have the Bush and a glass of the Creek," Bree said, her look telling the  waiter to indulge her boorish friend.  </P> <P> "Gimme the Quail and a glass of Diet Coke with a twist," Mai told the waiter.  Then she turned to Bree and asked, "You paying?" After Bree nodded, Mai added,  "Throw in a bowl of the chayote soup."  </P> <P> "Mommy, Mommy," screamed the little boy at the next banquette, "that lady's  eating a coyote."  </P> <P> "Nicodemus," his mother said. "Get your bolo tie out of your spaetzle!"  </P> <P> Mai looked at the boy and then made the finger-down-the-throat gesture to Bree.  She leaned forward and whispered, "Hell is other people's children."  </P> <P> She moved on to another subject that she knew would get a rise out of Bree.  "Have you heard the latest about Neal Blender?" she asked, referring to her  husband circa 1974 and Bree's lover circa 1984.  </P> <P> "He's dating Cher," she said and began snickering.  </P> <P> "But that's impossible," Bree protested. "Neal's over 30."  </P> <P> "I know," Mai cackled, "but it's true. He told me she might even name a perfume  after him -- Neal. But she'll spell it K-n-e-e-l. Kneel by Cher -- share the  fantasy -- something like that."  </P> <P> "Forgive me, Mai. I know you were married to the man for five years, but why  would anybody give up that pretty little Rob Camilletti for a balding,  40-year-old wanna-be screenwriter?"  </P> <P> "I guess for the same reason that you almost broke up with Dirk to nestle with  Neal."  </P> <P> "Now, just a minute. That was before Dirk and I were married and, of course,  well after your separation from Neal.  </P> <P> "Relax," Mai said, picking up the crumbs of the baguette from the tablecloth  and licking them off her fingers. "Neal and I had an open marriage anyway.  That's why we ended up divorced."  </P> <P> Just then, the waiter put down the bowl of chayote and slid the squid toward  Bree. As they were digging in, a man in a military uniform with a bandoleer  belt across his chest suddenly raced through the terra-cotta restaurant  brandishing a machine gun. A fig fell from Bree's mouth to the floor.  </P> <P> The man fired a rat-a-tat at the ceiling, but nothing happened. Then he  shouted, "The Creme Brulee is excellent!"  </P> <P> The waiters then surrounded him and escorted him out like assistants at a James  Brown concert. Before he exited through the kitchen, he screamed back, "The  Creme Brulee -- and tell them Gaucho sent you."  </P> <P> There were just 10 seconds of silence before the sophisticated urban diners,  accustomed to a world of mania and mayhem, returned to quiet talk about ruined  relationships and done deals.  </P> <P> Mai slurped her chayote and said, "This restaurant-as-theater bit has gone too  far."  </P></p>

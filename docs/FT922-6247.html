			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / Leading Article: A cry of foul BRITAIN'S independent terrestrial television companies are due in the High Court today to challenge a Pounds 304m deal struck last week between football's new Premier League and ITV's rivals, BSkyB and the BBC. This fact alone hardly merits comment; if ITV can demonstrate a breach of contractual procedure in the football deal, it is within its rights to seek to re-open the negotiations. But the roar of hyperbole from the ITV crowd which has accompanied the legal manoeuvre suggests a wider purpose. ITV executives have made three main points: that football as a sport and a business will be harmed by live coverage passing to a minority satellite broadcaster; that the BBC is unwisely collaborating with its long term enemy; and that consumers will lose by having to pay a satellite company next year for what they have had 'free' on ITV this year. The partisan illogic of these arguments would make a football commentator blush. ITV may be a good judge of its own interest, but is unlikely to be so for the BBC or for football. Nor can anything on a TV network funded by advertising be considered free to consumers. The doublethink in the ITV position is further exposed by the fact that some of those involved now want ITV to collaborate in a partially pay-per-view approach, possibly with a custom-made satellite football channel, in order to raise the ITV bid. These are all matters appropriately settled by raw commercial bargaining. Britain's broadcasting act requires that a few big national events be screened only on mass access channels; no one can reasonably argue that such a public interest applies to every kick of the ball in the Premier League. The new football deal is a good thing. It shows that Britain's more deregulated broadcasting environment can generate enterprising if risky new alliances and potentially more choice - football on a general channel free at the point of watching represents choice denied to those who have paid but do not wish to watch. Broadcasting is now a more competitive game; when you lose, it's no good blaming the other team.</p>

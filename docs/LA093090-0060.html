			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE;  </P> <P> A REALLY BIG SHOW;  </P> <P> MARTHA CLARKE'S AVANT-GARDE THEATER ALWAYS PUSHES THE LIMITS, BUT IN HER NEW  PIECE, 'ENDANGERED SPECIES,' POST-MODERNISM MEETS BARNUM &amp; BAILEY  </P> <P> "It won't look that way at all!" Martha Clarke says, letting her laugh rip  through the house. "Five days ago I was in such despair we called it the wake.  The show wasn't working so I redid a third of it in 2 1/2 days. At least there  is an ending and a beginning. Now, I just have to do the middle."  </P> <P> Such is the spur-of-the-moment, sui generis world of Clarke, one of the  country's preeminent and more idiosyncratic avant-garde theater artists.  </P> <P> A dancer and choreographer turned theater director, Clarke is the creator of  four theatrical works -- "The Garden of Earthly Delights," "Vienna: Lusthaus,"  "The Hunger Artist" and "Miracolo d'Amore" -- that juxtapose artistic  disciplines and vocabularies with puckish impunity and evoke sociopolitical  themes from dreamlike images by turns violent and erotic, grotesque and  lyrical.  </P> <P> In the 16 years since Clarke first raised eyebrows by sending semi-nude dancers  and actors flying on trapezes over the heads of her audience in "Garden," her  1984 stage exploration of the Heironymous Bosch triptych, the director has  divided critics and audiences with her esoteric yet visceral theatrical  collages, whose "erotic energy is exquisite in its humane power," Jack Kroll,  theater critic of Newsweek, wrote.  </P> <P> When Clarke's "Miracolo d'Amore" premiered at Charleston's Spoleto Festival two  years ago, the Italianate stage exploration of sexual violence drove several  patrons from the theater because of its onstage male nudity.  </P> <P> Clarke's latest project, "Endangered Species," will open the Brooklyn Academy  of Music's annual Next Wave Festival -- the premier avant-garde arts forum in  the country. With a budget of $800,000, it is Clarke's most ambitious work to  date and has elicited more than the usual amount of attention for its  dramaturgy, which owes as much to Barnum &amp; Bailey-style hucksterism as it  does to a post-modernist aesthetic. The 90-minute production will feature a  cast of dancers, actors and animals -- and showcases a 9-year-old African  elephant named Flora Baldini. The result is a dance-theater work about  domination and extinction.  </P> <P> "I saw a film about elephant poaching a few years ago," Clarke says during the  show's pre-New York workshop in Massachusetts' Berkshire Mountains. "And I  wanted to see if I could try and use animals as characters -- not like Tom  &amp; Jerry, but to see if you could put animals on stage without exploiting  them, (to see) if I could use elements of the circus without making it into a  circus."  </P> <P> For "Endangered Species," Clarke has deconstructed that ancient popular art  form, marrying some of its elements -- elephants and horses, bareback riding  and high-wire acts -- to the director's usual cast of dancers, actors and  singers, who perform a text adapted from Walt Whitman's 19th-Century epic poem,  "Leaves of Grass," and accompanied by a sound track composed of old opera  recordings, jungle noises, gun shots and Hitler's speeches.  </P> <P> All of this is set in one of Clarke's typically minimalist but emotionally  charged environments. She has converted the stage of BAM's 900-seat Majestic  Theater into a circular expanse covered in gray ash. The stage is backed by a  35-foot wall painted like a glowering sky, in which is set a massive corniced  double-door that swings wide to reveal the elephant -- or occasionally a horse  -- bathed in pure, white light. The result is a visual and aural collage that  Clarke says "looks like a George Stubbs painting, you know, those English horse  portraits with all that sky," and that explores man's inhumanity to man and the  environment with specific references to the Holocaust and the American Civil  War.  </P> <P> "This is a much bigger subject matter than anything I've done in the past,"  Clarke says. She originally intended to focus more specifically on the  Holocaust, a subject she had begun to investigate in "Vienna: Lusthaus," her  1987 work that examined pre-World War I Vienna with its echoes of anti-Semitism  and militarism.  </P> <P> However, the substitution of the Whitman poetry for an earlier original text by  Charles Mee, the writer and historian who had collaborated on "Vienna," as well  as the use of Clarke's typically improvisational work processes, refocused  "Endangered Species" so that it is "less European, less intellectual, less  abstract" and "more about the continuation of life in general," Clarke says.  </P> <P> "I always pick subjects that are hard -- 'Garden' was about heaven and hell --  and I don't know why," Clarke says with a slightly rueful laugh. "I am  interested in history, but I have visual interest in history."  </P> <P> Indeed, nearly all theater works by Clarke began as dramatic responses to  paintings. "Garden" was inspired by Bosch, the 15th-Century Dutch painter,  "Vienna" by Egon Schiele, the Austrian draftsman, and "Miracolo" by  18th-Century Venetian painter Giovanni Tiepolo. "Endangered Species" is  something of a departure for Clarke. However, it is the most American of her  works, which have "been rather Germanic in their origins," as she puts it. And  the production is also a leap ahead for the director by being the least  allusive.  </P> <P> "Martha has always had this incredible painter's eye," says Harvey  Lichtenstein, BAM's executive producer. "Her use of imagery comes from her  dance background. But in 'Endangered Species,' she has become more  sophisticated and has created work that is more complex, more integrated and is  more about themes than a theatrical response to painted images."  </P> <P> "I have a visual response to everything," says Clarke, who studied visual art  before entering Juilliard as a dance student in the 1960s and who went on to  found the modern dance troupe Pilobolus. "I was married to a sculptor and I  have lived with a painter, so I have always been about eyes," she says, batting  her lashes.  </P> <P> A small woman in her mid-40s with loosely pinned dark hair, a dancer's posture  and a frequent laugh, Clarke is sitting in the living room of her rented summer  house on a rare day off from rehearsal. She has been at work on "Endangered  Species" for nearly two years, or for almost as long as she has known Flora,  the centerpiece of Circus Flora, a small, 5-year-old St. Louis-based circus  that Clarke first encountered in Charleston, S.C., during the 1988 Spoleto  Festival.  </P> <P> That chance encounter, in addition to seeing the film on elephant poaching,  provided her initial inspiration. That and "a dream I had of this dancer on the  back of a horse," she says. "That was the night I decided to do this."  </P> <P> "I remember Martha called me from Charleston and said, 'I want to do a piece  with circus animals,' " recalls Lyn Austin, producing director of New York's  Music-Theater Group, which is co-producing "Endangered Species" and is the  theater where Clarke has worked for most of the past 15 years. "I've known  Martha a long time and I know how she works, so I said, 'This is incredible,  let's do it.' "  </P> <P> Clarke says the impetus for this piece is a desire to explore themes of  oppression and extinction, but also to seek a more immediate response to  animals. "I used to live on a farm and I am fascinated by animal movement,"  says Clarke, who owns one of the horses used in the production. "Like when  crows settle on a cornfield, I would always wonder, 'How did they know how to  make such beautiful spatial arrangements? Why can't choreography be that easy?'  "  </P> <P> As she did with most of her earlier productions, Clarke began to work on  "Endangered Species" with small groups of dancers and actors in improvisational  exercises. One of these involved an African-American actress and a white  dancer, leading to the Civil War and racial oppression themes. "My work is a  lot like painting with people," Clarke says, "creating tension between moving  people and stationary people. It's sort of like controlling the frame of a  photograph or a frame of film. Except you don't get to do close-ups or move the  camera, you only have the eye of the audience to manipulate."  </P> <P> Very early on in the process, Clarke enlisted the aid of her longtime  collaborators -- set and costume designer Robert Israel, composer Richard  Peaslee and lighting designer Paul Gallo -- to create what Clarke calls a  "post-final Noah's Ark look, sort of shattered, a few horses, an elephant and a  few people dressed like refugees walking through ashes and set against that  huge painted sky."  </P> <P> Israel says, "Because Martha has such a physical response to things, she works  best when she has an environment to work in, an actively aggressive space for  her to tame and control. Otherwise she is kind of wandering. "  </P> <P> Clarke agrees. "When I do this stuff, I don't really know what I'm doing and  you never get the long view. It's like painting the Sistine Chapel. My  relationship to the whole thing is so myopic -- just magnified views of an  elbow."  </P> <P> Typically for the director, the addition of each new element to the collage --  in this case, the giant backdrop, Whitman's poetry, the operatic sound track --  involved extensive reworking of a creative process that Clarke describes as "a  house of cards. You move one thing, everything moves." For example, the  last-minute substitution of the Whitman work, adapted by writer Robert Coe,  bolstered the production's themes of "love, sex, earth, death, (it) wasn't  dialogue and the actors had to find characters and an edge in all that  romanticism," Clarke says. The opera recordings, including Alma Gluck singing  Rimsky-Korsakov, were thrown into the mix, she says, "because like old  photographs, I thought they would be evocative of endangered civilizations.  Like all that might be left of an elephant one day would be a video, you know:  'dust to dust.' Old opera always sounded very dusty to me."  </P> <P> "It is the juxtaposition and contrast that makes it interesting," says Peaslee,  who assembled the score with composer Stanley Walden. "It's the effect of  hearing opera in the jungle or Hitler in the jungle." It is also the first time  that Clarke and Peaslee have used a prerecorded digital sound track rather than  live musicians, and as the composer says, "We're hoping we can pan the sound  around the theater" for even greater spatial effects.  </P> <P> And then there were the animals. If not exactly two by two, they came with a  myriad of technical problems that went beyond the demands of training the  dancers to work the horses and the elephant. "It's just been unbelievable,"  Clarke says about the summerlong rehearsal process under a tent pitched on  Herman Melville's estate in Stockbridge. "The horse I bought for the show went  totally lame, I lost one dancer because of back problems, lost a drummer from  Senegal. The budget was supposed to be a third bigger, so I couldn't use this  17-foot giraffe named Vicky I had planned on. We had cracked ribs, sprained  ribs, mosquitoes, storms, mud and flooding and no private life at all. Many  times I just thought why am I doing this?"  </P> <P> In addition to wrestling with the technical difficulties, Clarke also had to  prune her use of the animals to keep the production from becoming too  circuslike. First to go was a goat, a macaw and a Capuchin monkey, because  "small animals look too cute on stage," Clarke says. Then came adjustments in  the elephant's performance. "Flora is a comedian and her rhythms are those of  the circus, not the theater," she says. "She was throwing clothes out of a  suitcase and pouring tea. She was very funny but we had to respect the  integrity of the Whitman. It was hard to let her be a clown and still give the  show some bite."  </P> <P> About her work process, Clarke adds, "It's like writing fiction or carving  marble. You keep saying this has to go, this has to go. I love economy and a  certain degree of minimalism as long as it's emotionally charged minimalism."  </P> <P> Clarke traces that minimalism to her years as a dancer with Pilobolus. She  began moving into the realm of theater and the use of spoken text in the late  1970s. "I used to get so bored performing, I would cry on stage," Clarke says.  Her first theater work -- the 35-minute, two-person "Metamorphosis in  Miniature," based on Kafka's writings -- played at Austin's Music-Theater Group  with the help of actor Linda Hunt. That piece won an Obie award and led Clarke  into further hybrid theater pieces.  </P> <P> Today, Clarke's work is considered distinctive for its improvisational  approach, and the use of "found" objects that is similar to the approaches of  the Open Theater and Living Theater during the 1960s. Her work also has echoes  of the classical modernism practiced by choreographers Antony Tudor and Jose  Limon in the '70s and bears more than a passing resemblance to the imagistic  theater pioneered by director Robert Wilson.  </P> <P> "She is non-imitable," says Michael Feingold, a theater critic with the Village  Voice. "She doesn't deal in the conventions of performance art, although she is  most at ease with the physical vocabulary of dance, she is really about image  theater. Her genre is what everyone disagrees about."  </P> <P> Throughout all the head scratching, however, Clarke has worked slowly but  steadily, most often under the aegis of the Music-Theater Group, surviving on a  series of grants and awards. She has won a Guggenheim, several National  Endowment for the Arts grants, and this year a $285,000 MacArthur grant,  largess that Clarke describes as having arrived in the nick of time, "because I  think I've finally made it onto Jesse's (Helms') hit list."  </P> <P> Clarke says she would like to give her work a rest. "I want to go home, make  dinner, read books, see my friends," she says. "And the MacArthur will make it  possible for me to do more traveling. I know Europe very well, but I want to  see South America, India, Russia, Africa."  </P> <P> Next up on the creative docket? Clarke will possibly direct a ballet in Italy,  an opera in Canada, or maybe make a film. "I think it's the seven-year itch,"  she says, smiling. "I want to go work where there is more structure and also I  think that film is logical development of my discipline. Maybe it won't be, but  I would like to try."  </P> <P> When asked about overall significance of her compact but ground-breaking  artistry, Clarke emits another shriek of laughter, accompanied by a chorus from  the songbirds here in her living room. "I'm not intellectual at all. I guess,  in a way, my work is really about the realm of dreams. It has been a way to  discipline my devils, get one's snakes out of their lair and make sense of  them," she says.  </P> <P> "I'm not saying my work is therapeutic, but you do reveal yourself to yourself.  I'm a kind of nice Jewish girl from Baltimore. I like a clean house, nice  furniture, good food. Then I look at this Angst on the stage, this intensity  and I say, where does that come from? It's like the three faces of Eve. Like  what is that voice? It's not the voice that brushes her teeth. It's the  subliminal voice."  </P></p>

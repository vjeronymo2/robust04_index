			<p>BFN     [Text] Faysal al-Husayni, head of the Palestinian  delegation to the peace negotiations, hailed the great efforts  and continuous support Jordan has extended and is extending to  the current restoration works of the Dome of the Rock.    He added: What has been achieved there so far is considered  a very great accomplishment which has rescued the Dome of the  Rock. We can only express our thanks and gratitude to Jordan for  what it has done in this field.    In a press statement after meeting with Prime Minister Dr.  'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali at the Prime Ministry today, al-Husayni  emphasized the importance of the Jordanian role and the support  the Jordanian Government extends for the efforts of the  religious establishments in Jerusalem in order to protect the  holy shrines there.    He said it was agreed that the Islamic Awqaf Establishment  will shoulder full responsibility for restoration actions in the  holy al-Aqsa Mosque and the al-Ibrahimi Mosque.    He said the enormity of the events and the circumstances  surrounding us require us to boost current coordination to reach  the level expected from us during the next stage.    He added that during his meeting with Dr. al-Majali, which  was also attended by Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, minister of state for  cabinet affairs and information minister, and the Palestinian  ambassador in Amman, he discussed several issues, including  Jerusalem. Great emphasis was placed on this subject and on  concentrating on bilateral coordination concerning this  important subject.    Answering a question by the Jordanian news agency on the  Cairo agreement, which the PLO and Israel recently signed,  al-Husayni said: Expediting Israeli withdrawal and starting to  implement the agreement will undoubtedly be a step forward, and  we hope that Israel will apply the agreement in a manner that  serves the spirit of the agreement.    On the international observers who will be deployed in  Hebron, and whether their number is enough to protect the  population of this city, al-Husayni said that what is enough to  protect the population in Hebron is an Israeli withdrawal and  the uprooting of the Israeli settlements in the area. He added  the international presence is something new that will  undoubtedly serve the Palestinian position, and that although it  is not enough to protect the Palestinians, it will be an  assisting factor.    The meeting discussed in detail the situation in Jerusalem  and the need to preserve its Arab character, as well as the  restoration works on of the Dome of the Rock and the holy  al-Aqsa Mosque.    At the meeting, it was agreed that the subject of Jerusalem  is one of the most important issues, therefore, the two sides  emphasized the need to activate the Jerusalem Committee that  Jordan and the PLO had agreed to set up within the framework of  comprehensive coordination between Jordan and the PLO.</p>

			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Weekend Money: Trusts face disclosure crunch - Disclosure of Investment Charges Not many insurance salesmen will be out and about tomorrow - January 1. But those who are will, for the first time, have to provide clear information about charges, risks and commission payments, writes Tim Miller. For those involved with unit trusts, there has been a stay of execution. The first proposals on unit trust disclosure came out in September and are being revised in the light of industry comment. The new version is expected soon and could come into force on July 1. Many unit trust managers are miffed that they should be brought into line with insurance products. They say unit trusts are transparent and the percentage rates of charges and commissions always have been stated clearly True. But the point is not simply to disclose facts but, rather, to communicate clearly to prospective buyers the effect of those facts. Not many people can do compound interest sums in their heads - which might explain why charges and commissions have increased so markedly despite their apparent transparency. Until controls were lifted in 1979, a unit trust could charge a total of 13.25 percentage points over 20 years. The rate of commission to agents was a fixed 1.25 per cent. A typical charging structure was 3.25 per cent initial (of which the manager retained 2 per cent) and 0.5 per cent annual. Today, a typical unit trust personal equity plan might have a 3 per cent initial charge, all of which goes to the agent, and an annual charge of 1.5 per cent, of which 0.5 per cent is passed back to the agent as renewal commission. In percentage points over 20 years, this adds up to 33, compared with 13.25 under the old regime. Of those 33 points, the manager's share now is 20 compared with 12, a moderate increase. But the agent's share is up from 1.25 points to 13 - more than 10 times as much. Given reasonable performance in the underlying fund, the agent will do even better because the 0.5 per cent renewal is calculated not on the basis of the original investment but on its re-based value year by year. Such generosity can be financed only by reducing the return to the investor  -who, so far, has not had this explained properly. After July 1, however, all should become clear. For unit trust managers, there may well be a serious choice to be made from July. On the one hand, there will be those with low-cost, no-commission products selling through a small number of up-market, fee-earning IFAs. On the other, those with high-cost renewal commission products will continue to sell through the more traditional IFA outlets. But they will have a lot of explaining to do.</p>

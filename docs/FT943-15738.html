			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Broker support lifts BT BT consolidated its position as the UK's biggest company, measured by market capitalisation, following a strong buy recommendation from Robert Fleming Securities. BT fully-paid shares settled 6 1/2 firmer at 383p and the partly-paid 5 1/2 up at 264 1/2 p. Combined turnover in the two classes of stock was 19.6m shares. Mr Laurence Heyworth, telecoms analyst at the stockbroker, set a short term target price of 420p for the fully-paid shares, telling clients that BT's first-quarter figures expected on July 25 should please the market. Fleming expects profits of around Pounds 750m, with inland call volume growth estimated at 6 to 7 per cent, against 2 per cent last year. 'A little good news could provide a powerful stimulus to the shares,' said Mr Heyworth. The analyst added that BT had become very attractive. 'In addition to the yield and price/earnings ratio, BT's firm value per line (ie market capitalisation plus debt divided by the number of fixed lines) is now only Dollars 1,430, the lowest of the quoted European telecom companies,' he said.</p>

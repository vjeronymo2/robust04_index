			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / World Bond Markets: Tokyo Bond traders are bracing themselves for a volatile week. Government bond prices are expected to fluctuate as a result of buying due to revived hopes of an imminent rate cut and profit-taking on expectations of increased supply. Prospects of prolonged political turmoil stemming from last Friday's defeat of the coalition government's political reform bill together with a further delay to the announcement of an economic stimulus package, originally expected this week, may support the No 157 10-year benchmark government bond, which faced heavy selling last week. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has until this Saturday to reach a compromise with the Liberal Democratic Party, the leading opposition. The government's inability to take economic initiatives is likely to renew expectations of a cut in the official discount rate. Investors will focus on the central bank's branch managers' meeting, which runs from today until the end of the week. The scheduled press conference by Mr Yasushi Mieno, BoJ governor, is likely to provide further evidence of economic weakness throughout the country. Meanwhile, the 10-year bond auction on Wednesday might trigger concern over increased supply, thus limiting a rally.</p>

			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Leading Article: Littlechild's task The privatisation of the electricity industry is in danger of becoming a victim of its own success. Less than five years after the sell-off, the power generators and distributors have been so effective at improving their financial performance that their profits have turned into something of an embarrassment. The review of electricity prices which Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity industry regulator, is now conducting provides the opportunity to strike a better balance in the way the benefits of privatisation are distributed. So far, these gains have accrued largely to shareholders (not to mention the industry's highly-paid senior executives). Unlike the gas industry, electricity has delivered price increases not cuts since privatisation. Prof Littlechild appears to share this view. His opening shot in the negotiations on the new price formula suggests that he intends to take a tough approach. He wants to tighten the price formula so that increases fall well below the rate of inflation, and he wants to put downward pressure on rates of return. Although the electricity companies will fight back, possibly even to the extent of referring the matter to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, Prof Littlechild should stick to his guns, for a number of reasons. One is that his own credibility as a regulator is at stake. He has been accused, with some justification, of taking a softer line on the industry than is required, preferring to go for elegant and sometimes opaque solutions to price regulation rather than the cruder shock therapy deployed by some other regulators. Another reason is that the electricity industry has seen this review coming for a long time - years, in fact - and has taken care to build up enough fat to endure a tougher price regime. Unlike the water industry, which faces huge investments to comply with EU water standards, the electricity distribution business does not have a heavy capital expenditure programme. Having said that, however, this review is not merely about squeezing overweight electricity companies. It raises important and difficult issues about the appropriate rates of return which a heavily capitalised industry should be allowed to earn on its assets. It will also address highly technical questions about how those assets should be valued so that investors obtain a fair return. Much of the debate during the coming weeks will therefore be rather arcane. But the aim of the review should be clear: to demonstrate in a well-argued fashion that regulation can provide an adequate substitute for market forces in a monopoly industry. If the decisions of regulators are to carry public support, it is essential that they be reached in a transparent fashion. At the end of the day, investors and consumers alike must feel that a fair bargain has been struck.</p>

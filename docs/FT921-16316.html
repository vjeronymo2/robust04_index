			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Rothschild life launch A NEW life assurance company opened for business this week. It may be starting off in a recession but it has the benefit of a famous name - J Rothschild Assurance - and Sir Mark Weinberg, the man behind the success of Abbey Life and Hambro Life, as its chairman. The target market for the new company - and its 180-strong salesforce - is the better-off investor. About two-thirds of its salesmen come from Allied Dunbar and are subject to a one-year moratorium on doing business with their old clients. However, they are relying on such clients to refer friends and acquaintances to the new company for business. JRA is offering a wide range of products, from critical illness through personal pensions and endowment policies to unit trusts. The one area which the company admits it lacks a policy at present is permanent health insurance. Nevertheless, it is quite a broad list for a start-up company. It has been able to achieve this, partly because it has subcontracted the administration of its policies to Scottish Amicable. Fund management is divided between three companies - J Rothschild Investment Management (whose chairman is Nils Taube), Scottish Amicable and M&amp;G. With products such as the personal retirement plan, investors will have the choice of these three management groups, running a total of nine funds. The unit trusts, which mainly come from the old Bishopsgate stable, include growth, international, greater European progressive, North American &amp; international and PEP progressive; two further trusts, UK High Income and Far East, are managed by M&amp;G. JRA will be a niche player. It is only aiming for a market share of 0.5 per cent this year and 2 per cent in five years' time, when the company hopes to float on the London stock market.</p>

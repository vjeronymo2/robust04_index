			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / People: Kiosk merchant learnt business the hard way; the customer is king The new managing director of the UK's third-largest off-licence chain learnt the art of retailing the hard way, through selling cigarettes, chocolates and chewing gum on the streets of Iran. Nader Haghighi, right, still just 35, has travelled far since then. He has just been tempted away from the country's biggest off-licence chain, Thresher (owned by the brewer Whitbread), where he was operations director with responsibility for 1,000 stores and 5,000 staff, to join Cellar 5 (part of the Greenalls group), where he will be managing 500 stores. He takes over from Peter Lloyd, who is retiring early on medical grounds. When his father died at the age of nine, Haghighi became the family breadwinner, combining his small tobacconist/confectionery kiosk with his schooling. He eventually graduated to running his own clothes boutique. It was invaluable experience, he says: 'I learnt retailing at the sharp end, learning how to behave with customers, discovering that you have to give them the right service and treat them as king. If I didn't, then they would just have walked past me on the street.' He came to the UK in 1979 hoping to study medicine. First he had to learn English. In the meantime, by 1980 he was also working as a part-time kitchen porter for Pizzaland; in 1981 he joined Thresher, also on a part-time basis. He moved fast through the ranks, proving himself in the mid-1980s by running a variety of Thresher outlets where staffing and stock losses were proving difficult. By 1990 he was the company's operations director, steering the group's three brand off-licences - Thresher Wine Shop, Wine Rack and Bottoms Up. It was, he admits, frequently an 18 hour working day, though he popped a bottle of Lanson on getting his latest job. 'I learned all the important skills in the bazaar, particularly the personal determination to make a success of any job that we might do,' says Haghighi. Not forgetting, of course, the importance of getting margins close to the 30-40 per cent he made back in his Iranian kiosk days.</p>

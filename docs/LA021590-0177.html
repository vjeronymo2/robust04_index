			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> NEW REGIONAL PARK SITE TO BE DEDICATED  </P> <P> City, county and state officials today will dedicate the site of a  long-proposed county regional park.  </P> <P> The ceremonies, to be at 11 a.m. on Seapoint Street near Palm Avenue, will mark  the first phase of the Bolsa Chica Linear Regional Park.  </P> <P> The new park overlooks the shoreline that has been blackened in recent days by  the oil spill from the American Trader.  </P> <P> "You can look from the park site and see the infamous oil spill," noted Barbara  Foster, executive assistant to county Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder. Wieder  will be among the governmental dignitaries taking part in the park dedication.  </P> <P> Ultimately, the new regional park will extend from Pacific Coast Highway to  Central Park and will include 113 acres. Much of that land, while pledged, has  yet to be officially donated. The dedication today will be of about 24 acres of  land the city already has given to start the long, ribbon-like park.  </P> <P> The new park is scheduled to have a hiking trail on which people can walk from  Central Park all the way to the ocean. Overlooks of the Bolsa Chica Wetlands  Preserve will allow park visitors to view birds that frequent the marshy area.  </P></p>

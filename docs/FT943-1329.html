			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Make the most from your home - How retired people can maximise their income As people live longer and retire earlier, they may find that, towards the end of their lives, they do not have enough money to live on. Savings become depleted and inflation eats gradually into a pension. Some may even have to consider going into residential care and will need to plan how to meet the costs (see below). Those who no longer have any savings may find that their last precious asset is their home. Depending on its value, it could be worth trading down. But many people under-estimate the costs of moving, while others find the idea too traumatic. How, then, to bridge the income gap? Home income plans. These have had a terrible name since the late 1980s when unscrupulous advisers encouraged many elderly owners to take a mortgage and invest in risky, equity-related investment bonds to pay off the mortgage and produce an income. Many investors were left with large debts or even lost their homes. Some are still claiming compensation (see right). There are, however, more secure plans on the market. The Safe Home Income Plan (SHIP) campaign, launched in 1991, has a code of practice for companies selling them. Members are Allchurches Life, Carlyle Life, Home &amp; Capital and Stalwart Life. The two main types of home income plan are: Mortgage annuity scheme. You raise a mortgage on part of the property, usually up to a maximum of Pounds 30,000 (so that the loan attracts maximum tax relief), and invest the money in an annuity which pays a monthly income after deducting interest payable on the loan. The annuity should be on a 'last survivor' basis so that it continues until the death of the second partner. Owners retain legal possession of the home, which is sold when they die to pay off the loan. According to Cecil Hinton of financial adviser Hinton &amp; Wild, a London-based firm which specialises in the home income plan market, it is best to fix both interest and income payments. The higher your age, the more income you can expect from the annuity - there is little point in thinking about such a scheme unless you are at least 70. Hinton says a single man aged 75 who is a basic-rate taxpayer could expect about Pounds 1,870 a year, and a single woman of the same age around Pounds 1,200, on a Pounds 30,000 loan. A married couple aged 75 would receive Pounds 770. Non-taxpayers getting state benefits must take into account the effect of the additional income on their tax status and benefits. Home reversion schemes. You sell your home to the company, giving up your right to the property, and are given either a lump sum or an annuity income. But since you could live a long time, the reversion company will not pay the full market value of the home - only a fraction. According to Age Concern*, which has a fact sheet on raising income from your home, the cash sum can be 35 per cent or less of the home's value and will rarely be more than 60 per cent, even for those over 80. You will not benefit from any rise in the property's value once you have sold it. A single man aged 75 (25 per cent taxpayer) could expect to receive a Pounds 24,500 lump sum or an annual annuity income of Pounds 3,400 while retaining a half share in a house valued at Pounds 100,000. A single woman of the same age would receive about Pounds 23,400 (lump sum) or Pounds 2,600 (annuity income). The corresponding figures for a married couple would be Pounds 22,300 or Pounds 1,900, according to Hinton. Paying for care. Most elderly people want to stay in their own homes for as long as possible. But with longer life expectancies, a growing proportion cannot avoid spending their final years in a nursing or residential home. The problem then is finding the money to pay for the care. Typical weekly nursing home costs of Pounds 300 to Pounds 400 exceed the incomes of most retired people and the state does not provide: anyone with assets of more than Pounds 8,000 (including their home) has to meet the full cost of their own care. In most cases, owners going into care have to sell their homes to cover the fees. But simply selling up, putting the money in the building society and paying nursing home fees out of the income and capital is not an efficient way to proceed - it does not take many years of fees at Pounds 20,000 per annum to consume the proceeds. Proper planning is needed. One recent development is special schemes designed to meet the immediate need for care and to cope with rising fees. Most use part of a cash lump sum (usually from the sale of a house) to buy an annuity, and invest the rest to try to replenish capital. Insurers offering schemes along these lines include PPP Lifetime, Commercial Union, Eagle Star, Clerical Medical and Scottish Amicable. But since these are complicated financial products, it is essential that you obtain independent financial advice before making any sort of commitment. A number of financial advisers around the country now specialise in providing advice on paying for care. Philip Spiers, a partner with the Nursing Home Fees Agency, looks at income, assets, entitlement to benefits and all other circumstances before working out the best way to cover fees. This could involve one of the plans mentioned above or a tailor-made solution. 'Every case is completely different,' he says. Other specialists include: London-based Advisory &amp; Brokerage Services, which offers fee-based advice on both the choice of home and funding methods; Morton-Wilson, of Nuneaton, Warwickshire; and the Kleinwort Benson private bank. Many elderly people are reluctant to sell their homes to pay for care because they want their children to inherit - but recent legislation makes this impossible. If an elderly person does not have other assets or income to pay for care, but does own a house, the local authority can put a charge on the property and recoup the cost of care when eventually it is sold. Transferring ownership of the property to the next generation does not prevent this. If a court decides that a person has disposed of assets to increase his entitlement to state help, he is treated as if he still owned the property.

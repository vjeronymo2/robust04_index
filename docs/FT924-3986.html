			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Arts: Miller directs The Double Dealer - Theatre in Dublin When Jonathan Miller directs Congreve in Dublin as part of Trinity College's 400th anniversary celebrations, great things are expected. The play was first performed at Drury Lane in 1693, and it was admired rather than liked. Then, as now, the problem lay with the characters of Maskwell and Lady Touchwood, as great a pair of amoral schemers as ever graced a tragedy. So what are they doing among the coxcombs and coquettes who form the rest of the cast of this comedy? The problem that a director faces here is whether to play up the comedy, thus pleasing the audience but rendering the tragedy as mere melodrama, or to focus on the evil (it is not too strong a word) of Maskwell and Lady Touchwood. Dr Miller, it seems, has taken the second option. Mellefont and Cynthia are about to be married, but not if Maskwell (who wants Cynthia) and Lady Touchwood (who lusts after her husband's heir and nephew Mellefont) have their way. Peripheral to the plot, but essential for entertainment are Lord Froth,'a solemn coxcomb', and Lady Froth 'a great coquette', Sir Paul Plyant, father of Cynthia and brother to Lady Touchwood, and his domineering second wife, Lady Plyant, plus Mellefont's friends, Careless and Brisk, the latter 'a pert coxcomb'. By now you will understand why there is a diagrammatic explanation of the characters' relationships in the programme. The set, by Mark Bailey, consists of a charcoal grey panelled wall set well down stage - the 'gallery' of Lord Touchwood's house rendered as a corridor, off which are four exits. The majority of the stage space is thus hidden from view, and serves as off stage apartments in which seductions and intrigues take place. The throne-like chairs at either edge of the set are seldom used. As the characters parade across the narrow strip of stage in their jewel coloured frock coats and hooped dresses, one is reminded of the famous 'serpentine composition' of Hogarth's Rake's Progress and Marriage a la Mode. It is a bold and refreshing approach, which eliminates the visual cliches of Restoration comedy, and exposes the sometimes creaking bones of Congreve's drama. It is also a disconcerting reminder that this play belongs to the same century as Webster's Duchess of Malfi. Initially the effect is exciting, but it soon wears off, as characters busily enter and exit without leaving any strong impression. The laughs, and there are many in the reading of the first three acts, are very slow to come, and once one is accustomed to the staging things start to drag. Oddest of all is the wildly varying quality of the acting. It matters not that Congreve is spoken in Irish accents, but silly lines must be allowed to sparkle, cocottes must flirt prettily, and gentlemen must move with confidence. Stanley Townsend makes a plausible, even masterful villain of Maskwell. Miche Doherty in a flea infested red wig is a delightful Brisk, and Rosaleen Linehan is magnificently absurd Lady Plyant in the only performance that provokes spontaneous applause. The rest are a lacklustre lot who do not seem to know what to make of the lines they are given. Jeananne Crowley acts her heart out in an embarrassing effort to make sense of Lady Touchwood, but we are none the wiser about her motives.</p>

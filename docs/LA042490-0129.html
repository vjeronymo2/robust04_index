			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOSCOW OFFERS NEW TERMS FOR LITHUANIA TALKS  </P> <P> The Kremlin, seeking an end to a damaging six-week-old political standoff with  Lithuania, has offered to accept the republic's declaration of independence as  long as Lithuania suspends for two years all measures leading to its  implementation, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's spokesman said Monday.  </P> <P> The Kremlin offer, presented to reporters in Moscow by Gorbachev's spokesman,  Arkady A. Maslennikov, also called for the Baltic republic to reaccept the  authority of the Soviet constitution, which its legislature has ruled invalid.  Then, Maslennikov said, Moscow likely would agree to open negotiations with  Lithuanian leaders.  </P> <P> But Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis unequivocally rejected the  Kremlin suggestions, saying: "This is a proposal which could lead us back to  the cage."  </P> <P> The Moscow proposal for a way out of the deadlock appeared aimed at defusing  the Lithuanian crisis before Gorbachev meets President Bush next month in  Washington.  </P> <P> The Baltic republic, forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1940,  declared its independence on March 11. Since then, it has been engaged in a war  of wills with Moscow that has prompted concern and some criticism of the  Kremlin from Western leaders, including Bush.  </P> <P> In an apparent attempt at compromise, Maslennikov said Moscow no longer  requires that Lithuania rescind legislation bolstering the independence  declaration. Earlier, this requirement had been voiced by Gorbachev himself,  and the Lithuanian legislature's refusal to comply led to Moscow's imposition  of economic sanctions, including a cutoff of oil and a drastic reduction of  natural gas supplies.  </P> <P> "We are not trying to bring anyone to his knees," Maslennikov said. "It is  secondary in which way they (Lithuanians) come back to the Soviet constitution  -- by rescinding the independence laws or by freezing the laws. If Lithuanians  want them to stand for history, then that is OK. That is their business."  </P> <P> In a further sign of conciliation, Maslennikov said that if Lithuania, even  while continuing to declare its independence, approaches Moscow "with a freeze  and is ready to stop producing unconstitutional laws, this may provide a basis  for negotiations."  </P> <P> Until now, Moscow has refused repeated requests by Lithuanian leaders to open  negotiations. Gorbachev has said that bargaining with Lithuania would be  tantamount to recognizing the republic as an independent country and that it  must first renounce its sovereignty declaration.  </P> <P> But Landsbergis, speaking to a news conference in the Lithuanian capital of  Vilnius, said that agreeing to negotiate with Moscow under the conditions  outlined by Maslennikov "would be like acting as though the prison sentence  which we have received, which we know is unjustified, were just. . . . Even  Franz Kafka (the late surrealist writer) couldn't have thought of such a thing.  </P> <P> "The proposal just to go back and obey the constitution of the U.S.S.R. as if  it were in force in Lithuania is completely illogical," he added.  </P> <P> In a defiant gesture, according to Soviet television, the republic's government  ordered the 15 deputies who are members of the national Supreme Soviet, or  legislature, to resign their posts in that assembly, saying Lithuanians could  no longer participate in the legislative bodies of other countries.  </P> <P> "I believe that today marks a kind of breakthrough. We are coming into a period  of active defense," Deputy Prime Minister Romualdas Ozolas said of the  decision.  </P> <P> Before the resignation of the deputies was announced, Maslennikov sounded a  stern warning about the possible consequences if Moscow's offer is ignored.  </P> <P> "The more rational redistribution of the oil and gas to satisfy other republics  was a strong signal to Lithuania that there cannot be a free-for-all with this  question," Maslennikov said, referring to Moscow's moves last week to cut off  oil supplies to the republic and reduce natural gas supplies by about 84%.  </P> <P> Further, the spokesman indicated that Moscow would try to prevent Lithuania  from replacing the energy resources with imports from the West, saying:  "Lithuania is still a part of the Soviet Union, and what can be imported or  delivered is a question for the Soviet Union."  </P> <P> The Soviet action forced Lithuania to begin closing down its only oil refinery  Monday due to a lack of supplies. Officials at the Mazeikiai plant, which  normally refines 37,000 tons of crude oil a day and has an annual production of  11.5 million tons, said they planned to use the next few days to overhaul  installations. But it was then likely the plant's 3,000 workers would be laid  off, they said.  </P> <P> Also on Monday, Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene said the United  States has refused her a visa to visit the country next month, saying she could  come only in June. Washington apparently did not want her in the country during  the Bush-Gorbachev summit, scheduled for May 30-June 3, she told reporters at  the airport in Moscow before traveling on to Vilnius after a weeklong trip to  Norway, Denmark and Sweden.  </P> <P> In Washington, officials at both the White House and the State Department said  they have no record of having received a request for a visa from her.  </P> <P> Prunskiene also said she opened a Swedish bank account Monday for Western  contributions to the republic. She said two donations already had been  received, including one for $100,000. She declined to identify the donor.  </P> <P> But she said the political support she felt from her trip was as important to  her as any financial aid.  </P> <P> "We came back feeling that we were not alone, contrary to the wishes of  somebody who would like to see us frightened," Prunskiene said at a news  conference.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Hamilton reported from Moscow, and Schrader, a free-lance  journalist, from Vilnius.  </P> <P> THE U.S. RESPONSE -- Moscow's stand is a "welcome sign" of flexibility.

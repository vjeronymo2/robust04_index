The 1988 results included after-tax earnings of $19.3  million from discontinued operations, which consist of its soft-drink bottling  business that was sold March 23, 1989. The firm attributed the gains to  improved performances by its theater division and Neiman Marcus Group, a  59.9%-owned subsidiary whose results are consolidated with a lag of one  quarter.  </P></p>

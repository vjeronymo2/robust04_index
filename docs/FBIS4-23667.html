			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Network Africa" program] </F>   [Text] In Liberia, the peace process appears to be almost  at a complete standstill. Disarmament of the warring factions  has come to a halt and the clashes have continued.    All this makes the elections planned for September look very  doubtful, and there is great dissatisfaction about the slow  progress among the international groups involved in the country.  In fact, the United States is threatening to stop all aid and  assistance to the country by the end of the month unless there  is a major step forward in disarmament. The ultimatum was  delivered to the Liberian National Transitional Government, the  LNTG. In Monrovia, Charley Brooks spoke to the speaker of the  LNTG, Morris Dukuly, and asked him for his reaction to the U.S.  threat:    [Begin recording] [Dukuly] One has to realize that  frustration has been seen in many quarters. I personally am not  surprised at the United States, or the United Nations, or ECOWAS  [Economic Community of West African States] and ECOMOG [ECOWAS  Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] who express frustration. Even  those of us who are involved in the process cannot help but be  frustrated.    [Brooks] What people are looking for now is that what is the  LNTG doing, I mean, really to speed up the process?    [Dukuly] You know, it is unfair for anyone to blame the  LNTG.  The LNTG is the picture of the parties to Cotonou. LNTG was  expected to succeed where IGNU [Interim Government of National  Unity] failed because LNTG was seen as a government of  inclusion, the reunified government, with all of the parties  represented and, therefore, cooperating. Are the parties  cooperating? I would plainly say not to the degree that we  would like to see them cooperate. What can the LNTG do about  that? I would say not very much. The LNTG does not have the  military force to whip a party into line if a party refuses to  cooperate.    [Brooks] Mr. Speaker, do you think with the slow pace of the  peace process, do you think the holding of the elections is  possible in September?    [Dukuly] You report for BBC Network; you see the realities.  Do the realities here point to the possibility of elections in  September? You need to create a secure, arms-free environment  in order to resettle displaced people before you even talk of  elections but I don't think that the realities on the ground  point to that.

It includes a series of demands regarding the  medical assistance and social protection of doctors, stated to  BASA Victor Benu, leader of this trade union. "There is no  medicine and medical equipment in the hospitals, 50 percent of  the sanitary equipment does not function, and only 40 percent of  means for health protection were allocated in the  October-December period," states the appeal. The trade union  demands an increase of wages by 15 percent.

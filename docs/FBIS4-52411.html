			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Tragedy Produced by War-Maniacs" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, May 9 (KCNA) -- Chang Tok-su, a  third-year student of the business economics course of Sejong  University in Seoul, was shot on the chest to death while in a  drill of the "reserve forces" in South Korea some days ago.    NODONG SINMUN today criticizes it as another tragedy  produced  by the "civilian" regime's war hysterics against the North.    The news analyst says:    The puppet Defence Ministry described "pressure of his heart  by a blank shot" as the cause of the death, but it was a  ridiculous sophism to conceal its criminal act in forcing the  university students to fire live cartridges in a war exercise.    Loud voices critical of the "civilian"-veiled war-maniacs  who  caused the death by driving students to a war exercise are  ringing out from South Korea.    It is a treacherous act for the Kim Yong-sam group to drive  out the students as a bullet shield in a war exercise against  fellow countrymen.    The traitorous clique of Kim Yong-sam is staging war  exercises almost every day, crying out for "tough posture" and  "military countermove" toward the North. This inflicts  immeasurable disasters on the people.    Unless the racket of North-South confrontation and war is  stopped in South Korea, the people cannot be freed from  disasters.</p>

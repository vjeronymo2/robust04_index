			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Stratagem turns in Pounds 280,000 Stratagem, which has evolved from an investment company into a group with interests in the manufacturing, distribution and service sectors, yesterday reported a pre-tax profit of Pounds 280,000 for the six months to end-February. The outcome compared with profits of Pounds 272,000 and came from turnover up from Pounds 690,000 to Pounds 33.8m. The results were bolstered by the inclusion of a first-time contribution from Harrison Industries, acquired last August. The directors said that all three divisions acquired with Harrison were reporting profits by the end of the period. At the same time Veritas, the car dealership operation, had benefited from the reorganisation which was implemented after it became wholly owned in late-November 1993. Earnings per share emerged at 1.6p (2.2p) and the interim dividend is maintained at 1.5p.</p>

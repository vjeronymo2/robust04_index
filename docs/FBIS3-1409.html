			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report]  <H5>  SUNDAY TIMES </H5>   Economic Justice -- "In South African political mythology,  economic justice is viewed as a matter of taking money from rich  whites and giving it to poor blacks. This perception, crude as  it is, underpins not only political rhetoric, but the policies  and perceptions of the ANC [African National Congress]," an  editorial in Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES in English on 27 March on  page 28 notes. A second myth postulates "a massive shift of  wealth in the past two decades from white to black," in effect  "the policy which the ANC plans to pursue is already, to some  decree, working." What has happened is a "massive shift of  wealth from the poorest class of whites to the richest classes  of balcks," in other words among "white and black, the rich are  getting richer (or, among whites, at least hanging on ti their  wealth)." "Unless the ANC adopts appropraite policies -- which  means, simply, policies that will lift people out of poverty by  placing them in stable employment -- we may subside towards the  conditions of Zaire." "Class divisions, not racial dicisions,  are likely to be the critical issues as rich blacks get richer  and poor whites poorer."  <H5>  SUNDAY NATION </H5>   Natal Marchers -- "We know at least about 60,000 brave Zulus  who believe that King Goodwill Zwelithini's idea of boycotting  the April 27 elections and establishing a sovereign kingdom is  not at all a bright idea," an editorial in the Johannesburg  SUNDAY NATION in English on 27 March on page 6 notes. "We want  to believe that the marchers are just the beginning of an even  larger Zulu community" which "will use its might to show the  world that it is not going to be a sacrificial lamb to save  Buthelezi's selfish political ambition." "This is the time for  all democrats to test their claimed popularity at the polls in a  fair manner. Ths process should take place on April 27.  Natal-kwaZulu should not be an exception to this rule."    De Klerk and the Generals -- "Open defiance of the state's  political authority by police generals implicated in third force  violence is worrying in the extreme," the second editorial in  the SUNDAY NATION on 27 March notes. "While on one level it  demonstrates the decree to which the police have become  politicised, at another it reflects the extent to which they  refuse to be held accountable for their actions." Weakness in  the presidency and Law and Order Ministry derive from "the fact  that over the years of NP [National Party] rule" the police  "developed into an authority into itself, bent on protecting  party political interests rather than society" and becasue  "South Africa has no history of ministerial accountability."  "Accountability must be forced on De Klerk, Kriel and their  generals by the masses who have had to bear the pain of the  government's distain for black human life."  <H5>  BEELD </H5>   Zulu King Raising Temperatures in Natal -- The Johannesburg  BEELD in Afrikaans of 22 March points out in a page 14  editorial: "King Goodwill Zwelithini has driven the political  pressure in Natal higher with his announcement on Friday  regarding the restoration of the Zulu kingdom -- not because he  is fighting for the maintenance of the Zulu kingdom, but because  he is holding out to his subjects the threat of protest against  the election as a means of achieving his goal. There must be  millions of Zulus in Natal who pledge loyalty to their king, but  who want to vote and want the election to take place. Where  will his call leave them? King Goodwill and his great advisor,  Mr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi, have the fullest right to fight for  the preservation of the Zulu culture and traditions. But they  have no right to deny other Natalians and Zulu subjects and the  rest of South Africa the right to exercise their democratic  right. The king, Mr. Buthelezi, and the rest of South Africa who  are watching kwaZulu-Natal with bated breath, must know that  the ANC will not accept the king's call for an election boycott  lying down. Indeed, they are already making plans for mass  action and other disruptive activities." "In kwaZulu-Natal the  result will be much bloodier and messier that in Bophuthatswana,  but the outcome will be the same," and "the party to benefit  most will be the ANC."    Vote for All Prisoners A Mistake -- "The unrest in prisons  in which prisoners demonstrated in support of participation in  the election by all criminals behind bars can be seen as the  fruits of an unfortunate compromise," says an editorial on page  8 of the Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans of 23 March. "What  those who support the vote for criminals forget is that  imprisonment is imposed with the aim of totally removing the  offender from society for a period. During that time his rights  as a member of society are withdrawn; it includes the right to  participate in political activities. The argument being raised  by the ANC, that it is unjust to prevent some prisoners from  exercising their most basic right -- the vote -- does not hold  water. The right to vote is not the most basic right; that  right is the right to life, and it is that right which the  majority of the criminals sentenced to death denied to others."  "The granting of the vote to all imprisoned criminals merely  compounds what is already an awful mistake."    Caution Needed Over Police Generals -- A second editorial on  the same page notes: "We would Nike to believe that State  President F.W. de Klerk, when he ordered three of the country's  top generals to take compulsory leave following the release of  the Goldstone report, did not act without very good reason. The  allegations against the generals are very serious, but it is  precisely for that reason that we have an uneasy feeling about  the course of events during the investigation by Justice  Goldstone." "A very important principle in law is that every  person must be given the opportunity to fully state his side of  the case, which was apparently not done here. In addition the  generals were not provided with legal assistance and they were  not given the opportunity to cross-examine the people who  presented evidence against them. So we ask: go steady with wild  accusations and allegations. Hold a full investigation in which  the law is properly applied, before crucifying people."    Culture of Lawlessness Being Created -- A third editorial  points out: "One of the most deplorable statements heard in the  election campaign comes from Mr. George Biya, president of the  Azanian Youth Organziation. Mr. Biya praised the looters who  stole goods during the uprising in Bophuthatswana. His  justification for this is: `No white man arrived from Europe  with a refrigerator or a bed. On the contrary, our people only  took what was theirs, and no apology is made.' Should one wish  to sink to the same level as Mr. Biya, one could point out that  it is precisely because of this kind of mentality by too many  too often in Africa that the continent finds itself in the state  it is." "Black entrepreneurs and the general public are daily  victims of looting in its various forms, encouraged by people  like Mr. Biya who are helping to create a culture of  lawlessness. Real leaders will have to take note that South  Africans of all colors are sick and tired of any form of  hooliganism."</p>

			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Property: Leaseholders get their big chance - Gerald Cadogan examines a bill, passed by MPs this week, that could change the face of central London THE CENTRAL London property market faces its biggest potential change for two centuries when the Housing and Urban Development Bill receives royal assent in the summer. This new law will allow many leaseholders of flats to buy their freeholds, and extends greatly the existing opportunities for a leaseholder of a whole house to do the same. Although the great London estates oppose the bill, it has rattled through the House of Commons and had its third reading this week. Opposition in the House of Lords could be strong but the Queen will have no problem assenting as Crown property is exempt (although the exemption probably will be waived), as are the National Trust and housing trusts. The bill maintains the level of complexity traditional in leaseholds, with plenty of 'grey areas' to provide work for valuation surveyors. If you, or the group of lessees in your building, are contemplating enfranchisement (lawspeak for becoming freeholders), you will be wise to hire one who knows the local conditions. Enfranchisement began with the Leasehold Reform Act 1967, which the Labour government introduced to help Welsh miners facing eviction. 'It was a radical change in tenant-landlord legislation,' says lawyer David Neuberger QC. 'For the first time, A could acquire property compulsorily from B when it was not for the public good.' Most central London houses were too valuable to qualify, but the Housing Act 1974 raised the limits for them following the general re-rating in 1973. The present rules are that the property must be a house and your principal residence for at least three years. The original lease must be 'long' (more than 21 years), the ground rent low, and the rateable value below Pounds 1,500 - or just above that if you can show that the marginal added value came from improvements you had made as tenant (leaseholder). These conditions are stringent. An alternative is for leaseholders to apply for a 50-year extension beyond the original date of expiry. There is no capital cost for this but, when the 50 years begin, the ground rent is set at a 'modern' (meaning high) rate with a review in 25 years, and the leaseholder loses the right to buy the freehold. The new bill keeps this 50-year option for houses that still qualify under the 1967/1974 rules. For enfranchising, the bill scraps the Pounds 1,500 rateable value limit. The new test is that when the lease began, the original ground rent must have been two-thirds or less of the then rateable value or; for a lease granted after April 1, 1990, the ground rent must not have been been over Pounds 1,000. This relaxation will slowly lead to the enfranchisement of many houses above the old rateable value limit on leases of 50 or 60 years, granted long before the recent inflation of property prices prompted landlords to push up ground rents. Some landlords have raised ground rents to as much as 1.5 or 2.25 per cent of the market value, but it is now only the initial ground rent which counts in the criteria for enfranchisement. The bill also extends enfranchisement to flats, with further provisos. The building must have two or more of them with at least two-thirds on long leases. In turn, two-thirds of those must agree to enfranchisement and make a collective application through a nominee purchaser, which might well be a company in which they all hold shares. If the landlord lives in the building, there is no case for enfranchisement  -unless it is a purpose-built block (not a conversion) with more than four flats. And if more than 10 per cent of the building is non-residential (a shop or garage, perhaps), again there is no case. But flat leaseholders do not have to meet the three-year main residence rule for houses. They need only a qualifying interest in the flat, and can have their main residence elsewhere. A business could own it. Flats that do not qualify may be able to buy a 90-year extension of the lease with a peppercorn ground rent at market value. The procedure for enfranchising is this: 1. Get a valuation from a surveyor and agreement among the leaseholders. 2. Serve a Tenants' Discovery Notice (optional) on the landlord requesting details of the freeholder and all people with a proprietary interest in the building. 3. Serve a Tenants' Purchase Notice on the freeholder and any intermediate landlords, as the leaseholders have to buy out all superior interests. (This means they will, collectively and expensively, become the new freeholders for any leaseholders in the building who do not wish to share in the buy-out). This notice gives the proposed price, commits the leaseholder(s) to paying the costs of the other parties from this point, and names a date at least two months ahead by which the freeholder must reply. Stage 4 is the freeholder's counter-notice, which might agree with, or dispute, some or all of the terms. If most leases are within five years of expiring, and he can show he intends to re-develop the site (difficult for listed buildings in conservation areas), he can invalidate the claim. If there are non-qualifying flats or parts of the building, such as garages or tenanted shops, he must say if he wishes to exercise a new right to a leaseback of those parts for 999 years. If he does not, then the leaseholders will have to pay the cost of buying out these freeholds also and will receive the rents (This might be more than the leasholders can afford). Negotiation follows. If the parties disagree, the case goes to the county court or, if about price, to the Leasehold Valuation Tribunal, with appeal on points of law to the Lands Tribunal. This is a simplification of a difficult law packed with exceptions to delay or complicate proceedings, and cut-off dates which must be observed. The freeholders will use them to the full, as they do not wish to lose their properties. For leaseholders, it will be a struggle, with sleepless nights and anguish. Is this worth it? And will they in the end have the money to buy the freehold? The cost to the leaseholders will be the sum of the open-market value of the freeholder's interest in the property, plus at least 50 per cent of the 'marriage value' (the increase in total value which results from amalgamating freehold and leashold interests) plus any amounts for 'injurious affection' to recompense the freeholder for a forced sale and costs. You can be sure that surveyors for either side will begin with differing estimates. Some leaseholders will fail to complete the process 'But it is no longer a landlord's market,' says Charles Boston, of surveyor Francis Russell. He advises potential purchasers: 'Speak to your landlord now; he might sell you a long lease at attractive terms.' But Boston adds: 'Make sure you have good advice in case what looks like an attractive proposition isn't'</p>

			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Leading Article: Cars and quotas YESTERDAY'S agreement to cut by 9.4 per cent the export of Japanese cars and light commercial vehicles to the European Community in 1993 provoked equal and opposite expressions of anguish from Japan and Europe. That may mean the negotiators, operating within the terms of a 1991 understanding, have got the deal about right. But it remains highly unsatisfactory that the community is committed to annual quota-trading of this kind, even if the intended goal is the desirable one of a wholly free market by the turn of the century. It was bound to be the case that these negotiations would lead to guesswork and anomalies. The first guess is the size of the EC market. Officials finally agreed a forecast of a fall in sales of 6.5 per cent from 1992 to 1993. Others suggest the drop could be as steep as 10 per cent, which could therefore involve Japan increasing its European market share. European manufacturers protest that such an outcome would violate what they claim to be the spirit of the 1991 agreement regarding the share to be taken by EC and Japanese manufacturers of growth and contraction in the market. Then there is the still vexed issue of Japanese-owned car manufacturing plants in Europe, notably in Britain. Again, the EC manufacturers say that the 1993 deal is unfair, since a drop in Japanese imports of 113,000 vehicles will be more than offset by an increase in transplant production of at least 150,000. In 1991 the British government ostensibly won the argument that Japanese transplants should not affect annual import quotas. In the event, they do seem to have been taken into account in the specific Japanese export limits announced yesterday for the five member states which prior to 1991 operated national restrictions on Japanese imports - France, Italy, Spain, Portugal and the UK. All of these countries will have to absorb a significant increase in Japanese imports, but easily the largest is that of the UK, where the quota rises by 20 per cent to 202,800. This presumably represents the revenge of the European motor industry on the UK's hospitality towards Japanese vehicle builders. It is particularly ironic that this campaign against Japanese transplants has been joined again recently by Ford, which appears not to recognise itself as a transplant of an earlier generation, albeit one with significantly deeper industrial roots in Europe than the Japanese newcomers. This is hardly a promising start for an agreement that will govern the fortunes of the EC motor industry to the end of the decade. The more ground given in each annual negotiation, the less likely that the objective of an open market will be reached. Through this anti-competitive fog, the EC motor industry is supposed to accelerate towards matching Japanese performance. That, as this week's news from Volkswagen confirms, remains the real endgame.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nikita Vaynonen: "Isn't the Game on `Single </F> Information Space' Going Through One Gate?"]    [Text] Let's begin with the statistics. About 120 million  Russians live in Russia, and about 30 million citizens belong to  other nationalities. Of these 30 million, slightly fewer than a  third--nearly 9 million--comprise immigrants from the former  union republics of the USSR. In other words, of every dozen  Russians, one is connected in some way with those lands now  known as the near abroad. He is connected by bad memories  sometimes, unfortunately. But basically the number cited--one in  a dozen--is made up, understandably, not of Russian immigrants  but of Ukrainians, Belarusians, Kazakhs, Armenians, Azeris,  Moldovans, Georgians, Uzbeks, Lithuanians, Latvians, Estonians,  Kyrgyz, Turkmen, and Tajiks. This somewhat unusual order of  listing is by decreasing number of representatives of these  peoples within the borders of Russian territory. The largest  group living in Russia are the Ukrainians--4.4 million. The  fewest of all are the Turkmen--about 40,000. Major diasporas  include the Belarusians, 1.2 million, the Kazakhs, 0.64 million,  the Armenians, 0.5 million, and the Azeris, 0.34 million. There  are a little over 100,000 Georgians and Moldovans each. The  majority of the peoples of the former union republics are  represented in Russia by the same number of citizens as the  population of a major city might comprise.    Does the Russian state remember that these people too have  national feelings and interests? These people do not make up  republics or autonomies, as do other nationalities residing in  Russia, nor are they demanding this. Thus it is even more  pointless to ignore their demands. Above all for information.  Nationality-group societies and confessional organizations might  concern themselves at least somewhat with the cultural,  religious, and educational requirements and needs of their  fellow tribesmen, but it is beyond the powers of such  organizations to arrange for issuing periodicals, to say nothing  of radio and television. The old information connections have  been completely disrupted. It used to be in Moscow a person  could easily subscribe to or purchase republic newspapers and  magazines, radio and television broadcast programs produced in  the union republics, and all kinds of festivals, TV bridges, and  so forth, were organized. Of course, in all this there was,  often even overwhelmingly, a degree of falsity, mere show,  deceptive and self-serving propaganda, which is in fact why the  "single information space" collapsed. But in starting to talk  now about reestablishing it, it is clearly useful to account  clearly for the reality that has formed in its stead.    The heirs of the union's former so-called Central TV and  Radio--the Russian federal TV-radio companies--have reoriented  themselves wholly toward Russia, and only Russia. Even if some  of the content in the broadcasts were especially calculated for  our neighbors and they felt like seeing or hearing something,  neither side would have the money to make that happen. According  to world practice, it is the receiving country that pays for the  technical provision and the right to transmit broadcasts from  another state. Here we have it the other way around. The  director for international communications of the VGTRK  [All-Russian State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company],  Sergey Yerofeyev, informed the RIA [Russian Information Agency]  that, except for Belarus, Turkmenistan, and a few other  countries of the CIS, which undertook the expense themselves  (and only for the transmission), the other states of the near  abroad have informed the company that they cannot pay to  disseminate Russian TV and radio programs. Nor are the Russian  TV and radio companies themselves in a position to do this any  longer; they don't have the money to run them to their own  country. The picture with the periodic press is analogous.    Let us turn our attention to this, however. The  above-mentioned announcement by VGTRK's director for  international communications stresses that the company is still  trying to pay for transmission beyond the borders of Russia,  since it is concerned about the interests of the 20 million  Russians in the near abroad, for whom television and radio are  the "sole channel for direct and vital contact with Russia," and  since "it would be a tragedy if the last connecting thread were  to break off." This is so, undoubtedly, and the appropriate  efforts must be redoubled, although in no instance can one count  merely on the enthusiasm of the television companies, which  without the support of the president and the government are  simply powerless to do anything. I still wonder, though: Why  does the director for international communications,  while worrying about his fellow countrymen abroad, not even  mention the 9 million other fellow countrymen of his who are  living in Russia but are linked by blood to her neighbors? Why  does he say nothing about that every twelfth Russian who in the  correspondence page indicated that he was a Ukrainian, or a  Turkmen, or an Armenian, or a Moldovan, or an Estonian. . . .  Least of all do I wish to reproach S. Yerofeyev personally. This  is just the old habit of thinking about information connections  as primarily one-sided.    Inside the Soviet empire, Russia (or more precisely, Moscow)  was the center, sending out "necessary" information to an entire  one-sixth of the world, but hardly ever receiving it. The "back  connection" scarcely enjoyed equal rights. Now the "situation"  has changed, but the psychology has not. To some frankly, but to  the majority subconsciously, the "single information space"  means the Russian space, which just creates additional grounds  to reproach us for imperial ambitions. In Moscow it is much  easier to buy a newspaper from the United States or Japan, or  pick up a broadcast from London or Paris, than to read, watch,  or hear information from Kiev or Tallinn, Tbilisi or Bishkek.    Usually you can still pick up radio from the nearer  capitals,  but the Trans-Caucasus and Central Asia are virtually  inaccessible to radio listeners, and there's not even a dream of  TV broadcasts from them.    Is something being undertaken to change the situation?    The Mir TV-radio company has been created. It was conceived  as CIS-wide, but its technical and creative possibilities do not  allow it to proceed, understandably, in any way comparable with  the former union Central TV and Radio. For the most part it  broadcasts "from Russia with love"; analogous broadcasting into  Russia is nil.    Last December, at a meeting in Ashkhabad between CIS heads  of  state, a decision was passed to create a weekly entitled "The  CIS: A Common Market." This February, representatives of the  Commonwealth countries' economic departments signed founding  documents on the publication of this newspaper. They were  supposed to club together to finance and distribute it in all  the shareholder states. Everything seemed decided. But there  still isn't a "single common CIS publication"! As was reported  at RF [Russian Federation] Roskompechat [Russian Committee for  the Press], it isn't even registered, inasmuch as Roskompechat  has temporarily halted registration. An unimportant but eloquent  detail: once again, everything is being decided (or not decided)  in Moscow.    What does the situation look like "from the other side,"  from  the countries of the near abroad? How do immigrants from there  who are living in Russia learn about events going on there?  <H5>  Vadim Dolganov, press-attache, Ukrainian Embassy, Moscow: </H5>   Two newspapers are published in Russia for Ukrainians. The  Association of Ukrainians in Moscow and Russia puts out  UKRAINSKIY VYBOR, and the Slavutich society puts out UKRAINSKIY  KURYER. The former comes out more or less regularly, something  you cannot say about the latter, unfortunately. There are many  problems with their publication, which are extremely difficult  to resolve, primarily due to a shortage of money. For this  reason, the Promin radio station has ceased to broadcast to  Russia. I want to emphasize that it is merely a matter of money,  and any attempts to drag politics in here have no foundation  whatsoever. Information links must be restored as quickly as  possible because there are so many misunderstandings on these  grounds, and as a result the mass media, instead of aiding  mutual understanding, often hinder it. Our ambassador, Vladimir  Kryzhanovskiy, recently met with the editors-in-chief of the  Russian newspapers. All of them supported his proposal that  within the CIS, at the level of prime minister, an agreement is  necessary on mutual obligations to facilitate the exchange of  information in every way possible. So far that information is  often not objective. We frequently write about one another the  way we used to write about America: Oh, they're lynching Negroes  there, and in Chicago it's nothing but gangsters. It was  reported, for example, that in Sevastopol all the schools were  switching to Ukrainian. But that's not true! The press is  supposed to reduce, not compress the tension. The Intersputnik  system is not being utilized now. Broadcasts to Ukraine could go  over that, and from there at least to the regions of Russia  where Ukrainians live in large numbers--Tyumen, the Far East,  Moscow, and St. Petersburg.  <H5>  Anatoliy Goreglyad, press-attache, Embassy of the Republic </H5> of Belarus:    As far as I know, there are still no newspapers or magazines  in the Belarusian language in Russia. The Batkovshchina society  came out as the initiator for such a publication, and it is  registered with Roskompechat, but it has not yet started to come  out. Even we in the embassy get newspapers from Minsk with great  difficulty, and only through Internal Affairs Ministry channels.  The picture is the same with Russian newspapers in Belarus.  These problems cannot be solved until the issue of Belarus's  entry into the ruble zone is decided.  <H5>  Regina Minaylova, cultural advisor, Embassy of the Republic </H5> of Belarus:    Belarusians come to the embassy asking to read our ZVEZDA or  our NARODNAYA GAZETA. The Batkovshchina Society is organizing a  subscription in Minsk for Muscovite Belarusians, but the  shipping is terribly expensive. There is no retransmission of  broadcasts from Belarusian radio in Russia (nor is there of the  radio of the other former union republics--Ed.), and it can be  very hard to pick up Minsk. As far as I know, soon after the  election of Mecheslav Grib as chairman of the Supreme Council of  Belarus, President Yeltsin suggested to him that the single  cultural space be revived within the CIS and a corresponding  agreement and committee be set up to deal with issues of  culture, science, education, and information. This is absolutely  essential!  <H5>  David Demetrashvili, press-attache, Georgian Embassy: </H5>   It's hard to say how many Georgians there are in Russia now.  After all, a large number of refugees have been added! In Moscow  and St. Petersburg, GRUZIYA: SOBYTIYA, LYUDI in Russian, is  being distributed. Two issues have come out. There is nothing in  Georgian. After all, though, Russians need to know the truth  about Georgia, too! In their reports on Georgia, unfortunately,  the Russian media often commit blunders.  <H5>  Nikolay Martyanov, head of the Foreign Economic Activity </H5> Department, Roskompechat:    The assistance program for ethnic Russians in the near  abroad  provides for duty-free shipment of publications for them,  duty-free supply of printing equipment, and paper for printing  newspapers, magazines, and books in Russian there. The same  needs to be done to help put out publications intended for  representatives of other ethnic groups residing in Russia. This  could be done on a reciprocal basis.  <H5>  Lavrentiy Mikhaylov, head, International Cooperation </H5> Administration, Roskompechat:    The restoration of contacts and the conclusion of bilateral  and multilateral agreements on information exchange inside the  CIS and with other countries of the former USSR is a matter of  great importance for Roskompechat. At the suggestion of the  Belarusian side (we had wanted to make the same one, but they  beat us to it), a meeting is planned for representatives of the  press and of the appropriate government departments of the  countries of the CIS to discuss the exchange of publications and  mutual assistance and cooperation in the sphere of the press and  information. The meeting is proposed for May.  <H8>  * * * </H8>   Unfortunately, we were unable to find anything out about  similar plans in the area of TV and radio, since on the Russian  side there is simply no one working on that as yet. The Federal  Television and Radio Broadcasting Service, which was formed by  presidential edict, has yet to be created as a practically  functioning organ.    Let us sum up. Everyone we were able to talk with is in  favor  of a single information space. The Russia's economic situation,  however, and especially that of its poorer neighbors, allows no  hope that in the near future we will even be able to approach  the scale this space enjoyed formerly. Efforts at the state  level are scattered and weak and do not go much beyond good  intentions. For all intents and purposes, there is no  information market across the former Union. The absence of a  full-blooded, healthy exchange of information is becoming a  major reason behind many conflicts and tensions. Russians abroad  may still be at least partially informed about affairs in their  homeland, but non-Russians in Russia are virtually not at all  about events at home. The circulations of the two Ukrainian and  one Georgian newspapers mentioned do not cover even a hundredth  of their potential readers, and there is no information at all  about publications for representatives of other nationalities in  Russia.    And finally. A request not to reproach the author for the  weakness of the constructive part. Many suggestions could be  made, and some have already been heard in conversations.  Everyone speaks with enthusiasm on "what is to be done." But  nothing is done. The main thing is that all gazes are once again  turned toward Russia, whereas the Russians themselves, while  treating outside initiative quite jealously, are manifesting  their own initiative meagerly. As well as one-sidedly,  concerning themselves only about Russians abroad. As David  Demetrashvili correctly noted, the idea of creating a network of  information media for non-Russians in Russia is topical and very  necessary. If, I might add, the game goes through the same gates  as before, the creation of a new information space, where all  "players" are on an equal footing, will not even be able to get  started.</p>

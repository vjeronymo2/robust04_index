			<p>BFN     [Text] Violent clashes were reported inside N'dalatando  yesterday with the MPLA-PT [Popular Movement for the Liberation  of Angola-Labor Party] air force dropping napalm, toxic, and  highly explosive bombs throughout the day. Entire buildings  have been destroyed. Yesterday afternoon the city was covered  with a huge cloud of smoke. Corpses of civilians have been  lying on the streets since the past five days. Our  correspondent says the combat readiness of National Union for  the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] forces remains high.</p>

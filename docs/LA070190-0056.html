			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: WATERED DOWN?  </P> <P> Thanks, but no thanks. That's what the U.S. Navy first told Orion Pictures,  when the studio inquired about Naval cooperation in the making of its  action-adventure, "Navy SEAL."  </P> <P> The reason: the script -- in which the elite Sea Air and Land combat team goes  into action in the Middle East -- didn't pass muster.  </P> <P> Capt. Michael Sherman, director of the Navy Office of Information, West, tells  us that, as originally written, Charlie Sheen's maverick-type character would  have been court-martialed. "None of us would have put up with that kind of  behavior from a junior officer," Sherman says. "He was belligerent and  unprofessional beyond the bounds of professionalism."  </P> <P> After script revisions that resulted in a "toned-down, more believable"  character, the U.S. Navy agreed to provide "limited cooperation," allowing the  film crew to shoot for three days at the Naval base at Norfolk, Va.  </P> <P> Although the film takes dramatic license with certain aspects of the Navy --  including truncated SEAL training time and relationships among the officers  that are "a little fast and loose" -- Sherman says "there are no hard feelings  between the Navy and Orion."  </P> <P> Next week, in fact, the Navy will put on a special SEAL demonstration for the  press, tied to the film's July 20 opening.  </P> <P> "Obviously, we get some benefits from any movie that depicts the military,"  Sherman explains. "After 'The Hunt for Red October' came out, there was  interest in working on submarines. With 'SEAL,' I'm sure we'll be hearing from  kids who are good in the water." Pat H. Broeske  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ukraine's Defense Ministry has so far given no  consideration to Russia's program alternative to NATO's  Partnership for Peace scheme, Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaly  Radetsky said.    "We are still working out our vision" of the North Atlantic  alliance's scheme, whose implementation poses "many problems"  for Ukraine, Radetsky told Interfax-Ukraine on Wednesday. One  of the problems is that Ukraine's military doctrine prevents it  from joining any blocs, he said.</p>

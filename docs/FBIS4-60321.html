			<p>BFN     [Text] The Command of the Defense Ministry has announced  the following:    In a misleading attempt to justify the atrocious and  criminal  acts embarked upon by the separatist al-Ahmar gang and the  terrorist forces in Sanaa who launched rockets against peaceful  citizens in Aden's civilian quarters which resulted in atrocious  massacres of which scores of people -- children, women, and the  elderly -- were victims, the north's news media have announced  that a rocket was launched against Sanaa this evening [as  heard]. They fabricated these explosions as they have become  accustomed to fabricating many things to counter their own cheap  acts and activities.    The Ministry of Defense in the Democratic Republic of Yemen  categorically denies any responsibility for such an act.  Citizens are not a target for any military action. It now  appears that this gang is no longer able to do anything except  to direct destruction against every house in Yemen. This is  because it sparked off the war against the people.    The Ministry of Defense in Aden warns against such criminal  acts and misleading justifications. The lives of the citizens  will not be as cheap as the advocates of war and crime believe.  They have plunged thousands of people, even minor ones, into a  dirty war which does not serve anybody except their narrow and  selfish interests.</p>

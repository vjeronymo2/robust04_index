Aliyev will hold talks with  President Suleyman Demirel and several officials in that  country. What do our people expect from his visit?    Azerbaijan's Turkic people have a problem at the present  time. A way must be found to end the war in the Republic, which  has continued for six years. A way must be found to quickly end  the aggression and fighting. The Armenian military forces must  withdraw from the territories they have occupied in Azerbaijan.  In short, Azerbaijan's people want the aggressor to be punished  and peace and security to be reestablished.    Undoubtedly, neighboring countries must give support to  Azerbaijan to help it end the Armenian aggression. That is  essential. They must help us convey Azerbaijan's just and  honest views to the world.    Turkey is one of the countries that help Azerbaijan  establish  peace and security on its territory. That country has  significant political influence in the world. In view of that,  we have vested significant hope in Turkey's support for  Azerbaijan's effort to sign a peace agreement to quickly end the  war. The hope we have vested in Turkey is based on many things.  The language, religion, and traditions of the two peoples are  very similar. We have a common language, religion, history, and  literature. The two peoples have been attacked throughout  history. They have waged a joint struggle against the enemy.    We wish to recall the tragic incidents the Armenians created  in Azerbaijan early in the century. Drawing strength from their  supporters, the Dachnak Armenians carried out bloody massacres  in Azerbaijan. Armenian terrorist activities were widespread in  our Republic. Turkey extended a helping hand to Azerbaijan's  people at the time. It took an active part in the effort our  people made to evict the Dachnak Armenians from our territory.  However, the Dachnak Armenians took action once again 70 years  later. Their new action is based on many reasons. You may ask  why the Turkic peoples do not move against a handful of  Armenians? It is common knowledge that the Armenians have never  been alone in their bloody crimes against the Turkic peoples.  Powerful and influential countries have always supported them  behind the scenes. The Armenians have been used as an  instrument.    The Armenians also created tragic incidents in Turkey. They  wished to divide that country early in the century. However,  Kemal Ataturk, founder of modern Turkey, succeeded in creating  unity in that country and achieved victory.    It is as if history is repeating itself. Aggressive circles  have drawn up bloody designs against Azerbaijan's Turkic people.  They wish to divide and fragment Azerbaijan to usurp its  resources. However, they will not realize their objectives.  Azerbaijan's sons have arisen. That has been confirmed by our  national Army's recent victories.    Turkey is the only country whose policy toward Azerbaijan  complies with its intentions. Several of Azerbaijan's neighbors  maintain a biased approach on the fighting in our Republic.  Vague and deliberate reports are frequently published in their  newspapers. In fact, several of them claim that Karabakh is a  historic Armenian territory and argue that the pressure on the  Armenians in Karabakh kindled the war in the region. [passage  omitted]    It would be better if the neighboring countries helped  Azerbaijan at this difficult time to convey its just and honest  views to the world. That is because Azerbaijan needs moral  support more than material aid. Deliberately vague views  confuse the international community.    It must be stressed that the Armenians have occupied more  than 20 percent of Azerbaijan's territory and more than  1,000,000 peaceful residents have become refugees. Turkey has  been the only country to convey our just and honest views to the  international community and to take serious action in  international organizations. In view of that, we are convinced  that President Aliyev's official visit to Turkey will further  enhance the cultural unity and friendly relations between the  two countries. We are also convinced that Turkey will expose  the true nature of the Armenian aggression to the international  community.    We wish success to President Aliyev. We hope that the  outcome of his visit will be successful and auspicious.</p>

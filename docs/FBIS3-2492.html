This Saturday is the first one for years for urban people in  China to take as a rest-day.    It results from the country's new working-hours system: from  March 1 workers and government employees work five and half days  a week (44 hours) rather than six days (48 hours). For many  employees it means that every second weekend they get two days  off, and in the intervening week just the Sunday -- in other  words, an 11-day fortnight.    "I often could not sleep well as I had to take care of my  baby and did the housework as well," said nurse Xiao. "But since  I can rest for two continuous days now, I feel my burden eased.  I can put off some things to do until tomorrow."    Lin Yi, who works in a print company in Beijing, summoned  her  boyfriend early this morning. She said they were going to spend  this day in Beijing Botanic Garden and Beijing Zoo.    "It was really not easy for me to get a date with my  boyfriend since I am usually very busy," she said.    Many people chose to spend today in stores and parks.  Managers of major stores in Xidan Shopping Center and staff at  the Summer Palace reported more people coming than usual. They  said the new system provided a new business opportunity for them.    "The new working-hour system will be good for our business,"  said an executive of the Summer Palace. "We were thinking of new  ways to attract more people. And now the opportunity has come."    In Nanjing, capital of East China's Jiangsu Province, tens  of  thousand people, four to five times the usual number, flocked to  see plums on a hill in an eastern suburb of the city. The  number of visitors to many other scenic spots in the city  evidently increased and department stores were overfilled.    "I seldom have a chance to tour the city," said Cao Rong,  who  works in Dachang town, about two hours from urban Nanjing.  "Although I had been to the plum mountain before, I feel more  relaxed today."    The new system also provides a chance for some people to  take  a second job.    Chen Yong, a computer operator in a Beijing hotel, opened  his  own company. He used to worry because he could not find enough  time for his private business, but today he went to his own  company early in the morning.    However, not all urban residents spent today as a rest day.  In Nanjing University, Zhang Rong and his colleagues were still  doing their scientific research on semi-conductors.    "It does not mean much for us who engage in scientific  research although the rest days increased," said a teacher, who  identified herself only as Gao, at the Beijing Polytechnical  University. "The real rest day is after our success (in our  research)."    In Beijing, hospitals, public bus companies and stores still  operate as normally. Officials said it was guaranteed that  workers of these businesses will work only 44 hours a week and  take their rest-time by changing working shifts.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "French-Belgian Demon at Catholic University of </F> Louvain"]    [Text] Louvain-la-Neuve--It is French-Belgian, it was made  to travel, and it has been mischievously christened Demon.  Despite its name, this equipment, which should shed new light on  the mechanisms of the reactions produced by the collision of  heavy ions, was officially inaugurated at the Nuclear Physics  Institute (IPN) of the Catholic University of Louvain-la-Neuve  on 28 October.    The ceremony was attended by several dozen physicists and  engineers, among them Claude Detraz, director of the Institute  of Nuclear Physics and Particle Physics (IN2P3) of France's CNRS  [National Scientific Research Center], and individuals  responsible for designing and developing the detector: Mr.  Youssef, Mr. Masri, and Francis Hanappe, who are researchers at  Belgium's National Scientific Research Fund (FNRS); and Guy  Bizard and Bernard Heusch of the CNRS.    Designed to be easily disassembled and moved, Demon (Modular  Neutron Detector) was financed equally by the IN2P3/CNRS and the  FNRS (20 million Belgian francs each) and built at four  laboratories: the nuclear physics laboratories at the Free  University of Brussels and the University of Louvain-la-Neuve,  the Corpuscular Physics Laboratory (LPC) in Caen, and the  Nuclear Research Center (CRN) in Strasbourg. The result is that  following a preliminary series of measurements scheduled for  December with Cyclone (the IPN's cyclotron), Demon will be  transferred to GANIL (Large National Heavy Ion Accelerator) in  Caen in 1994 and then to Vivitron in Strasbourg in 1995.    Demon's designers emphasize that it constitutes  "technological progress" chiefly because of the amount of  electronics and informatics it contains. In other words, it  could not have been built a few years ago. Demon also benefited  from work in the same field that was done by Charles Ring on the  Eurogam detector (used by Vivitron).    What are the limits to the existence of nuclei--that is,  what  is the maximum number of nucleons possible in a nucleus, what  are the respective proportions of neutrons and protons beyond  which or below which a nucleus is no longer stable, and to what  extent can one perturb a nucleus (by causing it to absorb  energy) before it explodes (the phenomenon of  multifragmentation)?    Demon should help provide answers to some of those  questions,  which still constitute an unsolved problem in nuclear physics.    Bernard Tamain of the LPC in Caen explains that in Louvain  (where Cyclone delivers beams of 10 MeV per nucleon of energy)  and in Strasbourg, the new apparatus, with its 96 detectors  (including liquid scintillator plus photomultiplier) mounted on  a spherical frame measuring four meters in  diameter,&lt;sup&gt; 1&lt;/sup&gt;  will be "a chronometer making it possible  to measure the fast fission of nuclei, the lifetime of a very  hot nucleus, and those `reflex' times of nuclear matter that  govern the fusion mechanisms." Its capabilities: times on the  order of 100th of a billionth of a billionth of a second.    In Caen, where the energy supplied to GANIL can reach 100  MeV  per nucleon, the new equipment will be able to track the hottest  nuclei up to temperatures of 100 billion degrees.    But Demon will also be used as a microscope for studying the  most "exotic" light nuclei (those presenting a large excess of  neutrons compared to the corresponding ordinary nuclei) that it  is possible to produce today, examples being lithium-11 and  carbon-19. Lastly, the new installation will make it possible to  measure neutron sizes down to one-billionth of a micrometer.    It will therefore be possible to begin neutron detection--a  difficult task compared to the detection of charged  particles--within a few weeks using the equipment in question,  which is unique in Europe.  <H5>  Hot Nuclei and Exotic Nuclei </H5>   When perturbed by another nucleus, a target nucleus  distributes the energy imparted to it among its components, the  nucleons. If the excitation energy reaches a certain threshold  and threatens its existence, the nucleus--which is then called  "hot"--"cools" itself by the emission of protons and neutrons  (the phenomenon of evaporation) or by fission into two or more  fragments (known as multifragmentation).    Studying the emission of neutrons enables one to learn about  the excitation energy achieved by the nuclei, their  de-excitation processes, and their lifetime (the time it takes  them to return to stability). The hotter the nucleus, the  stronger and faster the emissions.    Heavy ion accelerators can also produce light nuclei which,  unlike stable "ordinary" nuclei (in which the number of neutrons  is close to that of protons), have too many neutrons. Examples  are &lt;sup&gt; 11&lt;/sup&gt; Li (three protons, eight neutrons) and &lt;sup&gt; 19&lt;/sup&gt;  C (six protons, 13 neutrons). In an "exotic"  nucleus of that kind, neutrons will be randomly distributed in a  "halo," making the nucleus very unstable. The nucleus will  return to stability by emitting its least firmly bound neutrons.    Detecting two neutrons simultaneously and measuring their  speed (their "time of flight") and their angle of emission  provides information on the limits to the existence of nuclear  matter.  Footnotes    1. Twenty-four of those detectors, perfected by the CRN in  Strasbourg in cooperation with Philips-France (in  Brive-la-Gaillarde), are equipped with a Charged Particle  Rejection System (Syrep) that also includes a scintillator  combined with a photomultiplier.</p>

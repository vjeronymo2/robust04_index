			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / UK Company News: NFC Pounds 82.5m convertible bond issue NFC, the transport and distribution group, has issued Pounds 82.5m of convertible bonds to refinance part of its bank debt, writes Richard Waters. The bonds are convertible from March 1998 at 300p. The premium, 18.6 per cent over the share price of 253p yesterday, is marginally higher than the 16 per cent premium on the last convertible bond issue by a UK company, Carlton Communications. The bonds have a 15-year life and carry a coupon of 7 3/4 per cent - 1 1/2 per cent below the yield on UK gilts with a similar maturity.</p>

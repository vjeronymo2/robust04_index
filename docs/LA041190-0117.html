			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ENERGY FUTURES;  </P> <P> GLUT DRAGS OIL PRICES BELOW $18 A BARREL  </P> <P> Crude oil prices, depressed by bulging U.S. inventories and OPEC  overproduction, tumbled Tuesday to close below $18 a barrel for the first time  since August.  </P> <P> On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil futures for May delivery  finished at $17.68 a barrel, down 76 cents.  </P> <P> Expectations that an American Petroleum Institute report to be released late  Tuesday would show crude stocks buildups also contributed to the market's  already overwhelmingly bearish tone. The figures, released after the close of  trading, showed an 8-million barrel increase in crude oil stocks at 371 million  barrels. Crude stocks are a bearish 45 million barrels above their levels at  this time last year.  </P> <P> "We can reasonably expect a bounce to recover from this blood bath, but beyond  that the market looks like it's going to remain weak because production is  outpacing demand for the time being and storage space is so tight," United  Energy Inc. analyst Kevin Breslin said.  </P> <P> Heavy production by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is also  hitting world oil prices hard, according to traders who described the market as  fundamentally very weak.  </P> <P> North Sea Brent Blend, the most widely traded international crude, fell 65  cents, following a 75-cent drop on Monday, to $15.95 per barrel Tuesday.  </P> <P> Dubai, the key Middle East marker grade, was at $14.05 for May cargoes, down 50  cents from Monday and $1 below last Friday.  </P> <P> "A lot depends on OPEC deciding at some stage to curtail supply, which would  take time, but which would calm the market," one trader said.  </P> <P> "On the other hand a lot depends on consumption of oil products -- gasoline,  heating oil," the trader added, summing up the sentiment that has led to such  precipitous falls in prices worldwide.  </P></p>

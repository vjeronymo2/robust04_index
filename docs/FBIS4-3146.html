			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Philippe Massonnet] </F>   [Text] Beijing, April 18 (AFP)--China's economy slowed  slightly in the first quarter of the year but prices soared,  making the government's goal of keeping growth and inflation  below 10 percent this year hard to achieve.    Gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 12.7 percent in the  first quarter to 862 billion yuan (99 billion dollars), against  14.1 percent in the same period last year, and 13.4 percent for  the whole of 1993, according to the state bureau of statistics.    The slowing of the economy is mainly due to weaker  industrial  growth and more reasonable levels of fixed capital investment,  explained bureau spokesman Ye Zhen.    Industrial production rose by 16 percent, compared to 25  percent in the first quarter of 1993, while output in heavy  industry grew by 15.3 percent and light industry by 16.8 percent.    Fixed capital investment -- largely responsible for last  year's overheating of the economy which was controlled by  austerity measures -- grew by 36.2 percent, or at half the speed  of the same period last year.    "Generally speaking, there was a drop in the number of local  projects," said Ye.    "Economic growth has indeed slowed slightly, but it is still  running well above the eight or nine percent planned for this  year, making the government's task practically impossible," said  a western diplomat who specialises in economics. That opinion  is shared by most Chinese experts, who reckon on 12 percent  growth for the year.    "Most worrying is the authorities' inability to control  inflation, which is continuing to rise," added the diplomat.    In other comments, Ye said, "the main problem is the price  increase," referring to the 20-percent rise in prices across the  country compared with just eight percent during the 1993 first  quarter.    In the 35 largest cities, inflation measured an average 24.6  percent, with Haikou in Hainan province in the south of the  country, posting the worst result of 34.1 percent. Prices in  Beijing rose by 24.1 percent, while Shanghai, China's most  populous city, reported inflation of 23.3 percent.    Retail sales rose by 25.2 percent, two to three points less  than in the first quarter of last year.    "We can control the price rises if the local governments  implement the measures of the State Council," said Ye, adding  that the income of individuals after inflation still rose by 9.3  percent for city dwellers in the first quarter, and by 13.1  percent for peasants.    The government's other major problem is the unhealthy  condition of state enterprises, which only increased production  by 2.2 percent. Of these, 49.6 percent have lost money since  the beginning of the year, said Ye. Only one third of state  firms were in the same situation in the same period last year.    Some saw production decrease because of bad management,  while  others were hit by fiscal reforms which favour enterprises which  perform well, added the spokesman.    But he vowed the government would press on with its  liberalisation of the economy. "This year will be the year of  reforms," he said.</p>

			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Arts: Stafford-Clark bows out Max Stafford-Clark took his formal departure from London's Royal Court Theatre on Sunday after 14 years as artistic director, writes Malcolm Rutherford. A packed house saw a gala performance of scenes from plays he has put on over the years, including Serious Money by Caryl Churchill and Three Birds Alighting on a Field by Timberlake Wertenbaker. In future, Stafford-Clark will head a new company, Out of Joint. Its first venture will be a co-production with the Leicester Haymarket and the Royal Court of an adaptation of Sue Townsend's novel The Queen and I.</p>

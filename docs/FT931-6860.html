			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Mexico pressed over TV concessions THE Mexican government is coming under growing pressure to rule on the granting of concessions for 62 new local TV stations, which are reported to have gone to Televisa, Latin America's largest media company. Award of the concessions to Televisa would enable it to complete its third national network in Mexico, but threatens to complicate the sell-off of Mexico's state-owned TV channels 7 and 13, due to take place by June. Televisa already has about 80-90 per cent of Mexico's TV audience, and further expansion would make it much harder for the buyers of the two state-owned channels to compete. Newspaper reports have suggested the two state channels might fetch Dollars 500m. They would provide the only effective competition to Televisa, a self-proclaimed supporter of Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, in power for the past 63 years. One of the favoured bidders for the state-owned channels said: 'The government does not realise the importance of this. If they make the concessions it will be very difficult to compete. The most important part (of the privatisation) is the rules of future competition. We are obviously concerned.' Televisa has all but announced that it has been awarded the concessions. A spokesman said: 'We expect an announcement soon.' been promised the concessions. A communications ministry spokesman said a decision had still to be made. The government will soon have to confront Televisa's 'Plan Amigo', which gives free advertising spots to companies promising not to advertise elsewhere. Given Televisa's dominance of the TV market, the arrangement may make it hard for future competitors to entice advertisers away.</p>

UN control "will be achieved through permanent, on the  ground  UNPROFOR armed presence on five or six established sites on each  side where heavy weapons are regrouped," UN spokesman Ahmad  Fawzi told reporters in New York.    "If either party attempts to retrieve those weapons it will  have to use force and will therefore be in breach of the  accepted conditions. Force will in turn be used against it,"  Fawzi said.    Serbian and Bosnian Moslem forces are due to withdraw their  heavy weapons from a 20-kilometer (12-mile) radius of Sarajevo,  or hand them over to UN control, by 0000 GMT Sunday or risk NATO  airstrikes.    Bosnian Serbs said Thursday they would withdraw their heavy  weaponry in time, following an intervention by Russian President  Boris Yeltsin.</p>

			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / International Company News: Jennings and UK Paper 'mistakes' FLETCHER Challenge had made two serious mistakes, Mr Hugh Fletcher, chief executive, told a briefing, writes Terry Hall. One was in Jennings, the group's Australian subsidiary, which had required a 100 per cent writeoff of all debt and equity investments in the latest accounts. The other was in buying UK Paper. 'In hindsight we should not have acquired UK Paper.' He said operationally the British plants were running above expectations, helped by cost and staff reductions. Production of fine papers was up from 285,000 to 328,000 tonnes. 'But our strategy was based on the assumption that pulp prices would decline much more than European fine papers. This turned out to be woefully wrong. 'European paper price declines have been overpowering so while the long term strategy may have been right, the timing was abysmal.' He said UK Paper had lost NZDollars 107m (USDollars 57.8m) before interest and tax, and NZDollars 117m after tax in the past year. The international pulp and paper division lost NZDollars 94.9m, compared with a profit of NZDollars 288.3m last year. Mr Fletcher said pulp prices had passed their cyclical low, and were rising. Paper remained a large problem due to an abnormally big drop in newspaper and magazine advertising in the US. But again prices were improving.</p>

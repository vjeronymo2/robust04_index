			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / UK Company News: RTZ completes Colowyo deal at double the price RTZ Corporation, the mining company, has finally completed the acquisition, first announced in April, of most of the Colowyo Coal Company, which has a mine in Colorado, at a cost of Dollars 25.5m (Pounds 15.5m) cash, compared with the Dollars 13m originally intended. The seller, WR Grace, the US speciality chemicals and health care group, now receives Dollars 218.3m instead of Dollars 233m. RTZ said the deal remained a good one as Colowyo produced 4m tonnes a year of low sulphur, high-energy coal with about 180m tonnes of mineable reserves. The operations complemented those RTZ acquired last year in the Powder River Basin, which made it the fifth largest coal producer in the US. RTZ has not bought an interest in some long-term coal contracts, involving 60m tonnes of Colowyo reserves. Instead these have been used to secure non-recourse finance, which has given Grace Dollars 192.8m.</p>

			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Paisley boycott may deter businesses The Rev Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist party is to boycott next week's Northern Ireland investment conference. His announcement, made during the party's annual conference at Dungannon at the weekend, comes as little surprise. Mr Paisley remains implacably opposed to any contact with Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing. Once Downing Street had confirmed that Sinn Fein councillors on the Belfast and Derry economic committees had been invited to the investment conference, Mr Paisley's reaction was inevitable. The DUP's absence will nonetheless reinforce Ulster's image as a divided society, and could make it more difficult for the Northern Ireland Office to convince business that now is the time to invest in the province's future. Next week's conference is intended to be a showpiece for foreign investors, and to provide evidence that Ulster is ready to end its internal strife and forge a new consensus. One unionist councillor said: 'It's sad that this could upset the apple cart. Foreign investors will say 'if the parties can't sit down together, then why should we put our money here?' ' Yet many unionists are alarmed at the way London is seen to have 'bent over backwards' under US pressure to accommodate Sinn Fein. Unionist sensitivities have been aggravated by remarks by Mr Albert Reynolds, outgoing Irish prime minister, who warned over the weekend that Sinn Fein should not be treated as a 'second-class political party' in the peace process. He said: 'That sort of penny-pinching attitude risked sending the wrong signals to the Sinn Fein leadership.' His remarks help to reinforce the impression in unionist circles that the republicans are forcing the pace. 'It's all one way, isn't it. They're getting everything - we're getting nothing,' said a young Protestant woman in Belfast selling loyalist memorabilia to raise money for her husband and other loyalist prisoners. 'The republican prisoners will be out long before my man,' she said. In some respects, unionism itself seems to be in crisis. In working class communities Mr Paisley is no longer seen as offering a lead. His standing among the grass roots has been eclipsed by politicians such as Mr David Ervine and Mr Gary McMichael, and others close to the loyalist paramilitaries. In rural areas, and among middle class protestants, it is Mr James Molyneaux's Official Unionists who hold the ring. Mr Paisley's antics have seemed increasingly extreme in recent weeks. At the party's annual conference over the weekend he threatened to 'wreck' any new Northern Ireland assembly. 'If there is an election to any assembly here we will be fighting it, we will give the people of Northern Ireland the right to be represented there and we will use our position in that assembly to destroy that assembly,' Mr Paisley said. Going further, he hinted at moves to challenge the legality of the Downing Street declaration, signed by London and Dublin last December. The declaration provides the guidelines for the framework document which the two governments hope will form the basis for talks between Ulster's principal parties.</p>

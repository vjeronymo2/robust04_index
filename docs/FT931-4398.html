			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): A smelling salt for the market - Alice Rawsthorn asks whether Giorgio Armani's new fragrance can revive sluggish perfume sales Giorgio Armani threw a party in Manhattan last month. His party planners transformed a West 57th street basement into a replica of the theatre in his Milan palazzo, complete with a grove of citrus trees. The party was the climax of the Dollars 50m (Pounds 34.4m) launch of Gio, the women's perfume developed for Armani, the Italian fashion designer, by L'Oreal, the French cosmetics group. Gio has been on sale in Europe since the autumn and was introduced to the US last month. So far it is ahead of its European targets and has set records in the US. Saks Fifth Avenue, the New York store, sold Dollars 250,000-worth of Gio in its first three days. If Gio's success continues, L'Oreal should achieve its aim of creating a classic perfume and a brand name from which to launch other fragrances and cosmetics. But if its strategy falters and Gio loses momentum, L'Oreal's Dollars 50m gamble will have failed. Gio's progress is important not only to L'Oreal, but to the rest of the Dollars 13.1bn perfume industry which desperately needs a fillip after three grim years. The fragrance market has been destabilised not only by recession but by the recent expansion of the leading players: LVMH, the French luxury goods group, which launched Christian Lacroix perfume; Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products company, which bought Calvin Klein fragrances; and Elf-Sanofi, the French pharmaceuticals firm, which took over Yves Saint-Laurent in January. The development of Gio started two years ago when L'Oreal mapped out a new strategy for Giorgio Armani fragrances, which it acquired in 1989 as part of the takeover of Helena Rubinstein cosmetics. There were then two Armani perfumes - a men's scent with respectable, if unspectacular, annual sales of Dollars 50m and a women's fragrance with turnover of Dollars 10m. 'Giorgio Armani was an under-exploited asset,' said Georges Klarsfeld, head of L'Oreal's fine fragrance division. 'He is one of the world's most famous fashion designers with a classic, understated style that is just right for the 1990s. We weren't making the most of the Armani name.' L'Oreal began by finding a new product. It conducted 1,100 tests over 15 months to choose a scent which would appeal both in Europe and the US, where consumers tend to prefer stronger, less subtle smells. It eventually chose a blend of orange blossom and tuberose reflecting the current trend for natural, floral fragrances. 'Choosing the product is only part of the story,' said Klarsfeld. 'There are four components to a successful perfume - product, pricing, merchandising and advertising. It's a bit like playing the slot machines at Las Vegas. If you get four cherries you win the jackpot. If you get two or three you lose everything.' The 'jackpot' is to own one of the handful of classic perfumes, such as Chanel No5 or Tresor (launched three years ago by L'Oreal), which make annual sales of more than Dollars 120m. The profits are negligible initially because advertising typically absorbs 75 per cent of sales in the first year and 50 per cent in the second. But from the third year the advertising budget falls to 30 per cent of sales. Given that production costs are so small (less than 5 per cent) a classic then produces annual profits of around Dollars 80m. But the risk of failure is frighteningly high. The fragrance market is intensely competitive thanks to the combination of recession and the expansion of the large groups. Paine Webber in New York estimates that only a fifth of the fragrances launched today will recoup their launch costs within three years, compared with half six years ago. The industry is littered with corpses. LVMH is said to have lost Dollars 40m on C'est la Vie], launched four years ago for Christian Lacroix, the French designer. L'Oreal's last big flop, Clandestine by Guy Laroche, was withdrawn after only six months on the market. There is so much competition for distribution that L'Oreal could not risk jeopardising its relations with retailers. In theory Gio, which is pitched in the middle of the fine fragrance market with prices starting at Dollars 40, has the necessary ingredients for success. L'Oreal has the financial clout to support the launch; it is spending Dollars 50m on promotion for the first two years. The television commercials are made by director David Lynch and the press advertisements by Peter Lindbergh, fashion photographer. In Japan, where the scent market is still small, L'Oreal is in the surreal situation of planning to spend more on advertising in the first two years than it expects to make in sales. 'It sounds crazy,' said Klarsfeld. 'But we'll get our money back from duty-free sales to Japanese tourists.' L'Oreal is also investing heavily in merchandising. Armani, who receives a royalty on sales, has designed everything from the packaging to the display counters and sales assistants' uniforms. His involvement has encouraged retailers to support the launch. Saks Fifth Avenue devoted all 35 of its windows to Armani products. The designer made his first trip to New York for three years for the launch party, thereby attracting pages of free publicity in the US fashion press. Gio also has the advantage of being introduced at a time when there is a significant change in fashion - away from the slick styles of the 1980s, to the looser look of the 1990s - which could encourage consumers to try new scents. It should also benefit from the dearth of other large launches. Moreover, there are now signs of a recovery in the US fragrance market, although European sales are still sluggish. So far the omens are encouraging. But Klarsfeld has to wait a little longer to see whether Gio has hit all 'four cherries' on his slot machine. 'The real test will be whether people buy it again for its second Christmas,' he said. 'It's only then that we'll know if Gio is really a success.'  ----------------------------------------------------------             WORLDWIDE BEAUTY PRODUCTS MARKET*  ---------------------------------------------------------- Women's scents             Dollars 4.6bn (34.6%) Men's scents               Dollars 2.0bn (15.4%) Make-up                    Dollars 2.5bn (19.2%) Skincare                   Dollars 4.1bn (30.8%)  ---------------------------------------------------------- * wholesale prices in USDollars  for prestige market.  ----------------------------------------------------------        TOP SELLING WOMEN'S SCENTS IN US AND EUROPE:  ---------------------------------------------------------- 1.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Anne-Marie Mischke] </F>   [Text] Tension between the ANC parliamentary caucus and  party leaders in the cabinet could just be the thing that makes  Mr. Cyril Ramaphosa to say to himself: "I chose well when I  decided to serve the party rather than to sit in the cabinet."    He has been appointed chairman of a committee which has to  look into relationships between the cabinet, parliamentary  members, and ordinary ANC members. Amid tension between the  caucus and the cabinet, he is being regarded by certain caucus  members as the right man to be their leader.    Caucus members this week clearly expressed their discontent  about cabinet decisions made without consultation with them.  The days of "Yes Minister, No Minister, OK Minister" are gone,  one member told RAPPORT.    The cause of discontent this week was the fact that only a  small cabinet committee of four members has been appointed to  investigate the position of Cape Town and Pretoria as  parliamentary capitals. The caucus demands that a fully-fledged  parliamentary committee should investigate the matter.    Two weeks ago individual caucus members reacted angrily to  the cabinet's decision not to declare 16 June, Soweto Day, a  public holiday.    RAPPORT has already earlier reported on discontent within  the  caucus because of appointments made by President Mandela against  the will of the caucus. There was also a grouse over President  Mandela's failure to attend the first caucus meetings. Ever  since, say ANC members, he has only attended one caucus meeting.    Caucus members are also disgruntled that they were not  informed that the cabinet had appointed Mr. Trevor Manuel as  leader of the National Assembly. They maintain not only that  they should have given some input regarding the appointment, but  also that they should at least have been informed.    The ANC culture that leaders cannot make decisions on their  own has a long history. Since the organization was unbanned  four years ago, it has been insisted on that people at ground  level must be consulted on important decisions. The ANC caucus  is determined to continue with this culture.</p>

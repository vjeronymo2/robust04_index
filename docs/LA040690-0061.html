			<p><P> April 6, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'CIRQUE DU SUNDAY' RECOVERS WELL  </P> <P> Despite a rocky start, "Cirque du Sunday," the latest show from the Groundlings  second-stringers, isn't far behind the current efforts of the first-stringers.  </P> <P> An ineffective one-joke take-off on Cirque du Soleil opened the show Sunday.  </P> <P> Though it was followed by a quartet of sensitive wranglers singing a clever rap  ditty, the next few sketches were uninspired. A nerd's tour of his home was the  show's nadir -- the one sketch where you could really tell the difference  between first-string and second-string work.  </P> <P> Yet the next sketch, about a couple of complainers at a deli, bristled with the  energy of a raucous cartoon; credit writers/performers Corky Omine and Billy  Wright.  </P> <P> Audrey Rapoport followed with a surprisingly subtle examination of an Orange  County Republican activist handling an awkward moment at a lecture, and she and  Mary Scheer were hilarious as two smiling drill team members in a halftime  show. Scheer changed course radically to become a voice-ravaged habitue of the  "Ashtray Inn."  </P> <P> A whodunit sketch that opened the second act was forgettable, but affectionate  portraits of goofily enthusiastic teachers, by Sean Whalen and John Cervenka,  were memorable.  </P> <P> Cathy Shambley directed this "Cirque," including the fairly sharp improvisatory  set at the end.  </P> <P> At 7307 Melrose Ave., Sundays at 7:30 p.m., indefinitely. $9.50; (213)  934-9700.  </P> <P> DON SHIRLEY  </P></p>

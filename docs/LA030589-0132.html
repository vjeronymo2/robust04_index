			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALL ABOARD THE ROCKY MOUNTAIN TRAIN IN CANADA  </P> <P> It was early afternoon when engineer Don Angus steadily eased the throttle on  the 3,000-horsepower diesel electric locomotive along the main line at  mile-marker 114 out of Vancouver.  </P> <P> Passengers aboard the train crowded the open vestibules, cameras poised, while  those inside lined up before the large picture windows.  </P> <P> Twenty yards away appeared Pyramid Falls, cascading majestically down Canada's  Mt. Cheadle. We heard the roar of water and caught the scent of pine.  </P> <P> This was just one of the attractions along the Monashee Mountains area of the  Canadian Rockies between the towns of Kamloops in British Columbia and Jasper  in Alberta Province.  </P> <P> Few railroads accommodate passengers as does the Rocky Mountain Daylight Train.  Organized last year, the run will be repeated again from spring until early  autumn by Via Rail Canada, the Canadian counterpart to America's Amtrak  railroad system.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Maximum Sightseeing  </P> <P> On June 4, and continuing every Sunday morning through Oct. 15, the train will  leave the Canadian Northern Railroad Station in Vancouver, British Columba, at  9 a.m. and head east.  </P> <P> For two days it will move along a route on a schedule designed to provide the  maximum sightseeing opportunities through some of the most spectacular mountain  scenery on the North American continent. And passengers won't miss attractions  at night, as the train stops every evening.  </P> <P> Until last year, passengers got only bits of the Canadian Rockies as they  traveled aboard another trans-Canadian train that operates between Vancouver  and Montreal.  </P> <P> Because of complaints from passengers over missing much of the scenery, the new  train was placed in service.  </P> <P> From Vancouver, after an all-day run, it arrives at the little town of Kamloops  where passengers overnight. The next morning the train is split into two  sections.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Retracing Their Runs  </P> <P> One group of four cars heads for the resort town of Jasper in the heart of  Jasper National Park, the other six continue to Banff National Park.  </P> <P> On Thursday morning both trains retrace their runs back to Kamloops for another  overnight and a return to Vancouver. Travelers have the option of going one way  or round trip. Overnight accommodations at Kamloops are included in the price  (this year about $230 one way or $400 round trip).  </P> <P> One-way passengers to Jasper have a variety of transportation choices for any  additional excursions: They may rent a car, take a motor coach or go by train  from Jasper to Banff, and then travel to Calgary. Banff/Calgary vacationers can  continue to Jasper.  </P> <P> Assigned to each car on the train is a service attendant who serves meals,  complimentary soft drinks, tea and coffee and provides detailed information  about sights along the route.  </P> <P> On a typical eastbound Rocky Mountain by Daylight run, each car can take 35 to  55 passengers.  </P> <P> Because the train has no dining car, meals and refreshments are served to  passengers at seats.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Changing Panorama  </P> <P> Of more importance is the constantly changing panorama unfolding outside the  coach windows. As the train moves through the wilderness it passes small  settlements and sawmills. Fishermen wave from rivers and lakes and rafters  sweep through rapids.  </P> <P> After leaving Vancouver there are the flatlands of the Fraser Delta as well as  the 850-mile Fraser River that was the primary transportation route for  trappers, hunters and gold seekers in western Canada's early days.  </P> <P> At the end of this trip passengers arrive at Moose Lake, headwaters of that  same mighty river.  </P> <P> To the east loom a stately parade of peaks -- Hope, Ogilvie, Squeah and Spider  -- and to the west rises Mt. Baird, The Old Settler and Mt. Urguhart.  </P> <P> Later the train moves past Hell's Gate, where the waters of the Fraser churn in  white fury.  </P> <P> Ahead are more miles of scenery: mountain peaks, glaciers and tumbling  waterfalls.  </P></p>

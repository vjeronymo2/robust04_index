			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 28 (KNS-KCNA) [dateline as received] --  Officials of the General Association of Korean Residents in  Japan (Chongnyon) and other organizations and Korean residents  in Japan are lifting up louder voices of protest against the  Japanese authorities openly cracking down on Chongnyon,  clamouring about fictitious "nuclear suspicion of the North".    Kim Chong-mun, chairman of the Higashinari branch of the  Osaka prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon, said that the  Korean compatriots in Japan got angry with the fascist crackdown  on the prefectural headquarters and its branches by the Japanese  police and that they would meet the intolerable challenge of the  reactionaries with a united force and make all efforts to defend  their organizations and the nation.    Kim Ae-min, chairperson of the Higashiyodogawa, Osaka  Prefecture branch of the Democratic Union of Korean Women in  Japan, said that they would further consolidate the  singlehearted unity and counter the suppression by the  reactionaries with a struggle.    Hong Chang-kwang, director of the organization department of  the Taito branch of the Tokyo metropolitan headquarters of  Chongnyon, strongly demanded that Japanese authorities  immediately stop the crackdown on Chongnyon and Korean residents  in Japan, saying that the recent incident is a product of the  national chauvinist policy of the Japanese Government  authorities.    Yi Chu-song, chairman of the Kanto District headquarters of  the union of Korean students studying at Japanese schools,  warned that if the Japanese authorities continued to pursue the  hostile policy against Korea and Korean nation without  repentance of their past colonial domination over Korea, they  would face the strong denunciation of the Korean residents in  Japan and conscientious people of Japan.    Kim Chong-kil, director of the International Department of  the Fukuoka prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon, and Choe  In-chol, vice-chairman of the Tokyo metropolitan headquarters of  the League of Korean Youth in Japan, denounced the forcible  search by the Japanese authorities as total challenge of Japan  to Chongnyon.    On April 27, officials of Chongnyon organizations of  different levels and Korean residents in Japan staged a protest  against the Osaka prefectural police headquarters and the  Higashi police station of Osaka Prefecture.    Branches of the Osaka prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon  held protest meetings.</p>

			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Washington to foot the bill: Number of claims will rise as the waters fall MOST OF the insurance cost resulting from the Mississippi floods will be picked up by the federal government, under the National Flood Insurance Programme and a separate federally-run crop insurance scheme. The Federal Insurance Administration, which runs the National Flood Insurance Programme, said yesterday it could not yet put a figure on the cost of the disaster in insurance terms. By Friday, it had received 41 claims in Illinois, where it has around 3,600 policyholders, about 29 claims in Missouri, where there are more than 7,300 policyholders, and smaller numbers of claims from Wisconsin, Iowa and Minnesota. However, these numbers are expected to increase once the waters have receded and the extent of the damage becomes clearer. The National Flood Insurance Programme, which began life about 25 years ago, is administered by private sector insurers, who pay out claims and are then reimbursed by the federal authorities. Over the past eight years, the programme has been self-funding, according to the American Insurance Association - with premiums collected from policyholders meeting the claims submitted. Both the Federal Insurance Administration and the AIA acknowledge that there may be substantial under-insurance - or non-insurance - in flood-affected areas. The AIA estimates that there are about 10m buildings in the nation's flood plains, and that only about 2.5m are covered by federal insurance. There is virtually no private-sector flood insurance written, although some supplementary coverage is sometimes purchased to top up the federal scheme. As a result, a number of the largest US property-casualty insurers, who suffered multi-billion-dollar losses from Hurricane Andrew in August last year and Hurricane Hugo in 1989, said the Mississippi situation should cause them little problem. 'Much of the flooding situation is covered by federal government, and we're a relatively small player on the commercial side,' said Allstate, the large Chicago-based property-casualty insurer.</p>

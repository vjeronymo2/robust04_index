			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / Arts: Quirks of fate supplement the prize line-up - Cannes Film Festival At my prep school they used to show a feature film on the last night of term. No matter what it was - Citizen Kane or Carry On Up The Khyber - the same air of punch-drunk euphoria reigned. The assembled schoolboys knew that their bags were packed and that there were 12 hours to freedom. It was the same at the end of the 45th Cannes Film Festival. We had written our final exam papers and attended every competition sitting; soon we would hear about the prizes. Now all we had to do was to watch Tom Cruise in the non-competitive closing movie Far And Away. This exuberant load of tosh, the first film shot in 65-millimetre since Ryan's Daughter, has Cruise as a young Irish peasant who streetfights his way from Connemara to Oklahoma, via Boston, in the 1890s while falling in love with Nicole Kidman (aka Cruise's offscreen girlfriend). The Cannes audience loved the film. They cheered when Cruise first kisses Kidman in front of a snow-patterned window with tinkly Christmas harp music from John (ET) Williams. They cheered the climactic Oklahoma land race and ensuing punch-up between hero and villain for Miss Kidman's hand. Most of all they cheered the fact that Cannes had nothing left to throw at them. Now more than ever was it rich to leave. The final days brought some piquant addenda, but they were provided less by Hollywood than by North America's shoestring divisions. The expected mega-treats disappointed. David Lynch's Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me is a catchpenny prequel to the TV series; Sidney Lumet's A Stranger Among Us is a daft cop thriller with Melanie Griffith going undercover among New York's Hasidic Jews, and Gary Sinise's Of Mice And Men is a Steinbeck adaptation notable only for John Malkovich's touching Lenny. I enjoyed far more two lesser-budget films drawn from their makers' own lives. In the Directors Fortnight actor John Turturro presented his writing-directing debut Mac. This low-budget tale of a self-made Italian-American housebuilder (Turturro) and his battle for honest values in a corrupt world is a touch loudhailed: like an Arthur Miller script directed by Federico Fellini. But at best it is also powerfully funny, with Turturro a marvel in the lead role based on his own father. From Canada came Jean-Claude Lauzon's Leolo. The 12-year-old hero is the film-maker himself, growing up in a ramshackle family flat in 1960s Montreal where puberty, poverty and an army of potty relatives surge around him. Especially eye-catching are Grandpa, who is dispatched to a mental asylum during the brief intervals when Leolo is not trying to kill him, and musclebound Big Brother who trains himself to look like A. Schwarzenegger but still gets sand kicked in his face by any passer-by. Like Mac the film is loud, episodic and all' Italiana. It is also witty, infectious and winningly candid about sexual self-discovery. The last days of Cannes are devoted in part to catching up with missed films that colleagues tell you are masterpieces. This is never a gratifying pastime. Either the colleague is right, in which case you are late with the scoop. Or the colleague is wrong, in which case you want to brain him. Braining has been a la mode at Cannes in 1992. Top of the films I could have spent my life without seeing is Victor Erice's The Sun In The Quince Tree, even though it shared the Prix du Jury and won the International Critics Prize. This 2 1/2 -hour Spanish docudrama about a painter painting, yes, a sunlit quince tree manages the remarkable feat of seeming both artless and pretentious. In a grainy mixture of film and video, it drones on trying to achieve its quasi-religious minimalism. But we never feel cinematically the sensual magic of the artistic process, proclaimed in words by the real-life painter Antonio Lopez. Nor do we know why there are so many extracurricular shots of railway lines or TV sets glowing in night apartments or Mrs Lopez pottering around the house. So we come to the 45th Cannes Film Festival prizes. Jury president Gerard Depardieu walked onto the stage, with that hunched-shouldered rolling gait we know from a hundred French movies, like a bear searching for honey. And soon we knew which honey-pot he was going for. The Palme d'Or winner was Bille August's Best Intentions, praised on this page last week and cheered again at Cannes last night. The majestic Ingmar Bergman-scripted period epic, based on the lives of Ingmar's own parents, also won Best Actress for Pernilla August, the director's wife, who played Bergman's mother. If you can cope with that dynastic tangle, how about the evening's other coincidences and convolutions? America's The Player, as well as winning Best Director for Robert Altman, won Best Actor for Tim Robbins, seen here most recently squiring his first film as director - the amiable political satire Bob Roberts - through the festival. And John Turturro, last year's Cannes Best Actor for Barton Fink, also brought his directing debut to Cannes, the aforementioned Mac, and ran off with the prestigious Camera d'Or award for Best First Feature. One other Cannes quirk of fate. Bille August was the first non-American to win the Palme d'Or for four years. The last non-American to win the prize was - Bille August. That was for Pelle The Conqueror in 1988. What a tangled web the film festival world weaves. This writer is now awarding himself a personal Palme d'Or for getting through it all - the confusions, coincidences and critical rigours - and is departing into well-fed anonymity in central France.</p>

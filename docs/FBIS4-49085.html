			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, May 1 (XINHUA) -- A group of Hong Kong  residents arrived here tonight after a two-day visit to the  barracks of a People's Liberation Army (PLA) unit in the Chinese  mainland.    The visit was the first of its kind ever arranged for Hong  Kong compatriots.    During their stay in Guangzhou, capital of south China's  Guangdong Province, the delegation paid a visit to the  headquarters of the Guangzhou Military Region, where they were  warmly received by the region's top officers.    The 200-member-strong delegation, which mainly comprised  public figures from various circles of Hong Kong, toured the  barracks and watched a military performance in the northeastern  suburbs of Guangzhou City. The well-trained soldiers of the  PLA and their skills and colorful life in the barracks have  deeply impressed the delegation. Many of the visitors believed  that such tours could promote the communication and  understanding between the PLA in the Chinese mainland and people  in Hong Kong.</p>

			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> QUAYLE BACKS JAPAN TIES  </P> <P> Vice President Dan Quayle, who toured two northern Japan military bases on the  third day of his Far East visit, said that the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty must  not be touched. "Anybody who thinks you ought to tamper, rewrite or modify the  U.S.-Japan Security Treaty is wrong," Quayle told reporters during a flight to  Chitose and Misawa, the two main air bases guarding northern Japan. Japan's  opposition Socialist Party has called for scaling back U.S.-Japan military  ties. In the Philippines, the May One Movement, a 750,000-member labor group,  accused the United States of attempting to pressure Manila to extend the lease  on key U.S. military bases and vowed protests during Quayle's visit, which  begins Tuesday.  </P></p>

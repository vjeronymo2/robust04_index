			<p>CSO     [Text] Tokyo Gas Company has developed a co-generation  system that saves space and realizes low costs by directly  inputting waste heat into the heat exchanger. Previous  co-generation systems used waste heat to produce cold water for  air coolers by employing a hot-water-powered absorption  refrigerator, but in small-scale operations the temperature of  the waste heat was so low that efficiency was poor for such a  large piece of equipment. This new system not only takes up  30%  less space than previous equipment from Tokyo Gas, but also  costs about 10% less. Tokyo Gas will install the new  system at  its Energy Technology Research Institute in Minato-ku, Tokyo,  and begin demonstration testing by August.    In previous co-generation systems a hot-water-powered  absorption refrigerator that used waste heat emerging from gas  turbines and gas engines at 80-90C was combined with a  gas-powered absorption water-cooler in a two-tiered system for  generating cool air. In the new system, the waste heat is  recovered by the heat exchanger directly and inserted into the  gas-powered absorption water-cooler cycle. The hot water in this  cycle heats the refrigerant and produces cool air through the  action of evaporation. Tokyo Gas says it was possible to improve  the performance of the heat exchanger, and thus enable direct  connection with the cooling water.    Because the new heat exchanger is much smaller than the  hot-water-powered absorption refrigerator, it is possible to  make the whole system more compact. Normally, co-generation  plants are installed in areas with limited space such as  basements and rooftops, so making the unit more compact offers  considerable advantages.    In terms of cost, the new system offers almost no change in  operating costs such as gas consumption, but the cost of the  unit itself will be about 10% lower than before. Because  the  system has been simplified, maintenance costs are also expected  to be lower. As far as the old systems are concerned, for a  plant on the scale of 100 tons refrigeration, an additional  investment of about &yen;1 million to add the new heat exchanger  will allow the hot-water-powered absorption refrigerator to be  eliminated, just like in the new systems.    Tokyo Gas has replaced the 50 tons refrigeration-class  co-generation system at its Technology Research Institute with  the new type, continued performance testing, and confirmed its  stability. Therefore, Tokyo Gas plans to install a large  demonstration system and attempt to bring performance to an even  higher level. The system is expected to appear on the general  market next spring.</p>

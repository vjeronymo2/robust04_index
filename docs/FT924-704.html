			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Albrighton pays Pounds 3.2m for Tarmac quarry arm ALBRIGHTON, which over the past two years has made a series of disposals to reduce indebtedness, yesterday announced an expansion of the group's chosen field of operations - quarrying  - with the acquisition of the natural stone products side of Tarmac Buildings Materials for Pounds 3.21m cash. The sale by Tarmac takes the proceeds from its own disposal programme to Pounds 130m for the year. Mr Peter Woodman, Albrighton chairman and chief executive, said that the natural dimensional stone industry in the UK had enjoyed a revival in the past decade and that growth was expected to continue. To pay for the acquisition, comprising five dimensional sandstone quarries in Derbyshire and the north of England and two masonry processing plants, Albrighton is to issue, by way of an open offer and placing, some 44.3m new ordinary shares, at 12p each and on a 7-for-1 basis, to raise about Pounds 4.96m net. In the six months to September 30, Albrighton reduced its pre-tax losses to Pounds 62,000 (Pounds 347,000) on turnover down at Pounds 1.16m (Pounds 6.85m).</p>

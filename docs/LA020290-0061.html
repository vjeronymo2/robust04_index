			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BULGARIA'S PREMIER, COMMUNIST-CONTROLLED CABINET RESIGN  </P> <P> Prime Minister Georgi Atanassov, a holdover from the era of disgraced leader  Todor Zhivkov, resigned along with his 22-member Communist-controlled Cabinet,  Bulgarian state radio said late Thursday.  </P> <P> The resignation was the first by a government since 1947, when the Communist  Party consolidated power in postwar Bulgaria, according to the state news  agency BTA.  </P> <P> The Cabinet's departure clears the way for creation of an interim government to  run Bulgaria until elections this year. The Communists have proposed such a  government to share power with the opposition.  </P> <P> The state news agency said the resignations became known Thursday night during  an emergency, closed-door Communist Party congress. The government will  continue to serve until Parliament accepts its resignation, the agency said. No  date was given.  </P> <P> Delegates to the party congress remained in session and were expected to  continue meeting through this morning.  </P> <P> Earlier Thursday, the delegates adopted a new party platform that confirmed the  relinquishing of the Communists' monopoly on power, as approved by Parliament  last month. They also sanctioned moderate reforms before starting the secret  session to elect the party leadership.  </P> <P> Atanassov had come under fire for failing to curb unprecedented labor unrest  and resolve other economic ills. His resignation was widely expected.  </P> <P> Atanassov became prime minister in March, 1986. He survived the Nov. 10 ouster  of Communist Party chief Zhivkov, but was not able to escape the former  leader's shadow. Zhivkov is now under arrest on criminal charges.  </P></p>

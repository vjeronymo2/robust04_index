			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Sergey Filonenko: "Vladivostok Becomes a </F> Battlefield"]    [Text] Large-scale operations to combat organized  crime will commence in Vladivostok in the first days of  June.    This was stated at a news conference last Friday by Vladimir  Ipatov, chief of the kray's Internal Affairs Administration.  Additional forces of the militia will be pulled in from other  cities and rayons of the kray. It is planned in the very near  future to organize inspections of the gang "haunts" and secret  addresses and the motor transport and papers of all suspects,  which will last for several months.    So concentrated an assault on the city's crime is connected  with the events that occurred at the end of last week and the  start of this, when several militia officers were killed and  wounded. In retaliation, 145 persons were detained and eight  guns and seven radios were confiscated in literally a matter of  days. The militia officers arrested 45 persons at a gathering of  crime groupings, at which narcotics, weapons, $55,000, and  approximately R50 million were confiscated.</p>

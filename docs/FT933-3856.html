			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Grassroots Tory activists signal discontent DISCONTENT AMONG Tory grassroots activists at the government's policies on value added tax, defence cuts and law and order has been pressed home to the party leadership in the motions presented for the annual conference. The 1,200 motions submitted by constituency parties, published yesterday, reveal deep concern about the impact of the Budget decision to impose VAT on domestic fuel. Almost 150 of the motions concern the economy, and one in five of these either calls for the reversal of the VAT extension or expresses reservations about it. The motion from Wirral West - the constituency of Mr David Hunt, employment secretary - was among the most outspoken, saying that the move was 'totally incompatible' with the principles of fairness laid out in the Citizen's Charter. Sir Norman Fowler, party chairman, appeared to draw comfort from the fact that many of the motions on the economy called for action to be taken to reduce the PSBR. But the range of opinions expressed, from calls for an income tax increase to vigorous opposition to such a move, is a further reminder of the rift in the party over tackling government borrowing. There is a striking degree of consensus, however, among the motions on defence, almost all of which demand a reversal of the reductions in defence spending or a halt to further cuts. There was a call for caution over the impact of cutting the armed services, including one from the Edinburgh Pentlands constituency of Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary. Although more coded in its terms than others, it urges that any restructuring of the services should allow them to meet current and possible future commitments. The largest number of motions on a single topic is the 244 on law and order, which the government has already said will be one of its main themes in the coming months. Only about a dozen, uncontroversial motions will be selected for debate at the conference in early October. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said last night: 'The Conservative motions demonstrate that the party is now divided from top to bottom over the imposition of VAT on fuel bills after Labour's successful campaign opposing it. 'The prime minister should now overrule the Chancellor and order a rethink of VAT on fuel.'</p>

			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE 100 fails to hold on to early gains - Market Report The London equity market market launched another determined attack on the 3,200 level on the FT-SE 100 index. But, as with previous recent attempts, it was rebuffed and the index finished the session weaker after suffering a sharp decline in mid-afternoon. At the close the FT-SE index was 20.1 lower at 3,171.3, while the FT-SE Mid 250 index, bolstered by another strong performance by many utility stocks, ended 4.1 off at 3,749.8. Once again it was a sharp sell-off in international bonds that triggered a reversal in equities, although there were plenty of reasons for taking short-term profits in UK equities, dealers said. They also pointed out that the UK equity market had outperformed its European counterparts for much of the day reflecting sizeable switching across the Continent. London was badly affected by a steep upward revision of Gross Domestic Product for the second quarter which revived worries in London that the economy may need to be restrained in order to choke off inflationary pressures. Earlier, the trading session begun with the equity market in good form. Marketmakers hoisted prices at the outset, with the FT-SE 100 almost seven points ahead at the opening and looking to go better as gilt-edged stocks made progress. However, the GDP figure and a sudden sharp fall in German bunds caught the market on the hop, and a near 10-point rise around 9.00am was transformed into a near-10 point fall within an hour. The next downward lurch occurred as Wall Street opened sharply lower and 16 points down, before staging a moderate rally. The FT-SE 100 hit the day's low point of 3,164.7, down 26.7, shortly after US markets opened but then stabilised as cheap buyers emerged. Senior dealers expressed no real surprise at the market's decline, pointing to the relatively low level of activity in London where turnover came out at 499.1m shares, well down on recent levels. Non-FT-SE stocks accounted for almost 62 per cent of turnover in equities. Customer business was also said to have suffered yesterday and was expected to come in lower than last Friday's 1.27bn figure. Market strategists were uneasy over the GDP numbers. One said that although economic growth was strong there were definite signs that inflationary pressures were increasing. 'The details mean that second quarter profits will be better than the market is currently looking for and could also mean there will be a shift out of bonds, where the market will fret about inflation, and into equities, ' said one market observer. A senior trader at one of the UK integrated securities houses said that while the London market felt okay at current levels and that there had been no real selling pressure, he was concerned at the absence of support from London institutions when the big European markets fell away. The banking sector provided the FT-SE 100's best individual performer in NatWest where analysts were predicting a strong chart break-out and forecasting a short term level of 510p. NatWest's potential outperformance would come at the expense of Barclays and HSBC, it was said. Utilities were again heavily traded with Smith New Court said to have been recommending a switch from selective electricity stocks into water shares. Nikko, the Japanese-owned stockbroker said it was hard to see what was going to inspire the market in the short term, with no important economic data this week to inspire or deter the market. The broker did point out, however, that the market has been boosted of late by bid rumours and that a cash bid in the FT-SE 100 would provide the momentum for the FT-SE to break through the 3,200 level.</p>

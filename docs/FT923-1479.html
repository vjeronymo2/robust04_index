			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Atomic body moves into profit formerly the UK Atomic Energy Authority - made a net profit of Pounds 16.8m in the year to 31 March, its first surplus since 1987. Last year it lost Pounds 40m net. The 1991-92 results, announced yesterday, show that state-owned AEA is expanding its sales of non-nuclear industrial technology rapidly to make up for the decline in government-funded nuclear research. Total turnover has been steady for the past five years at about Pounds 440m a year, while the industrial division's sales rose from Pounds 85m in 1990-91 to Pounds 105m in 1991-92.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report from the "With the Events" program] </F>   [Text] An economic delegation led by the governor of the  U.S. state of Massachusetts met with several Palestinian figures  today to discuss with the possibility of extending economic  assistance to the residents of the territories. Our  correspondent Sa'id Mu'addi has compiled the following report on  the issue:    [Begin recording] [Mu'addi] The U.S. economic delegation  headed by Massachusetts Governor William Weld met with Faysal  al-Husayni, economist Dr. Samir 'Abdallah, and Dr. Hazim  al-Shunnar in east Jerusalem at noon today. The talks addressed  economic issues, the means of developing the territories  economically, and possible financial investment by U.S. firms in  the West Bank and Gaza Strip. This delegation is made up of  representatives from 22 U.S. firms in various areas.    At the conclusion of the meeting, Weld said that his visit  is  aimed at exploring investment opportunities in the region,  particularly in the areas of tourism, financial investment,  infrastructure development, and construction projects, such as  hotels, communications facilities, and modern technologies. The  delegation is comprised of representatives from 22 firms, he  added. Weld noted that these firms are interested in developing  the territories economically.    [Weld, in English] We are looking for opportunities in  areas,  such as tourism, such as financial investments, possibly  construction, either of infrastructure or hotels,  telecommunications, and information technology.    [Mu'addi] During the meeting, no agreements were signed  between the two sides. Weld said he hoped that the U.S. firms  will be able to make financial investments in the West Bank and  Gaza Strip.    [Weld, in English] We didn't sign any agreement in there.  But we are hopeful that we will be able to participate in  investments in the area, in the territories, in the West Bank  and Gaza.    [Mu'addi] During the meeting, both sides exchanged views on  current issues, particularly the peace process.    [Al-Husayni] As the governor has just said, this session of  talks addressed political issues. Several questions and  inquiries have been made about economic issues. Consequently,  the talks were couched in generalities. I believe that it was  positive. The delegation demonstrated a good understanding of  the situation in the territories.    [Mu'addi] Has the issue of investment in the West Bank and  Gaza Strip from Massachusetts been raised?    [Al-Husayni] Such details have not been discussed. I believe  that such issues can be discussed in subsequent talks with  businessmen and firms.    [Mu'addi] Since you have recently returned from a visit to  Saudi Arabia, could you tell us about the outcome of your visit?    [Al-Husayni] I believe that the outcome is good and  positive.  Undoubtedly, it has helped improve and enhance the ties between  Saudi Arabia and the PLO. We hope that the visit by brother  President Yasir 'Arafat to Saudi Arabia will consummate the  outcome reached during my visit.    [Mu'addi] What about Saudi aid to citizens in the West Bank  and Gaza Strip?    [Al-Husayni] As a matter of fact, Saudi Arabia has always  been concerned for aiding the Palestinians. I believe that now  an opportunity has been created for greater and firmer support  in light of the current developments we are experiencing,  particularly with regard to Jerusalem.    [Mu'addi] Faysal al-Husayni said he hoped that an agreement  between the Israelis and Palestinians will be reached, and that  both sides will embark on the implementation of the joint  Declaration of Principles in the Gaza-Jericho First accord.    [Al-Husayni] We hope that these talks will come to a  successful conclusion so that we may embark on the  implementation of the provisions pertaining to the interim  phase, and so that we may have the opportunity to begin talks on  the final status.

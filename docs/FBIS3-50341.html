			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Belgrade, 27 Jan (TANJUG) -- Yugoslavia and  Hungary agree that both sides should prepare for the period  after the sanctions have been lifted in order to be ready  immediately to expand their cooperation in all fields within the  scope of their realistic potentials. This was said in Belgrade  this evening during the first round of Yugoslav-Hungarian talks  at foreign ministerial level. [passage omitted]    This evening [Hungarian Foreign Minister] Geza Jeszenszky  briefed his hosts about the essence of Hungary's foreign policy  and its European orientation. In this orientation, Jeszenszky  said, priority is given to Hungary's relations with its  neighbors, which, he was told, coincides with the Yugoslav  orientation.    The Hungarian guest was told that the FRY is also  Europe-oriented, that our country is very close to being  admitted to the Council of Europe and other important European  institutions, but is kept away from the European processes of  integration with the outbreak of the Yugoslav crisis.    Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladimir Jovanovic informed his  Hungarian counterpart and his associates about the present  moment in the Yugoslav crisis, particularly about the war in  Bosnia. He said that Yugoslavia made a great contribution to  the establishment of a just peace in that former Yugoslav  republic and that, unfortunately one side (Muslims) is not ready  to accept a solution which the other two warring sides have  accepted. Despite this the FRY will continue to invest efforts  to stop the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina and to have the sanctions  lifted.    Vladislav Jovanovic spoke at length about the sanctions  against the FRY. He underscored that their maintenance leads to  the escalation of the war in Bosnia and the destabilization of  the Balkans. Besides, the Yugoslav foreign minister said, the  sanctions are not only affecting the FRY but many other  countries as well, especially neighboring ones.    In view of this, the Yugoslav side said, the FRY expects  neighboring countries to more resolutely oppose the extension of  the sanctions and hopes that Hungary will make an effort to have  them lifted as soon as possible.    Opinions were also exchanged this evening on the activities  of the CSCE. In this context, the talks centered on Hungary's  role as a member of the so-called CSCE troika -- the former, the  current, and the future chairing country -- as well as its role  as that institution's chairing country next year.    The Yugoslav side expressed its readiness and wish to have  Yugoslavia readmitted to the CSCE as a full-fledged member.  However, it was stressed, such a decision should be made by  those who had frozen Yugoslavia's membership and the FRY's  readmittance should be dignified and without preconditions.  [passage omitted]    Geza Jeszenszky was told this evening that Belgrade  appreciates what Hungary has been doing so far in its relations  with the FRY. Hungary is one of the few countries that refused  to introduce visas for Yugoslav passport holders since the  outbreak of the crisis, while other countries had done so for  less justified reasons. Consequently, it is in Yugoslavia's  interest to improve its ties with Hungary and to gradually  promote cooperation in all areas relevant to the two countries'  needs and potentials, Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky  was told in Belgrade this evening.</p>

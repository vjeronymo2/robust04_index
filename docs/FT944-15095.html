			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / China slows reforms in fight to check inflation China is for the moment slowing the pace of economic reform while it seeks to bring inflation under control and head off possible social unrest, Chinese officials told a meeting of the World Economic Forum yesterday. Senior Chinese officials, including Mr Wang Zhongyu, minister of the State Economic and Trade Commission, indicated that a need for stability was preoccupying the leadership, which he said had made the anti-inflation fight its most important priority for the rest of the year. A World Economic Forum official said after the two-day session organised by the Swiss-based consultative group and attended by government and business leaders that his impression was that the Chinese had entered a 'period of pause. For the moment, what concerns them is taming inflation. They feel they need a period of slower growth rather than starting a new phase of reform.' China's State Statistical Bureau announced on Tuesday that the cost of living nationwide was 27.4 per cent higher in September than the same month last year. Economic growth for the past two years has averaged over 13 per cent. Growth of 11-12 per cent is forecast this year. Beijing introduced price controls last month on staple foodstuffs in an effort to break the inflationary cycle. Food prices have risen sharply in the past year. The World Economic Forum official noted that reformist impulses in Beijing had been subdued in comparison with last year, when Chinese officials were discussing ambitious plans for reform of the banking system and state enterprises. 'Now,' the official said, 'there is a mood of consolidation and caution.' Officials had deflected questions about plans to force state enterprises into bankruptcy under a pilot programme announced earlier this year and meant to target some 100 faltering enterprises in 18 cities. The authorities have been reluctant to bankrupt enterprises because of fears of social unrest among laid-off employees. Government economists estimate that of the 11,000 large and medium state enterprises, about one-third are in the red. Another one-third barely break even. The State Statistical Bureau says that in the first nine months of this year, some 44.5 per cent of state enterprises have made losses. State-owned enterprises have been hard hit in an austerity programme begun last year and aimed at calming the economy. Many enterprises are starved of working capital and some have problems paying employees.</p>

			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: Cedel seeks approval to apply for banking licence Cedel, the international clearing and settlement organisation, is urging the nearly 100 banks who own it to allow it to apply for a Luxembourg banking licence in order to compete head-on with Morgan Guaranty's Euroclear system. The move has been prompted by the Basle agreement on international bank capital adequacy rules, which require deposits against unsettled trades held at a corporation such as Cedel to carry a 100 per cent risk weighting. However, settlement deposits at Euroclear, which has a banking licence through Morgan Guaranty, carry a 20 per cent risk capital weighting, making it much cheaper to use for international securities clearing and settlement. Until now, Cedel has been reluctant to apply for a banking licence, partly out of concern at some of its shareholders that it could become their competitor.</p>

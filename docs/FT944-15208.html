			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / International Company News: Intel posts record earnings for term Intel, the world's largest semiconductor manufacturer, reported record sales and earnings for the third quarter, with revenues up sharply as sales of its high-performance Pentium microprocessors, used in the latest personal computers, doubled. Revenues for the quarter were Dollars 2.86bn, up from Dollars 2.24bn a year ago. Net income rose 14 per cent to Dollars 659m, or Dollars 1.52 a share, against Dollars 584m, or Dollars 1.33, for the same quarter last year. 'The PC industry is rapidly moving to a new performance standard, based on Pentium microprocessors,' said Mr Andrew Grove, president and chief executive. 'The PC industry is moulting, shedding its past in a way that hasn't happened for a decade. Just one year ago, the standard was a PC featuring an Intel 486 microprocessor. Today, a PC at the same price point has a Pentium processor.' Intel said it expected to meet its goal of increasing Pentium sales to 25 per cent of its fourth-quarter microprocessor unit sales. A second goal was to ship 6m-7m Pentium chips this year. The company said it expected to be within a few weeks of meeting this goal by the end of the year. Although Intel dominates the market for microprocessors used in PCs, with about 90 per cent of the world market, there are strong competitors. Advanced Micro Devices is expected this week to announce a new chip called the 'K86', which it says will be compatible with Intel's Pentium, but faster. IBM, Nexgen and Cyrix are also offering their own versions of Intel-compatible microprocessors. The threat of a new PC standard that could undermine Intel's domination of the market appears, however, to be receding. Efforts by IBM, Motorola and Apple to establish their jointly-developed 'PowerPC' microprocessor as an alternative standard for PCs have so far had little impact, largely because there is limited software available for PCs built with the new microprocessor. Intel's nine-month revenues were Dollars 8.29bn, up 30 per cent from Dollars 6.39bn. Net income was Dollars 1.92bn, up 13 per cent from Dollars 1.7bn for the first three quarters of 1993. Earnings per share grew to Dollars 4.37 from Dollars 3.86. See Lex</p>

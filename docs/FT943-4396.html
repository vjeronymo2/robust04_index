			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Raids in Japan expose misuse of aid programme - Some projects to help the poor really have commercial motives The National Maritime Polytechnic in the Philippines, built with Japanese overseas development aid, is equipped to train 700 seamen but to date few have occupied its halls. A children's hospital in Pakistan had to leave sophisticated medical equipment, purchased with aid from Japan, lying idle because no one could handle the machinery. Japan's overseas development aid, which at Dollars 11.3bn is the largest in the world, has recently been widely criticised as commercially motivated and ineffective. The raid this week by Japan's Fair Trade Commission on more than 40 companies seemed to confirm what many in Japan had long suspected: that ODA money was being shared by Japanese companies for projects that served their interests more than those of the recipients. The companies, which include some of Japan's largest trading houses such as Mitsubishi and Marubeni, are suspected of forming cartels to pre-determine which companies would win orders for certain ODA projects. While the raid in itself came as a surprise to the Japanese public, the possibility that such bid-rigging involving ODA projects had been going on, did not. In 1986, two employees of the Japan International Co-operation Agency (JICA), which is responsible for implementing Japan's aid programmes, were found guilty of accepting bribes from companies keen to win aid projects. Japanese companies have also been suspected of engaging in illicit deals with the government of Ferdinand Marcos, former president of the Philippines. Japan's aid programme has frequently been criticised for its lack of transparency from the decision-making process to implementation. 'The aid policy is determined by bureaucrats but the implementation is in fact left up to companies,' contends Mr Yoshinori Murai, professor at the Institute of Asian Cultures at Sophia University in Tokyo and co-ordinator of the ODA Research and Study Group, a non-governmental organisation. The accusation applies to less than 20 per cent of Japan's ODA involving grants and technical co-operation aid which is tied, meaning that only Japanese companies can win contracts for building the hospitals, training centres and schools and supplying them with equipment. The remaining 80 per cent of Japan's ODA is untied and last year only 35 per cent of contracts were awarded to Japanese companies. The latest suspicion of cartel activity is thought to involve, in particular, technical co-operation assistance which, in addition to being tied, is awarded through a designated bidding system. Contracts are not awarded through competitive bidding but are restricted to companies which have registered with JICA. Furthermore, many of the projects carried out with technical co-operation aid are thought to be recommended to recipient governments by Japanese companies themselves. Critics say the need for companies which have invested resources in coming up with aid projects to ensure that they win the relevant contracts encourages cartel activity and the designated bidding system facilitates such practices. Foreign ministry officials admit the system has its flaws. 'Many weak governments of developing countries do not have the ability to draw up their own projects and JICA employees do not have the expertise to judge the costs of projects and facilities,' says one foreign affairs official. Foreign ministry officials also concede that many ODA projects fail for lack of follow-up activity, but insist recipient countries must eventually look after facilities for themselves. 'We provide technical experts to help train local staff but we cannot go on doing so forever. Japan's ODA policy is to encourage self-help,' says one. The foreign ministry, stung by the latest allegations, has asked JICA to consider whether the system needs to be reviewed. In line with a growing trend for greater transparency in Japan's bidding system, JICA should consider providing more information on bids, Mr Murai says. But anything beyond that, such as an ODA basic law, is likely to be resisted by the bureaucrats who have their own vested interests to consider, he says.</p>

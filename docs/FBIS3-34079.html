In a meeting with Deputy Majlis Speaker, Hojjat ol-Eslam Dr.  Hasan Rowhani, he criticized international forums for keeping  silent towards the five year-old Armenian aggression against the  republic and accused them of adopting impractical measures.    He described Iran's Majlis as a "democratic, free and  independent parliament" and said Azerbaijan could well benefit  from Iran's experiences in the legislative field.    He appreciated Iran's assistance to the peoples of  Azerbaijan  and Nakhichevan and hoped for expansion of mutual relations in  all areas.    Rowhani said that Iran condemns any aggression against the  Azerbaijan Republic and believes that any change of borders will  put regional security and stability in jeopardy.    Iran believes that military confrontations cannot bring any  permanent settlement to the Karabakh conflict and that the  dispute should be resolved through political and peaceful means,  he added.    Rowhani stressed that Iran and Azerbaijan should promote  bilateral cooperation especially in the economic, parliamentary,  scientific and cultural fields.    He also expressed Iran's readiness to participate in  economic  projects in Azerbaijan especially in agriculture, industry, oil  and joint operation in the Caspian Sea.</p>

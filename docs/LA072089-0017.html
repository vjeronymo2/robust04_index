			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WESTERN WALK OPTS FOR A NEW NAME INSTEAD OF A SHOWDOWN  </P> <P> Responding to warnings that they should tread lightly on the legendary and  star-lined Hollywood Walk of Fame, backers of the Newhall Western Walk of Fame  have agreed to change the name of their sidewalk tribute.  </P> <P> From now on, the walkway along San Fernando Road will be known as the Newhall  Walk of Western Stars, said Bob Martin, who heads the committee that maintains  the landmark for the Downtown Newhall Merchants Assn.  </P> <P> The association agreed to change the name after two years of prodding by the  Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, which has copyrighted not only "Hollywood Walk  of Fame" but "Walk of Fame" as well.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sore Spot  </P> <P> The name of the Newhall walkway has "kind of been a sore spot for them for a  couple of years," Martin said.  </P> <P> It's doubtful that anyone could confuse the two tourist attractions. The  Hollywood Walk of Fame, now 29 years old, had 1,895 stars at last count.  </P> <P> The 8-year-old Newhall walkway -- bronze plaques embedded in concrete -- honors  25 Western celebrities from the famous, such as Gene Autry, to the less  well-known, such as stunt man Andy Jauregui.  </P> <P> Martin said the Newhall walkway was started to celebrate Newhall's Western  heritage. The former frontier town, now a part of Santa Clarita, was a backdrop  for many early Westerns.  </P> <P> Ed Lewis, who oversees the marketing of the Hollywood Chamber's landmark, said  the Chamber has never filed a lawsuit to protect its trademark but has  persuaded some organizations to not use the phrase "walk of fame" in the past.  But this is the first time a group has agreed to change the name of an already  established walk of fame, he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Concrete Slab  </P> <P> Still unresolved, however, is the fate of a large concrete slab that announces  the Newhall Western Walk of Fame to motorists along San Fernando Road. "They  have got to change it," said Larry Kaplan, president of the Hollywood Chamber.  </P> <P> But Martin said it's unclear who will pay for a new sign. The marker was  installed by Los Angeles County and now belongs to the city of Santa Clarita.  The two business groups are negotiating the matter. Asked if the Hollywood  Chamber might pay for a new sign itself, Kaplan said, "Our attorney is talking  to their attorney."  </P></p>

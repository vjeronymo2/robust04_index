			<p><P> August 21, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LITTLE LEAGUE WORLD SERIES;  </P> <P> JUST BEING THERE IS A THRILL FOR CYPRESS  </P> <P> Players from the Federal Little League in Cypress were the last to arrive here  Sunday evening for the 44th Little League World Series, but they were enjoying  the early part of their weeklong stay.  </P> <P> "I told the kids, 'Take a look around, you'll never see it again. Ever,' "  Cypress Manager Gary Shelton said. "I'm thrilled. You turn around and see  35,000 people out there on a Saturday and if you aren't tickled like I am,  you're not human. This is my dream.  </P> <P> "Ron (Cypress assistant coach Ron MacDonald) and I got off the buses Sunday and  just went wild. The kids, they ran down here (Lamade Stadium, where all Series  games are played). Before we could stop them, they were already walking around  the field. This is beautiful."  </P> <P> Players from all eight Series teams were given physicals early Monday, then  participated in workouts during a light afternoon rain.  </P> <P> Cypress is scheduled to begin Series play in today's second game (2 p.m. PDT)  against Brooklyn, Mich.  </P> <P> Asked who his starting pitcher would be, Shelton didn't hesitate. "Kerrie  (Cordero), I don't have to think. He's my horse," Shelton said.  </P> <P> Brooklyn is the Central Region champion. It enters the tournament with a 19-2  record.  </P> <P> In today's first game, Matamoros, Mexico, winner of the Latin America Region  with a 15-1 record, meets Canadian champion Trail, B.C. (13-0).  </P> <P> Cypress relied on its pitching and defense while compiling an 18-1 record and  winning the Western Regional. Shelton said he feels those things will be the  keys here.  </P> <P> In addition to Cordero, Shelton's pitchers are Bob Brito and Damon Katz.  Cypress is led in hitting by Cordero, Eddie Zamora, Pat Murphy and Jake Koziel.  </P> <P> "We've got some nits and gnats that come up and get out there (on the bases)  and these guys generally get them in," Shelton said.  </P> <P> The manager's advice to his players entering Game 1? "We've got to take this  one," he said. "One at a time, that's all we can do. It's a Little League  field. There are nine guys on the field. There aren't going to be 10,000."  </P></p>

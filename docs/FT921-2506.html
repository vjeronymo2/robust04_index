			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Marginal growth at British Mohair Pre-tax profits of British Mohair Holdings improved marginally from Pounds 2.52m to Pounds 2.62m over 1991, although turnover fell by almost Pounds 3m to Pounds 36.5m. Mr Charles Fenton, chairman, said although demand for the group's products did not measurably improve, the textile division achieved a better performance. This was partly offset, however, by lower profits from engineering. Earnings per share rose to 13.71p (12.71p) and a same again final dividend of 7.1p maintains the pay-out for the year at 8.5p.</p>

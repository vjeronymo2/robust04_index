			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / International Company News: Credit Local blazes a sell-off trail IT is no secret that the French banking industry has had a tough time over the past year or so, but at least one bank, Credit Local de France, has managed to weather the storms. At a time when other banks have suffered sharp falls in profits, or even fallen into loss, Credit Local, a specialist in local authority loans, managed to increase net profits by 11 per cent to FFr1.19bn (Dollars 210m) in 1992. It has now received its reward by being named as the first candidate for the new centre-right French government's privatisation programme. For the government the issue, involving the sale of a 30.5 per cent stake worth between FFr4bn and FFr5bn, will be an important test of the Paris stock market's appetite for privatisation stock. But for Credit Local itself, according to Mr Pierre Richard, chairman, the sale will mark the start of a new era of 'maturity'. Credit Local is a relatively new phenomenon. It traces its roots to 1987 when, following the reform of France's local authority finances, the old Caisse d'Equipement des Collectivites Locales was spun off into an independent entity and rechristened Credit Local de France. The new company started life with the state as its majority shareholder, through a direct 47.5 per cent stake and the 25 per cent belonging to Caisse des Depots, the public sector funding institution. But in 1991 Credit Local went public as first participant in the socialist government's partial privatisation programme with the FFr2.4bn sale of a 25 per cent holding. Credit Local has since fared well both on the stock market and in its own activities. French local authority finances have been fraught with problems in recent years as a number of cities have counted the cost of their over-ambitious expansion in the late 1980s. But Credit Local, which financed much of that expansion, has flourished. Last year's increase in net profits was accompanied by a 10 per cent increase in net banking income to FFr2.8bn in 1992 from FFr2.6bn in 1991 and a 12 per cent rise in net assets to FFr320bn from FFr285bn. The group has also also accelerated its international expansion by adding a 51 per cent interest in CLF Municipal Bank, a local authority loans specialist in London, and a new subsidiary in Madrid to its existing businesses in Brussels, Vienna and New York. Mr Richard hopes to continue this international drive with the aim of increasing the proportion of credit activities outside France from 10 per cent this year to 15 per cent by 1995. But neither this expansion plan, nor the forthcoming share sale, signals a significant switch in Credit Local's own strategy. Mr Richard said yesterday that the bank plans to 'carry on doing exactly the same job, but in greater depth'.</p>

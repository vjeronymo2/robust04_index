			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), Department of the Interior, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cooperation with the Rosebud and Cheyenne River Sioux Tribes, has prepared a DEIS on the proposed management of prairie dogs and livestock grazing on trust lands on the Rosebud and Cheyenne River Sioux Reservations. The alternatives for each reservation include varying levels of prairie dog poisoning and grazing management systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose and need for these actions is to maintain or improve range condition to meet tribal objectives to sustain reservation carrying capacities for livestock grazing and, therefore, increase tribal income. The Tribal Councils feel that some grazing lands are degraded and many perceive that prairie dogs compete with livestock for forage, causing economic losses to the tribes and tribal members.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The preferred alternative (Alternative 3) for the Rosebud Reservation would implement extensive range improvements and conduct chemical treatment of prairie dogs on all trust lands outside the 7,400-acre Corn Creek Management Area (CCMA, located on the western boundary of the reservation). This alternative would meet tribal grazing objectives and maintain the untreated CCMA for ecosystem biodiversity. Other alternatives considered were: continuing current grazing management program with no prairie dog treatment; implementing extensive range improvements and treating prairie dogs on all trust lands, with follow-up treatment for at least 90 percent control; and implementing extensive range improvements and treating prairie dogs on all trust lands once, with follow-up treatments only on trust lands outside the CCMA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The preferred alternative for the Cheyenne River Reservation is the Prairie Management Plan (Alternative 2) developed by the Tribe in May 1992. The plan proposes extensive range improvements with prairie dog treatment conducted only under limited circumstances, such as in cemeteries and on powwow grounds. This alternative would meet tribal grazing objectives and maintain ecosystem biodiversity. Other alternatives considered were: continuing the current grazing management program with no prairie dog treatment on trust lands; implementing extensive range improvements on trust lands, conducting no prairie dog treatment within the 10,000 acre prairie dog complex along the Morcau River, conducting prairie dog treatment on varying proportion of the remaining trust lands (25 percent treatment to 100 percent treatment); and conducting treatment of prairie dogs on 50 percent of all trust lands, including those within the prairie dog complex along the Morcau River.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agencies and individuals are urged to provide comments on this DEIS as soon as possible. All comments received by the dates given above will be considered in preparation of the final EIS. Comments made at the public hearings will not be considered comments on the DEIS unless they are submitted in writing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This notice is published pursuant to Sec. 1503.1 of the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations (40 CFR Parts 1500 through 1508) implementing the procedural requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.); Department of the Interior Manual (516 DM 1&hyph;7); and the Bureau of Indian Affairs guidelines (30 BIAM Supplements 1, 2, and 3.)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: June 9, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> John W.

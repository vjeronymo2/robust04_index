			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 26 KYODO -- Diet testimony by former  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on his own controversial  financial dealings seems unavoidable as expected testimony by  his former aide is unlikely to disperse all suspicions,  political sources said Thursday [26 May].    The ruling coalition finally agreed Thursday to opposition  demands that Hosokawa's former aide, Masatoshi Miyama, be  summoned to the House of Representatives Budget Committee.    Miyama's Diet testimony is likely to take place in the  middle  of June after the state budget for fiscal 1994 passes the lower  house, the sources said.    Hosokawa is suspected of involvement in dubious financial  deals, including a 100 million yen loan from scandal-tainted  Sagawa Kyubin business group in 1982 and the purchase of shares  in Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) in 1986.    As Hosokawa's former top secretary, Miyama likely handled  most of the management of the former premier's personal funds  but he could find it difficult to clarify all the allegations in  a way that will satisfy questioners, the sources said.    Many leaders of ruling coalition parties say Hosokawa will  probably have to testify himself to clear up suspicions, the  sources said.    Hosokawa was forced to quit the premiership in April due to  a  stalemate in Diet deliberations on the state budget, chiefly  caused by charges he might have been involved in the dubious  transactions.    Hosokawa has said he properly paid back the 100 million yen  loan to the Sagawa group by 1991, and denied he personally  touched the NTT stock purchase.    But the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and other opposition  parties suspect Hosokawa used the Sagawa money as undeclared  political donations for his successful gubernatorial election  campaign in Kumamoto Prefecture on Kyushu in western Japan.    A financial consultant who used to help Hosokawa told a news  conference in the Diet that the former premier bought the shares  himself.    The LDP, as the political party with the largest number of  lower house members, has held the fiscal 1994 budget hostage for  the past several months to push its demands for a full inquiry.    Due to an agreement on Miyama's testimony at a directors'  meeting of the budget committee, however, the LDP proposed  completing all discussions on the state budget in both chambers  before the current Diet session ends on June 29, Diet sources  said.    In lieu of the full budget, the government had to push  through two stopgap budgets to cover the first three months of  fiscal 1994 which started on April 1.</p>

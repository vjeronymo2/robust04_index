			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CUTTING BACK ON THE USE OF WATER  </P> <P> The recent announcement that Orange County has a water shortage and that we all  must take drastic measures to significantly cut our water usage rings very  hollow.  </P> <P> For the past two years, Tom Riley and other supervisors were warned by every  environmental and slow-growth organization that the hyper-development that they  were approving in South Orange County was without consideration to whether  there would be resources to support his massive building of his density homes.  </P> <P> We all were ignored, and every development in South County and in the southeast  part of the county was rubber-stamped approved. Riley led the charge.  </P> <P> Now, we are told all must sacrifice to accommodate this and future development  by severe water conservation and probably paying a lot more for our water.  </P> <P> If Riley is really serious about the drought, he would offer a law to provide  for an immediate building moratorium as they have in Santa Barbara County,  until this problem passes.  </P> <P> Until that happens, I suggest we all continue to wash our cars regularly and  make sure our lawns are regularly soaked.  </P> <P> PHILLIP WEISSBURG  </P> <P> Executive Director  </P> <P> Overgrowth California  </P> <P> San Juan Capistrano  </P></p>

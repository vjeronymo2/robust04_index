			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Caroline Faraj] </F>   [Excerpt] Dr. Fayiz al-Tarawinah, Jordanian ambassador in  Washington and head of the Jordanian delegation to the bilateral  peace talks, has described his second-day three-hour talks with  chief Israeli delegate Elyaqim Rubenstein as good and said they  constitute a good start.    Reached by telephone in Washington, Dr. al-Tarawinah told  AL-RA'Y: We began to discuss topics on the Jordanian-Israeli  agenda, delving into some details. The aim is to make sure that  the Israeli position on them has not changed since 14 September  1993, the date the agenda was signed.    Dr. al-Tarawinah added: We also reviewed the points at which  we stopped in the previous round. The purpose is to prepare for  the next round of bilateral talks and for the work of the two  sides' working teams and experts. This, of course, will take  place only after all the Arab delegations decide to collectively  participate in the next round. It is natural that the heads of  delegations are not experts or technicians in all  specializations. Therefore, we began in this second  coordination and consultation meeting at the State Department to  prepare for sub-agendas for the three working groups--  environment, water, and energy; refugees and economy; and  security and borders. He added that these agendas are still  under discussion and no final agreement regarding them has yet  been reached. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Major condemns Smith's comments LABOUR'S recent attack on standards in the Civil Service was 'astonishing and regrettable', Mr John Major said last night. He criticised Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, for a speech last week in which he accused officials and ministers of insensitivity and partiality over issues such as the Matrix Churchill affair and the decision to pay part of Mr Norman Lamont's legal bill. 'Every politician should know better than to let party political advocacy run away with his judgment on matters such as these,' Mr Major said in a speech to the Civil Service Club.</p>

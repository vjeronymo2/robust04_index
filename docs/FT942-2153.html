			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / BT ban poses monopoly risk, says Carsberg Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, raised fears yesterday about the impact of a lengthy continuation of the ban on British Telecommunications carrying entertainment services. Sir Bryan told a Financial Times conference in London that the ban 'may create local (telecommunications) monopolies in the shape of cable television companies'. 'If continued for too long, it may deny BT the opportunity to make its competitive contribution,' he added. The tone of his remarks was in sharp contrast with those of ministers and Mr Don Cruickshank, his successor as head of Oftel, the telecommunications regulator. The government's ban on BT extends until at least 2001, although Oftel is empowered to report on the desirability of lifting it from 1998. When imposed in 1991 its aim was to encourage cable companies - mostly US-owned - to invest in local cable networks, providing telecommunications services in competition with BT. BT claims the ban is constraining it from investing in the UK, since it would need revenue from interactive entertainment services to justify upgrading its local network. Pointing to the cable operators' success in attracting more than 400,000 telecoms customers within two years of launch, Sir Bryan said the ban looked set to be 'quite successful'. However, he pointedly looked forward to ending the ban to ensure effective competition. 'In this matter, timing is everything,' he said. Mr Cruickshank last month played down the prospect of even a review of the BT ban before 2001, and expressed little sympathy with BT arguments that local cable monopolies would result from delay. Mr Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, has taken a similar position. Earlier this month he rejected a Labour party proposal to lift the ban in return for BT agreeing to make the investment - estimated at about Pounds 15bn - necessary to extend fibre-optic cables into its local network.</p>

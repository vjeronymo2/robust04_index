			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Moti Bassok from Oman] </F>   [Excerpt] Senior Omani officials yesterday told Deputy  Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin: "Your visit to Oman shocked our  elite. The argument here over whether to establish relations  with you now has become legitimate. The moment there is peace,  the Gulf states will have deeper and more serious relations with  Israel than your neighbors, because we do not harbor any  residual hatred for Israel."    The next session of the water talks will apparently be held  in Kuwait in October. This will be the first time Kuwait hosts  an official Israeli delegation.    The fifth round of the multilateral water talks ended  yesterday. All the delegations will conduct a tour of Oman today  and then return to their respective capitals.    In a meeting Beilin and senior Omani officials held to sum  up  the Israeli visit, the hosts admitted that they had greatly  feared hosting the Israeli delegation and disclosed that various  Arab elements had pressured them to change their mind about  hosting the water talks. The Omani officials said that they had  feared that Israel would use the visit for propaganda purposes  and to infiltrate the Arab world.    In the beginning they attempted unsuccessfully to lower the  profile of the visit. Now, on the eve of the country-wide tour,  they feel much better and their attitude toward Israel has  changed. Oman has not fallen in love with Israel, but its  government now realizes that Israelis do not have horns, and  both countries have joint interests and can cooperate.    The local press has also joined in the publicity. Omani  citizens know that an Israeli delegation is visiting their  country. The question of whether or not this visit is followed  up depends to a great deal on the continuation of the peace  process. In principle, Oman harbors no hatred toward Israel,  like the Palestinians for example, although Israel is still  considered an enemy.    Dr. Beilin pointed out that in all his meetings, he was  constantly told that Syria is the key to peace in the Middle  East and that the Gulf states would immediately establish  relations with Israel once its problems with Syria were  resolved. The Omanis also tentatively explored whether Israel  could further their interests in the White House and on  Washington's Capitol Hill. Officials in Muscat are concerned  about a possible erosion in their economic ties with the West  due to U.S. complaints about human rights violations.    Beilin noted that Israeli desalination experts would arrive  in Muscat and that Omani experts would later conduct a  reciprocal visit. What is on the agenda is long-term  cooperation. Oman also seeks Israel's help in training  professional workers to replace the foreign workers in Oman:  the Indian managers and the blue-collar Thai workers.    Oman expects Israel to help it with marketing its products.  Today, 95 percent of its exports are shipped through Dubai  marketing chains. This dependency constitutes a heavy burden on  Muscat. In the view of Omani officials, Israel, with its  proven marketing capabilities and experience, can help Oman set  up independent marketing chains. Oman hopes that Israel will  assist in developing tourism, a field which has lain dormant so  far despite its great potential. Jerusalem will also send  medical and agricultural experts to Oman and help convert local  industry to several hi-tech branches. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: UAP Union des Assurances de Paris' first set of post-privatisation results were frankly unimpressive. The 22 per cent fall in net consolidated profits, triggered by provisions for its continuing property problems, has significantly reduced the group's chances of achieving its promised 30 per cent profits increase for the full year. Without earnings growth to support the shares, the market was left to worry about net asset value. But the collapse in bonds and equities, and continuing weakness of the property market, has made unrealised capital gains plummet. The market's concerns were reflected by a 5 per cent slump in the share price. The implications of UAP's share performance for the French privatisation programme, and particularly AGF's share sale, are serious. Investors who bought UAP at privatisation in May are nursing a 13 per cent loss. The fact that the shares have only slightly underperformed the CAC-40 index offers little comfort. If the losses begin to affect retail investor confidence, the French treasury will be faced with the prospect of offering AGF at an even bigger discount to the market.</p>

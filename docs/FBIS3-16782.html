Besides, he said, tax inspections do not keep tabs on  incomes of enterprises although there exist in every state rules  formulated through long experience under which enterprises  volunteer to pay taxes toward the budget. Such a rule, Mr.  Shokhin thinks, should also operate in relations between  components of the Russian Federation. Said the vice premier:  "Therefore we are to amend the legislative acts (laws on banks,  enterprises, entrepreneurial activities, and the tax system) in  the near future so as to quickly introduce these mechanisms of  controlling a market-based economy.    To the question from your SEGODNYA correspondent on how this  can be done quickly, Aleksandr Shokhin made it understood that  this does not mean introducing a command system: There is "an  element of emergency, but it is not an emergency in the  political sense of the word. This is a normal system for  control of a market-based economy, ...an emergency action is  warranted by the current situation in the economy and by the  fact that the 1994 draft budget forwarded by the government to  the Federal Assembly can be turned down." Therefore Mr. Shokhin  is inclined to think of the need for a collective approach to  bringing the country out of the economic crisis. The vice  premier proposed to create for this purpose a "roundtable"  bringing together the Russian Federation Government, the State  Duma, the Federation Council, and public organizations. He also  thought that there should be some corrections made: "Is it  worthwhile for us to hasten with privatizing Gazprom-type state  enterprises and oil enterprises, using vouchers. It may be  better to spare them for a privatization stage where cash is  involved."    Aleksandr Shokhin thinks that Russia will not be able to  bring down inflation and stop the continuing production slump  without such a package of measures.</p>

			<p><P> January 10, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 30TH 'WORST-DRESSED' LIST INCLUDES JACKSON, BASINGER  </P> <P> LaToya Jackson, Roseanne Barr, Demi Moore and Kim Basinger led Mr. Blackwell's  30th annual list of worst-dressed celebrities today, while praise went to Geena  Davis, Liza Minnelli, Barbara Bush and Princess Diana.  </P> <P> The acid-tongued critic also flung 1989 fashion darts at Princess Anne, Emily  Lloyd, Cher, Daryl Hannah and Paula Abdul and gave a shared dishonor to Madonna  and Sandra Bernhard.  </P> <P> Model-actress Grace Jones won "Fashion Fiasco of the Year" for an outfit  Blackwell described as "Darth Vader's S-and-M fantasy in a bird cage."  </P> <P> Jackson, a pop singer and sister of Michael Jackson, will be the "Cher for the  '90s" who is "more fashion freak than biker chic . . . in leather and chains,"  Blackwell said.  </P> <P> Television's Barr was zinged as a "bowling alley reject," former brat-packer  Moore was "a spandexed 'Nightmare on Willis Street' " and Batman's Miss  Basinger was a "parading peep-show (who) should be banished to the Batcave."  </P></p>

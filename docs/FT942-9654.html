			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Real disabled issues in danger of being lost in political storm Sir, The Nicholas Scott debacle ('Labour clamours for minister's resignation', May 11) puts us all in danger of throwing out the baby with the bathwater. Not for the first time, the real issues surrounding disabled people appear to have been lost as the political storm gathers momentum. Disabled people and their practical, day-to-day needs appear to have been pushed back into the shadows. Back to basics is not a fashionable concept. However, getting down to the nitty-gritty of ensuring that disabled people emerge from the civil rights wilderness in which they find themselves is something virtually everyone can begin to tackle: from seeing the person, not just the wheelchair, through to providing sensible and accessible housing, wheelchair-friendly public buildings and streets, decent public transport and appropriate work opportunities. The law must be changed. But in the absence of sound political thinking and sensible legislation, let us see some positive actions from the planners, architects and employers who really can make the difference. Michael Shaw, executive director, John Grooms Association for Disabled People, 10 Gloucester Drive, Finsbury Park, London N4</p>

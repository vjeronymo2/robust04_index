			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Arts: Musical agents strike up a band - Off the wall A FEW years ago some of the world's leading classical soloists and conductors rarely appeared in London: the fees offered were beneath their dignity. They still are, but sweeteners from sponsors, and promotional money from record companies, has helped entice them over. Now it is the world class orchestras that are leaving London off their visiting ist. The musical audience in the capital is too satiated with product; too conservative in its taste to give the orchestras the welcome they feel they deserve. Recent concerts by the star orchestras of Berlin and Vienna were not the box office sell outs confidently anticipated, perhaps because seat prices touched Pounds 60. And foreign orchestras, which usually lose money from touring and only do it to acquire prestige at home, are pulling in their horns in face of the global recession, and staying quietly put. This is posing problems for musical agents in London, six of whom are defying convention by merging their personal interests into the London International Orchestral Season at the South Bank from April. Six orchestras, ranging from the Chicago Symphony to the Novosibirsk Philharmonic from Siberia, are being promoted as a package of which 660 subscriptions were sold in the first two weeks. Basically each agent is organising the trip by its tied orchestra and contributing to the marketing costs of the Pounds 500,000 venture. The interest generated by a 'series' means it is worth taking the financial risk of bringing over an orchestra like the Philadelphia which has been absent for years. The South Bank, which loves seasons, is making its financial contribution. The avid concert goer who takes in all seven concerts (the Chicago plays twice) pays out Pounds 168.75p but saves 25 per cent on the full price. There could be another reason why foreign orchestras are no longer guaranteed box office hits in London: the playing of home based orchestras has improved enough to satisfy the concert going audience. * * * It is an open secret that Bernard Haitink will not renew his contract as musical director of the Royal Opera House Covent Garden when it expires at the end of the current season. Unlike his predecessors, Sir Georg Solti and Sir Colin Davis, he has scarcely hogged the podium there - this season he has confined himself to two Ring cycles and Don Giovanni. Jeremy Isaacs will need all his powerful persuasive skills to nab a proven successor. The obvious candidate for one of the biggest jobs in the music world is Claudio Abbado, but after a battering at Vienna and only recently arrived at the Berlin Philharmonic, he may not relish the additional politicking involved at Covent Garden - to say nothing of a possible period of closure if the House finally gets its redevelopment money. With associate musical director Sir Edward Downes proving his skills with the Italian repertoire in last season's revitalisation of Verdi's Attila, Isaacs could well seek a German expert. High on his list must be Christoph Dohnanyi, who has enjoyed some good evenings in the Garden pit and is booked to conduct the new Flying Dutchman in June. Covent Garden's artistic administrator Peter Katona used to manage von Dohnanyi in Germany. The main problem could be the orchestra, which finds him authoritarian. But perhaps they need a little discipline. * * * The arts are unlikely to feature prominently in the budget on March 10 but there are reports that it may contain additional money for the Foundation for Sport and the Arts, raising its honey pot from Pounds 60m a year to Pounds 100m. The Foundation is the device by which the pools companies delayed the arrival of a national lottery, which would badly hit their income. The Treasury is fond of the pools promoters - and the revenue from the betting levy - and is anti-lottery. It came up with a scam by which it cut the betting levy by 2.5 per cent in return for which the promoters coughed up Pounds 60m to give to needy causes in sport and the arts. Rather surprisingly the scheme has worked and dozens of arts companies have received up to Pounds 500,000 since last autumn from the Pounds 20m which the Foundation earmarks for the arts. Soon over 30 organisations will hear good news as the Foundation has a spending binge before its financial year ends in April. Much of the money goes into building projects, like the Pounds 500,000 for turning the Empire in Edinburgh into an opera house, and the Pounds 500,000 to shore up the Theatre Royal Norwich. But education and touring are also favoured. Proposals for a national lottery will still appear in the Tory Election Manifesto, but if there is more money for the Foundation in the budget there will be no rush to introduce a lottery whatever party forms the Government. * * * Bonhams may be by far the smallest of the four London based auction houses but it is probably the only one that has made a profit in the past year. It is currently looking for new markets which take up little space and provide a useful contribution to turnover and it will shortly hold auctions of coins, miniatures and icons. In 20th century ceramics it already leads the field. It is also considering holding sales of bags, and in April will take big time auctioneering to Jersey. Bonhams also intends to get back into wine. It stopped holding sales over a decade ago, but the country is currently awash with the stuff and hotels, restaurants and wine shippers desperately want to off-load wine to pay off their debts. The best vintages will be sold at auction, but Bonhams is considering selling wine by tender from regional centres. It would be a novel move for a saleroom, but in line with the current attitude of anything goes. The traditional auction business has been so quiet lately, especially in the main rooms of Sotheby's and Christie's, that there is time to pursue initiatives. This week Sotheby's linked up with Page and Moy to organise a series of country hotel weekends full of antique talk, while Christie's is playing host to a series of evening seminars sponsored by the FT. Starting on March 16 they lead you gently through the auction world. Details from Nigel Pullman at the FT.</p>

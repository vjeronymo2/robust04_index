			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Eurotherm accounts inconsistent EUROTHERM, the control equipment group, has admitted to an inconsistency between its 1990 and 1991 accounts following discussions with the Financial Reporting Review Panel, the UK accounting watchdog. In a note to its latest accounts circulated yesterday, the company has restated restructuring provisions which it treated as extraordinary charges in 1990 but partly wrote-back as exceptional profits in 1991. The 1991 accounts were not qualified by Arthur Andersen, the company's auditor. The restated figures treat the provision as an exceptional item, which has the effect of reducing 1990 earnings per share from 19.6p to 12.3p. It makes no difference to the 1991 and 1992 results. In an announcement yesterday coinciding with publication of the accounts, the Review Panel said it welcomed the company's restatement and it had concluded its examination of the accounts. Mr Sydney Treadgold, secretary to the Review Panel, said: 'We feel that honour has been satisfied.' He said that in general such treatments 'were not right in terms of correctness and consistency.' But Mr Robert Biddle, Eurotherm's finance director, called the Review Panel 'a kangaroo court' which had made the assumption that the company was 'guilty until proven innocent.' He said: 'I'm just amazed. I would have thought the panel had bigger fish to fry.' He said that restating items in prior years was 'comparing apples with oranges' and argued that the company had tried to comply as quickly as possible with the new accounting standards. He said the differing treatment was the result of the company adopting by the 1991 accounts the second pronouncement from the urgent issues task force of the Accounting Standards Board, which requires fundamental restructurings to be treated as exceptional items. Mr Treadgold said: 'The panel makes every effort to explain its procedures and gives companies every opportunity to explain its accounting treatment. It is anxious to come to a voluntary agreement whenever possible.' Eurotherm made a Pounds 2.3m extraordinary charge for a fundamental restructuring of its manufacturing activities in the year to October 31 1990, which had no effect on pre-tax profits. In the following year, however, it wrote back as an exceptional gain Pounds 513,000 for which it had over-provided in 1990, which increased pre-tax profits by 8 per cent to Pounds 7.2m.</p>

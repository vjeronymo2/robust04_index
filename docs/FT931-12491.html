			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Technology: Consultant's critique One message running through all the cases studied so far is that change is here to stay. In every application of IT to date, the human issues have been more important than technical ones. Carleton discovered that reluctance to change can be the sole impediment to a new project. The company faced a big change in culture when trying to integrate the drawing office with the production side. The tradition of the job being complete when the drawings were handed over ended with the introduction of computer-aided design. Now designers are required to understand the manufacture of their furniture, as well as its aesthetic qualities. Change must be managed as a business problem in its own right. Reluctance can turn into bloody-mindedness if not handled carefully. I think Carleton did too little preparation for the effects on work practices and paid the price with an overrun. The Cad system forced greater changes in the interaction between people than in the way they produce drawings. While the design of the new system gained consistency from being put together by just Steve Dodds and a consultant, it suffered from reduced involvement of the key staff - the line managers. They were involved at the specification stage, but appeared to have less say in the detailed implementation. Perhaps more participation throughout the process might have led to a smoother introduction. The information technology implementation was not the sole source of cultural change. The company itself underwent big structural changes as a result of growth and acquisition. Dodds faces a common problem: maximising the use of central resources but allowing autonomy in individual divisions. Despite the problems, the system is now producing tangible benefits for Carleton. Fast turnaround means being able to serve customers better and control costs. The author is a consultant at Software Design and Construction, of Milton Keynes</p>

			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIDDEN HOMELESS NEED WOMEN'S SUPPORT  </P> <P> I felt both compassion and anger for the people depicted in this article. This  privileged social class is intolerant of their impoverishment and yet their  goal is not to change the system, but to return to it as fast as they can.  </P> <P> Their social awakening seems self-serving since their determination is not to  challenge their class to change, but merely to get enough money to return to  it. By hiding this situation from their kids, they enable them to perpetuate a  system that victimizes them.  </P> <P> If these women communicated their situation with their kids instead of letting  them climb the economic ladder unfettered, it might impel (their children to  support) social change. Why do none of these women want to revolt against these  families and friends who cloister themselves in an ill-gotten world of  privilege? Can they really want to return to the status quo, having seen at  what price it is maintained?  </P> <P> MICHELE NICHOLS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

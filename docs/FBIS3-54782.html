Wages and all types of  bonus payments in the republic are now being strictly linked to  the amount and quality of labor. By doing this, the leadership  of Kazakhstan hopes to stop the practice of adjusting money  payments to cover inflation. The new procedure for payments is  compulsory for all enterprises. Inspection bodies have been  given the right to withdraw from consumption funds any unmerited  sums that have been paid out and to transfer them to local  budget revenues.</p>

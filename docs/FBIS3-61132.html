			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Declaration of the Association of Totalitarian Communist </F> Regime Victims]    [Text] A declaration adopted by participants of the Second  Congress of the Association of Victims of the Totalitarian  Communist Regime of Moldova was passed for distribution to the  Moldova-Press Agency. It states:    The Second Congress of Victims of the Totalitarian Communist  Regime of Moldova which took place on 20 November 1993 noted  with profound concern the aggravation of the socioeconomic and  political situation within the republic capable of leading to  social explosions with severe consequences.    The steady and uncontrolled rise in prices for essential  food  items, complete devaluation of monetary savings of the  population, non-indexation and delayed payment of wages,  pensions, stipends, and grants, the growth of mafia-like groups  and the blossoming of corruption led to a state where all of  society was engulfed by a severe economic crisis and most of the  population lacks any guarantees or certainty about what happens  tomorrow.    Such economic chaos is a consequence of the blocking of  democratic reforms in the economy by conservative forces, the  inability of the current leadership to manage a sovereign and  independent state, and the lack of an effective program for  transition to a normal economy.    At a time when the population is growing poorer with every  day, the number of ministries, departments, and governmental and  parliamentary commissions is growing inordinately, naturally,  along with the ranks of officials as hundreds of government and  parliamentary delegations travel by air to all countries of the  world while hundreds of delegations arrive in our country which  requires the expenditure of huge sums of money without any  practical benefit. The government finds money for the  maintenance of excessively numerous structures as well as for  the foreign trips and reception of delegations, but not for the  indexation of wages, pensions, and stipends.    Privatization of state property is fiction. It is conducted  within the narrow sphere of a corresponding department. The  process of endowing peasants with land is being blocked and  confiscated property and nationalized real estate is not being  returned to victims of the totalitarian Communist regime.  Moreover they are compelled to acquire above-norm living space  at astronomical prices, including balcony areas, and apartments  being privatized.    The president of the republic is not fulfilling his campaign  promises regarding the conduct of democratic reforms, while a  number of edicts of the head of state are being ignored by  parliament and the government.    Unqualified affiliation with the Commonwealth of Independent  States and the so-called economic union, carried out to the  detriment of the economic and cultural integration with Romania  and development of economic ties with western countries, will  further aggravate the economic recession in the republic.    The policy being conducted by the current government in the  field of taxation, excise taxes and licensing led to the  bankruptcy of most of the producers and is stimulating the  growth of speculation, crime, and mafia-like structures.    A number of errors by the government likewise led to a  decline in culture, education, public health, and the lack of  social protection for impoverished segments of the population.    Taking into account the socio-political and socioeconomic  situation that developed in the republic, participants of the  Second Congress of the Association of Victims of the  Totalitarian Communist Regime of Moldova deem it necessary to  raise the question concerning elaboration and conduct of a broad  and concrete program of economic and socio-political reforms by  the leadership of the republic, which would ensure the following:    1. Stimulation and development of the reform of the taxation  policy and production enterprises regardless of forms of  ownership.    2. Accelerated privatization of state property under strict  government control.    3. Most effective functioning of all state structures in the  development of small and medium-scale businesses.    4. Endowment of peasants with land, adoption of the law on  private land ownership with the right of sale and purchase;  transformation of kolkhozes into joint-stock companies,  cooperatives, and farms with simultaneous development of a  market infrastructure, including creation of credit societies,  land banks, cooperatives and joint-stock companies in the  material supply of farmers and individual farms as well as in  the sale of their products.    5. Along with the restoration of economic ties with the  eastern republics, full social and cultural integration with  Romania through the signing of a fraternal treaty with it,  coupled with development of economic ties with western countries  through the attraction of investments in the development of  industry and the agricultural sector.    6. Resolution of the Dniester region conflict along with  differences with southern regions, withdrawal of the 14th Army,  ensurance of the integrity of the republic with the aid of  international organizations, unconditional release of Tiraspol  political prisoners of the Ilashku group.    7. The swiftest conduct of territorial-administrative and  judicial reforms and observance of human rights in all spheres.    8. Liquidation of the bureaucratic system through a  wholesale  decrease in the number of ministries, departments, and  commissions, as well as in the size of their staffs.    9. Stimulation of the development of culture, science,  public  health, and education.    10. Social protection of the impoverished segments of the  population--pensioners, invalids, elderly persons living alone,  mothers with many children, employees and workers whose wages  are below the minimum subsistence level through the indexation  of wages, pensions, stipends, and grants and also through a  cutback in irrational expenditures by state structures.    11. Restoration of the rights of all victims of the  totalitarian Communist regime through the observance and  amendment of the law on rehabilitation of political victims of  the totalitarian Communist regime of 8 December 1992, to wit:    Return of property, real estate, and other confiscated or  nationalized assets or award of compensation for victims or  their descendants with the conclusion of an agreement for that  purpose with Russia--the country which is obligated to provide  compensation for all the material and moral harm caused victims  of the totalitarian Communist regime.    Free privatization of all living space for families or heirs  of those who suffered because of the totalitarian regime;    Recognition of the time spent by victims and members of  their  families registered in Russia and in other republics of the  former USSR where they were forced to live after exile until  their return to the republic as full active service in the  computation of pensions and privatization of state property.    12. Indexation of monetary savings in savings banks at the  expense of privatization of state property through the issuance  of special bonds.    13. Restoration of history and national culture, the state  language, national traditions, as well as ethnic development of  the population of the republic.    Adopted at the Second Congress of Victims of the  Totalitarian  Communist Regime.    Chisinau, 20 November 1993</p>

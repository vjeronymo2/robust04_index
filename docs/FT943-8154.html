			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: World Bank sees short-lived commodity boom The present surge in commodity prices is likely to be much smaller and more short-lived than that of the 1970s, according to the World Bank. In its latest quarterly report on Commodity Markets and Developing Countries, the bank points out that circumstances differ significantly from those of the 1970s. The biggest difference is that the countries of the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe, which were large commodity importers in the 1970s, now lack the foreign exchange to fund high levels of imports. The report also says that oil-producing countries in Opec, which were big importers when oil prices surged in the 1970s, are now in a weaker economic position. Thirdly, it says, many developing countries which imported large quantities of raw commodities such as grains when their incomes rose, were now self-sufficient or even net exporters. Nevertheless, the bank says certain commodities that have risen strongly, coffee for example, may still have spectacular price increases to come. 'Coffee prices are expected to remain high for several years since recent investments in new tree plantings have been low and the lag between new plantings and production is long - new plantings take about three years to begin production and eight years to reach maximum yields,' says the report. 'Thus significant production increases are not possible before 1997. Coffee is poised for a significant price boom even if no further production problems occur.' It adds, however, that expected sharp increases in output by 1997 will lead to a rapid drop in world prices, as occurred after 1977 and 1986. The bank says its commodity price index will be driven higher by further sharp rises in a few commodities that have been severely depressed, but that nearly two-thirds of the 33 commodities covered are expected to show some increase between now and 2000. Cotton prices, driven up by 55 per cent between October and June by poor crops in the major producing countries, are likely to remain high for 12 to 18 months, it says. World production should rebound in 1994, but disease and pest problems will delay a full recovery in important cotton regions of China and south Asia. Oil prices are expected to remain firm for the rest of the year because of relatively tight markets but prices could weaken significantly next year if Iraqi crude exports return to the international market, the report says. It argues that copper prices, up 45 per cent since November because of stronger demand and a big reduction in stocks, should fall as new production comes on stream in the second half of the year. 'More moderate increases in demand of 2-3 per cent a year are not likely to absorb large production increases expected in 1995 and 1996.' Grain prices should also be lower this year and next if yields return to normal, since supply disruptions rather than increases in demand are responsible for current high prices, the report says. But if yields are well below average for a second year, further price rises will be on the cards. Commodity Markets and the Developing Countries, a World Bank quarterly.

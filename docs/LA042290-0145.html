			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SANTA ANITA;  </P> <P> FIELD FOR SAN JUAN COMES UP SHORT  </P> <P> In terms of quantity, the 51st running of the $500,000 San Juan Capistrano  today is lacking.  </P> <P> Only seven horses entered the 1 3/4-mile marathon on the next-to-last program  of Santa Anita's 90-day meeting.  </P> <P> To most observers, only three members of the field have a realistic shot at the  $275,000 top prize -- Hawkster, El Senor and Frankly Perfect. Live The Dream,  Delegant, Valdali and Santangelo all seem mere pretenders.  </P> <P> Jeff Tufts' morning line reinforces this belief. Santa Anita's linemaker  established El Senor the 8-5 favorite, Hawkster is 9-5, Frankly Perfect 5-2,  then comes Valdali, Live The Dream and Delegant all at 15-1 and Santangelo is  20-1.  </P> <P> The strategy for Hawkster in the Capistrano will be simple. He will go right to  the lead and attempt to become the first horse to go wire-to-wire in the Grade  I race since Obraztsovy held off Exploded in 1981. The year before, John Henry  won in the same fashion.  </P> <P> Hawkster's jockey and trainer, Pat Valenzuela and Ron McAnally, are both  familiar with those two victories. Valenzuela rode Obraztsovy for the  then-biggest win of his career and McAnally was John Henry's boss.  </P> <P> After two futile attempts on the dirt, a surface he hasn't won on since the  fall of 1988, Hawkster opened up on his five rivals in last month's San Luis  Rey with some fast fractions. Not until the final yards was he collared by  Prized, who is unbeaten in three starts on the turf and who has earned himself  a place as one of the nation's premier thoroughbreds.  </P> <P> Hawkster will be carrying three fewer pounds today and his recent works  indicate he has lost none of his sharpness. It also doesn't hurt that front  runners have been doing well in the waning weeks of the season.  </P> <P> Frankly Perfect had a two-race winning streak end in the 1 1/2-mile San Luis  Rey. He broke a trifle slowly, then was the first one to take a run at  Hawkster. He came up empty late and wound up third, beaten by two lengths.  </P> <P> Charlie Whittingham, who is seeking his 15th win in this race, thought the  5-year-old Perrault horse moved too soon last time and says he has been  training well.  </P> <P> Frankly Perfect will also be making his first start for new owner Jerry Buss.  The Lakers' owner purchased an interest in the horse, who is also owned by the  Kings' Bruce McNall and Wayne Gretzky. Presumably, Buss bought the same  interest in the horse which, for a short time, belonged to actor Sylvester  Stallone.  </P> <P> Without question, El Senor was finishing fastest in the San Luis Rey. Far back  early, the 6-year-old roan really took hold late and was beaten by only a  half-length by Frankly Perfect.  </P> <P> It was the first start of the year for the son of Valdez, who hadn't been out  since finishing seventh in the Breeders' Cup Turf. He figures to move forward  off that race and the additional distance certainly won't be a hinderance.  </P> <P> If any of the others are to spring an upset, Live The Dream, Charlie  Whittingham's other entrant, is the most likely. He lost ground the entire  journey in the 1 1/2-mile San Luis Obispo Feb. 19 in an effort that was much  better than his eighth-place finish would indicate.  </P> <P> Distance shouldn't pose a problem for the Northern Baby colt and he will carry  eight fewer pounds than Frankly Perfect, seven fewer than Hawkster and five  fewer than El Senor.  </P> <P> Delegant, who is trained by Michael Whittingham, finished fifth in the San Luis  Rey. He drops 11 pounds off that race, but he wasn't able to beat Frankly  Perfect when the latter had trouble in the San Luis Obispo and he was getting  eight pounds that day.  </P> <P> Valdali was a distant third at 8-5 against much weaker competition. His only  pluses are that he can go a mile and three quarters and he'll be ridden by Gary  Stevens.  </P> <P> The only good race Santangelo has run since coming to this country from South  America was on the dirt. He was second to Opening Verse in a Feb. 15 allowance  race. Nor was he disgraced when fifth in the Santa Anita Handicap. So,  naturally, he's trying the grass again, where he has finished 10th, seventh and  fourth in three U.S. tries and has failed in 16 of 18 attempts lifetime.  </P> <P> Continuing his love affair with the Santa Anita hillside sprint course, Coastal  Voyage made even-money look like a gift with an easy victory in the $102,500  San Simeon Handicap Saturday.  </P> <P> Successful in four of five starts on the unique turf layout, the 6-year-old  Coastal horse beat Patchy Groundfog by 2 3/4 lengths while covering about 6 1/2  furlongs in 1:12 1/5. Raise A Stanza was third and Wonder Dancer last in the  compact field.  </P> <P> "It's been a good day for the barn," said Eduardo Inda, McAnally's assistant.  Earlier, Silver Ending had scored a 6-1 surprise in the Arkansas Derby. "It's  nice to win for Ron. He's just a super boss."  </P> <P> Ridden by Alex Solis, Coastal Voyage earned $60,000 for owner John Brunetti  with his eighth victory in 15 career starts and returned $4.  </P> <P> Horse Racing Notes  </P> <P> Laffit Pincay escaped serious injury when Another Lady flipped in the gate  shortly before the second race was to start. "I got pinned down there," said  Pincay, who missed the third race, then returned for the rest of the card. "I  was very tight and all the weight was on my leg. I really thought she broke it.  The muscles on both side of my knee are sore, but there was no damage to the  bone. It hurts when I walk, but not when I ride. I'll put more ice on it  tonight and see how it feels tomorrow."  </P> <P> Surprisingly, Forty Niner Days was the lukewarm 3-1 favorite at Santa Anita for  the simulcast of the California Derby from Golden Gate. Forty Niner Days, who  showed brief speed and stopped, was 7-1 up north.  </P></p>

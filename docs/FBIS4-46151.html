			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ramesh Vinayak, Amarnath K. Menon in Hyderabad, and Uday </F> Mahurkar in Ahmedabad]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] In mid '88 -- the post  Operation Black Thunder period -- terrorist success, even  against the famed National Security Guard [NSG], had become  directly proportional to demoralisation within the state police.  Gill decided to make commandos out of his own policemen, a  tactic based on the simple reasoning that a properly motivated  and trained commando force having roots in Punjab would fight  terrorists better.    Drawn from the Punjab Armed Police, six companies of the  police personnel underwent six months of training by army and  Border Security Force [BSF] instructors, and were then deployed  in Tarn Taran in 1989 on an experimental basis. Heartened by  their progress against the militants, four more commando  battalions were raised, a final moment of truth being "Operation  Night Dominance" in late 1992 when the commandos finally pushed  the terrorists to the wall.    All doubts about the efficacy of this brainchild were erased  by the figures: till January 31 last year, the commandos were  involved in 117 encounters in which 222 terrorists were killed,  including 56 hardcore ones, and 283 weapons seized. Only 14  commandos were killed in the anti-terrorist drive since 1989 as  against more than 1,300 police casualties during this period.  Today, Punjab has a 10,482-strong commando contingent, the  biggest in the country, and as IG [Inspector General]  (Commandos) P. Lal says: "They are the finest fighting machine."    The repercussions of this success story were immediate. The  Assam Government, for example, requisitioned two battalions from  the Punjab Police to deal with ULFA [United Liberation Front of  Assam] insurgents, and even sent down a batch of 90 Assam Police  officers for commando training in Punjab.    Training depends on each state's requirement, whether it be  urban terrorism in Bombay or guerrilla warfare in the jungles of  Andhra Pradesh. Commando tactics, parajumping, defensive  driving, rock climbing, sniper training and field survival  techniques, once absent from the policeman's dictionary are now  an intrinsic part of his vocabulary. Physical and written tests  are de rigueur, and equally common are psychologists in the  state selection panels. Every sort of terrorist situation is  simulated and Andhra Pradesh's Special Security Force (SSF)  commandos are forced to understand and undergo the same rigours  of a militant by spending a week in the jungle without food or  water. Not surprisingly the drop out rate is steep. In Punjab  about 25 per cent while at the Special Security Group of Tamil  Nadu (SSG), of the 6,000 officers and constables initially  selected, not more than 200 will eventually make the grade.    With training comes weaponry. Standard weapons now include  automatic assault rifles and 9 mm pistols. Tamil Nadu has  imported 50 MP-5 rifles -- a close-quarter battle rifle -- and  70 fibre glass Glock pistols at a cost of Rs 50 lakh. The SSG  is the only elite force equipped with imported Motorola  communication systems. The Punjab commandos have 51 mm mortar  and will soon have 450 imported sniper rifles.    Yet, despite every effort, shortcomings in some states  remain. Incentives are often not enough and facilities and  equipment not always available and affordable. Although some  units, like the Special Operations Squad (SOS) in Maharashtra  get 50 per cent more pay than their counterparts, a special  clothing allowance and injury compensation, it is not always the  case. The West Bengal commando draws the same salary as any  other policeman there, forcing a top police official to remark:  "In the absence of special incentives, motivation to become  commandos is lacking among our police ranks." In Delhi  sub-inspectors get Rs [rupees] 100 extra and a special diet  allowance of Rs 4 a day.    Funds are a source of worry too. West Bengal's commando unit  is floundering because of lack of resources. In Haryana the  situation has necessitated some improvisation. The commandos  there are using a railway bridge on a canal as a water obstacle  course. And in Madhya Pradesh, a police officer admits that "if  we get the guns we don't get the ammunition." There is also the  question over their role, for there are states where the  commando has become a glorified bodyguard, in danger of becoming  a footman for every VIP with a security paranoia.    Yet, commando operations in some states are advancing  rapidly. Haryana has set up a 40-acre commando complex near  Karnal which cost Rs 3 crore while the SSG has an exclusive 100  acre shooting range for reflex shooting training.    Punjab, which has constantly set the pace, is as usual ahead  of others. The police will shortly set up a computerised combat  shooting range at a cost of Rs 1 crore, a facility which only  the NSG has. Also being acquired are an Infantry Weapons Effect  Simulator System whereby an actual combat situation can be  simulated, and a Small Arms Training System to sharpen shooting  ability, both of which will cost Rs 23 lakh. Also in the  pipeline is a Rs 80 lakh water obstacle course and the purchase  of 270 sighting telescopes.    A creditable spinoff in raising crack outfits has been that  it has ushered in a commando culture within police forces. The  basic purpose is to upgrade the policing without involving elite  commandos in normal law and order problems. In Punjab, about  4,500 policemen have been given commando training and they are  called district commandos. The SSG has trained more than 8,000  inspectors and sub- inspectors in batches so far and the Gujarat  commandos have trained more than 400 policemen from districts.  The SSF has raised a smaller commando unit -- City Guards -- to  check terrorist activities in Hyderabad.    The message is clear. India's police force, a target for  taunts, will no longer turn their untrained backs on crises any  more. In a nation where so many areas are torn by internal and  external strife, the police commando has emerged to play a  significant role. Says Haryana DGP, Kalyan Rudra: "The  emerging complex security scenario requires the police forces to  acquire deterrent teeth." They have, and they are ready to bite.</p>

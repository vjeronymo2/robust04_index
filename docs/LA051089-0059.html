			<p><P> May 10, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA BOULEVARD PANEL DIVIDED OVER GRIDLOCK PLANS  </P> <P> Members of a citizens committee searching for ways to prevent gridlock on  Ventura Boulevard are wrapping up a 2 1/2-year study the way they started it:  squabbling among themselves.  </P> <P> Homeowners and businessmen on the 20-member panel are about a month away from  finishing their work and issuing recommendations that would propose that future  growth along the 17-mile boulevard be tied to traffic congestion.  </P> <P> Committee members are considering suggesting that new construction be severely  limited in areas such as Encino, where there already are frequent traffic jams.  They are studying use of a "trip equation" as a way of forecasting how future  development would add to existing congestion. The equation would determine  traffic volume on the basis of the size of new buildings.  </P> <P> The committee's preliminary proposal envisions that the boulevard can handle an  additional 8.6 million square feet of commercial development and 30,000 more  car trips a day by the year 2010. There are now about 19 million square feet of  commercial development and about 70,000 daily trips on the boulevard.  </P> <P> According to the latest draft of the preliminary plan, developers along the  thoroughfare should be required to pay a fee based on the estimated number of  daily trips that their projects would generate. That money would be used for  future traffic improvements on the boulevard.  </P> <P> But the homeowners and business representatives on the Los Angeles City  Council-appointed committee are at odds over exactly how the calculations  should be made, how much growth should be allowed and how much money should be  collected.  </P> <P> Their rift surfaced Tuesday when both sides responded to a newspaper report  that erroneously announced that the Planning Commission was meeting to consider  the boulevard plan.  </P> <P> The report prepared for the meeting prompted fears by homeowners that  businessmen, who form the majority on the panel, were bypassing final committee  debate by taking the preliminary plan straight to the commission. The  homeowners hurriedly prepared a "minority report" that called for an overall  tightening of the recommendations.  </P> <P> "We feel some adjustments will make it more functional, realistically  creative," the dissidents wrote. Tougher requirements would "delay potential  traffic gridlock and be more acceptable to residents and users of Ventura  Boulevard," they concluded.  </P> <P> Said Louise Frankel, a Tarzana homeowner representative who joined residential  committee members from Encino, Sherman Oaks and Woodland Hills in signing the  minority report: "If you'd been sitting with us two years listening to this,  you'd have trepidations too."  </P> <P> The committee's majority members suggested that their upcoming proposal is  plenty creative, however. In fact, said panel member Nick Brestoff, a Woodland  Hills lawyer, the trip equation has the potential to eventually be used  throughout the city to tame growth and traffic problems.  </P> <P> But planning commissioners refused to listen to either side's arguments. They  said the matter was before them Tuesday only as one of several generalized  status reports on long-range Planning Department projects.  </P> <P> Richard Platkin, a planning staff member who is working with the committee on  the study, said additional panel meetings will be scheduled when a revised  preliminary draft of the group's recommendations can be prepared.  </P> <P> The two sides apparently will have plenty to debate when they meet again.  </P> <P> The homeowners want all new buildings along the boulevard between Cahuenga  Boulevard in Studio City to Shoup Avenue in Woodland Hills restricted to two  stories in height to "preserve the rural and relaxed shopping atmosphere." But  the business representatives favor heights ranging from two stories in  congested areas to six floors in lightly developed Woodland Hills.  </P> <P> Minority members want the number of trips that the boulevard can absorb by 2010  to be apportioned among the street's five communities on the basis of a sliding  scale that is one-third tighter than that suggested by the majority.  </P> <P> The minority wants developers to pay $5,000 for each trip generated daily by  their projects as determined by that sliding scale. The majority favors a  $2,000 fee.  </P> <P> The minority wants all existing business owners on the boulevard to be assessed  a separate fee to help pay for traffic improvements, new parking facilities,  better landscaping and street cleaning, police foot patrols and graffiti  removal. The majority does not include such a proposal in its preliminary  report.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Construction Ban  </P> <P> The minority wants a construction ban within half a mile of the most congested  intersections. The majority says computerized signals, rush-hour parking bans  and "traffic improvements for the corridor's critical intersections" would  allow for "adequate levels of service."  </P> <P> The end-of-the-study acrimony is reminiscent of arguing that occurred when the  committee began its work in 1987 and quickly became polarized into homeowner  and business interest camps.  </P> <P> When homeowners initially proposed that bans on parking and daytime deliveries  be considered for the boulevard and a median fence be installed to prevent  traffic-snarling U-turns, businessmen reacted by calling for the construction  of new municipal parking garages on boulevard land now used by city fire  stations, libraries and electrical distribution stations. None of those ideas  survived.  </P> <P> Planning Commission President William G. Luddy said the commission will not  look at the committee's recommendations until its members finally vote to send  them to City Hall. Public hearings and workshops will precede any commission  decision on the boulevard plan.  </P> <P> "I'll be very interested to see how this plays itself out," Luddy told the two  sides.  </P></p>

			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / UK Company News: QMH plans to prevent second restructuring Bankers working on the Pounds 1.3bn Queens Moat Houses refinancing have learnt the lesson of Heron International's recent difficulties and designed proposals which should prevent the need for a second restructuring in short order. Heron completed a refinancing last September only to find that a crashing Spanish property market has already made a second one necessary. Barclays Bank is the lead bank on both Heron and QMH. Proposals have been passed by the QMH banks' steering committee and have this week been sent to the rest of the hotel group's 65 bank lenders. The idea of the QMH restructuring plan is to convert an initial amount of debt into equity, which will dilute current shareholders substantially but not by as much as some have feared. If the company prospers and trading conditions pick up, this limited conversion should be sufficient. However, there is a back-up element in the proposals under which a further tranche of debt could be converted into equity if trading conditions worsen or the company fails to meet profit targets. This would involve diluting existing shareholders to a small percentage of the total equity. The plan is said by its proponents to be robust and prudent, and not dependent on asset sales to succeed. Holders of the group's two debenture stocks, which have a total nominal value of Pounds 215m, stand in a strong bargaining position as they have security over a list of QMH's hotels. They can expect their interest to be paid, although they cannot escape sharing some of the pain. Bank lenders will see some of their debt converted to equity now, some earmarked for a later conversion if necessary, some remaining as debt but not receiving interest in the short term, and a small proportion being serviced. The timetable for approval of the proposals is lengthy, although it is hoped that meetings of shareholders, the final stage in the process, can be held before the summer holidays. If the plans are approved by shareholders the group's shares, which are suspended, should be relisted.</p>

			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / OECD will seek backing for plan to cut jobless Finance and labour ministers from the world's leading industrialised nations will be asked next week to endorse 57 detailed proposals to cut the 35m army of unemployed in their countries. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development will seek the backing of its 25 member governments for the recommendations as a step towards drawing up tailor-made unemployment reduction programmes for each member state. The plan is that the programmes should be ready in autumn to catch a hoped-for quickening of growth in the industrialised world that would lessen the pain of some of the planned measures. Against a background of strong US growth and rising hopes of recovery in Japan and continental Europe, the OECD secretariat is expected to tell ministers next week that growth in the OECD area will be faster than last December's forecasts of 2.1 per cent for this year and 2.7 per cent for 1995. The jobs paper, which will be put forward by Mr Jean-Claude Paye, the secretary general, is likely to be an uncomfortable read for many governments in Europe, where the organisation envisages an increase in unemployment to 22m next year. It is expected to urge governments to look at such institutions as minimum wages, arguing that these increase youth unemployment. It will advocate changes to tax and benefit systems in many countries, so that the benefit safety net targets people in real need. It will propose cuts in Europe's high non-wage labour costs such as payroll taxes, suggesting that governments levy taxes on consumption if they need to make up revenue shortfalls. It is also expected to advocate lower direct taxes where this would make it more attractive for employers to hire people with low skills for low wage jobs. However, the OECD will underline the importance of social policies to ensure that people on low wages have acceptable incomes. The study strongly supports many of the changes made by the UK government to make Britain's labour market more flexible. The OECD's aim is not to put forward a magic solution for cutting unemployment, recognising that its recommendations will apply with different force in the various member states, depending on local conditions. The paper will be discussed by ministers in Paris on Tuesday. Once endorsed, the document will form the basis of further discussions on combatting unemployment among the Group of Seven leading industrial countries at their annual economic summit in Naples next month.

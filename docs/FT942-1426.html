			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Possible changes to company annual reports suggested Mr Michael Lawrence, chief executive of the Stock Exchange, said yesterday that the exchange might consider making compulsory the Operating and Financial Review which is now only a suggestion to be included in company annual reports. He told the conference that the review provided useful information to investors and there might be a case for enforcement. Sir David Tweedie, chairman of the Accounting Standards Board, called for greater forward-looking information in company accounts. He endorsed calls for revisions to company law to reduce the hundreds of irrelevant financial disclosures required. The board has commissioned research to identify candidates. He also said the board was considering introducing a revised version of FRS 3, the standard on the profit and loss account, that would focus on trading profits and exclude profits from other transactions, such as property sales.</p>

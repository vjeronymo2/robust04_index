			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Survey of Aerospace (9): Gulf war set a new pattern - Helicopters' military potential is widening HELICOPTERS are not only versatile but also surprisingly robust machines - and that is their curse as well as their blessing. When civil operators or defence ministries want to trim non-essential spending, replacement purchases of helicopters can nearly always be put off. Take the Wessex, a British version of the Sikorsky S-58, dating from the early 1960s and used by the RAF for transport and search and rescue. It is 20 years since it merited an entry in Jane's All the World's Aircraft, but the Wessex is still in service and could well be 35 years old before it is retired. Delays in new orders, particularly from the military, are the constant frustration of US and European helicopter manufacturers. In the longer term, prospects for military helicopters would appear to be bright, at least in comparison with most other defence equipment sectors. Helicopters proved their worth on the modern battlefield during the land campaign to recover Kuwait in early 1991 - and as happened when they were used by US forces in Vietnam, revealed new potentialities. The US AH-64 Apache found another role when it rounded up Iraqi prisoners. In future, the helicopter's usefulness should increase with the remodelling and reduction of forces, particularly in order to move troops rapidly. In the short term, however, industry analysts expect a fall in deliveries of military helicopters, which have been running at a rate of about 500-600 a year excluding the former communist countries. This is despite signs of demand from some developing countries. The civil market, where total sales run at about 1,000 a year including about 400 very light helicopters, is expected to show some increase. In the small helicopter sector, there is a move towards twin-engined rather than single-engined models, and in the offshore industry the trend is towards larger helicopters. However, growth is not expected to be spectacular. Military orders will continue to provide the industry's backbone on both sides of the Atlantic. Despite the lessons from the Gulf conflict, both the US and the leading European nations are taking their time to decide on their future helicopter needs following the collapse of the Soviet military bloc. The new RAH-66 Comanche armed scout helicopter, a programme which Boeing and Sikorsky won only last year in a competition against the other two US manufacturers, McDonnell Douglas and Bell Helicopter Textron, has been put on the shelf. Development of prototypes is continuing, but the Pentagon has put off production to an unspecified date, leaving the US Army to make do with an ungraded fleet of Apache and OH-58 Kiowa aircraft, the latter originally developed in the 1960s. Another major US project, the tilt-rotor V-22 Osprey, a hybrid between a helicopter and a fixed-wing aeroplane being developed by Bell and Boeing, was 'killed' and then - in a way that only ever seems to happen in the US - brought back to life. In the face of a strong congressional lobby, the Pentagon agreed in July to allocate Dollars 1.5bn towards the cost of an initial six production versions. But there is no commitment to follow this up with purchases for the US Marines. Elsewhere, projects have been put back. The NH-90 military utility and naval helicopter, involving France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, has been leading a precarious existence, with the French government balking at development costs. Following an agreement in May to award a Dollars 1.7bn development contract, France has postponed planned deliveries of the army version by two years to the beginning of the next century, in the meantime extending the life of current Puma models. The Franco-German Tiger, an anti-tank and support helicopter, has suffered a similar fate, with both partners delaying initial deliveries by two years. The UK, whose joint project to build a light attack helicopter with Italy, Spain and the Netherlands predictably collapsed in 1990, is due to invite tenders this October for an anti-tank helicopter. That, too, might be delayed. The Ministry of Defence is insisting on holding a competition despite pressure within the army to opt for an immediate purchase of McDonnell Douglas's Apache. Rivals to the latest Apache model, which would be assembled by Westland in the UK, are the Eurocopter Tiger and a version of Bell's AH-IW Supercobra, known as the Cobra Venom. British Aerospace announced in February a preliminary agreement to study collaboration on the Tiger for the British army, and GEC Avionics is heading the Cobra Venom bid with Bell. The MoD aims to sign a contract in mid-1994. Eventually it is expected to buy about 125 of the anti-tank helicopters, for a value expected to be more than Pounds 2bn. Current plans are that the army should start operating the helicopters in 1997, but the ministry has told manufacturers this target 'may not be compatible with the most cost-effective solution'. A later date might increase the Tiger's chances. Doubts about the future of the Anglo-Italian EH101, a three-engined helicopter designed for naval, utility and civilian uses, were lifted a year ago when the UK government placed a Pounds 1.5bn contract with IBM of the US to manage the supply of 44 EH101 Merlins for the Royal Navy. IBM had bid for the contract in collaboration with Westland, which has been developing the EH101 airframe with Agusta of Italy. The decision to appoint a prime contractor reflected concerns about the timing and cost of the programme. The helicopter has been under development since 1984. In 1985 it was expected to be in service in 1990, although the House of Commons defence committee ventured to suggest even then that this might be 'slightly delayed'. The EH101 is now due to be operating in the second half of the decade. Westland foresees a potential world market for between 550 and 750 units. But anticipated Canadian orders and further UK purchases for troop transport have both been under question. Problems for western European and US helicopter companies are now accentuated by potential rivalry from the two ex-Soviet producers, Mil and Kazov, possibly with western partners. The number of competing producers has been reduced through the formal setting up of Eurocopter in January, bringing together the helicopter operations of France's Aerospatiale and Germany's MBB. The new company can lay claim to being the world's largest manufacturer of civil helicopters, but is still heavily dependent on the NH90 and Tiger military programmes. Closer links between Westland and Agusta could form a second European manufacturing 'pole'. The US continues with four manufacturers (excluding the very light sector), but this may not last.</p>

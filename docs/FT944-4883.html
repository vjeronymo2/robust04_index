			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Survey of Japanese Industry (2): Strong export markets have been crucial / A look at developments in the electronics industry After three years of battling against the debilitating effects of a sharply rising yen and anaemic economic activity at home, Japan's electronics companies are finally beginning to see a turn in their fortunes. In their latest results, many Japanese electronics companies, from consumer electronics makers to computer and semiconductor manufacturers, have been able to report a lift in first-term profits this year and have indicated expectations of a better year-end than they have seen for the past few years. Toshiba, the integrated electronics company, for example, saw operating income quadruple in the first half while Sharp, the consumer electronics company, managed to double its operating profits in the six months to September, 1994. There is no doubt that strong export markets, particularly in the US and other parts of Asia, have been crucial in helping electronics companies to reverse the tide of falling profits. The results season did provide evidence, too, that many Japanese electronics companies still command a leading edge in key technologies which has enabled them to take advantage of buoyant demand overseas and thereby improve their profits and future outlook. The Japanese dominance of the memory chip market, for example, contributed significantly to the better results electronics companies have reported so far this year. The growing sophistication of electronics equipment, from more powerful PCs and games machines to increasingly intelligent camcorders and communications tools, has boosted demand for memories and provided a bonanza for the leading Japanese manufacturers of dynamic random access memory chips. Likewise, the Japanese lead in liquid crystal display panels - in wide demand for lightweight, portable electronic tools - has contributed significantly to the recovery of many companies. Toshiba, for example, says that first-half sales were up 16 per cent in its information and devices division, which makes up 60 per cent of overall sales, while total exports were up 18 per cent, largely on the strength of semiconductor and LCD demand. Meanwhile, Japanese companies have been implementing crucial restructuring efforts, including the shifting of manufacturing overseas and increased procurement of components from abroad, to lower their cost base. Companies have been moving labour-intensive manufacturing to countries with lower labour costs, most notably China, and buying a larger number of components made in south-east Asia where prices are often 20 to 30 per cent below those at home. With the yen showing no signs of returning much of its recent 24 per cent gain against the US dollar, and as the domestic market promises no more than a mild recovery, such cost-cutting has been a vital element of Japanese companies' programmes to regain international competitiveness. The result has generally been a significant improvement in operating profits even while sales have hardly firmed or have even fallen. Matsushita, the world's largest consumer electronics group, reduced costs by Y28bn in the first half, and improved pre-tax profits by 26 per cent although sales were only moderately higher. Restructuring efforts have been essential not only in raising profits at Japanese electronics companies but also in maintaining their position against growing competition both in overseas markets and in their home market. The appreciation of the yen has meant that Japanese electronics makers are at a disadvantage against foreign competitors, not only in world markets, but in the domestic market as well. Consumer electronics makers, for example, have faced stiff competition at home from cheaper Asian imports. NEC, Japan's leading PC-maker has been forced to follow the lead of foreign computer makers in Japan by reducing prices substantially. So far, the strengths Japanese companies had built up in many sectors of the electronics industry, coupled with restructuring efforts over the past few years, have enabled most companies to stand up to the growing pressures they face. Some of them are even likely to emerge from the domestic recession and the high yen environment better equipped to compete on the international stage. However, the improvement in their business results masks the reality Japanese electronics companies face of increasing international competition in markets they have long dominated such as consumer electronics and memory chips, or where they have been able to enjoy a protected home market, such as in the domestic PC market. In semiconductors, for example, while the recent boom in memory chip demand has been a strong factor behind the profits rise at Japanese electronics companies, they are expected to face increasing competition from Korean manufacturers which have raised their competitiveness vis-a-vis Japanese manufacturers in recent years. Mr Yutaka Sugiyama, industry analyst at UBS Securities, notes that 'a sharp increase in Korean production is threatening the Japanese semiconductor industry.' Mr Sugiyama believes that as a result Japanese makers could see profitability decline as early as next year. Even in the PC market, while foreign competition has yet to break the domestic makers' grip on Japanese PC users in a significant way, cracks are beginning to appear, with one Japanese PC maker after another launching machines that are IBM-compatible, rather than based on their own proprietary systems. In wireless communications, which is one of the most promising growth markets, world-leading foreign companies such as Motorola and Nokia, are providing strong competition in the domestic market to Japanese equipment makers, which hardly have significant operations outside the home market. The likelihood is that, barring an unexpected plunge in the yen's value, and as Japan gradually opens its doors to more foreign products, Japanese electronics companies will continue to face strong foreign competition in many of their traditionally important markets. Their best hope then lies in their ability to continue identifying and developing technologies which will form the basis for new markets in the years ahead. So far, the signs are that many Japanese companies are well on the way to doing so. Sharp's belief in the continuing importance of information communication tools has led it to invest in the world's largest LCD plant and to focus R&amp;D efforts on opto-electronics, which enables the processing of information in huge volumes. Other Japanese companies such as Sony, see the information age spurring demand for advanced recording media. They have led in the development of discs which can record substantially larger amounts of information than currently possible. Their efforts are promising signs that as new markets based on new technologies unfold, Japanese electronics companies will continue to play a significant role in their development. As they do so, it is probably inevitable that many of the key product sectors they once dominated will be passed on to others.</p>

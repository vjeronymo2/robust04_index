			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Funds sought for new university LINCOLNSHIRE County Council plans to seek up to Pounds 30m of private-sector funding to establish a new university in Lincoln. The institution will be developed by either Nottingham University or Nottingham Polytechnic. Mr Arthur Ridings, the council's director of education, said that four consultancies had been asked to tender for a contract 'to identify potential commercial, industrial and community partners for the university initiative'. Both the university and the polytechnic have estimated that it would take Pounds 30m to establish the new university. The council wants the maximum possible private funding, but the consultants will also be expected to advise on the use of the money markets to make up any shortfall. The report is expected by the end of May, and the council will choose its academic partner by the end of July. The most likely approach is to transform one of the county's higher-education colleges into a university college and then to expand that into a university by the end of the decade.</p>

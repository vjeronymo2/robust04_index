			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Architecture: Let's start blowing things up - Colin Amery backs John Gummer's move on the man-made environment John Gummer, the UK environment secretary, last week launched a debate on how Britain's man-made environment can be improved. His speech to the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors was accompanied by a discussion document, in which he promised to demolish his own department's hideous three-towered, 1960s concrete office building in Marsham Street in Westminster. Is this the outward and physical sign of an inner conversion away from the horrors of modernism to the values of civilised architecture? Is Mr Gummer a latter day Pugin? We know he has converted to catholicism, but is he also poised to be as passionate and polemical as Pugin in the pursuit of quality? It is worth looking hard at the document because it bears the marks of the minister's own hand and, if that same hand succeeds in demolishing the 1960s horrors of Marsham Street, we have to take the minister seriously. In his preface to the consultation document he rightly says that architecture is the only art form that is inescapable. He also points out that it is not architecture alone that shapes our world but other important factors like air quality, noise, roads, open spaces, street furniture, trees and walls. But it is architecture and design that creates many of the visual boundaries of our world and there is a responsibility on all who build to improve the quality of that world. There is a strong moral tone in much of what is written in this document and it has a note of the new political correctness about it. The key words are 'quality' and 'sustainability' - both of them subjective and both of them hard to define and achieve. The miracle is to see any minister using these words at all, and Mr Gummer uses them with the pleasurable anticipation. He always reminds me of 'The Water Babies'. His philosophy is, 'do as you would be done by'. This minister eats the beef to prove there is no such thing as mad cow disease. This minister will demolish his own offices to encourage others to do the same. There are key points in this document which are hard to resist. The idea of sustainable mixed development is not just jargon - it does make sense to provide for local needs locally and to encourage a sense of local community by putting houses near jobs and making use of new technology to encourage home working and less time wasting travelling. The recent rail strikes in the UK have only helped to encourage people to find ways of working at home and have obviously had no effect on communication by fax or modem. It is no longer necessary to move people about so much, nor to build giant offices full of commuters. Mr Gummer is keen on revitalising town centres, although I notice he says nothing about excessive rents or the swingeing business rate. Small shops simply cannot afford to be in town centres - even in areas of central London there are hundreds of empty of shops. 'Nurturing vitality' is a much more subtle and complex process than Mr Gummer seems to realise. Why does his document appear to encourage more suburban development by its admission that it is hard to raise the quality of inner-city housing to the level of comfort of the suburbs? Planning, lack of traffic control, high rating and conservation rules still make it too difficult to build enough good inner-city houses. New urban villages - a charming idea - have a long way to go before they are much more than a pipe dream. In fact, there are plenty of older urban villages in existence already - they need the help and support of government improvement grants. If this government under Margaret Thatcher had not fallen in love with the illusion of London Docklands, London's infrastructure would not have suffered such a terrible decline and money would have been available to help communities in all the inner cities. The new urban regeneration agency, known as English Partnerships, has been given a responsibility to promote high standards of development and diminish the bureaucracy of planning. But does it really have any teeth? The object of the document is to encourage discussion about good design and it is an opportunity for FT readers to take part in the debate. Send for a copy of, 'Quality in Town and Country' from the Department of the Environment, Room C13/10a, 2, Marsham Street, London, SW1P 3EB, and complete the response form. Filling in the form and suggesting ideas for the minister to think about is this year's holiday task. You have until September 30 to reply. As a brief guide to help both responders and Mr Gummer, why not add a few suggestions to his demolition list. Why stop at the Department of the Environment? The tin sheds that litter the edges of almost every town to promote the worst aspects of DIY should all go. In the capital, that parody of an art gallery, the Hayward Gallery on the South Bank, should be blown up as should the Hilton Hotel, the Knightsbridge Barracks, the Home Office in Queen Anne's Gate and all other hotels and excrescences on the skyline that ruin the Royal Parks. They should all be selectively exploded. A particularly offensive example is the Royal Garden Hotel that blights the entrance to Kensington Palace. Most of Victoria Street should go and I suppose there is no hope of abandoning that pointless erection Canary Wharf and letting it become a picturesque ruin? As part of my own initiative to encourage quality in town and country, I am shortly setting up a school of creative vandalism - Mr Gummer is my first pupil.</p>

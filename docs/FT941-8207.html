			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Emerging Markets: Rough riding ahead in China - The Emerging Investor China's fledgling stock markets are set for another bumpy year while traders digest implications of a new tax law, a government credit squeeze limiting funds available for investment, and faltering attempts to conclude a new securities law. Judging by sharp fluctuations in the first seven weeks of the year of both the yuan-denominated A-share and dollar B-share indexes - they dived before recovering some lost ground - traders are jittery. Investors are likely to continue to be distracted by plans to float a new batch of Chinese companies on overseas stock exchanges, by talk of a third stock exchange by the end of the year, and by fears that China's credit crunch may herald the beginning of a recession. Other factors depressing share prices include improving bond yields and a rash of new issues. Twelve-month treasury bonds yielding 11.9 per cent are proving appealing to institutional and individual invest-ors. The new tax law is another factor dragging markets down since it leaves it unclear whether investors are liable for capital gains tax on top of charges on share transactions and tax on dividends. But if there is good news for Chinese investors and foreign institutions warily testing the markets, it lies in the apparent commitment of China's stock regulators to further economic liberalisation, and to stiffening regulatory procedures. Professor Li Yining, one of China's most influential economists and the head of a parliamentary committee drafting the new Securities Law, believes that additional steps to bolster public trust in capital markets are vital for market reforms. China's Securities Law is now in its seventh draft and Prof Li hopes that by the end of this year it will be implemented, although a number of contentious issues remain to be resolved. These include differences over the degree of self-regulation to be allowed to local exchanges; over whether over-the-counter trading will be permitted; and whether state shares (as opposed to those held by institutions and individuals) should be traded in the market. Some officials fear this will lead to the state losing control of state enterprises. Prof Li favours stronger central control over markets, but says that given powerful provincial interests it would be difficult for a body like the US Securities and Exchange Commission to emerge in China. He also believes that OTC trading should be permitted, since to outlaw it would only encourage a 'black market'. And, finally, he feels that 'state-owned shares' should be traded, otherwise 'they are dead'. Most importantly, however, Prof Li sees the development of China's equity markets as a means of facilitating a faltering process of corporatisation and privatisation. 'If we don't set up shareholding companies we will never be able to separate government and management,' he says. Among the authorities' most urgent tasks is the effort to 'corporatise'  - this is a Chinese half-way house to privatisation in which enterprises are detached from state control - or fully privatise elements of the faltering state sector. This involves dealing with the vexed property rights issue. Until the question of ownership of state assets is resolved, and therefore who should be responsible for disposing of such assets, the process of unravelling state control will prove difficult, if not impossible. Various creative solutions have been advanced, including channelling state assets into a special 'State Investment Corporation' which would be responsible for divestiture; the transfer of assets from the government itself to larger enterprises; or the establishment of provincial commissions which would also be entrusted with the task of selling off state assets. These solutions are believed to be reflected in one form or another in a draft law on 'Controlling State Assets' submitted recently to the State Council, or cabinet. This measure, together with a new Corporate Law due to come into effect in July, should go some way towards providing the legal basis for a rational process of divestiture. Prof Li himself favours a combination of the various approaches mentioned above together with full privatisation for smaller enterprises, and mixed state and private ownership for larger businesses along the lines of the French or Scandinavian models. Foreign legal experts believe that China is slowly moving towards having a 'pretty good' regulatory framework, although they criticise what they regard as an arbitrary approach by the Securities Regulatory Commission - the national securities watchdog - to selecting companies for overseas listing. They note that of the latest batch of 23 companies selected for listing abroad - six mainland companies listed in Hong Kong last year - there is a preponderance of power companies, including three from Shandong province alone. This suggests a less than rational approach in the selection process, and also reflects, no doubt, powerful lobbying at the centre. Premier Li Peng's family, for example, has long been connected with the power company, Huaneng International, which is among the candidates for foreign listings this year. In light of the squeeze on credit - the authorities have placed a ban on bank lending for new capital spending - pressures to be allowed to venture into international capital markets are certain to grow. China's evolving regulatory apparatus faces no easy task in a surging transitional economy undergoing a rapid and somewhat chaotic transformation to a market-oriented system.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      TEN BEST PERFORMING STOCKS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                         Friday     Week on week change Stock                       Country      close      Dollars     %  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Alarko Holding               Turkey     1.1206      0.4029    56.15 Arcelik                      Turkey     1.2691      0.4410    53.26 Eregli Demir Ve Celik        Turkey     0.2781      0.0960    52.67 Yapi Ve Kredi Bankasi        Turkey     0.2241      0.0751    50.36 Ege Biracilik                Turkey     4.3742      1.4209    48.11 Eczacibasi Ilac              Turkey     0.9991      0.3228    47.74 Eczacibasi Yatrim            Turkey     0.4266      0.1341    45.82 Koc Holding                  Turkey     2.1601      0.6696    44.93 Aygaz                        Turkey     0.5400      0.1647    43.86 Teletas                      Turkey     1.0936      0.3207    41.50  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Baring Securities  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

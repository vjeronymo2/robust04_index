			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE Mid Index in the limelight PRIVATE investors seized the initiative in the London stock market yesterday, leaving the big institutions to continue their cautious shuffling of portfolios ahead of this morning's expiry of the December stock index future. Active trading in the second line issues brought a gain of around 1 per cent in the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, while the FT-SE 100 Index (the Footsie) had to be content with a rise of barely 0.3 per cent on the day. The FT-SE Mid 250 closed 30 points stronger, but the FT-SE 100, after an erratic session, ended only 7.5 higher at 2,740.3. Trading volume increased sharply, with business in the second line stocks well outpacing that in the FT-SE 100 listed issues. Once again, the influence of the stock index future was clearly displayed in the stock market by a sharp upswing when the futures opened. But the stock market was impervious to the day's list of statistics on the domestic economy. A rise in November unemployment to an annual rate of 10.3 per cent, with the total at a 5 1/2 -year high, changed little in market perceptions, nor did the 5.5 per cent annualised gain in average earnings in October. Tax-related deals played a significant role in the blue chip stocks. After slipping by 7.4 on the Footsie in early trading, the market about-turned abruptly to record a net advance of more than 15 points at midsession. But the Footsie 2,750 level proved more than the market could manage and share prices in the market leaders then turned back to reduce the final rise on the FT-SE Index to 7.5 on the day. With several trading houses still predicting a Footsie 2,700 close for the year, securities dealers were cautious of being drawn into the market. Seaq-reported volume jumped to 825m shares from the 676.3m of the previous day, but on Wednesday retail, or customer, business was worth Pounds 1.25bn, indicating the weight of overnight tax-related business in blue chip stocks by institutions seeking to establish tax positions ahead of the calendar year-end. Views of the outlook for the UK stock market among the UK securities houses continued to range between those who warn that pre-Christmas trading sessions, when most of the institutions are no longer at full throttle, can be a misleading guide to underlying sentiment, and the optimists who have already pinned their faith in a further advance in the stock market next year. At the annual seminar held by Kleinwort Benson Securities yesterday, investors were told that the UK merchant bank is holding its forecast for the 1993 year-end to Footsie 3,000. While seeing the UK stock market as offering the best risk/reward prospect of leading global markets, Kleinwort has doubts over the likely pace of the recovery in UK corporate earnings next year, the uncertain outlook for domestic inflation, and finally over 'where the money is going to come from' for an advance in share prices. Among the brighter sectors yesterday, brewing shares stood out strongly as Guinness continued its recovery from the doubts over international earnings posed recently by UK brokers. GEC, traditionally seen as a defensive stock because of its cautious cash policies, came in for renewed investment support.</p>

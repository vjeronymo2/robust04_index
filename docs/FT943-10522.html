			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Equifax bid for UAPT challenged by Trans Union UAPT-Infolink, one of the UK's leading credit referencing companies, was yesterday caught in a bidding war between North America's two major credit assessment groups, with two consecutive offers for the group announced in one day. Equifax had announced a 500p recommended offer on July 26, and its offer document was due today. It was pre-empted by a rival 550p bid yesterday from Trans Union, another North American credit information business. Equifax responded by offering 600p. But despite UAPT board support for the 500p bid, the higher bid has not been recommended. A spokesman for UAPT said it had explained its reasons to Equifax, and the board will today consider its response to the new bid. The cash offers compare with a UAPT share price as low as 75p earlier this year, but reflect the value of UAPT's substantial consumer and business data base. Equifax already has a similar share of the UK consumer credit referencing market to UAPT's Infolink, but this is loss-making. It would be able to reduce costs and increase customers through a link-up with UAPT. Trans Union, which is a subsidiary of the Marmon Group and made an unaudited pre-tax profit of Dollars 65m (Pounds 42m) in 1993, has no experience of the UK market. It is looking to retain UAPT as an independent business, providing a toe hold in Europe. The assurance of independence is likely to appeal to UAPT's management, and the board unanimously recommended Trans Union's 550p offer, which values the company at Pounds 43m. The board has also secured irrevocable indications of support from shareholders representing 12.1 per cent of its shares. By comparison, the rationale behind the Equifax bid is to add value to the business through the merger of the two UK consumer credit businesses, which would inevitably mean job losses and substantial cost cutting. UAPT has suffered a substantial loss of market share in its core consumer credit business in recent years, primarily to CCN Systems, a subsidiary of Great Universal Stores, which has built up an estimated 60 per cent market share.</p>

			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Italians chase a futures fast track - Plans for introducing a derivatives market HAVING successfully revived its government bond market with a screen-based trading system in 1988, Italy's regulators are now trying to do the same with futures. According to the Italian Treasury, a new domestic market for government bond futures should be ready by July. If it opens in time, the Italians will justly be able to claim to have created one of the world's fastest-developed derivatives markets. A first hurdle will come at next week's annual meeting of the roughly 300 participants in the existing cash market, who will decide whether to back the new venture. Regulators, Treasury officials and a sprinkling of bankers are now pressing ahead with finalising the rules for the new project. Turnover in the cash market for Italian government securities has soared since the arrival of screen-based trading, which bolstered liquidity just as international investors began to turn to Italian bonds on account of their relatively high interest rates at a time of limited exchange rate risk under the European Monetary System. The growing appeal of Italian bonds was enough to persuade two derivatives markets, the London International Financial Futures Exchange (Liffe) and the Matif, the Paris-based exchange, to launch futures contracts on Italian bonds last year. Trading at Matif has dwindled, but Liffe's Italian bond future has become one of its fastest-growing products, with more than 800,000 contracts changing hands since last September's launch. The Liffe contract, now supplemented by an option, 'has filled the gap in the market for a suitable hedging instrument on Italian government paper,' says one dealer. The Italian authorities, headed by the Treasury and the Bank of Italy, now want to repeat Liffe's success at home. Officials argue that as the cash market for government paper is based in Italy, domestic demand for futures should be strong, too. Chauvinism has sometimes fuelled the calls for a domestic venture. But most bankers would balk at the idea of creating a new exchange in little more than a year. Even European neighbours like Switzerland and Germany, which set up derivatives markets in the late 1980s, found their projects much more time-consuming than expected. However, the Italian approach to the problem differs markedly from most others. Rather than creating a large public exchange from scratch, futures trading in Italy is to be an adjunct of the existing screen-based cash market. That should allow Italian banks to avoid some of the work required in Switzerland and Germany. The Italians' venture will be based on the technology already used for cash bond trading. By embarking on a less ambitious project from the start it may be possible to get going more quickly. The timing will be accelerated by the decision to use foreign specialists on two crucial elements of the new venture. Software for futures trading is being developed by STM, a Canadian specialist which wrote the software for the existing cash market in bonds. And ICCH Financial Markets, part of the UK-based clearing group, will supply software for clearing. Meanwhile, the Italian authorities have been free to concentrate on legal and regulatory points. A ministerial decree in mid-February set out the legal framework for the new market, which resembles that already in use for the cash market. Working groups are now drawing up rules for operating and trading bond futures, along with precise definitions for the clearing house which will be set up alongside the futures market. It is already clear that the clearing house will be a joint stock company, in which all but one of the 25 existing 'primary dealers' will probably be the initial shareholders. The exception, JP Morgan, may be prevented from taking a stake on account of US regulatory requirements. The capital for the clearing house is likely to start at around L50bn, rising to about double that once the system is functioning. There will be various categories of membership; the two most important being 'general' members, which will need to have around L100bn in capital and will be allowed to clear for themselves and third parties; and 'individual' members, with a capital requirement of around L20bn, which will be authorised to clear only their own contracts and those of clients. Next week's meeting of the participants in the screen-based cash market should provide the first indication of how many banks and brokers want to trade futures. Under last year's reform of Italy's securities markets, at least 30 participants are needed, five of them market-makers, for the project to go ahead. Bankers doubt there will be any problem raising the requisite numbers. 'Many already want to take part from now,' says one expert involved in the discussions. The Italian Bankers' Association, which is also involved in the project, is thought to have received at least 100 expressions of strong interest. But, for the new market to open on time, progress must still be made on certain key points. Those include drawing up contract specifications and overcoming technological problems in making sure the software for trading and clearing futures works on the cash market's existing system. Discussions on contract specification, are 'at an advanced stage of reflection', says one official. It is widely expected that first contract will involve a notional 10-year bond, similar to that on Liffe. However, no details have been released as to contract size or the range of bonds suitable for delivery. 'Decisions on which bonds can be delivered will be taken very close to the starting date of the project,' says one expert. So far, the plans appear to be on schedule. Preparation of the software is believed to be going well. The risk of delays on the clearing side is limited by the fact that the new market is taking on software already in use in Belgium and at a number of exchanges in Japan, according to ICCH. However, with so much of the debate taking place behind closed doors, precise progress is hard to judge. Some bankers involved warn of slippage because of possible technical hitches when it comes to running the new software on the existing system. 'Creating the right interfaces could still take time,' says one consultant. There is also some unease that precise rules for the clearing house are still not ready, despite original hopes to have matters settled and the operation established by the end of last year. 'There are still a lot of loose ends,' says one banker. Although the project is being co-ordinated by the Bank of Italy, some participants also fear the timetable could slip owing to the fact that responsibilities are divided between a number of regulatory and trade agencies, with no single organisation cracking the whip. 'These processes need to be managed. If they're not managed, they tend to get derailed,' says one specialist with experience of setting up new futures and options markets. 'So far, there is no reason to expect delays,' says an official from the bankers' association. He points out that the first training courses for dealers are due to begin later this month. With the new venture scheduled to start in mid-year, that is barely a moment too soon.</p>

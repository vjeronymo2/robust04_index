			<p><P> April 10, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PERFORMING ARTS CENTER TO OFFER MODERN DANCE PROGRAMS;  </P> <P> NEW SEASON: THE APPEARANCE BY THE MARTHA GRAHAM DANCE COMPANY OF NEW YORK WILL  BE A FIRST FOR THE CENTER, WHICH IS EXPLORING THE EXTENT OF INTEREST HERE IN  THE GENRE.  </P> <P> In a departure from its past emphasis on ballet, the Orange County Performing  Arts Center will for the first time present a modern dance troupe, Center  officials said Monday in announcing their 1990-91 dance season.  </P> <P> The Martha Graham Dance Company of New York will make its only Southern  California appearances Jan. 4-6, 1991, at the Center. The Graham company  programs will be offered in addition to a subscription package of three ballet  companies that includes the previously reported engagements of the Australian  Ballet Aug. 7-12; and the New York City Ballet, Sept. 25-30, 1990, in its first  return engagement at the Center since 1986. Rounding out the season will be the  fifth appearance at to the Center by the American Ballet Theatre, March 12-24,  1991.  </P> <P> The Graham dates represent an experiment for the Center, and they will be  offered as an option for ballet subscribers.  </P> <P> "We will find out what interest there is for modern dance" in Orange County,  Center President Thomas R. Kendrick said Monday. "If the Graham experience is  good, I think there are certain other companies that we might be able to  handle" as options for ballet subscribers.  </P> <P> Noticeably absent from the list is the Joffrey Ballet, which has been part of  the Center's ballet series three times over the past three years.  </P> <P> "We have said from the very beginning that we are not committed to any one  company on an annual basis," Kendrick said. "Our goal is to provide a range of  companies over a period of time."  </P> <P> Kendrick said the decision not to bring the Joffrey next season was "absolutely  not" related to the collapse of negotiations between ABT and the Los Angeles  Music Center Operating Company in December, something that ABT Executive  Director Jane Hermann attributed to the Joffrey's residency at the Music  Center. (Officials at the Music Center, however, denied Hermann's charge.)  </P> <P> "We have had (the Joffrey) several times and anticipate having them again," he  said.  </P> <P> Graham will be represented by two programs of mixed repertory: One will include  her classic "Appalachian Spring," set to Copland's score, and the other, her  "Errand Into the Maze."  </P> <P> For its exclusive West Coast engagement, the New York Ballet will lean heavily  upon repertory by founding artistic director George Balanchine. "La Source,"  "Stars and Stripes," "Four Temperaments" and the infrequently toured "Vienna  Waltzes" will be among the works danced.  </P> <P> The run by American Ballet Theatre will be split between mixed repertory (to be  announced) and either Natalia Makarova's staging of "La Bayadere" or a new  production of "Coppelia."  </P> <P> As previously reported, the Australian Ballet will dance "Giselle," Lichine's  "Graduation Ball," Lifar's "Suite en Blanc" and others to be announced by  Australian and New Zealand choreographers.  </P> <P> Prices for subscription tickets will range from $57 to $190; they will include  four events -- one each by the Australian and New York City ballets, and two  performances by ABT. Tickets for the Graham programs will be offered as an  option for subscribers.  </P> <P> Subscription tickets will go on sale May 20. Tickets for individual programs  will go on sale about six weeks before each engagement. Information is  available at (714) 556-2787.  </P> <P> The season:  </P> <P> * Aug. 7-12: Australian Ballet: Maina Gielgud's staging of "Giselle,"  "Graduation Ball" (Johann Strauss); Lifar's "Suite en Blanc" (Lalo); other  works to be announced.  </P> <P> * Sept. 25-30: New York City Ballet: Balanchine's "Vienna Waltzes" (music by  Lehar, Johann and Richard Strauss); "Stars and Stripes" (Sousa), "Four  Temperaments" (Hindemith), "Tchaikovsky's Suite No. 3," "Concerto Barocco"  (Bach); "La Source" (Delibes); "Chaconne" (Gluck); Jerome Robbins' "Dances at a  Gathering" (Chopin); and Peter Martins' "Ecstatic Orange" (Michael Torke).

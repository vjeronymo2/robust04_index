			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Fed signals US rate rise to 3.5%: Bond prices advance after move to curb rate of growth and increase in inflation The Federal Reserve yesterday moved to slow the rate of US economic growth by signalling a modest increase in short-term interest rates to 3.5 per cent. Bond and share prices rose following the announcement, which came during a jittery day on Wall Street as traders waited anxiously for a decision on rates from the Fed's policy-making open market committee which met yesterday in Washington. After the meeting, Mr Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, issued a short statement saying the committee had decided 'to increase slightly the degree of pressure on reserve positions. This action is expected to be associated with a small increase in short-term money market rates'. Analysts interpreted this as a sign that the new target for the federal funds rate - the cost of overnight money for banks - would be raised to 3.5 per cent. The Fed's move was in line with market expectations and followed a quarter-point increase in the Fed funds rate to 3.25 per cent on February 4. The February rate increase was the first in five years and led to a sharp increase in long bond yields to nearly 7 per cent because analysts interpreted it as the first in a series of tightening moves. Speculation that the Fed would tighten policy again reached fever pitch last Friday after President Bill Clinton called Mr Greenspan to the White House for a discussion of economic trends. The White House, which believes there is little risk of higher inflation, said it had not tried to influence the Fed's decision. The US Treasury yesterday reiterated its support for Fed independence and said it shared the Fed's goal of achieving sustainable growth and low inflation. By signalling a further rates rise, the Fed evidently hoped to calm nerves in bond markets by showing that it was serious about preventing the economy overheating and thus averting a rise in inflation next year or in 1996. Most analysts expect the Fed to continue to raise rates until they reach a 'neutral' level perceived to be at least 4 to 5 per cent. The speed of tightening, however, is likely to depend on the rate of economic growth later this year and the extent of upward pressure on inflation. After weeks of anticipation, bond traders appeared relieved that the long-awaited boost in the fed funds target rate had finally taken place. The benchmark 30-year government bond, which is especially sensitive to inflationary expectations, showed the biggest gains, in sharp contrast to February 4, when the Fed's first strike on rates triggered an immediate sell-off. The long bond jumped by 1 5/32 to 92 13/32 . The yield eased to 6.848 per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 2.3 points at 3,862.55, after a burst of buying immediately after Mr Greenspan's statement. The news came too late to affect European bond markets, but could cause further volatility today. 'The US has been hanging like a black cloud over European bond markets for the last two months, and there is no reason why that should stop,' said Mr Andrew Roberts of UBS. However, according to one market observer, 'if (the US rise) is accompanied by a significant cut in the German repo rate, this could reinforce hopes for a clearer divergence between Europe and the US'. The Bundesbank is today due to allocate two-week securities repurchase agreements at variable rates. Many traders expect the lowest-accepted repo rate to fall by around 8 basis points from last week's 5.88 per cent. However, the move may weaken hopes of an imminent rate cut in the UK, which has followed the pick-up in the US economy, ahead of the rest of Europe. Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International, said the Fed's announcement confirmed that 'Greenspan is still in a gradualist mode'.

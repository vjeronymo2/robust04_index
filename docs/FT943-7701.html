			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Check-off wins companies' support The check-off system for paying union subscriptions directly from pay packets helps in 'promoting good industrial relations', say 53 per cent of companies in an Institute of Manpower Studies study. Only 5 per cent see the strengthening of trade union organisation in their company as a disadvantage, while the costs of its administration are not seen as a problem. The survey, published today, shows that the legislation introduced last year requiring trade unions to seek approval from their members every three years for check-off will have only a 'modest' impact on existing arrangements. Only six cases were found of companies withdrawing from check-off and none were due to the rule changes. Check-off is seen as important by companies for efficiency and co-operation in industrial relations. A number of trade unions believe they have secured new members as a result of the legislation and their subsequent campaigns to secure membership approval, although others are concerned that they will lose members. After September 1 a union member will be able to take legal action against their employer if the subscription continues to be paid without their approval. Both the GMB general union and the MSF technical union are claiming new members and a net gain in their total membership, although many unions have expressed concern that they will suffer a net membership loss.</p>

			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Brazilian tax on cheques approved THE Brazilian government was yesterday savouring the first victory for its new economic plan, having won congressional approval for a new tax on cheques. The tax is a crucial part of the 'Real Plan' announced last week aimed at plugging the Dollars 12bn (Pounds 8bn) public deficit. The government estimates that the 0.25 per cent levy on all financial transactions will bring in an extra Dollars 600m a month in revenue. Fearful that it would not pass, the government had mobilised the entire cabinet to lobby deputies and approved the liberation of funds for the pet projects of various state governors, such as the Braslia metro and the Red Line highway in Rio. But after repeated failures at securing a quorum last week, the tax was approved easily on Tuesday night, with 308 votes in favour and just 87 against. The real triumph was for new finance minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who has been talking with politicians day and night since announcing the plan, which requires Congress to approve 13 projects and decrees. Mr Genebaldo Correia, leader of the PMDB, Brazil's largest party, yesterday described the approval of the tax as 'a vote of confidence in Fernando Henrique and his plan'. In a further boost to Mr Cardoso, a group of musicians and intellectuals will fly to Brasila today to offer their support for the plan as part of the 'Decola Brasil' or 'Take Off Brazil' movement. The tax must now be approved by the Senate, where the government has a comfortable majority. Mr Cardoso hopes to implement it in August to earn an extra Dollars 3bn this year. However, the victory may prove more of a political than a fiscal success, as Brazil's creative banking sector is busily working out ways around the unpopular tax. The business community complains it is already overtaxed and what is really needed is a crackdown on evasion. Mr Joseph Couri, a leading Sao Paulo businessman, says: 'This is a recessive and inflationary tax transferring money from the productive to unproductive sectors.'</p>

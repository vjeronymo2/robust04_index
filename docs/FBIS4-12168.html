			<p>BFN     [Text] New Delhi, April 1, (IRNA) -- The developed world,  led by the United States is beginning to realize the possibility  of losing its long-standing competitivenss in economy.    The economic regeneration taking place in the developing  world, specially in Asia is giving the West a bit of its own  medicine. Their products have been overselling the West's,  thanks to their competitiveness.    Western economies under the spell of a major recession, have  been attempting to look outward for enhanced trade to narrow  their trade deficit.    Consequently, a great deal of effort was put into resolving  the stalemate that Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade (GATT) had come to. But while they wanted to  pry foreign markets open, they were anxious also to insulate  their own economies from the growing competition that newly  industrialised countries were giving them.    A policy of "managed trade" was resorted to. It was  throughly discredited as was witnessed in the case of US-Japan  trade talk. The American demand for quantitative targets for  imports by Japan backfired.    A more subtle tool is being used now. Developed economies  today are busy laying the ideological foundation for "social",  non-tariff barriers to trade.    As more and more developing economies modernise,  industrialise, and compete in a wide range of markets with the  developed indusrtrial economies, two centuries of inter-country  comparative advantages are going haywire. This turning of the  table on the developed world, is only in part due to the lower  wages in developing world.    But the West has made "labour welfare", its major plank for  criticism.    The Uruguay Round of GATT is to be formally adopted in  Morocco by the end of April this year. Although the Dunkel  proposals for resolving the deadlocked was approved by all  members, the US supported by such countries as France has made  it known that, the social clause would be legal ground enough to  ban import of products from the developing economies.    The US has contended that low wages in the developed world  gives an artificial advantage to their products which amounts to  "social dumping" in the developed world.    This move is extremely distressing. The G-7, especially the  US and the European Union are pushing developing countries to  see how far they will go in accomodating the former's  protectionist moves. The inclusion of environmental  protectionism, "green barriers to trade" and the threat of  countering "social dumping" by banning products produced by  cheap labour are the latest weapons in their arsenals.    But all these aim at undoing the gains of the Uruguay Round.    Such attempts by the West are not new. For over two years  Western governments have been linking political, especailly  human rights and environmental issues to economic relations with  the developing economies.    Developing world leaders have reacted sharply to the above  moves. Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao made a hard-hitting  speech at the G-15 summit in New Delhi against the unilateral  interpretation of some of the provisions of the GATT against the  interests of the developing countries.    He cautioned the advanced economies against putting up  artificial barriers to free trade.    The Malaysian prime minister, Mahatir Mohammad, speaking in  a  similar vein criticised the West for resorting to measures  detrimental to the interests of the developing countries. He  urged all developing countries to come together to oppose the  "social clause".    It is in this context that the final agreement in April on  GATT, will be taken.</p>

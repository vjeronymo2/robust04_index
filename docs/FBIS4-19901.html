			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara--The eighth Turkey-Iran joint security  committee meeting is set to begin today in Tehran. Interior  Ministry Deputy Undersecretary Muharrem Goktayoglu is to chair  the Turkish delegation attending the meeting.    Decisions reached in previous security meetings and  activities of the subcommittees will be among the topics to be  discussed during the three-day meeting. The committee will also  work on developing new policies to be implemented in the future.  The joint security committee was established by a security  agreement signed in 1992 in Tehran. According to this  agreement, Iran has been handing over to Turkey members of the  outlawed Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK).    The security agreement foresees a type of cooperation  between  Turkey and Iran that would lead the two sides to hand over  individuals who are suspected of acting against the other  country.    Within the framework of this agreement, joint security  committees and subcommittees hold periodic meetings to discuss  the latest developments in field of security.</p>

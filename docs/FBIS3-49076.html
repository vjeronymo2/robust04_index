			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Mile Akmadzic, minister for interrepublican </F> and international relations for the Croatian republic of  Herceg-Bosna and former prime minister of Bosnia-Herzegovina, by  Ante Suljak; place and date not given: "Boban Is President, I  Remain Minister...."]    [Text] [Suljak] Mr. Akmadzic, you and Hrvoje Sarinic, head  of the [Croatian] president's National Security Council,  recently attended talks with the Serbian side in Belgrade. What  did you discuss?    [Akmadzic] It is correct that Mr. Hrvoje Sarinic and I  visited Belgrade at the initiative of the cochairmen of the  peace conference, Owen and Stoltenberg. In Belgrade, we held  talks with Serbian representatives, the leaders of Serbs from  Bosnia-Herzegovina, Radovan Karadzic, Momcilo Krajisnik, and  Nikola Koljevic. The talks were also attended by the  representatives of Serbia, Slobodan Milosevic and Foreign  Minister Vladislav Jovanovic. The talks were also attended by  some other important persons, the cochairmen of the peace  conference, and some members of their expert teams.    All issues that burden Croatian-Serbian relations in  Bosnia-Herzegovina were discussed, such as the issue of  delineation. We also discussed how to jointly approach the  issue of concessions, the issue of making concessions, or, as  this is referred to in the negotiations, territorial concessions  for the Muslim Republic in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In this regard,  the Serbian side was more obliged to make territorial  concessions, while the Croatian side was obliged to consider  concessions regarding an access to the sea. The talks, all  aspects of the talks, so to speak, focused on these issues. The  result of the talks was, we can call it, the joint proposal in  Geneva made with the cochairmen for settling this issue, which  was unfortunately not fully concluded and agreed on at the end.  However, joint principles were established as to how to make  concessions to the Muslim Republic in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    [Suljak] Could you tell us, without giving us a hard  diplomatic answer, whether you returned from Belgrade satisfied?    [Akmadzic] No, I, personally, did not return satisfied from  Belgrade. I must immediately stress that from Belgrade we went  to Vienna where we held talks with Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime  Minister Silajdzic and his aides. The talks that were held  there focused on virtually the same topics and problems. These  talks represent bilateral contacts, which, if I may say so, have  been going on continuously between the negotiating rounds in  Geneva and Brussels. We were not satisfied. I repeat, I  personally was not satisfied. I am not satisfied because the  Geneva-Brussels talks were again adjourned, because they ended  without a final settlement.    I would like to use this opportunity to say that, apart from  these talks, other continuous contacts between the Serbian and  the Muslim sides are also maintained in Sarajevo, at the local  airport. Therefore, what should be emphasized is that contacts  among the three sides are being maintained all the time. The  negotiations in Geneva happen periodically, after these  contacts. Such contacts will continue to be maintained. I am  not saying that the Belgrade meeting will be repeated, but  contacts aimed at finding a lasting solution, establishing a  cease-fire, and ending all hostilities will be maintained.  <H5>  Joint Solution </H5>   [Suljak] Did the Serbian and the Muslim sides demand from  the Croatian side at these talks in Vienna and Belgrade anything  else that the public does not know? Were there any new,  additional demands at the expense of the Croatian side?    [Akmadzic] No, one cannot talk about something being  demanded at the expense of someone else. I can say that all  these talks were held in a good atmosphere. However, no one is  demanding anything at the expense of someone else. We were  trying to find a joint solution. Of course, every side is  trying to get the best possible deal, which none of the three  sides found very easy anyway.    [Suljak] How is it that you accompanied Hrvoje Sarinic and  not, for instance, Mate Boban, especially in view of the fact  that Radovan Karadzic represented the other side?    [Akmadzic] I was in the Croatian side because I am a Croat,  if you want to know on whose side I am.  <H5>  Without a Compromise </H5>   [Suljak] No, we know that, but why was Mr. Boban not present  at these talks?    [Akmadzic] I was chosen to go there, in agreement with Mr.  Boban. Therefore, there was nothing unusual in this, except  what was agreed. When the Croatian republic of Herzeg-Bosna was  founded, the need arose for the involvement of as many people  from different positions as possible.    [Suljak] What is your comment on the increasingly frequent  reports in some Croatian and foreign media on the replacement of  Mate Boban, especially the articles that are already promoting  you as the next top man in the Croatian republic of Herzeg-Bosna.    [Akmadzic] I will not give you a diplomatic answer, but will  be sincere, I have not been reading newspapers recently. I am  very busy. I would not want to comment on this. Mr. Mate Boban  is president of the Croatian republic of Herzeg-Bosna and  president of HDZ [Croatian Democratic Community]. These are his  posts and this is what he is. I am minister for  inter-republican and international cooperation. My job is also  to act as a coordinator, so to speak, between the Croatian and  Muslims sides and reestablish trust. I also perform certain  jobs in the political body for relations between the Croats from  Herzegovina and the Croats from Bosnia, that is, the political  representative body in the future union of Bosnia-Herzegovina  republics. I have too many jobs and I have no time to think  about anything else.    [Suljak] So, no one approached you recently with the  proposal to perform the duties of the top man of the Croatian  republic of Herceg-Bosna in the future?    [Akmadzic] I have already told you, Mr. Mate Boban is  president of the Croatian republic of Herceg-Bosna.</p>

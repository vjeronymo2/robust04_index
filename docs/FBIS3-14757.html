			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Comments by Volodymyr Malynkovych, political expert; </F> Mykhaylo Horyn, leader of the Ukrainian Republican Party; and  Oleksandr Moroz, chairman of the Socialist Party of Ukraine  Political Council, on the decision of Ukrainian President Leonid  Kravchuk not to run for president; place and date not given]    [Text] [Volodymyr Malynkovych] Leonid Kravchuk is  apparently very tired.    The situation in the country is catastrophic, and he  understands that if nothing changes it will even deteriorate.  Additionally, his ratings have been declining recently.    He would most probably lose the elections. To resign means  to at least save face. I believe that his decision is serious.    [Mykhaylo Horyn] Leonid Kravchuk understands that a new  stage of the building of the Ukrainian state has begun, which  requires that definitely new tactics be worked out. A new  president is needed for new tactics.    [Oleksandr Moroz] Leonid Makarovych [Kravchuk] has not yet  officially announced that he will not run for president. If he  decides to do so, this will be a politically correct act. The  popularity of Leonid Kravchuk is decreasing. He and [Supreme  Soviet Chairman] Ivan Plyushch are responsible for the failures  of the Supreme Council. The refusal to participate in the  elections is a political defeat, but participation in the  elections would be an even bigger one for him, because he does  not have any chances.</p>

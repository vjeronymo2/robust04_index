			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / People: Midland casualty returns to consultancy American Gene Lockhart, who used to be Britain's highest paid banker, hasn't taken long to find a new job. The former chief executive of Midland Bank's UK banking operations has returned to his old firm, New York's First Manhattan Consulting Group. The 42-year-old Lockhart, who was thrown out of work after the Hong Kong takeover of Midland in July, says that he 'had four or five offers' to run US banks. However, he decided to go back into consultancy so that he could make some 'real money'. He has been appointed president of First Manhattan Consulting International. First Manhattan, which specialises in advising financial services companies, is not represented in London but Lockhart plans to rectify this and says that he expects to spend between a third and a half of his time in the UK. Although Midland Bank's problems before the takeover have received considerable attention, Lockhart is generally reckoned to have done a good job in turning round the UK banking business. When he joined Midland in 1987 as head of its group operations he was the first foreigner to be made an executive director of a UK clearing bank. During the two years he headed Midland's UK banking business, he increased operating profits by over 70 per cent, reversing a five-year decline. He reduced the workforce by 15 per cent, increased net interest margins by 30 per cent and introduced a number of innovations such as Firstdirect telephone banking service which attracted over 200,000 new customers from other banks. Although some comment-ators have questioned whether Midland's standards of service suffered during Lockhart's brief regime, he describes his time there as 'very successful' and plans to apply the lessons learnt to other banks. Meanwhile, there is no news yet of what Dutchman George Loudon, the former chief executive of Midland Montagu and the other high profile casualty of the Midland takeover, is doing. Before joining Midland, Loudon had held senior positions with McKinsey &amp; Co and Amro Bank.</p>

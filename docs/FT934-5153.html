			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Infrastructure projects As has become the custom for Tory chancellors at budget time, Mr Kenneth Clarke mouthed worthy words about private sector investment in public infrastructure projects. A vision of gleaming new privately-financed hospitals and motorways funded by electronic charges briefly shimmered on the horizon. This will only cause pained laughter among those companies which have fruitlessly bashed their heads against the Treasury's conceptual walls. But Mr Clarke promises to be more pragmatic than his predecessors. His admission of the need for a complete change of culture within government is refreshingly candid. The private finance working group headed by Sir Alastair Morton is a more tangible sign of intent. The approval of three transport projects is a further encouraging, if modest, development. Yet the best reason to believe Mr Clarke is that he has no choice. Large-scale infrastructure spending is a political necessity which the state can no longer afford. This may hold out tempting opportunities for the construction sector longer term. But its immediate worry is there will be a hiatus in activity while the practical difficulties are resolved. Both social housing spending and the roads programme have been cut - though by less than the stock market feared. It will take years for private sector infrastructure spending to take up the capacity slack and become a meaningful source of profits.</p>

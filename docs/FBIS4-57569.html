			<p>BFN     [Text] Montevideo, 19 May (EFE) -- Uruguayan Foreign  Minister Sergio Abreu today denied that his country will  participate in an eventual American force that will take action  in Haiti, and he ratified that his country does not support an  armed intervention in that Caribbean country.    Abreu made his country's position known after some foreign  media asserted that only Argentina and Uruguay were willing to  participate in a multinational force in Haiti.    The U.S. State Department asked the opinion of several OAS  member countries on the creation of a multinational force to  dislodge the military in power in Haiti.    The majority of Latin American countries opposes this idea,  which is one of three being studied in Washington. The other  ideas include direct intervention by the United States and the  creation of a force made up of Haitian refugees.    Uruguay has promoted political actions in the OAS in order  to  prevent the Haitian crisis from turning into a military solution.    Abreu stated that the country's position has not changed and  it will work with "preventive diplomacy."    The foreign minister said Uruguay "is a jealous defender of  nonintervention and the self-determination of nations."    "Uruguay will support all solutions that come within the  framework of international law and the responsible  organizations," Abreu reiterated. "The principles of  nonintervention and self-determination are not negotiable," he  stressed.</p>

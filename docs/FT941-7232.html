			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Survey of Asia-Pacific Telecommunications (3): Hub of south-east Asia - Singapore The modern story of Singapore telecommunications revolves round Singapore Telecom (ST), the island republic's telecommunications and post utility. ST has an exclusive licence to provide local and international telecommunications for Singapore until 2007 and a similar licence governing mobile communications services running until 1997. Partially privatised in October last year, ST is Singapore's biggest listed company with a market capitalisation of more than SDollars 50bn (Dollars 32bn) - about 20 per cent of the local market's total capitalisation. But in spite of its size and its monopoly position in Singapore, ST has earned a reputation as an efficient and progressive telecommunications facility. With about 40 lines per 100 people, Singapore has one of the highest telephone penetration ratios in the east Asia region. Singapore has become the telecommunications hub of south-east Asia. ST is now determined to become not only a regional but a world participant in the industry. To date, ST has concentrated its efforts on the home market, putting in place a wide range of services using state of the art technology. In 1989, Singapore became the first country in the world to install a nationwide ISDN network. With more than 50,000km of optical fibre cables installed throughout the island, Singapore now has one of the highest urban concentrations of optical fibre cable in the world. Through its control of what the government refers to as 'basic services' ST is the sole provider of fixed line national and international calls, public cellular services, radio paging and, through a subsidiary company, mail services. But notwithstanding these advantages, ST has remained competitive and has matured into a company capable of posing a challenge to much bigger global participants. In 1994, ST expects to spend SDollars 650m on improving its services and installing the latest technology. Over the next five years ST says it will be investing SDollars 3.7bn - big projects include the extension of submarine cable networks and a new satellite earth station to supplement two existing stations. Despite such expenditures, ST boasts some of the lowest domestic and international call charges in the region. It also has a range of services the envy of many bigger telecommunications companies. In 1990, ST launched what was the world's most advanced photo-video-text system through which photographic quality images are transmitted via TV. Users have access to a total of 130,000 teleview pages of government, business and other other information. Among other items users can pay bills, order goods and services, check banks accounts, monitor stock prices, take part in school lessons - even calculate income tax - through the system. In the five years to March 31 1993 the number of international calls grew at a rate of 18.7 per cent per year and the international sector now contributes about 50 per cent of ST's revenues. Most analysts expect such growth to be sustained in the medium term due to the continued growth in the economy of Singapore and other countries in the region. Cellular services are the main growth area at present - four in every 100 of Singapore's population now has a mobile phone. The emphasis now is on developing international operations. Through its subsidiary, Singapore Telecom International, ST has been aggressively expanding overseas, searching out joint ventures with a wide variety of companies. Until last October ST had invested nearly SDollars 500m in its overseas operations. These include the provision of cable services in Britain, the supply of data services in Thailand, cellular services in Vietnam, Sri Lanka and the Philippines and paging services in Indonesia and Hong Kong.</p>

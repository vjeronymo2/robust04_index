			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: WILSON QUITS AS DISNEY CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER  </P> <P> Gary L. Wilson has stepped aside as chief financial officer of Walt Disney Co.  but remains with the company as an adviser.  </P> <P> Wilson has been a key player on the senior management team that took over  Disney in September, 1984, after the entertainment giant fought off two  takeover attempts. He has been credited with helping to engineer the financing  that has allowed Disney to grow at a rapid pace during the past five years.  </P> <P> The announcement of the management change contributed to a sharp fall in  Disney's already weak stock. Disney, one of the most active issues on the New  York Stock Exchange Wednesday, fell $4.50 to $109.25 a share. The stock traded  as high as $136.25 earlier this year, when it was buoyed by takeover  speculation.  </P> <P> Industry analysts called the stock fall an overreaction.  </P> <P> "I still think the company will have a tremendous growth story over the next  couple of years," said Andrew Wallach, an entertainment analyst with Drexel  Burnham Lambert Inc.  </P> <P> Judson Green, who has been chief financial officer of Euro Disneyland SCA,  succeeds Wilson as Disney's chief financial officer. Lawrence P. Murphy, senior  vice president-strategy and development, will also assume some of Wilson's  operating responsibilities.  </P> <P> Wilson, who has signed a five-year contract with Disney, said he would continue  to be involved with planning Disney's future.  </P> <P> "This has kind of been evolving over the past year or so," Wilson said in a  telephone interview from Colorado, where he was on a skiing vacation with  Disney Chairman Michael D. Eisner.  </P> <P> "I will continue to be very focused on the strategic and financial side," he  said. "The younger guys will have a chance to operate." Wilson will turn 50  next month.  </P> <P> He said he would focus on seeking out major acquisitions. "We've done a lot of  technical acquisitions that have been very good for the company," he said. "But  we haven't done any major acquisitions, which I would consider over $1 billion,  because the prices have been too high."  </P> <P> Wilson said he expected acquisition prices to fall in the coming decade but  declined to detail what areas are drawing Disney's attention.  </P> <P> Disney operates theme parks, makes movies and recently formed a new independent  record label, Hollywood Records.  </P></p>

			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / International Company News: Write-downs due at Foster's FOSTER'S Brewing Group, the diversified Australian beer producer, has confirmed market speculation that it will announce major asset write-downs in its next annual earnings statement, due next month. The company was replying yesterday to the Australian Stock Exchange which was seeking reasons for recent heavy falls in its share price. Foster's directors referred to a statement in June which indicated that the carrying value of assets was being continually evaluated and further adjustments may be necessary. 'It is expected that this evaluation will be completed in time for the preliminary final statement,' they said. 'As a result of the continuing recession and deterioration of property prices, it is likely that material reductions in the carrying value of those assets will result.' Directors declined to make a direct comment on speculation that the company may require a share issue to top up its capital after any write-downs.</p>

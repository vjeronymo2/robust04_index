			<p>BFN     [Text] The PLO and Israeli delegations will continue the  discussions until an agreement is signed between the two  parties. Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres will leave for Cairo  tomorrow to meet with Egyptian President Husni Mubarak, PLO  Chairman Yasir 'Arafat, and U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher. Our political correspondent Udi Segal reports from  Cairo:    [Begin recording] [Segal] The negotiations between the PLO  and Israeli delegations in Cairo will continue unabated until  the Gaza-Jericho First agreement is signed. This piece of news  was revealed by Dr. Nabil Sha'th a short while ago. Sha'th said  that the negotiations were making rapid progress. A written  document noting down all the agreements on civilian issues was  presented for the first time today. Work continues on the  documents, or rather on the thick pamphlets, pertaining to  security and legal issues. The main differences still revolve  around issues of jurisdiction.    As for the issue of Palestinian prisoners, Dr. Nabil Sha'th  asserted that progress had been made, noting that in general, he  could no longer describe any issues as problematic. Sha'th  sketched out the problems the delegations would have to confront  in future.    [Sha'th, in English] The Israeli delegation for the first  time will remain here all through this weekend. We are also  going to remain here. We are at the stage of final drafting and  final redrafting, therefore it is difficult to say when. We are  working every day till the day of signing from now on.    [Segal translates above remarks and continues] When the  correspondents became insistent, Sha'th smiled apologetically  and said that since he had come under criticism for being overly  optimistic, he would not specify a date for signing the  agreement until the actual invitations to the signing ceremony  had been printed. Sha'th also confirmed that Foreign Minister  Shim'on Peres would arrive in Cairo tomorrow morning. Egyptian  Foreign Ministry sources said that Peres would meet tomorrow  afternoon with President Husni Mubarak, PLO Chairman Yasir  'Arafat, and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher who is  arriving in Egypt this evening.    Minister Shulamit Aloni is also in Cairo and receives  occasional updates on the negotiations. Minister Aloni said the  agreement would probably be signed next week and called on Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Rabin to show greater flexibility with regard  to the Palestinian demands for their own postage stamp,  passport, and telephone area code.    [Aloni] I think that the agreement can be signed next week.  The problem is whether or not the Palestinians raise new issues  and whether or not we show narrow-mindedness. As soon as the  security problems are resolved we should move forward and try to  make things easier, bearing in mind that we control them and are  thus the last country in the world dominating another people.  We should start easing things for them. I think that today the  prime minister holds the key to most of the decisions and I hope  that he brings the issues before the cabinet. All these  ostensible symbols of sovereignty that scare some people so much  should not be so terrifying. Palestine was a British colony for  30 years and had its own stamps. That did not make Palestine  independent and we needed a War of Independence before we became  a sovereign country. [end recording]</p>

			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Labour advantage eludes UK THE lower degree of regulation in Britain's labour market has not given the country any noticeable competitive edge over other European countries, according to a survey published today by the Institute for Personnel Management. It says: 'There seems to be little correlation between legal regulation and the attraction of and movement towards flexibility.' The study, based on research from the Price Waterhouse Cranfield Project, found that employers across western Europe are increasingly introducing temporary and fixed-term contracts for workers. There has also been an increase in shift or weekend working, overtime and sub-contracting as companies move away from the 9 am to 5 pm, five-day week.

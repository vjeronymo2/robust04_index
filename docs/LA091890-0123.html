			<p><P> September 18, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW: FORTEPIANO RECITAL SHEDS LIGHT ON MOZART  </P> <P> The typical piano recital includes something for everyone. A serious Beethoven  sonata is partnered with a sentimental Chopin nocturne; Debussy's evanescent  pastels carefully foil Lisztian pyrotechnics. Preethi de Silva's recital Sunday  afternoon in the Athenaeum, however, was atypical in both programming and  choice of instrument.  </P> <P> Confining her program to works written between 1775-1790 by two Germanic  composers, Mozart and C.P.E. Bach, de Silva offered a probing, insightful foray  into a musical lode mined only superficially by most contemporary piano  soloists. A native of Sri Lanka, de Silva is a member of the Scripps College  music faculty.  </P> <P> To give the authentic period flavor to her rarefied repertory, de Silva brought  with her a fortepiano, a faithful modern copy of a Viennese piano made in 1796  by the builder Johann Koennicke.  </P> <P> Though a Viennese fortepiano looks like a Baroque harpsichord, its dry, sweet  sound is made by a hammer mechanism (not from plucking) from which modern  pianos have evolved. The fortepiano's small scale and wooden frame (the lack of  an iron frame prevents a high degree of tension in the strings) produces an  intimate sonority that invites reflective, even introspective, playing. De  Silva's understated demeanor and the modest scale of the Athenaeum's room were  ideally matched to this end.  </P> <P> In Mozart's C Minor Fantasy, K. 475, and Adagio in B Minor, K. 540, de Silva  shed light on the improvisatory character of a composer who is usually  presented as a paragon of perfectly proportioned structure. Mozart never  thought of his works as "classical," and de Silva ignored that customary  label's interpretive straitjacket. Her Mozart was full of nuance, flexibility  and intimacy. If her supple, carefully manicured keyboard technique facilitated  the obligatory passage work, it also tended to sound somewhat emotionally  contained, too monochromatic. Although she exploited the instrument's colors --  especially the burnished clarity of the bass notes -- her own emotional palette  seemed constricted.  </P> <P> Placing these works along with two Mozart sonatas in the context of C.P.E.  Bach's flighty C Minor Rondo and quirky, mercurial C Major Fantasia highlighted  Mozart's stylistic dependence on a composer who is usually relegated to  historical footnotes. But if the motion picture "Amadeus" celebrated Mozart as  a bizarre genius, programs such as de Silva's help underscore that Mozart was  also a child of his time, one who benefited from the stylistic innovations of  his colleagues.  </P></p>

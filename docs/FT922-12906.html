			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / UK Company News: Hammerson net asset value falls to 637p HAMMERSON, the UK's third largest property group, yesterday announced that its net asset value fell by 23 per cent, from 832p to 637p per share, in 1991. Pre-tax profits fell 21 per cent, from Pounds 70.7m to Pounds 55.5m. Although operating profits increased from Pounds 53.6m to Pounds 55.4m, property trading profits fell from Pounds 17.1m to just Pounds 100,000. An extraordinary item of Pounds 96.6m resulted principally from a write-off against a development property in Fifth Avenue in New York. Mr Sydney Mason, chairman, was cautious. 'The majority of the property markets worldwide in which the group operates are experiencing the most depressed conditions in living memory. The substantial oversupply of unlet accommodation means that recovery will be slow and will lag by some time an improvement in world economies,' he said. Net borrowings at the year end totalled Pounds 824m, which taken with the fall in property values, resulted in an increase in gearing from 54 per cent to 78 per cent. UK net rental income rose by more than 12 per cent to Pounds 52.3m. Net rental income overseas increased by 6 per cent. The underlying value of the group's properties fell 15.9 per cent to Pounds 1.98bn at the year end. Earnings per share fell 27 per cent from 31p to 22.5p. A final dividend of 17p makes an unchanged total of 20.5p. COMMENT Hammerson can rightly boast the best geographically diversified portfolio of any UK property company, with strong cash flow, excellent tenants and a relatively small development programme. But this is small comfort in the world's worst property slump, as demonstrated by the 45 per cent fall in its net asset value in the past two years. The deflation of property values will probably continue this year, with analysts pencilling in a further 10 per cent fall in net asset value. Canada, where Hammerson has 26 per cent of its assets, is a particular concern thanks to the predicament of Olympia &amp; York, the cash-strapped Canadian developer. The unfurling of O&amp;Y's problems, combined with fears - which proved accurate  - about the asset values in this set of results, has pushed Hammerson's share price down in recent days. After a further 6p fall to 356p yesterday, the shares are on a discount to net assets of 38 per cent, assuming a net asset value of 574p next year. With such a yawning discount and a dividend yield of 8.4 per cent, there are no compelling reasons to sell the shares. But given the depressed sentiment towards property and the remote prospects of recovery, enthusiasm is in equally short supply.</p>

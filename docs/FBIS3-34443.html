The Israeli minister expressed his happiness over his  meeting  this evening with President Husni Mubarak, which, according to  him, took place upon the invitation of his excellency.    He said that the negotiations are going on continuously. If  the need should arise on both sides for us, "myself and Chairman  [al-ra'is] 'Arafat," to meet, "we will meet with each other to  overcome the obstacles."    Shim'on Peres praised the great cooperation the Palestinians  and the Israelis are getting from the Egyptian side.    PLO Executive Committee member Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh and head of  the PLO's Information Department, clarified on his part that  this evening, it will become clear whether there is a  possibility to initial a paper over which both sides, the  Palestinian and the Israeli, agree. He noted that so far, this  has not been confirmed.    'Abd-Rabbuh said that the issues still under discussion are  the same that were discussed before in Cairo, Taba, and Davos.

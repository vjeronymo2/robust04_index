			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / The real contest to succeed Delors now begins: With Sutherland in, the opaque process of electing a Commission president is made more public Over the next month, European Union leaders will be sounded out by the current Greek presidency of the Twelve on who they want to succeed Mr Jacques Delors at the head of the European Commission. If, as still expected, there is a loud enough murmur in favour of outgoing Dutch premier Ruud Lubbers, this opaque selection process could be over in minutes when the 12 heads of government convene at the Corfu summit on June 24-25. But if a contest develops between Mr Lubbers and his fellow Christian Democrat, Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the prime minister of Belgium, then Mr Peter Sutherland, the Irish director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, who threw his hat in the ring on Tuesday night, is in with a chance. Mr Sutherland, a consumate self-publicist with a nice sense of timing, clearly thinks so. He concedes that the question is 'entirely hypothetical', but that if asked to put himself forward, 'I would have to give it serious consideration'. But will he be asked? The Commission presidency race is about as permeable to outsiders as a papal succession. EU governments leak or intimate what they say are their preferences as the process evolves, but with the tactics and knowledge that all 12 'cardinals' have in the end to be unanimous. Sir Leon Brittan, the external economic affairs commissioner, has very openly campaigned for Mr Delors' job. This has done European citizens the service of generating what little public debate there is about who should fill it, although it is unlikely to be him, simply because he is from Britain, a semi-detached member state with two opt-outs from the Maastricht treaty. Mr Sutherland's publicly discreet declaration has enlivened the game, and should now generate more debate. Like Sir Leon in 1989-92, he was a forceful competition commissioner in Brussels in 1985-88. His Euro-credentials are sound, he is ambitious, and after securing the Uruguay Round world trade deal he is a figure on the international stage. After the 10-year tenure of Mr Delors, a French Socialist, EU club rules point to a conservative from a small member state. Mr Lubbers, a cautious Euro-Atlanticist, and Mr Dehaene, a mainstream federalist, are both Christian Democrats from small countries who fit the bill. As an Irish liberal, so too does Mr Sutherland. But his only chance is if they both stay in the race, enabling him to come up the middle as a compromise candidate. This is still a long shot. First, the Sutherland challenge will force Mr Lubbers to campaign, according to the word from the Hague. The Dutchman has already been in Athens, and can be expected in other main capitals soon. Second, the Christian Democrats are not the inner-EU club they once were. After Mr Lubbers' own defeat in the Netherlands, they are down to the coalitions they command in Luxembourg, Belgium, and Germany. An intra-Christian Democrat fight under these circumstances is unlikely, and Mr Dehaene is understood not to want to take on Mr Lubbers publicly. Only Spain has sounded Mr Sutherland out, although he could almost certainly count on Britain's support. But Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who has no personal warmth for Mr Lubbers, is still likely to want to get a Christian Democrat in, and to do a deal with France, which despite its close relations with Ireland, is more likely to favour Mr Dehaene. Mr Sutherland has a big domestic problem to overcome as well. He is a member of the opposition Fine Gael party in Ireland, at a time when Fianna Fail and the Labour party govern in coalition. The current Irish commissioner for social affairs, Mr Padraig Flynn from Fianna Fail, has made it clear he has no intention of making way for Mr Sutherland. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, would therefore have to be assured by his colleagues that Ireland was getting the Commission presidency before contemplating switching horses. Yesterday in parliament, Mr Reynolds said his own election agent was about as likely to get the job. But the Dublin government has come under sufficient pressure from questions in the Dail and speculation in the Irish press for Mr Dick Spring, the foreign minister and deputy prime minister, to say in Brussels this week that if Mr Sutherland wanted the job, he should indicate his interest. This the Gatt chief has now done, and neither component of the Irish coalition would relish being charged with passing up the chance of what Mr Sutherland heavily underlined as 'a very important position for Ireland, for Europe, and the world.' The real contest now begins.</p>

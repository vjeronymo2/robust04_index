			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Carsberg quits Heseltine's long shadow The seeds of Sir Bryan Carsberg's decision to quit the Office of Fair Trading were probably planted in the early months after his departure from his former role as regulator of telecommunications. He moved from a role in which he was able to exercise considerable energy and freedom into a new post circumscribed by the powers of others: most notably Mr Michael Heseltine at the Department of Trade and Industry. There is little doubt that he found this frustrating and it may well be that the scope of his new role as secretary-general of the International Accounting Standards Committee was the crucial factor. There is no reason to doubt the sentiments of one of his officials who said last night that he was leaving to fulfil a new role, not to escape an old one. He will not be an easy act to follow and it is significant that the government felt the need to press him into staying six months. Finding a replacement of his calibre will be tough. His last six months will not be easy. He will be busy vetting the bids for shipbuilders VSEL from GEC and BAe and the proposed merger between the Leeds and Halifax building societies. But while his friends and colleagues may have been shocked, others had seen the writing on the wall. It was evident early this year that inquiry reports from the Monopoly and Mergers Commission were pointing to a shift in competition policy. There is little doubt that this shift, and the frustrations of working in the shadow of Mr Heseltine, helped bring about his decision. The monopolies commission was seen to adopt an increasingly pro-industry approach which even then was seen to threaten a rift with Sir Bryan's competition watchdog. Competition officials and other advocates of a stricter policy believe the Department of Trade and Industry and the commission were relaxing policy to help create strong champions capable of competing in global markets. Mr Heseltine had signalled his preference for industrial over competition policy. The shift appeared to be a cause for alarm at the OFT which, under Sir Bryan, had taken a strongly consumerist approach to competition policy. Sir Bryan gave the impression that he believed markets should be free of any anti-competitive restraints unless they could be shown to benefit the consumer. He has made a number of referrals to the monopolies commission, including fine fragrances and ice cream. These demonstrated his particular concern with vertical restraints - those affecting the supply to the marketplace. But the monopolies commission, under Mr Graeme Odgers, its new chief, appeared to take the view that vertical restraints and anti-competitive practices must clearly damage the consumer interest before it will interfere in an industry. This approach by the commission had put it on a direct collision course with the OFT.</p>

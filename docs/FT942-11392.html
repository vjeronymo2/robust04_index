			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / FT Exporter (28): Better the devil you know - Western bankers are reluctant to do business with new banks in eastern Europe / Credit watch Eastern European import demand for capital and consumer goods is prodigious. But so are the problems facing exporters seeking secure payment across a range of markets in the region. The availability of - particularly - confirmed letters of credit (l/cs) is, at best, patchy. Fundamentally, exporters and their bankers remain concerned about doing business with new corporate and financial institutions, rather than the old, familiar state-backed giants of the communist era. 'The further east you go, the more the newer banks have no correspondent relations,' says the London-based trade finance manager of a leading eastern European bank. 'Fewer and fewer western banks will confirm l/cs involving the growing number of new banks - on most of which they have no information,' he says. The number of banks involved in east-west trade is growing, providing a much-enhanced network which is helping l/c-based business where conditions are appropriate. Availability and terms of l/cs varies from market to market. Poland: the recent agreement between Warsaw and its London Club of commercial creditors has helped to boost western confidence. And, in any case, in recent months exporters have been willing to do business on an open account basis - after balancing improved risk perceptions against the cost of l/c cover. But where l/c cover is required it is generally available for up to 180 days, although longer deferred payments are being requested and arranged. Confirmations are still mainly on state-owned banks. Hungary: reports suggest confirmed l/cs are less commonly mobilised than in most other east European markets. 'It is generally seen as a happy market', says the export finance manager of a big UK company. Much business is focused on a sight (immediate payment) l/c basis. However, for those Hungarian buyers seeing credit, deferred payment l/cs tend not to pose a problem - depending on the individual risks involved. The forfait market may also provide a solution. The London-based Hungarian International Bank and other specialist operations are offering up to 360-day funding - and more in some cases - depending on the specific risks. Romania and Bulgaria: in spite of these countrys' structural economic problems, confirmed l/cs of up to 180 days are available for selected buyers. Russia: eventual debt deals with the country's Paris and London official and commercial club creditors will help to ease difficulties associated with l/c-based business with Russian clients. Arrears on some debts have risen beyond two years with banks unwilling to participate in l/c arrangements. Ukraine: Deals are possible backed by confirmed l/cs, but payments problems and the exhaustion of credit lines makes the confirmation component highly problematic. Kazakhstan: a short-term (up to 180-day) market is emerging, encouraged by Kazakhstan's hydrocarbons and minerals income. Confirmations on Alembank, formerly the local branch of the Soviet Vneshekonombank, are reported.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Export and credit collection survey  -----------------------------------------------------------------------              Exchange                      Most liberal              delays         Collection     suggested Country      (months)       experience     terms  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Australia      2             good-fair       OA Brazil         4             fair            ULC Canada         2             good-fair       OA Chile          3             good-fair       SD Egypt          3             fair-good       ULC Ghana          4             fair            SD Hong Kong      2             good-fair       SD India          2             fair-good       SD Indonesia      3             fair-good       SD Israel         3             fair            ULC Jamaica        3             fair            ULC Japan          1             good            60/SD Kenya          3             fair-poor       ULC South Korea    3             fair-good       SD Kuwait         2             fair-good       SD Malaysia       3             good-fair       SD Mexico         3             fair-good       SD New Zealand    2             good-fair       30/SD Nigeria        4             fair            ULC Oman           3             good-fair       SD Pakistan       3             fair-good       ULC Philippines    3             fair            ULC Saudi Arabia   3             fair            SD Singapore      2             good-fair       30/SD South Africa   3             good-fair       SD Thailand       3             good-fair       SD Trin. &amp; Tobago 3             fair-good       ULC Turkey         3             fair            ULC UAE            3             fair-good       SD US             2             good-fair       60/SD Venezuela      3             fair            ULC Vietnam        5             mostly l/c      ULC  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Footnotes: 1.

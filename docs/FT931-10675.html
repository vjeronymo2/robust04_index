			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / International Company News: Campbell finds the boardroom locked - The US group has 58% of Arnotts but no control of its board Four months after launching a bitterly contested takeover offer, Campbell Soup, the US food group, finds itself the owner of 58 per cent of Arnotts, the Australian biscuit company. One question remains: what happens now? Campbell's ADollars 8.80 a share bid was intended to deliver control of Arnotts by increasing its shareholding from 32.9 per cent to at least 50.1 per cent. In the event, the US group comfortably exceeded the target, after increasing the offer to ADollars 9.50 and extending it for a week. Campbell increased its holding by just over four percentage points on the final day as a number of financial institutions and small shareholders responded to the AMP Society's decision to accept the offer. AMP, Australia's largest financial institution, sold a 6.3 per cent stake in Arnotts to Campbell on Thursday, propelling the US group past its target holding of 50.1 per cent. On a superficial level, the outcome is a triumph for Mr David Johnson, Campbell's Australian-born chief executive, who resisted institutional pressure for a higher price, correctly gambling that sufficient institutional investors would eventually accept ADollars 9.50. It became clear that Mr Johnson's judgment had paid off when the AMP Society, Australia's biggest financial institution, sold a 6.3 per cent shareholding. However, Campbell's relationship to Arnotts underwent an unexpected transformation during the campaign after Schroders Australia, the biscuit group's adviser, spotted a surprise legal defence. The defence related to an agreement drawn up between Arnotts and Campbell in 1985, when the US group took a friendly shareholding as part of Arnotts' defence against an unwelcome bid from Bond Corporation Holdings. The New South Wales courts initially ruled that the agreement was meaningless. However, the appeal court subsequently judged that it prevented Campbell from using its shareholding to elect directors, unless it acquires at least 85.1 per cent of the shares. The effect was to prevent Campbell taking control of Arnotts' board, even though it owns more than half of the company. Campbell will not even be able to influence the appointment of replacements for directors who retire. Mr Bill Purdy, chairman of Arnotts, says Campbell's shareholding gives it no moral rights on the board, and rules out a voluntary agreement to scrap the voting restrictions. The only way Campbell can overcome the terms of the agreement, he says, is to make a second offer which would be recommended by the board - probably ADollars 11 a share. This is precisely the course which Campbell resisted during the takeover battle, but it is one which analysts say may be forced on the group if it is serious about winning control. Alternatively, Campbell could seek permission from the federal government and the Australian Securities Commission to utilise the creeping takeover provisions of the corporations law, which would allow it to acquire 3 per cent of the stock every six months at the market price. However, even if regulatory permission was granted, Campbell would find it difficult to achieve the 85.1 per cent target shareholding because more than 20 per cent of the stock is in the hands of family shareholders, many of whom have said they will not sell under any circumstances. As a result, Campbell has spent about ADollars 330m (USDollars 223m) to acquire a majority shareholding in a company it cannot control. Analysts say its lack of influence may even prevent the consolidation of Arnotts' earnings under US accounting law. Mr Johnson, putting a brave face on the outcome, says Campbell is now the dominant shareholder in Arnotts. He says Campbell 'intends to see that Arnotts invests considerably more than in the past, creating opportunities for Australia, and positioning Arnotts to compete in Asia against larger and more established companies'. Mr Purdy says Arnotts remains prepared to co-operate with Campbell, especially in the increasingly sophisticated Asian market. However, it is not clear whether the two companies will be able to agree on how to go about it. Campbell, which manufactures the up-market Pepperidge Farm brand in the US, wants to use the more comprehensive Arnotts range as a pan-Asian regional brand, to be handled by the US group's extensive marketing and distribution organisation. Arnotts, which most analysts think has been slow to identify Asian opportunities, is more interested in negotiating joint venture agreements with Asian manufacturers, which it believes are more capable of exploiting local markets. The Australian group's strategic planning has been given a significant stimulus by the takeover offer, and it is likely to resist Campbell's attempts to entice it into a closer alliance. Meanwhile, one of the most important lessons to emerge from the takeover battle is the success of Arnotts' appeal to economic nationalism, which formed an important part of Schroders' defence strategy. So effective was the nationalist campaign that the AMP's decision to sell part of its holding, taken on strictly commercial grounds, provoked a significant degree of public outrage. Talkback radio stations reported that more than 95 per cent of callers criticised the AMP. One family shareholder said the society was either desperate or naive.</p>

			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CYPRESS ON TARGET, ROUTS OCC  </P> <P> The Cypress College men's basketball team shot 81% in the first half Saturday  on the way to a 78-55 Orange Empire Conference victory over Orange Coast at  Cypress.  </P> <P> The Chargers made 17 of 21 shots and used a trapping press to take a 44-23 at  the half.  </P> <P> Orange Coast had a bye Wednesday and Cypress Coach Don Johnson figured the  Pirates would be a little slow in reacting.  </P> <P> "When you have a bye you get to practice more, but it had been a week since  they (OCC) played a game," Johnson said. "We thought they might be a little  soft and not ready for a press."  </P> <P> The pressure defense resulted in 10 turnovers, seven of which the Chargers  converted into baskets in the first half.  </P> <P> Cypress' shooting percentage didn't drop much in the second half, when the  Chargers made 14 of 22 shots (64%). Cypress shot 72% (31-43) from the field,  including four of six three-pointers.  </P> <P> Cypress' shooting was worse from free throw line than from the field. The  Chargers made 60% (12 of 20) of their free throws.  </P> <P> "Sure, they played well," OCC Coach Tandy Gillis said. "But we turned the ball  over too much. We gave them 14 points in the first half otherwise we are only  down by seven."  </P> <P> Vince Hizon scored 20 points to lead first-place Cypress (18-3 overall, 4-0 in  conference). It was the fourth time in four conference games that Hizon has  been Cypress' leading scorer.  </P> <P> Eric Pauley and Grayle Humphrey each scored 15 for Cypress. Andre Lamoureux  came off the bench to add 11 for Cypress.  </P> <P> Pauley made seven of nine field goals, Hizon connected on six of 10, and  Humphrey was six of eight, including two of three three-point baskets.  </P> <P> Also for Cypress, Lamoureux was five-of-five from the field, and Brian Kenney  and Mike Renaud each were three-of-three.  </P> <P> Alan Schlines led Orange Coast (12-6, 1-2) with 20 points. He was the only  Pirate in double figures.  </P> <P> OCC made a slight run in the second half, getting to within 11 at, 48-37, with  14:35 left. But Humphrey made a three-pointer with 13:40 left to push Cypress  ahead by 14.  </P> <P> In other Orange Empire Conference games:  </P> <P> Rancho Santiago 87, Golden West 83 -- The score was tied, 83-83, with about a  minute to go, but Rancho Santiago made four free throws to clinch the victory  at Golden West. Corie Blount made both ends of a one-and-one and Mike Hunter  and Cameron Terry made front ends of one-and-ones for Rancho Santiago (20-1,  3-0).  </P> <P> Matt Lein led Rancho Santiago with 19 points. Gene Altimarano had 18 points,  Terry had 17, including five steals, and Blount had 16. Kevin Andersen led  Golden West with 27 points and 10 rebounds. Alex Kreps had 19 points for Golden  West (15-8, 2-2).  </P> <P> Riverside 69, Fullerton 62 -- Deon Robinson and Greg Stienstra each scored 19  points to lead host Riverside (13-10, 2-2). Robinson also had a team-high eight  rebounds. Rashone Lewis, who had a team-high eight rebounds, and Darryl Griffin  each scored 14 points and Kenny Cross had 12 for Fullerton (9-12, 0-3).  </P></p>

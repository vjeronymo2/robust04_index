			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Leftwing stalwart in seamen's union: Obituary of Jim Slater JIM SLATER CBE, general secretary of the National Union of Seamen from 1974 to 1986, has died aged 69. Denounced in 1966 by Labour prime minister Harold Wilson as 'one of the tightly knit group of politically motivated men' behind the damaging seamen's strike of that year, he played a leading part in his union's reform movement, which ousted the rightwing old guard in the early 1970s. An earthy Socialist from Tyneside, he did much to improve seamen's pay and conditions and relax tough disciplines on board ship. A stalwart of the left faction on the TUC general council, he was an opponent of nuclear power - and of the 1982 Falklands war - and a doughty fighter for the miners in their 1984-85 strike. Elected to the union's executive in 1964, he became a full-time official six years later and assistant secretary in 1970 before being elected general-secretary in 1974. In 1986 he was compelled to retire as a result of a power play.</p>

			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Letter: Benefits of performance-related pay undermined by recession Sir, The impression given by Michael Smith 'You pays your money . . .' (July 20) is that if they are introduced properly, following his handy check-list, then individual performance-related pay schemes can overcome the problems they have encountered up until now. Like so much prescriptive management literature this assumes that all problems and contradictions can be avoided by management foresight. Our research in manufacturing companies raises issues which tend to undermine this view. First, PRP schemes have run into difficulties because of the recession and the need for companies to limit pay rises due to profit constraints. This has exposed the problem for PRP schemes of relating individual objectives to overall company performance. Individuals may achieve all of their objectives, show strong commitment and get outstanding performance appraisals, but due to economic circumstances beyond their control find their company is in no position to reward such 'good' employees. Second, in common with many of the culture change programmes put forward by management consultants, PRP probably requires the type of culture it is intended to promote to be already in place in order for it to be accepted. For example, blue collar workers may not be used to the intimacy with their managers needed between appraisers and appraisees. Many disinterested commentators doubt whether corporate culture can be managed, but it is least likely to be changed by anything so prosaic as a payment scheme.

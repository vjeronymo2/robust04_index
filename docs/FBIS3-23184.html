Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionists, said the  Downing Street declaration, signed by Mr John Major, the Prime  Minister, and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish Prime Minister, 11  weeks ago, "had run its course."    His party, the main voice of the loyalists, said it would  not  engage in any new talks involving Dublin until an internal  settlement, including a new devolved assembly for Ulster, had  been reached.    The Unionists offered to continue to talk to the British  Government and other mainstream parties in Northern Ireland.  But Downing Street reaffirmed the Government's view that all  those affected, including Dublin, had to be involved in talks on  the province.    The Government sought to play down the rejection,  emphasising  that efforts to reach a settlement would continue. "We don't  believe in the counsel of despair," said a spokesman.    "We recognise this is a difficult situation, but we will  continue to talk to all the parties to try to find common  ground."    The Downing Street declaration emphasised that progress  would  be made through the three-strand talks -- and not by a purely  internal settlement. This was underlined by Mr Major and Mr  Reynolds last month.    The hardline Democratic Unionist Party led by Mr Ian Paisley  is already boycotting talks. But the official Unionists'  decision is a much more serious blow.    It was the second setback for the Government in 24 hours.  Over the weekend it became clear at Sinn Fein's annual  conference in Dublin that the IRA is not yet prepared to declare  a ceasefire, raising doubts over the effectiveness of the  Downing Street declaration. Ministers believe that the new  hardline position by the Ulster Unionists is dictated largely by  the approaching European elections. The party fears it could be  outflanked by Mr Paisley' s more extreme Democratic Unionists.    Unveiling the Ulster Unionists' Blueprint for Stability,  which includes a demand for a new Bill of Rights as well as a  devolved assembly, Mr Molyneaux scorned the "summitry" by the  two prime ministers.    Two initiatives were now needed, he said: "a genuine effort  to eradicate terrorism" and moves towards "restoring democracy."    Speaking at a Westminster news conference, Mr Molyneaux  said:  "The failure of the declaration has also hideously damaged the  Anglo-Irish Agreement. Things are never going to be the same  again."</p>

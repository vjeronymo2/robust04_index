			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Holiday price war provokes more cuts OWNERS ABROAD yesterday joined the other big tour operators by announcing large price cuts in family holidays for summer 1994 in its Enterprise brochure. The move follows price cuts and early-booking incentives offered last week by rivals including Thomson and Thomas Cook. The big tour operators continued to claim a high level of early bookings for summer 1994. Thomas Cook, the travel agent, said business was '100 per cent up on the same period last year. We have not seen this sort of reaction since the mid-1980s'. Airtours is set to announce its full programme later this week. Thomson, the biggest tour operator, earlier said it had sold almost 250,000 summer 1994 holidays in two days. It has predicted that as many as 2m summer 1994 holidays will be booked by Christmas. Owners Abroad said bookings for three of the company's main destinations had been down this summer - Cyprus (down 26 per cent), Portugal (10 per cent) and Greece (1 per cent) - but it still expected to take two million people on holiday in 1993. Mr Dermot Blastland, managing director of tour operations, said winter 1993-94 bookings were going well and he expected a 5 per cent to 10 per cent increase in the number of people taking package holidays in summer 1994.</p>

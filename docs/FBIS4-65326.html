			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Moncrieff, political editor, PA News] </F>   [Text] Bryan Gould, a former shadow cabinet minister, has  officially resigned as an MP [Member of Parliament]. He is to  return to his native New Zealand to take up an academic post.    This creates a by-election -- the sixth pending -- in  Dagenham, in east London. He had already announced his  intention to quit.    Mr. Gould, 55, a committed Euro-critic, fought John Smith  for  the leadership in 1992 as the torch-carrier of the left. But he  was routed.    He resigned last night as an MP under the technicality of  being appointed by the Chancellor as steward amd bailiff of the  Manor of Northstead. This is an office of profit under the  Crown and prevents its holder from serving as an MP.    The two offices of profit under the Crown which are  alternatively used are the Chiltern Hundreds and the Manor of  Northstead. Theoretically an MP cannot resign but can be  disqualified by accepting such an office.    Holding them, however, generates no income, but a person's  membership of the House automatically lapses.    General election result at Dagenham -- Bryan Gould (Labour)  22,027; Don Rossiter (Conservative) 15,294; Charles Marquand  (Liberal Democrat) 4,824. Majority 6,733. Turnout 70.7    The writ for the by-election may be moved today, along with  others. It could take place on June 9, the same day as the  European elections.</p>

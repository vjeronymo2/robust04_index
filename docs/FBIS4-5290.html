			<p>BFN     [Text] The contents of the "Draft Policy Outline on Reform  of the Tax System," which the Social Democratic Party of Japan  [SDPJ] has drawn up to prepare for discussions on the issue,  have been revealed. In addition to indicating it is ready to  reexamine the balance among taxes on income, consumption, and  assets, the party has also suggested that, in view of the aging  of society, "the times require a shift in the balance with more  weight on consumption taxes," as well as a permanent source of  revenue to make up for shortfalls resulting from income tax  cuts. In its draft policy outline, the SDPJ wants, as  conditions for its endorsement of a consumption tax rise, a  strategic welfare policy to be drawn up, the implementation of  administrative and fiscal reforms, the removal of current  shortcomings in consumption tax, and the redressing of  inequities in the tax system.    In the draft document, the party says: "It is inevitable  that indirect taxes will be the major sources of revenue."    It also stresses the need to raise indirect taxes to help  finance local government welfare programs. However, the party  fails to touch on the issue of turning the consumption tax into  a "tax intended for the financing of pensions program," although  this has been a party demand in the past. The omission seems to  be part of the party's attempt to find a compromise with its  ruling coalition partners, so the draft outline can be expected  to have a big impact on debates within the ruling coalition  parties' council on reform of the tax system.    As a prerequisite to discussing tax reform, the SDPJ  document  stresses the following points must be considered in addition to  working on a strategic policy for social welfare: 1) to redress  inequities in the tax system completely, such as through  consolidated taxation; 2) to remove shortcomings in the current  consumption tax, such as by reexamining the simplified tax  system and relaxing the regressive nature of consumption tax; 3)  to redouble efforts to promote administrative and fiscal reform,  such as through spending cuts; 4) to maintain taxation on land  and rationalize taxation on assets; and 5) to improve indirect  taxation as an independent source of revenue for local  governments.    The draft outline also points out that "we must tackle the  problem of securing necessary revenue sources, taking into  account the effect on revenue sources of the implementation of  administrative and fiscal reforms and the redressing of  inequities in the tax system."    The SDPJ is thereby tacitly acknowledging the need to seek  new revenue sources to offset shortfalls due to income tax cuts  and to finance future social welfare. The draft outline also  says that "considering the likely details of any future welfare  policy, it seems inevitable that indirect taxation will be a  revenue source," indicating that the party believes there must  be a debate on the issue of a increasing consumption tax.    On the balance among income, consumption, and assets taxes,  the draft outline clearly states that "the times require a shift  in the balance with added weight on consumption tax, which  should be levied at the time goods are purchased."    The outline also stresses the need to debate the issue of  raising consumption tax, saying "it is the responsibility of the  party as the largest group in the ruling coalition to hold  in-depth discussion on whether to make a consumption tax rise  the centerpiece of taxation reform once its shortcomings have  been corrected.    In the recent uproar over the announcement of a national  welfare tax, the SDPJ opposed its introduction, saying "it has  not been discussed sufficiently."    In particular, the party firmly asserted that the revenue  generated by the consumption tax rise should be used "to finance  the pensions program." The party, however, failed to touch on  this issue in the draft outline, merely saying it plans to "make  a constructive, responsible judgment on such matters as the  propriety of designating taxes for certain purposes."    The party has clearly tried to avoid clashing with the other  ruling coalition parties, which oppose the SDPJ's idea.  Instead, it makes only a passing reference to a  "medicare-oriented" approach on the issue of improving welfare.  It stresses the need to study plans to introduce a local  consumption tax which have emerged among other ruling coalition  parties. It says that, from the point of view of the local  governments which actually handle the services, it is essential  to "improve consumption taxation (indirect taxes) which places  the emphasis on local governments."    As far as income tax cuts are concerned, the SDPJ spells out  in its draft outline that it plans to maintain the fixed tax  rate reduction in the drastic tax system reform plan at the same  level set for this fiscal year.    The party also proposes to reconsider tax rate  classifications, as well as raising the minimum taxable income,  mainly through raising earned income deductions and basic  deductions.    At the same time the draft outline proposes that the  possibility of reducing corporate taxes should be studied. On  the issue of securing a source of revenue to offset shortfalls  resulting from such tax cuts, the SDPJ intends to allocate  "revenue garnered by reviewing the corporate tax system to  offset expected shortfalls." For example, the party proposes  reexamining various kinds of special tax exemptions, in which  corporations already have vested rights and interests, and a  reduction in corporate reserves.    The SDPJ's draft policy outline was drawn up by the party's  Research Commission on the Tax System (chaired by Ichiro Hino).  The party, which holds the key to successful tax system reform,  plans to discuss this draft outline by assembling concerned  officials from its local chapters and holding a national  convention of policy board chairmen and policymaking officials  on 8-9 April.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Announcer] The Fidesz [Federation of Young  Democrats] and the SZDSZ [Alliance of Free Democrats] are only  willing to continue talks about the media bill if the government  guarantees the independence of television and radio for the  elections. Kata Peli Nagy reports on the joint declaration by  the two parties.    [Nagy] The Fidesz and SZDSZ are ready to continue  negotiations about the media law, but they do not want to  sacrifice principles serving the impartiality of the media. So  far, the two parties have been participating in the coordination  of the media bill on two conditions: One, the government is to  remedy the unfortunate situation reigning in the public media  immediately and two: The future media law is to guarantee the  impartiality of public service television in order that neither  the present, nor any future government should be able to use it  for party political purposes.    However, the two parties' impressions regarding the talks  are  that the government is reluctant to be represented at the  coordination, and Prime Minister Peter Boross has refused talks  about the media situation. Here is Gabor Kuncze, leader of the  SZDSZ election list:    [Begin Kuncze recording] Mindful of the fact that only the  government has any opportunity to intervene in the extremely bad  situation that has evolved, we think that this is an indication  that the present situation in the Hungarian television and radio  suits the government only too well. It intends to maintain the  situation until the elections, and it does not want to negotiate  with the opposition about these issues. Therefore, if the  necessary measures are not carried out, the Fidesz and the SZDSZ  will leave the negotiating table. It is the government's turn to  make a move. [end recording]    [Nagy] The two parties evaluated the internal situation that  has developed in the television and the radio as follows, I  quote: MTV continuously violates the ethical code of election,  it openly incites and slanders in several of its programs. MTV  openly belongs to the government and in the radio an open  political showdown, disguised as professional reorganization, is  being prepared.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [``ub''--unattributed report: ``Stopping the Proliferation </F> of Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Weapons'']    [Text] Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel launched a German  initiative on Wednesday [15 December] to prevent the further  proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The 10-point  proposal in the runup to the NATO summit at the beginning of  next year is based on preventive strategies. In view of the  ``cooperative approach,'' coercive measures are only conceivable  as a ``last resort'' and with the approval of the United Nations.    The foreign minister's initiative is seen in connection with  U.S. plans to develop new weapons that can be used to intervene  against ``irresponsible states'' or terrorist groups. The  Europeans have so far only shown little interest in  participating in such a concept. The Foreign Ministry announced  that the U.S. considerations start where the those of the  Germans end. Thus, there it does not see such a big  contradiction.    Kinkel stressed that the proliferation of nuclear,  biological, and chemical weapons represents one of the biggest  dangers for world peace after the end of the East-West conflict.  North Korea's refusal to allow inspections threatens peace in  the entire region. In Ukraine, a new de-facto nuclear state  might also develop. According to recent findings, up to 20  states are currently developing nuclear carrier systems, and 10  are developing chemical weapons.    Kinkel pleaded in favor of a global agreement on the  nonproliferation of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons.  The existing treaty should be extended indefinitely.  International coordination should be aimed at first freezing  the potentials of states that are suspected of spreading  weapons. The CSCE was recommended as a model of regional  nonproliferation policies. Other points are stronger export  controls, with particular emphasis on the new supplying  countries in the Third World, and much higher funds for the  destruction of weapons of mass destruction. Kinkel also  suggested an international plutonium control system, a nuclear  weapons register with the United Nations, and a comprehensive  agreement on a nuclear test stoppage. Whereas the United States  wants to achieve a deterring effect with specific intervention  threats, Kinkel's initiative is designed to integrate possible  adventurers and to exert preventive pressure on them.</p>

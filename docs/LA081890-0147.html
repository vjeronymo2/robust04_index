Move the upholstery attachment nozzle  slowly over all surfaces, including channels, tufts and welts. Use the vacuum's  crevice-tool attachment to clean hard-to-reach spots.  </P> <P> If the cushions smell dank from humid weather or other household odors, air  them outdoors on a dry, breezy day. Place the cushions in the shade (to avoid  fading) on a clean surface for several hours. Turn them over at least once  while airing.  </P> <P> Even with regular vacuuming and airing, upholstered fabrics require thorough  cleaning at some point. The method you choose depends on the fabric. Synthetics  and cottons are often washable, so they can be safely shampooed with a mild  detergent or a commercial cleaning product. Most other fabrics require dry  cleaning.  </P> <P> Natural fabrics other than cotton usually need to be dry-cleaned professionally  for a complete cleaning. But soiled or stained areas can often be spot-cleaned  using a commercial solution sold for removing spots on clothing. When applying  these compounds, always wear rubber or vinyl gloves and work in a  well-ventilated area.  </P> <P> Before applying a cleaner of any kind, always test for colorfastness on a small  area of a part that is never seen, such as on the back zipper side of a cushion  or on the arm next to the cushion. Let it dry to see if it causes shrinking.  </P> <P> Here is the procedure for cleaning cotton or synthetic upholstery using the  suds of homemade cleaning solution. Remember to use only the foam: Never apply  the solution itself.  </P> <P> 1. Prepare the following equipment and supplies: a whisk broom or a vacuum with  an upholstery attachment, a rubber or plastic scraper, a pan of warm water,  soft cloths and paper towels. Put two tablespoons soap flakes and two  tablespoons ammonia in 1 quart hot water.  </P> <P> 2. Brush or vacuum the furniture well. After the cleaning solution has jelled,  whisk it until a mass of suds forms. Rub suds into a small, concealed area of  the fabric. Let it dry. If the area fades, discolors or shrinks, have the job  done professionally. If not, shampoo the rest of the fabric.  </P> <P> 3. With a suds-covered cloth, gently rub the suds in a small area. When the  suds become soiled, scrape them off with the scraper. Wipe the scraper clean on  paper towels.  </P> <P> 4. Wet a cloth in the warm water, wring well and wipe sudsed area. Dampen the  fabric only slightly, don't soak it.  </P> <P> 5. Repeat these steps, overlapping previously cleaned areas. Change suds, rinse  water and cloths when they get dirty. Dry the upholstery with an electric fan.  </P> <P> Distributed by AP Newsfeatures.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> WHITTIER CHRISTIAN DOWNS BELL-JEFF  </P> <P> Whittier Christian's Ron Papazian and Scott Jordan combined for 188 yards and  four touchdowns in a nonleague game against Bellarmine-Jefferson on Saturday at  Burroughs High.  </P> <P> Then they played the second half.  </P> <P> When it finally ended, Jordan -- a hard-running tailback -- had 203 yards in 23  carries. Papazian, a 6-foot-2, 200-pound fullback, carried 20 times for 142  yards and five touchdowns. And Whittier Christian, 4-0 and ranked third in the  Division IX poll, accumulated more real estate than Donald Trump in a 42-0 win.  </P> <P> "We were a little surprised the offense executed so well," Whittier Coach Phil  Bravo said. "We moved the ball pretty good."  </P> <P> About the only manner in which Whittier might have moved the ball any better  would have been to toss the football into the back of a Chevy and put it in  overdrive. Whittier Christian was in fourth gear all night, gaining 399 rushing  yards (7.1 yards a carry), 423 total yards and 18 first downs.  </P> <P> "They completely manhandled us," Bell-Jeff Coach Doug Woodlief said.  </P> <P> Whittier led, 28-0, at the half after four touchdown runs from Papazian, then  added two more scores in the third quarter -- on a 46-yard scamper by Papazian  and a two-yard run by Jordan.  </P> <P> Jordan missed last week's game because of a bruised collarbone.  </P> <P> How bad was it for Bell-Jeff? Whittier Christian faced first and 50 from its  24, then scored three plays later.  </P> <P> The Whittier defense, meanwhile, limited Bell-Jeff to 48 total yards (31  rushing in 20 carries) and three first downs. Bell-Jeff (0-3-1) had only nine  total yards at the half and possession for five of the half's 24 minutes.  </P> <P> "We were even more surprised with our defense," Bravo said. "(The defense)  performed well in crucial times."  </P> <P> But Saturday night, the only crucial moment was the opening coin flip -- which  Whittier Christian also won. JEFF RILEY In another game: Faith Baptist 23,  Flintridge Prep 6 -- Alex Estrada had 11 carries for 146 yards and made a key  interception for Faith Baptist in an eight-man game at Flintridge Prep.  Estrada's interception on the one-yard line in the second quarter preserved a  15-0 halftime lead. Quarterback Gavin Amos, who scored both first-half  touchdowns on runs of two and one yard, had 10 carries for 33 yards and was  five of 13 passing for 128 yards. Amos hit Steve Roe with a 69-yard scoring  pass early in the fourth quarter. Quarterback Chris Bisgaard scored on a  one-yard run in the fourth quarter for the only Flintridge Prep touchdown.  </P></p>

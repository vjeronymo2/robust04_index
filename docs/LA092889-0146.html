			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STRATEGIC ARMS PACT LIKELY BEFORE SUMMIT, BUSH SAYS  </P> <P> In his most upbeat assessment yet of the prospects for reaching an agreement to  cut strategic nuclear arms, President Bush said Wednesday there is "a good  likelihood" that a treaty will be ready for signing by the time he meets next  year with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.  </P> <P> But Bush balked at accepting a Soviet challenge to halt all nuclear weapons  tests, arguing that they are needed to maintain confidence in the safety and  soundness of the warheads.  </P> <P> With senior Soviet and U.S. officials publicly trading optimistic forecasts  almost daily -- much as they have engaged in hostile verbal attacks in past  years -- the President's comments reflect what he twice called the "civil  climate" marking Washington's current relations with Moscow.  </P> <P> Bush made the remarks in an interview in the Oval Office with a small group of  reporters before flying by Marine Corps helicopter to Charlottesville to attend  a two-day meeting of the nation's governors. Bush called the sessions to  examine the state of education in the United States. A transcript of the  interview was made available here by the White House.  </P> <P> The President, who is scheduled to meet with Gorbachev in late spring or early  summer, said the agreement to meet the Soviet leader "perhaps will serve as a  catalyst for moving forward" in the effort to cut U.S. and Soviet arsenals of  strategic, or long-range, nuclear weapons by 50%.  </P> <P> "It's not a given," he said. "But I would agree that we have a good likelihood  that might happen."  </P> <P> The President added: "I don't want to set it up so that if we don't have every  't' crossed and 'i' dotted, that the summit next spring or summer is considered  a failure."  </P> <P> His optimism on the prospects for an arms agreement echoed that of Soviet  Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, who said in an address Tuesday to the  U.N. General Assembly that by the time of the summit conference, "we may have  passed the last turn on the road toward a treaty reducing strategic offensive  arms. These are real prospects."  </P> <P> Shevardnadze also challenged the United States to ban all production of its  newest forms of chemical weapons -- a step that Bush said he "absolutely"  rejected.  </P> <P> On Monday, Bush said in a speech at the United Nations that the United States  would cut its stockpile of poison gas by 80%, if the Soviets would reduce their  larger supplies to a level that would be equal to the reduced American  stockpiles.  </P> <P> The Soviet foreign minister also had said that the Soviet Union would reinstate  a previous moratorium on nuclear tests "any day and hour if the United States  reciprocates."  </P> <P> But Bush said Wednesday: "As long as we are dependent for a deterrence based on  nuclear weapons, I would have difficulty eliminating all testing.  </P> <P> "It's important that these weapons be safe. It's important they be sound," he  said. His opposition to halting the tests reflects a long-running Pentagon  concern that a failure to routinely check the operations of its long-range  missiles and nuclear warheads would lead to uncertainty about whether they will  function accurately -- and thus serve as a deterrent to others' aggression.  </P> <P> Assessing the improvement in U.S.-Soviet relations, Bush said that "we don't  have a disconnect with Mr. Gorbachev," a condition that has eased discussions  of "contentious regional issues or arms control issues."  </P> <P> "There have been times . . . when it was very difficult even to bring subjects  up without getting a rhetorical diatribe on the question," he said. "And now  you can talk about any subject very openly. This is a very constructive  development."  </P> <P> Still, the President said, the two nations "will probably have strong  differences for a long time." He added: "I don't want to do something naive or  silly in defense just because we are working more closely with the Soviets  today."  </P> <P> Answering complaints by Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) that  his response to the greater political openness in the Soviet Union has been too  timid, the President said, "The team I have here (in Washington) knows what  it's doing."  </P> <P> On Capitol Hill on Wednesday, Mitchell called on the Administration to grant  most-favored-nation trading status to the Soviet Union. He urged Bush to grant  Moscow a temporary waiver of the 1974 Jackson-Vanik Amendment, which denied  trade concessions until the Soviet Union allowed Jews and others to emigrate  freely. Gorbachev lifted most emigration restrictions last year.  </P> <P> But a White House spokesman, Roman Popadiuk, said that the Administration does  not plan to lift the Jackson-Vanik restrictions.  </P> <P> "Our position is that we would have to see some legislation, some  institutionalization of the right of emigration, before lifting Jackson-Vanik,"  he said.  </P> <P> The President defended Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's warnings of the risks of  too close a relationship with Moscow, and said: "We speak with one voice.  Cheney's voice is loud and clear. And he's saying, don't do anything dumb.  Don't make the mistake of unilaterally disarming -- knocking out significant  strategic modernization programs at the very minute that the Soviet Union is  going forward on the modernization front."  </P></p>

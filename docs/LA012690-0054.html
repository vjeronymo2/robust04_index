			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> AT THE GALLERIES: A PAINTER WHO LOOKS BENEATH THE SURFACE  </P> <P> Little of what Peter Zokosky paints is remarkable, and yet it is all  remarkable. Familiarity breeds no contempt in his images of cows, plants,  humans, clouds and sea creatures but instead evokes curiosity, wonder, respect.  It's a matter of perception, the Long Beach painter suggests, a matter of  looking at the surface of the world and beyond, and crediting both realities as  equally true and accurate.  </P> <P> Zokosky, whose work is on view at the Felicita Foundation Gallery (247 S.  Kalmia, Escondido), states the case fairly plainly in his painting, "Seeing  Cows." Five of the bovine beasts, serene and self-content, stand in profile on  a gently rolling green pasture. One of the cows is painted in a traditional,  naturalistic style, a faithful representation of the animal's size, shape and  surface as seen by the naked eye. Another, however, is a mere skeleton, and  another an anatomical cross-section of muscles and bones. Another view forgoes  the pattern of pelt to map the cow's digestive tract. The last exists only in  outline, as a crude, bullet-shaped mass with straight-as-stick legs like those  drawn by a child.  </P> <P> However different these views, they all represent cows. Each definition is as  valid as the next and they coexist, comfortably. This, perhaps, is the  "Legitimate Paradox" referred to in the show's title. What we see casually,  with unquestioning eyes, is coupled in Zokosky's paintings with visions of  submerged realities, hidden systems and latent mysteries. The natural world  assumes a fascinating, fluid identity when these ordinarily concealed facets  are brought to the surface to mingle with more familiar aspects of the same  subjects. By paying as much attention to the unseen as to the seen, Zokosky  sharpens our awareness of the layered quality of life, the multiple readings  possible of any subject or situation.  </P> <P> In "Gardening," the artist exposes the botanical and biological processes at  work while a couple tends to their back yard, thereby transforming the mundane  suburban scene into a narrative rich with sexual symbolism. In the pair's  well-kept garden, manicured shrubs stand in a neat row before a masonry brick  wall and a sapling stands on the lawn with the help of a supporting stake. The  woman waters the grass with a hose and the man stands across from her, pausing  from his work with a hoe.  </P> <P> The predictability of the scene dissipates in the details. Zokosky shifts the  perspective beneath the couple's feet and renders the earth below in  cross-section, revealing the fine, shallow roots of the grass, the deeper, more  complex root system of the young tree, the numerous rocks embedded in the dirt  and the worm channels winding through it. The woman's short skirt bears a  pattern that seems abstract, but actually diagrams her reproductive system. Her  pairing with the sinuous lines and nourishing function of the hose confirms her  sexual role, as does her mate's prop of a straight, solid hoe.  </P> <P> Zokosky turns the familiar inside out again in "Skeleton and Goat" and in the  diptych, "Hare and Hare After." Each work shows two views of its subject, one  an accurate rendering of the animal's texture and mass, the other of its  skeletal or muscular system. In "One, Two, Three," Zokosky shows what the  unaided eye can see, but cannot seize -- the individual movements that merge to  form continuous motion. Here, a single gray dog is seen simultaneously at three  different stages of a backward flip. Like the pioneering, stop-action  photographs of Eadweard Muybridge, Zokosky's painting fragments a single  action, allowing slow scrutiny of a split-second sight.  </P> <P> While many of Zokosky's works give access to the visually inaccessible, others  elevate the known to the status of the revered through an elegant painting  style of rich color and radiant light, as in "Serpent" and "Gibbons in the  Trees." The artist's unpopulated landscapes are far less mesmerizing. They lack  both the punning humor and the odd, revelatory character of the animal  paintings.  </P> <P> "Gentleman" is, perhaps, the oddest and most disturbing of all, for it  introduces the notion that man is not only blind to much of the natural world,  but also manipulative, patronizing and possessive of it.  </P> <P> In this painting, a young woman sits at the base of a tree, as if engaged in a  lesson with the gorilla seated opposite her on a small folding stool. She holds  up a panel with a picture of a man; two other panels, depicting an antelope and  an Oreo cookie, lay beside her on the jungle floor.  </P> <P> This curious scene caricatures our insistence on relating to the non-human  world in strictly human terms. The beauty and mystery so abundant in that  world, and so well articulated in Zokosky's paintings, would seem to cast us  better in the role of student than teacher.  </P> <P> The show continues through March 3.  </P></p>

			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Gardening: My Frenchman is a blackleg - Robin Lane Fox encounters a foreign bird in the bushes, and is deeply suspicious DURING the past three months, I have been sharing the garden with a Frenchman. He appeared one early evening, took the measure of my terrace, and stood, looking lost, until he scented Heliotrope White Swan and was reminded of bedding-out in France. In a fluster, he vanished, down towards a nearby border from which he kept up a guttural incomprehensible harangue. I am used to sharing the lawn with a hedgehog, the neighbour's collie and a love-struck mallard who has fixated on me since I first gave her some stale breadcrumbs. The trick never worked with women. My Frenchman is another matter; Alectrois rufa, the red-legged partridge seems to be using my home, the Old Vicarage, as a safe house. French partridges in English eyes have French habits. They have no idea how to be sporting and when Englishmen chase them out of cornfields, they refuse to fly over guns but they run sideways instead. They are grounded red-legs, black-legging English sport. They must believe that they are far too grand to talk to pheasants: otherwise, they would have shared the secret of life. In a garden, they are bewildering. For a moment, my Frenchman looks as if he might, after all, be impressed by white cosmos daisies a la bagatelle and old-fashioned roses with superior French names. Then, with a scurry, he is off to the lilacs, moving fast, keeping low and eluding all attempts to corner him on the way past. During the summer, certain French habits have become clearer. Swimming pools are regrettably of no interest to them and so far as I can judge, they only come to life at 6pm. Nightly, when it is time for a Pernod, my Frenchman reappears on the terrace, calls for attention and then does his usual bolt when hard choices have to be made. Safe among the Lavatera Barnsley, at first he maintained a long Gallic monologue. He began it at the time when the dons of Cambridge were wondering whether to deconstruct themselves and give an honorary degree to that enemy of meaning, Jacques Derrida, the French academic, I began to think that I had been chosen for canvassing, Right from the damask roses came nightly broadcasts which destroyed all signifiers and referred to nothing except themselves. A bird in the bushes was worth 20 French texts in the hand. By July, I knew I was wrong. It was no longer one Frenchman, preaching deconstruction. There was a Frenchman and two French henpersons, drawn to the bushes by the sound which my Peter Scott bird-book describes rather kindly as the noise of a scythe whose blade is being whetted. Were they, perhaps, on a financial mission, minority shareholders fleeing from Printemps or simply on a world-wide dodge, trying to scape from tax? According to my Peter Scott book, the French Partridge has the status of 'resident.' A change of domicile would be no help. Scott also remarks that its habits are 'catholic.' Here, perhaps, lay the answer: A catholic mission to old English vicarages, conducted in twilight with two tame females in tow. Perhaps it began as something of the sort, but by late July the three had become five. Scythe-whetting sounded stridently and I watched the manoeuvres with apprehension. While Derrida grated on among the lilacs, the four would fan out in twos, keeping low, hugging the ground, and obeying that truly French rule in a country which might mind: let the woman go first. In English gardens, twilight during summer is supposed to be a hint of heaven. In mine, throughout August, it was a time for combat manoeuvres, conducted by ornithological walkie-talkies being held out of sight. I was brought up never to shoot in the garden and never to shoot birds which refused to fly. When they trampled on the tobacco plants and roughed up the agapanthus, I did wonder if a catapult would kill a moving target. Suddenly, they have gone. Or, rather, the four combat-trainees have vanished, leaving Derrida on the look-out for another captive audience in the lonely, deconstructed world. Whatever they have practised, they know how to execute: vicarage-trained agents are out there, somewhere, back on the run among their fellow Frenchmen. I cannot help noticing that three days after they left, the French polls for the Great Vote took a nasty lurch towards Non. Perhaps the ground-workers are now in position, risking nothing flighty but running the legs off the opposition. In the half-light, among the first autumn asters, I may be over-interpreting, but it is easy to hear a word like Maastricht in a sound like a scythe being sharpened along the blade.</p>

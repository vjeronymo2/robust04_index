			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: EU shows flexibility on banana regime The European Commission yesterday signalled that it was prepared to be flexible in its dispute with Latin American countries over banana imports by fixing a much higher import quota than usual for the second quarter of this year. It set the quota at 590,120 tonnes, about 60,000 tonnes higher than the average of second quarter imports over the past four years. The move came as the European Union awaited word from Costa Rica on whether it would drop its complaint to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade about the EU's preferential banana trading arrangements with former colonies in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific under the Lome convention. The EU is expected to resubmit its offer to increase the annual Latin American quota to 2.2m tonnes over two years from the 2m tonnes fixed last July if Costa Rica joins Colombia, Nicaragua and Venezuela, the other three main suppliers, in abandoning the complaint. A meeting is provisionally scheduled for tomorrow between Mr Rene Steichen, EU agriculture commissioner, and Mr Roberto Rojas, the Costa Rican foreign trade minister. 'We've had no indication from them that they're prepared to accept our offer, but we would hope to find a solution,' said a commission official. The rise in the second quarter quota is in response to applications for import licences for that amount, which corresponds to 29.5 per cent of the annual 2m tonne quota. 'It doesn't mean the 2m tonnes will change,' said the official. 'But the facility is there to import more if there's a demand and we're willing to use these mechanisms. 'By accepting all the licence demands, no one can turn round and say to us that it's the regime which is causing the rise in prices.'</p>

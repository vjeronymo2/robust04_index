			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Survey of Turkish Finance, Investment and Industry (14): Discord over use of revenues / Privatisation - the government has set an ambitious target PRIVATISATION of Turkey's state-run economic enterprises (SEEs) and of the government's participation in local companies is causing much debate and uncertainty. The state has an interest in 235 enterprises, either as a majority shareholder, an affiliate or a minority partner in a privately-managed concern. There has long been agreement in principle that the SEEs are in need of reform, not least because of the heavy demands they make on the public spending borrowing requirement (PSBR). Reform has also been seen to be in the interests of greater economic and financial efficiency and the promotion of wider share ownership. But under the coalition government of Mr Suleyman Demirel, residual opposition to foreign ownership within the economy has been resurfacing. Where the debate has become complicated is over the use of the money earned. The government wants earnings to help offset the budget deficit. Foreign bankers fear that money generated by the sales of government holdings is going into a 'big black hole' and not being used for investment in productive assets. They express doubts about the long-term planning of the authorities handling privatisation. By contrast, the Public Participation High Council (PPHC), the decision-making and executive body of the privatisation programme, and the Public Participation Administration (PPA), the agency responsible for the planning and execution of the programme and entrusted with selling the state's shares in companies, feel that the earnings should not be used for offsetting the budget deficit. Mr Ustun Sanver, the PPA's president, argues that the funds brought in could be put to more productive use - not least to convince the Turkish public and potential foreign investors that there are benefits in the privatisation of enterprises that have been, since the end of the 1920s, central to the economic philosophy of Turkey - state capitalism. Confusion over the running of the privatisation policy was also reflected by the establishment this year by the new government of Toyok, an independent professional agency to restructure the 120 companies in which the state has a majority, in preparation for sale by private block sale or public offer. The intention was to depoliticise the privatisation issue. However, Toyok has not yet received the legislation to operate. The first steps towards disposal of SEEs came early in 1984. By the different methods of sales, the PPA records that, between July 1986 and July 1992, 26 companies were privatised by block sale, amounting to Dollars 144.1m. The majority were in the animal-feed, food-processing and beverages sectors. Twenty-three companies privatised by public offering over the same period brought in Dollars 401.6m. They were mainly concerned with heavier industries, including electricity production, cement, and motor manufacturing. This year, the PPA is embarking on new tactics to speed up privatisation. According to Mr Sanver, negotiations should have been complete for the transfer of the most successful sector privatised - 11 cement companies - after a series of bid negotiations resulting in more than Dollars 400m of sales. Along with completed selling of the state's stake in telecommunications companies such as Netas (49 per cent) and Teletas (18 per cent), and also in Sekerbank, Konya Seker, a food-processing company, the vehicle manufacturers TOE, and a mining company IDC, this could all bring in Dollars 758m this year. While this falls short of the projections, it does illustrate the fact that privatisation revenues for 1992 are not that far short of total revenues accrued during the previous six years. Whereas, previously, there was a protracted series of bidding rounds, in future a minimum acceptable appraised value is to be announced. Block sale would then be awarded to bids above or close to that value. In the first three months of next year, under this new pattern it was hoped to complete the sell off of three companies in the agro-industry sector: SEK (dairy products), EBK (fish and meat processing) and 26 country-wide animal feed plants. But Mr Sanver said last month that, 'as a technician', he did not think their privatisation would be possible 'in today's conditions'. Plans for 1993 include 17 companies, mainly in the food-processing and beverages sectors, but also in the automotive industries. The intention, under preliminary PPA studies for the 1994-98 period, is to target much larger undertakings. Under consideration are the state-operated iron and steel sector, the state-owned petrochemical, petroleum, refining and distribution sector, electricity production and distribution, and the state-owned banking sector. Over the next five years, the PPA said in a position paper last month, its target was to privatise at least 30 per cent of state shares and to generate approximately Dollars 10bn. The PPA is aware that there are battles to be fought on two fronts, at least. The concept of the benefits of privatisation have to be sold to the public, and it has embarked on a series of country-wide seminars and conferences. But beyond the exercise of persuading the Turkish public and foreigners that privatisation is worthwhile, there are local difficulties to be worked out. The PPA disapproves of the Treasury's plan to take 50 per cent from the sale of state holdings for current expenses (ie, the budget deficit). It points out that it funds a considerable number of infrastructure projects. The PPA is also aware that the search for greater efficiency through privatisation will lead to job losses. The PPA, the SSK (the state workers' social insurance agency) and the Treasury are conducting separate studies of how to provide retraining and relocation for displaced workers. There remain some acute and perennial problems. The costs of the existing SEEs to the PSBR, as a proportion of the GNP, remains high and is a drain on the budget. This is where the argument comes in that income from privatisation should help offset this deficit. The whole programme, especially as it moves into the bigger privatisation proposals for heavier industry, is also limited by the ability of the Istanbul stock exchange to sustain large-scale flotation of state-owned assets. The PPA is proposing the establishment of a savings fund, based on the wages and salaries of workers, which could be invested in debt securities. In return, these could be invested in the most successful privatised shares. This would, in theory, help to make people aware of the benefits of privatisation and sound shareholding. But the privatisation programme remains under intense discussion. Indeed, as its status and evolution is debated by different branches of the government, doubt becomes apparent about commitment to pursuing the policy fully. Mr Demirel, at a conference last month, caused some confusion by acknowledging that it had to be carried through, with the priority given to the most saleable sectors. It was a statement which muddied the privatisation policies' priorities and which tended to underline his lack of conviction on the issue.</p>

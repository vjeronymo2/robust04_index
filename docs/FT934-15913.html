			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris sees 3 per cent decline in LVMH AFTER two days of significant gains, the Eurotrack 100 eased a little yesterday, following the trend set on Wednesday afternoon, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS recorded a 3 per cent fall in LVMH on renewed selling after the group's recent disappointing first half results and further sell notes were issued by brokers. The shares lost FFr119 to FFr3,700 in heavy volume. The CAC-40 index slipped 17.05 to 2,147.41 as turnover remained firm at FFr3.5bn. Peugeot was off FFr11 at FFr640 ahead of reporting a first half loss of FFr1.12bn, which came in at the lower end of market forecasts. SocGen was one of the day's best performers, with a gain of FFr14 to FFr676 following an impressive set of first half figures on Wednesday. FRANKFURT traded above 2,000 for the first time at midsession but the DAX index lost steam after that. It closed the session 9.99 higher at 1,997.04 after an intraday high of 2,000.38, and eased to 1,991.38 in the post-bourse. Turnover fell from DM10.6bn to DM9.6bn. At the close the DAX was still nearly 85 points up on the week after a significant push from German mutual funds moving out of bonds into equities, and supported by US buying. The big winner of the day, the pharmaceuticals group, Schering, made its own breakthrough with a DM29.20 gain to DM1,022 on one big order, and then excitement that it had cleared the DM1,000 level. Other recent special situations like Daimler and Lufthansa were down again, by DM5.90 to DM747.80 and by DM2.40 to DM159.90 respectively. AMSTERDAM saw Hoogovens continuing to attract sellers as speculation persisted over its financial health, the shares ending off 90 cents at Fl 42.10. Many analysts believe that while the steel group remains in a difficult situation, its longer term prospects are relatively satisfactory. Goldman Sachs has the stock on its European priority list, although emphasising that earnings recovery 'is likely to be a bumpy ride'. The CBS Tendency index finished off 0.2 at 127.7. Nedlloyd featured among the day's gainers, up Fl 2.40 or nearly 6 per cent at Fl 43.80. Kleinwort Benson has issued a buy note on the transport group, based on 'significant changes in top management which. . .in the short to medium term will focus on debt reduction and cost cutting and should lead to a gradual allaying of fears over the group's weak financial position'. MILAN was enlivened by some late speculative buying of Ferruzzi on hopes that the rescue plan may soon be completed, but the Comit index shed 4.25 to 596.16 as the market's consolidation continued. Ferruzzi added L25.10 or 8.3 per cent to L325.30 and Montedison was L35.60 or 4.6 per cent higher at L801 ahead of the weekend meeting of creditor banks. Analysts were surprised by a L30 fall to L1,924 by Olivetti in heavy volume of 16.7m shares, noting that there was no news to account for the activity. On Wednesday, Merrill Lynch commented that in the short-term, the share price was reflecting expectations such as the probability of winning Italy's second cellular telephone licence, adding 'there is still scope for intermediate-term appreciation given the company's repositioning of itself'. Fiat group companies were lower: Fiat shed L169 to L6,003. ZURICH edged lower in fairly active trade, the SMI index easing 6.8 to 2,528.0. Roche and Sandoz were marked down after forecasts which analysts said were in line with expectations. Roche certificates shed SFr30 to SFr5,390, and Sandoz SFr60 to SFr3,440. Banks and insurers remained supported by hopes for lower interest rates. CS Holding bearers added SFr50 to SFr3,060, helped by Wednesday's cut in cash bond rates by Credit Suisse and Swiss Volksbank's plan to cut costs by closing branches. STOCKHOLM's Affarsvarlden general index ended a mere fraction below the all-time high of 1,339,1 it hit on August 18, closing 10.3 higher at 1,337.3. Domestic and international investors tended to focus on shares which had underperformed the earlier market rally. The household appliance maker, Electrolux, rose SKr7 to SKr259 and the mining and metals group, Trelleborg, by SKr4.50 to SKr45.50, helped by higher nickel prices.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- October 7 THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                          Open     11.30     12.00     13.00 FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1318.80   1317.92   1320.06   1321.34 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1402.72   1402.41   1403.44   1402.79                         14.00     15.00     16.00     Close FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1319.24   1318.25   1318.01   1317.76 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1403.38   1401.93   1400.47   1401.97  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Oct 6     Oct 5     Oct 4     Oct 1    Sep 30 FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1321.84   1313.91   1299.14   1293.99   1293.02 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1403.39   1391.47   1377.73   1368.19   1362.51  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90) High/day: 100 - 1321.34; 200 -  1405.44 Low/day: 100 - 1317.40 200 - 1399.17.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A FRENCH EXPORT;  </P> <P> COLLECTOR ADRIEN MAEGHT SAYS L.A.'S EMERGENCE AS A MAJOR ART CENTER LED HIM TO  CHOOSE BEVERLY HILLS AS THE SITE FOR A U.S. BRANCH OF HIS PARIS GALLERY.  </P> <P> A little of the Left Bank has opened on the Westside.  </P> <P> The new Benedicte Saxe Gallery in Beverly Hills is the first American branch of  Maeght Graphics, the French art publisher whose Paris gallery became world  famous for its posters and other graphics by Matisse and Miro, Calder and  Chagall.  </P> <P> At an opening soiree earlier this month, Adrien Maeght, the collector who heads  the French art empire, and Benedicte Saxe talked about their decision to settle  in Beverly Hills. It was a party that might have been in Paris -- except that  hardly anybody smoked.  </P> <P> In a prepared statement that smoothed out the rough edges of his English,  Maeght noted that the climate and landscape of Southern California are much  like that of Southern France, where his parents opened first a lithography shop  and later a gallery featuring the work of such friends as Miro, Kandinsky,  Chagall and Leger.  </P> <P> As the eldest son of a family of art collectors and patrons occasionally  compared to the Medicis, Maeght grew up among artists as well as thousands of  works of modern art.  </P> <P> Between bonsoirs and hellos at the opening event, Maeght recalled that Pierre  Bonnard helped him with his Latin homework as a child. Georges Braque was best  man at his wedding. And a laughing Maeght attributed his imperfect command of  English to a four-month stay in the United States in 1949. He spent most of the  time with artist Hans Hofmann, then living in Provincetown, Mass., who grew up  speaking German.  </P> <P> As a businessman, Maeght said he chose Los Angeles over New York, in part,  because the West Coast is so far from the firm's French operations. Serious  East Coast collectors can fly to Paris to see what the Maeght Gallery, or the  firm's new gallery for young artists near the Georges Pompidou Center, is  offering. Even more important, Maeght said, was the recent emergence of Los  Angeles as a major art center. "We thought it was the right time to come here."  </P> <P> Saxe, who has worked with Maeght in France for a decade, agreed. Saxe said she  had been coming to California for years, initially to visit relatives. She was  increasingly impressed with the art scene but said she believed the local  galleries had not yet caught up with the museums or the sophistication of  American art patrons.  </P> <P> "California museums are perfect," Saxe said. "Americans are perfect. But the  galleries are not perfect."  </P> <P> She told Maeght she was ready to "work for you, but alone" in Southern  California.  </P> <P> In looking for gallery space, Saxe considered but rejected such hot spots as  Santa Monica. Although Maeght continues to represent new artists, it has also  come to be identified with the cutting edge of an earlier era. Saxe decided she  didn't belong among the utterly contemporary galleries that seem to multiply  daily in several Westside neighborhoods.  </P> <P> "If I sold young painters, I would have to be in Venice or on Colorado  Boulevard," she said. "But now I am not avant-garde, I am classic."  </P> <P> Unlike Maeght's Paris galleries, which sell paintings as well as graphics, the  Beverly Hills operation sells mostly lithographs, etchings, art books and other  relatively affordable art graphics. New posters start at $20, but a visitor  could also take home a 1976 Miro lithograph, "Contrebalancee," for $58,000.  </P> <P> Saxe's rhetoric is populist, despite the presence in the gallery of two $30,000  Braque plates. "Art graphics are for everyone," she said. In California, Maeght  wants to cater to the person who loves art, not to the art speculator. "They  want to sell to the passionate people, not to the millionaire," she said.  </P> <P> But the passionate penniless don't pay the rent. Saxe said she chose Beverly  Hills because it attracts browsers who have educated tastes and enough money to  buy the lithograph, sometimes even the Braque plate, they fall in love with.  </P> <P> "I need rich people, classic people, people who go to the theater, to the  opera, who travel to Europe. I can't be far from them."  </P> <P> The gallery is at 434 N. Bedford Drive, not on Rodeo Drive, which she rejected  for aesthetic reasons and because of stratospheric rents.  </P> <P> Los Angeles' growing economic and cultural clout was a favorite topic at the  opening. Californiaphiles with French accents were everywhere. Gerard Coste,  the French consul in Los Angeles and himself a painter, pointed out that Maeght  was one of several French institutions that had recently invested in the city.  Christian Dior is another.  </P> <P> "New York is decaying, and there is no other center in the world ready to take  the challenge of New York," he said. "The European capitals of Paris, London,  Rome are interesting but not powerful enough to take the challenge. Tokyo is  very special, but they don't want to share their culture. I do believe Los  Angeles is going to become the metropolis of the world."  </P></p>

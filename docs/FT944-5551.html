			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / International Company News: IRI fixes bidding deadline for flat steel producer IRI, the Italian state holding company, has fixed a deadline of December 12 for potential buyers to present their bids for Ilva Laminati Pianti, the flat steel subsidiary of Italy's state-owned steel producer. IRI is attempting to strike a deal for ILP by the end of 1994. If it fails, Italy will fall foul of the European Commission, which has to enforce an EU agreement that Ilva should be fully privatised by December 31. Several companies have expressed interest in ILP, but with the EU deadline approaching it is still unclear how serious the possible buyers are. Mr Emilio Riva, the Italian steel magnate, has recently emerged as an ally of the Tarnofin consortium of entrepreneurs from the region around ILP's main plants. Unconfirmed reports in yesterday's Italian newspapers said the Riva group had replaced G. William Miller, the Washington-based merchant bank, in the consortium. Two Italian steel traders, Mr Bruno Bolfo and Mr Vittorio Malacalza, are trying to rally support for a separate offer. Their advisers say the traders have the backing of CSN, the Brazilian steel producer. They have also been seeking to add Usinor Sacilor of France and Lucchini, the private Italian steel manufacturer, to the consortium, and could make a formal offer next week. Following a board meeting yesterday, IRI said IMI, the bank which is advising the holding company on the sale, would communicate the December 12 deadline to 'all parties who have expressed concrete interest in the acquisition'. Capacity reductions and privatisation were the main conditions imposed on the Italian industry by EU ministers last year, in exchange for agreeing to a final injection of state aid for the loss-making producer. IRI has already agreed the sale of AST, the special steels division of Ilva, for L600bn (Dollars 37m), to an Italian-German consortium which includes Riva.</p>

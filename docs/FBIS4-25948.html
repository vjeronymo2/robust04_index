			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 15 (AFP) -- Chinese dissident Wang  Dan began a 48-hour hunger strike at his home here Wednesday to  protest police harrassment and the government's refusal to  democratise China's political system. "I have had enough of  being constantly watched in contempt of the law, and I want to  stand up for my rights," the former student leader of the 1989  pro-democracy movement said by telephone. He added that he was  also protesting the government's indifference to appeals from  the Chinese people for more democracy. A number of petitions  sent to the authorities by dissident groups. [sentence as  received]    Wang, 24, was freed in 1993 after spending four years in  prison. He said Tuesday that he would begin a fast unless the  police presence around him was removed by Wednesday night. He  said he feared for his safety, adding that two plain clothes  police followed him everywhere, and that four or five others  were stationed day and night in front of his building.    Wang returned here Sunday from the eastern province of  Shandong. He decided to leave the capital for the fifth  anniversary of the Tiananmen massacre on June 4, in order to  "avoid police harassment." At the end of May, the dissident  signed a petition with six other people, protesting the  treatment of those involved in the 1989 pro-democracy movement  and calling for the release of all those detained. A number of  petitions and open letters have been sent to the government this  year by dissidents and intellectuals pushing for more democracy.  But the government has responded by intensifying repression,  arresting many dissident leaders and putting others under  intense police surveillance.</p>

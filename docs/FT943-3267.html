			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Welcome for US banking bill Bank industry lobbyists in Washington breathed a sigh of relief yesterday after the Senate finally passed a bill to allow banks to set up branches more freely outside their home states. Sweeping aside last-minute objections to some of the miscellaneous provisions attached to the bill, the Senate voted 94-4 on Tuesday in favour of a measure that some of its backers had feared might once again get bogged down in the legislative process and expire without a vote before Congress breaks up next month to campaign for the November 8 elections. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury secretary, said the bill was 'a major step forward for the American banking system' that had been sought by the last four administrations. 'Interstate banking and branching will be beneficial to banks and their customers as well as the nation's economy as a whole. This bill will allow banks to reduce expenses by structuring themselves more efficiently,' Mr Bentsen said. Key points of the banking bill include: Bank holding companies may acquire a bank in any state, starting in one year. Banks in separate states may merge, from June 1 1997, unless either state has 'opted out' by passing a law to ban such interstate mergers. Banks could open new branches outside their home states only if states 'opt in' by passing a law to allow it. Foreign banks would have the same right to open new branches as US banks, whether they operate in the US through a separate subsidiary or through a direct branch from their home country. But foreign banks could be required to establish a subsidiary if US bank regulators deem it necessary to verify their capital adequacy. A separate measure would extend the statute of limitations to allow the federal regulators to revive claims against officials of failed savings and loans or banks in cases of egregious fraud or intentional misconduct, but not of simple negligence. Over the past 15 years, the state-by-state compartmentalisation of the US banking system has gradually broken down. Only a handful of states still forbid any acquisition of their banks by out-of-state bank holding companies. At the same time, the inconveniences for customers have diminished as nationwide cash machine networks allow consumers to withdraw cash when they leave their home state. But much of the consolidation has been regional, and banks currently do not accept deposits across state lines - even from customers of their own affiliates. For example, someone who works in Washington DC but lives in the Maryland suburbs is not allowed to deposit a pay cheque in a Washington branch of Riggs Bank, even though he or she has an account at Riggs in Maryland.</p>

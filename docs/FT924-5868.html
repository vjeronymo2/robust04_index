			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Fresh blow to Crawley as Hughes Rediffusion cuts 600 jobs ANOTHER 600 people are to lose their jobs at Hughes Rediffusion Simulation, the US-owned flight simulator manufacturer based at Crawley, West Sussex. The announcement deals a fresh blow to the town, which prospered in the 1980s as nearby Gatwick airport expanded but which has now been badly hit by the recession. Last year, 800 local jobs were lost with the collapse of Air Europe and now 1,400 jobs are going with the merger of Dan-Air and British Airways. Hundreds of jobs in related businesses operating locally are under threat. The recession also claimed another 500 jobs yesterday when Shell UK announced redundancies at its Stanlow refinery in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire. Hughes Rediffusion, experiencing lower orders from civilian and military customers, has already made about 1,000 workers redundant over the past two years. The latest job cuts, involving about a third of the remaining workforce, follows an announcement in April when the company integrated five satellite factories in the south-east into its Crawley complex. Mr Peter Quast, managing director of Hughes Rediffusion, said he deeply regretted further job losses but the company had to emerge from the recession better organised, more efficient and with a clear strategy for long-term growth. The company's simulators, which sell for between Pounds 5m and Pounds 7m each, are purchased by most of the world's leading airlines, which have reduced the size of aircraft fleets and training programmes in the face of the recession. Military customers, who buy machines simulating high-speed combat conditions, are also reducing budgets in the wake of the end of the cold war. UK-based competitors of Hughes Rediffusion have also been forced to make cuts in their workforces. Hughes Rediffusion is part of Los Angeles-based Hughes Aircraft, itself a subsidiary of General Motors Hughes Electronics. Shell job cuts, Page 8</p>

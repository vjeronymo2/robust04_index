			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Futures trading firm fined Pounds 21,600 The International Petroleum Exchange yesterday fined GNI, a commodities and futures firm, Pounds 21,600. The exchange said it had found breaches of its rules and procedures after investigating trades by GNI staff and Mr Michael Angel, who trades on the floor of the exchange on his own account. The breaches included executing a number of trades other than by open outcry, failing to register or properly execute a number of cross-trades and two instances of trading away from the market price, thereby abusing a client order. Mr Angel was fined Pounds 10,450 and suspended for one month. One of the directors of GNI is Mr Christopher Sharples, who is chairman of the Securities and Futures Authority, the self-regulating body for the securities industry.</p>

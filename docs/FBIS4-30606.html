			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 28 KYODO -- Outgoing Prime Minister  Tsutomu Hata on Tuesday [28 June] called for extending the  current parliamentary session beyond its deadline of Wednesday  to enable the Diet to pick a new prime minister.    "It is inconceivable that the Diet should end its session  before a new cabinet has been formed," said Hata, who announced  Saturday his intention to resign along with his entire cabinet.  Hata remains in office until his replacement is picked.    Hata made the comments as his ruling coalition is stepping  up  its bid to woo the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [SDPJ -- Social  Democratic Party of Japan] back into its fold to create a  stable, majority government.    The House of Representatives is to convene a plenary session  at 10 a.m. Wednesday.    However, it remains unclear whether the lower chamber will  be  able to vote on a successor to Hata on Wednesday in view of  intensifying parliamentary maneuverings by both the coalition  and the no. 1 opposition Liberal Democratic Party to win over  the socialists to their respective camps.    A source at the lower house's Diet steering committee, "it  is  in line with common sense that we should extend the Diet session  by about a week until the second week of July, while seeking to  pick a successor before the Naples Summit begins (July 8)."    Some LDP executives are trying to form a new coalition  government comprising the LDP, SDP and new party Sakigake by  forcing a vote during Wednesday's Diet session, while preventing  the coalition from buying time to convince the SDP to return to  its fold, Diet sources said.    "The coalition would not be able to extend the Diet if the  LDP and SDP, which contains the proponents of an SDP-LDP  alliance, jointly opposes such an extension," the source said.    In such an eventuality, the Diet would be forced to close  its  session temporarily and then hold an extraordinary session to  pick a new premier and approve a bill defining the new 300  single-seat constituencies, the sources said.</p>

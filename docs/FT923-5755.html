			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Venomous twist in Milan scandal SHARP differences have emerged within Italy's Socialist party following a number of bitter attacks in Avanti, the party newspaper, on the Milanese judges investigating the city's corruption scandal. It is widely believed that the attacks have been inspired by Mr Bettino Craxi, the Socialist party leader. The Socialists have held sway in Milan, Mr Craxi's personal power-base, almost uninterruptedly since the war, and have been badly tainted by the scandal. Leaked extracts from statements by some local politicians under investigation have dented Mr Craxi's claims to have been unaware of the widespread practice of kickbacks and undercover funding for the city's main political parties. The increasingly personal broadsides, written anonymously, have focused on Mr Antonio Di Pietro, the best-known of the magistrates conducting the inquiries. Amid veiled allusions to a less than honourable past, the paper has suggested that, in time, Mr Di Pietro would be revealed to be 'very different from the hero talked about'. The personal tone and insinuations of the Avanti articles could prove counter-productive. This week, Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, Italy's Socialist environment minister and a former European Commissioner, wrote an open letter to Mr Di Pietro, dissociating himself from the articles. Mr Giacomo Mancini, a veteran party leader, has also come out strongly against the paper, as have a number of prominent Socialist mayors. More than 70 people, mainly politicians, have so far been arrested. But rumours of the impending arrest of leading businessmen and politicians continue to grip the city. On Wednesday, shares in Mediobanca, the powerful merchant bank, were marked down sharply after conflicting reports of the death, or arrest, of Mr Enrico Cuccia, its octogenarian honorary chairman, though the rumour was swiftly denied. On the same day Italy's constitutional court turned down an appeal for the release of Mr Salvatore Ligresti, the Sicilian-born property magnate in Milan's San Vittore prison for over a month.</p>

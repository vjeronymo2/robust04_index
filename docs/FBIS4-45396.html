The half-hour meeting took place in U.S. Ambassador  Pamela Harriman's residence in the rue du Faubourg St. Honore.  The mayor of Paris was accompanied by Didier Quentin, the  town's international relations director, and Pierre Lellouche,  his foreign policy and defense adviser. Bill Clinton's  entourage included U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher  and Thomas McLarty, chief of the presidential staff. Jacques  Chirac and Bill Clinton spent most of the meeting discussing  international affairs, and in particular the Bosnian conflict.  On this issue, they were agreed that the arms embargo should  not be lifted. The RPR president also insisted on the  seriousness of the situation in Algeria, which risks  destabilizing the whole Maghreb region. Where nuclear testing  is concerned, Jacques Chirac stressed the need for France to  carry out a few more tests before switching over to test  simulations. For his part, Bill Clinton expressed his concern  about the growing risk of the proliferation of weapons of mass  destruction (nuclear, chemical, and bacteriological) and the  danger that this represents, insofar as they could be used by  terrorist groups.  <H5>  Working Group </H5>   Moreover, Jacques Chirac explained at length to the U.S.  President his views on the urgent and vital need to attack the  narcotics problem at the production stage. In particular, he  stressed the considerable increase in the production of heroin  and its consequences, especially for young people.    The former French prime minister also underscored the need  to  define a policy and take action, possibly under the aegis of the  United Nations, to encourage countries producing narcotics to  think about promoting alternative sources of revenue for their  farmers.    President Clinton showed much interest in this proposal. The  two men decided that regular contacts would be established  between experts on both sides and that a working group would be  set up to define a policy for the fight against narcotics  production.</p>

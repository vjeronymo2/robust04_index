			<p>BFN     [Text] Ndjamena, May 12 (AFP) -- The government of Chad,  beset with a host of regional rebel movements, has created a  national reconciliation committee in a bid to secure a lasting  peace with its armed opposition, officials said Thursday [12  May].    The 12-member committee was created by a governmental  decree,  apparently overriding what informed sources said was resistance  by Chad's warlord President Idriss Deby to the formation of any  such body. The decree charged the new commitee with "forming  contacts and opening dialogue in the country's interior and  negotiating with political-military groups."    The 12-member body has two representatives from the  government, two from the provisional parliament known as the  Higher Transitional Council (CST), two from political parties,  two from human rights associations and four other well-known  figures.    The National Sovereign Conference, a body of various  political and interest groups set up to chart a new democratic  constitution and set up an interim government, urged formation  of a reconciliation committee when it closed work in April 1993.    The main armed rebel movements targeted are the National  Salvation Committee for Peace and Democracy in the south, the  Chad National Front in the east and the Movement for Democracy  and Development in the area of Lake Chad.    According to former prime minister Fidel Moungar, who was  chosen by the National Sovereign Conference but later ousted by  the provisional parliament, Deby wanted to handle rebel matters  his own way and long resisted forming any reconciliation  committee.    But Moungar noted that the return to Ndjamena of former  dissident leader Abbas Koty had been negotiated by aides close  to Colonel Deby without any involvement by the government and  Koty ended up being killed last October at the time of his  arrest.    The government finally went ahead with the committee's  creation after its negotiations with the National Salvation  Commitee in Bangui in February broke down.</p>

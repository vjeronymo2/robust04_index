			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Sparks fly over attempt to break power barrier: Judy Dempsey on a German town's move to buy its electricity from across the border Mr Manfred Palman, financial director of the small German city of Kleve on the Dutch border, needs no prompting to recall the two most important events in the city's modern history: the Allied bombing on October 7, 1944, and the contract made in 1910 between Kleve and RWE Energie, Germany's largest utility, to supply its inhabitants with electricity. Fifty years on, though, the bombing seems to have had less impact than the contract. 'The Allies bombed 91 per cent of our city, but we have since rebuilt it. RWE has monopolised our electricity supply since the early 1900s. But now we want to end that contract,' said Mr Palman. Ironically, the British may be his best hope of doing that. Mr Palman hopes Britain, and some other countries of the European Union, will support a decision by Kleve to end the contract with RWE and buy its energy from the neighbouring Netherlands. This decision is supported by Germany's cartel office which has referred the question to the Brussels competition authorities. 'The EU wants to use Kleve as a test case. We must win because this will be the beginning of the end of the large energy monopolies in Germany,' said Mr Palman. 'It will usher in an era of competition and choice for the consumer.' That would be a significant departure for Europe's electricity supply industry in general and for Germany in particular. The battle for the future control of the supply and distribution of energy is one of Germany's hottest political issues - a great deal of power and money is at stake. In every German city or town Stadtwerke, or city utilities, are responsible for supplying electricity, gas and water to the local industrial and domestic consumers. The Stadtwerke, owned by city councils, have a long tradition, however, of issuing exclusive 'concession rights', or contracts, to Germany's largest utilities. To obtain these exclusive concessions, the utility companies pay the Stadtwerke an annual fee. 'In the case of Kleve, RWE pays us DM3.5m (Pounds 1.5m) each year,' said Mr Palman. Kleve consumes 210m kilowatt hours each year at a cost of DM45m-DM50m (Pounds 19m-Pounds 21m). 'Our domestic consumers pay 14.7 pfennigs per kilowatt hour,' said Mr Palman. 'But we think we can obtain energy from the Netherlands for 2 pfennigs cheaper. The problem is that, as yet, there is no link between Kleve and a Dutch supplier,' he added. Indeed, if Kleve were to go further afield, says Mr Palman, the city might be able to obtain nuclear generated power from France for about 8 pfennigs per kilowatt hour. 'But because there is no German law permitting third party access (TPA), which, in our case, would allow any outside company access to the RWE grid at Kleve, we are entirely dependent on this monopoly structure with RWE.' The dispute between the company and Kleve's city council - controlled by Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats in coalition with the Free Democrats - has national political implications because it coincides with attempts by Mr Gunther Rexrodt, the FDP economics minister, to deregulate Germany's energy sector. Germany currently holds the European Union presidency and Mr Rexrodt is trying to introduce EU legislation aimed at introducing TPA throughout the Union. To no-one's surprise, his plans are floundering. Britain, which supports TPA, has backed him, but France, with one of the EU's jealously guarded energy structures, has opposed any plans for liberalisation. More importantly, utility officials say that since France will assume the EU presidency next January, Mr Kohl is unwilling to support his minister for fear of upsetting Franco-German relations. The chancellor is also reluctant to push for TPA until after October's federal elections. The Stadtwerke, too, are hoping the next government will not upset the comfortable status quo. Most of them oppose liberalisation for a variety of reasons. Those councils controlled by the opposition Social Democratic party fear deregulation would adversely affect the coal industry, traditional SPD supporters, and eventually lead to the phasing out of coal subsidies. Each tonne of German-produced coal receives a subsidy of DM200m to offset cheap imports. In addition, said an official from the Federal Association for Gas and Water, 'the introduction of TPA would mean that the Stadtwerke would lose at least DM5bn each year from concession rights fees. No wonder the finance ministry is also against TPA. It would have to fork out more money to the local councils.' Above all, TPA would mean the loss of political favours for the Stadtwerke. 'Germany's utilities are adept at offering more besides energy when they pay the annual concession fee,' claimed the same official. 'Its a kind of political patronage. Don't forget that members of the Stadtwerke are also members of the city councils, who in turn have close political ties with the state governments. The councils need money to run their campaigns and prove their track record. Where do you think the money for a new swimming pool comes from?' Mr Palman has little patience with this kind of political clientalism which has evolved over the decades between the Stadtwerke, the utilities, the city councils and the states. 'We want choice and competition. If we can obtain cheaper energy from other sources we should have the right to do that.' Germany's utilities, for their part, say they have 'in principle' nothing against TPA. 'We are not opposed to competition provided TPA is based on reciprocity, which means that we would be able to sell and distribute our energy in France,' said an RWE official. But back in Kleve, Mr Palman knows that without a political consensus in Bonn ready to take on the Stadtwerke and utilities, or unity in the EU, the city's inhabitants will have to wait some time for their Dutch electricity.</p>

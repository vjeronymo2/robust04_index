			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The United States gave Somalia weapons that were used to viciously quell an  insurgency, then provided disaster assistance to the victims the next month,  the General Accounting Office reported. The congressional watchdog agency found  that a $1.4-million U.S. shipment of M-16 automatic rifles and 2.3 million  rounds of ammunition arrived in Somalia in June, 1988, just as the army  launched massive artillery and aerial shellings to crush a rebellion in the  north. Then, "starting in August, 1988, the U.S. government responded to the  emergency with $1.9 million in disaster assistance to help the victims of the  conflict," the GAO report said. Since the attacks, the Administration has  suspended further weapons deliveries.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 16 KYODO -- Political powerbroker Ichiro  Ozawa called on the ruling coalition on Monday [16 May] to have  confidence in its mission while rejecting proposals to permit  the return of the maverick Social Democratic Party to the fold.    In a speech in Chiba, the Shinseito secretary general  rejected any plans to do away with the intraparliamentary group  "Kaishin (Innovation)" if it would entice the return of the  second largest opposition party, which bolted from the coalition  last month.    "The ruling party must have this kind of confidence. We must  be able to have confidence in our ideals and answer the  expectations of the people," said Ozawa, the acknowledged  architect of the ruling minority coalition.    Earlier Monday, Takashi Yonezawa, secretary general of the  Democratic Socialist Party, and Japan New Party executive Masao  Matsuoka suggested the ruling coalition would be willing to  withdraw plans for "Kaishin" if it would entice the return of  the SDP.    Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata will formally inform SDP  Chairman  Tomiichi Murayama on Tuesday of the suggestion and urge the SDP  to rejoin the coalition.    The SDP, however, has charged that there is still an  "authoritarian character" to the current coalition and denied  that there was any possibility of a return of the SDP to the  ruling force.    The SDP withdrew from the ruling coalition only hours after  it had helped elect Tsutomu Hata premier, upset by maneuvers by  other coalition parties to form the new political alignment  without the party.    Ozawa warned that in the event of general elections, the  largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party would win by a  landslide and that the "only other survivor would be Shinseito."    "We must not think only of the advantages before us and turn  left or turn right. The socialists and Komeito were with us  when we decided to proceed and we must think about achieving an  historically great achievement," urged Ozawa.    Ozawa dismissed suggestions by murayama and new party  Sakigake leader Masayoshi Takemura that the House of  Representatives be dissolved for elections under the current  electoral system.    "That is only the talk of people who do not have the right  to  decide on the dissolution. The cabinet will make that  decision," said Ozawa.</p>

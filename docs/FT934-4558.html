			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Watchdog increases pressure on BT profits Regulatory pressure on British Telecommunications to cut its prices and profits appears likely to increase sharply if interest rates remain low, following a policy statement yesterday by Oftel, the telecommunications regulator. The prospect was raised by Oftel's settlement of a long-running dispute between BT and Mercury, its main UK competitor, over charges paid by Mercury for the use of BT's network to deliver calls to their destinations. By reducing interconnection prices paid by Mercury, Oftel's determination will further boost competition in the UK telecommunications market. The settlement is worth at least Pounds 60m to Mercury this year in lower prices and back payments. In reaching its decision Oftel sharply cut the rate of return on capital it allows BT. When setting BT's current price cap in June 1992 Oftel allowed BT a return on capital of between 16.5 per cent and 18.5 per cent. In yesterday's Mercury determination it cut the figure to 15 per cent, citing lower interest rates. BT's price formula, setting average price rises at 7.5 percentage points below the rate of inflation each year, is to be reviewed in 1996. Robert Fleming, the brokers, estimated that applying the reduced rate of return to BT's existing price cap would have cut this year's pre-tax profits by about Pounds 300m, around 10 per cent. Mr Laurence Heyworth, Fleming's telecoms analyst, said: 'BT faces a very tough negotiation with the regulator over its next price cap.' BT said the new rate of return was 'lower than we think reasonable', but said it did not necessarily follow that the same figure would be used for the next price cap, even if inflation stayed low. Mr Mike Harris, Mercury chief executive, described the Oftel determination as a 'curate's egg'. He welcomed the reduced charges but not the obligation imposed by Oftel to pay BT a special contribution to help cover the cost of maintaining line rental and connection charges at an artificially low level. Oftel ruled that Mercury would have to pay the 'access deficit contributions' when it gained more than 10 per cent of the market for either international or domestic calls, with a sharp rise in the level of payments when it reached 25 per cent of either market. By March Mercury had 19 per cent of the market for international calls and 7 per cent for domestic calls, so it will have to pay BT contributions for its international traffic. Inter-connecting payments to BT are Mercury's largest outgoing. With operating profits of Pounds 192m last year, the ruling will significantly improve its financial performance this year. The company intends to use Pounds 9m of the proceeds to fund experiments in using radio technology to bypass BT by providing local networks for fixed phones.</p>

			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Building inquiries point to upturn Inquiries for new construction work have risen for the first time in almost five years, says a survey by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors published today. According to the institution, inquiries for work at 200 quantity surveying firms rose by 2.5 per cent during the three months to the end of March compared with the previous three months. Much quantity surveying work occurs early in the construction process when costings are provided for contracts. Their order books, therefore, provide a good indicator of future workloads. Mr Christopher Vickers, a senior partner at EC Harris, one of the largest firms of quantity surveyors, said: 'At last the industry's fortunes are beginning to change. We are seeing a return of client confidence and interest but what we need now is commitment. 'If the improved activity in feasibility work feeds through to actual projects then we can expect to see a steady upturn in workload over the next six to nine months.' Workloads fell by 9.5 per cent during the 12 months to the end of March. Two-thirds of quantity surveyors, however, expect to increase output during the next 12 months and 30 per cent of firms expect to increase staffing. According to the survey, private housing workloads are continuing to increase while there has also been a small increase in commercial work reflecting the recent improvement in commercial property yields. Workloads in the industrial sector have also stabilised. Public-sector housing work, however, has declined, reflecting pressure on government spending.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia's Defence Ministry incurred a debt of 6  trillion rubles to munitions producers and army personnel over  the first five months of the year. As a senior ministry  official told Interfax on Wednesday, the department was  underpaid 4.9 trillion rubles out of the federal budget.    In his words, the army has turned into a large debtor. There  have been more and more conflicts when due to debt problems  bakeries have denied bread to army units and municipalities have  threatened to stop electricity supply. The military, he noted,  have been trying to prevent this by exerting pressure on local  officials with tanks and otherwise. He had in mind cases when  the command of a unit sent military vehicles to local government  premises to bully officials there.    He doubts that the 37.1 trillion ruble budget, endorsed by  the Duma after the first hearing, will help to reform the armed  forces and bring Russian troops back home.    "Those who insist on that figure, are energetically pushing  the army to the line beyond which there come irreversible  consequences, catastrophe and chaos", the official declared.  Nor, in his view, could the 55 trillion ruble military budget  supported by President Yeltsin solve all the problems facing the  armed forces, even though it would help to keep the country's  defence potential intact.    He disclosed that the commander of an army platoon got a  meagre monthly pay of 200,000 rubles (about 100 dollars). The  pilot of a supersonic military jet earns 440 thousand rubles  (220 dollars), whereas his civilian counterpart makes more than  1.5 million rubles (1500 dollars).</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Set forth below, pursuant to SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.15 and 732.17 are the Director's findings concerning the proposed amendment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Revisions not specifically discussed below concern nonsubstantive wording changes, or revised cross-references and paragraph notations to reflect organizational changes resulting from this amendment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Section 480&hyph;03&hyph;19.816/817.49(a)(3) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Virginia proposes to add new stability design requirements at &sect;480&hyph;03&hyph;19.816/817.49(a)(3)(ii) for impoundments not meeting the size or other criteria of 30 CFR 77.216(a), except for a coal mine waste impounding structure. The impoundments, located where failure would not be expected to result in loss of life or serious property damage, shall have a minimum static safety factor of 1.3 for a normal pool with steady state seepage saturation conditions. These proposed provisions are substantively identical to the Federal rule at 30 CFR 816/817.49(a)(3)(ii). The amendment further provides for use of earth embankments whose top widths are no less than 10 feet and whose embankment slopes are 2h:1v or flatter, provided the permittee documents that a minimum static safety factor of 1.3 can be met using the graphical solution methods outlined in the ``Bureau of Mines Report of Investigations/1981, RI 8564, Factor of Safety Charts for Estimating the Stability of Saturated and Unsaturated Tailings Pond Embankments, United States Department of the Interior.'' By letter dated February 23, 1994 (Administrative Record No. VA&hyph;836), OSM advised Virginia that the graphical solution methods could be used in lieu of engineering tests, for low hazard impoundments not meeting the size or other criteria of 30 CFR 77.216(a) if all the appropriate parameters needed to use the graphs in RI 8564 are adequately documented for each embankment. OSM pointed out that the appropriate parameters included: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _Unit weight of the soil <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Height of the embankment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Internal friction angle <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Cohesion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Pore pressure ratio <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Slope of the embankment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Depth factor <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to satisfying these parameter requirements, OSM stated that the embankment would have to be constructed of homogeneous material and the stiff base under the foundation must be flat. By letter dated March 16, 1994 (Administrative Record No. VA&hyph;837), Virginia agreed that the parameters set forth in OSM's letter of February 23, 1994, will be required by the State for use with the graphs in RI 8564 and that the parameters must be documented for each embankment. Virginia further agreed that the embankment will be required to be constructed of homogeneous material and the stiff base under the foundation will be required to be flat. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816/817.49(a)(3)(ii), 780.25(c)(3) and 784.16(c)(3) provide for an alternative to engineering tests that establish for impoundments a minimum static safety factor of 1.3. If a State regulatory authority, through the State program amendment process, can establish engineering design standards that ensure stability comparable to the 1.3 minimum static safety factor, then such design standards are no less effective than 816/817.49(a)(3)(ii). The Director has determined that the proposed amendment to the Virginia regulations at &sect;VR 480.03.19.816/817.49(a)(3)(ii), as clarified by Virginia on March 16, 1994, ensures stability comparable to the 1.3 minimum static safety factor and is no less effective than the Federal rules at 30 CFR 816/817.49(a)(3)(ii). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Section VR 480&hyph;03&hyph;19.816/817.116(b)(3) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Virginia proposes to revise &sect;VR 480&hyph;03&hyph;19.816/817.116(b)(3)(v)(A) regarding the stocking of trees, shrubs, half-shrubs, and the ground cover established on the revegetated area where woody plants are used for wildlife management, recreation, shelter belts, or forest uses other than commercial forest land, by deleting the phrase ``approximate the stocking and ground cover on the surrounding unmined area.'' The Director finds the deleted language to be duplicative of requirements already found in the Virginia program. Therefore, the proposed deletion will not render Virginia's regulations less effective than the Federal requirements at 30 CFR 816.116(b)(3). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Section VR 480&hyph;03&hyph;19.816/817.116(c)(3) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Virginia proposed to revise these subsections by deleting the term ``conservation'' and replacing that term with the term ``husbandry.'' In its submittal of this amendment Virginia stated that the wording change was made to make the language consistent with the counterpart Federal provisions at 30 CFR 816/817.116(c)(4). In addition to the proposed wording change, Virginia submitted administrative record information containing a list of normal husbandry practices and related reference materials intended to support the practices identified by Virginia as normal husbandry practices. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816/817.116(c)(4) allow State regulatory authorities to select certain husbandry practices that will not extend the period of responsibility for successful revegetation and the bond liability of the permittee. These practices must be expected to continue as part of the postmining land use or that after discontinuance, the likelihood of permanent success is not reduced. Such practices must be submitted through the State program amendment process and must be approved by OSM before the State can implement such practices. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Upon review of the materials provided by Virginia, OSM determined that there was no document establishing the list of practices as Virginia policy. In addition, there was no information explaining how the lists and technical references would be used. In a letter to Virginia dated February 23, 1994 (Administrative Record No. VA&hyph;836), OSM addressed its concerns with the proposed husbandry practices amendment. Virginia responded by letter dated May 12, 1994 (Administrative Record No. VA&hyph;838). The State provided the following clarification. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

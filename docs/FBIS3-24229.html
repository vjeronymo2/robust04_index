			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Mikhail Poltoranin, chairman of </F> the mass media (SMI) committee of the State Duma, by Maxim  Shabalin, Moscow, under the "At First Hand" rubric; date not  given: "The Audience Should Know"]    [Text] [Poltoranin] Today's campaign against the State Duma  in the mass media is nothing other than an echo of the former  war between the first and fourth branch of power that was waged  in the summer and autumn of last year. I think that in order to  overcome this situation, we have tactical and strategic steps in  reserve. I would relate to the tactical the fact that we first  of all need a press center that feeds information to all of our  newspapers and to our television.    As for the strategic directions, they, in my view, are  these:  Of course, you cannot take the mass media by assault and frontal  attacks. The previous Supreme Soviet tried to do this, but this  attempt was not crowned with success. The powerful structures  also did not succeed in tearing off their own "Parliamentary  Hour" piece by piece. This tactic is futile.    It is nonsense that the government--one of the branches of  power--today monopolizes all state mass media as an instrument  of public control over this very power. Therefore, we must  correct the condition legislatively and create the kind of  situation where the mass media works objectively, and no one  interferes with it.    We intend tomorrow to submit the draft of a federal law for  review by the State Duma concerning the procedure for  elucidating in the state mass media the activity of the higher  organs of authority of the Russian Federation.    [Shabalin] The problems about which you are talking are  associated directly with articles of the law adopted by the  Supreme Soviet, which, however, the president suspended....    [Poltoranin] The president suspended a lot of laws and many  legislative acts. Committees (including ours also) will conduct  an inventory of everything that has been suspended and will  submit the question for Duma review. The mass media is an  important force, the fourth branch of power, and we must do  everything so that the press should cooperate with the State  Duma. As for specific proposals and the adoption of decisions  about renewing the transmission of "600 Seconds," etc.--these  are not functions of the Duma. There is a separation of powers  according to the new Constitution, there is a law on the mass  media, and there are such structures as, for example, the  television company "Sankt-Peterburg--Channel 5." There are also  such substructures as "600 Seconds." This is their business, and  not that of the State Duma: to produce or not to produce. Our  business is to create the kind of law so that there would be no  barriers for one or another television program or for articles  in newspapers.    [Shabalin] But in contrast to the former Supreme Soviet, the  Federal Assembly, from a political standpoint, is quite  heterogeneous. In accordance with your draft laws, will access  to the airwaves be offered to all factions?    [Poltoranin] Unquestionably, this will be reflected in the  draft law on the procedure for elucidating the work of the  higher organs of authority in the state mass media. I do not  think that the resumption of the "Parliamentary Hour" will  aggravate the situation. On the other hand, conducting this  program in the form in which it came out has no future. I assure  you: By no means everyone watched this "Parliamentary Hour."  Therefore, it is necessary for us to acquire air time to  illuminate the work of the State Duma, both on the first and  second Ostankino channels, and on the St. Petersburg channel,  and, it is quite natural, on the channels of the 80 regional  television companies that today live on the federal budget. This  is the objective. The entire population of Russia must be  informed of our work.</p>

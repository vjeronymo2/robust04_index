			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Cable TV deal must be rewritten The US Justice Department yesterday flexed its antitrust muscles by forcing changes in deals in the telecommunications and chemicals sectors. Officials said BellSouth, the US's largest local telephone company, had agreed to restructure its Dollars 250m deal to take a 22.5 per cent stake in Prime Cable, a cable TV operator, so that it would exclude any share of cable systems in markets where it already provides telephone service. At the same time, the department said it had agreed a settlement with Bayer, the German chemicals company, and S C Johnson, the US household products group, blocking an exclusive licensing deal for a Bayer insecticide that government lawyers feared would hurt competition in the insecticide market. Johnson, which has a 45-60 per cent share of the household insecticide market, had persuaded Bayer in 1988 not to enter the US market but instead to license cyfluthrin, a new insecticide ingredient that lasted much longer than previously available compounds, exclusively to them. Under a consent decree filed yesterday in Rockford, Illinois, Johnson and Bayer agreed to refrain from dividing up territories for insecticides. Bayer is required to license cyfluthrin to competing manufacturers on reasonable terms. 'The cozy arrangement that Bayer and Johnson maintained is unacceptable in a highly concentrated market such as the one for household insecticides,' said Mrs Anne Bingaman, assistant attorney general in charge of the antitrust division. The action echoes the Justice Department's recent moves against Pilkington, the UK plate glass company, for licensing arrangements that it found to be anticompetitive. Under the restructured cable deal Prime will drop cable systems in Atlanta and in Hickory, North Carolina, from its arrangement with BellSouth. The latter will be able to own cable systems in Las Vegas, Chicago and some areas of Texas and Alaska, outside its telephone service area.</p>

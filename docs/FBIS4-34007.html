			<p>BFN     [Text] Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), 14 Jun (EFE) -- In  his speech to the Fourth Ibero-American Summit today, Salvadoran  President Armando Calderon Sol called for the formation of a  "common front to defend our legitimate right to development."    Calderon, who assumed the presidency of his country on 1  June  and is participating in this forum for the first time, advocated  the strengthening of representative democracy and the promotion  of human rights and economic and social development as the  Ibero-American community's "major objectives." The Salvadoran  president pointed out that they would be able to attain the  Ibero-American peoples' aspirations of "living in peace,  liberty, and with greater opportunities" once such conditions  are attained.    He observed that almost all the countries in Ibero-America  enjoy democracy and added that "well-defined and concrete  measures and actions," which conform to the current  international economic trends, must be taken to confront the  challenges posed by commerce, integration, and development. In  this sense, he stressed, ways must be found to include regional  economies in the international sphere, especially after the GATT  Uruguay Round which will allow the opening of new markets for  developing countries.    As with the Central American presidents who spoke before  him,  the Salvadoran highlighted the "feasible development"  [desarrollo sostenible] program implemented by the Isthmian  countries. This program ties economic growth to respect for the  environment and social problems for the people which, according  to the Salvadoran president, requires "pragmatic policies." The  struggle for development, he asserted, is not circumscribed to  the liberalization of commerce but to the promotion of  integration as a response to the international challenges.    The program has made noteworthy progress in Central America  since the Central American Integration System was created in  1991. This organization comprises a region where peace,  liberty, and democracy have been consolidated. "However, we  must admit the tasks we have set out to achieve are challenged  by the difficulties inherent to our condition as a developing  nation," he added.    Calderon concluded by calling on the countries to take  advantage of the historic, ethnic, and cultural ties binding the  participating nations and to redouble their efforts for the  "possible creation of the Ibero-American Community of Nations."</p>

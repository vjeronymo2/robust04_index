			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: South African smelter decision delayed FINAL APPROVAL for the world's biggest aluminium smelter, a Dollars 2bn, 466,000-tonnes-a-year plant proposed for Richards Bay, South Africa, has been delayed for three months. Shareholders in Alusaf, South Africa's only primary aluminium producer, which hopes to build the smelter in Natal, are taking longer than expected to make up their minds whether to commit themselves to the huge investment. Also Alusaf has still to win environmental approval for the smelter, which faces strong opposition from some Richards Bay residents. Mr Theodor Tschopp, chairman of Alusuisse, one of Alusaf's shareholders, said that pressure to get the project started had 'cooled down' and that 'the whole issue is still open'. Some analysts suggest that Alusaf might opt instead to expand its existing smelter from 170,000 tonnes to about 220,000 tonnes. However, Mr Rob Barbour, Alusaf's managing director, said yesterday he remained 'quietly confident' that the project would be given the go-ahead at the end of this year. Then it would take three years to bring the smelter, to be built using technology supplied by Pechiney of France, into production. Mr Barbour said he had been too optimistic when he thought that Alusaf's shareholders - which also include Gencor (General Union Mining Corporation) and the Industrial Development Corporation of South Africa - would have made their decisions by this month, particularly in the light of present political turmoil in South Africa and the aluminium market's severe problems. He said that Alusaf did not wish to finance the smelter with a high proportion of debt, 50 per cent was the absolute maximum, so shareholders would have to put up perhaps Dollars 1bn of new equity. Analysts suggest that Alusuisse, which has reduced already its 22 per cent shareholding in Alusaf to 15 per cent, will not want to put any more money into Alusaf. However, Mr Tschopp said no decision had yet been made and he pointed out that the project might 'give us access to the cheapest aluminium'. Mr Barbour said Alusaf was not banking on Alusuisse putting in more money and funding could go ahead without the European group. The project sprang from Alusaf's ability to win a favourable 25-year electricity supply contract from Eskom, the South African utility, under which the tariff will be linked to the world aluminium price. This is not new in the industry but what probably is unique is that the contract sets no floor or ceiling prices. Eskom may also take a 25 per cent shareholding in the venture. Mr Fred Roux, managing director of Gencor's minerals division, said the smelter delay was partly because Eskom had still to decide whether to take up its equity option. 'It would make funding easier it Eskom comes in,' he pointed out. Gencor and IDC both had access to funds for the project, however, and 'I am confident we will have the go-ahead by November 1. That's three months later than expected, said Mr Roux. The environmental issue had also caused some delay. Alusaf's Mr Barbour said it was true that 'strong concern' had been expressed that the lowest-cost site near the harbour was too close to a residential area. However, Alusaf was looking at a back-up (but higher-cost) site which would satisfy all objections. A draft environmental impact study would be ready in mid-October for final comment by the public, he said. Comalco of Australia is to decide before the end of this year whether to expand annual capacity at its Boyne Island aluminium smelter in Queensland from 230,000 to 460,000 tonnes at an estimated cost of ADollars 880m. If it decides to go ahead, a consortium in which Comalco will have between 20 and 25 per cent will buy the nearby Gladstone power station from the Queensland state government for ADollars 750m. Analysts suggest that, if these arrangements are completed, expansion of Comalco's 79 per cent-owned Tiwai Point aluminium smelter in New Zealand will be less likely and questions will be raised about the future of the Bell Bay smelter in Tasmania. Cracking anodes have delayed start-up of the Deschambault aluminium smelter in Quebec owned by Amax, the US natural resources group, for about 60 days. Amax insists, however. that all pots at the 215,000 tonnes-a-year smelter will have been started by the end of September and that output will still be about 100,000 tonnes this year.</p>

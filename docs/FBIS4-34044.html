			<p>BFN     [Text] St. Lucia, like all the other countries in the  region, continues to fight off the drug menace. As is  customary, large quantities of drugs confiscated are set to the  torch, hoping that this and the fines and imprisonment terms can  act as a deterrent for both perpetrators and would-be felons.  Last month, members of the Royal St. Lucia Police Force,  accompanied by prison inmates, took a large quantity of  confiscated drugs to the dump site and set it alight. The  stash, comprising marijuana, cocaine, and crack, was estimated  at over ECU250,000.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Galina Yudkevich under the "Draft Law" rubric: </F> "What Guarantees Will People Infected With HIV Have" -- from the  "Retsept" section]    [Text] First, a few figures cited by Vadim Pokrovskiy,  head of the Russian Anti-AIDS Center, at a meeting of the [State  Duma] Health Care Committee, where the draft law "On Preventing  the Spread of HIV" was examined.    As of 1 April there were 740 Russian citizens (including 282  children) and 450 foreigners in Russia registered as being  infected with HIV. But when you consider that the period  between infection and the development of the outward signs of  the disease averages seven-eight years and the special survey in  1993 covered 25 million Russians, then registered cases  constitute only 15-20 percent of the true number of Russian  Federation citizens infected with HIV. Some 110 of those  infected have died. In terms of the number of people infected  or sick, the situation in Russia today corresponds to the  situation in the United States in the early eighties. There are  fears that in 10 years' time we could reach or even exceed the  current level of incidence of the disease in the United States  (1.5-2 million people infected).    As is known, a law "On AIDS Prevention" was adopted in the  Soviet Union back in 1990. Why do we need a new legislative act?    The main reason is that the situation is rapidly changing  for  the worse. For example, the problem of the increase in the  number of children infected as a result of medical negligence  (remember the recent Elista affair) has become topical only of  late, and only in our country.    There is a subjective reason too: The previous law (which is  still in force) contains substantial shortcomings. The very  term "the disease AIDS" is inaccurate: On the one hand, the  acquired immunodeficiency syndrome is the final stage of the  disease that begins with HIV infection; on the other hand, AIDS  can be caused by other factors as well -- exposure to radiation,  for example.    The 1990 law contains articles that are questionable from  the  viewpoint of the observance of human rights. Practice has shown  in recent years that the provision concerning the citizen's duty  to undergo a medical examination "if there are sufficient  grounds for supposing that the person is infected with HIV" has  led not only to compulsory examination ("sufficient grounds" has  sometimes been interpreted very freely by physicians), but to  considerable economic losses (total expenditure on "examination"  in 1993 constituted approximately 50 billion rubles).    One other obvious defect of the law was the lack of clarity  over the position of infected foreigners. According to the  statistics, HIV infection was found to be 100 times more common  in foreigners living in Russia than in Russian Federation  citizens, although the requisite legal mechanism for their  deportation does not exist.    The main purpose of the new draft law is to legislatively  confirm the state's duties in relation to the prevention of HIV  infection and the treatment of and provision of social  assistance for the victims. Antidiscrimination measures for  people infected with HIV and their families and social  guarantees for medical staff at risk of infection also need to  be enshrined in legislation. There must also be tougher  sanctions against medical staff responsible for infection.    According to the draft law, "a medical examination to  ascertain HIV infection is carried out if a person voluntarily  requests it or with his consent." This is the only wording that  corresponds to generally acknowledged international law  standards today. Only foreigners, blood donors, and some  categories of professionals -- surgeons, for example -- are  liable to compulsory examination. If infection is establishad,  the state has the right to deport foreigners, while Russian  citizens are "subject to monitoring at a special clinic and to  treatment only with their consent." They are entitled to all  types of free medical assistance in outpatient clinics and  hospitals, including free return travel to the place of  treatment.    A large section of the draft law is devoted to social  protection for people infected with HIV and for their families.  In particular, they are not allowed to be dismissed from work  or turned away from work or from medical, educational or  children's institutions. There are special articles stipulating  the rights of parents with infected children (being able to stay  with them in hospitals, retaining their continuous service  record with the payment of benefits in the event of their  leaving work to look after a child, top-priority provision of  separate housing); social protection for people in medical and  other professions at risk of infection.    Finally, a special article in the draft specifies the duties  of the state in relation to prevention of the disease, in  particular making medical examination, including anonymous  examination, accessible to all.    According to the members and experts of the State Duma  Committee on Health Care, the proposed draft law needs to be  fine-tuned: For example, social guarantees for people infected  with HIV through the fault of medical staff and sanctions  against the latter need to be specified.    In May the draft law "On Preventing the Spread of HIV in the  Russian Federation," finalized taking into account all the  observations, will be submitted for discussion by the State Duma.

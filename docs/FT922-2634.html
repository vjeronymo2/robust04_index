			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Echo Bay sees prospects for diamond finds ECHO BAY Mines, a medium-sized gold producer with four mines in Canada and the US, says some claims it controls near last November's kimberlite find in the Northwest Territories could also contain diamond 'pipes'. The staking rush at Lac de Gras, 200 miles north of Yellowknife, the NWT capital, now covers 13m acres and has reached Echo Bays' Lupin gold mine and its 17,000-acre mining lease. More test results are expected shortly from a 160-tonne bulk sample extracted from the Dia Met/BHP-Utah property. On May 21 the joint venture of Canada's Dia Met Minerals and Australia's BHP group reported indications of 90 carats of diamonds with 25 per cent potentially of gem quality. Echo Bay held exploration leases just east of the discovery, said Mr Richard Kraus, the company's president, after the annual meeting in Montreal. Also the winter road connecting Yellowknife and the Lupin mine crossed Lac de Gras near the discovery. He said diamond exploration was very expensive and if Echo Bay wanted to explore its claims further 'it would be done with partners'. 'We are helping other companies in the logistics of diamond exploration. I can't say more because we are in registration with a USDollars 100m convertible preferred issue.' Echo Bay's four mines, including Lupin, produced 734,000 troy ounces of gold and 5.6m ounces of silver last year. In the first quarter, it posted a small loss because of low bullion prices but the company said it expected a gradual recovery in the gold price to Dollars 360 to Dollars 375 an ounce by the end of the year. This, together with the new stock issue, would bolster cash flow and enable debt to be reduced from the present Dollars 257m. Mr Kraus said Russian sales had peaked and Asian prosperity was creating excellent fundamentals for gold. Far East fabricated demand, mostly for jewellery, was now three times North America's and world mine output was not growing. Echo Bay has cut manpower by 15 per cent to 1,934 without affecting output. The Lupin mill's capacity will rise 15 per cent to 2,300 tonnes a day next year. Other improvements are coming at the Nevada mines and another mine in Washington State. Two Alaskan properties are ready to move ahead when gold prices improve. Exploration is focussed on the Northwest Territories, British Columbia, Alaska, Washington State, Nevada and the western Rockies. In addition a senior executive is examining possibilities in the former Soviet Union.</p>

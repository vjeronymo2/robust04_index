			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / South African talks resume SOUTH AFRICAN groups from across the political spectrum yesterday formally resumed constitutional talks suspended since last May, but avoided addressing any of the substantive issues blocking agreement on a post-apartheid constitution. The talks, which had been planned as a two-day session, ended after only one day following agreement between the 26 parties to defer consideration of all important issues - including the name of the forum, participation in negotiations, as well as whether South Africa should be a federal or unitary state - to a smaller 'negotiation council' due to meet on April 15. Yesterday's meeting agreed certain procedural issues, such as how decisions would be taken in future meetings. It was agreed that 'sufficient consensus' would be required to take decisions. This means that participating parties can be overruled if their opposition does not halt all progress in the talks. But all of the tough work of negotiation remains to be done. Parties must agree on a bilateral proposal from the African National Congress and the government for multi-party power-sharing, and the vexed issue of the form of the state - federal or unitary - remains unresolved. The parties discussed the issue of violence, which had been expected to prove an obstacle to talks, without the kind of virulent verbal attacks which had been expected. However, the ruling National Party questioned the sincerity of one conference participant, the Pan Africanist Congress, whose armed wing has been accused of involvement in a number of recent murders of whites.</p>

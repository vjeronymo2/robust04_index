			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Koran-quoting businessmen campaign to work on Friday: Pakistan's government is being pressed to switch the day of rest from Friday back to Sunday 'Hasten earnestly to the remembrance of God, and leave off Business: That is best for you, if ye but knew. And when the Prayer is finished, then may ye disperse through the land, and seek of the bounty of God.' These are the verses of the Koran - the Islamic holy book - which are being quoted by a growing number of Pakistani businessmen who want their government to change the weekly holiday from Friday to Sunday. Mr Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the former prime minister toppled in a coup in 1977 and hanged two years later, changed the day of rest from Sunday to Friday shortly before his downfall, in addition to other steps towards Islamisation of the country, such as prohibition of alcohol. Those steps were introduced in response to pressure from Islamic clerics who were leading an anti-government campaign at the time. But now, some businessmen want the government led by the late premier's daughter, Ms Benazir Bhutto, to reverse the decision. If that happens, they stand to gain from another day of dealings with businesses across Asia and the western world. They argue that the Koranic verses only suggest the closure of business during the Friday afternoon prayers, to allow Moslems to attend prayer meetings, rather than observing it as a sabbath-style day of rest. 'When the time for Jumu'a (Friday) prayer comes, close your business and answer the summons loyally and earnestly, meet earnestly, pray, consult and learn by social contact: when the meeting is over, scatter and go about your business,' wrote Mr Abdullah Yusuf Ali, a famous Islamic scholar, in his widely-read translation of the Koranic verses. Such interpretations have only added to the determination of businesses seeking the change. 'Having the Friday holiday, we are cut off for 40 per cent of the week,' says Mr Haji Ghani, a leading stockbroker at the Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE), Pakistan's largest stock market. Mr Ghani is among brokers who support the change. They argue that the market is in contact with big western markets for only three days a week. For them, a normal working day on Thursday is a partial waste due to the time difference with Europe and North America, because the KSE closes before those markets open. 'The change will help to improve Pakistan's exports and improve our business prospects,' says Mr Mian Habibullah, a leading Pakistani industrialist who was recently appointed as the chairman of the government's Export Promotion Bureau. A growing number of business chambers and trade associations are either formally or informally joining the call. Some have written letters to the government seeking the change, while others are trying to lobby local MPs in an effort to seek support. Mr Ahmed Mukhtar, the commerce minister, concedes that there is a growing pressure from the business community, but adds that the government cannot reverse the decision, unless the issue gains national attention and there is widespread support. 'They (businessmen) are building a lobby. I am sure that whenever there is pressure from one community, and if they are able to convince the government that Friday should not be a holiday, with the passage of time the government may be forced to rethink,' he says. Mr Mukhtar says that ultimately the government may seek guidance from the National Council of Islamic Ideology. But he adds that it would only consider doing so if the pressure intensifies further. The government's caution is largely based on expected resistance from Islamic nationalists, many of whom are convinced that the Friday holiday should be retained in recognition of the day's traditional significance for rest and prayers. 'I don't see any religious objection, yet its a very important cultural issue,' says Mr Khurshid Ahmed, a leading scholar on Islamic economics and a senator from the religious Jamaat-i-Islami party. 'It's a question of historical tradition, and from that viewpoint, there is no reason for the Moslem world to just neglect its own traditions and blindly follow the western tradition,' says Mr Ahmed. He is also convinced that the change would carry few economic benefits. Despite the large time difference between Japan and the US, the two countries are still able to do business, which shows that such time difference is not really a serious restriction in development of business relations, he says. Mr Ahmed warns the government against a political backlash if it takes steps to accept the demand from businesses.</p>

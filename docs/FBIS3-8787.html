Since he did not  specify the direction of those decades that were passing so  quickly, judging by the war and the decline of the standard of  living, Croatia went 40 years back, rather than forward. The  debate about whether Croatia went back to 1941 or to 1945 has  been going on for four years. According to sporadic neo-ustashi  folklore study and the study of ornaments, some tend to claim  that Tudjman is closer to Pavelic [Croatian politician, founder  of the the Independent State of Croatia -- NDH -- in 1941] and  the NDH than to Tito and the Socialist Republic of Croatia. One  could find many similies to substantiate this topic -- formally.  However, in order to make a convincing material analysis, one  should better consider a meaningful comparison of the way of  production of the postwar Tito's society and (post)war Tudjman's  society. With regard to that, one could consider the category  of a law-ordered state. Legally speaking, the NDH was more of a  law-ordered state than the Croatia of the present day. How  come? It had monstrous, disgusting, racist laws, but its legal  proceedings were more or less governed in accordance with them.  Tudjman's Republic of Croatia does not have a legal basis for  harassing the Serbs, but rather "the best Constitution in the  world for ethnic communities and national minorities," but it  does not go by it in most cases.  <H5>  Constitution and Rights </H5>   Such an approach to legislature and regulations was the most  distinguishable trait of communists countries. Just as  communists made laws to comply with international political good  manners, so did Glavas [head of Osijek county], at one point,  with regard to defining the national and human rights of the  Serbs, say the Croatian Constitution was just a "piece of  paper." In distinction to the ustashas, to whom Hitler gave the  "revolution" of indulging themselves with the citizens of  Croatia, the members of the HDZ won the right to overthrow the  state themselves. If the communist revolution carried out in  the defensive antifascist war ended by harassing the former  enemy, the NDH, the HDZ revolution was also realized in the  defensive patriotic war by stigmatizing the participants of  former inimical Yugoslavia. The Communist Party of Yugoslavia  organized the uprising against the occupying German army [in  World War II], and the HDZ did so against the occupying JNA  [Yugoslav Peoples Army], and thus, after the victories, the  communists remained the only official antifascists and the HDZ  members the only official volunteers.    Just as Tito asked that chetniks who did not commit "too  many" crimes join the partisans, Tudjman asked them to join the  Croatian Army. Tito was teaching that agitation and propaganda  was the best means of forcing people to suffer their own damage;  Tudjman does that by increasing the propaganda for Croatian  national awareness. In diplomatic sequestration, Tito kept  Trieste and parts of Istria, Tudjman got "krajina." In the  postwar years, the USSR played a role of the magic guarantee for  a better future for communists, and now HDZ members think the  Unites States plays a comparable role. The cults of both Tito  and Tudjman were created by means of the monopolized media and  claques. But, just as legal development of Tito's cult deviated  from norms of realist socialism and contributed to the  imposition of sanctions by socialist countries (the Cominform  resolution), the development of Tudjman's cult resulted in  deviations from European norms, which almost lead to the  imposition of sanctions (UN resolutions).    Both regimes rely upon a powerful party -- the state in the  context of the geopolitically maximum possible political  pluralism. At that time, being expelled from the Communist Party  of Yugoslavia resulted in an immediate loss of official  function; today the same is happening to people expelled from  the HDZ. The division of people is executed according to similar  propagandistic patterns. People are either for Tito's Yugoslavia  or they are traitors who advocate Croatia, i.e., those who want  Tudjman's Croatia and traitors who are also inclined toward  Istria, Dalmatia, Slavonia.... Both authorities awarded  memorial medals and ideologized, politicized, and ascribed state  success to their party. What once meant the loss of political,  civic rights is today the loss of certificates of citizenship  and the pertaining rights. After the communist antifascist war  there was class differentiation, and during the HDZ antifascist  war ethnic differentiation pays the tribute. One is  particularly beware of "internal enemies" who are likely to  conspire with the "external enemy" -- a constant danger for the  young state.   <H5>    Watching for the Enemy </H5>   Therefore, protecting its existence justifies all means, so  Tudjman's enforcement of taxes is a counterpart to Tito's  enforcement of purchases, and Tudjman's (in)humane moving people  from their land is a counterpart to Tito's colonization of other  people's property. One-time forceful collectivization is, today,  replaced with forceful privatization, and the politics of doing  away with kulaks, with the politics of expropriating workers.  Farmers and the middle class paid for the development of the  "Yugoslav working class," workers and the middle class have paid  for the development of the "Croatian class." The former regime  forced the mobilization of the work force, and now the work  force is being mobilized. Farmers made the biggest contribution  to the communist revolution and, in the HDZ revolution, the  greatest victims are proletarians -- owners of their joblessness.    Centralization is a characteristic of both ways of ruling.  However, already in 1945, the communists passed the law on the  final liquidation of farmers' debts, which was the death of  farmers in the old Yugoslavia. In addition to centralization,  HDZ members incurred debts for the population: They took  foreign currency from the rich and asked the poor to buy their  own apartments (which they acquired on the basis of the public  ownership in which they partook financially), their own firms,  and to reduce health and retirement benefits. And just as in  the communist regime, farmers only had the right to minimal  ownership (their own land), it was not used optimally without  realistic market conditions; today, maximum private  entrepreneurship without market freedom is equally ridiculous,  since it is for the most part mediated by the state, instead of  the market Privatization Fund, and has connections with the HDZ  discretionary power.  <H5>  "Kulaks" and "Commies" </H5>   If it was once easy to change from sandals to shoes, today  one can change from shoes to a BMW even faster. But those who  lose awareness from the Croatianist patriotic conscience are not  getting BMW's, just as those who lost awareness from the  communist shock-worker awareness got very little. "Unaware  peasants" used to suffer a lot under the pressure of state  tutors if they contributed too little to the state; today,  "unaware intellectuals" suffer the same kind of pressure, for  they are not creating enough contributions for the statesman.  The Communist Party of Yugoslavia "became famous" for its  pressure on kulaks to "voluntarily" join peasants' work  communities, and the HDZ for its pressure on "social managers"  and speculators to join the HDZ, threatening that if they refuse  they would either be replaced or have to pay higher taxes.  Local communist authorities used to let off steam politically  abusing work mobilization, while the aphrodisiac of the HDZ  authorities is the abuse of military mobilization. Even greater  pleasure is derived from "unknown men" mistreating "NDH kulaks"  who refuse to obey work mobilization, i.e., "Yugo-commies" who  refuse to wear the uniform of the Croatian Army.    The leadership of the HDZ is aware of all those  irregularities, just as the Politburo of the Communist Party of  Yugoslavia was. Tito also knew what Tudjman knows today. And  what does Tudjman know about Tito today? He knows that Tito is  a much greater geopolitical and international reference for him  than Pavelic. Having finally paid off the Pavelic-like  ideological mortgage, in his conversation with Albanian  President Berisha, he made a wise reference to Tito, as a  Croatian politician and statesman. Has Tudjman finally  surpassed his revolutionary Titoist stage and approached a much  more civilized Tito from 1974? Anyway, in interethnic and  international relations, Tudjman should also follow Tito's  "non-Mandarin" strategic experience. If Tudjman has a strong  reason to draw his geopolitical thoughts from the positive and  acclaimed achievements of Titoism, he also has reason to  democratically dignify it by spreading his tolerance to his  critics. One could not publish a similar (ana)logical text in  the postwar Tito regime, but the mere act of writing alone could  incur an invitation for a "tourist tour" from Goli Otok [island  in the Adriatic Sea turned into a prison, mainly for political  prisoners] to Lepoglava [prison for political prisoners]. One  can say what one thinks about Tudjman -- even when one does not  think -- without fear. Without fear of being imprisoned.  Indeed, ambitious people only fear stagnation in their careers.  Is a new Tito the "Tudjman" who democratically came to his  senses and accepted the pluralistic public, or is Tudjman the  old "Tito" who ended his crypto-Croatian strategy on the basis  of the verified intraparty rough treatment of his followers?    All this needs to be critically examined in great detail.  The criticism of the Croatian state could, therefore, also  consist of its development, instead of the denial of both the  state and the criticism. The worst critical state is better  than the best state criticism, so the state and its critics  should agree that statesmen deal in politics and critics in  criticism, to the market satisfaction of their clients. What  kind of political market is it where politicians always "take  care" of critics?</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Work report of the Hebei Provincial Higher People's Court </F> delivered by Ping Yijie, president of the provincial higher  people's court, at the second session of the eighth provincial  people's congress on 1 March]    [Text] Fellow deputies:    I will now present a report to this session on the major  work  carried out by the people's court in 1993.    In 1993, people's courts at all levels in the province,  under  the leadership of party committees and the supervision of  people's congresses and with the support of pertinent government  departments, persistently took Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics as the guide,  conscientiously implemented the party's basic line consisting of  "one central task and two basic points," faithfully enforced the  Constitution and laws, carried out judicial work in an  all-around manner focusing on strengthening macroeconomic  regulation and control, opposing corruption, and safeguarding  social stability, and fulfilled the various judicial tasks  fairly successfully. In the past year, they concluded 191,013  cases in first and second trials and judicial supervision cases,  which showed an increase of 15.92 percent over the preceding  year. Of the total, 20,201 were criminal cases, 123,605 were  civil cases, 45,445 were cases on economic disputes, and 1,762  were administrative cases. The judicial work of the people's  courts played a positive role in safeguarding social stability,  protecting the legal rights and interests of citizens and legal  persons, and promoting reform, opening up, and economic  construction.    1. We sternly cracked down on serious criminal offenses to  safeguard social stability.    Last year, people's courts at all levels in the province  continued to implement the principle of meting out strict and  prompt punishment according to the law to strictly crack down on  criminal elements endangering public security. They handled  17,969 criminals cases of first trial in the year, and concluded  17,204 cases, or 95.74 percent of them. Judgments on 9,561  cases came into legal effect, and 14,691 persons were sentenced.    To penetratingly promote the struggle to "deal strict  blows,"  the provincial court, beginning early last year, made overall  arrangements for all the courts in the province to carry out  this struggle and then sent working groups to conduct  investigations and study on how work had been done. In August,  it held a work conference on strictly cracking down on serious  criminal offenses and production and marketing of fake and  inferior goods. Focusing on the priorities of the crackdown,  people's courts at all levels added impetus to resolutely and  sternly punish according to law, criminals with serious  offenses, such as murder, robbery, rape, hooliganism, arson,  bombing, and serious theft, especially habitual and repeat  offenders, offenders on the move, and chief criminals of  criminals rings. Meanwhile, in view of the public security  situation of their own localities, all courts closely  coordinated with public security and procuratorial organs to  actively wage struggles against theft and timely special  struggles against bus and train marauding and waylaying, damage  of power equipment, kidnapping, abduction, and trade of women  and children, and production and marketing of fake and inferior  products. Courts in the province concluded 6,718 cases which  seriously endangered public security and punished 7,894  criminals, showing an increase of 1.58 and 3.18 percentage  points, respectively, over the preceding year. Criminals guilty  of the most heinous crimes were resolutely sentenced to death.    In order to accelerate the rate of handling cases, timely  and effective blows were dealt to serious criminal offenses.  Courts at all levels continued to uphold the effective method of  intervening in the cases earlier than schedule, found out the  situation of major cases that were brought to court for  prosecution beforehand, discovered problems, offered suggestions  in a timely manner, and avoided repeating procedures in handling  cases. After the cases were brought to courts for prosecution,  they deployed the judicial force scientifically, assigned cases  to individuals as quickly as possible, read the cases  conscientiously, handled them locally, and rapidly ended the  cases on the premise of clarifying the basic facts and grasping  the basic evidence, and realistically guaranteeing the quality  of handling cases. Last year, of the cases accepted by courts  for public prosecution, excepting the small number of  complicated cases whose time for trial was extended, over 97  percent were completed within the legal time limit.    To expand the social effect of handling cases, courts in all  localities paid attention to selecting major and typical cases,  and went deeply to places where the cases occurred to conduct  public trials, to promote the legal system, to frighten the  criminals, and to educate the masses. Last year, courts across  the province held 531 open trials to try 2,161 cases involving  3,425 criminals, with nearly 8 million people listening to the  trials. Particularly, during the "4th May" and "1st October"  periods and before New Year, the provincial court organized  courts across the province to conduct activities on dealing  blows to criminals in a concentrated manner. Courts in all  localities made careful plans and arrangements, successively  held large-scale public trials, extensively conducted propaganda  through television, broadcast, and press media, dampened the  arrogance of criminals, and showed up the strength of the  people's democratic dictatorship.    Criminal offenses comprehensively reflect all kinds of  passive factors. To solve public security problems, we must  mobilize all social forces to participate in the comprehensive  management of public security. While punishing criminals and  doing a good job in trying civil, economic, and administrative  cases, the people's courts at all levels actively participated  in comprehensive management of public security through various  means. First, they conscientiously tried cases on delinquents.  Courts at all levels across the province established collegiate  benches for trying cases involving delinquents, and some courts  also established special tribunals to try this category of  cases, educated delinquents through trials, paid attention to  establishing relations with families and schools, implemented  all measures to help and educate delinquents, and succeeded in  educating, helping, and saving misguided youths. Second, they  maintained close ties with grass- roots mediation organs,  promptly grasped the symptoms of disputes, caught up with the  work on their own initiative, resolved the contradictions during  the budding stage, and prevented contradictions from turning  into crimes. Last year courts across the province resolved a  total of 1,993 contradictions of this category. Meanwhile, they  strengthened the professional guidance for mediators and helped  them enhance the ability to settle disputes. Third, in line  with the problems that emerged in the course of trials, they  offered judicial suggestions for relevant units in a timely  manner, urged them to stop the loopholes, improved system,  strengthened management, and took preventive measures. Last  year courts across the province offered a total of 4,869  judicial suggestions. Fourth, they monitored the acts of  criminals under probation or control so as to help and educate  them, purposefully transformed them through education, and urged  them to turn over a new leaf and to start a new life. Fifth,  they coordinated with the reform-through-labor departments to  transform and educate criminals serving their prison term, and  determined the reduction of prison terms or release on parole of  criminals who showed repentance or made contributions in line  with the reports of the reform-through-labor departments in an  effort to promote the transformation of criminals.    2. We strictly punished and handled the serious economic  criminals and promoted the thorough development of the struggle  against corruption.    Crimes in the economic field and particularly those  committed  by state functionaries embezzling public funds by taking  advantage of power and position and accepting bribes seriously  broke the socialist economic order and damaged the relationship  between the party and the people. In order to deal blows to  crimes, to punish and prevent the corrupt, and to implement the  demand set by the central authorities with regard to scoring  periodical achievements in this regard in the near future; the  people's courts at all levels throughout the province tried and  handled a large number of serious economic criminals by  earnestly implementing the guideline of strictly punishing and  handling criminals in line with the law and the principle of  "first being resolute, second cautious, and third accurate in  handling criminals." They accepted 1,921 cases in 1993, tried  and wound up 1,804 cases, and sentenced 1,947 economic convicts.  Of these criminals, 335 had more than 10,000 yuan of illegal  gains and 30 had more than 100,000 yuan of illegal gains.  Through trials these courts recovered 13.96 million yuan of  economic losses for the state and collectives. In dealing blows  to economic crimes, the people's courts at all levels grasped  the trial of serious and appalling cases; realistically enhanced  leadership over the trial; and made careful arrangements for the  trial. The first leading personnel of these courts took  personal charge of the trial, paid attention to grasping the  progress of the administration of justice, and frequently  conducted inspection and supervision. They also studied and  dealt with the problems and difficulties cropping up in the  administration of justice and encouraged or supported the  personnel in charge of trials to uphold the principles, to  eliminate the interference, and to do things strictly in line  with the law. Meanwhile, the report system for serious and  appalling cases was established and the responsibility system  for personnel in charge of trials was improved or implemented.  Based on clarifying the base number and in making backbone  personnel arrangements for trials, these courts fixed the  specific assignment of personnel for trials; fixed the number of  cases for judges; and fixed the date for winding up cases in  order to try and to wind up the cases as soon as possible. To  ensure the quality of the administration of justice and to deal  sure, accurate, and relentless blows at economic crimes, the  people's courts at all levels successfully made strict checks on  facts and evidences and accurately and adequately applied the  law. They paid special attention to setting up a demarcation  line between economic crimes and the general violation acts  cropping up in reform, opening up, and the establishment of  socialist market economic systems. They also carefully handled  the cases whose crimes are not clearly covered by the  regulations of the law and policies so as to truly enable their  trials to play a role of dealing blows to crimes, protecting  reform, and punishing or preventing the corrupt. In addition,  the people's courts at all levels paid attention to reinforcing  the dynamics in the propaganda work and selected the serious and  appalling cases that have a typical significance to broaden the  social effect by holding open trials. In October 1993, the  provincial higher people's court dispatched five work teams to  respectively go to various prefectures and cities to carry out  investigation and study and to supervise them to handle the  serious and appalling cases. The people's court of various  localities concentrated their time and efforts and took unified  action in holding open trials for economic crimes. Last  November, the provincial higher people's court and some  intermediate courts, respectively, held press briefings to  disclose their handling of serious and appalling economic cases,  during which they vigorously built up a momentum; revealed with  their practical deeds the determination made by the central  authorities and the provincial party committee in punishing and  preventing the corrupt; and played an active role in promoting  the through development of the struggle against corruption.  Difficulties encountered in investigating and handling the  economic cases were large and time spent on investigating and  handling these cases was long. The number of economic cases  that were prosecuted in the court showed a 21.91 percent  decrease compared to 1992. Along with the through struggle  against corruption, some economic crimes are successively being  exposed, investigated, and handled. Cases that will be  prosecuted in the court will increase. Punishing or handling  economic criminals and particularly trying the serious and  appalling economic cases will become an important and protracted  task.    3. We comprehensively strengthened the trial of the  economic cases and the fulfillment of the tasks to serve the  macroeconomic regulation and control and the development of the  economy.    Along with the far-reaching progress of reform, opening up,  and economic construction, various categories of economic  dispute cases rose by a big margin. Thus, the people's courts  at various levels increasingly undertake heavier tasks for  trying economic cases. Last year, the courts across the province  conducted first trials on 45,251 economic dispute cases, an  increase of 44.09 percent compared to the previous year; and  concluded 42,723 cases, an increase of 45.46 percent. Some  2.245 billion yuan were involved in the lawsuits, an increase of  20.69 percent. The people's courts at various levels  ceaselessly intensified the awareness of conscious and active  services; and accurately handled the relations between active  service and strict enforcement of laws, between basing  themselves on trials and expanding the scale of service, and  between legal standards and productive force standards. By  trying and handling a large number of economic disputes and  offering various forms of lawsuit services, the people's courts  ensured the smooth implementation of the measures for regulating  the economic relations, safeguarding the economic order, and  ensuring macroeconomic regulation and control. First, the  people's courts persistently placed on file, prudently handled,  and rapidly concluded the cases concerning the disputes over  loans that took place in the course of rectifying the financial  order, clearing up unreasonable loans, and violating regulations  to use inter-bank loans; the cases concerning the collective  economic disputes that cropped up by straightening out the  problems of wantonly collecting funds and wantonly issuing  enterprise bonds; and various categories of cases that were  closely related to the enhancement of the macroeconomic  regulation and control. In line with the situation that the  financial departments' failure to withdraw larger amounts of  loans affected the turnover of capital, the people's courts  actively worked in cooperation with the financial departments to  extensively disseminate laws and policies to enable the debtors  actively return their loan, brought their trial functions into  play, conscientiously examined and handled the disputes over  loan contracts, and helped withdraw the overdue loans according  to laws. Last year, the courts concluded 15,556 cases of this  category, and 765 million yuan were involved in the lawsuits.  Second, the people's courts timely and appropriately accepted  and handled the cases of the disputes over purchasing and  marketing, processing on a contracted basis, transfer of  techniques, and management on a leasing basis so as to help  enterprises promote the deepening of reform and the development  of production. Last year, the courts at various levels  concluded 13,792 cases of this category. The courts at various  levels positively helped enterprises clear up "debt chains" so  that enterprises could free themselves from the debt chains as  soon as possible and enhance their development vitality. The  people's courts first examined and handled the major cases  involving larger amounts of money and seriously affecting the  production and management of enterprises, particularly the cases  relating to the state-owned large- and medium-sized enterprises  so as to have the enterprises be extricated from the strained  circumstances and restore vitality. At the time when  enterprises cooperated with one another for management,  amalgamated with others, and declared bankruptcy, they timely  applied legal means to help sort out property and clear up debts  so as to promote the readjustment of the industrial structure  and the change of the enterprise managerial mechanism. Third,  they positively and steadily handled various categories of  disputes over rural contracts and served the rural areas' social  stability and economic development. By examining and handling  1,989 cases relating to the disputes over rural contracts,  particularly the disputes over contracts for fruit gardens and  mountain forests, that had the symptoms to intensify the  contradictions, that would easily cause the collectives to make  visits, and that would easily affect the stability of society,  the courts at various levels persistently relied on the support  of the local party committees, people's congress, and  governments to positively persuade the persons concerned and  timely and prudently examined and handled their cases according  to the laws. Fourth, people's courts at all levels adopted  various measures to provide legal service to economic  development. Last year, they established "economic dispute  mediating centers" to resolve economic disputes speedily with  simple methods. Many courts established ties with enterprises  and conducted investigation and study at enterprises on a  regular basis to help amend and improve economic contracts and  to help enterprises train law personnel through training classes  and by using certain cases to explain laws. In this way, they  carried out positive work to prevent and reduce economic  disputes.    Difficulty in executing the judgments remained a conspicuous  problem in the work of the people's courts and also a "notorious  problem" about which various circles of society had many  complaints. To safeguard the authority of the judgments and the  sanctity of laws, courts all levels established and improved the  executive organs, replenished the executive personnel, and  overcame numerous difficulties to greatly strengthen the  execution of judgments. Courts in the province handled 52,222  cases concerning the execution of judgments, and judgments on  46,866 cases, or 89.74 percent, were executed, which involved  490 million yuan. In executing the judgments, courts at all  levels firmly embraced the idea of service; paid attention to  properly handling the relations between executing the judgments  and supporting the survival and development of enterprises and  the relations between executing the judgments according to law  and stabilizing the overall situation; kept social effect in  mind when executing judgments according to law and with  civility; analyzed cases in a specific manner; and treated  different cases with different measures. Those capable of  repaying debts but refused to do so were forced to repay  according to law; those who refused to repay debts and whose  activities obstructed public affairs and constituted crimes had  their criminal liabilities pursued according to law; and  enterprises which were unable to repay debts for the time being  but had development prospects were helped to increase vigor and  enhance capacity instead of "having their geese that laid golden  eggs killed" so that they would make profits to repay debts. In  view of the practice of making no distinction between trials and  execution of judgments, wanton execution of judgments, and  wanton arrests of people, the provincial court held two  telephone conferences to emphasize the need to check law  breaches in the executive work and act strictly according to  law. Following the guidelines of the conferences, courts in all  localities earnestly made corrections, strengthened management,  and further established and improved various rules and systems  to reinforce the mechanisms for restraint and supervision. To  promote the judicial cooperation with the courts of other  provinces and municipalities, eliminate the interference of  local protectionism, and maintain the unity of the legal system,  the provincial court signed an agreement on judicial cooperation  with the seven neighboring provinces, municipalities, and  autonomous regions in 1991 and attended in September 1993 a  symposium on cooperation in courts' executive work attended by  Hunan and 15 other provinces, municipalities, and regions, thus  strengthening judicial cooperation on a larger scale and  alleviating, to a certain extent, the difficulty in executing  judgments in other localities. Last year, Hebei's courts were  entrusted by the courts of other provinces, municipalities, and  regions or to execute or to help them execute the judgments of  854 cases involving 58.71 million yuan. Courts of other  provinces, municipalities, and regions were entrusted by Hebei's  courts to execute or to help them execute the judgments on 406  cases involving 43.54 million yuan. Thanks to the unremitting  efforts, people's courts made substantial progress in the  execution of judgments. However, they still encountered great  difficulties. In particular, when executing the judgments on  economic disputes that involved different administrative areas,  cadres and policemen of courts were frequently attacked and  beaten, and sometimes even their lives were not guaranteed. To  realistically and effectively safeguard the sanctity of laws,  people's courts should continue efforts to improve work and  raise their judicial level, and all circles of society should  also provide more understanding, support, assistance, and  coordination.    4. We conscientiously tried civil and administrative cases  and realistically safeguarded the legal rights and interests of  citizens, legal entities, and other organizations.    In 1993, courts across the province accepted 121,642 civil  cases for first trial, an increase of 14.46 percent over the  previous year, and concluded 116,165 cases, an increase of 15.15  percent over the previous year. The number of civil cases was  big and was increasing every year. Last year civil cases  accepted by courts across the province for first trial accounted  for over 65 percent of the total number of cases accepted by the  courts, making the judicial tasks very heavy. This kind of cases  involved many families and were closely related with the  production and living of the people. Particularly, it is very  meaningful to handle these cases well in the situation of  establishing the socialist market economic structure. Courts  at all levels conscientiously implemented the "general rules of  civil codes," the "law on civil administrative procedures," and  all kinds of other civil laws and regulations. Through trying  57,719 cases on marriage and inheritance, they safeguarded  social stability and family harmony, promoted socialist morality  and practice, and promoted socialist spiritual civilization; and  by trying 42,822 cases on disputes concerning debts, mountain  forests, land, and water conservancy, they regulated the  relations of various rural economic sectors and promoted the  development of rural economy; and by trying 8,907 cases on  compensation for damages, intellectual property rights, and  labor disputes, meted out punishment for civil law-breaking acts  and safeguarded the legal rights and interests of the persons  concerned. In the course of handling cases, courts at all levels  strictly filed cases for investigation, opened court sessions,  confronted the accused with his accusers, conducted debates, and  handled other aspects of work in line with legal procedures.  They conscientiously implemented the principle of settling  civil cases on a voluntary and legal basis, mediated civil  disputes, and urged the persons concerned to conclude an  agreement on the basis of consultation on an equal term and  mutual understanding. Last year courts across the province  mediated and concluded 74,531 cases, accounting for 64.16  percent of the total number of concluded civil cases.  Meanwhile, they unceasingly summed up experiences in trials,  reformed the form of trying cases at courts, stressed the  responsibility of persons concerned to give evidence, guaranteed  the quality of handling cases, and enhanced the rate of handling  cases. Furthermore, the broad masses of civil judicial cadres  also exerted efforts to improve work style, often toured the  rural areas to handle cases, and in addition to concluding a  great number of civil cases, also handled 7,969 easy cases on  disputes, reduced the accumulated number of lawsuits from the  masses, and stabilized social order.    During trial of administrative cases, courts at all levels  conscientiously implemented the "law on administrative  procedures," and other administrative laws and regulations,  upheld the principle of allowing persons concerned to have equal  status in taking lawsuits, safeguarded the legal rights and  interests of citizens, legal entities, and other organizations,  and supervised and supported administrative organs to exercise  their powers in line with the law. In order to implement the  central directives on reducing the burdens of peasants, courts  at all levels actively accepted cases on adding burdens to  peasants, such as unwarranted pooling of funds and arbitrary  collection of donations of fees, involving administrative  organs, accelerated the trials, and paid attention to the social  effect while handling cases. Last year, courts across the  province accepted 1,463 administrative cases for first trial and  concluded 1,384 cases. Of the concluded administrative cases,  the adjudication of 399 cases made by administrative organs were  maintained, accounting for 28.83 percent, that of 279 cases were  canceled, accounting for 20.16 percent; and the lawsuits of 489  cases were canceled, accounting for 35.33 percent. While  properly handling all sorts of administrative disputes, courts  at all levels also actively helped administrative organs train  administrative law enforcing cadres, visited administrative  organs on their own initiative, jointly analyzed the reasons for  winning or losing the lawsuits in line with the cases, studied  and resolved all problems which they met in the course of  enforcing administrative law, offered judicial suggestions, and  enabled administrative organs to perform their work in line with  the law. Some courts also established special collegiate  benches to handle land and traffic cases in line with the local  reality, and in addition to handling administrative cases, also  went regularly to administrative organs to give all kinds of  legal services.    5. We made efforts to supervise lawsuits, appeals, and  trials; safeguarded, according to the law, the persons' relevant  legal rights; and upgraded judicial quality.    To ensure the quality of the cases to be handled, upgrade  the  judicial quality, and ensure fair judgments, the courts at  various levels vigorously strengthened the supervision of  lawsuits, appeals, and trials. Last year, the courts at  various levels accepted 84,624 visitors, handled 25,426 incoming  letters from the masses, and concluded 3,021 cases of various  categories under judicial supervision. The intermediate and  higher courts concluded 10,516 cases of various categories in  second trials. First, they firmly attended to the lawsuit work;  made efforts to eliminate the masses' difficulties in bringing  lawsuits; timely placed, according to laws, on file the lawsuits  lodged by the persons concerned and that conformed to the laws  and regulations; and delivered, according to the principle of  "separating the placement of files from trials," the lawsuits to  the relevant judicial organs for examination and handling. As  for the lawsuits without legal conditions for being placed on  file and those that were not managed by the courts, they also  conscientiously assumed responsibility to make explanations and  positively helped the persons concerned solve their  difficulties. Simultaneously, they regarded the acceptance of  visitors and the handling of incoming letters from the masses as  a window to establish contacts with the masses and to discover  problems and made efforts to improve their work according to the  masses' opinions and suggestions. Second, according to the  principle of seeking truth from facts and correcting mistakes,  they conscientiously examined and handled the relevant persons'  appeals and applications for retrial and the procuratorial  organs' protests, actively examined the judgments that became  effective, and corrected the wrong judgments according to the  judicial supervision procedures. Last year, the courts across  the province corrected the wrong judgments on 624 cases,  patiently had those who lodged unreasonable lawsuits withdraw  their lawsuits, and adopted forceful measures against those who  willfully made troubles and affected the social stability. The  courts at various levels focused their efforts on handling the  appeals lodged by the aged. The provincial court regularly sent  personnel to the Supreme People's Court to understand the  situation of the old visitors in the province and worked in  cooperation with the lower-level courts to study and work out  methods for solving their problems one after another. Last  year, the number of visitors delivering appeals to the courts  was reduced by 27.97 percent from the previous year. Third, as  for the appeals lodged by the persons concerned who had  complaints about the first trials and the protests made by the  procuratorial organs, the second-trial courts comprehensively  and conscientiously examined the facts, evidences, and legal  means that had been applied during the first trials; and handled  the appeals according to laws. Of the second-trial cases  concluded by the provincial court and various intermediate  courts last year, 5,022 cases maintained the original judgments,  1,786 judgments were corrected, and 1,390 cases were reexamined.    6. We achieved the self-construction, strengthened  scientific  management, and ensured the smooth progress of the trial work.    Over the past year, the people's courts at various levels  made efforts to achieve their self-construction in the spirit of  reform, ceaselessly strengthened scientific management, improved  the law enforcement environment, ensured the strict enforcement  of laws, and laid a foundation for smoothly accomplishing  various trial tasks.    A. The people's courts conscientiously strengthened the  ideological work and upgraded the political quality of the  cadres and policemen. The courts at various levels organized  cadres and policemen to conscientiously study the documents of  the 14th party congress and the third plenary session of the  14th party Central Committee, the guidelines of the second  plenary session of the central discipline inspection commission,  and the third volume of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping;"  persistently armed the heads of the cadres and policemen with  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building a socialism with  Chinese characteristics; ideologically and practically acted in  unison with the party Central Committee; and made the trial work  not be divorced from the political orientation. They regularly  conducted the education on the party's line and purpose, the  outlook on life, the outlook on value; resolutely resisted the  influence of money worship, hedonism, and out-and-out egoism;  conducted the education on the party's fine traditions and work  styles, including the arduous struggle and the mass line; kept  close contacts with the masses; firmly fostered the idea of  serving the people wholeheartedly; conducted the education on  the party discipline and regulations and the state laws;  ceaselessly enhanced the senses of party spirit, discipline, and  legal system; and resolutely safeguarded the unity and dignity  of the party discipline, the political decree, and the laws. By  conducting the education of multiple categories, we enabled the  broad masses of cadres and policemen to further upgrade their  understanding on the position and role of the people's courts in  the course of establishing the systems of socialist market  economy and to enhance their sense of historic mission and  political responsibility. Their quality in political affairs  was continuously being upgraded. Cadres and policemen in the  people's courts throughout the province have scored a large  number of moving deeds over the past year by overcoming  difficulties, being cautious and conscientious, and selflessly  making contributions. There were 510 units and 3,156 cadres and  policemen who were appraised as advanced collectives and workers  or were conferred with citations and prizes. The Dingzhou city  people's court and the Fengnan county people's court were  gloriously commended by the Supreme People's Court with the  Merit Citation Class I.    B. We did a good job in grasping the professional study and  conducting guidance over our subordinate courts and upgraded the  professional quality of cadres and policemen.    The people's courts at all levels actively encouraged and  supported cadres and policemen to study various laws and  policies and to particularly study the newly issued laws,  regulations, and rules, as well as the relevant policies of the  market economy so as to enable them to meet the demand of a new  situation and to better serve the economic construction. On the  one hand, they unswervingly and successfully conducted the  education on the legal courses in universities and in  specialized institutions; and adopted various styles, such as  holding professional training classes and conducting mobile  lectures for cadres and policemen, on the other hand. They also  upgraded step by step the specialized professional level of  cadres and policemen in the people's courts on a long-term basis  and in a planned manner. In the second half of 1993, the  provincial higher people's court assigned its judicial officers  in charge of economic cases, who had had experience gained from  judicial practice and known well the legal affairs, to hold 55  mobile lectures across the province on the practical problems  cropping up in the trials of economic cases. Almost 2,000  cadres attended the lectures. To further upgrade the judicial  level and to ensure the quality of handling cases, higher  people's courts vigorously enhanced their professional guidance  over their subordinate courts. They adopted the method of  "going down to low-level units and inviting the low- level  personnel" to jointly hold discussion and consultation on  handling serious, appalling, and knotty cases. They also further  perfected the systems of asking for instruction and making  reports, exchanged their work situation in a timely manner,  summarized their work experience, and formulated the  standardized opinions for trials in line with the judicial  reality. Based on the deep-going investigation and study, the  provincial higher people's court put forward the guiding  opinions in 1993 for handling the death penalty cases; for  setting up demarcation lines among different economic cases; and  for handling the traffic accidents cases as well as the disputes  over house lighting, over the compensation of medical faults,  and over real estate. It also promoted the upgrading of quality  and efficiency in handling cases by having standardized the  judicial activities.    C. We realistically enhanced the construction of leading  bodies and promoted the development of court work in various  fields. Over the past year, we have grasped the construction of  leading bodies of the people's courts at all levels by regarding  the construction as a strategic measure. We have also urged the  leading personnel of people's courts at all levels to set  example in studying the theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics and the theory of socialist market  economy and in opposing to corruption and protecting the  administrative honesty, to change their work style, to  industriously conduct the administrative work for the people,  and to be a good public servant. The leading personnel were  urged to uphold the principle of democratic centralism and the  staffers of leading bodies were urged to respect, support, and  understand one another as well as to foster a joint force.  Leading bodies were also urged to be responsible for their  subordinate units, to set an example for them, and to bring  along them in work. In 1993 the provincial higher people's  court held a two-month training class of specialized legal  knowledge for the presidents of grass-roots level courts, who  were newly elected during the term-shift election. The class  has laid a foundation for further and successfully conducting  the court work at grass-roots levels. After the combination  conducted between 12 prefectures and cities across the province  in the second half of 1993, the provincial higher people's  court actively helped and coordinated with local party  committees to complete the work for combination. It made  all-out efforts to grasp unity among new leading bodies and to  promote work link after the combination as well as stressed that  coordination among personnel even requires the thinking with one  heart and one mind. After the combination, the leading bodies  of intermediate people's courts successfully fulfilled the  various tasks of trials by making concerted efforts and  cooperating with one another.    D. We firmly and unswervingly maintained administrative  honesty, opposed corruption, and strictly enforced laws. The  provincial court positively consolidated and straightened itself  out in line with the opinions and suggestions raised by people's  congress deputies in the activities of appraising the work of  the provincial court that was organized by the provincial  people's congress standing committee in 1992. Courts at all  levels conscientiously implemented the "eight forbiddens" set by  the Supreme People's Court and the "10 regulations" formulated  by the provincial court, constantly perfected the system  concerning administrative honesty, strengthened the  self-restriction mechanism and the external supervision  mechanism, subjected the court work to the supervision by the  numerous masses, and strived to maintain administrative honesty  and strictly enforce laws. In line with the arrangements of the  provincial party committee and the Supreme People's Court, the  provincial court waged a struggle against corruption, banned  court departments from collecting 12 items of unreasonable  charges and from pooling funds to do business or run  enterprises, and strictly punished the cadres and policemen who  violated laws and disciplines. In the fourth quarter, the  provincial court conducted a general inspection on enforcement  of laws and disciplines and launched the activities of "lower  levels appraising higher levels." During the activities,  various courts at the grass-roots level appraised the work of  intermediate courts, and grass-roots courts and intermediate  courts appraised the work of the provincial court. At the same  time, leaders of higher-level courts led work teams to go deep  into various localities to inspect their work and solicit  opinions. The provincial court received a total of 36 opinions  and suggestions from lower-level courts, researched these  opinions and suggestions one by one, earnestly conducted  rectification and correction, and answered and resolved all  questions and cases.    E. We paid attention to self-construction, strengthened  scientific management, and improved law enforcing environment.  Courts at all levels, within the scope permitted by laws and  policies, carried out reform boldly, realistically, and  carefully. First, we positively pressed forward the reforms in  the fields of organizational setup, rules and systems, and work  methods of courts, thus making organizational setup perfect, the  relations between different sectors reasonable, tasks definite,  and work efficiency better. The provincial court was making  efforts to organize and build the second judicial tribunal,  conducted the service other than legal proceedings through  diverse channels in the course of fulfilling the judicial tasks,  vigorously strengthened the guidance to lower levels, and  further promoted the trying of economic cases among all courts.  Second, we reformed and perfected the form of opening court  sessions to try cases, standardized the procedures of opening  court sessions to try cases, better exploited the functional  role of collegiate bench, and stressed the evidence providing  responsibility of the parties involved in civil and economic  cases. At the same time, we conducted positive explorations and  experiments for separating registration from trying of cases and  for separating adjudication from execution. Third, we perfected  work systems of the economic disputes mediation center, such as  the system with regard to registration and mediation of cases  and the system with regard to collection of fees, defined the  nature and duties of the center, strictly executed the relevant  regulations on civil procedures law. Fourth, we straightened  out the tribunals and law execution agencies stationed at  administrative organs, clarified boundaries between the judicial  power and the administrative power, prevented judicial personnel  from participating in administrative behaviors beyond their  powers, and also prevented administrative personnel from holding  judicial posts in order to ensure the independent execution of  judicial powers by people's courts. In the course of building  themselves well, courts at all levels strengthened scientific  management by tapping their own potentials, and strived to seek  better efficiency and higher level from scientific management.  In the field of material construction, courts at all levels  carried forward the fine tradition of arduous struggle, tried  every possible means to overcome difficulties, and made new  progress in building judicial courts and people's courts and in  building traffic, communications, and equipment installations.  In addition, courts at all levels strengthened the judgment by  legal medical experts, investigation and study, and file  management, thus creating conditions for improving the level of  adjudication.    Hebei's courts scored fairly good achievements in 1993,  which, however, should be attributed to the leadership of party  committees, the supervision of people's congresses, the support  of pertinent government departments, and the concerted efforts  of their cadres and policemen. There were also problems and  deficiencies in our work. The major ones were the failure in  fully suiting our thinking and concepts to the new situation in  the socialist market economy system and the failure in fully  performing our functions to serve reform, opening up, and  economic construction; some localities' failure in strictly  enforcing laws, making fair judgments, and handling cases in a  timely manner; and the problems in law-enforcement conditions  that need to be further improved and the funds for handling  cases that need to be guaranteed with intensified measures so  that a good environment can be created for law enforcement.    Fellow deputies, 1994 is a crucial year for promoting the  package reform of the economic structure and making  breakthroughs in key areas. Seizing the opportunity, deepening  reform, opening wider to the outside world, promoting  development, and maintaining stability constitute the overall  interests of the work of the entire party. The new situation has  set new and still higher demands on the work of people's courts,  which, in summary, are to create momentum in "dealing strict  blows," to achieve good results in handling major and serious  cases, to make substantial progress in regulating economic  relations, and to comprehensively raise the judicial level. In  compliance with the requirements of the party Central Committee,  the provincial party committee, and the Supreme People's Court,  the basic tasks for the people's courts in 1994 are, guided by  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics and the guidelines of the third plenary  session of the 14th party Central Committee, to continue dealing  strict blows to serious criminal offenses, to do a better job in  trying major and serious cases, especially major and serious  economic cases, to greatly regulating economic relations, to  conscientiously safeguard the legal rights and interests of  citizens, legal persons, and other organizations, to strictly  enforce laws, to raise judicial level, and to serve the  endeavors of safeguarding social stability, promoting  administrative honesty, and establishing the socialist market  economy system more rapidly. To fulfill these tasks, we should  achieve success particularly in the following work:    First, we should strictly crack down on the criminal  offenses  that endanger state safety and social security to safeguard  state and social stability. Courts at all levels should  profoundly understand the strategic idea of "attending to two  tasks simultaneously and being competent in both," further  strengthen the function of dictatorship over enemies, and  resolutely punish the criminals who seriously endanger state  security. We should adhere to the principle of meting out stern  and prompt punishments to continue the struggle of "dealing  strict blows," clarify the focuses of attack, and wage special  struggles at opportune times and concentrate efforts on the  crackdown of certain crimes to create momentum and achieve  notable social effect. Meanwhile, we should actively  participate in the comprehensive management of public security.    Second, we should continue cracking down on serious economic  offenses to promote honesty in administration. Focusing on  punishing corruption and bribery, we should sternly punish  criminals with serious economic offenses to promote the in-depth  development of the anticorruption struggle. We should muster  efforts and organize meticulously to achieve a breakthrough in  trying major and serious cases.    Third, we should regulate the relations in various economic  sectors in line with law and promote the establishment of the  socialist market economic structure. We should fully apply the  judicial means, serve the cultivation and development of the  market economic structure, promote the establishment of the  modern enterprise system, protect the decisionmaking rights of  enterprises in line with the law, safeguard the responsibility  system with the family-based output-related contract  responsibility system as the mainstay, and promote comprehensive  economic invigoration in the rural areas. We should pay great  attention to investigating and handling new cases involving  foreign countries, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan emerging in the  course of deepening reform of the economic structure and strive  to make new breakthroughs in economic trails.    Fourth, we should give full play to the functions of courts  in civil and administrative trails and realistically safeguard  the legal rights and interests of citizens, legal entities, and  other organizations. It is necessary to properly handle the  internal contradictions among the people, promote stability,  unity, and the building of socialist spiritual civilization.    Fifth, we should strictly enforce the law and raise the  level  of judicial work. We should uphold the principle of  independently exercising judicial rights, based on facts, and  taking law as the criterion under the leadership of the party  committee, strengthen judicial supervision, strictly enforce  judicial discipline, and conscientiously implement the  responsibility system in handling cases and reinvestigating  wrong cases. It is necessary to actively accept supervision  from the people's congresses at all levels, unceasingly improve  law enforcing activities, and raise the level of judicial work.    Sixth, we should unceasingly sum up experience and deepen  reform in courts. With the spirit of emancipating the mind,  seeking truth from facts, making experiments actively, and  advancing steadily, we should follow the legal principles,  principles that are conducive to unifying the legal system, the  principle of making things convenient for the masses to make  lawsuits and to bring the cases to courts for trial, and the  principle of safeguarding the legal rights and interests of the  people concerned, and continue to grasp reform in line with the  characteristics of courts. We should actively strengthen  grassroots courts, particularly the work and building of  people's courts, give full play to their role of being close to  the masses and making things convenient for them to make  lawsuits, discover and settle disputes in a timely manner,  safeguarded social stability, and accelerate the pace of serving  economic development.    Seventh, we should strengthen the contingents and raise the  political and professional level of cadres and policemen.  Further efforts should be made to strengthen the study of  political theories, deepen the anticorruption struggle, and  resolutely check unhealthy trends among courts. We should do a  good job in improving the ideology and work style of court  leading bodies at all levels, and enable them to become a strong  core of leadership with high political awareness, good work, and  good work style. With a strategic insight, we should continue  to grasp the education and training of cadres, enhance the  integrated professional quality of court cadres and policemen  across the province and pay attention to cultivating a number of  judicial officers specializing in the work of this field so as  to meet the needs of the development of situation.    Deputies, in the new situation of establishing the socialist  market economic structure, people's courts have to undertake  more arduous tasks and heavier responsibilities. We must  further emancipate the mind under the leadership of the party  committees and the supervision of the people's congresses, renew  concepts, unite as one, work hard, give better play to the  functional role of judicial organs, and make greater  contributions to maintaining social stability in our province,  guaranteeing reform, expanding opening up, promoting  development, and building an economically strong province.</p>

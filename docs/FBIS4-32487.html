			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] [Announcer] [passage omitted] Our colleague  Judit Laszlo now reports on the signing of the coalition  agreement.    [Laszlo] [passage omitted] All the personnel proposals will  only become definitive when, together with the other chapters of  the coalition agreement, they are adopted on 26 June by the  Hungarian Socialist Party congress and the Alliance of Free  Democrats delegate assembly.    Prime Minister-nominee Gyula Horn also outlined the tasks of  the immediate future. It is proposed that the parliamentary  debate of the government program and the election of the head of  government should take place 14-15 July. Parliamentary deputies  should receive the program on 8 July. Another proposal is that  the minister nominees should be heard by the relevant committees  of the National Assembly 11-12 July.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Awdah 'Awdah] </F>   [Text] PLO Executive Committee member Sulayman al-Najjab  refused to participate in the Executive Committee meeting which  began in the Tunisian capital last evening. The meeting was  called for by Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat.    In an exclusive statement to AL-RA'Y, al-Najjab said he did  not attend the meeting to protest the manner in which the  Executive Committee was treated. He said the decisions of the  committee and the instructions it gave to the Palestinian  negotiating delegation were not respected. The Cairo agreement  between 'Arafat and Peres was a deviation from all these  decisions and instructions. Al- Najjab urged the Executive  Committee members to reject the Cairo agreement because it  entrenches the Israeli understanding of the Declaration of  Principles.    Al-Najjab, who is the representative of the Palestinian  People's Party [PPP] in the Executive Committee, warned against  continuing the current policy of dealing with the negotiating  process, which is proceeding without any terms of reference and  any clear negotiating plan that is committed to the Palestinian  understanding of the Oslo agreement, whose objective is to  secure Israel's withdrawal from all Palestinian territories  occupied in 1967 and to guarantee the Palestinian people's right  to self-determination.    Al-Najjab warned against the danger of unilateral and  unstudied decisions, and against responding to pressures  employed by foreign parties that do not take into account the  legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.    Al-Najjab called anew for respecting the Executive  Committee's decisions and for organizing its action as the  higher Palestinian authority, including its decision to form a  body responsible for negotiations that no party can overstep.  He also called for adopting a Palestinian negotiating plan that  reflects the Palestinian militant concept of the Oslo agreement,  and for assigning qualified Palestinian politicians the task of  implementing this plan.    Following the signing of the Cairo agreement, the PPP's  Political Bureau issued a statement, a copy of which was  received by AL-RA'Y. The statement urged the Executive Committee  to reject this agreement and to lay down new bases for the  negotiations aimed to realize the legitimate rights of the  Palestinian people.    The statement described the agreement as disappointing to  the  popular aspirations, and said the warnings expressed by the PPP  when it conditionally accepted the Oslo agreement were  legitimate. Since the beginning, the PPP has called for giving  the Oslo agreement a militant concept and not to view it as a  petition presented to the Israeli authorities. The PPP also  called for working out a clear negotiating plan, for high  Palestinian performance, and for a fixed political authority.  These demands ensure that the Oslo agreement will be the  beginning of the march toward independence, and prevent the  Israeli concept of implementation of the agreement, which would  entrench the occupation.    The Cairo agreement is closer to the Israeli understanding  of  the Oslo agreement. It adopted the Israeli concept of security,  which is an expansionist one that seeks to entrench settlements.  This concept conflicts with the natural concept of security as  stipulated in Resolution 242, which is based on the 1967 borders.</p>

			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / International Company News: DSM plunges 30% in quarter DSM, the Dutch chemicals group, said net profit in the second quarter fell by nearly 30 per cent from a year earlier, dragging down first-half net earnings by 37 per cent to Fl 210m (Dollars 127m). The company said margins had come under pressure from lower selling prices and continued worldwide overcapacity, as well as from a decline in demand for chemicals in eastern Europe which was causing fiercer competition than normal in western Europe and the Far East. However, the second-quarter net profit of Fl 110m was slightly better than the result achieved in the first quarter, when profit had tumbled by 43.8 per cent to Fl 100m. In its first forecast for full-year results, DSM said 1992 profit would be lower, but it gave no figures. The interim dividend was unchanged at Fl 2.65. Unlike the first quarter, when lower profits were due chiefly to narrower margins in hydrocarbons and polymers, the second-quarter downturn mainly reflected a worsening of results in base chemicals, which were hit hardest by the faltering eastern European demand. In the first six months, the operating profit of the hydrocarbon and polymers division fell to just Fl 1m from Fl 9m a year earlier. The base and fine chemicals division saw operating results fall to Fl 81m from Fl 149m. Turnover was down 3 per cent at Fl 4.9bn.</p>

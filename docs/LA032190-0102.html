			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O.C.'S HOMELESS ARE IN DEMAND ON CENSUS NIGHT  </P> <P> The minibus arrived promptly at 6 p.m. in front of St. John's Lutheran Church  and the passengers, familiar with the shelter routine, quickly formed a line at  the door.  </P> <P> The church's aging gymnasium seemed vast, dotted with a dozen or so cots, the  floor covered with a blue tarpaulin. But within minutes, the home of the church  basketball team, choir club practice and the potluck dinner became a temporary  refuge for the homeless.  </P> <P> The immediate concern for the 25 or so men and women was cots: Were they  assigned, were there more? And blankets? And where were the showers, and when  would dinner be served?  </P> <P> Among this disparate collection of Orange County's street people, there was  very little talk about the first-ever count of the nation's homeless. But St.  John's opened its doors Tuesday to help census takers reach as many homeless as  possible.  </P> <P> City and county officials have urged shelter operators and their clients to  cooperate with the census, as the area's claim to federal aid for homeless  programs will depend in large measure on the number of people surveyed. Across  the country, civic leaders raced Tuesday to round up homeless people, many of  whom crave their anonymity, and shuttle them to areas where census workers  could reach them.  </P> <P> "There is no way that everyone will be counted," said Susan Oakson of the  Orange County Homeless Issues Task Force. "But we know that policy decisions  and funding will be based on this information, and for our community it is  important to make as accurate a count as possible. What has to be understood is  that this information will be just a slice."  </P> <P> Across Orange County, homeless people by the hundreds came in from the  darkness. Some of them complied nervously, others with unfounded fears that  being uncooperative would get them arrested.  </P> <P> St. John's was one of two churches that opened their doors to the homeless in  conjunction with Tuesday night's count.  </P> <P> Orangethorpe United Methodist Church in Fullerton was the other, and it was  there that Richard Martinez, who showed up in search of a place to sleep,  agreed to be counted. But he remained skeptical of the promise that his lot  will improve because of his cooperation.  </P> <P> "It's a political thing," he said. "They say that there will be more money for  social programs just to get us to fill it out."  </P> <P> Thomas Driber, program coordinator of the Anchor House in San Clemente, said  many of the homeless people with whom he spoke were wary of the census. "Some  are willing to be very cooperative," he said. "Others have the feeling: 'Why  bother? The system hasn't done anything for me, and it's getting worse.' "  </P> <P> Still, all the residents of Anchor House cooperated, egged on by census  officials who informed them that "they had no choice," Driber said. Although it  is illegal to refuse to cooperate with census takers, such cases are rarely  prosecuted.  </P> <P> Despite the reservations, many homeless people gathered in the lobbies,  gymnasiums and corridors of shelters filling out forms that would document  their homelessness.  </P> <P> "It is a good idea to acknowledge these people and myself, to find out what the  reality is," said Eugene Binau, 35, who has mostly slept on the concrete steps  of Santa Ana Civic Center during the four months he has been homeless.  </P> <P> Binau, a Santa Ana native and an unemployed auto painter, said this is the  first time that he has experienced living on the street. "It only takes one or  two things to go wrong. Like if you can't find a job quick enough, then you can  lose it all," he said, standing on the steps of the church.  </P> <P> Gezabel Burke, 28, sat with a towel wrapped around her just-washed hair at the  Martha House in Orange. Burke, a student at Golden West College, became  homeless after her boyfriend threatened to kill her and she sought refuge in a  shelter for battered women.  </P> <P> "They should have asked other questions, like 'are there drug problems in the  home?' and 'is there alcoholism in these places?' ".  </P> <P> Contributing to this story were Len Hall, Laura Michaels, Michelle Nicolosi and  Leon Teeboom.  </P></p>

			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Government Bonds: Weaker-than-expected retail sales spur UK issues UK GOVERNMENT bonds firmed in fairly active trading yesterday as weaker-than-expected retail sales in December revived hopes of a further cut in base rate. Retail sales fell 0.7 per cent last month, compared with market expectations of a rise of between 0.3 to 0.4 per cent. The interest rate speculation prompted a steepening of the yield curve, and at the short end, the 10 per cent gilt due 1994 rose  3/32 to 104 3/4 to yield 6.35 per cent. However, longer-dated issues were held back by the forthcoming auction, due on January 27, and the 9 per cent 2008 gilt closed at 101 13/32 down  1/16 on the day, to yield 8.82 per cent. GERMAN government bond prices fell in late trading ahead of the Bundesbank's regular fortnightly council meeting today as hopes of a cut in headline interest rates waned. The Bundesbank yesterday accepted bids for DM60bn in a tender for 14-day securities repurchase funds, allocating funds mostly at 8.60 per cent. The March bund contract traded on Liffe closed a  1/4 point lower at 92.95 in modest volume of little over 35,000 contracts, after an early high of 93.14 and a low of 92.92 in the afternoon. Caution ahead of the Bundesbank's meeting spread to other European government bond markets. Dutch bonds tracked their German counterparts, falling in the late afternoon. However, dealers said that a correction had been expected after the sharp gains in the Dutch market recently. The new 10-year bond slipped 35 basis points to 99.35, to yield 7.09 per cent. Elsewhere in Europe, Italian government bonds also ran into profit taking, and the Liffe March futures contract eased 9 basis points to 94.77. JAPANESE government bonds closed slightly lower, weighed down by talk that the government might be forced to issue Y5,000bn-worth of deficit-financing bonds in the next fiscal year. Earlier in the day, cash bonds and futures had risen to their highest levels in nearly five years on growing expectations of a rate cut in Japan. Mr Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party's policy affairs research council, reportedly called for a decisive cut in the official discount rate. The March futures contract rose to 109.63, its highest level since February 5, 1988, but it fell sharply to end at 109.21 in Tokyo after 109.37 on Tuesday. In London, the contract recovered to 109.29/30. Some dealers said they expected some short-term weakness in the March contract but that a target of 110.95 was still possible. The yield on the benchmark No 145 10-year bond ended at 4.365 per cent in Tokyo, two basis points higher on the day, and was broadly unchanged in London trading. US TREASURY prices posted early gains on speculative buying, lower oil prices and a reaction to conciliatory noises from the Iraqi government. However, the early momentum was not sustained and prices eased at the long end of the yield curve although shorter-dated maturities held their ground. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  5/32 at 103 21/32 , yielding 7.315 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was up  1/16 at 100 15/32 , to yield 4.352 per cent. There was no fresh economic news released yesterday, so trading was relatively subdued, and attention was fixed on the presidential inauguration ceremony in Washington. Prices came off their highs following the president's inaugural address, which contained nothing specific on fiscal policy, and disappointed investors who had been looking to Mr Clinton to give more details of his plans for the economy. THE London Clearing House said yesterday that it was extending the range of German securities which can be used as collateral by its clearing members to cover margin liabilities. From today, the London Clearing House said it would accept Bundesschatzanweisungen-Obligationen der Deutschen Bundespost and Obligationen der Deutschen Bundesbahn.</p>

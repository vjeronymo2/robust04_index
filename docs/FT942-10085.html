			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Observer: The hand of Hillary So who was the senior US official who shook Fidel Castro's hand in Pretoria at Nelson Mandela's swearing-in and extracted from the Cuban president a compliment for being 'a brave man' for so doing? The Washington Post, which reported the incident, would not say. But the Los Angeles Times pointed the finger at Mike Espy, the agriculture secretary. It also said that Espy was far from alone and that several White House aides had their pictures taken with Castro in a reception maelstrom. 'Can't you even play tourist?' asked one. 'I mean, I turned around and there he was.' Disciplinary action for consorting with the enemy is unlikely. Bill Clinton is not about to sacrifice a black cabinet member for a handshake and he hardly needs to have more vacancies on the White House staff. Mind you, if Hillary had extended her hand, the Wall Street Journal would already have written an editorial and Castrogate would be in full swing.</p>

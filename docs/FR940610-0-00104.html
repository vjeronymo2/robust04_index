Paragraph (b) of this section explains how a prior-month election is made. The interest rate for the month so elected is the applicable section 7520 interest rate. If the actuarial factor for either or both of the 2 months preceding the month during which the interest is transferred is based on a mortality experience that is different from the mortality experience at the date of the transfer and if the taxpayer elects to use the section 7520 rate for a prior month with the different mortality experience, the taxpayer must use the actuarial factor derived from the mortality experience in effect during the month of the section 7520 rate elected. All actuarial computations relating to the transfer must be made by applying the interest rate component and the mortality component of the month elected by the taxpayer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Transfers of more than one interest in the same property.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If a taxpayer transfers more than one interest in the same property at the same time, for purposes of valuing the transferred interests, the taxpayer must use the same interest rate and mortality component for each interest in the property transferred. If more than one interest in the same property is transferred in two or more separate transfers at different times, the value of each interest is determined by the use of the interest rate component and mortality component in effect during the month of the transfer of that interest or, if applicable under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, either of the two months preceding the month of the transfer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Information required with tax return.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following information must be attached to the income tax return (or to the amended return) if the taxpayer claims a charitable deduction for the present value of a temporary or remainder interest in property_  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) A complete description of the interest that is transferred, including a copy of the instrument of transfer;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The valuation date of the transfer;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The names and identification numbers of the beneficiaries of the transferred interest;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) The names and birthdates of any measuring lives, a description of any relevant terminal illness condition of any measuring life, and (if applicable) an explanation of how any terminal illness condition was taken into account in valuing the interest; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) A computation of the deduction showing the applicable section 7520 interest rate that is used to value the transferred interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Place for filing returns.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> See section 6091 of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder for the place for filing the return or other document required by this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Election of interest rate component <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _(1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Time for making election.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A taxpayer makes a prior-month election under paragraph (a)(2) of this section by attaching the information described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section to the taxpayer's income tax return or to an amended return for that year that is filed within 24 months after the later of the date the original return for the year was filed or the due date for filing the return. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Manner of making election.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A statement that the prior-month election under section 7520(a) of the Internal Revenue Code is being made and that identifies the elected month must be attached to the income tax return (or to the amended return).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Revocability.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The prior-month election may be revoked by filing an amended return within 24 months after the later of the date the original return of tax for the year was filed or the due date for filing the return.

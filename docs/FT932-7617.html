			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / UK Company News: 300 jobs go in East Midlands Electricity cost cutting move EAST MIDLANDS Electricity is to cut 300 jobs and reduce the size of its headquarters in a restructuring of the core business which will also see a rationalisation of the board of directors. Yesterday's announcement is the latest in a series of cost-cutting moves by electricity companies. Like several others in the sector, East Midlands is consolidating the number of districts and sharpening its focus on profits. Thirteen districts, which have in the past been cost centres, will be turned into seven profit centres. The management of profits from buying and selling electricity will be devolved to the regions. At the top of the company the 11-person board is being cut by two. Mr Keith Jackson is taking early retirement and Mr Philip Champ, while retaining responsibility for generation and overseas operations, is relinquishing his board position. The restructuring of the distribution business will cut annual operating costs by about Pounds 10m. The job losses, which will take place over 18 months, are expected to cost Pounds 13m, but Mr John Harris, chairman, said this was already built into cost forecasts. The 300 job losses follow a reduction of 100 in the last year and 400 since privatisation. Mr Harris said the move was part of a gradual process, rather than a step change. Middle management jobs would be cut, said Mr Harris. Others would move out of head office to the business units. The seven business units are Coventry, Derby, Leicester, Lincoln, Milton Keynes, Northamptonshire and Nottingham. The new structure incorporates a six month pilot project at Derby which the company says resulted in wider spans of control and shorter lines of communication.</p>

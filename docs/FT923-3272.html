			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Drink: A vodka or two in Tbilisi - Nicholas Woodsworth falls victim to Georgian hospitality - and wonders how they manage to live so long when they drink so much vodka and eat so much spicy food TIMES are as hard for cooks as they are for everyone else these days in the former Soviet empire, and it is not always easy to get something to eat. So when I found a small restaurant on Pushkin Avenue, in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi, actually open and serving food, I went in and sat down gratefully. It was not much of a place; just a few tables covered with plastic tablecloths and laid with bent and tinny cutlery. A fluorescent tube flickered on the low ceiling and a cold draught blew in under the door. In a kitchen behind a self-service counter, greasy pots sat on a sauce-spattered cooker. It was not the world's most cheerful establishment. It was much more cheerful, though, than the world that lay immediately around it. Just outside the door, soldiers of the Georgian National Guard patrolled the streets, Kalashnikovs cradled on their chests. Store-front windows were smashed, buildings were pock-marked with bullets, and many shops and offices were closed. Since declaring independence from the Soviet Union, Georgians had been swept up in a spiral of economic chaos and political violence. Arriving in a lull between bloody demonstrations, and street battles, I found little sense of pleasure or relaxation in Tbilisi. Great was my surprise, then, when I noticed a party of five elderly Georgian men celebrating in a small alcove at the back of the restaurant. None appeared to be under 80. Dressed in baggy suits and flat caps, their stubbly, unshaven faces flushed with drink and emotion, they were carrying on as if in advanced warm-up for a bacchanalian orgy. In front of them lay a table scattered liberally with the remains of grand over-indulgence: kebab skewers, chicken bones, empty cigarette packets, scraps of food, the gnawed stems of pickled peppers, bowls of spicy sauces and condiments, a dozen empty pots and serving dishes, and countless wine and brandy bottles. The feast had been a large and protracted one. The main meal over, the party had turned its attentions to drink, and was well along its way to inebriation. There were long, loquacious and emotional speeches, whiskery kisses and bear-hugs of comradeship, and many, many up-endings of tumblers brimful of brandy. By the time I had finished eating and was getting ready to leave, the old gents were preparing their voices for a round of five-part Georgian counterpoint. As far as they were concerned, it seemed, the world had never been a more convivial place. The incident so impressed me that it was the first query I put to Nino, my Georgian guide, as we rattled out of Tbilisi on our way to a tour of the high Caucasus mountains. Nino laughed. Such a thing, she said, was not so strange as it might seem. 'We Georgians have a reputation for good living. For us, friendship, generosity and hospitality are the most important things in life. We love to get together, to talk, to sing, to eat and to drink; probably a little too much, sometimes.' That was all very well, I replied, but even the most enthusiastic of bon vivants tend to find tear gas and riot truncheons something of a damper to any celebration. But, once again, Nino found little out of the ordinary in this. 'What you saw last night,' she said, 'was not so much celebration as commiseration. Georgia has been a land of violence and suffering through much of its 3,000-year history. In the past 1,500 years alone, Tbilisi has been invaded and sacked 29 times.' 'When we get together to eat, it is often to share not just food but our suffering. When we toast each other over brandy, it is not in congratulation but to ask for peace, security, fraternity and all the other things we need so much and rarely have. Tbilisi is a sad place right now. I hope we will have a chance to see Georgians when they are really happy.' And so, a little while later, we did. What Nino did not mention, but what I was soon to find out in the mountain village of Ushguli, was that the Georgian code of hospitality extends not only to friends and family but to complete strangers as well. The inhabitants of the isolated villages of the Caucasus may no longer believe, as once they did, that guests come from God, but they continue nonetheless to reserve a heavenly welcome for them. Nowhere is Georgian hospitality demonstrated more effusively than at the dinner table. Protected behind a high wall of mountains, Georgians are something of an anomaly among the many peoples of the former Soviet Union. Gregarious, emotional, sensual, jealous of their traditions and and ferociously proud of their fertile land, they have far more in common with the Mediterraneans than their cousins to the frozen north. As in character, so in food. Ask any Russian in Moscow where you can get the richest, most lavish meal in town and chances are that he will point you to one of the capital's highly-popular Georgian restaurants. While much of Russia's daily cooking revolves around cabbages, beets, potatoes and turnips, that of Georgia, taking advantage of productive soil and a warm climate, is a far more exotic affair. Italians, Turks, Greeks, Moroccans and Frenchmen might all be excused for finding elements of their own cuisine in the area's rich fare. Georgian cooking is, however, unique. Georgians are great meat-eaters but their classic dishes, based on lamb, pork and chicken, are enlivened by additions of great variety and contrast. Georgians are not afraid to combine many different tastes in one individual dish. Take, for example, the popular dish pkhali - minced spinach mixed with ground walnut paste, vinegar, garlic and spices, the whole topped with tart pomegranate seeds. The result, incongruous as it might seem, is delicious. Nor do Georgians shirk from serving highly different dishes at the same table at the same time. Ground hazelnut stuffings; delicate spicings of basil, coriander or tarragon; meat dishes set off by pomegranates and plums; fiery sauces of chilli peppers and garlic; cooling preparations of yoghurt and mint; mille feuille pastries dripping with honey - typically, all will be found at one time at the same Georgian meal. Individual courses, in fact, have no place in Georgia. What is crucial - an expression of the Georgian exuberance for abundance, generosity and sharing  -is that the table is covered from one end to the other. Loaded with serving bowls, platters, tureens, heaped plates, bottles of all descriptions and glasses that are never empty, it must creak with the sheer weight of food and drink. More than 7,000 ft high in the mountains and a 14-hour, spine-rattling Jeep ride from Tbilisi, Ushguli largely is cut off from the rest of the world and, on the whole, remains as self-sufficient in food as it does in everything else. Snowed-in for most of the year, and with only the shortest of summer growing seasons, the village cares as little for such normal Georgian delicacies as stuffed baby aubergines as it does for communist theories of collective production; neither has much role in this rude and demanding climate where families rely on their own efforts to survive. What counts instead in these high mountain valleys, and has counted since the bovine religious cults of pre-Christian times, is cattle breeding and the products that come from it. Stocky cattle farmer Kolia Nijaradze did not slaughter an entire cow when we pitched up, tired and hungry, in Ushguli; such an operation is reserved for special festivals and involves the whole community. But visits to Ushguli are rare, and guests honoured there. Shortly after we were taken into the warm kitchen of Kolia's solid, stone-built house, his daughter disappeared out the back door with a long knife and a large tub of boiling water. The terrific, high-pitched squealing that broke out a minute later ended in a sudden, ominous silence; before long, a good-sized baby pig, its skin scalded of bristles and its throat sewn-up neatly with thread, was baking in a cast-iron stove that was stoked until it glowed red. Suckling pig, wild mushrooms fried with mountain herbs; a fresh, mint-sprinkled, mozzarella-like cheese swimming in a bowl of warm milk; various pork organs simmering in a hot pepper stew; newly-baked bread with yet more cheese cooked and melted inside - this is only some of the fare that appeared on the table when, along with Kolia's brothers, cousins, father, uncle and friends, we sat down to dine. I remember discussing mountain trout-fishing with Kolia's cousin, and wild goat-hunting with his father. But at this point my recollection of the conversation, and the meal itself, grows somewhat hazy. By the time the second bottle of vodka had been opened and we had toasted St George, patron saint of both Georgia and England, I was feeling elated and ready to give up life in the West, marry Kolia's red-cheeked daughter, and settle down in Ushguli. After we had finished the fourth bottle and elaborated numerous toasts to international friendship, I realised what I was up against - not only eaters, but also drinkers of epic stature. A permanent life in Ushguli, I saw, might prove strenuous. Some time after the fifth bottle of vodka, when we had moved on to toasting our genes and future generations and were beginning to limber-up our voices for a little counterpoint, I had to admit I was no match for the Georgians, and conceded. Stumbling upstairs and falling into bed, I found myself thinking of the five lusty octogenarians singing in that little Tbilisi restaurant. How, if this was the kind of life they had led one decade after another, had those elderly gentlemen survived so long? Was it possible to over-eat, over-drink and over-smoke oneself into vigorous old age? The secrets of Georgian longevity have yet to be revealed, and more investigation is needed. But given the boundless nature of Georgian hospitality and the pleasures of the table there, there can be no lack of researchers. Having barely recovered from my first bout of inquiries, I drifted off in happy contemplation of further intensive study just a short night and a sunrise away.</p>

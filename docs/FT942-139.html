			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Not well known as a bank Sir, I thought you might be interested in an experience illustrating the fame of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. During a brief stay in London, I tried to look up a friend at the EBRD. Having lost his card, with the bank's address and telephone number, I took the tube to Moorgate and asked an underground employee for EBRD's whereabouts. Understandably, perhaps, he could not help me, but sensibly sent me to ask at the closest branch of National Westminster Bank. They would surely know. Alas, the lady at the information desk looked mystified: 'European Bank - for what? Well, let's look at our handbook.' She reached for a professional register of London banks. Her assurance swiftly waned as she looked at me doubtfully. 'Your European bank is not here.' Becoming impatient, I begged her to look in a normal London telephone directory. She disappeared, returning after a lengthy delay with the yellow pages. I already guessed her response: there was no European bank under 'banks and financial institutions'. At this point, I tried the normal telephone directory information service. One short call and I had my number. So it is not that the EBRD is completely unknown in London: it is just no bank. . . ] Christian Deubner. Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik, Haus Effenberg, D-82067 Ebenhausen, Germany</p>

			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Output rise boosts pound and hope of firm growth THE SHARPEST monthly rise in manufacturing output for four years has strengthened hopes for a sustained UK recovery. The 1.8 per cent increase in May output was almost 10 times stronger than market expectations, and points to robust economic expansion in the second quarter. The rise was the highest since April 1989. It was fuelled by buoyant car, computer and metals production, but the Central Statistical Office said that the late May bank holiday had possibly inflated the monthly figure. The underlying trend, however, continued to show a healthy rise. In the latest three months, output grew by 2.1 per cent compared with the previous quarter, and was 3 per cent up on the same period a year ago. The news sent the pound sharply higher against the D-Mark and the dollar. Sterling closed 1 1/2 pfennigs higher at DM2.57 and rose 1 1/2 cents to end the day at Dollars 1.4935. In New York the pound closed at Dollars 1.49775 and in late trading was at DM2.5735. UK share and government bond prices were largely unchanged, treating the figure as erratic after the CSO warning to regard the monthly figure cautiously. The FT-SE share index closed up 6.2 at 2,837.1, with dealers worried that chances of an early interest rate cut were fading. In the government bond market, an initial fall corrected itself, leaving prices only marginally lower by the close. Traders said any price weakness reflected technical pressures from weaker European markets rather than a substantial shift of opinion on UK economic prospects. The figures are likely to reinforce the hopes of Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, that a strong recovery will reduce the need for tax increases to tackle the budget deficit. In the House of Commons, Mr John Major, the prime minister, said the figures were 'clearly very good news indeed'. 'But it is only one of a large number of signs that the economy is recovering. Retail sales are up, car registrations are up, confidence is up, and unemployment is down,' he said. Yesterday's figures cheered Tory MPs, still divided over the Maastricht treaty and faced with unpopular policies such as imposing value added tax on domestic fuel. Most Conservatives believe there will be a chance to ease their political difficulties only when people become convinced the recession is over. The CSO said all manufacturing sectors, other than food, drink and tobacco, showed an even output growth in the latest three months. Total industrial production, which includes energy and water supply, rose 2 per cent month-on-month and was up 0.4 per cent in the latest three months compared with the previous quarter.

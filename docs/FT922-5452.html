			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Arts: 18th century opera - Record Review Andre Campra, Idomenee, William Christie and the Arts Florissants, French Harmonia Mundi, HMC 901396/7/8, 3 CDs Andre Campra used for his Idomenee a text by Antoine Danchet on which, 60 years later, Varesco based his libretto for Mozart's Idomeneo. Campra's opera, as may be imagined, does not have the musical richness or dramatic sweep of Mozart's masterpiece. Yet, as this recording shows it can stand on its own feet, a fine example of the tragedie lyrique, the formerly scorned art-form, now re-examined and restored to grace. Campra, the Provencal who had a long and successful career in Paris as composer of church music and operas, was a leading figure of the period between Lully and Rameau. There are interesting differences. Mozart's ending, if not exactly happy, is peaceful. Campra's Idomeneus persuades himself that Neptune will absolve him of his vow if he gives up the throne, but Nemesis warns that the sea-god is implacable. Idomeneus loses his reason, slays his son, tries to kill himself but is prevented. His punishment is to remain alive. One crucial scene is rather better managed in the earlier opera - the moment when Idomeneus realises the stranger he must kill is his son Idamante. Mozart shortened the scene because the Munich singers were poor actors. Danchet and Campra, in the later (1731) version given here, lengthened theirs because the Paris singer-actors were so good. Electra emerges as the most rounded character. She has nothing so sensational to sing as her Mozartian counterpart, but her slow, sad, siciliana-like solo 'Aimable esperance', at the point where Mozart placed his barcarolle chorus, is a beautiful, surprising piece, admirably sung by Sandrine Piau. Her sympathetic voice makes the efficient Ilione (Ilia) of Monique Zanetti sound shrill by comparison. The bass Bernard Deletre and the high tenor Jean-Paul Fouchecourt are well contrasted as the wretched king and his son. Jerome Correas takes four roles: his vituperative Jealousy is enjoyable. So is Mary Saint-Palais in the showy ariette in the last act. Some of the soloists begin so nervously (they recover) that retakes would have been justified. Campra was a thorough professional. All the facets of the style are brightly polished. He had a pleasing gift for melody and was a dab hand at dance music, of which there is plenty. Christie and his orchestra and chorus perform with their usual high definition and rhythmic salt. Idomenee is much more than an archaeological exercise. Jean-Phillipe Rameau, Pygmalion and Nelee et Myrthis , William Christie and the Arts Florissants, HMC 901381,1 CD Changing to Rameau for Christie and the Arts Florissants' other recordings, the two 'actes de ballet', Pygmalion and Nelee et Myrthis, reveal a higher plane of stimulation and invention. Rameau wrote a number of these one-acters - they are the equivalent more or less of one 'entree' of a big opera-ballet. Pygmalion has been recorded before, by Leonhardt, and was in the repertory of Kent Opera. The music crackles with surprises, from the overture with the tapping of the sculptor's chisel to the mini-divertissement during which the statue which Pygmalion loves, and which Amor has helped bring to life, is taught to dance. The expert high tenor Howard Crook is the sculptor, Sandrine Piau is Amor, Donatienne Michel-Dansac the statue. Nelee et Myrthis, is a brief anecdote about a victorious athlete, Nelee who puts Myrthis' love for him to the test. It contains expressive short airs, dialogue admirably set in recitative and, like Pygmalion, it broadens out towards the ends. Jerome Correas is the (unusually) low-voiced hero; Agnes Mellon, in good form, is Myrthis; Francoise Semellaz sings Corinne, who pretends to steal Nelee. These carefully fashioned 'actes de ballet' are no more minor works than, say, Bach's church cantatas, of which they form a kind of profane counterpart. Jean-Joseph Cassanea de Mondonville, Titon et l'Aurora, Marc Minkowski and the Musicians du Louvre, Ertao Musifrance 2292-45715-2, 2 CDs De Mondonville was a mid-18th century musician of wide activity. He wrote stage works, motets and chamber music and held the post of intendant to the Chapel Royal. His 'heroic pastoral' Titon et l'Aurora was produced in 1753 at the Opera in Paris with Marie Fel and the tenor Jelyotte. Titon is a shepherd in love with the goddess Aurora. There is another couple anxious to destroy their happiness and briefly and unsuccessfully joining forces to do so - the wood-nymph Pales and the wind-god Aeolus (classless society]). The work runs most pleasantly on the lines laid down so securely by Lully many years before. There is a feeling that baroque is yielding to rococo. The performance was recorded live in the Rheims Theatre by Marc Minkowski and the Musicians du Louvre, stimulating as usual. The Ensemble vocal Francoise Herr provides the chorus. Jean-Paul Fouchecourt's Titon is distinguished. As Aurora, Catherine Napoli is agile and a little thin-toned (all these records leave a suspicion behind that light French sopranos are reverting to old ways). As Aeolus, Philippe Huttenlocher adopts a comic voice which does not disguise unsteadiness. Jennifer Smith's Pales brings a note of genuine comedy and her tone is not thin.</p>

An indefinite closure on  the entire West Bank and the Gaza Strip went into effect this  morning. Meanwhile, Palestinian leaders in the territories are  demanding that the question of Jewish settlements be put at the  top of the agenda, before peace talks resume. Mark Weiss  reports:    In what appears to be the first stage of the expected crack  down on the extremist fringe within the settler community,  security forces detained overnight a number of Jewish residents  of Hebron. Residents of Qiryat Arba' also reported that soldiers  came to detain Kakh leaders Barukh Marzel and No'am Federman,  but the two managed to escape.    An indefinite closure went into effect at 0300 this morning  on the whole of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Palestinians are  not being allowed to enter Israel until further notice.    Shots were fired at an Army patrol north of Bayt Hanun in  Gaza this morning. An Army jeep was hit, but none of the  soldiers were injured. The troops returned fire and launched a  search for the attackers.    In a second consecutive day of violence in the territories,  three Palestinians were killed yesterday and dozens wounded.  There were also riots throughout Arab areas inside Israel.  More than 40 people were arrested in Nazareth, and in Yafo  hundreds of rioters attacked police and damaged Jewish property.    The head of Fatah in the West Bank, Faysal al-Husayni, says  he is recommending to PLO leaders in Tunis to continue the peace  process, providing that the issue of Jewish settlements is  placed at the top of the agenda. Al-Husayni said that the  Hebron massacre has created a new reality, and the Declaration  of Principles, drawn up in Oslo, is no longer valid. [passage  omitted]</p>

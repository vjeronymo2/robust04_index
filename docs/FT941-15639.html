			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Syria 'puts US links ahead of Israeli peace' President Hafez al-Assad of Syria is seriously pursuing peace with Israel but will have to clarify his intentions concerning security arrangements and political ties if negotiations are to succeed, Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, said yesterday. In an interview ahead of Sunday's Geneva summit between Mr Assad and US President Bill Clinton, the 70-year-old veteran Israeli politician said the Syrian leader's priority was improving relations with the US and that peace with Israel was a by-product. The US keeps Syria on a blacklist of nations supporting international terrorism, obliging the US administration to vote against international loans to Damascus. 'Assad would like to make a comeback in the international arena with the opportunity to be helped financially, so his best address is Washington,' Mr Peres said. 'Assad, like everybody else who looks to the next century, knows we have come to the end of the hunting season.' Mr Peres's remarks reflect a widespread view among senior Israeli analysts that the summit will help unlock Syrian-Israeli peace talks, which for more than two years have been more like pre-negotiations. Syria is demanding the return of all the Golan Heights, the strategic plateau captured by Israel in the 1967 Six Day War. Israel has said it will withdraw 'on' the Golan, not 'from' the Golan, but has consistently refused to spell out its territorial offer until Damascus commits itself to a full peace with Israel, including open borders, trade and diplomatic relations, and comprehensive security guarantees. The normally optimistic Mr Peres, however, believes the negotiations with Syria will be complicated and could take some time because of the sensitive geographical, security and geo-political implications of peace. 'Assad must understand that as he demands territory from Israel he must be crystal clear about his intentions on security and relations,' Mr Peres said. 'Peace cannot be just a greeting card at Christmas.' Mr Peres stressed the importance of secret diplomacy and the involvement of the US and said he was unsure if agreement could be reached this year. 'We have to see first what Assad has in his pocket.' Mr Peres's caution is echoed by many other Israeli 'Syria watchers'. Mr Arye Shalev, a former general and now an analyst at the Jaffee Strategic Studies centre at Tel Aviv University, said peace with Syria would have to be deeper than the peace reached in 1979 with Egypt. 'It must be a real peace between people, rather than between leaders,' he said. Mr Shalev believes that, from a military point of view, Israel must retain a 2km-3km strip of the Heights to protect Israel's northern valleys from attack and defend the Jordan River headwaters, which drain into the Sea of Galilee and provide Israel with 30 per cent of its water needs. He says such a strip could be negotiated under a leaseback deal and is vital to prevent a repetition of an incident in 1965, when Syria tried to divert the Jordan's waters to a reservoir, or the 1967 and 1973 wars. Other Israeli analysts are less optimistic about negotiations, pointing to Syria's strategic relations with Iran, its involvement with Palestinian groups opposed to peace, and the nature of Mr Assad's regime, which has justified years of political oppression and economic stagnation on the need to be mobilised against the 'Zionist enemy'. However, despite the difficulties, most Israelis accept that a comprehensive Middle East peace will depend on progress with Syria. They believe Syria dictates policy to Lebanese officials negotiating peace with Israel and influences Jordan. On peace talks with the Palestinians, Mr Peres said the PLO had made a tactical error to argue over every point blocking implementation of the agreement for self rule in the Gaza Strip and Jericho. The Palestinians were losing time as all issues would be re-opened when talks began within months on extending self-rule to the rest of the West Bank and within two years on a permanent solution. 'The Palestinians should remember this is an interim within an interim and they can come back later and negotiate further,' he said.</p>

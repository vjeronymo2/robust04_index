			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / International Company News: Japan's steel groups slash profit forecasts JAPAN'S leading steel makers yesterday announced sharp downward revisions of profit estimates for the first half to end-September, and they are likely apply for government subsidies to help cover the cost of transferring and retraining idled workers. Nippon Steel, the country's largest producer, forecast a 74.6 per cent fall in pre-tax profit to Y14bn, (Dollars 113.8m) compared to the same period last year, and said the effects of the government's just-announced emergency economic package would come too late to bolster profits this year. Other makers expect similar profit falls, with Kobe Steel down from Y18.9bn last year to Y6bn, Kawasaki Steel's profit to be halved to Y4bn, Sumitomo Metal Industries down from Y22.2bn to Y4bn, and NKK falling from Y14.1bn to Y5bn. The industry is suffering because of falling sales to most of its leading customers, including the car, construction, and consumer electronics industries, and because streamlining programmes begun in the mid-1980s were derailed during the easy money era of the late 1980s. An application for government subsidies would signal a return to streamlining, as the last application was made after appreciation of the yen prompted a sharp fall in crude steel production in 1986. However, demand rose in 1990, as domestic car sales soared and speculative developers fuelled construction orders. The downturn over the past year has also highlighted unwise diversifications made by steel makers attempting to employ idle workers in ventures ranging from amusement parks to bicycle factories. Companies have been forced to review those investments, and it appears likely that workers will be retrenched over the next year. Nippon Steel said sales for the first half are likely to fall 6.4 per cent to Y1,190bn, while pre-tax profit for the full-year is expected to fall 60 per cent to Y40bn on a 9 per cent fall in sales to Y2,400bn. The company's crude steel production is forecast to fall 14 per cent in the first half. 'We should feel some effects of the economic package, but a real recovery will not come until next fiscal year. Crude steel production in the second half is likely to be a bit higher than in the first half,' Nippon Steel said. Steel companies are expected to benefit from a rise in public works investment as part of the Y10,700bn economic package announced in August in an attempt to revive the ailing economy. But it is unclear whether the package will stabilise crude steel demand. Kobe said sales are likely to fall 6 per cent in the first half, while Kawasaki is expecting sales of Y550bn, down from Y592bn. Sumitomo predicted sales would fall from Y569bn to Y520bn. However, NKK's sales are still forecast to rise slightly from Y596bn to Y600bn.</p>

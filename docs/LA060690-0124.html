			<p><P> June 6, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE;  </P> <P> SCHOOL GIVEN TREE TO REPLACE STOLEN ONE  </P> <P> Although thieves struck Prospect Elementary School in Orange three times in one  month, taking mostly video recorders, everyone figured the 4-foot pine tree  planted for Earth Day last month would be safe.  </P> <P> Wrong.  </P> <P> The sun had not even set on the day of the tree-planting ceremony when two  students saw a man dig up the tree on the school field between the backstops,  put it into a blue and white full-size pickup truck and drive off.  </P> <P> "The tree was like the straw that broke the camel's back," said Principal Carol  Stiff. "You can't even plant a tree without somebody stealing it."  </P> <P> Unable to find the thief, police detectives were as disappointed as the  children.  </P> <P> "They feel bad for these kids," said Orange police Sgt. Bob Gustafson. "Our  detectives said, 'This is a shame.' "  </P> <P> The detectives met with the Orange Police Assn., which decided to seek a tree  donor. They found their philanthropist: a man with the unlikely name of Joe  Grumbles. He is owner of the Tustin Meadow Nursery.  </P> <P> Grumbles agreed to give the school a $200, 2-foot Brazil pepper tree, which  will be dedicated in another ceremony at 9 a.m. on Monday.  </P> <P> But this time, the tree will be planted inside the wrought iron gates of the  school.  </P> <P> And, according to Gustafson, "Chaining down the tree this time will definitely  be a consideration."

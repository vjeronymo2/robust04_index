			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Indian arms talks in Moscow A senior military delegation from India arrived in Moscow yesterday for talks on co-operation with Russia and possible aircraft purchases, Itar-Tass news agency reported. The delegation, led by air force Commander-in-Chief S K Kaul, would meet senior defence ministry and arms industry officials during the one-week visit and examine the latest models of Russian combat aircraft. 'He (Kaul) is also likely to negotiate purchases of MiG-29 fighter-bombers and SU-30 multi-purpose fighters,' the agency said, adding that India might consider buying a licence to make SU-30s. The two sides will also discuss modernisation of MiG-21 fighters in service with the Indian air force and creation of a joint Russian-Indian aircraft venture, Tass said, quoting an Indian embassy official. Russia and India agreed to step up military co-operation in a joint declaration signed by President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao during a visit by the latter to Moscow last month. Russia was India's biggest arms supplier in the Soviet era, but sales have slumped since then.</p>

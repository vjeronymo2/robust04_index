According to the decision adopted by the session,  an important and pressing basic task before us is to make  strenuous efforts to establish a large, unified, open,  competitive, and orderly market [tong yi kai tang jing zheng you  xu da shi cheng 4827 0001 7030 2397 4552 3630 2589 1645 1129  1579 1034].    A market system is the core of the market economic system  and  the base where the role of the market mechanism can be brought  into play. Without a perfect market for commodities and  essential factors, the basic role of resources distributed by  the market will be out of the question. What kind of a market  do we intend to establish? To make it simple, it should have  the following features: Unified and not decentralized, open and  not closed, competitive and not monopolized, and orderly and not  confused.    Unified, open, competitive, and orderly are the essential  requirements of a market economy. Openness is the premise of  economic activities, competitiveness is the source of economic  efficiency, and rules are the guarantee for economic order.  Only when the market is unified, open, competitive, and orderly  can the role of the market mechanism be brought into play, can  the optimized distribution of resources be ensured, and can  vitality and efficiency of the economy be maintained.    Since reform and opening up, China's commodity market has  developed rapidly, the market for essential factors has been  nurtured, and the role of the market mechanism has been brought  into play in certain fields. However, we should admit that  China's market system is still at the initial stage, which  cannot meet the needs of the rapidly developing economy and  which has restrained the national economy as a whole like a  bottle neck. For this reason, it is necessary to accelerate the  pace of market building. The following three outstanding  problems should be resolved at present: Market decentralization,  market monopoly, and confused market order.  <H6>  I. </H6>   Market decentralization refers mainly to barriers erected  between regions. Some localities proceed from their partial  interests, restrict the activities of neighbors, practice local  protectionism, and limit the flow of commodities and resources.  When there is a short supply of a certain commodity or  resource, they try to restrict its outflow. When a certain  local commodity is unmarketable, they restrict the inflow of  fine quality commodities from other localities. The artificial  barriers hinder the flow of commodities and the establishment of  a unified market nationwide.    From a short-term point of view, the barriers may protect  the  interests of a certain locality and its enterprises. From a  long- term point of view, however, it will harm the interests of  that locality and its enterprises because such protectionism  runs counter to market rules, rejects competition, and plays a  negative role of protecting backwardness. A child cannot grow  up in its mother's bosom and an enterprise which has not  withstood storms will not be competitiveness. The establishment  of a unified market is the trend of the times. The sooner we  open up, the sooner we will benefit. Otherwise, we will suffer.  This has been proved by the practice of many localities. In  establishing a unified market, besides removing barriers erected  between the regions within the country, it is also necessary to  make preparations to connect our market with that of the world.  When China's status as signatory of GATT is resumed, we will  further open our market to the outside world. Only by taking  part in competition in the market without barriers as early as  possible can enterprises adapt themselves to the storms in the  domestic and international market.    The removal of barriers erected between regions does not  mean  that we do not want to develop regional markets. The  development of regional markets is not equivalent to erecting  barriers. A regional market is formed by the natural technical  features of commodities, regional production, and consumption  rather than by administrative and artificial barriers. We  should develop such a regional market, which will become a  component part of the unified national market. In market  building, the establishment of some regional markets in light of  administrative divisions is a normal phenomenon. As long as we  do not make such a market inflexible, it will conform to  economic laws and converge with a unified national market.    The key to breaking through regional barriers and  establishing a unified and open market lies in deepened reform.  On the one hand, acceleration of reform of the financial and  taxation system, implementation of a separate taxation system,  and transformation of the financial contract system can weaken  the foundation of interests of local protectionism, which will  help remove market barriers. On the other hand, acceleration of  enterprise reform, establishment of the enterprise bankruptcy  system and a social insurance system, and invigoration of  enterprise competitiveness in the market can alleviate the  pressure of the government in undertaking "protection"  responsibility. Naturally, the state must also adopt  legislative means to ensure that the market is open and to stop  the practice of erecting barriers.  <H6>  II. </H6>   Market monopoly refers mainly to monopoly by departments and  trades, monopoly by a unitary state economy, and monopoly  related to some outdated policies. Since reform, the structure  of China's departmental monopoly and of the public economic  sector unifying the whole country has been smashed. Other  economic sectors are now allowed to enter a number of fields and  nonpublic sectors are allowed to take part in economic  development and competition, which have enormously invigorated  these fields. Nevertheless, there are still some competitive  fields which are monopolized by some departments and nonpublic  enterprises are still restricted from operation in some fields.  It will be impossible to ensure fair competition if there is  inequality in fields where certain nonpublic enterprises are  allowed to enter. Moreover, to encourage some enterprises to  explore reform experience, the state offered some preferential  policies during the initial period of reform which were  absolutely necessary and which played an enormous role in  promoting reform and economic development. When the reform  measures are popularized, however, the continued retention of  the "preferential policies" for certain enterprises will be  unfair to the vast number of other enterprises. As such a  "monopoly which is related to policy" does not conform to the  establishment of a market which encourages fair competition, it  should be removed in the course of deepened reform.    The greatest harm of market monopoly is that it rejects  competition, which hinders nurturing of the market, reduces  economic efficiency, and gives rise to disorder and corruption.  In the course of the transition from a highly centralized  planned economy to a market economy, the most important and  arduous task is to smash monopolies. Naturally, while the state  must exercise a monopoly over a small number of special  commodities which are related to the lifelines of the national  economy, restrictions on other departments and economic sectors  should be lifted and they should be allowed to take part in  competition and promote development. Even in the trades where a  state monopoly is essential, it is necessary to introduce a  competition mechanism, carry out competition between  enterprises, and increase efficiency. In order to better  implement the policy of coexistence of various economic sectors  based on the predominance of the public sector and encourage the  normal growth of nonpublic sectors, it is necessary to effect a  shift from the basis of ownership to industrial needs in  formulating policies, abolish discriminative and restrictive  policies, gradually recall special preferential policies  offered to certain enterprises during a specified period,  abolish monopoly policies, and ensure fair competition. In  order to weaken and eventually remove the powers of resource  distribution of certain government departments, it is necessary  to increase the scope of government reform and change the  functions of government organs so they can shift from  microeconomic activities to comprehensive management and  delegate powers to the market and enterprises. The state should  also formulate anti- monopoly laws and protect competition.  Some comrades are worried that the lifting of restrictions on  the market and elimination of the monopoly of the public  economic sector will shake the position of socialist public  ownership. The predominance of socialist public ownership  should be manifested in the national economy and control over  the lifelines of the national economy rather than the  superiority in the quantity of state enterprises or the  undertaking of all trades and professions by state enterprises.  Only by eliminating monopoly and encouraging the common  development of various economic sectors can we arouse the  enthusiasm of all fields to resolve the difficulties of capital  shortages in China's construction and promote economic  prosperity. Although the individual and private economic  sectors have developed rapidly in recent years, they are still  insufficient. The output value of the individual and private  enterprises in China accounted for only 4.1 percent of the  country's total industrial output value in 1992. Therefore,  there is still a wide scope for their development.    Competition requires a certain scale. In other words, there  must be a considerable number of enterprises in each trade.  Only when there is a large scale of competition can we have  full competition and give play to its role. In China, which has  a vast territory, large population, and huge market, it will be  impossible to meet market needs without competition of scale.  Competition is also conducive to economy of scale because we  can allow the best to survive through competition, merge  enterprises and concentrate assets, and form an economy of  scale. Such economy of scale will be the result of competition  on equal footing. As it is not "a plate of assorted dishes  pieced together" by force, which rejects competition, it will  inevitably turn out genuine efficiency of scale.  <H6>  III. </H6>   The confused market order at present has attracted public  attention. The chaotic phenomena of counterfeit goods, short  measures, false advertisements, illegal pooling of funds, tax  evasion, and smuggling have disrupted normal market order, given  rise to corruption, and harmed the interests of enterprises and  the masses. A special feature of the chaotic phenomena is not  keeping promises, not observing to rules, and defying laws and  discipline. Some people say that this is the result of a market  economy, which is a complete misunderstanding of the market  economy. A market economy is not an economy without order. A  market economy is an economy which adheres to rules and the  legal system. In the course of a market economy, the market  body is diversified, economic policy decisions are  decentralized, and economic connections are complicated. To  ensure effective operation and fair and full competition of the  economy, it is necessary to strictly establish market rules and  effectively maintain market order. The practice of many  developed nations has proved this point. They have used a  mature market economy to overcome the initial deficiencies of a  commodity economy.    The establishment of a socialist market economic system is  an unprecedented cause. The occurrence of the chaotic phenomena  will be unavoidable in a change of the system from the old to  the new. The substitution of a new system for the old one and  the frictions between the two will inevitably result in  management loopholes, a vacuum in regulations, lax discipline,  and misbehavior. As the chaotic phenomenon is due to  insufficient rather than excessive development of the market  economy, the problem can be fundamentally resolved only through  accelerating reform and expediting market growth. He who  carries out full competition by following the principle of  fairness, honesty, and trustworthiness is the most effective  defender of a market order. The abolition of market monopoly,  barriers, and inappropriate means of competition will fully  develop competition and exert great market pressure on  enterprises. Enterprises will have internal binding force by  speeding up the reform of the enterprise system and genuinely  developing a mechanism of assuming sole responsibility for  profits and losses. The establishment of market rules,  strengthening of market management, and enhancement of a sense  of trustworthiness, contract, and law will plug loopholes and  further restrain enterprise behavior and standardize market  order.    Concrete analysis should be made of the chaotic phenomena.  It is necessary to resolutely resist the chaotic phenomena as  they run counter to the basic rules of a market economy. Some  phenomena are regarded as "disorder" from the traditional  planned economic viewpoint, but economic vitality and the bud of  a new system from a market economic viewpoint, which should be  vigorously supported and not contained. Although some phenomena  are related to "chaos," they are caused by market stagnation,  reflecting the needs of accelerating market development, which  must be standardized and guided rather than simply negated. For  example, the chaotic phenomenon of illegal lending which took  place in the financial field was a reflection of the capital  market stagnation, which can only be effectively resolved by  vigorously enhancing the building of the capital market. In  short, we should learn how to apply the method of a market  economy to curb the chaos and introduce reforms rather than  restriction for the chaotic phenomena. With the checking of the  chaotic phenomena as the opportunity, we should accelerate the  pace of reform, smash the vicious cycle of "opening up resulting  in chaos, chaos in restriction, and restriction in rigidity,"  and enter a new realm of orderly development. Market oriented  reform has boosted the economy and improved the people's living  standards. China's economy has never been so vigorous and the  market has never been so prosperous as the one today. Despite  the chaos amid vitality, vitality is essential. We may say that  the chaotic phenomenon is the price paid for reform and  development and that there can be no success without a price.  With the spirit of holding ourselves highly responsible to the  people, we should work conscientiously, be bold as well as  prudent, and try to exchange the greatest success for the least  price.    As this year is a crucial one for implementing the decision  of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee,  we should be determined to make strenuous efforts to promote  reform in a down-to-earth manner; earnestly resolve the problems  of market barriers, monopoly, and chaos; remove obstacles in  market building; and push the market forward in a unified, open,  competitive, and orderly direction.</p>

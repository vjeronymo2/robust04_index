We accelerated the pace of fixed-asset  investment, and our key construction projects progressed  smoothly. Our market was prosperous, and our commodities sold  well. New progress was made in opening up to the outside world,  and use of foreign capital was increased by a wide margin.  Urban and rural residents continued to increase their incomes,  and people's living standards were further enhanced. New  progress was been made in various reforms. The building of  spiritual civilization was further strengthened, and various  social undertakings developed vigorously. Finally, the  anticorruption struggle was carried out in key areas in a  directed and guardual way so as to further promote the work of  establishing clean and honest administration.

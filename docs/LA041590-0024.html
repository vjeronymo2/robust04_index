			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE VOTING LINE: CLASSIC BOWIE AND CHARITY  </P> <P> A rebuttal to the April 8 Pop Eye column: David Bowie has not sold out, as the  column implied, by setting up a 900 line for fans to vote for songs that he  should perform in his upcoming U.S. concert tour. All profits from the 900  request number go to the Save the Children charity.  </P> <P> In regard to the attempt of the British publication New Musical Express to  prompt Bowie to sing "The Laughing Gnome" by "fixing" the telephone voting:  Bowie was originally going to perform the song in concert until he (I quote  from a Melody Maker interview) "found out all the voting had been a scam . . .  perpetrated by another music paper . . . that was an end to that. I can't  pander to the press, can I?"  </P> <P> As a result of what Pop Eye called Bowie's "crass" phone line, concert-goers in  the United Kingdom are being treated to obscure classics like "Queen Bitch, Be  My Wife, Stay" that he otherwise would not have played.  </P> <P> KEITH FOX  </P> <P> Diamond Bar  </P> <P>  A media spokesman for Bowie's tour confirmed that the 900 number in the United  States will benefit Save the Children. Callers to 900 numbers are billed a fee  in excess of the normal toll charges.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Reflecting section 412(a)(1)(A)(iv) of the INA, the Director of ORR expects States to ``insure that women have the same opportunities as men to participate in training and instruction.'' In addition, States are expected to make sure that services are provided in a manner that encourages the use of bilingual women on service agency staffs to ensure adequate service access by refugee women. In order to facilitate refugee self-support, the Director also expects States to implement strategies which address simultaneously the employment potential of both male and female wage earners in a family unit. States and counties are expected to make every effort to assure availability of day care services in order to allow women with children the opportunity to participate in employment services or to accept or retain employment. To accomplish this, day care may be treated as a priority employment-related service under the targeted assistance program. Refugees who are participating in TAP-funded or social services-funded employment services or have accepted employment are eligible for day care services. For an employed refugee, TAP-funded day care must be limited to one year after the refugee becomes employed. States and counties, however, are expected to use day care funding from other publicly funded mainstream programs as a prior resource and are encouraged to work with service providers to assure maximum access to other publicly funded resources for day care.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Targeted assistance services should be provided in a manner that is culturally and linguistically compatible with a refugee's language and cultural background. In light of the increasingly diverse population of refugees who are resettling in this country, refugee service agencies will need to develop practical ways of providing culturally and linguistically appropriate services to a changing ethnic population. To the maximum extent possible, particularly during a refugee's initial years of resettlement, targeted assistance services should be provided through a refugee-specific service system rather than through a system in which refugees are only one of many client groups being served.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ORR strongly encourages States and counties when contracting for targeted assistance services, including employment services, to give consideration to the special strengths of MAAs, whenever contract bidders are otherwise equally qualified, provided that the MAA has the capability to deliver services in a manner that is culturally and linguistically compatible with the background of the target population to be served.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ORR defines MAAs as organizations with the following qualifications: a. The organization is legally incorporated as a nonprofit organization; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Not less than 51% of the composition of the Board of Directors or governing board of the mutual assistance association is comprised of refugees or former refugees, including both refugee men and women.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, in order to provide culturally and linguistically compatible services in as cost-efficient a manner as possible in a time of limited resources, ORR strongly encourages States and counties to promote and give special consideration to the provision of services through coalitions of refugee service organizations, such as coalitions of MAAs, voluntary resettlement agencies, or a variety of service providers. ORR believes it is essential for refugee-serving organizations to form close partnerships in the provision of services to refugees in order to be able to respond adequately to a changing refugee picture. Coalition-building and consolidation of providers is particularly important in communities with multiple service providers in order to ensure better coordination of services and maximum use of funding for services by minimizing the funds used for multiple administrative overhead costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The award of funds to States under this notice would be contingent upon the completeness of a State's application as described in section IX, below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 25 (515)] </F>   [Text] The Georgian government said that the processes now  underway in the Gali District of Abkhazia showed that the  Abkahzian leaders tried to thwart the Geneva talks on resolving  the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict.    The Georgian government said in a statement made public  Monday that it "is prepared to continue the search for a  political settlement through negotiations but will take every  step to protect Georgian citizens in the area which is occupied  today by separatists and their protectors."    The document accuses what it described as "certain political  quarters in Russia" of "virtually provoking the Gudauta leaders  into a new escalation of barbarism" by rejecting a comprehensive  treaty between Georgia and Russia.</p>

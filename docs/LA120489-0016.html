			<p><P> December 4, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CAUSE OF CHULA VISTA JAIL BRAWL SOUGHT  </P> <P> More than 100 inmates at the County Jail in Chula Vista remained locked down in  their cells Sunday night as jailers continued to investigate a brawl that sent  four inmates to the hospital Saturday.  </P> <P> The fight erupted about 10 p.m. in a medium-security cellblock, Module 1A,  after two inmates had a disagreement, according to Sgt. Paul Nevills of the San  Diego County Sherriff's Department. Soon 25 to 30 inmates joined the fray, he  said, and, by the time deputies broke up the fight, three inmates had been  stabbed and one had a broken hand.  </P> <P> The jail, which was designed to hold 192 inmates, housed about 900 over the  weekend. On Saturday, jailers decided that all inmates would remain locked in  their cells until the cause of the brawl was determined. By Sunday night,  however, only Module 1A was locked down.  </P> <P> "Everything's back to normal, except for that module," said Sgt. Chris Von  Olnhausen.  </P></p>

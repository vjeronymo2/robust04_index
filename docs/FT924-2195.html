			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / UK Gilts: Prices buoyed by news on inflation GILT prices were buoyed by better than expected news on inflation, although a continuation of the obdurate stance by the Bundesbank on interest rates reduced demand for short-dated bonds. In thin trading, prices for the UK securities mainly moved sideways. However on Friday gilts moved up by 1 point at one stage on news that the retail price index rose by just 3 per cent in the 12 months to November, its lowest year-on-year increase in six years. A day earlier, the Bundesbank council, as expected, failed to cut its interest rates due to continuing worries about high German inflation sparked by unification and soaring government deficits. The lack of action on German monetary policy lifted the D-Mark against most European currencies, including the pound. Even though sterling is no longer formally tied to the D-Mark, Bank of England and Treasury officials are thought to be extremely nervous about the possibility of the pound falling much below its current level of around DM2.45. As a result officials are expected not to want to run the risk of the pound falling by sanctioning any further reduction in base rates, now 7 per cent. While short-term interest rates in the UK appear to be unlikely to see any imminent changes, investor interest in purchasing short dated gilts is expected to be lukewarm. As well as worrying about the level of the pound, the Bank and the Treasury are also thought to be cautious about sanctioning a further cut in base rates on the grounds that there are small signs of a pick-up in economic activity. Many politicians and industrialists would welcome a further cut in UK rates, which have come down by 3 percentage points since September when Britain left the European exchange rate mechanism. But before deciding on any further action on interest rates government officials will probably want to wait for further news as to how overall UK demand might have increased as a result of the easing in economic policy since sterling's devaluation. With yields for short-maturing securities pushed up a fraction last week by the lack of strong expectations about base rate cuts in the near future, the focus switched to the longer end of the yield curve. Gilts in this part of the bond spectrum held out some attraction for investors, particularly after Friday's inflation news. This class of securities saw some buying pressure after the inflation numbers showed the continuing weakness of demand at the retail level in the UK, a development likely to be good for gilts over the next few months. The year on year increase in the RPI in November - the headline number - showed a big decrease on the corresponding figure in the year to October of 3.6 per cent. Meanwhile, the Treasury's favoured measure of underlying inflation - the RPI less mortgage interest payments - saw a fall from 3.8 per cent in the 12 months to October to 3.6 per cent in the year to last month. That is a further sign that growth in the UK economy next year is likely to be weak, a factor that can be expected to boost demand for long-dated gilts. According to Mr Don Smith, an economist at Greenwell Montagu, figures for UK inflation are likely to be exceptionally important for the gilt market over the next few months, ahead of any surge in prices of imported goods sparked by sterling's devaluation. Emphasising the message that underlying inflation is continuing to fall rapidly, an index compiled by Greenwell Montagu of 'core inflation' fell from a year-on-year 3.4 per cent in October to a figure of just 3.1 per cent in November. In September the number had been 3.7 per cent. The fall in the core index - which is the RPI, excluding not only mortgage payments but prices of petrol, seasonal food, electricity, gas and other items deemed to be subject to erratic price variations - is a further indication of extremely weak demand for many classes of retail goods caused by the lingering recession.</p>

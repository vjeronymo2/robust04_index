			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Ex-colony preferences set to be wound down  -A review of the aid and trade treaty between the EU and African, Caribbean and Pacific countries As ministers from European Union governments and the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) group meet in Swaziland today to review the Lome Convention, they could be writing the first words of its epitaph. There is tacit agreement on both sides that the trade and aid treaty, in its present form, will be the last of its kind. There is disagreement, however, on the nature and extent of changes to the treaty, which expires at the end of the decade. The Lome Convention was once hailed as a model for trade treaties: it was negotiated, rather than being imposed by one side; and it was generous in the opportunities it offered the ACP countries. Its mid-term review comes at a time of increasing globalisation of world trade. The EU says it wants changes to the treaty that fit in with the redefined principles and patterns of commerce set out in the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. But ACP countries believe the Lome Convention is not yet anachronistic and that some of the proposed amendments are too radical. ACP officials admit that for many of their economies, disengaging from Lome in its present form would be painful. With the deregulation of international trade, and with changes in the patterns of private investment flows and official aid, guaranteed markets for commodity exports and development finance through the treaty are invaluable. While most agree that the crutch offered by preferences will go, they differ on the timing. Economies are weaned on trade preferences ostensibly to enable them to stand on their own. But senior officials at the European Commission say the longer preferences are in place the less able recipients are to stand unaided. And they argue that some countries have done better without preferential treatment at all. The EU wants to move away from considerations of special relationships based on colonial ties to a less emotional foundation for trade. The 'real needs' of developing countries are more important than their history, the EU argues. Most ACP governments agree, but they do not fully accept the EU's interpretation of the measures needed to meet those needs. The EU also wants changes in the management of its development funds to reduce delay, waste and corruption. It is seeking changes in the administration of aid to support human rights, 'good governance' and democracy, as reflected in more open government and increased accountability. ACP states say they are in favour of all this, but they question the EU's motive in introducing conditions which, they say, the Union does not demand in its relations with other states. There is concern in the ACP over what the EU would use as the final arbiter and how these principles can be coherently defined when dealing with varying political systems and cultures. ACP states want joint determination to avoid the danger of discriminating against some countries. Ministers will also argue over whether Brussels or the recipient states should have greater control over the management of aid funds. EU officials argue that countries should not expect continuing access to funds they fail to take up, and that disbursements should be denied if it believes money has been misspent. ACP states say in response that recipient governments do not always have complete control over the rate of spending and that the flow of funds often depends on tortuous decision-making in Brussels. They add that changes to control over aid could undermine relations between ACP states by provoking arguments over limited resources. ACP officials fear that some of what they consider the more pressing issues, such as trade in sugar and bananas and in services, may get pushed into the background.</p>

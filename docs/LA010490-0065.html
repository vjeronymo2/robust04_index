			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: WEST HOLLYWOOD;  </P> <P> HOMELESS SHELTER CONTINUED  </P> <P> Because of the delayed opening of its permanent homeless shelter, the West  Hollywood City Council has voted to continue the funding of a temporary shelter  in West Hollywood Park Auditorium for at least six more months.  </P> <P> The council voted 3 to 0 to take $96,000 from the city's budget for the  homeless and from unallocated reserves to keep the auditorium site open while  earthquake safety improvements are made at the permanent shelter at 1033 La  Brea Ave.  </P> <P> The money in the budget for the homeless was to have been used for operations  at the permanent shelter.  </P> <P> The council last year allocated money for the temporary shelter only through  December, anticipating that the La Brea building would be in operation at the  beginning of 1990. However, city officials then discovered that the permanent  shelter would need substantial improvements to bring it into compliance with  state earthquake safety codes.  </P> <P> City Manager Paul Brotzman said Tuesday that the La Brea shelter is unlikely to  open before the middle of this year.  </P></p>

			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / Germany 1992 Forecast: A year of transition - Some optimism may be justified in Germany The US and the world economies have had more than just a cold. Instead of the promised recovery in 1991, we have experienced a double dip. Consumer confidence is down and the business climate is chilly. Fiscal policy is incapacitated by high public deficits worldwide. Re-regulation by the Bank for International Settlements, and sound banking practices, helped restore profit margins in banking and prevented lower refinancing costs from being passed on to consumers and investors: monetary policy, expansionary for more than a year, now seems to have lost its effectiveness. Thus uncertainty increases as to whether the recession can be overcome in the foreseeable future. The German economy is perceived by Germans and international observers alike to have been almost completely separated from the worldwide slowdown by its unification process. Growth in 1989-90 and even at the start of 1991 was a remarkably high 4 per cent. By mid-1991 the business cycle started to tumble in western Germany, principally for three reasons: international demand was consistently weak; the impact of the Bundesbank's restrictive monetary policies; and the deflationary effects of big tax increases (amounting to 1.5 per cent of GNP) to meet the costs of unification. It took some time to realise this, because observers tend to analyse the German economy on the basis of year-on-year figures. On a quarter-to-quarter basis it is obvious the (west) German economy has - at best - been stagnating since mid-year. Now a growing number of pessimists are voicing their concerns. These Cassandras - especially after the recent increases in discount and Lombard rates - see Germany sliding into an outright recession. In the year ahead various cyclical and structural factors will be at work. The cyclical factors will produce more negative news, probably until mid-year. Thereafter net exports and fiscal impulses should support the recovery. The structural factors - with the exception of the repercussions of developments in the former Soviet Union - will foster prosperity. While doubts are mounting whether monetary expansion is still effective, I strongly believe that by early summer markets in north America and the UK will begin to recover. Prospects for German exports will have improved by then. But two obstacles stand in the way of such a change. First, a significant strengthening of the D-Mark against the dollar; and second, a substantial gain of market share on the part of Japanese and other south-east Asian companies as a result of aggressive international selling in the wake of a domestic slump in these countries. Another cyclical factor that will support the German recovery is the expiry by mid-1992 of the so-called 'unification tax' - the 7.5 per cent surcharge on income and corporate taxes designed to pay for unification. Since many arguments, particularly lower inflation, support an easing of German - and consequently European - monetary policy after mid-1992, the effects of monetary expansion will make themselves felt after the usual time lag of roughly two quarters. The Bundesbank's recent use of the interest rate whip has shown that its policy is likely to remain restrictive until mid-1992, as it considers current wage demands as excessive and inflation unacceptably high. Only then will the consumer price index (year-on-year) fall below 4 per cent. In the second half of the year the economy will also benefit from a (short-lived) stimulus due to advance purchases of consumer durables, resulting from VAT increases effective from January 1 1993. It is not yet clear whether Germany's tax amendment law - including, besides the VAT increase, cuts in some corporate taxes - will be passed by the Bundesrat (upper house). But even if the legislation is rejected, the planned tax package would still have some positive effects. It would, for instance, force the government to cut spending to slim the budget deficit. An unchanged VAT rate would mean a lower inflation rate in 1993. This could foster expectations of a further relaxation of monetary policy in 1993 and thus stimulate the economy. Investment activity will also be encouraged by the ongoing process of European integration and the creation of the European Economic Area (EEA). Besides, there are other structural factors supporting a more optimistic outlook for Germany. In east Germany the trough in economic activity has been reached. The economic take-off there will trigger strong investment growth. This dynamic demand for investment goods will to a large extent be met by deliveries from western Germany. A factor that went almost unnoticed will continue to lend strength to the German economy: namely, the continuing immigration which is increasing the country's labour force by about 1 per cent and its population by some 1.5 per cent a year. All in all, 1992 will be a year of transition. Since the start of the year will be poor, annual averages of growth will be unimpressive: economic activity in west Germany will increase by only 1 1/2 per cent, employment will be up by only 1 per cent rather than the 3 per cent achieved in 1991. Private investment will expand by only 3 per cent to 4 per cent rather than the double-digit numbers of the past three years. However, east German GNP is likely to expand by 10 per cent, after a decline of some 20 per cent last year. This should not be misread as a self-sustained, broadly based recovery, but rather as a bouncing back after a shake-out. But during the course of 1992 the economic pace should accelerate. In the period 1992-95 growth rates should be comparable to those of 1989-90. This medium-term forecast will look over-optimistic throughout most of 1992, since sentiment always lags behind facts by half a year. It will look ridiculously high over the next quarter, when business and consumer confidence reaches a trough by spring. Rough economic conditions during the winter do not bode well for forceful action to solve international problems, be it the Gatt, the former Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, or even the institutional completion of western Europe. Here Murphy's law may apply until the summer. But crises - or the perception of crisis - frequently give rise to a change in attitude. Some optimism may, therefore, be justified.

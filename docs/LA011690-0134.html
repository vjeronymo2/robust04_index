			<p><P> January 16, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: DREW BARRYMORE DETAILS HER LIFE -- ALL 14 YEARS  </P> <P> IS AGE 14 too young for one to be writing an autobiography? I suppose it isn't  if you are Drew Barrymore, whose book "Little Girl Lost" is bound to become one  of those hot reading experiences of the cautionary '90s. The beloved and  appealing little girl from the movie "E. T." took her first drink at 9, smoked  her first joint at 10 and began using cocaine at 12. The tabloids had a field  day with this Barrymore, just as yellow journalism in the past had a field day  with other illustrious members of her famous family. But Drew is surely the  youngest star ever to burst on the show biz scene, then fall quickly from  grace, then attempt suicide, then get her act together as a recovering addict.  </P> <P> Pocket Books encouraged Drew to tell her story, and she does in a  dishearteningly "adult" manner. This work could break your heart when it isn't  filling you with hopeless rage. Drew will be telling all on Oprah Winfrey's TV  show at the end of the month and says she has new perspectives to offer. Maybe  Drew has some advice for parents on how not to have their kids going haywire  before they are even in their teens.  </P> <P> THE ENORMOUSLY successful game show "Wheel of Fortune" has been taping at  Disney World in Florida, and the producers prove that they are a serious,  no-nonsense bunch. Last Sunday, Michael Jackson and his entourage suddenly  appeared on the set and asked to use the bathroom. (Michael was at Disney World  for the opening of the George Lucas "Star Wars" tour.) But the megastar was  told that the bathrooms were "for contestants only." Period.  </P> <P> So the Jackson gang was obliged to move on. At "Wheel of Fortune" it seems they  aren't impressed by Michael Jackson. After all, they have Vanna White.  </P> <P> DOES ANYBODY around here remember when Eddie Gilbert was the junior grade "Ivan  Boesky" of the '60s? Gilbert and his then wife, Rhoda, cut a wide social swath  in cafe society (before it went nouvelle). He changed his name from Ginsberg to  Gilbert and hired columnist Igor Cassini to promote him.  </P> <P> But in 1967, Gilbert went to jail for two years after pleading guilty to  embezzlement in matters concerning his hardwood flooring firm, E. L. Bruce  &amp; Co. Then, in the early '80s, Gilbert was back in jail for stock  manipulation. Now he is about to become a three-time loser. He will be  sentenced March 8 in the federal court by Judge Charles Haight, a top-rated  jurist of the Southern District of New York.  </P> <P> This time, the person who blew the whistle was writer Ken Geist. Ken had been  fascinated by the saga of Eddie Gilbert and wanted it to be a book. But at the  same time he handed over his own inheritance to Gilbert, which the latter  invested at a loss. The rules of Gilbert's probation restricted him from  engaging in any financial dealing. Now Eddie Gilbert has to pay the price.  </P></p>

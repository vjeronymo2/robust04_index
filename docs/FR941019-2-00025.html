			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The primary reason for delaying the addition of these gases is to aid in the efficient administration of this new program. Neither DOE nor EIA has sufficient experience in voluntary reporting to predict the volume of participation in this program or the difficulties that may arise in its implementation. EIA expects that experience gained in the first two years of the program will enhance its ability to smoothly accommodate this expansion of the reporting program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> b. Additional Gases to be Covered_Halogenated Substances <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comments were also received on the list of halogenated substances for which emissions and reductions will be reportable. In response to these comments, the final guidelines add two halogenated substances, halon 1211 and halon 2402, to the list of reportable gases. Given the limited amount of reporting anticipated on these substances, initial coverage of the program includes these gases. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As explained in the June 1994 notice of availability for the draft guidelines, the inclusion of some halogenated substances in the voluntary reporting program is based on the language of Section 1605(b)(1)(B), referring to the reportability of reductions in greenhouse gas emissions achieved through ``chlorofluorocarbon capture and replacement.'' Without this language, DOE might have limited the voluntary reporting program to those gases covered by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, thus excluding the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other halogenated substances, including the two halons now covered, from the reporting program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment noted that the draft guidelines' failure to list halon 1211 and halon 2402 as reportable gases was inconsistent with the listing of halon 1301. The draft guidelines and supporting materials listed only those halogenated substances for which the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) had published an index of global warming potential (GWP) relative to carbon dioxide. While there are internationally accepted indices of stratospheric ozone depletion potential for halogenated and bromide substances in addition to those listed in the draft guidelines and supporting documents, the IPCC published a GWP for halon 1301, but not for any other halon. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on stratospheric ozone depletion characteristics, the halogenated substances are covered by an international agreement, the Montreal Protocol on Substances Depleting the Stratospheric Ozone, and under U.S. law are regulated under Title VI of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. These gases are greenhouse gases, although they also have the antagonistic characteristic of destroying tropospheric ozone, which tends to indirectly produce global cooling. These antagonistic effects complicate the analysis of their impact on the global climate, and have divided the scientific community over whether the net effect of some of these gases will be global warming or cooling. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This division in the scientific community has made it difficult to determine the quantitative global warming potential of these gases. Because emissions data reported under the program will be reported in units of weight, and not reduced to a standard measure by application of a common index of comparative radiative effects, and to be consistent with the decision discussed above on conventional pollutants, halon 1211 and halon 2401 are added to the list of gases for which emissions may be reported under the program. Based on the limited amount of activity in production and use of these substances, and on the similarity in emissions of these substances to other halogenated substances, DOE has determined that there is no administrative need to delay acceptance of submissions on these gases. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Limitation on Vintage of Reportable Projects <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The General Guidelines include a new section, discussing the limitation on reporting projects which resulted in a reduction in emissions, but on which activity commenced before 1991. The final guidelines permit reporting as projects only new (post-1990) emissions reductions and carbon sequestration. Pre-1991 emissions reductions will be reflected in emissions reporting only. Thus, the results of all emission reduction activities which are first achieved in 1991 are reportable as projects, even if the activity commenced before 1991. For example, in the case of an ongoing demand side management program, emissions changes arising from energy savings through appliance replacement in 1991 can be reported as project results, but the effects of appliance replacements before 1991 are not reportable as emissions reduction projects. Rather, these effects are subsumed in emissions reporting for the baseline period of 1987 through 1990. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

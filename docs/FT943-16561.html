			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Arts: Today's Television You have to admire the tenacity of the people at Channel 4 (or groan at their pig headedness). 'The troubles' in Northern Ireland are known to be one of the greatest 'switch-off' subjects of all time. So what does Channel 4 do? Mounts an entire week of programmes on the subject to mark the 25th anniversary of British troops being deployed on the streets. Who knows, perhaps it will work. Loved Ones is a sequence of 26 two-minute films commemorating the victims of political violence (7.50). In The Last Colony Martin Dillon looks at the years between 1969 and 1972 when the armed stand-off developed (9.00). Beyond The Troubles finds former hostage Brian Keenan talking to people who have stepped beyond the confines of 'the long war' (11.00). The Visit is an award-winning half-hour drama about the wife of a Long Kesh prisoner (11.50). Wall To Wall is a new series about housing, from mud skyscrapers in Yemen to the cob cottages of Devon (7.30 BBC2). Room 101, inspired by the dreaded place in Orwell's 1984, is another new BBC2 series - the antithesis of Desert Island Discs (10.00).</p>

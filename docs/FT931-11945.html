			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Republicans get new chairman LAWYER and lobbyist Mr Haley Barbour was yesterday elected Republican national committee chairman as the outgoing party leader, Mr Rich Bond, went out with a blast at party anti-abortion 'zealotry.' Mr Barbour, 45, has a law office in Yazoo City, Mississippi and in Washington where he is a lobbyist-consultant. He was political director in the White House during the Ronald Reagan administration. He was elected on the third ballot, getting 90 of the 165 votes needed among the party leaders attending the meeting. Mr Barbour, who has served on the national committee since 1984, beat four rivals. It was the first contested election for Republican chairman since 1977, the last time Democrats moved into the White House for a four-year stay. In an outspoken farewell, Mr Bond said the anti-abortion stand that has divided Republicans for years should be scuttled so the party attracts people who believe in the woman's right to choose.</p>

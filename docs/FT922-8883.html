			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / International Company News: Taking a provincial telecom into the world market / A look at Bell Canada's strategy for expanding beyond providing local telephone services Mr Jean Monty, Bell Canada's chairman, is determined to prove that a medium-sized telephone company can expand and prosper among the giants of the international telecommunications industry. What it takes, he says, is a careful assessment of strengths and weaknesses. Bell is Canada's biggest telephone company, with revenues exceeding CDollars 7bn (USDollars 5.8bn) year, profits of almost a CDollars 1bn in 1991 and over 54,000 employees. Its parent, BCE, also owns 53 per cent of Northern Telecom, the telephone equipment supplier. Bell-Northern Research, jointly owned by Bell and Northern Telecom, is Canada's biggest privately-owned R&amp;D establishment. Mr Monty recognises that Bell has its limitations in trying to compete with such behemoths at AT&amp;T, British Telecom and NTT. 'You can't go after an elephant by punching him on the nose,' he says. Although Bell's basic telephone business remains confined to the provinces of Ontario and Quebec, it has recently moved to deepen and broaden its business. A consortium led by Bell last month bought the Canadian government's controlling interest in Telesat Canada, which owns and operates the country's commercial satellite network. A reorganisation of Telecom Canada, the domestic long-distance monopoly owned by the nine provincial phone companies, has left Bell as the most powerful shareholder. Telecom Canada has been renamed Stentor. A senior Bell executive has taken over as president of Stentor Resource Centre, a subsidiary in which the shareholders will pool their national marketing and engineering resources. BCE, clearly acting as Bell's stalking horse, has acquired a 60 per cent stake and forged a close working partnership with SHL Systemhouse, a data-systems integrator with interests in Canada, the US and Britain. Bell is also trying to find a way of getting more leverage out of the 22 per cent stake which BCE has in Teleglobe Canada, the company which provides all Canada's overseas telephone services. A common thread through all these moves is Bell's effort to gain a springboard into the US, from where much of the competition in the Canadian telephone market originates. Mr Monty says Bell plans to step up pressure on Teleglobe to bring down its overseas rates to attract international traffic from US businesses. The alternative, he warns, is for Bell to do a deal with a US company which would bypass Teleglobe. Two of Telesat Canada's satellites have a 'footprint' which extends almost to the Mexican border. 'There will be 'open skies' in the satellite business in North America,' Mr Monty says. Mr Frank Koelsch, a Toronto telecommunications consultant, concludes: 'Bell is trying to put together a very powerful organisation while they still have the strength to do it.' A government proposal to limit foreign ownership of any telecommunications common carrier to 20 per cent will also benefit Bell. Much of Bell's most profitable business is threatened by intensifying competition. While the provincial telephone companies continue to be closely regulated by the government, the market for those who 'resell' or share phone services has become a virtual free-for-all. The bulk of the business previously reserved for Canadian utilities is going to the US. With the help of cut-price resellers, for instance, many Canadian businesses now route their long-distance calls through the US. Some have even moved their data centres south of the border. The resellers, who buy phone connections at wholesale prices from the telephone companies and then 'resell' to big users, have gained a 6 per cent share of Canadian long-distance traffic in the past two years. Bell expects their share to climb to over 10 per cent by 1994. Britain's Cable &amp; Wireless has been among the most successful in penetrating the reseller market in Canada. Bell is also facing a domestic challenge. Within the next few weeks, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission is expected to open the door for the first time to competition in domestic long-distance service. Unitel Communications, a joint venture between Canadian Pacific, the transport conglomerate, and Rogers Communications, the country's biggest cable-TV operator, has been fighting for almost a decade to break the long-distance monopoly held by Telecom Canada. The problem for Bell and the other provincial phone companies is that, although they have halved long-distance charges in the past four years, these calls still provide a huge subsidy to cheap local services. All local calls in Canada are free. Although any change would be political dynamite, Mr Monty is hoping that regulators will allow the phone companies to start charging for ultra-heavy users, such as the tele-marketing companies which use computerised dialling machines. Bell has also argued that if Unitel is allowed to compete for lucrative long-distance traffic, it should make a contribution towards the cost of maintaining free local calls. Bell has threatened to cut its investment in local services if Unitel is given an unfair advantage in the long-distance market. The bottom line for Bell and the other provincial utilities, however, is that they must move fast to bring down costs and improve services. Bell recently accelerated the conversion of its local network to digital equipment. The work is now due for completion by 1994, three years earlier than planned. A digital network allows the phone companies to offer lucrative value-added features to subsidise the cheap basic service. Among the newest features is one which allows a household telephone to be used as an answering machine. Bell can also programme one telephone to ring in several different tones, depending on which member of a family is being called.</p>

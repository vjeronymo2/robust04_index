He had to notice this  again and again in his talks with high-ranking U.S. politicians,  Scharping said at the conclusion of his one-week visit to the  United States in New York on the weekend [16-17 April].  Schaeuble had been in the United States for a similar public  relations trip 14 days before Scharping. "Anyone who slanders a  domestic policy opponent abroad acts irresponsibly" and damages  Germany's reputation, the SPD chief said. The fear of a change  in government is "no justification for purposefully launching  misinterpretations about political opponents."    Scharping told SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG that his interlocutors  in  the U.S. Administration and in Congress repeatedly asked him  about the SPD's attitude toward NATO. When he explained, the  Americans were often surprised and said that just recently  Schaeuble had told them something completely different. The  CDU/CSU Bundestag group chairman also claimed in the United  States that the Free Democratic Party of Germany will in any  case be at the side of the CDU/CSU in the Bundestag election  campaign and afterward. Therefore, the SPD is only left with an  alliance with the Greens, who have the dissolution of NATO and  the abolition of the Bundeswehr in their program.    In an interview with U.S. journalists, Schaeuble had deduced  from these ideas: "As an American I would decide in favor of  our coalition, because it is more reliable." In addition,  Schaeuble stressed "profound differences" in foreign policy  between the Federal Government and the SPD, even though  Scharping gives assurances of the opposite. Schaeuble added:  "I am not sure whether Scharping might not actually share our  position, but he cannot push it through in his party."</p>

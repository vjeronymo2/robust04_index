Kim told the Labor Ministry to do its best to make this year  the first year of labor-management cooperation" and make efforts  to keep the peace in industrial relations and encourage low wage  demands.    "Pay raises reached 12 percent in stagnation last year. This  pace of increase will weaken the competitiveness of industry,"  Kim said.    The ministry should see to it that unions obey the law when  they exercise their rights and encourage district labor  administration offices to do their best to prevent industrial  disputes, Kim said.    It should also study the welfare of workers, including the  expansion of stock-sharing for employees and of housing for  workers, he said.    Preventing industrial accidents is important because of  respect for human life and stabilization of occupation, he said.    "Enterprisers should have the mind that they are putting  their own children to work," the president said.    In a separate briefing session later in the day, Kim  instructed the Communications Ministry to make creation of a  super high speed information network, the communications system  of the future, its top priority project in 1994.    "Carry out the matters of primary concern, including selling  stocks of communications businesses and selection of the  business that will take the second cellular phone project justly  and without any suspicion," he ordered.    He instructed the ministry to internationalize the  communications industry and privatise communications companies  to introduce competition in the field, most of which is  currently state- controlled.</p>

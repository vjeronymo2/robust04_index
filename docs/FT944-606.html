			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Arts: Gifts for the glitterati - Our critics present their seasonal greetings to leading figures in the arts world As it was not exported to the Getty Museum after all, I shall give Canova's 'The Three Graces' to Jeremy Isaacs at the Royal Opera House. It will look splendid at the top of the grand staircase that is planned for his new building and should impress the chairman of the Arts Council when he drops into the general director's office in the meantime. How appropriate, too, that the figures seem to have acquired new identities: Patience, Thrift and Ingenuity. Patience, because the signs are that public opinion is against the Royal Opera House getting lottery money to fund its ambitious Pounds 100m redevelopment plan. Thrift, in order to reduce the company's financial deficit. And Ingenuity, to continue putting on a world-class programme in the face of competition from massively-subsidised opera-houses overseas. If Mr Isaacs does not like my gift, he could always try selling it on the black market. The Pounds 7m plus that it would raise could solve his problems for years to come. Alternatively, he could swop the three buxom ladies for The Three Tenors in concert. But then again - considering their fee for that Los Angeles gig - perhaps not. ***** For Peter Sellars, a desert island, on which he could stage The Oresteia, with Bill T. Jones as Clytemnestra, Steven Berkoff as Electra and Agamemnon, with William Forsythe on hand to choreograph the tap dances and Andrew Lloyd Webber providing revised versions (tango, rock, waltz, etc.) of choral odes at each performance, for an audience of surrounding sharks. For John Barton at the RSC, a new production of Shakespeare's Richard II-Henry IV-Henry V tetralogy at the Swan, with Mark Rylance as both Richard II and Henry V, and Michael Gambon as Falstaff. For Galina Gorchakova (a) a tuning fork (b) a house in London (c) a season at Covent Garden singing in La Forza del destino, The Queen of Spades, and Don Carlo, among others. For Judi Dench, a revival of the Peter Hall Antony and Cleopatra (the production also to be recorded on TV) and a new production of Beckett's Happy Days at the Cottesloe. For Harold Pinter and Tom Stoppard, two or more new plays each. For Darcey Bussell, an injury-free season with intense coaching by Suzanne Farrell in the Balanchine repertory; plus a revival of Ashton's three-act Sylvia. For Nicholas Hytner, new productions of Cos fan tutte, Il Trovatore, Lope de Vega's The Great Pretenders, and a new play by Alan Bennett, with whichever British companies he chose. For Harriet Walter, an RSC season as Millamant, Hedda Gabler, Beatrice, and Rosalind. For Mark Morris, an Edinburgh Festival production of any Rameau opera, a new staging of Handel's Terpsicore and a new work to commissioned music by Michelle Shocked and Rob Wasserman. For Stephen Daldry and Anthony Dowell, a fire in the scenery department. For Anderson Country (Radio 4), a fire in the sound department. For Bryn Terfel, every pre-20th-century Italian and French and Russian role and every 20th-century British role he is ready for and has time to sing. ***** Santa, that great deceiver, will probably let me down (again) but, if he received that note I posted to him at the North Pole, he will make the following deliveries: To Jeremy Isaacs and the Royal Opera House, a large bundle of National Lottery cash (which I trust will not prove to be Fool's Gold) so that prices can be reduced. Those one-time 'regular' audiences at Covent Garden have been priced out of their seats. Gone are the days when people could afford to go to opera and ballet three or more times a week. A opera house is vastly the poorer without the enthusiasms of these devotees, who give the theatre a vital part of its atmosphere and spirit. To Anthony Dowell and Derek Deane, as directors of two big classical companies: a brace (each) of real thousand-watt, rampagious ballerinas. Difficult, maybe, but certainly divine, these stars make sense of the old repertory that the Royal and English National Ballets offer us. At the moment we see nice, dutiful young ladies busy being Princesses, Swan Queens and betrayed peasants. The heroine, alas, is not at home. It needs temperament and a grand style to justify such ballets. And, as a bonus, the box-office is swamped. To Sadler's Wells Theatre: policies which will brings a brighter and more vital air to the theatre. How welcome would be an end to visits from awful and awfully optimistic dance troupes. Let there be coffee rather than dish-water in the pit cafe; a general sprucing of the theatre's facilities; an end to mindless pop music in the De Valois room; a foyer less like the rush-hour on the Northern Line (move the bar]). And to London - a city where dance was once vital - the much-needed Dance House, to be a home for English National Ballet and Rambert Dance, an added stage for the Royal Ballet, and a serious port of call for large visiting troupes.</p>

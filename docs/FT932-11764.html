			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Disappointing outlook for jobs in Japan THE Japanese labour market is as weak as it was during the mid-1980s recession, according to official employment figures published yesterday. They suggest that any recovery in Japanese consumer spending this year will be modest. The average monthly wage in the year to the end of March rose by 1.4 per cent, the lowest growth since 1970, according to the Labour Ministry. Real wages did not grow at all, the ministry said. Fixed wages rose by 3.4 per cent a month, to Y266,915 (Pounds 1,570) while non-fixed payments such as overtime fell by 10.8 per cent to Y23,336. Employment rose by less than 0.1 per cent in March compared with a year before, after a 0.4 per cent decline in February. The job offers to job applicants ratio fell to 0.88. That means there are just 88 job offers for every 100 people officially seeking work. Mr Geoffrey Barker, economist at Baring Securities said: 'This is the weakest level of labour demand since the strong yen crisis of 1985 to 1986.' Female employment fell by 0.7 per cent in March, while male employment rose by 0.5 per cent. Many women workers who leave work do not register for official unemployment benefits. Partly as a result the Japanese unemployment rate was unchanged last month at 2.3 per cent. The weakening of the labour market, combined with the recent strengthening of the yen against the dollar, is likely to further depress Japanese inflation. Inflation in Tokyo, which is a leading indicator of national trends, rose by only 0.1 percentage points last month, an annual rate of 1.3 per cent. Import prices fell for 19 of 40 products surveyed by the Economic Planning Agency in April, up from 10 in March.</p>

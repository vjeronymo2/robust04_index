			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Property: New clothes for a ragged sector - Italy's market is being radically refashioned For decades the Italian property market, like the wider economy, has been heavily influenced by partitocrazia (party allegiance and corruption). Unauthorised constructions have been common; developments have been undertaken without any provision for appropriate infrastructure; and little regard has been paid to satisfying the real demands of potential buyers. But things are now changing. In the clamour for change unleashed by the widespread exposure of bribery in government and business, the property sector is poised for an overhaul. According to Nomisma, a research group based in Bologna, the market will undergo fundamental changes over the next few years. These include: improvements in valuation methods, record-keeping and accountability; and the development of more sophisticated vehicles through which property can be acquired and held. Already this year, Italy has adopted the second EC directive on the 'co-ordination of banks' which will end the division between ordinary banks and special credit institutes. Until now the former have been restricted to short- or medium-term lending while the latter have been confined to making long-term loans. The blurring of the distinction between ordinary banks and special credit institutes is expected to encourage the development of new financial products, making property investment easier. New legislation expected to be enacted in 1993-94 will also allow the creation of property funds and new pension funds. In addition, the government has proposed a spending programme of L10,000bn between 1993-95 on infrastructure improvements designed to create jobs. Also, Italy's leading railway company, recently privatised, is funding the regeneration of old railway land in cities such as Rome and Milan. Combined, these measures are likely to boost private-sector property investment and provide an impetus for upgrading - and enforcing - professional standards, particularly in methods of conducting and recording property valuations. Unlike the markets of its European neighbours, bank lending to property in Italy is relatively low, a critical factor, say observers, in the Italian sector's relative resilience in recent months. In Britain, by contrast, banks have been badly exposed by their lending to property, which reached unprecedented levels in the late 1980s. According to Nomisma, the Italian sector - unlike other European markets - has emerged relatively unscathed from the worldwide recession. In the past six months the value of office property in Italy has declined by slightly less than half a percentage point, while the value of the retail sector has fallen by 2.2 per cent. Rents for offices have fallen by 6.2 per cent and by 7 per cent for retail properties over the same period; the value of residential property increased by 1.2 per cent and residential rents by 5.5 per cent. The property market attracted some L152,000bn last year, of which half was invested in the residential sector. A further 20 per cent of the total went into infrastructure improvements and the balance was split between retail, office and industrial property. This is in contrast to the British market, where commercial property is the main recipient of investment. At present most commercial office stock is owner-occupied; even small professional partnerships tend to own premises in town centres. The attractions of commercial property as an active investment medium are still unexploited, so this sector holds out many opportunities. Insurance companies and banks are also leading investors, but again much of their stock is retained for operational purposes; even banks' residential premises are set aside for employees. Pension funds are also significant property investors but no data on volume is available. The latest figures from Italy's central bank suggest that insurance companies' property holdings total L20,000bn, of which commercial property (mainly offices) accounts for about 40 per cent and residential 50 per cent. Banks' property holdings total L18,400bn, with offices accounting for 80 per cent of the total, most of which are owner-occupied and situated in historic town centres. Many of these town centres have become saturated, though this has yet to encourage significant out-of-town developments. The bias towards residential property in investment activity is largely due to two factors. First, insurance companies have been obliged by law to invest 4 per cent of their reserves in residential property with protected rents; second, banks have tended to acquire accommodation to house their staff enabling them to relocate on demand. Rent control legislation was lifted last year and while the effects will take some time to feed through into the market, Nomisma expects this measure to cause substantial rental growth in the medium term. New legislation has also restricted security of tenure, giving many landlords an automatic right to break a lease after eight years. Besides the effects of partitocrazia, the main impediment to a smooth working of the market has been bureaucracy. One big problem for property companies has been to determine who in government makes decisions and on what basis. Property companies have particularly been subject to the unofficial practices that mushroomed with the growth of partitocrazia. Today it is still difficult to collect information on property ownership. There is little reliable data; what data does exist has not been made publicly available by government, local authorities or companies. Under Italian accounting practices, companies are not required to record current property values in balance sheets; valuations which are quoted in balance sheets are not carried out according to any recognised national standard or on a regular basis and therefore provide little indication of real current market values. The legacy of partitocrazia has been a weak economy, with a public debt representing 106 per cent of gross domestic product in 1992. Unemployment is 10.5 per cent and rising. Privatisation is high on the government's agenda, though it has been hit by internal bickering over the best methods of divestiture. The crackdown on partitocrazia - evidenced by the spate of bribery charges against politicians and businessmen - allied with a tougher regulatory structure - is likely to lead to a more transparent business environment; this will be reflected in changes in the property market. For potential investors, an improving economy, with increased government spending on infrastructure, a market with inherent supply constraints (such as historic town centres where expansion is physically not possible) and financial innovation add up to the right combination of ingredients to refashion Italy's property industry.

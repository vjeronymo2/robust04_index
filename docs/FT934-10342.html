			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / International Company News: Calls to China boost Hong Kong Telecom HONGKONG Telecommunications, the colony's monopoly telephone utility which is 57.5 per cent owned by the UK's Cable &amp; Wireless, yesterday posted a 15 per cent rise in interim net profit to HKDollars 3.65bn (USDollars 472.8m) due to continuing strong growth in calls to China. Profits were up from HKDollars 3.17bn in the six months to September 1992, while turnover increased by 13 per cent to HKDollars 11.95bn, with revenue from international telephone services growing by a similar proportion to HKDollars 7.53bn. The interim dividend is 23.4 cents a share, up from 20.3 cents in 1992. Mr Michael Gale, Hongkong Telecom's chief executive, said he believed the rate of earnings growth could be maintained for the full year. Calls to China rose by 48 per cent in the first half of the year, accounting for 30 per cent of international phone revenues. The company is emphasising its strategy of diversifying its income stream away from international telephony. It loses its international monopoly in 2006, while its monopoly on its domestic network will be removed in 1995. Hongkong Telecom completed the digitalisation of its telephone network in July, and plans to capitalise on this by focusing on the development of interactive multimedia services, thereby keeping the company a step ahead of competition. This week Hongkong Telecom said it had applied for a licence to operate a cable TV network after mid-1996. It is already investigating the potential for a video-on-demand service, which could be carried via the existing telecommunications network.</p>

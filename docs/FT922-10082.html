			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Lloyds branches may be hit worst in Midland takeover LLOYDS BANK may close more of its own branches than those of Midland if it succeeds in buying its UK rival, Mr Brian Pearse, Midland's chief executive, claimed yesterday. As Midland fired its first serious shots in its battle to ward off Lloyds' takeover proposals, Mr Pearse said he expected Lloyds would have difficulty in maintaining the morale of its staff during the takeover struggle. Midland wrote to its shareholders to say it prefers the Pounds 3.3bn bid made by Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. Mr Pearse said that when Lloyds and Midland were having secret takeover talks between December last year and mid-March, 'we were told that more Lloyds branches would be closed than ours'. Lloyds was then discussing the closure of 1,100 of the banks' combined 3,745 branches. However, when Lloyds announced on Tuesday that it wanted to pay Pounds 3.6bn to buy Midland, it said the takeover would involve the closure of 1,000 branches. Lloyds said yesterday no decision had been made on whether more Midland or Lloyds branches would be closed. Meanwhile, Bifu, the UK banking union, threatened disruptive industrial action as a last resort to protect jobs. Mr Leif Mills, the union's general secretary, said: 'It is a possibility that various forms of action might take place, if all else fails.' The union will not take action while it is continuing its campaign to have a Lloyds bid for Midland blocked by the competition authorities. Bifu now believes that 30,000 jobs would go if the takeover goes ahead, rather than the 20,000 Lloyds' estimate. Mr Pearse, meanwhile, rejected suggestions that Midland turned down Lloyds' initial takeover approach because directors wanted to protect their own jobs. 'Under Lloyds' original proposals, we would have filled most of the top jobs', he said. Lloyds had planned, he said, that Sir Peter Walters, Midland's chairman, should become chairman of the combined banks. Mr Pearse would have been deputy chief executive. Mr Richard Delbridge, Midland's finance director, would have been the combined banks' chief executive. Lloyds said it was putting the finishing touches to the submission it will make to the Office of Fair Trading on why Hongkong Bank's bid should be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, if its own bid is referred there.

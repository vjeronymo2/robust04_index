			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Rivals challenge GE's aero-engine tests Rolls-Royce and Pratt &amp; Whitney are challenging proposals by General Electric of the US to change part of the testing procedure for large civil aircraft engines to power the new generation of Boeing 777 aircraft. The dispute, which has come before the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), is likely to have significant implications for the fierce competition between the big three aero-engine makers to supply heavy-thrust engines to power Boeing's new 777 and future jumbo jets. The controversy centres on GE's proposal to use an alternative test procedure for one of the elements in the airworthiness certification for jet engines, the 'blade-out' test. Under the traditional procedure, a blade is released at its root or dovetail while the engine is running. To pass the test, the blade and other broken fragments must be confined by the engine's containment ring. GE proposes to separate the blade not at its dovetail but some distance above the root area. The US company, which has developed a composite fan blade for the GE90, argues a composite blade root failure is improbable. Rolls-Royce and Pratt &amp; Whitney have already completed the tests for their respective Trent 800 and PW4048 engines under the traditional procedure. GE's rivals are understood to be pressing for no change in the regulations since they consider this would give GE an unfair competitive advantage. They also suggest that the risk of a composite fan blade failure at the dovetail may be higher than predicted. GE is the only one of the big three engine makers opting for a composite fan blade for its heavy thrust engine. Rolls-Royce and Pratt &amp; Whitney are using wide-chord, hollow titanium blades for their new big engines. However, should the FAA reject the GE alternative proposal, industry experts said this could delay GE's certification programme and possibly mean the company will not be able to deliver its first GE90s to BA on time. The FAA, which has been analysing the GE proposal for the past few months, is now expected to reach a decision soon following the submission of responses it solicited from GE's competitors.</p>

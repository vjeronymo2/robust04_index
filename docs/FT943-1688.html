			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / 'Hidden jobless' in Ukraine Ukraine has more hidden jobless than any other country in central and eastern Europe and open unemployment is likely to soar next year as economic reforms gather pace, according to a survey by the International Labour Organisation. Mr Guy Standing, head of the ILO's east European team, said yesterday the true unemployment rate in Ukraine was already in double figures, compared with an official rate of less than 1 per cent. In addition, some 12 per cent of workers are on long-term unpaid leave. The survey, covering 348 manufacturing enterprises employing over 372,000 workers, contradicts suggestions that Ukrainian factories are clinging to workers regardless of collapsing output. The survey shows widespread job-shedding over the past year, especially in state-owned factories, as well as extensive short-time working and resort to unpaid leave. With enterprises still holding more workers than they need, Mr Standing predicts a 'massive' increase in unemployment next year as industrial restructuring accelerates. Over a quarter of factory managements in the survey expected their firms to go bankrupt within a year.</p>

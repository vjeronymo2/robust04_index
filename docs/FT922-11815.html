			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Teachers call for set levels of staffing A NATIONAL regime for funding and staffing state schools in England and Wales was demanded yesterday by the NASUWT, the second-largest teachers' union. If implemented, the reform would in effect entail abolition of the financial role of local education authorities in England and Wales. It also would curb the powers being conferred on head teachers and governing bodies through the local management of schools. NASUWT leaders told the union's annual conference yesterday that the change was an inevitable consequence of government policies on the opting out of schools and on capping of local authority spending. Declaring the general election 'a watershed in the administration and organisation of the state education service', delegates carried a motion calling for 'all schools to be staffed on an agreed national model'. Funding of teachers' salaries would then be 'a direct charge on the Exchequer', with terms and conditions settled by the profession's independent review body in conjunction with a new national forum representing employers, unions and the government. Mr Nigel de Gruchy, NASUWT general secretary, said: 'This is a challenge to the government to take their own national curriculum and pupil-testing seriously. 'At the moment we have the nonsensical situation that teachers are being made redundant because their pay award is not properly funded by some local authorities whose spending is capped by the government.' The conference, meeting in Scarborough, also urged the establishment of 'a collegiate and collaborative' structure in schools, with an end to the existing differentiated salary structure and performance pay for individuals. At a press conference later, Mr de Gruchy condemned moves by opted-out schools not to recognise teachers' unions. He said the refusal of Wilson's School in Sutton, south-west London, to negotiate with NASUWT representatives over proposed redundancies would be 'vigorously resisted' and could lead to a strike. Grant-maintained schools are not obliged by law to recognise unions, and they are not bound to follow the recommendations of the teachers' pay review body. However, Mr de Gruchy urged staff in grant-maintained schools to press for them to do so, even if pay increases larger than the national award were on offer. Mr de Gruchy said: 'This is the not-too-hidden agenda of the Tory right  - breaking the teacher unions.' Editorial comment, Page 22</p>

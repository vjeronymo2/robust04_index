At the press  conference were actor Morgan Fairchild, company mascot Charlie the Tuna and  environmentalists from Earth Island Institute, Greenpeace, the American Oceans  Campaign, the American Humane Assn. and the Earth Communications Office.  StarKist, the first canner to decide not to buy tuna caught in ways that  endanger dolphins, donated the 100 cases to the Los Angeles Mission.  </P></p>

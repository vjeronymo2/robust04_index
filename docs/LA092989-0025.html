			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: PEOPLE  </P> <P> ABC briefly considered putting its "Chicken Soup" star Jackie Mason on its  "PrimeTime Live" news program Thursday night to discuss his controversial  comments regarding the mayoral race in New York, but ultimately rejected the  idea, network officials said. Mason, whose comedy centers on Jewish themes, was  roundly criticized by Jewish organizations and other groups after he was quoted  in the Village Voice saying that mayoral candidate David N. Dinkins "looks like  a black model without a job" and suggested that Jews vote for blacks out of  guilt. ABC officials had no comment about Mason's remarks or about how it may  affect his new sitcom. "Chicken Soup" executive producer Saul Turteltaub said  he had no idea whether the comments would hurt the show, saying, "It's up to  the viewers." DANIEL CERONE  </P></p>

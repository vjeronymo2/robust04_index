			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / International Company News: Public spotlight about to fall on a rare player in global business - Profile of a woman who through her career has developed a reputation for financial innovation Some time over the next year the World Bank will launch its first D-Mark-denominated global bond. And the bank's new treasurer, who played a key role in the development of the global bond programme, will enjoy a brief moment in the public spotlight. The attention accorded to Ms Jessica Einhorn will undoubtedly focus on the fact that, as a woman, she is a rarity in the upper echelons of international finance. Yet her experience, and a record of innovation in the capital markets, rather than her gender has helped Ms Einhorn achieve her current status of treasurer and vice-president of the World Bank. The appointment of Ms Einhorn, 45, a veteran of the US Treasury and the State Department, was announced six months ago. She had ample time to prepare for the job of treasurer, working since 1981 for her predecessors Mr Don Roth, the former Merrill Lynch executive, and Mr Eugene Rotberg, who became something of an institution in the Euromarkets during 19 years in charge of the bank's finances. Mr Rotberg has high praise for Ms Einhorn: 'There are very few people in the world who understand the intricacies of international finance and fewer still who also have experience in public policy. She has considerable skills in both fields.' It was thus no surprise when Mr Lewis Preston, World Bank president, gave Ms Einhorn the job of directing a staff of 250 people, raising about Dollars 17bn a year, managing Dollars 20bn of liquidity and looking after total outstanding debts of Dollars 97bn. 'Jessica set up the World Bank's entire currency swap programme in the early 1980s, and she was part of the team that invented the global bond in 1989, and she used sophisticated hedging techniques to restructure the bank's financial policies,' says Mr Rotberg, adding: 'She knows everybody.' Her mentors have included Mr Paul Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve, and Mr Jack Hennessy, former assistant secretary of the Treasury and now chief executive of First Boston, the Wall Street investment house. Mr Hennessy says he first hired Ms Einhorn 20 years ago when she came to interview him at the Treasury. After working for Mr Hennessy and for Mr Volcker at the Treasury, she went on to become special assistant to the under-secretary of state for economic affairs, specialising in international monetary affairs. Between 1977 and March 1981, when she joined the World Bank treasury, Ms Einhorn studied bank lending to developing countries at the Brookings Institute, spent a year on the financial policy side of the World Bank and 15 months back at the State Department as a senior official in the International Development Co-operation Agency. It was, however, in the early 1980s that Ms Einhorn first placed her imprimatur on the World Bank's finances. Although Mr Rotberg was the treasurer, she led the team that restructured the bank's borrowing programme to meet the demands of rapidly changing world financial markets. Against the background of volatile, and historically high, world interest rates, Ms Einhorn shepherded the bank through a series of changes in its borrowing policy, including a move from fixed-rate to variable-rate borrowing, greater use of the short-term debt markets, and the pioneering of currency swaps. By shifting to variable-rate financing, the bank wanted to avoid locking in high long-term rates on its debt and ensure its loans were funded with matched liabilities as part of its increasingly flexible borrowing programme. At the same time, she helped the bank to expand its activities in short-term debt markets - most notably through its discount notes, a form of commercial paper with maturities of up to a year. In 1982, Ms Einhorn helped engineer what is believed to be the world's first currency swap, when the World Bank swapped dollars in return for Swiss Francs with US computer giant IBM. The use of swaps developed rapidly, allowing the bank to raise funds in currencies that did not match their core liabilities, and providing access to new markets. Not all of Ms Einhorn's new borrowing tools were a success. In 1984, for example, the bank introduced the 'T-bill based floater'. This was medium-term paper priced in relation to the yield on the US Treasury bill rather than the usual Libor (London Interbank Offered Rate). However, it never took off because investors mostly wanted Libor-indexed debt. The most successful innovation during Ms Einhorn's tenure managing the bank's borrowings was probably the global bond, introduced in 1989. It is a large (more than Dollars 1bn) international debt security which the bank places simultaneously in major financial centres around the world. Thanks to special trading and multiple clearing arrangements, the bonds can be bought or sold across all world markets at relatively narrow spreads. Seven global dollar or yen bond issues have so far been launched, and this year a D-Mark issue will be launched. The great advantage of global bonds for the bank is that they widen the pool of available investors and allow the bank to consolidate its underwritten borrowings into a small number of large transactions. Given her role in the birth of the product, it is fitting that the first D-Mark global bond will be sold under Ms Einhorn's stewardship. Today, however, she has less time for the pioneering work she enjoyed during the 1980s: 'When I was the young staff person my job was to help innovate, but now my task is to make sure these innovations meet all the other standards for our balance sheet.'</p>

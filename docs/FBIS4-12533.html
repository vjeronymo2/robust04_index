			<p>BFN     [Text] In occupied Kashmir, Indian troops continued their  repressive measures killing and wounding a number of people in  ruthless military crack down in Srinagar, Baramula, Kupwara, and  Pulwama. Several innocent civilians were also arrested. In  all, 10 people were killed in random firing by Indian soldiers  who also killed six people in indiscriminate firing in Srinagar.  Mojahedin in retaliatory attacks killed nine soldiers. They  carried out rocket attack on a battalion headquarters at  (Manjakot) in Rajouri area killing six Indian soldiers. The  building of the Battalion headquarters was badly damaged.  Mojahedin killed another two soldiers when they opened fire on  rampaging troops during siege and search operations in Pulwama.    The leader of the All Parties Hurriyat [Freedom] Conference  in occupied Kashmir has described the last session of the UN  Human Rights Commission in Geneva as a great victory for the  Kashmiri people as Pakistan was able to internationalize the  Kashmir issue. The Kashmiri leaders, who had come to the Indian  capital to apprise the U.S. deputy secretary of state and  members of his delegation about the ground realities in occupied  Kashmir, rejected India's claim that the deferment of the  resolution on Kashmir at the human rights conference in Geneva  was a severe jolt to the Kashmiri movement. In an interview,  the Hurriyat leaders Professor Abdul Ghani, Justice retired  Mufti Bahuddin Farooqi, Mr. G.M. Bhatt, Maulavi Abbas Ansari,  and Mr. G.N. Shahin said top priority for the Kashmiri people is  to get rid of the yoke of Indian slavery. They praised Pakistan  for internationalizing the Kashmir problem, saying it was a  great achievement as Kashmiri people could not do so in Geneva  without Pakistan. The Hurriyat leaders praised Ms. Benazir  Bhutto's government for its stand on Kashmir and hoped Pakistan  would continue its diplomatic, political, and moral support to  the Kashmiri people.</p>

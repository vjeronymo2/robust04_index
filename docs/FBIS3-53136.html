			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mahmud Bakri] </F>   [Text] The Clinton administration has prepared a plan to  overthrow Libyan revolution leader Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi  before the middle of this year. Washington began contacts with  European countries and rebels in south Sudan to implement a  scheme to separate south Sudan from north Sudan and create an  African state to protect U.S. and European interests in the Horn  of Africa.    President Bill Clinton asked the National Security Council  to  prepare a new plan to overthrow Libyan leader Mu'ammar  al-Qadhdhafi's regime to replace the plan that the CIA failed to  implement last year. Sources reported that the new plan, which  the U.S. National Security Council wants to implement before the  middle of this year, focuses on the following factors:    1. Gathering the Libyan opposition forces in various parts  of the world and agreeing with them on the "Salvation and Purge"  plan as they call it.    2. Tasking U.S. ambassadors in various countries to meet  Libyan opposition forces and discuss their requests for  necessary funds and arms to implement the plan.    3. Asking particular Libyan opposition figures to hold  contacts inside Libya with particular Libyan military commands  qualified to participate in implementing the plan.    4. Agreeing with a country neighboring Libya to act as the  assembly and staging point to carry out the plan.    5. Contacting particular European governments and agencies  to participate in military and financial funding to implement  the plan.    Sources asserted that a U.S. National Security Council team  will meet figures who call themselves Libyan opposition leaders  in Washington in the next few weeks. These figures have  received invitations to visit Washington for this purpose.    A meeting was held in Washington with Sudanese rebels from  south Sudan to prepare a plan. Washington bases its new plan  against fraternal Sudan on the "Washington declaration" of last  October. The U.S. Administration, which approves the secession  of south Sudan, arranged this declaration for particular south  Sudanese rebels. The new U.S. plan aims to incite the south  Sudanese people to broaden their political and economic demands  if the Sudanese Government insists on continuing the  negotiations to solve the problem of south Sudan. The  southerners will then escalate military operations in a bid to  avoid Arab and African opposition to the establishment of a  state in south Sudan and to convince African and Arab countries  that a state in the south was established after negotiations  with the Sudanese Government failed. The sources pointed out  that Washington expressed a readiness for military intervention  in favor of the southerners to implement the U.S. plan.</p>

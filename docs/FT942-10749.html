			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / International Company News: Birla ready for multinational challenge - India's family-run conglomerate has no fear of competition Few leaders of Indian industry are as enthusiastic about their commercial future as Mr Aditya Birla. At a recent business conference in New Delhi, he gave such a rousing summary of India's economic prospects that he won more applause than even the charismatic reform-minded finance minister, Mr Manmohan Singh. Mr Birla has good reason to feel more optimistic than most. As head of a grouping with annual sales of over Rs100bn (Dollars 3.2bn), he controls one of the largest industrial houses in India, with interests in textiles, chemicals, metals and cement. Moreover, unlike most other big family-run groups, Mr Birla's companies already have a substantial investment overseas - over half of total sales come from plants in south-east Asia, Africa and elsewhere. Birla companies made their first foreign investment - a textile mill in Ethiopia - 35 years ago. Mr Birla says that having competed with foreign companies abroad he has no fears about meeting the challenge of the multinationals in India, his native land. 'We have been operating abroad in free markets for many years. I would say competitors should be afraid of me.' Some other businessmen have expressed fears that Indian industry might be swamped by foreign companies, and have urged the government to protect them from the onslaught. Mr Birla says he understands these concerns. Local groups producing branded goods have genuine difficulties because multinationals have 'built their brands over a 100 years in 100 countries spending millions of dollars'. These advantages cannot be wished away. But Mr Birla says that in basic industries - including the activities of Birla group companies - success is mainly determined not by brand but by quality and cost-competitiveness. 'In the sectors we are in, we can hold our own.' Unlike the small-scale obsolete plants typical of much of Indian industry, Mr Birla's enterprises compare well with the world's largest. He says his companies are sixth biggest in the world in carbon black, third in electrical insulators, first in refined palm oil and in rayon fibre. Mr Birla's companies produce rayon in Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines as well as India. His aluminium smelter in north India, producing over 140,000 tonnes of metal a year, is among the world's top 15 per cent lowest-cost producers. The Birla fortunes date back to the 19th century, when the family moved from its ancestral home in Rajasthan to Calcutta, the commercial centre of British India. Members of the Marwari merchant caste, they quickly made money trading jute and opium and established themselves in jute production. The family prospered under the legendary leadership of Mr G. K. Birla, Mr Aditya Birla's grandfather, who dominated the business for more than 60 years until his death in 1983. Control of Birla companies is spread among about six family branches, but Mr Aditya Birla was singled out for special favour by his grandfather because of his precocious business talents and he was bequeathed the best of the group. Mr Aditya Birla particularly impressed his grandfather by expanding overseas in the 1960s and 1970s, when the socialist-inspired governments in New Delhi tried to curb the domestic expansion of large groups. Mr Aditya Birla's main listed companies, in which the family holds 20 to 30 per cent of the equity, are Grasim Industries (cement, textiles, and caustic soda), Hindalco Industries (aluminium), Indian Rayon and Industries (rayon, carbon black) and Indo Gulf Fertilisers and Chemicals (urea-based fertilisers). The group is in the midst of important investment plans, put together before Mr P. V. Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, launched economic reform in 1991 but which have since been brought forward and expanded. Altogether, Mr Birla's companies are spending Rs70bn over the next three years. Hindalco, which is spending Rs12.5bn, is expanding output of refined aluminium by 40,000 tonnes a year to 210,000 tonnes and installing a new rolling mill. Grasim is spending Rs14.5bn on expanding production of cement (it is India's largest manufacturer) and rayon and on a recently-completed sponge iron plant in the western state of Maharashtra. Indian Rayon, Indo-gulf Fertilisers and smaller companies also plan expansion and new ventures ranging from software exports to producing magnesia from sea water. However, even these projects are dwarfed by Mr Birla's plan to build a Rs27.5bn oil refinery with an annual capacity of 3m tonnes of crude in Mangalore, on the south-west coast. Formed as a joint venture with Hindustan Petroleum, a state-owned oil company, the plant is expected to come on stream in 1996. To help fund these schemes, Birla group companies have raised some Dollars 423m through Euro-equity issues in the past 18 months and intend to raise a further Dollars 200m. Mr Birla rejects suggestions that the group is becoming too diverse. He runs his empire by delegating decision-making to the operating companies, while remaining in overall charge of the direction the businesses take. He keeps in touch with financial performance by a regular reporting of cash positions - using a system developed by the Marwari caste. Mr Birla is now so confident of India's future that his overseas companies are putting capital into the Indian operation - reversing the flow of previous years. His main immediate concern about the Indian economy is inflation, which has risen sharply in the past year from below 7 per cent to over 10 per cent for wholesale prices. Mr Birla says: 'We have to ensure that our costs don't go up with inflation if we are to remain competitive.'</p>

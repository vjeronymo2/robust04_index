			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Hounslow to cut 250 jobs HOUNSLOW, the Labour-controlled London borough, is to shed 250 jobs as part of a Pounds 6m cuts package it said would be necessary to avoid budget-capping by central government. It is the first council to announce its planned budget for next year, and it said the cuts had been made necessary by the government's plan to cut budgets by 2 per cent. Hounslow's cut is equivalent to 4.7 per cent of its controllable budget and the council predicted that other authorities would have to follow suit. Mr John Chatt, the council leader, said: 'We have gone as far as we can in recommending cuts which will minimise the effect on direct services to the community. If we don't get a decent grant settlement then any further cuts, and the damage they will cause, will be due to the government's failure to listen to our pleas.' The Association of London Authorities said Hounslow was the first London borough to announce its proposals and suggested that a clear pattern of spending intentions would not emerge until December.</p>

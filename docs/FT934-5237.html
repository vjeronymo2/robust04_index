			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Clarke banks on big spending cuts: Slow-burn tax rises will take effect as recovery gains pace Mr Kenneth Clarke delivered an overtly political Budget yesterday, designed to boost the nation's finances with big spending cuts and slow-burn tax rises that will hit large numbers of voters as the economy recovers. He announced measures to defuse public anger and Tory dismay at earlier plans to extend value added tax to domestic fuel and power but singled out home owners, motorists, smokers and holidaymakers for tax increases, effective mainly from April 1995. At the heart of Mr Clarke's skilfully packaged Budget was a cut in the public-sector borrowing requirement next year of about Pounds 6bn, big public spending cuts and tax rises next year of Pounds 1.68bn to add to the Pounds 6.7bn planned by Mr Norman Lamont, his predecessor. Mr Clarke took a calculated gamble with public-sector employees by announcing tough measures to restrain pay as part of a cash freeze in government running costs for the next three years. The chancellor's 'no-nonsense Budget', which for the first time combined spending and tax-raising, surprised the Commons and financial markets with its larger-than-expected cuts in public expenditure in 1994-95. The cuts, he told the House of Commons, were intended to 'sort out the problem of public borrowing once and for all'. They will 'eliminate government borrowing entirely by the end of the decade' and 'establish sound public finances into the next century'. However, Mr Clarke's confidently delivered first Budget plots only modest growth of 2.5 per cent for the economy next year although underlying inflation, at 3.25 per cent, would stay within the 1 per cent to 4 per cent target next year and fall further later. His message was warmly welcomed by industrialists and the financial markets, impressed by the plans to cut public borrowing. The response from some economists was more guarded. They feared that proposals for higher taxes in future years would take spending power out of the economy as it tries to recover from recession. The chancellor followed the example of Mr Lamont's March Budget by announcing only modest tax increases for the coming financial year but a broadening of the tax base to yield big revenue gains in 1995-96 and 1996-97. From April 1995, mortgage interest relief will be granted at only 15 per cent, down from 25 per cent at present and 20 per cent due to come into force next April. Mr Clarke also announced a further cut in the married couple's income tax allowance from 1995 onwards to 15 per cent from 20 per cent due to take effect in 1994-95. But, heeding the Conservative by-election defeats of the past year, Mr Clarke took elaborate pains to draw the sting for poorer households from the extension of VAT to fuel and power. Although he announced indirect taxes on air travel and insurance premiums and increased duties on petrol and tobacco by well above the inflation rate, the chancellor avoided extending VAT to exempt and zero-rated goods and services such as newspapers, food and sewerage charges. He confirmed that the state pension retirement age for women would rise from 60 to 65 but not before the year 2010. As befits a self-proclaimed son of the industrial Midlands, Mr Clarke announced tax and spending measures to help businesses and jobs. He also announced a crackdown on tax avoidance to yield Pounds 2bn over the three years and restrictions on unemployment and invalidity benefit intended to save Pounds 2.5bn annually from the social security budget by 1996-97. His speech bore witness to his career as a minister in many big spending departments before he took over as chancellor in May. He appeared more at ease outlining the government's spending plans than its tax proposals. The Budget set a PSBR of Pounds 38bn for 1994-95, compared with the Pounds 44bn envisaged in Mr Lamont's March Budget, and forecast a steady decline in the deficit to Pounds 12bn by 1997-98 and just Pounds 2bn by 1998-99. The March Budget estimated that the PSBR would still be Pounds 30bn in 1997-98. He announced a Pounds 3.6bn reduction in the government's public-expenditure 'control total' to Pounds 251.3bn in 1994-95. However, the government did not raid its contingency reserve to pay for spending programmes. Instead, cuts in the reserve of Pounds 3.5bn next year and Pounds 3bn in 1995-96 will be used to reduce overall spending. Mr Clarke said he expected the Budget would reduce total public spending in the next three years by about Pounds 10bn below the level assumed in March. After taking account of the beneficial effects of recovery in the economy to a growth rate of 2.5 per cent next year and the first half of 1995, 'the total reduction in public spending over the next three years compared to the March Budget projections will be no less than Pounds 15bn', he said. The chancellor added Pounds 1.675m of new taxes to the Pounds 6.73bn already decided in Mr Lamont's Budget for 1994-95. Mr Clarke's Budget will add Pounds 4.9bn in taxes to the Pounds 10.3bn agreed in the March Budget for 1995-96 and a further Pounds 6.08bn for 1996-97. As a result, the share of tax revenue in national income will rise from 36.5 per cent in this financial year to 39.75 per cent in 1996-97. Some of that may be paid back as tax cuts. One of the justifications Mr Clarke gave for tackling the public-sector deficit was the government's 'long-term tax cutting agenda'. However, the only beneficiaries of tax cuts were businesses. In a move that will cost Pounds 830m in 1994-95, and Pounds 940m the following year, the chancellor announced a 0.2 per cent cut in the main rate of employers' national insurance contributions and 1 per cent reductions in employers' contributions for staff earning less than Pounds 200 a week.

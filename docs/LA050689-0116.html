			<p><P> May 6, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HERE ARE BOOKS YOU CAN JUDGE BY THEIR COVERS  </P> <P> Has your neighbor ever shown you his treasured collection of 2,000 matchbooks?  Does your brother-in-law have a hoard of vintage girlie ties from the 1940s or  garishly patterned Hawaiian shirts that he wears on those truly special  occasions? Are your friends into maniacally collecting cow-related objects or  whimsical salt-and-pepper shakers?  </P> <P> All of these collectible aspects of Americana, as well as the venerable sports  of bowling and miniature golf, are captured for posterity in a handsomely  designed series of books from Abbeville Press.  </P> <P> While the series is more celebratory than scholarly, it is the books' covers  that initially grab your eye. "The Hawaiian Shirt: Its Art and History" was  first published bound in 11 different Hawaiian shirt fabrics. Now in its third  printing, the book offers a selection of four different fabrics.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 3 Holes in Bowling Cover  </P> <P> "Bowl-O-Rama: The Visual Arts of Bowling" has three holes bored in the cover, a  perfect fit for the more literary-minded bowling fanatic. "Miniature Golf"  sports a lush, green Astroturf-like fabric on its cover -- lay it down on the  floor and do some practice putting. A touchable, pink furry udder embellishes  the bovine chomping contentedly on the front of "Wholly Cow," a book about,  well, cow imagery in American culture. "Close Cover Before Striking: The Golden  Age of Matchbook Art" looks like a giant, somewhat worn matchbook. Open the  book and the second page reveals a row of 6-inch-long matches.  </P> <P> The other two entries in the series -- "Vintage Ties of the Forties &amp;  Fifties" and "Great Shakes: Salt and Pepper for All Tastes" -- feature a  multitude of their whimsical subjects on their covers.  </P> <P> "The Hawaiian Shirt" book by H. Thomas Steele started the whole series off in  1984. "When I was 16," Steele says, "I worked in a vintage-clothing store and I  noticed the wide variety of patterns in the Hawaiian shirts that came through,  and started photographing them." Eventually, Steele decided to put together a  book of his and other people's collections. It took him five years to get it  all together and another five years to sell it, which was partly due to his  insistence that his "labor of love" be published in full color.  </P> <P> Walton Rawls, Abbeville Press senior editor, recalls: "It was a risky idea at  the time. Our sales people were against it, but the book sold out almost  immediately."  </P> <P> Abbeville then published "Great Shakes" by Gideon Bosker, which is a visual  treasure house of salt-and-pepper shakers whose designs cleverly exploit the  idea of paired objects. Seemingly every possible combination -- from Laurel and  Hardy, a dog and a fire hydrant, Humpty Dumpty and his wall, to an aspirin and  a martini -- are shown. "All of these collectors are known to each other,"  Rawls explained, "and once we start a book, the alarm goes out over the  grapevine. Somebody calls up with, 'Gee, I hope you're not going to do a book  without my so-and-so piece.' "  </P> <P> </P> <P> Every Aspect Documented  </P> <P> The next book published, "Bowl-O-Rama," also was written by Steele. Every  possible aspect of bowling is visually documented, including trophies, shirts,  patches, balls, graphics and architecture -- conjuring up an almost-vanished  part of American culture. Half of the material in the book is from the Bowling  Museum Hall of Fame in St. Louis. "I saw bowling alleys getting torn down all  over the place, and I thought it had to be catalogued or the next generation  wouldn't know what it was all about," Steele said.  </P> <P> "Close Cover" by Steele, Jim Heimann and Rod Dyer, delves into the crudely  printed but imaginatively designed world of matchbook art, which fell into  decline after the introduction of the lighter. Particularly striking are the  novelty matchbooks that were printed with an image (for example, a row of palm  trees against a mountainous skyline) on each individual match. As the book  comments, these could be so attractive, they were frequently saved in an unused  condition.  </P> <P> For a younger generation accustomed to more subdued neckwear, "Vintage Ties" is  definitely a "I can't believe people actually wore that stuff" book. A poem  from a 1946 Kiwanis Club newsletter, reprinted in the text, reads: "The books I  read and the life I lead/ are sensible, sane and mild./ I like calm hats and I  don't wear spats,/ but I want my neckties wild!"  </P> <P> And wild they are. Ranging from eye-zapping and sometimes downright ugly  abstract designs to neckwear with '40s-style pinup girls cleverly hidden in the  folds, the ties collected in this book were not for the timid. Who could  possibly have worn a tie featuring a glass-beaded and sequin-encrusted horse's  head with a halter made out of gold braid? Would they still admit to it today?  </P> <P> "Miniature Golf" by John Margolies continued the series. Esquire magazine  called it "the definitive pictorial history of the game," although there  probably are not too many, if any, other books devoted to this curious and  uniquely American sport.  </P> <P> From its origins as "the very last of the goofy fads of the '20s" to its  full-fledged flowering in the '50s, this book covers it all. Full-cover  photographs capture a wide variety of imaginative hazards from all over the  country -- Easter Island heads in Key West, Fla.; a family of gorillas fiercely  guarding a hole in Atlantic Beach, N.C.; a pink storybook castle located in  Fountain Valley, Calif.  </P> <P> People who hate cows should at all costs stay away from "Wholly Cow," by Emily  Gwathmey, as every page has at least one blank-faced bovine portrayed in  ceramic, woodcut, oil, papier-mache and other media.  </P> <P> Cow-fanciers, on the other hand, will find udder delight in this celebration of  the "nurturing cow in all her statuesque beauty (who) somehow seems the  ultimate foster mother to the human race." Walt Whitman, Frank Lloyd Wright, D.  H. Lawrence, Theodore Roethke, Paul Bowles and other not-so-famous boviniacs  all wax poetic in their tributes to what is, after all, only a cow.  </P> <P> "Every time we publish a book," senior editor Rawls said, "we get a lot of  submissions for ideas for books that are very similar to what we just did. We  try, however, to do a different kind of thing with each book, instead of  repeating ourselves."  </P> <P> Two new offerings are scheduled to arrive this month. "Cracker Jack Prizes"  will document for posterity all of those eagerly awaited goodies that lay  hidden at the bottom of a box of caramel-covered popcorn. The cover of the book  will feature a movable picture of the Cracker Jack sailor boy and his dog.  </P> <P> Steele's fourth book for Abbeville, "Lick 'Em, Stick 'Em: The Art of the Poster  Stamp," will unearth the lost history of an unusual predecessor to matchbook  advertising. Poster stamps were large, ornately designed non-revenue stamps  that businesses used to promote themselves in the days before color  advertisements in magazines.  </P> <P> Abbeville Press will be promoting itself and the book by including in each copy  a glassine envelope containing real poster stamps especially designed for "Lick  'Em, Stick 'Em."  </P> <P> Upcoming books include one on snow globes ("You know, you shake them up and  down"), eyeglasses of the 1950s ("We have 3-D glasses, sunglasses and one pair  in the shape of the word ZOOM"), ephemera from the Golden Age of travel  (1880-1939), and "a book about ugly lamps." Rawls hastened to correct himself:  "Let's not say that -- the book is actually called 'Turned-On: American  Decorative Lamps of the 1950s.' "  </P></p>

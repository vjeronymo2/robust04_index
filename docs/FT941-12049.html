			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / International Company News: Upjohn rises 6% to Dollars 163.7m Upjohn, the US pharmaceutical company which is trying to respond to series of patent expiries on some of its most important drugs, reported a 6 per cent increase in net income to Dollars 163.7m in its fourth quarter. The result left it with full-year net income 21 per cent ahead at Dollars 392.4m, but the company said if all unusual items and the previous year's Dollars 222.9m charge for accounting changes were excluded, net income from continuing operations would have been 5 per cent ahead at Dollars 585m. Mr John Zabriskie, the newly-appointed chairman and chief executive, said Upjohn's respectable performance in 1993 showed the company's concerted efforts to meet short-term challenges were working. 'Our human healthcare products showed volume growth worldwide, and products we have introduced in the US since 1992 achieved excellent market penetration,' he said. Mr Zabriskie acknowledged Upjohn was seeing the effects of the loss of US patent protection on several important products, but said it had limited the effects through careful planning of its generic strategy. 'We expect this strategy to help mitigate the negative effects of generic competition in 1994,' he said. Worldwide sales of human health care products increased 2 per cent for the year but decreased 7 per cent in the fourth quarter. Worldwide agricultural sales decreased 2 per cent for the year but increased 10 per cent in the fourth quarter. Total sales for the full year were Dollars 3.61bn, against Dollars 3.55bn last time, while fourth-quarter sales were Dollars 926.3m, down from Dollars 967.1m. Earnings per share, undiluted, were up to Dollars 2.18 from Dollars 1.78 for the year and to 92 cents from 86 cents for the quarter.</p>

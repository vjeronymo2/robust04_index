			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / UK Company News: International publishing boost for Euromoney EUROMONEY Publications, the publisher of specialist magazines, yesterday reported a 35 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 13.8m in the year to September 30. The company warned, however, that first-quarter revenues were likely to be down on last time because 'upheavals in foreign exchange markets, Europe's political difficulties and the emerging troubles of many international banks have weakened confidence'. Euromoney, 76 per cent of which is owned by the Daily Mail and General Trust, said it achieved record results from international financial publishing, with a sharp rise in revenues from central and eastern Europe. Euromoney said that regional magazines in Latin America and Asia also produced record results, as did energy, law and tax publishing and database and information services. Publications in the aviation and leasing sectors continued to suffer from the recession in their markets. Operating profits rose by 47 per cent to Pounds 11.6m and earnings by 33 per cent to 44.4p a share. A final dividend of 21.5p makes a total of 29.5p (22.5p). Since the half year Euromoney has bought four companies for a total of Pounds 1.9m, including Asia Law and Practice and Mundy Perry, publishers of a port operators' and users journal. The best Euromoney performer was international financial publishing, with operating profit up from Pounds 6.05m to Pounds 8.78m followed by law and tax publishing up from Pounds 899,000 to Pounds 1.28m.</p>

			<p><P> June 29, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> 2 INITIATIVES WOULD LIMIT OFFICEHOLDERS  </P> <P> An initiative aimed at limiting the terms of state elected officials, sponsored  by Los Angeles County Supervisor Pete Schabarum, has qualified for the November  ballot, the secretary of state's office announced. It would limit all elected  state officials to two four-year terms except members of the Assembly, who  would be limited to three two-year terms.  </P> <P> Another initiative on the same subject, proposed by Atty. Gen. John K. Van de  Kamp, also qualified. This one would limit state legislators and members of the  State Board of Equalization to 12 years in office, would prevent future  governors and other statewide elected officials from serving more than eight  years and would sharply reduce the amount of money candidates could spend on  elections. Among 11 other initiatives that also qualified by the deadline are  proposals to protect timberlands, raise alcohol taxes, outlaw fishing with gill  nets and allow state prisoners to work for private businesses.  </P></p>

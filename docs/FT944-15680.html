			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Survey of International Telecommunications (10):  The debate intensifies - Information 'Superhighways' / Superhighways are flavour of the month with politicians and techno-buffs alike. But while they attract public attention with promises of science fiction-type services, they are also a target for cynics who question their commercial viability The debate is hotting up over new superhighways - telecommunications networks that will carry multi-media services to homes and businesses. The issues are whether or not these superhighways should be laid automatically in every town, village and street, whether or not there is a return on the investment - or whether they should only go where they are profitable. The telephone companies want to be free to develop the superhighway according to commercial demand. But politically, they are under pressure to ensure that all members of the population, rich and poor, rural and urban, have equal opportunity to access it. Information is a now a commodity, and people would be disadvantaged by not having access to it. In the UK, the Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown said recently that he feared a society of 'information haves and have nots.' The information super-highway could be used to widen the gap between rich and poor, between the affluent urban areas and remote village communities. And US vice president Al Gore laid down in his original proposal for the National Information Infrastructure (the official name for the US superhighway) that the information superhighway must be accessible to all people everywhere. The superhighways will be constructed from fibre optic cable because fibre has the necessary capacity for transmitting multimedia services. Fibre can carry data at speeds up to 2 gigabits per second. Old fashioned copper is limited to 64 kilobits per second. But a fibre optic network is expensive, especially if the fibre is to replace all of the existing copper lines into individual premises - known as the local loop. BT, for example, estimates Pounds 15bn to take fibre to the majority of UK population, rising to Pounds 20bn to reach the most remote parts of the country. The phone companies are concerned about getting a return on that investment. Operating the superhighway profitably will not be as easy as on the existing copper networks - and for that reason, the phone companies are reluctant to invest in the fibre infrastructure until they are sure of getting a return. Industry experts argue that the present method of charging for calls - where prices are determined by the distance of the call and the capacity of the line - cannot be sustained on a fibre network - 'when you have fibre in the local loop, you have an infinite supply of capacity. For anyone to sell that on a bandwidth related tariff is a nonsense,' says Malcolm Matson, chairman of National Telecable. BT is exploring new ways of tariffing as part of a trial of multimedia services in Ipswich, Suffolk. John Drew, of BT's corporate strategy department, recognises that changes will be needed - 'we don't want to be constrained by 80 years of existing tariff structures.' Hepoints out that the information superhighway is not the same as the phone service as we know it today. The difference lies in who provides the content - 'in voice telephony, it's simple: the users generate the content. In multimedia, the users do not generate the content. They access it on a service.' In commercial terms, the cost of providing voice telephony is the cost of the line. On a superhighway, the providers of the service want payment, and therefore the cost of the service embraces the content as well as the line. Mr Matson believes the solution is to separate the ownership of the fibre infrastructure from the service provision. Such a structure, not unlike the current set-up for mobile communications in the UK, would provide more flexibility for service pricing. 'The separation of infrastructure from service provision is certainly where the industry is going to end up. But it is not something the telephone companies will do voluntarily,' comments Andrew Entwhistle of the Cambridge-based telecoms consultancy, Analysys. Demand for multimedia services is another concern. In the long term, new services - ranging from dial-up books and compact disks, to interactive education could be made available. But in the immediate future, the main demand is seen to be entertainment - movies and computer games. The BT trial will concentrate on a video on demand service, as will a similar trial by Time Warner in Orlando, Florida. The theory of video-on-demand is that there is an existing market for video rental, which would be largely replaced by an on-line market. But Mr Entwhistle casts doubt on its potential size: 'There is a major threshold determining how much people will spend to get more than cable TV. The initial hypothesis that people would double their expenditure to get interactive TV has been exploded. There's not much evidence that people will do that.' John Drew believes that superhighways will actually need to begin with a much more familiar service: broadcast entertainment. It would be a more obvious wedge to put in the consumer's door, and one from which to introduce the new multimedia services in a gradual way. This is why BT, for example, insists it wants its licence altered to permit it to carry broadcast entertainment before it will install fibre to every home. The phone companies therefore question the political assumption about people's right to have access to the superhighway - especially if the phone companies, not national governments, are to foot the bill: 'What service do people have a right to?' asks Mr Drew. The idea that everyone has a right to phone services stems from the days when the phone network was in its infancy. The telephone gave people a facility to communicate with others. The super-highway, however, looks like being primarily a medium of entertainment: thus, there is a case that the commercial market should dictate who gets it. Put in simple terms, people do not have the automatic right to dial-up Madonna movies. And if people do not have a right to it, and there is no clear profit in it, they won't get it. In the UK, the Telecommunications Users Association is pessimistic about the chances of fibre connections to every home - 'realistically, it will never happen,' says John Skarratt, TUA director. However, the phone companies are pursuing a technical alternative to fibre, which may provide a commercially expedient solution. Known as ADSL (asymetric digital subscriber loop), the new technology operates at up to 6 megabits over an existing copper phone line. It is nowhere near the speed of fibre, but could be sufficient for the entertainment and other consumer-oriented services.</p>

			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Corporate news affects individual ratings BOURSES were mixed, with individual company stories making their impact here and there, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS took some comfort from comments by Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy that the franc would not be devalued, although this did little to ease pressure on the currency in foreign exchange markets. The CAC-40 index closed 1.46 lower at 1,735.23, having languished at a day's low of 1,707.05, in turnover of some FFr2bn. Rumous that BNP might become a privatisation candidate should there be a change of government next year excited interest with the CI's advancing FFr15.10 to FFr419.00. Other financials were generally firmer with Paribas up FFr6.60 to FFr339.60 and Suez FFr1.90 firmer at FFr233.40 while Societe Generale slipped FFr2 to FFr576. FRANKFURT ended with an absence of Christmas cheer. Although the DAX index ended 4.10 higher at 1,476.17, retailers were dejected with Asko DM40 down at DM610 and Kaufhof DM5.50 lower at DM391.50 as stock market turnover fell from DM3.5bn to DM3.0bn. German retailers, who enjoyed a two-year boom after the opening of the Berlin Wall in 1989, have been caught in a sharp downturn as rising unemployment and uncertainties over future tax increases depress consumer sentiment. Forecasts yesterday included falls in earnings per share of up to 10 per cent this year. AMSTERDAM came to life again after a dull few days with Nutricia prominent after forecasting lower than expected second half profits and reorganisation plans after the close on Wednesday. Its shares ended the day down Fl 14.10 or 11.7 per cent at Fl 110.40. The CBS Tendency index eased 0.1 to 103.0. Institutions seemed unimpressed by news that Daf had secured loans of some Fl 190m from the Belgian and Dutch governments, and some analysts commented that the truck manufacturer still faced serious long-term problems. The shares, however, improved 40 cents to Fl 6.50. Nedlloyd slipped 40 cents to Fl 30.20 after rumours, later denied, that Mr Torstein Hagen, who holds some 25 per cent of the group's equity, might be planning to force the sale of the shipping division. BRUSSELS closed fractionally lower, failing to benefit from a technical recovery in Petrofina and a surge in the steelmaker, Cockerill. The Bel-20 index closed 0.36 lower at 1,105.99 in turnover of BFr850m. Cockerill closed BFr10, or 11.8 per cent higher at BFr95 after an early low of BFr79, and a high of BFr100 after it confirmed plans to pay an unchanged 1992 net preferred dividend of BFr9. The oil major Petrofina, hard-hit in recent days after announcing a severe cut in its 1992 dividend, closed up BFr100 at BFr7,540. ZURICH recovered late on a firmer tone on Wall Street, the SMI index closing 4.8 higher at 2,026.7. VIENNA fell sharply after steep falls in OMV and other blue chip stocks. The ATX index closed 17.82 lower at 720.95 with OMV dropping Sch41 or 6.6 per cent to Sch577 on heavy selling by foreign institutions. Some analysts said that while the oil group had been weak over the last few days there was no significant factor which sparked the fall. Elsewhere, Strabag fell Sch30 to Sch920, Wienerberger lost Sch35 to Sch2,805, while Creditanstalt preferred lost a further Sch8 to Sch413 following Wednesday's news that it planned to cut its dividend. STOCKHOLM recovered some ground as buyers returned to Astra, which has been under pressure following a disappointing analysts' meeting earlier in the week. The Affarsvarlden Index advanced 6.5 to 873.3 in turnover of SKr713m. Astra free shares rose SKr6 to SKr717 while SKF free shares lost SKr4.50 to SKr67 on news that it expects a SKr1.8bn loss in 1992 after taking a restructuring charge of SKr1.1bn. HELSINKI fell on higher domestic interest rates and on continued profit-taking after the sharp recovery this autumn, the Hex index ending 16.4, or 1.9 per cent lower at 830.6.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                    FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- December 17                                        THE EUROPEAN SERIES Hourly changes                 Open      10.30     11.00     12.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100           1035.11   1034.19   1033.73   1034.27 FT-SE Eurotrack 200           1116.38   1115.05   1116.26   1118.81  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                    Dec 16    Dec 15    Dec 14  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100               1036.62   1038.14   1041.18 FT-SE Eurotrack 200               1117.67   1115.23   1116.33  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                 13.00     14.00     15.00     Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100           1032.81   1033.89   1033.99   1034.41 FT-SE Eurotrack 200           1118.20   1119.62   1119.20   1119.02  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                         Dec 11           Dec 10  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100                    1044.03          1049.63 FT-SE Eurotrack 200                    1117.72          1123.58  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 -  1035.12 ; 200 -  1120.80 Low/day: 100 -  1032.56  200 -  1114.83  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

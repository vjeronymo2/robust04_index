			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SANTA MONICA MOVING TO PHASE OUT USE OF CFCS  </P> <P> The Santa Monica City Council this week directed the city attorney to draft an  ordinance that would phase out the use of ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons,  or CFCs, over two years. The ordinance is expected to come up for a formal  council vote next month.  </P> <P> City officials said the measure would affect 44 businesses, mostly auto repair  shops, which use CFCs to recharge auto air-conditioning units, and appliance  repair shops, which use CFCs to recharge refrigerators.  </P> <P> The ordinance would require auto shops to install CFC recycling equipment by  Jan. 1, 1991. It would require appliance repair shops and home air-conditioning  maintainance businesses to use recycling equipment by Jan. 1, 1992.  </P> <P> The measure also would prohibit the sale of Freon, an air-conditioning  recharger that can be purchased at auto-parts shops, after Jan. 1, 1991. Fire  extinguishers containing halon, another ozone-depleting chemical, could not be  tested under the ordinance.  </P></p>

			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Directors' transactions Domestic and General is involved mainly in the insurance of domestic appliances. The group has been a strong performer relative to the market over the last year. In March, it announced interim results which reflected the steady increase in the amount of business written. The size of the sale by three directors is accounted-for partly by the high share price - around 1915p. But each director retains a fair amount of stock. Takare, the company that provides care for the elderly, appeared on this list not long ago following a purchase of 83,000 shares by the chairman. But the most recent transaction was undertaken following some difference of opinion in the boardroom. Deverok Pritchard sold more than 12.4m at around 249p, and his job was changed from managing director to a non-executive position. But he retains a stake in the company. PizzaExpress's recent performance has been steady, and the sales recorded earlier this month at 132p were near the most recent trading high. The chairman, Peter Boizot, has sold 2m, which accounted for 3.7 per cent of the company. This leaves him with more than 5.7m and he has undertaken not to sell any more shares for at least another year.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------    DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                             No of Company                    Sector      Shares    Value    directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Arjo Wiggins                PP&amp;P      128,000      366         1* Bradstock                   Insu      106,250      149         2 BTR                         DivI      250,000      953         1* Courtaulds Textiles         Text       82,817      444         1* Domestic &amp; General          Insu      280,000     5320         3 Flying Flowers              RetG      100,000       98         1 Gardiner Group              Dist      100,000       25         1 Guinness                    SW&amp;C       35,046      165         1* Hall Engineering             Eng       29,783       78         2 Hillsdown Holdings          FdMa      500,000      900         1 Hodder Headline             Mdia       10,000       40         1 Int Bus Comms               Mdia       53,745      217         1 Magellan Industries         Text      350,000      609         1* MAI                         OthF       51,000      141         1* Mallett                     RetG      104,000      107         1 Oliver Group                RetG      100,000       50         1 Pittards                    Text      174,000      115         1 PizzaExpress                L&amp;Hl    2,000,000     2400         1 Polar                       Dist       15,000       33         1 Prudential Corp             LifA      242,000      787         2* Psion                       E&amp;EE       25,000       64         1 Rank Organisation           L&amp;Hl        5,000       21         1 Smith, WH                 RetG       57,113      299         1* A  Syltone                  EngV      100,000      167         1 T &amp; N                       EngV       16,000       37         1 Takare                      Hlth   12,486,102    31090         1 Thorpe FW                 E&amp;EE       85,500      156         1* TI Group                     Eng      646,000     2519         1* UDO Holdings                OS&amp;B       12,750       29         2 Weir Group                   Eng       50,000      163         1*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Barbour Index               Mdia      101,650      223         1 House of Fraser             RetG      130,550      235         3 Kewill Systems              SSer       10,000       25         1 Lucas Industries            EngV       15,000       30         1 Ross Group                  Dist      500,000      100         1 Smith New Court             OthF       10,000       37         1 Yorkshire Food              FdMa      115,000      121         5  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

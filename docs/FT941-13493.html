			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chinese state gold purchases fall by 40 per cent China's state monopoly over gold took a battering last year with purchases falling 40 per cent. That was the first time since the 1970s that gold purchases by the state had fallen and the slump underlined the increasing reluctance of producers to yield gold to the state at prices well below those prevailing internationally. Mr Ai Dacheng, vice-director of the Gold Bureau under the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, blamed the slump on official tardiness in raising the official purchase price. The People's Bank, China's Central Bank, which holds the monopoly, increased on 1 September the purchase price to Yn2,986 (USDollars 343) a troy ounce from Yn1,697, but the official price has not budged since and is more than 10 per cent below the world market. Mr Ai said gold output was higher in China in 1993 than the previous year, but did not provide details. China produced about 110 tonnes of gold in 1992. Unofficial estimates put China's in-ground reserves at 3,000 tonnes. The country's gold miners, fed up with meagre returns from their efforts, have been selling on the black market for the past year or so to take advantage of surging demand in China for gold and gold jewellery. The crumbling of the state monopoly of gold purchasing is certain to fuel stronger demands for the establishment of an active, government-supervised gold exchange in China that would enable the metal to be freely traded at world prices. But Mr Ai doubted that such a market would be established soon. He described the issue as 'complicated' and said that the People's Bank was 'not quite ready' for such a step. Demand for gold is strong among Chinese consumers anxious to secure a hedge against inflation which was running at more than 20 per cent in urban centres late last year. Figures on demand for gold in China are unreliable since such a large quantity is being being traded on the black market. In 1992 gold consumption was put at 250 tonnes, but that almost certainly understated the Chinese people's appetite for gold.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Dino Vaiano report: "And Biggest Rumor Points to Di Pietro </F> as Justice Minister"]    [Text] Rome -- The tam-tam had started before polling had  ended. With the first whiff of the pole for freedom's victory,  the heavy maneuvers began for the new nomenclature. Who will  enter [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi's government? Who will  man the Second Republic's control room? The parliamentary curb  market is providing a continuous stream of candidates. Offices  of every kind. Ministers, presidents of commissions, even  possible undersecretaries. The paths of power are already  thronged just 24 hours after the vote. The MSI [Italian Social  Movement] is preparing its ministerial suits, the League has its  sights set high -- [League lower house floor leader] Roberto  Maroni has put himself forward for prime minister and [League  Senate floor leader] Enrico Speroni for the presidency of the  Senate -- whilst Forza Italia is orchestrating the future  governmental and institutional positions. The most widely  tipped persons for ministerial posts are obviously Berlusconi's  most loyal supporters. Political scientist Giuliano Urbani is  garnering in the jobs. He is said to be in the running for the  post of minister of institutional reform, the job of  Berlusconi's undersecretary, and even the presidency of the  Chamber of Deputies. Economist Antonio Martino, Mr. personal  income tax, is likely to disembark at the Finance Ministry,  magistrate Tiziana Parenti at the Ministry of Justice, and  General Luigi Caligaris at the Ministry of Defense. But the  biggest of all the rumors circulating yesterday was that of a  possible highly secret attempt to place Judge Antonio Di Pietro  in the Justice Ministry. A few months ago, however, the Clean  Hands judge had clearly expressed his preference for the judge's  robe rather than political adventure.    Economics minister? As treasury superminister, the pole for  freedom would like to see Mario Monti, Rector of the Bocconi  University, but it is also looking at the Bank of Italy General  Director Lamberto Dini, a personality well known on  international markets. The new government will certainly  include Marco Pannella -- Berlusconi has already said as much so  in advance -- who is said to be in the running for a number of  ministerial positions: minister of foreign affairs, of justice,  or of community policy. Candidates for the Foreign Ministry  include [former president] Francesco Cossiga and Sergio Romano  (but there are also people who see Martino in this job). And  the former president of the republic is seen as a possible  candidate to lead a center-right government should Berlusconi  fail to stitch up an agreement with his electoral allies. But  yesterday [National Alliance Secretary] Gianfranco Fino refuted  rumors about Cossiga. The spotlights are also pointed on the  election of the presidents of the Chamber and the Senate. Could  they be [liberal] Alfredo Biondi and [Senate spraker] Giovannia  Spadolini?    The "ministry sweepstake" is waiting to be filled in  political Rome. The Interior Ministry, after years of being  headed up by a Christian democrat, could be taken over by League  politician Roberto Maroni who, along with Giancarlo Paglierini  and Vito Gnutti, incarnate the Lombards' ministerial vocation.  The pole position for finance is held by Antonio Martino,  followed by Paglierini and tax lawyer Giuli Tremonti (as a  technician, as he is a Pact for Italy follower). Paglierini,  together with economists Carlo Scognamiglio and Pietro Armani  (economist close to the National Alliance), is in line too for  the Budget or Industry Ministry. Another candidate who put  himself forward yesterday for an economic position is Stefano De  Luca (Center Union), and a large portion of the names indicated  in the various lists are also circulating as possible  chairpersons of the parliamentary committees, key posts for the  future economic policy, of which in the Cencelli Manual  [power-sharing system] of the First Republic there were nearly  as many as there were ministerial positions.    MSI politician Domenico Fisichella could go to the Ministry  of Public Education, and Christian Democratic Center politician  Ombretta Fumigalli Carulli to Posts and Telecommunications.  Also League politician Vito Gnutti to the Ministry of Labor,  National Alliance politician Publio Fiori to the Ministry of  Health, and Raffaele Costa (Center Union) to the Ministry of  Transport and Public Works. Further potential MSI ministerial  candidates are Domenico Mennitti, Giulio Maceratini, and General  Luigi Ramponi.</p>

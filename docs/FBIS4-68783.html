			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V.M. Agalkin, doctor of technical sciences and </F> professor at International Construction Institute, and V.  Karavayev, doctor of economic sciences at International Economic  and Political Research Institute of Russian Academy of Sciences:  "Possibilities for Foreign Investment in Russia, Ukraine,  Belarus, and Kazakhstan"]    [Text] Economic affairs in Russia have been accompanied by  unique changes in recent years. These changes have seemed  chaotic at times, but now they are clearly taking the form of a  system contributing to economic stability. Although this  stabilization still requires a great deal of time, we can  already ascertain the emergence of the most important market  elements of the future system, primarily in the spheres of  property relations, privatization, credit and monetary policy,  and foreign trade relations.    What kind of opportunities can these changes offer foreign  businessmen in Russia and other CIS countries? The following is  an analysis of these possibilities, based on studies by the  International Construction Institute and the International  Economic and Political Research Institute of the Russian Academy  of Sciences.  <H5>  Foreign Investment in Russian Economy </H5>   Russian laws have allowed the creation of joint ventures  within Russia since 1987, and the Law of the RSFSR of 4 July  1991 "On Foreign Investment in the RSFSR" also allowed  enterprises with 100-percent foreign participation.    On 1 July 1993 there were 9,125 joint ventures registered in  Russia, and around 4,000 of them had been formed in the  preceding three months. The combined capital stock of the  enterprises amounted to 62.7 billion rubles, including 7.56  billion dollars in foreign capital (data for 1 April 1993). This  amount, however, does not exceed 4 percent of the value of the  fixed capital of all Russian enterprises. Additions of new  foreign capital to capital stock increased 3.9-fold in the first  quarter of 1993.    The joint ventures still produce only around 0.7 percent of  the gross output and employ only 0.3 percent of the able-bodied  population. It is interesting that in spite of the general slump  in production (by 30 percent during the period from 1992 to the  end of the first quarter of 1993) and in the total output of  registered joint ventures, more than 70 percent are producing  goods, while the rest have not begun production operations yet.    The distribution of joint ventures among different branches  of the economy is the following (in percentages):    industry--6.7;    trade and food service--9.3;    construction--5.8;    transportation and communications--4.6.    For the sake of comparison, in 1989 the proportional number  of industrial enterprises was under 30 percent, and most of the  joint ventures were concentrated in the trade and service  sectors.    Italy has 511 joint ventures in Russia (5.5 percent of the  total), surpassed only by the United States, FRG, and England  (Figure 1) [not reproduced; converted to table].    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Participation by Governments of Different Countries in Joint Ventures in Rus-|  |sia                                                                          |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Country                               |Percentage of total                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |United States                         |15.7                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Germany                               |12.5                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |England                               |6.1                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Italy                                 |5.6                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Austria                               |5.2                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Poland                                |4.8                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Finland                               |4.7                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |PRC                                   |3.8                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Switzerland                           |3.5                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |France                                |3.1                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Sweden                                |2.6                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Bulgaria                              |2.6                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Canada                                |2.3                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Japan                                 |1.9                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Hungary                               |1.8                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Foreign investors recently expressed an interest in  participating in privatization processes after the cancellation  of many of the restrictions on the acquisition of enterprises  slated for privatization and on land use rights.    According to Russian Central Bank Regulation No 16 of 16  July  1993, foreign businessmen who are not residents may open special  ruble accounts in Russian banks for settlements in privatization  projects. According to estimates, by the beginning of 1993  foreigners had acquired around 12 percent of the stock in  enterprises undergoing privatization in Russia. Several  well-known large enterprises, including Lukoil (Tyumen Oblast),  plan to sell their stock in Western stock markets.    All of this suggests that the investment climate in Russia  is  gradually becoming increasingly acceptable to foreign  businessmen, but how does it compare to the situation in other  CIS countries?  <H5>  Comparison of Investment Climate in Russia, Ukraine, </H5> Belarus, and Kazakhstan    These republics were not chosen at random: They accounted  for  more than nine-tenths of the national wealth, production  potential, natural resources, and foreign economic ties of the  former USSR (Figure 2) [not reproduced; converted to table].    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Republic                 |Area, thousands of km    |Population, thousands    |  |                         |[.sup]2[/]             |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Russia                   |17,075.4                 |136,532                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Ukraine                  |607.7                    |49,881                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Belarus                  |207.6                    |9,451                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Kazakhstan               |2,717.3                  |14,564                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      When we use the term "investment climate," we are referring  to the fairly complex entity made up of the legislative  confines, economic-administrative mechanism, and political,  social, environmental, and other conditions of the host country.  The investment climate may be judged by the method of expert  evaluation, the method most commonly used in international  practice.    A multi-factor analysis was conducted with the aid of 31  indicators, arranged in five groups:    administrative and legal conditions (4 factors);    social, political, and environmental conditions (5  factors);    foreign economic conditions (6 factors);    economic potential of country (9 factors);    level of market relations (7 factors).    Each indicator was evaluated by a group of specialists on a  scale from 1 to 10, with the highest number of points  corresponding to the most favorable conditions. After that the  rating for each group of factors and the overall rating were  calculated for each country. There were four separate  indicators, for example, in the group of "administrative and  legal conditions":    stability of economic legislation;    taxes on foreign investments;    administrative conditions;    guarantees and protection for foreign investments.    For the first indicator, Russia and Ukraine received four  points each, Belarus received eight, and Kazakhstan received  ten. The grades for the second indicator were nine, nine, and  ten points respectively, and so forth. The results of the study  are illustrated in Figure 3 [not reproduced; converted to  table]. The results did not reveal any significant differences  in expert evaluations of the investment climate in these  countries. These were evaluations of conditions at the end of  the first quarter of 1993.

In terms of these parameters, Russia  surpassed all of the other countries combined, and this was the  reason it finished in first place. Russia was also the leader in  terms of radical and consistent market reform. Measures are  being taken for financial stabilization, a strict monetary  policy, and a stronger ruble. The rate of inflation has been  lowered, the recession has been curbed, and the exchange rate of  the ruble has been stabilized.    The Law on Foreign Investments, which extended the national  regulations adopted in 1991 to foreign investors of capital,  already needs to be adjusted with a view to accumulated  experience. A law on free economic zones and concessions is  being considered. Continuity in the development of laws and the  maintenance of invariable rules of play for investors are  important for a better investment climate.    Nevertheless, opportunities for foreign investment in Russia  are still growing: 100-percent foreign enterprises and  subsidiaries are being established in addition to the  traditional joint ventures; opportunities are being created for  operations by joint and foreign banks, for the purchase of stock  in enterprises undergoing privatization, and for the long-term  leasing of parcels of land.    A system of services for foreign investors is being  established. Presidential Edict No 282 of 26 February 1993  created the National Agency for the Insurance of Foreign  Investments in the Russian Federation Against Non-Commercial  Risks, and Presidential Edict No 184 of 2 February 1993 created  the State Investment Company, with over a billion dollars in  capital stock.    The present situation is quite paradoxical in  Ukraine--second to Russia in terms of production  potential, but last in terms of the overall investment climate.  Ukraine's strong points are its geographic location, its  proximity to Western partners, its ports, and its developed  infrastructure. Ukraine's industrial potential is also highly  developed, and there are favorable conditions for the  development of agriculture in basic and processing industries.  The new laws on foreign investments are quite liberal.    All of this is nullified, however, by Ukraine's  exceptionally  severe economic crisis and imprudent economic policy. Ukraine is  lagging behind perceptibly in the sphere of market reform after  wasting approximately a year to see the results of the reforms  in Russia. This was followed by the choice of the most drastic  form of shock therapy, but the genuine threat of social turmoil  forced the government to retreat. The result was the escalation  of hyperinflation and the complete devaluation of the recently  instituted national currency--the karbovanets. This affected  foreign investors because the government had to cancel some of  the tax privileges they had been granted earlier.    Surpassed by its neighbors in terms of natural resources and  production potential, Belarus is not regarded as a  leader in economic reform. In spite of this, the state is ahead  of its neighbors in terms of the rate of increase in the number  of joint ventures, attesting to its appeal to foreign investors.  Belarus' strong points, in addition to its convenient geographic  location on the shortest route to Western Europe, are its  sociopolitical stability, its liberal laws on foreign  investments, the strong guarantees it has established for them,  and--what is most important--its unchanging rules of play.  Belarus also benefits from its skilled and highly productive  labor force. Because Belarus is the smallest of these four  countries, however, it has fewer spheres for the investment of  capital.    The economic policy of the Belarusian Government is not as  reform-oriented as the policy in Russia or Kazakhstan. This has  guaranteed its comparative economic stability. The recession,  for example, is much less severe here; the level of consumer  prices is lower, although inflation does exist--largely because  of Belarus' close economic interaction with Russia and Ukraine.  Belarus was effectively crowded out of the ruble zone, and its  national quasi-currency--the settlement coupon--is extremely  weak, complicating settlements with its partners.    Kazakhstan's strong point is its natural wealth.  The country is close to Russia in this respect, in terms of the  variety of its resources if not in terms of total reserves.  Furthermore, it is distinguished by its gas and oil fields and  its largely undeveloped deposits of ores of nonferrous and rare  metals. Kazakhstan has the most highly developed legislative  base for foreign investments. It has already passed laws on  foreign investment, free economic zones, concessions, and so  forth. It has stable legal and economic-administrative  regulations for foreign investors, and the government  effectively encourages investments. Major investment projects in  the oil and gas industry are being carried out with the  participation of leading corporations in the United States,  England, France, and Japan. The market reform policies of the  president and government of Kazakhstan are being pursued  consistently, without any delays or interruptions, although  there has been a recent tendency toward stronger government  regulation of some economic processes, particularly the rise in  prices and income. In addition, the political situation is  essentially stable.    The economy of Kazakhstan, however, is closely related to  the  Russian economy and is experiencing a critical decline of  production and investment activity and a rate of inflation  slightly higher than the Russian rate. Kazakhstan is still in  the ruble zone and is striving for closer economic integration  within the CIS framework and for stronger regional cooperation  in Central Asia. From the standpoint of the foreign investor,  however, Kazakhstan appears to have a relatively underdeveloped  infrastructure and serious environmental problems.    This study revealed the most promising sectors and spheres  of  foreign investment in the economy of the four countries in  question. In Russia they are the petroleum and petrochemical  industries and woodworking, as well as shipbuilding, aircraft  and automotive engineering, agricultural machinery production  (particularly for family farms), medicine and medical equipment  production, the processing of agricultural raw materials, the  food distribution network, the conversion of defense production  units, and others. In Ukraine these sectors and spheres also  include sectors undergoing conversion, particularly satellite  telecommunications, radar, gas turbine production, corn,  sunflower, and sugar beet farming, the production of  agricultural machinery and equipment for the food industry, and  others. In Belarus these spheres are potash salt extraction and  processing, mineral fertilizer production, mineral water  production, the pulp and paper industry, and medicine  production. In Kazakhstan they are the oil and gas industry, the  extraction of nonferrous and rare metal ores, nonferrous  metallurgy, the meat industry, light industry, mining equipment  production, automotive engineering, and others.    In these states there is a need for investments in the  storage and processing of agricultural products, the production,  shipment, and sale of food products, the development of the  production, social, and market infrastructure, and the training  of personnel for the market economy.  <H5>  In Lieu of a Conclusion </H5>   This study presents an overview of foreign investment  opportunities in the Russian economy, but the businessman  considering investments of this kind will have many specific  questions. The International Construction Institute has compiled  summaries of Russian legislation and practical aids on the  following topics to answer some of these questions:    --How can an enterprise be established with foreign capital  in Russia?    --How can an enterprise dealing in foreign currency be  opened  in Russia?    --How is land acquired in Russia?    --What kind of information is essential for the use of  Russian mineral resources?    --What kind of taxes have to be paid in Russia?    --The rules of play in the Russian market:    currency regulation;    export-import regulation;    customs regulation.    --What do construction projects in Russia entail?    --The Russian construction complex (statistics).    --Housing policy in Russia.    --Banking in Russia.    --The capital market (current reports).    --The bankruptcy of enterprises in Russia--a condition  preventable by legal means.    --A survey of the experience in privatization in Russia.    --A comparative analysis of the investment climate in  Russia.    Counseling and assistance can be offered in all of these  fields, and it might be useful to do this in the magazine, with  a view to the actual experience of the International  Construction Institute in working with Banca Agricola Mantovana  and Intesa Finanziaria (Brescia).    Note: The International Construction Institute is a  research and consulting organization which was founded to  promote foreign investment in Russia and other CIS countries.  The institute's foreign founder is Banca Agricola Mantovana and  its Russian founders are the Academy of the National Economy of  the RF Government, the Russian Academy of Sciences, the  International Builders Union, and the Tekhnopromeksport foreign  trade organization.

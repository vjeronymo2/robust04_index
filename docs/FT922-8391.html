			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / European blow to equal pension rights THE CAMPAIGN for equal pension rights for men and women in the UK suffered a setback yesterday. The European Court of Justice in Luxembourg gave a preliminary opinion that European Community law does not require equal treatment between men and women in National Insurance contributions. The advocate-general's opinion in a case brought by the Equal Opportunities Commission is not binding on the full court, which will give a final decision later. In most cases the court upholds the advocate-general's opinion. The EOC said it was disappointed by the opinion. It had sought a declaration that the UK government was in breach of an obligation in the EC social security directive to give equal treatment in statutory social security. To qualify for a state pension in the UK, men must have paid National Insurance contributions for at least 44 years. But for women the figure is 39 years. After the age of 60 women may not make any further NI contributions. But working men between the ages 60 and 64 must pay NI contributions even if they have already contributed for 44 years. The advocate-general's opinion is in stark contrast to recent European Court decisions on equal treatment in the employment and pension fields. In the Marshall case in 1986, the court ruled that women in public-sector employment had the right to remain in work until the same age as male colleagues. In the 1990 Barber case involving occupational pension schemes, the court ruled that men and women should receive equal pensions as well as equal pay for equal work. The stumbling block in the present case appears to be that the social security directive specifically permits member states to differentiate between state pension ages for men and women - though it also sets out a number of aspects of state pension schemes where equal treatment must apply. The advocate-general concluded that where a member state has a fixed pension age differing according to sex, it 'may still derogate from the principle of equal treatment laid down in the (social security) directive . . . unless such unequal treatment of men can be eliminated by the national court without unduly jeopardising the coherence or financial equilibrium of the national social security system concerned'. The government has already announced its intention to move towards a common state pension age. Letters, Page 21</p>

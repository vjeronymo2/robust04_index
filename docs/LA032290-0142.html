			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S., SOVIETS ARE LECTURED BY MANDELA;  </P> <P> APARTHEID: THE BLACK NATIONALIST BOLDLY SUMMONS BAKER AND SHEVARDNADZE TO  SEPARATE MEETINGS.  </P> <P> South African black nationalist leader Nelson R. Mandela, savoring the sort of  treatment usually reserved for a head of state, summoned Soviet Foreign  Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and Secretary of State James A. Baker III to a  rented house Wednesday for back-to-back lectures on the evils of apartheid.  </P> <P> With Baker at his side, Mandela told reporters that the secretary of state's  planned meeting today in Cape Town with South African President Frederik W. de  Klerk might cause the rest of the world to ease the pressure on the white  minority government.  </P> <P> "We do not think that there has been any fundamental change in the policy of  the (South African) government," said Mandela, who was released last month  after 27 years in a South African prison. "There is nothing which Mr. De Klerk  has done up to now which would require a change of strategy on the part of the  international community.  </P> <P> "The fact that the foreign secretary of a superpower now visits Mr. De Klerk  can create a great deal of confusion, specifically that the Nationalist  government has done something which requires a change of attitude on the part  of the international community," he said. "We regard that as regrettable."  </P> <P> Baker responded that the Bush Administration approved his meeting with De Klerk  in order to show support for "efforts (that) are being made in good faith to  move the process forward in South Africa."  </P> <P> "We believe it's important to try and encourage that process to move forward,"  Baker added.  </P> <P> Despite this difference of opinion, Mandela and Baker both said they are in  complete agreement on the objective of replacing South Africa's official policy  of racial segregation with a non-racial democracy.  </P> <P> "I regard Mr. Baker, the American government, the Congress and the people of  America as true friends," said Mandela, deputy president of the African  National Congress, the chief anti-apartheid organization opposing De Klerk's  government.  </P> <P> A spirited diplomatic byplay preceded the half-hour Baker-Mandela meeting.  </P> <P> Although U.S. officials were confident that the meeting could be arranged when  both men were in Windhoek to attend Namibian independence ceremonies, the  African National Congress avoided setting the date until late Tuesday. The  agreement called for Mandela to call on Baker at the U.S. ambassador's  residence where the secretary of state was staying.  </P> <P> However, about five minutes before the scheduled 11:15 a.m. meeting, Mandela's  aides called the U.S. delegation to say that Mandela was running late and to  ask if Baker would mind coming to him. American aides, putting the best face on  the breach of diplomatic protocol, said Baker "gladly agreed."  </P> <P> When reporters arrived at Mandela's headquarters in a luxurious rented house a  few blocks from the official U.S. residence, they encountered Shevardnadze, who  was just leaving after his own audience with Mandela.  </P> <P> "It was a very good meeting," Shevardnadze said.  </P> <P> Shevardnadze also held an hourlong meeting with De Klerk, who was in Windhoek  to officially relinquish South African control of its former colony. De Klerk  had insisted on meeting Baker in Cape Town, but presumably agreed to confer  with Shevardnadze in Namibia because the Soviet official was unwilling to go to  South Africa.  </P> <P> As Baker arrived at Mandela's headquarters, the black leader said, "I'm very  sorry that we had to make this arrangement, but we have a tight schedule."  </P> <P> A senior State Department official later sought to focus attention on the  "atmosphere of friendship" that surrounded the meeting.  </P></p>

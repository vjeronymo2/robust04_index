			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Money Markets: New view on sterling IN RECENT weeks, sterling dealers have been bullish about the prospect for another cut in UK base rates, but the market finished 1992 in an uncertain mood, writes James Blitz. For the first half of the past week, dealers were convinced that another easing of monetary policy before the spring was certain. Reports of large numbers of people rushing to the shops to get end-of-year bargains suggested that the pressure might have come off the government to ease policy in order to stimulate the economy. So, too, did signs of increased business confidence in the last days of the year. The evidence, however, was ignored. The March short sterling contract peaked at 93.52 on Wednesday night. This suggested that three-month money in the spring will be as low as 6.48 per cent, a level compatible with 6 per cent base rates. Thursday saw a sharp reversal of sentiment in the futures market. In part, this was due to a feeling that the March contract had been oversold. One clearing bank dealer talked of how most of the buying on the floor of LIFFE over the Christmas period had been done by one broker. 'We have started to think that he may be talking the futures up too much,' he said. Another factor was a newspaper interview given to The Times by the UK chancellor of the exchequer, in which he appeared to rule out the possibility of base rate reductions. According to the text of the interview, the chancellor gave an emphatic 'no' in response to a question about whether there could be any expectation of a change in interest rates if the Treasury's forecast of a 1 per cent recovery next year became reality. The report of these remarks helped to push March short sterling down 10 basis points on New Year's Eve to a close of 93.42. However, the reversal in futures may not have been justified. Treasury officials pointed out on the day of publication of the interview that output and growth are not being targeted as the sole indicator of economic performance, as was implied. The Treasury says it will not judge the effect of its policies until they have worked through the economy. Other indicators, apart from growth, will also be watched.</p>

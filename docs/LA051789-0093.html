			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge John G. Penn in Washington signed an agreement that clears  the way for the first authorized human gene transfer and requires the National  Institutes of Health to open future decision-making on such experiments to the  public. The settlement came in a lawsuit filed Jan. 30 by the Foundation on  Economic Trends and its president, Jeremy Rifkin, that had challenged the first  planned introduction of a foreign gene into human beings, an experiment to be  conducted on 10 patients terminally ill with melanoma, a skin cancer. The suit  had said the NIH Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee approved the experiment  without conducting proper public hearings.  </P></p>

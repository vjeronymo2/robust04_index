			<p>BFN     [Text] A correspondent working in the north of Haiti  announced on 18 April the release of Le Borgne Mayor Belizaire  Fils-Aime, who was arrested in connection with the armed attack  against the police station there by armed individuals. The  situation is very tense in Le Borgne and the arrival of military  reinforcements coming from Cap-Haitien, Fort-Liberte, and even  Gonaives was noted. No one can provide explanations of what  actually happened because of the fear of the people living in Le  Borgne. This area is listed among the main areas of tenseness  since the events of 30 September 1991.</p>

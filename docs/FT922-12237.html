			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Survey of Seattle and Puget Sound (8): Gateway to the Northwest - Trade and tourism TRADE has always been part of Seattle's raison-d'etre. On a grey day in 1851, goes the story, a schooner headed for San Francisco stopped in the area and inquired about picking up timber. Thus, a port was born. Today, according to economists at Security Pacific Bank, Northwest ports handle more than Dollars 125bn of total annual trade volume. Not all of this, of course, feeds through the Seattle region: Portland tends to lead where grain and car shipments are concerned, and Vancouver is the obvious entry-exit point for Canada. Seattle and Tacoma, by contrast, have developed a strong presence in terms of containerised freight, while Sec-Tac Airport has a growing role in air-cargo trade. Statistics on movement and type of goods has been usefully compiled by the Trade Development Alliance of Greater Seattle. In terms of 1990 exports, it has estimated that companies based in King County exported almost Dollars 14.5bn worth of goods, while the state figure was Dollars 24.6bn. The largest single component was 'transportation equipment' - mainly aircraft and aircraft parts - underlining Boeing's dominant role in the region. This made up 79.5 per cent of King County exports, and was followed by services (ranging from accounting to real estate) with 8.8 per cent. After that came lumber products with 2.36 per cent, machinery with 1.5 per cent and then instruments, food, fishing, and electric, all at around 1 per cent. The five largest destination countries for all exports were (in descending order) Japan, Canada, the UK, Korea and Germany. For transportation products alone, this changes somewhat: the list becomes the UK, Japan, Germany, Australia, and China/Hong Kong. But look at trading partners on a two-way basis, and the picture changes again. For 'waterborne trade', which obviously slants the picture towards the Pacific Rim business but gives some indication of where the ports find their customers, the total value of Seattle's imports and exports in 1991 was Dollars 25.4bn. Nearly half of this - Dollars 12.2bn - related to Japan. Next, with 15 per cent, came Korea, and after that, Taiwan, China and Hong Kong. Add in air cargo, and total two-way trade for Seattle is put at Dollars 30bn. There are, of course, dozens of ports in the region - many privately operated - while, on the express package courier side, Seattle is home to Airborne Express. But there is no doubt that the two main players in Seattle-based trade are the Port of Seattle, which also runs Sea-Tac International Airport, and its neighbour to the south, the Port of Tacoma. The Port of Seattle is the larger operation. In 1991, for example, operating revenues are estimated to have been Dollars 148.6m, up by 2.1 per cent over the previous year in spite of the Gulf War repercussions. The Port of Tacoma, by contrast, saw revenues of Dollars 46.3m in 1990. However, this relative advantage was largely due to the Port of Seattle's aviation business. Its marine revenues were put at Dollars 46.6m last year, compared with Dollars 57.8m in 1990 - making it only a little larger than its southerly neighbour. In terms of container traffic, Seattle harbour is estimated to have handled 1.15m TEUs (20-foot equivalent units) last year. Tacoma's figure was nearer 1m, but is forecasting 1.1m for the present 12 months. This near-50:50 split for the area's container traffic is something of an achievement for Tacoma. Five years ago, its business was about two-thirds of Seattle's. Clearly, rivalry does exist, and upstart Tacoma has poached a number of former customers - such as Sealand - from its neighbour. Some locals attribute the shift in business to Seattle's complacency, and a somewhat bureaucratic environment. More objectively, one might note that Tacoma has considerable space advantages - aided considerably by a recent Indian land settlement. In spite of a recent lull in growth, the port is suggesting that it could see some 2.8m TEUs handled by 2010, and has drawn up a phased expansion plan on this assumption. Seattle, too, expects growth rates of a similar order, and has its own container terminal development plan. Meanwhile, the Port of Seattle's attempts to cajole its rival into more co-operation over pricing and other issues, appear to have fallen on stony ground. Tacoma officials remain diplomatic about the competition, but argue that, if business is not fought out between the two local ports, it could be lost to external rivals. Better that someone switches from Seattle to Tacoma, they claim, than from either of these ports to, say, LA-Long Beach. Where the Port of Seattle does take a clear leading role is in the development of air cargo. This has risen fairly sharply, from just 7,400 metric tons in 1986, to 20,000 metric tons by 1990. The growth in air freight overall, meanwhile, was marked during the mid-80s but has reduced more recently. In 1987, for example, domestic air freight increased by 21 per cent, and international by 30 per cent; in 1990, these rates were down to 7.1 and 13 per cent respectively. Tourism, meanwhile, ranks as the area's fourth largest industry - and one glance at the snow-covered mountains, abundant supply of outdoor activities in the state, and picturesque coastline makes it clear why. Some 530,000 international visitors are estimated to have passed through Seattle and King County in 1990, and total travel expenditures were put at Dollars 2.2bn. In local employment terms, this is plainly significant. More Over 43,000 full-time employees are reckoned to derive their livelihoods from the travel industry. Tourists also produced Dollars 88.7m of sales tax receipts and around Dollars 7m in local room taxes in 1990. The region is fairly well-served in terms of facilities. A new convention centre opened in the late-80s, although some argue that this is still too small. Meanwhile, there are more than over 7,000 hotel rooms in downtown Seattle, and some 20,000 or more in Seattle-King County. That, say locals, is about right at present - and the pricey room rates seem to back up this contention. There are, however, fears that if more capacity comes on stream  -as seems likely - a measure of oversupply could develop.</p>

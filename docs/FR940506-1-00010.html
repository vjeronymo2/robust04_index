			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Currently, Rules 10, 21, 32, and 45 (16 CFR 303.10, 303.21, 303.32, and 303.45) include provisions where measurements are expressed exclusively in inch/pound units. Under Executive Order 12770 of July 25, 1991 (56 FR 35801, July 29, 1991), and the Metric Conversion Act, as amended by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act (15 U.S.C. 205b), all federal agencies are required to use the SI metric system of measurement in all procurements, grants, and other business-related activities (which includes rulemakings), except to the extent that such use is impractical or is likely to cause significant inefficiencies or loss of markets to United States firms. To comply with these requirements, should the Commission elect to retain Rules 10, 21, 32, and 45 after conducting this review, the wording of these provisions will be altered to include the metric equivalents in parentheses beside the measurements in inch/pound units. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rule 10(b) (16 CFR 303.10(b)) would be revised to read: ``Where drapery or upholstery fabrics are manufactured on hand-operated looms for a particular customer after the sale of such fabric has been consummated, and the amount of the order does not exceed 100 yards (91.44 m) of fabric, the required fiber content disclosure may be made by listing the fibers present in order of predominance by weight with any fiber or fibers required to be designated as ``other fiber'' or ``other fibers'' appearing last, as for example: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> Rayon <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Wool <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Acetate <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Metallic <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other fibers'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 21(a)(1) (16 CFR 303.21(a)(1)) would be revised to read: ``If the samples, swatches, or specimens are less than two square inches (12.9 cm <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) in area and the information otherwise required to appear on the label is clearly, conspicuously, and non-deceptively disclosed on accompanying promotional matter in accordance with the Act and regulations;'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rule 32 (16 CFR 303.32) would be revised to read: ``Any upholstered product, mattress, or cushion which contains stuffing which has been previously used as stuffing in any other upholstered product, mattress, or cushion shall have securely attached thereto a substantial tag or label, at least 2 inches (5.08 cm) by 3 inches (7.62 cm) in size, and statements thereon conspicuously stamped or printed in the English language and in plain type not less than 1/3 inch (8.38 mm) high, indicating that the stuffing therein is composed in whole or in part of ``reused stuffing,'' ``secondhand stuffing,'' ``previously used stuffing,'' or ``used stuffing.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rule 45(a)(xv) (16 CFR 303.45(a)(xv)) would be revised to read: ``Flags with heading or more than 216 square inches (13.9 dm <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) in size;'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These are technical, non-substantive amendments to Rules 10, 21, 32, and 45 which merely provide metric equivalents to the measurements expressed in inch/pound units; they do not create any new requirements. Thus, under the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), no formal rulemaking proceeding is necessary to implement these revisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the Commission solicits public comments on the following questions: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.

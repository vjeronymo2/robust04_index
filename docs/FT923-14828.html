			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / Letter: Travel with article 8A Sir, It is not just 'litigious MEPs' who will be challenging the UK government if it maintains frontier controls with other EC states after January 1 next year ('Europe, the state of the union', July 1). I suspect that there will also be plenty of regular travellers between Britain and the continent who have been stopped and abused once too often by immigration and customs officials. I have had the pages of my diary and my cheque book stubs scrutinised enough times at Heathrow, Gatwick and Dover for it to be clear that such action is standard practice, and not a search based on any grounds of suspicion. Let's also not overlook that fact that if Britain does maintain controls, there is quite likely be an increase in the number of frontiers, because checks will have to be introduced between the Irish Republic and the UK, where none now exist. I will travel to England on January 1 1993 carrying, not a passport, but a copy of the Treaty of Rome, article 8A which states that there will be no internal frontiers after that date. Paul Fair, 10 Aborfield House, Islip Street, London NW5 3QW</p>

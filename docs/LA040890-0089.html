			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO ONE HAS FAINTEST IDEA WHAT TO DO;  </P> <P> SOCIAL PROBLEMS: THE REPUBLICANS LACK THE WILL TO SOLVE THEM, BUT DEMOCRATS  LACK THE WAY.  </P> <P> We are living in a time of unprecedented national consensus. The great  ideological arguments of the past -- over Russia, Vietnam, Nicaragua, the  welfare state, nuclear deterrence, etc.  </P> <P> -- are over. There are only two real issues on the American agenda. Debt: the  budget deficit and associated debt problems (e.g., the S&amp;L debacle). And  race: namely, the social problems (drugs, violence, poor schooling, family  break-up) of the urban underclass.  </P> <P> On debt, everybody knows what has to be done -- raise taxes and/or cut  entitlements -- but no one of either party has the courage to do it. On race,  the opposite is true: Everyone wants to do something but no one has the  faintest idea what to do. When the two great issues of the day are in a state  of paralysis, one for lack of will and one for lack of way, it is not  surprising that both government and opposition appear marginal.  </P> <P> In an era of ideological consensus, the parties naturally find themselves  engaged in narrow arguments over means. Everybody is for education, child care  and clean air. In the clean-air bill now being hammered out in Congress, the  fight is about a little less tailpipe emissions here, a little more high-sulfur  coal there. Important issues, but hardly galvanizing.  </P> <P> Which explains the attraction of would-be Democratic issues such as  protectionism, Social Security and demobilization. They all have the potential  to galvanize. It is therefore a critique of sorts to say that the Democrats as  a party are not hungry, not ruthless, not irresponsible enough to seize these  issues as a route to power.  </P> <P> But let's not confuse partisanship with statesmanship. Populism is fun and it  may be profitable. But it isn't vision.  </P></p>

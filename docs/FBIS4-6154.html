			<p>BFN     [Text] A NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN survey found that half of 10  major economists questioned said they believe the recession had  already hit bottom by March and that the current recession is  not the longest one since World War II. They noted that  individual consumption is picking up and that industrial output  increased in the two-month period starting in January 1994. On  the other hand, most of them termed the recent confusion on the  political scene and the appreciation of the yen as negative  factors for an economic recovery, adding that the economic  situation may become even worse after April if the enactment of  the fiscal year 1994 budget is drastically delayed.    NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN sent questionnaires to 10  private-sector  economists working with major research institutes and obtained  responses by 11 April.    The recession started in May 1991. If the Japanese economy  is still turned downward this April, the length of this  recession would rank with the nation's longest recession  following the second oil shock (36 months from March 1980 to  February 1983). However, 50 percent of the surveyed economists  said they disagree with the view that "the economy hit bottom  after April, and the recession will break the record of the 1980  recession."  <H5>  Optimists Pay Attention to Expanding Consumption </H5>   Among the five economists who answered that economic growth  has already begun, Yuji Shimanaka, Sanwa Research Institute  chief analyst, demonstrated the most optimistic view, saying  that the economic upturn started in October 1993. He noted that  some important economic indices, such as industrial output and  factory capacity rates, "reached turning points in October."  The other four economists who also said that the recession had  ended by March noted: 1) Positive moves are seen in individual  consumption; 2) public works spending and investment in housing  are at adequate levels; and 3) the private sector is promoting  business restructuring.    However, they said that upward movement of the economy is  still very weak and that the business sector's investment in  equipment will remain low until the end of this year. They  added that "economic recovery is unlikely to be evident in  business statistics in the first half of this year" (as noted by  Masao Yokomizo, Nikko Research Center deputy director general).  <H5>  Pessimists Focus on Yen Rate Hike, Overemployment </H5>   On the other hand, all five economists who said that the  recession is still continuing termed the appreciation of the yen  as the main reason for the delay in Japan's economic recovery.  Market trends have again been pushing up the yen rate since the  end of March, when the United States expressed dissatisfaction  with the Japanese Government's economic reform package. Masaru  Takagi, Fuji Research Institute chief analyst, said that "the  yen will strengthen if the political turmoil is prolonged and  Japan fails to work out tangible measures for expanding the  domestic market by the time of the Group of Seven summit." He  said in that case, favorable trends in some export industries  would not result in a full-fledged economic recovery.    Director Yoshikazu Takao of the Nomura Research Institute  Economic Research Department noted that "the business sector is  still troubled by overemployment, and this will delay an upturn  in business profits." As for the recent recovery in individual  consumption, Koichi Masugata, Nissei Research Institute deputy  chief analyst, said that "a consumer-led economic recovery is  unlikely because an increase in income has not yet been observed  among consumers."  <H5>  Impact of Political Turmoil </H5>   Most respondents, including those who answered that the  recession had already hit bottom, said that political turmoil  since Prime Minister Hosokawa's announcement of his resignation  is a "negative factor for an economic recovery." Yukio Yamaya,  managing director of the Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Research  Institute, stated that he "may have to revise his view that the  bottom of the recession occurred in the last quarter of 1993" if  the enactment of the fiscal year 1994 budget is drastically  delayed by confusion in selection of Hosokawa's successor. A  political vacuum cools down the economic actions of the business  sector and individual consumers, and the delay in budget  deliberations may temporarily stop the enactment of public work  projects.    However, the Sanwa Research Institute's Shimanaka said that  "upward movement is being observed in economic trends, and  confusion on the political scene will not fully affect the  economy."</p>

			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Economic Diary: Other economic news Monday: As markets digest the implications of the G7 policy meeting last weekend, a spate of inflation data will be issued this week. In the UK, the June producer price index will be scrutinised for any sign that rising commodity prices and industrial growth are raising prices. Input prices are expected to increase slightly on the month, but to remain below last year's levels. In Germany, May's retail sales data, issued early this week, may point to a small annual improvement in spending, but consumer confidence remains fragile. Tuesday: With the markets now predicting that the US will be at the forefront of any pick-up in world inflation, June's consumer price index will be watched with interest. It is expected to to show a small monthly rise. Friday: June wholesale prices indices for Japan and Germany are due at the end of the week. The German index may have risen slightly on the month; the Japanese one is expected to be flat. May's industrial production data are likely to provide further indication that the sharp downturn in Japanese manufacturing last year is now bottoming out.</p>

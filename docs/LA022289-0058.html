			<p><P> February 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ITALIAN LEADER TO LOSE PARTY POST, PERILING COALITION  </P> <P> Against a backdrop of lofty rhetoric and savage infighting, Italy's largest  political party is in the throes of a leadership change that could mean an  early death for the coalition government led by Prime Minister Ciriaco De Mita.  </P> <P> Delegates to a congress of the Christian Democratic Party, which has been  Italy's party of government for four decades, will vote today to replace De  Mita as party secretary and leader.  </P> <P> Arnaldo Forlani, the elegant, 63-year-old former prime minister, is the party's  choice to succeed De Mita. Forlani, who has a reputation as a cautious and  patient mediator, represents the conservative wing of the party, whose members  range from moderate leftists to traditionalist Roman Catholics.  </P> <P> When De Mita became prime minister last April, he argued that holding that post  and the party leadership simultaneously would lend stability and efficiency to  his reform effort. However, the Christian Democrats, who have served in every  one of Italy's 47 postwar governments, have preferred that the party leader not  be prime minister; they believe this arrangement reduces the room for political  maneuvering.  </P> <P> In fact, De Mita's five-party coalition has proven to be weak, unable to remedy  such problems as a growing national deficit and poor public services; nor has  there been any sign of the long-promised party renovation.  </P> <P> De Mita, a polished tactician and scarred political realist, came to his  party's 18th congress over the weekend ready to relinquish the party post he  has held since 1982. Still, he hoped to see his own candidate, legislator Mino  Martinazzoli, elected to replace him, thereby keeping command within the  party's left wing.  </P> <P> Instead, Forlani's candidacy was forced on De Mita by Forlani's centrists, by  defectors from his own faction and by the party's right wing, led by Foreign  Minister Giulio Andreotti.  </P> <P> In voting tonight, the congress may elect De Mita to replace Forlani as party  president -- a sinecure -- but even that would not restore the prime minister's  lost political authority.  </P> <P> It is not clear how much power De Mita, shorn of his party post, will be able  to exert in government over the shifting factions of his party or centrist  coalition partners, who are disgruntled at what they consider his inflationary  surrender to labor union demands last month.  </P> <P> After 10 months in an office he has said he hopes to hold from two to four  years, De Mita has achieved only one successful reform: abolition of the secret  vote in Parliament, which had enabled maverick coalition legislators to  undercut government legislation with impunity.  </P> <P> The aftermath of the congress may nudge the Christian Democrats away from any  possible De Mita-fashioned alliances with Italy's Communists and closer to  their Socialist government partners. "We offer the Socalists solid ground, not  quicksand," Forlani told the congress.  </P> <P> The bespectacled, silver-haired Forlani is seen as a unifying figure within the  party.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW FACES AND NEW IDEAS ON WATER BOARDS;  </P> <P> POLLUTION: FIVE ENVIRONMENTALISTS ELECTED IN NOVEMBER MAY HAVE DIFFERENT  SOLUTIONS TO GROUND-WATER PROBLEMS. A RIPPLE EFFECT MAY CAUSE CHANGES IN OTHER  AGENCIES.  </P> <P> Last November, when five environmentalists won elections in three key San  Gabriel Valley water districts, Hacienda Heights environmentalist Wil Baca  predicted, "you're going to see wholesale changes in January."  </P> <P> During the campaign, the environmentalists advocated a more aggressive approach  to remedying the region's ground-water pollution, one of the worst problems of  its kind in the West.  </P> <P> Now, as the five winners -- three newcomers and the two incumbents -- prepare  to begin their new terms next month, early signs indicate changes will indeed  take place, potentially shaking up water boards from El Monte to Claremont.  </P> <P> A ripple effect also will likely occur on other water agencies where the  defeated incumbents, as well as some officials who were not up for reelection,  have served in appointed posts, owing to their membership on the key water  boards -- the San Gabriel Valley Municipal Water District, the Three Valleys  Municipal Water District and the Upper San Gabriel Valley Municipal Water  District.  </P> <P> The new environmental influence in those districts -- which focus on providing  adequate water supplies to their customers -- could result in significant  changes in the appointments to these other water agencies.  </P> <P> The defeat of Donald F. Clark by Carol Montano for the Azusa seat on the San  Gabriel District provides an example of the type of change that is expected.  </P> <P> A longtime water official, Clark was chairman of the San Gabriel district. He  also served as president of the newly created water-quality authority that was  set up to help deal with severe ground-water pollution that plagues the San  Gabriel Valley. In addition, he represented his board on another local water  agency, the Main San Gabriel Basin Watermaster.  </P> <P> His defeat not only opened up the presidency of the San Gabriel district, but  created vacancies on the two other important boards.  </P> <P> Even incumbents still in office are threatened with a loss of power as the  boards during the next month reorganize, elect new officers and make their  appointments to regional water agencies.  </P> <P> Influencing their boards' discussions on new appointments and officers, members  of the three San Gabriel water districts say, will be the November victories of  the environmentalists, as well as determining how the individual boards decide  the water cleanup efforts in their areas should be handled.  </P> <P> Witness the case of Burton E. Jones of the Upper District, where two  environmentalists -- Marvin Joe Cichy and Anthony Fellow, both of El Monte --  defeated incumbents identified as favoring the water industry viewpoint.  </P> <P> A 20-year member of the board and a longtime representative in the Southern  California water Establishment, Jones won't be up for reelection for two years.  But, because of environmentalists now making up a majority on his board, he  faces a potential loss of several powerful positions, including presidency of  the Upper District, vice chairmanships on both the Metropolitan Water District  of Southern California and the regional water quality authority, and his  membership on the Watermaster board, which oversees water rights and pumping in  the San Gabriel Basin.  </P> <P> Jones, of South Pasadena, and others on his board say he may lose several of  the key posts because his colleagues don't see him as an environmentalist and  won't reappoint him.  </P> <P> "It's very possible," Jones said. "I hope I've lived long enough to understand  that's politics. But water has become a highly political thing. Everyone that  turns on a faucet is now an expert."  </P> <P> Local water agencies during the last year have grappled with the fact that no  single governmental agency has the overall authority to finance and supervise  the pollution cleanup. Environmentalists have favored the legislative creation  of a regional "super-agency."  </P> <P> But many local water officials have believed this was unnecessary, saying the  San Gabriel Valley's new water-quality authority can be given the necessary  powers to do the job, along with the Watermaster.  </P> <P> Environmentalists have called for water officials to involve the public more in  the decision-making process of alleviating the ground-water problem, estimated  to cost hundreds of millions of dollars and to take decades to solve.  </P> <P> Established water officials, who have been criticized for paying more attention  to interests of water companies than to consumers, and environmentalists all  say they hope for a spirit of compromise to prevail as they go about their  tasks in the coming months.  </P> <P> "I'm optimistic," said Robert G. Berlien, who wears two hats as executive  officer of both the Upper District and the Watermaster. "But I'll grant you the  possibility that (the two factions) can't get along.  </P> <P> "You have the old-time water Establishment in conflict with the new-line  environmentalist, public activist groups. Whether they can reach an accord, I  don't know. It's not going to be easy."  </P> <P> Upper District member Bill Robinson, who joined the board two years ago when he  defeated a San Gabriel Valley water Establishment icon, Howard Hawkins -- once  chairman of the powerful Metropolitan Water District -- said he is hopeful for  a new era in which the concerns of the environmentalists have more impact on  policy. "We have a great opportunity to make some real progress," he said.  </P> <P> Paul Stiglich, one of the Three Valleys incumbents who was reelected with  support from environmentalist groups, said he expects some changes within his  board and the appointments it will make next month. Likewise, he said, he also  expects perhaps even more environmentalist-inspired changes on the water  quality authority.  </P> <P> "It depends on how much certain people want to rock the boat," he said. "But I  think it's going to happen."  </P> <P> Reflecting the criticism made by water Establishment members who are skeptical  of changes advocated by environmentalists, Marvin Cichy of the Upper District  acknowledged that he and his environmental colleagues have much to learn.  </P> <P> "But my position is similar to when I served on the Rosemead City Council,"  Cichy said. "We always said of new council members: 'Give them a year, and  you'll know whether they'll be good or not.' "  </P></p>

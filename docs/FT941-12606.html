			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Romania strike backs reforms Romania's trade unions said last night more than 1m workers took part in yesterday's one-hour warning strike, the biggest union action since the end of communist rule in 1989, writes Virginia Marsh in Bucharest. Alfa Cartel, CNSLR-Fratia and the National Union Bloc, which together represent more than 5m workers, half the workforce, said they would launch one-day warning strikes in the next 10 days, to be followed by a general strike, if their demands for faster economic reforms, higher wages and a better social security system were not met. The high turn-out and threat of further action will increase pressure on the ruling Party of Social Democracy in Romania, which this week began new negotiations for a governing coalition with former communist and hardline nationalist parties. The three union blocs have said they will only support a government which includes pro-reform opposition parties.</p>

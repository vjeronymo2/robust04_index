			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Finance Minister Rudolf Filkus by Stanislav </F> Drahny and Robert Casensky; place and date not given: "The Old  Bloc Must Be Abolished No Later Than 1 May"]    [Text] Rudolf Filkus, the former HZDS economics expert,  has become Slovak finance minister and deputy prime minister  responsible for economic development. He granted our paper an  interview on the economic objectives of Moravcik's new Cabinet  and the prospects of economic relations between Slovakia and the  Czech Republic.    [DENNI TELEGRAF] In what way will you improve the difficult  economic situation in Slovakia?    [Filkus] Every government has some limits. Our limits are  determined by the time remaining until the early elections. We  have to adopt this viewpoint when speaking about what the  government can do and what it believes to be its main task. In  my opinion, the government's main task is the political and  economic stabilization of this country. We have to send signals  abroad describing the extent to which the situation has  stabilized. This is important in terms of the influx of foreign  capital into the country. Of course, it is also important in  terms of the domestic economy. There are no miraculous cures  that would help us to do something great, if for no other reason  than that our time span is limited. We have to take this factor  into consideration.    [DENNI TELEGRAF] Are you considering a devaluation of the  Slovak koruna, a devaluation that would strengthen the  export-stimulating policy, or are you going to orient yourselves  toward protective measures, such as import certificates, for  instance?    [Filkus] First, I have to say that the finance minister  should not have a say in devaluation. We are giving an  opportunity here to those who are in charge of monetary  policy--that is, the Central Bank. This bank is responsible for  monetary stability and is entitled to decide, while taking  economic criteria into account, whether to devalue or not. Of  course, the bank governor can come to see the minister and ask  him what he should do to improve the situation in the state  budget, to decrease the pressure of the inflationary spiral,  etc. I want to say that our people strongly believe,  unfortunately, that the finance minister should decide whether  to devalue. I repeat, this is a matter to be decided  exclusively by the National Bank.    [DENNI TELEGRAF] Devaluation can be replaced by an import  surcharge. However, this is an inefficient measure. Are you  going to maintain it?    [Filkus] The protection of the market is a normal economic  tool. I consider the surcharge that we have introduced to be a  good economic measure because it can, at least theoretically,  protect the market. At the same time, however, it is necessary  to implement subsequent systemic measures not only to protect  the domestic market, but also to help develop a proexport  policy. I expected, for example, that import surcharge,  particularly on food products from the Czech Republic, would  help us to "clean" the market. The empty space thus created  would be filled by our producers, which is usual in normally  functioning economies. Unfortunately, this is not what is  happening. On the contrary, prices went up following the  introduction of the import surcharge.    [DENNI TELEGRAF] What will happen to the "quality control"  of Czech food then?    [Filkus] On Monday [21 March], we discussed with Minister  Kocarnik three open issues. They are food certificates, the  customs union, and two clearing blocs [clearingovy blok]. As  regards the certificates, you certainly know that an agreement,  which is valid until the end of March, provides for mutual  recognition of the Czech and Slovak certificates. This should  change as of 1 April. I consider it to be a positive step by  the Slovak side that we spoke openly about those problems. The  validity of the certificates will not be abolished on 31 March  but will be extended for at least one month. In this way, we  will avoid the situation that recently arose on the Czech-Slovak  borders.    [DENNI TELEGRAF] People are saying that similar duty should  be imposed on consumer goods. Can you confirm this?    [Filkus] This is a matter to be decided in the future. Why  should the quality of some products not be tested? I am of the  opinion that this problem is different from the problems in  trading relations with other countries. For many products, we  have the same technology as the Czech Republic, the same  standards, and the same quality. I do not see a large problem  here.    [DENNI TELEGRAF] The so-called clearing account plays an  important role in Czech-Slovak relations. Slovakia has a large  deficit on this account. Are you going to try to eliminate the  old clearing bloc?    [Filkus] This is very serious business. The old bloc has  become a subject of various speculations, and many entrepreneurs  have made money to the detriment of the state. I do not believe  that this is an honest business. By antedating their claims,  entrepreneurs made a profit based on the fact that they were  sending money through the old bloc and receiving it from the new  one. At present, this problem has accumulated, and debt has  exceeded the limit of 130 million European Currency Units. The  state had to pay it using not the old exchange rate but the  current one. The state had to suffer a loss that is  proportionate to the profit the speculators made on the clearing  account. Because of this, the old bloc should be abolished as  soon as possible--no later than 1 May.    Of course, it will depend on both sides whether this bloc  will be abolished. According to preliminary consultations, both  sides are in favor of abolishing the old clearing bloc as soon  as possible.    [DENNI TELEGRAF] You said that several cases of fraud have  been mentioned in connection with the old bloc. Do you believe  they could be explained retrospectively?    [Filkus] I do not believe that is possible.    [DENNI TELEGRAF] Will there be a second wave of coupon  privatization in Slovakia?    [Filkus] Certainly. The fact that the privatization  process, which is an important economic accomplishment, has  become a tool for concentrating power makes us accelerate the  privatization process, depoliticize it, and make it more  understandable. In the fall, we want to prepare the second wave  of coupon privatization.    I believe that all of the privatization methods are equal.  Coupon privatization is the fastest. We have promised our  people: We are going to give you back a part of the property  you lost in wages. Privatization has an ethical aspect, too.</p>

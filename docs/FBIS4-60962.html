			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Yarushin] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 1 May -- This morning, the apparatus of  Presidents Askar Akayev and Islam Karimov confirmed to an  ITAR-TASS correspondent that the heads of state of Kirghizia  [Kyrgyzstan], Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan held a meeting on 29-30  April in the town of Karakol on the shore of Lake Issyk-Kul in  Kyrgyzstan. The apparatus categorically refused to give details  of the meeting, saying it was of a confidential nature.  However, it was learned in a telephone conversation with a  representative of Karimov's administration that a communique was  signed on the results of the meeting.    ITAR-TASS has learned that the meeting in Karakol was  devoted  to the problems of creating an effective mechanism for a single  economic zone in the region. Observers are expressing the  supposition that they were discussing the possibility of a  regional transformation of the idea of creating a Eurasian  union. We remind you that in Moscow on 29 March Nursultan  Nazarbayev proposed the creation of a new association of CIS  member states -- a Eurasian union. At that time he said that if  the idea did not find sufficient support in the CIS, a Eurasian  union could be joined by individual states.    Nazarbayev's idea of a Eurasian union of states proposes the  formation of supranational bodies to coordinate economic,  defense, and foreign policy; the formation of a single  parliament and councils of defense and foreign ministers; and  the introduction of common citizenship.    The idea of creating a Eurasian union met with a restrained  reaction from leaders of CIS member countries. They described  it as interesting, but premature. Therefore, one can suppose  with some confidence that on the shore of Lake Issyk-Kul the  presidents of Kirghizia, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan jointly  launched an "integration offensive" within the framework of  bringing regional interests closer together.</p>

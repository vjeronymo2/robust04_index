			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] East Timor has not been forgotten by the 21  Ibero-American countries. The situation in the territory will  be included in the final communique of the Colombian summit.    In Cartagena de Indias the Portuguese representatives  expressed an interest in greater cooperation with Latin America.  Among all the speeches there was harsh criticism of Cuba and  Fidel Castro from Argentina and Venezuela. Our correspondent  Antonio Prata reports.    [Begin recording] [Prata] [passage omitted] Despite the  friendly hug between Fidel Castro and Portuguese Foreign  Minister Durao Barroso, President Mario Soares and Prime  Minister Cavaco Silva did not forget the situation on the  island. For Soares, without a strong democracy there will be no  development in Latin America.    [Soares] In order for the legitimate aspirations and  expectations of the people to materialize, it is necessary for  democracy to rest on solid foundations, giving rise to a  balanced and equatable economic, social, and cultural  development.    [Prata] A future which already includes trade development  and  an open process of regional integration--a phenomenon praised by  Cavaco Silva:    [Silva] Therefore, I welcome the fact that the documents of  this conference advocate the principle of open regionalism which  adequately represents the different processes under way in  Europe and in Latin America in the area of economic integration.    [Prata] Durao Barroso also advocated this cooperation  between  blocs.    [Barroso] In this modern world, which some believe is moving  toward a concept of blocs, it is important to maintain these  links between different blocs or different groups, and to this  effect Portugal, as well as Spain, has been a link between  Europe and, in this case, Latin America.    [Prata] [passage omitted] It seems certain that Portugal  will  host the 1998 summit, probably in Oporto. [end recording]</p>

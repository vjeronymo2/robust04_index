			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Series of surrenders for Amato - The government has survived an unprecedented battering CRISIS has lent a cruel touch to Italy's cartoonists. One of the most acerbic has Prof Giuliano Amato, the prime minister, and his three economic ministers dressed in military uniform with their hands raised beside a white flag and a burning of pile of lire. For the 2 1/2 -month-old Amato government, the events of the past few days have been a continual series of surrenders to the overwhelming pressures on the lira. The latest was the decision yesterday morning to let the lira float at least until Monday. Only 12 hours earlier the Bank of Italy denied any such move was contemplated. On the surface, no post-war Italian government has ever been so battered and tossed by fast-moving events. Indeed, by the short-lived standards of the previous 50 governments, it is remarkable that such a weak four-party coalition has survived so far. With a parliament still smarting from his surprise decision the previous Wednesday to seek emergency powers to deal with the economic and financial crisis, Prof Amato was roundly criticised for presenting the weekend 7 per cent devaluation of the lira in overly optimistic terms. Members of his own Socialist party were sniping at him, and his relations with the Bank of Italy, the one institution which has sought to keep its head above the fray, were strained by arguments over how to defend the lira. His resolve was certainly stiffened by a meeting with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, whose clear support for the prime minister has become an important factor. Mr Scalfaro, in his brief period of office, has established considerable authority which few politicians or parties are likely to challenge lightly. Equally, the prospect in such turbulent circumstances of a political vacuum, no matter how brief, seems to have concentrated the minds of politicians. Prof Amato has been able to exploit this as a desperate but ultimately powerful card to sustain his government. His departure would profoundly damage Italy's international credibility and confirm market scepticism that the country is incapable of providing stable governments. Moreover, Prof Amato has said on several occasions that a new government would merely face the same set of problems, and almost certainly have to adopt similar policies. Whatever the outcome of the French referendum on Maastricht on Sunday and short-term developments in the Exchange Rate Mechanism, Italy will still face external pressure to tackle its disastrous public finances and reduce the public-sector deficit. This is set to shoot beyond 11 per cent of GDP next year without tough remedial action. Thus the precise composition of an Italian government becomes irrelevant if policies are being forced upon it from outside, especially by the markets. But there are practical internal considerations which militate against a change of government now. A new government would first have to look to the narrow 16-seat majority provided by the present coalition of Christian Democrats, Socialists, Social Democrats and Liberals. Alternatively, there would be an attempt to establish new alliances, perhaps across party lines, with a break in the existing structure of both the Socialists and Christian Democrats. Inevitably, this would be time-consuming and probably accelerate fresh elections - and none of the big parties is in fit shape to go to the country. They have no money and are split internally, with the exception of the emergent Lombard League. Their leaderships are discredited in the public's eye both for clinging to power, and as a result of the Milan corruption scandal and the awesome extent of the abuse of power exposed. Now the public is blaming them for blithely ignoring Italy's problems for decades and producing the present mess. At last the politicians are showing signs they can no longer ignore this huge ground-swell of discontent over their incompetence and excessive privileges, treating the state as their personal war chest. This week parliament rescinded plans to award its members an extra L750,000 (Pounds 335) a month in allowances and refused the pay rises of as high as L62m a year, backdated to 1991, granted by the Andreotti government to the heads of state companies. Prof Amato has garnered considerable public support by presenting his as a technocratic government trying to tackle long-ignored problems. He may not obtain from parliament the emergency powers he wants to take economic decisions without resort to long parliamentary procedures. But he looks set to have parliament's endorsement for fundamental reforms of four areas eating away at the budget - pensions, public health, the civil service and regional administration. The government faces two immediate issues. The first concerns the 1993 budget and the extent to which efforts to find nearly L100,000bn to hold down the deficit convince the markets - which may be in the mood to feel that nothing is enough. The second centres on the impact of the devaluation and floating of the lira. Its fall to a more realistic level - an effective devaluation of at least 15 per cent against the D-Mark, economists argue - could make up for the inadequacy of Monday's 7 per cent realignment. But equally, such a fall might have a greater inflationary impact, despite the domestic recession, than the government can control. A central pillar of government policy in holding down prices is a tripartite agreement with the unions and employers. An outline deal reached in July de-indexing wages now looks fragile - especially if the unions judge the government unable either to keep inflation below 5 per cent or to introduce measures which ensure the sacrifices will be borne equally by everyone. Beyond this, the reactions of ordinary Italians are hard to predict. They have seen the wealthy scramble to get their money out of the country while they themselves are only just beginning to realise the scale of the crisis engulfing Italy. But soon there will be higher taxes, more unemployment and the soft living standards, taken from granted after decades of growth, will be eroded.</p>

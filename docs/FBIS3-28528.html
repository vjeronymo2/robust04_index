"We had a very good two-day visit here because we were given  opportunities to call on Premier Vo Van Kiet and Party  Secretary-General Do Muoi and the delegates, after talking with  other Vietnamese high ranking officials, were now able to attain  Vietnam's policies and govemment leaders' views so that they  could plan their future investment in Vietnam," said Anan in an  interview with THE NATION before leaving Hanoi Friday for Ho Chi  Minh City, the second leg of his working visit to Vietnam.    Anan led a delegation comprising 20 top Thai businessmen on  a  five-day working visit to Vietnam at the invitation of  Vietnamese Premier Vo Van Kiet. The visit was described by both  the hosts and the guest as "a returning home." "For the  Vietnamese, you have been our friend for years. You have been  making every effort to establish good Thai-Vietnamese ties.  Therefore in our view, your trip to Vietnam this time could be  seen as a returning home," said Dau Ngoc Xuan, chairman of the  State Committee for Cooperation and Investment at a reception  given shortly afer Anan's arrival.    The respect given to Anan by the Vietnamese even sounds  better when Vietnamese Premier praised his guest as Vietnam's  good and trusted friend. "Your visit will surely usher in a new  era, that of a multi-faceted cooperation between our two  countries," Kiet said at a reception given to Anan last  Wednesday [2 February]. "We should join our efforts on  accelerating the Thai-Vietnamese ties regardless of whatever the  past was," Kiet added.    In turn, Anan said he shared the Vietnamese leaders' views.  "I'll do everything I can to accelerate and cement  Thai-Vietnamese ties," he added. Anan also said during his long  talks with Kiet at a small private dinner given in his honour by  the Vietnamese premier, the host and the guest had talked quite  a bit about political and economic ties between Vietnam and  Thailand.    "We all expressed our satisfaction at the development of the  ties between our two countries," said Anan, adding that he was  quite satisfied with his trip.    Asked if there was any contact signed during the trip, the  former premier said three memorandums of understanding would be  signed in Ho Chi Minh city. According to them, a zippers and  buttons factory would be set up by Saha Union and there would be  technical cooperation between Pranda Jewellery (of Thailand) and  Saigon Jewellery.    Asked to comment on the decision recently taken by the  United  States to lift the trade embargo against Vietnam the former  premier said,"it's good for the United States. It's good for  Vietnam. It's good for the region. The move helps everybody put  the Vietnam War behind them. We all look forward to expanding  ties between the countries, between the United States and  Vietnam," he said.

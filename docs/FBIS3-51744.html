			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Havana, 17 Jan (PL) -- The weekly TRABAJADORES  affirmed today that life iteself makes readjustments necessary,  but, it adds, we will make them the socialist way, the Cuban  way. The weekly also reported the possibility of an economic  recovery in the country in 1994.    In an editorial dedicated to what it calls "parliaments in  the workplace" (general assemblies dedicated to discussing  current economic difficulties and their eventual solutions), the  official mouthpiece of the Central Organization of Cuban Trade  Unions [CTC] notes that usually during debates workers note that  it is necessary for each organization to adopt its own measures  in the search for efficiency.    The weekly adds: We have no other reasonable road but to  reduce costs, to increase labor productivity, and to get as much  as possible from the available resources. The weekly warns that  a high degree of labor discipline is a matter of attitude,  awareness of social duties, and patriotism.    TRABAJADORES reports that economic policy proposals unleash  real or imaginary conflicts of interests and contrary opinions.  In illustrating this assertion, the weekly notes that  suggestions for higher prices prompt concern for people who live  on relatively low salaries.    The weekly adds: If somebody speaks in favor of subsidizing  low-income people but not the goods now being sold at prices  below production costs, some people will point to how complex  this kind of compensatory mechanism is.    The weekly notes that one of the main concerns of the  workers  is crime, its relationship with the black market, and the effect  this has on social and labor discipline.    The weekly wonders about an eventual solution and then  states  that people at all levels demand that drastic and examplary  measures be applied to resolve the problems of theft and the  diversion of goods, which increases costs, demoralizes the  community, and makes rich the so-called "macetas" (traffickers,  speculators, etc.).    The weekly links all this to the need for strict compliance  with financial norms. It also mentions the need to modify the  tax system, possibly expanding it.    The weekly reports: Signs of economic recovery in some  production sectors and activities are expected in 1994, and this  includes rationalizing finances based on an lofty political  consensus.    TRABAJADORES reports that the Cuban people are moving onto a  more offensive phase in key aspects of the struggle to safeguard  the fatherland's sovereignty and the socialist nature of the  revolution.    The weekly admits that the complexity of the problems shows  how naive it would be to expect magic-like measures. It goes on  to discard "packages" that "smell too much like Third-World  capitalism and neoliberal policies," which would prompt higher  prices, unemployment, and the elimination of social services.    We are in urgent need of improving our economic efficiency,  but we must not run full speed ahead to secure technical  objectives without first considering political effects, the  weekly states.    TRABAJADORES calls for not allowing the slightiest  indication  of ritualism or formalism in the parliaments in the workplace,  and it states that it is essential that managers throughout the  country clearly report the economic and financial outlook of  each workplace.</p>

			<p><P> January 9, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Continental Cuts Fares Again: Continental Airlines, which last week raised  fares by 4%, said it would offer one-way tickets to and from Texas cities for  as low as $9 to fill seats that otherwise would be empty. "It's a whole lot  more productive to put somebody in a seat at $9 or $19 than to have that seat  go empty," said John Nelson, Continental's executive vice president of  marketing. The new fares, dubbed "TexSavers," are good for travel between all  Texas cities Continental serves, except El Paso, and for travel between Houston  and New Orleans, Oklahoma City and Tulsa.  </P></p>

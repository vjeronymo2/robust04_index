			<p>BFN     [Text] Brigadier General Syarwan Hamid, Chief of ABRI's  [Indonesian Armed Forces] Information Center, told newsmen in  Jakarta today that ABRI shares the opinion of the Indonesian  Foreign Department in regretting the plan by Malaysian  Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO's) to conduct a forum on  East Timor.    He said that if the forum in Malaysia is allowed to proceed,  the solidarity and good relations between Indonesia and Malaysia  will be negatively affected.    The Indonesian Government hopes that the Malaysian  Government  will adopt the same attitude as that of the Philippine  Government, whereby a planned forum on East Timor was canceled.    The ABRI Information Center chief feels that the forum to be  held in Malaysia can tarnish the good reputation of the  Indonesian Government, particularly the ABRI.</p>

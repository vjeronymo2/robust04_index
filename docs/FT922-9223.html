			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Pigging out at the Cafe Royal THE Cafe Royal in London became a pig pen yesterday. It was the venue for the National Pig Development Company to show off its new Anglo-Chinese hybrid, the Manor Meishan. Lord Plumb, Conservative MEP for The Cotswolds and former president of the National Farmers' Union, described the hybrid as a 'quantum leap in pig breeding'. It combines the astonishing reproductive performance of the Meishan  - each sow has 16 piglets a litter and produces two or three litters a year  - with the lean meat characteristic of the British Large White and Landrace breeds. China sold 32 of its fat, wrinkly Meishan pigs in 1987 to a consortium of British pig breeding companies for use in a research programme co-ordinated by the Institute of Animal Physiology and Genetics Research in Edinburgh. The Manor Meishan is the first commercial result. It looks smooth and sleek, without the heavy folds of skin characteristic of its Chinese ancestors. Like them, it has 16 teats  - and sometimes even 18  - to accommodate its large litters (a typical European pig has 12). National Pig Development, a private company based at Driffield, Humberside, will supply Manor Meishans 'exclusively to the UK market for the foreseeable future'. The company expects to deliver 2,000 pigs in the next year. Lord Plumb welcomed the 'cost-cutting' hybrid as a development that would help British farmers compete.</p>

			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Brussels may probe travel groups Independent tour operators and travel agents are to ask the European Commission to investigate the dominant position of large travel groups. The decision to approach the Commission follows last week's announcement by the Office of Fair Trading that it had cleared the large travel groups of anti-competitive practices. The submission to the Commission will be made by the Association of Independent Tour Operators and the Alliance of Independent Travel Agents. Mr Colin Heal, chairman of the alliance, said the position of small travel companies had worsened since the OFT began its inquiry 14 months ago. Airtours, the second largest tour operator, had, by acquiring other travel agents, developed Going Places, the second-largest retail chain. The three largest travel agents' chains also launched a price-cutting campaign earlier this month, offering discounts of up to 15 per cent. Smaller travel agents say they find it difficult to match these offers as the standard rate of commission is only 10 per cent. Mr Heal said his organisation had approached competition policy officials at the Commission several weeks ago, before the OFT announcement. Meanwhile, the large travel agents yesterday began to reduce the level of discounts on offer. Thomas Cook said it had decided to reduce its top discount on summer 1995 holidays to 12 per cent. The chain, the third-largest, had for two weeks been offering discounts of up to 15 per cent. Going Places said it had also reduced its top discount to 12 per cent. Lunn Poly, the largest travel retail chain, said it would make an announcement today. Mr Peter Shanks, Thomas Cook's commercial director, said: 'The 15 per cent discounts were never going to be sustainable . . . For travel agents it just did not make commercial sense.' The 15 per cent discounts appear to have achieved their objective of persuading holidaymakers to book early. About 500,000 holidays for summer 1995 have been sold so far. Airtours, which issued its summer 1995 brochures first, is believed to have made a good start against Thomson, the largest tour operator. Owners Abroad, which this week said it was changing its name to First Choice, is believed to have lost market share through its failure to publish its brochures at the same time as its rivals.</p>

			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / London Bullion Market (1): Havens of inertia - Most gold production is at record levels but producers and bullion dealers are feeling the pinch. At today's prices half the world's gold mining capacity is unprofitable and investors remain disenchanted IN some respects the world of gold has never been more dynamic. Production in countries outside the former Soviet Union is at record levels. More gold is being bought by jewellery makers, gold's main customers. In each of the past four years jewellery fabricators have consumed more gold than was produced by all the gold mines outside the former communist countries. They also helped to absorb a great deal from other sources such as imports from Russia, disposals by central banks and scrap material. Jewellers' appetite for gold was whetted because it has been looking such a bargain. Gold has recently been at its lowest point for six years when measured in dollars. Valued in Swiss francs, the metal has been at its lowest since 1978. In yen, it has been at a 20-year low. From the peak of Dollars 800 a troy ounce in 1980, reached after Soviet forces invaded Afghanistan and the US froze Iran's assets, gold has fallen steadily and dropped below Dollars 340 this year. Some consumers welcome this trend but producers and bullion dealers are feeling the pinch. On the production front, about half the world's gold mining capacity is unprofitable at today's prices. Most of the uneconomic mines are in South Africa, where large workforces dig to depths of up to 2 1/2 miles (4km) to extract the metal from narrow seams. The steady fall in the gold price has left investors disenchanted. In particular, many North American and European investors have quit the gold market in the past few years, relying instead on a vast array of new financial instruments to protect their wealth. This trend is having a deleterious impact on bullion markets. One analyst aptly describes them as havens of inertia. Yet even in depressed circumstances they play a vital role in the world of gold. In Europe, North America and parts of Asia gold trading is a highly sophisticated business. Gold is traded round the clock by the most powerful financial institutions in the world. It is often said that gold bullion trading follows the sun, begining the day in Sydney and then on to Hong Kong and Singapore. It moves west as the markets open in Switzerland and London and then crosses the Atlantic to the New York market and the futures exchanges in the US. Many tonnes are bought and sold daily as big market makers continually quote two-way prices (buying and selling prices) to other traders and to clients, adjusting them throughout the day and night. In Europe the standard trading quantity is 4,000 troy ounces. The unit of trading in international markets is the so-called London Good Delivery Bar. Each bar must contain between 350 and 430 troy ounces of gold and have a minimum purity of 995 parts per 1,000. Bars must be in good condition and bear a serial number and assay stamp from one of 49 acceptable gold melters and assayers worldwide. London has an important role in world bullion markets, not least because of the fix. Every working day at 10.30 am and 3 pm London time, representatives of five bullion houses meet at the offices of N. M. Rothschild to fix the price of gold. Also at the fix are Mocatta &amp; Goldsmid, Sharps Pixley, Samuel Montagu and Mase-Westpac. Most of them have been trading gold for centuries and Mocatta can trace its history back to 1671. At the fix each representative has a telephone line open to trading rooms where dealers are in touch with customers. Potential price movements are unlimited during the fixing and the process has been known to take as much as two hours when the market is particularly volatile. There are two big attractions to being in at the fix. First, it is a truly open market where buyers and sellers are brought almost directly into contact with one another by means of modern technology. Second, the fix remains the one place to transact very large volume trades because the wide network of traders involved is in touch with so many customers in so many places simultaneously. The result is a single market clearing price. There is no bid-offer spread but a negotiable commission applies. The fix is held in such regard that it has effectively become the benchmark for the gold market. Many mines, for example, sell their production at the average of the London morning and afternoon fixes over a period of perhaps a month. There are several other firms apart from the five fixers making a two-way market in gold in London. Other organisations will quote to customers on a commission basis and lay off the risk with the professional market makers. The international market in London, Sydney, Hong Kong and Zurich is known as the loco London market because gold is quoted for delivery in London. Participants usually have a metal account with a London dealer to be credited or debited as gold is bought or sold. Most transactions do offer physical delivery and every transaction is made on the basis of being deliverable. The gold in London vaults effectively underwrites the credits clients have with banks. London has another advantage over other bullion markets: the presence of the Bank of England. The bank has a unique status in the gold industry. It is not just another gold repository recognised by the International Monetary Fund. It has a long history as an even-handed agent in the gold market for many other central banks. The bank acts as the regulator of the London Bullion Market Association which was set up in 1987 and covers all aspects of gold dealing in London. Outside London, most spot trading is done through Zurich. This dates back to 1968 when the London market closed temporarily at the request of the US Treasury and gave Switzerland's big three banks - Union Bank of Switzerland, Credit Suisse and Swiss Bank Corporation - access to South African production for the first time. Previously South African gold had been marketed exclusively through London. As well as selling spot gold, bullion traders arrange swaps (where the seller promises to buy the gold back at an agreed price at an agreed future date), and make prices for forward delivery. In recent years options trading has become an integral part of the market. Some observers argue that this increasing sophistication of the bullion markets has contributed substantially to today's quiet conditions and to present low prices. Forward prices and options enable producers and industrial consumers to hedge their future commitments while providing valuable access for investors. However, some analysts suggest this type of trading has resulted in some of the price volatility disappearing from the bullion market. Dealers love volatility because it generates more income and helps to attract more investors. Forward selling and options trading has become very common among western gold producers because these devices enable miners to lock in guaranteed profits. In exchange they sacrifice a potentially higher return. However, there is no denying the market impact. When the gold price rises the rush of producers to sell more gold forward places a cap on any further increase. Ironically, the lower the gold price sinks, the more pressure is put on miners to sell forward and stop it going up again. So the clever schemes made available by bullion dealers have distorted the impact low prices usually have on supply and demand. Much more gold mining capacity would have gone out of production by now - perhaps putting the price back on an upward trend - if not for the aggressive forward selling programmes followed by many Australian and North American mining companies. These have been protecting them from low spot prices. Even South African gold output is only slightly down since the recent peak in 1988 - by 20 tonnes to 601 tonnes last year - but only partly because of the protection give by forward sales. Much more important is the South African industry's ability to take many other steps - such as to stop mining uneconomic seams and to concentrate on those where gold is more abundant and more easily accessible - rather than closing mines. This cannot continue for ever and analysts agree that some substantial South African mine closures are in the offing. They also point out that it is becoming much less attractive for gold miners to sell forward, so this barrier to price rises might prove less effective in future. The unknown quantity in the gold market is the future behaviour of the central banks. Between them they have more than 35,600 tonnes of the metal in their vaults, equivalent to about 17 years' production. In the past few years the central banks have been net sellers and have the potential to cap price rises in the second half of the 1990s as effectively as forward selling by producers has done in the past few years. Perhaps the biggest bet on a gold price increase has been placed by Newmont Mining of the US, the biggest producer outside South Africa. On April 29 this year - the day the gold price was fixed in London at Dollars 333 an ounces, its lowest point for six years - Newmont bought 11.7 tonnes of gold (375,000 ounces) at a cost of nearly Dollars 126m to pay back early a large gold loan. Mr Jim Hill, Newmont's vice-president, corporate relations, says: 'We felt that, whereas the gold price might go down a few more dollars, the trend from now on would be up.' Bullion dealers fervently hope Newmont is right.</p>

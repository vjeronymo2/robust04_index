			<p>BFN     [Text] President Itamar Franco today stated in Brasilia  that the government is determined to conclude the constitutional  revision process. In brief remarks to reporters at Planalto  Palace, Franco also commented on the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic  Movement Party] in his government and the implementation of the  real:    [Begin Franco recording] There is nothing to fear about the  implementation of the real because the government will announce  the date for its implementation 35 days in advance.    The government has never stopped supporting the  constitutional revision process, but I have stressed that the  revision is an issue that falls within the specific jurisdiction  of Congress. The government is, however, determined to  successfully complete the constitutional revision process.    It is not important at this time to discuss who is to blame  for the impasse. If the members of Congress are willing to sit  and discuss with us segments of the constitutional revision, we  are ready to do that.    I am a founding member of the PMDB; I was the eighth member  to sign the national PMDB list. But the problem rests with the  party. If the PMDB decides to withdraw its support for the  government, it will do it. The PMDB should keep in mind,  however, that PMDB members served for several months in  important ministerial posts. Thus, if the government has not  succeeded in meeting the PMDB's desires, then the PMDB should  certainly assume its share of responsibility for this failure.  [end recording]</p>

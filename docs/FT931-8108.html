			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: Court rejects payout PEOPLE who lost money on investment bond home income plans because they followed bad advice from commissioned sales agents were defeated this week in their attempt to get extra compensation from the Investors Compensation Scheme. The plans were sold late in the 1980s, mainly to elderly people, as a 'safe' way of releasing income from their homes. In fact, the schemes involved taking out a mortgage and investing in equity-linked bonds. But the value of the bonds fell as interest rates rose and house prices dropped, pushing many people into debt. Investors bought such things as holidays, believing they were spending interest earned on their home's capital. But they were actually consuming the capital itself. The case against the ICS was brought in the High Court by solicitors Barnett Sampson, which argued that the ICS had interpreted its rules irrationally in deciding compensation. Barnett Sampson claimed the ICS should include money spent mistakenly by clients because of wrong advice, and that victims should get damages for distress and anxiety. These arguments were rejected but the claimants did win one significant victory. The court allowed a relative or 'personal representative' to bring or pursue compensation on behalf of a victim who had died. The ICS had refused to consider claims brought by relatives after a victim's death, or to pay compensation if the victim died before an offer had been made. This seemed particularly unfair, since victims are mostly elderly and the compensation process lengthy. The case illustrates the arbitrary nature of the compensation process. If the home income plan was sold by a direct salesman or tied agent of an insurance company, the victim is arguably in a better position than anyone who dealt with an independent financial adviser. Large insurance companies, mindful of their reputations, have the resources and incentive to settle a claim in full. But independent advisers, authorised by Fimbra, usually are small companies with fewer resources and no national reputation to safeguard. If the adviser collapses under the weight of claims, investors can turn only to the ICS, which has different rules. Lautro, the self-regulatory body for the insurance industry, requires a company to return people to the position in which they would have been had they not invested. But the court ruling means the same does not hold true for those getting compensation from the ICS. Its maximum payout per claim is Pounds 48,000 and it has awarded Pounds 5.5m to 327 of an estimated 1,650 claimants. Barnett Sampson is appealing against the ruling.</p>

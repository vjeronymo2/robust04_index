			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Shares rise worldwide on revival hopes HOPES that the surprise cut in German interest rates will help revive the fragile European economy pushed up share prices on most world markets yesterday. It lifted share prices in the US, where investors see a strengthening of America's economic revival by increased demand for its exports. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a record 3,416.74, up 42.95. The Bundesbank's move quelled fears that the European exchange rate might be in for another turbulent period after last weekend's forced devaluation of the Irish punt. The most immediate gainers were the Danish krone and the French franc following a rush of funds out of D-Marks. Both the Danish and French currencies had, until yesterday, been pinned relatively close to their ERM floors by the strong D-Mark. Sterling, which has been steadily losing ground since last week's base rate cut, gained sharply against the D-Mark. By last night the system's hard core currencies - the D-Mark, French franc and the Benelux currencies - were all trading close to one another in the ERM grid. However there was some disappointment at the relatively small cut. The European bond markets showed little change on the day, although German government bonds finished slightly lower. The best performers included the Milan and Paris bourses, both of which gained about 1.5 per cent, while the German rate cut move triggered an after-hours trading flurry on the Frankfurt exchange. The London stock market reacted cautiously. The FT-SE 100 index of leading shares gained 26 points before the Bundesbank announcement to reach a high of 2,900.1, the first time the index had breached the 2,900 mark. But the index slipped back to a close of 2,865.9, down 7.9 on the day, after widespread profit-taking. The FT-SE Eurotrack 100 index, which tracks prices of leading company shares across Europe, closed below the day's highs at 1,113.35, for a gain of 16.32. Sterling rose to DM2.395 immediately after the Bundesbank announcement, closing in London slightly lower at DM2.39 for an overall gain of 3 pfennigs on the day. The pound closed against the dollar at Dollars 1.445, just over 1 cent up on the day. In New York sterling closed at DM2.3897 and Dollars 1.4415.</p>

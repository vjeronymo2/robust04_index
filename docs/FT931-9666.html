			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tory jitters over strategy on Europe A BATTLE for hearts and minds over the next crucial Maastricht vote was under way in the Commons yesterday amid widespread doubt among backbenchers of all parties as to the wisdom of the government's high-risk strategy. As officials in the Foreign Office began to prepare briefing notes on the juridical and political implications of a government defeat on the social chapter, the Euro-sceptics were drafting their own counter-propaganda at a rival office in Westminster. In the Commons, however, speculation is mounting as to what would happen in the event of a government defeat following the unequivocal stance taken by Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary. Several Conservative backbenchers voiced serious disquiet at the decision to make vote on Labour's social chapter amendment the acid test of the prime minister's authority. With the outcome on a knife-edge, government loyalists backed the tactic. They argued that Mr Hurd's uncompromising warning that defeat could kill the treaty will help shore up the Conservatives' narrow 21 vote majority. However even among these, few believed that he has any chance of achieving the secondary objective of persuading pro-European Labour and Liberal Democrats to break ranks with their colleagues to save the treaty. Furthermore, doubts were spreading to the Tory backbenches over the government's assertion that approval of the Labour amendment would leave it a stark choice between accepting the social chapter or sinking the treaty. A number of Tories who dis-approved of Lord Tebbit's inflammatory speech on Wednesday, nonetheless, believe him correct in saying the amendment would make treaty ratification more difficult with no concomitant obligation on Britain to accept its social protocol. Sir Nicholas Bonsor, Tory chairman of the defence select committee, said yesterday that he had given an undertaking to ministers that he would not back the social chapter. But he insisted that he was not certain that this would be the inevitable consequence of voting for the Labour amendment. 'I would not vote for some-thing that would enforce the social chapter, but if it does not do that, I remain entirely undecided,' he said. Several Tory MPs also questioned whether the government's early unveiling of one of its most powerful sanctions was not a mistake. One even cited Mr Major's celebrated claim that he was the greatest Euro-sceptic in his cabinet to suggest that perhaps the government might be unworried by defeat. 'The prime minister has to show his European partners that he has fought as hard as he could for the treaty,' he observed. 'But if in the end it was defeated, Mr Major would still be able to make that claim while having regained a united party.' Labour business managers believe that the government's only hope of victory depends on doing a deal with the Ulster unionists.</p>

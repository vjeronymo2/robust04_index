			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Guatemala City, 2 Apr (DPA) -- The slaying of  Constitutionality Court President Epaminondas Gonzalez Dubon is  not an isolated incident, much less a common crime,  personalities we have consulted have told DPA. [passage  omitted] Meanwhile, Supreme Court President Juan Jose Rodil  Peralta issued a strong statement condemning the killing, which  adversely affects the state of law in Guatemala. Rodil Peralta  added this killing demonstrates those responsible for numerous  acts of violence in the past are still on the loose.    Gonzalez Dubon's wife, the main witness to the killing, said  she does not believe the motive of the killing was a car theft,  as certain versions have reported. She added there was no  attempt to steal the car, and the assailants unloaded their  weapons into the car, damaging it badly.    According to another version, unidentified gunmen were  following Gonzalez, who tried to take shelter in his home, where  they reached him. Apparently, police protection at the victim's  home had been withdrawn due to the recent change of the interior  minister. Gonzalez' body was taken to a funeral parlor, where  several people have come to express their condolences, including  lawyers, former magistrates, and other Guatemalan political  personalities. Gonzalez's funeral was scheduled for tomorrow,  after being honored at the Constitutionality Court.</p>

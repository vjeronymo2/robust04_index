			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / UK Company News: EFM Dragon bid acceptances EFM Dragon said yesterday it had received acceptances from 39.7 per cent of shareholders of fellow investment trust Drayton Asia. The all-share bid from EFM has been countered by reconstruction proposals from Drayton Asia, which offer shareholders the choice of a unit trust or a new split capital investment trust. EFM Dragon had irrevocable acceptances, or letters of intent, from 36.7 per cent of the shareholders before the Drayton proposals were announced. It has extended its offer to March 30.</p>

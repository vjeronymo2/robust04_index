			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / International Company News: Computer Associates posts record fourth quarter Computer Associates, one of the largest software companies, reported record fourth-quarter results as sales of its programs for mid-range client-server computer systems increased sharply. Net income for the quarter ended March 31 rose 60 per cent to Dollars 158.8m, or 93 cents per share, from Dollars 99.1m or 57 cents per share. Revenues were Dollars 633.7m, an increase of 17 per cent over Dollars 540.1m in the same period last year. Earnings were well above Wall Street expectations and the group's share price gained Dollars 6 1/8 to trade at Dollars 43 1/4 at mid-day in New York. Costs were essentially flat despite a strong increase in revenues. For the full year net income grew 63 per cent to Dollars 401.3m or Dollars 2.34 per share, up from Dollars 245.5m or Dollars 1.44 per share last time. Revenues were Dollars 2.15bn, up 17 per cent from Dollars 1.84bn in the prior 12 months. Revenues from software for mid-range computers more than doubled in the fourth quarter, said Mr Charles Wang, chairman and chief executive. 'In order to continue building on our mid-range client server foundation, the company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire The ASK Group, earlier this month,' he noted. The acquisition is the first big purchase by Computer Associates in two years, but since the company was formed in 1976 it has bought more than 40 other software companies to put together the broadest portfolio of products outside the personal computer sector. Also during the fourth quarter the group announced an agreement with Electronic Data Systems to settle a lawsuit filed against EDS, alleging that EDS had distributed CA products without paying proper licensing fees. Under the terms of the agreement EDS will standardise on Computer Associates' software worldwide, and will also become a reseller of its products. 'The CA-EDS agreement was the largest single software licensing transaction ever completed,' said Mr Wang. 'We look forward to the prospects for fiscal year 1995 with optimism.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Guangzhou, April 17 (XINHUA) -- South China's  Guangdong Province is now carrying out a publicity campaign for  the "teachers' law".    The campaign, which aims at studying the law and promoting  its implementation, started on April 15 and will last for a  month.    China's teachers' law came into force on January 1 this  year.    In recent years, Guangdong has adopted measures to  consolidate its contingent of teachers and to raise their status  and treatment.    The province has given 405 teachers the title of teachers  with special classification, and since 1991 has awarded 14  teachers the "outstanding teacher prize".    In the past eight years, Guangdong Province constructed 10  million square meters of residential accommodation, for 110,000  teachers' households.    It also allocated 30 million yuan as allowances to teachers  at universities and colleges.    Since 1993, the provincial government allocated more than 50  million yuan as subsidy for teachers working in 30 counties in  mountain areas.    A government official said that 9.46 billion yuan was spent  on education last year, 61.8 percent more than the previous year.    Dongguan city last year recruited more than 1,000 teachers  from other places, and Foshan city invested more than 13 million  yuan in a teacher-training program.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Applications in a thirty-day notice and cut-off filing group. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  For applications in a thirty-day notice and cut-off filing group, the FCC may attempt to resolve the mutual exclusivity by facilitating a settlement between the applicants. If a settlement is not reached within a reasonable time, the FCC may designate all applications in the filing group for comparative consideration in a hearing. In this event, the result of the hearing disposes all of the applications in the filing group. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Applications in a same-day filing group. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  If there are two or more mutually exclusive applications in a same-day filing group, the FCC may attempt to resolve the mutual exclusivity by facilitating a settlement between the applicants. If a settlement is not reached within a reasonable time, the FCC may designate all applications in the filing group for comparative consideration in a hearing. In this event, the result of the hearing disposes all of the applications in the filing group. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Applications in a window filing group. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Applications in a window filing group are processed in accordance with the procedures for a thirty-day notice and cut-off filing group in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Terminology. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  For the purposes of this section, terms have the following meanings: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The ``filing date'' of an application is the date on which that application was received in a condition acceptable for filing or the date on which the most recently filed major amendment to that application was received, whichever is later, excluding major amendments in the following circumstances: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The major amendment reflects only a change in ownership or control found by the FCC to be in the public interest; or, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The major amendment as received is defective or otherwise found unacceptable for filing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) An ``application for initial authorization'' is: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Any application requesting an authorization for a new system or station; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Any application requesting authorization for an existing station to operate on an additional channel, unless the additional channel is for paired two-way radiotelephone operation, is in the same frequency range as the existing channel(s), and will be operationally integrated with the existing channel(s) such as by trunking; or, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Any application requesting authorization for a new transmitter at a location more than 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) from any existing transmitters of the applicant licensee on the requested channel. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) An ``application for modification'' is any application other than an application for initial authorization or renewal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;22.719  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Additional channel policy for rural radiotelephone stations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The rules in this section govern the processing of applications for central office stations that request a rural radiotelephone channel pair when the applicant has applied for or been granted an authorization for other rural radiotelephone channel pairs in the same area. The general policy of the FCC is to promote effective use of the spectrum by encouraging the use of spectrum-efficient technologies (i.e. BETRS) and by assigning the minimum number of channels necessary to provide service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Transmitters in same area. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Any central office station transmitter on any channel pair listed in &sect;22.725 is considered to be in the same area as another central office station transmitter on any other channel pair listed in &sect;22.725 if the transmitting antennas are located within 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) of each other. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Initial channel pairs. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The FCC does not assign more than two channel pairs for new central office stations, unless there are more than eight rural subscriber stations to be served. Stations are considered to be new if there are no authorized transmitters on any channel listed in &sect;22.725 controlled by the applicant in the same geographic area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Additional channel pairs. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Applications for central office station transmitters to be located in the same area as an authorized central office station controlled by the applicant, but to operate on a different channel pair(s) are considered as requests for additional channel pair(s) for the authorized central office station. The FCC may grant applications for additional channel pairs provided that the need for each additional channel pair (after the first two) is established and fully justified in terms of achieving the required grade of service (blocking probability), and the applicant demonstrates that there will still be adequate spectrum available in the area to meet realistic estimates of current and future demand for paging, two-way mobile and rural radiotelephone services. In the case of conventional rural radiotelephone central office stations, an explanation must be provided as to why BETRS technology is not being used instead of additional channel pairs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Conventional Rural Radiotelephone Stations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;22.725  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Channels for conventional rural radiotelephone stations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following channels are allocated for paired assignment to transmitters that provide conventional rural radiotelephone service. These channels may be assigned for use by central office or rural subscriber stations as indicated, and interoffice stations. These channels may be assigned also for use by relay stations in systems where it would be impractical to provide rural radiotelephone service without the use of relay stations. All channels have a bandwidth of 20 kHz and are designated by their center frequencies in MegaHertz. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

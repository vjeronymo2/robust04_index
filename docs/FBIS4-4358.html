			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Statement by National Assembly Chairman Nong Duc Manh to </F> TUAN BAO QUOC TE reporter: "National Assembly Is Directly  Responsible..."]    [Text] National Assembly Chairman Nong Duc Manh has  made a statement to the TUAN BAO QUOC TE reporter on the changes  in the activities of Vietnam's legislative organ.  <H5>  The National Assembly belongs to all strata of the </H5> population.    Unlike in Vietnam, other countries do not have superior  monks  and bishops in their national assemblies. Vietnam's National  Assembly brings together representatives of all strata of the  working population in society. The national assemblies of  other countries assemble political forces in society, which  include rightist, leftist, and communist parties. For instance,  there are no representatives of Buddhists in their national  assemblies.    Our National Assembly now must decide things for itself, for  nobody else makes these decisions for it. Whether its  decisions are right or wrong, it must be responsible for them to  the people. The budget is insufficient. Whereas in other  countries the national assemblies will be removed if they fail  to fulfill their responsibilities to the constituents, this does  not happen in our country yet. However, as it represents all  strata of the masses in society, Vietnam's National Assembly has  the foundation on which it can make sure that its decisions  serve the interests of society as a whole.  <H5>  The National Assembly contributes to foreign policy </H5> successes.    In late October 1993, a delegation of the National Assembly  visited many countries in eastern and northwestern Europe.  National assemblies are the organs that ratify the agreements  of governments. Through contacts, legislators understand one  another better and create favorable conditions for the  implementation of the agreements that have been signed. The  bilateral and multilateral activities that our National Assembly  has taken part in would facilitate the implementation of the  agreements among governments.    The timing of the delegation's tour -- the end of October  1993 -- was also very beneficial. That was the time when the  national assemblies of those countries discussed their budget  and the major policies for 1994. Through exchanges of views,  the national assemblies of other countries seemed to have a good  understanding of Vietnam's renovation and to lend their support  and encouragement to increasing investment in Vietnam.  <H5>  To apply the experiences of other countries' national </H5> assemblies.    In our recent visit in a number of countries, we exchanged  with their national assemblies our experience in the legislative  process. We have just begun to do legislative work, which  other countries have been doing for a long time. The question  that was raised was how to make laws and how to organize the  supporting machinery in order to allow it to work effectively.  In all other countries, legislators are professional people,  but they are not in Vietnam. This is why when we apply other  countries' experiences, we must consider Vietnam's actual  conditions.    We will step by step improve the activities of specialized  committees. Right in the current session, the evaluating  reports of our committees are judged as being of very good  quality. Our committees will be strengthened and given more  specialized work. The supporting component must be made better  and stronger so as to carry on its work of assisting the  National Assembly sessions and preparing documents for the  deputies to read and study in advance. We will also reorganize  the Office of the National Assembly; improve the ways to  organize offices, committees, and scientific research libraries  in regard to jurisdictional issues; and provide the Office of  the National Assembly with additional modern means.</p>

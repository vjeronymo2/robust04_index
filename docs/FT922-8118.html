			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Five appointed to PM's policy unit MR JOHN MAJOR took a further small step towards open government yesterday by announcing who had been appointed to the Downing Street policy unit. The five new members of the unit were appointed on the advice of the unit's head, Mrs Sarah Hogg. She took over within days of Mr Major becoming prime minister but inherited some colleagues from Mrs Thatcher's policy unit. Joining the Downing Street team are: Mr David Poole, on secondment from James Capel where he is a director; Ms Lucy Neville-Rolfe, a civil servant from the ministry of agriculture; Ms Katharine Ramsay, formerly a ministerial special adviser; Mr Damian Green, formerly industrial editor of the Channel Four Business Daily programme and unsuccessful Tory candidate in Brent East last month; and Ms Jill Rutter, a Treasury civil servant. Mr Nick True, the unit's deputy head, and Mr Alan Rosling, continue in their posts. While the announcement was the first formal press notice of such appointments, membership of the policy unit has scarcely been a matter of state secrecy in the past.</p>

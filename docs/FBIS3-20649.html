			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by reporters Wen Hongyan [3306 4767 1750] and Zhang </F> Youxin [1728 0645 2450]]    [Text] Haiyan, 15 Dec -- The Qinshan nuclear power plant,  China's first domestically designed and built nuclear power  plant, which is located in Haiyan County, Zhejiang Province, has  generated a total of 2.145 billion kWh of electricity since it  joined the grid on 15 December 1991 up until 15 December 1993,  and especially in the last year, it has produced 1.62 billion  kWh, 207.7 percent over its planned annual output, and operating  at a load factor of 64.46 percent, it is two years ahead of its  planned operating capability.    Two years of safe and stable operations of this plant  demonstrates that China is fully capable of self-development in  nuclear power. The Qinshan Nuclear Power Corporation which runs  the plant, has adhered a strict policy of "quality and safety  first," and has been persistent in scientific management, and in  multi-level training of its personnel. It fully completed every  aspect of its debugging mission in two years, getting an  excellent high rate of operational efficiency out of its 300MW  units. The daily output of its units is now 7.2 million kWh, and  the plant has entered full operational test stage.    The latest statistics from the environmental monitoring  department shows that the radiation level from particles in  waste water discharge is 0.015 Curies, less than the nationally  specified limit (20 Curies) of one to one-thousand parts;  chimney discharge of inert gases totalled 0.70 Curies, or just  at the state-set limit (70,000 Curies) of one to 100,000 parts.</p>

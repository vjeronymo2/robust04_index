			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with AMO ZIL General Director Yevgeniy Brakov, </F> conducted by Stanislav Afonin: "The ZIL: A Head-On Collision"]    [Text] General Director Yevgeniy Brakov on the  reasons for the acute crisis.    [Correspondent] Yevgeniy Alekseyevich, the threat of  collapse  hangs over the automotive plants of Russia, including also the  ZIL. Why has such a thing happened?    [Brakov] The breakup of the Union has led to a sharp  reduction in the production of our basic product--automobiles.  While in 1985 we manufactured 212,000 trucks, already in 1993 we  were able to assembly only 100,000, and that with some  difficulty. Production continues to decline due to lack of  consumer funds. Such a thing has never happened before at the  ZIL. The collective is literally in shock. After all, not that  long ago we supplied the army with somewhere on the order of  55,000 "ZIL-131" vehicles. Last year this figure was only...  640. The farms bought about 30,000 vehicles annually. Last year  this figure was only... 200. Ukraine used to buy 22,000  automobiles. Today, due to the non-clearance of payments in  rubles, its market has in fact been lost to us. The situation is  about the same with Kazakhstan, the Central Asian states, as  well as all the former Union republics.    It is difficult for me, the director, to explain to the  workers what has happened. Up until recently, the payment for  our equipment came to the Central Bank of Russia. But because  there was no balance of payments between Russia and the  Commonwealth countries, the money was returned.    Today we may supposedly manage our products as we see  fit--we  may sell to whomever we want. Yet in fact this is not so. We are  deprived of the opportunity of working directly with our  partners. Why? Why, because the state hinders the transfer of  money. Moreover, they have taxed us from all sides with all  manner of taxes.    [Correspondent] If I understand you correctly, the  government  has removed itself from any aid to state enterprises?    [Brakov] I would go even farther. It has not only removed  itself, but it hinders us in our normal operations. Even when  there was the ruble transfer of money, its normal receipt for  our products was hindered. Today we have been deprived  altogether of a sales market in the former USSR republics. Both  they and we have been placed in a most difficult position. The  ZIL is forced to independently seek means of mutual accounting  with its partners through third countries, through barter and  commodity exchange.    Despite the optimistic assurances of certain state leaders,  the decline in production continues. How will we survive? After  all, what is the ZIL conveyer? Standing "behind the back" of  each person working at it, there are at least 100 people. These  are metal producers, miners, manufacturers of electrical wire,  glass, tires, plastic, and so forth. If the automotive plant  stops, the entire series of enterprises begins to get feverish.  We can imagine how many people find themselves under the threat  of unemployment.    Today in Russia practically all the state enterprises are  debtors. We all owe each other. And the state--through taxes.  The government has not settled accounts with the peasants for  grain, and they have no money to buy equipment, spare parts or  fuel-lubricant materials. Seventy percent of the pool of ZIL  automobiles on the farms are at least 8 years old. Our equipment  is expected to last 10 years. What will happen in 2 years?    Or let us take another problem. It was decided that working  capital would not be re-appraised with the re-appraisal of  surplus finished products. We were also promised preferential  credits for replentishing our working capital. The government  has still not fulfilled its obligation. Our plant, like other  state enterprises having a large reserve of material resources  and long-standing economic ties, has found itself in a trap. If  we do not get state support, the ZIL will once again grind to a  halt. And for a long time.    [Correspondent] And what are you yourselves doing in order  to  keep afloat?    [Brakov] Unfortunately, little here depends on the plant.  First of all, we must stop the bacchanalia with the level of  wages in the sector. Judge for yourselves. Next to us is another  plant, and the wages of its workers are two or three times  higher. Compare them with the automobile industry abroad. The  wage level at different enterprises fluctuates there by only a  few dollars. The ZIL worker today earns an average of 100,000  rubles [R]. What can you buy for that?    Secondly, we must immediately settle accounts with the farm,  with the army and with the defense industry. Our contractors  will have money, and they will begin to take the automobiles.  Then we too will deduct funds to the state budget.    Thirdly, it has long been time to straighten out the matter  of taxes. They have simply suffocated us, the manufacturers. At  the initiative of the government, there was a re-appraisal of  the fixed capital. For the ZIL there was a 28.7-time increase.  Up until recently, we paid tax in the amount of 1.5 percent on  the fixed capital. Last year this was R400 million. Now we must  pay 2 percent. It seems that this is not so much, only half a  percent more. But this is already not R400 million, but rather  R40 billion. Last year our profits for the entire ZIL were R60  billion. Is it conceivable that we can withstand such a tax  press?    We are up to our ears in credit debts. We are being granted  credits at 250-300 percent, and for a period of 2 or 3 months.  The banks will not risk giving money for a long term.    How can we speak of any kind of development or technical  progress if the plant is always working feverishly. We are  living one day at a time. Not living, but surviving. A few years  ago, the decision was made regarding the changeover of the ZIL  to the manufacture of automobiles which operate on diesel fuel.  We began building a diesel engine plant in Yartsevo of Smolensk  Oblast, and at the main plant we began developing extensive  press and body production. We began developing and modernizing  branch plants. Now, it turns out, no one needs any of this. We  might ask, who is going to untangle all this (supposedly  market-related) mess?</p>

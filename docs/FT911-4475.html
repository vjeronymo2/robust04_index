			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / Arts: Rambert Dance Company - Riverside Studios If there is a more hideous, confusing and hazardous spot in Europe than Hammersmith Broadway and its tube station, I hope never to have to negotiate it to see a dance programme. Prospective visitors to Riverside, where Rambert Dance Company has opted to give its London seasons - the troupe in quest of more movement space than Sadler's Wells can offer - are hereby warned. It would be good to report that, whatever the hurdles, the trip is worth while, but Tuesday's opening, though eminently well-intentioned, was not calculated to set the pulse racing. The choice of Riverside - a small auditorium, not blessed with the best sightlines - gives Rambert more room to move and far less audience seating than at the Wells, which makes for a doubtful equation. It also alters the perspective of the dance. At the start of the evening Merce Cunningham's Doubles sat less than easily on the Rambert dancers in this exposed location (they appeared slightly self-conscious) and the audience's view of Cunningham's spatial relationships was foreshortened when seen (as here) from above. Doubles looked honest but not especially polished. As a fashion note let me observe that the three girls in the cast had neat hair, which helps stress the purity of physical line so significant with Cunningham, while the three men boasted what appeared to be badly knitted dreadlocks - no help to the dance's precisions. The company has now acquired Siobhan Davies' Plainsong, which was first made for Davies' own group a decade ago. It is visually elegant - unisex shirts and trousers for the cast, in shades of grey - and stresses a frieze-like progression of dance ideas, passed through a line of dancers, or shared and dispersed among the performers. A grave problem with the piece is its score  -an interminable sequence of dull Satie piano works (and are there any duller?) which sound like doors holding a conversation. It is very worthy as dance, subtle in its shifts of emphasis, and somehow monochrome. Richard Alston's Roughcut uses two Steve Reich scores (for guitar and clarinet) whose patternings are the basis for an 'end of the evening' piece which, in the context of the Rambert repertory, is positively vivacious. There are jazzy elements - admirably caught thing not unlike a blues duet for Amanda Britton and Mark Baldwin. The cast are kept on the qui vive by vigorous movement, and are made to look fatuous by Tim Hatley's costumes - the girls in white, bare-midriff outfits that give them a matronly air; the men in trousers, cut with malign skill to make them seem portly, with braces over bare torsos. Dancers strive for physical grace and power; their costumiers should honour this fact.</p>

			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Price competition hits margins at Acorn ACORN COMPUTER Group, the UK-based computer manufacturer owned by Olivetti of Italy, saw turnover grow 11 per cent at the half-way stage, but margins were forced down by fierce price competition and higher component costs. Profitability was helped, however, by a first-time contribution from Advanced RISC Machines, in which the company has a 42.86 per cent interest. Pre-tax profits for the half-year to July 4 were Pounds 305,000, a decline of 40 per cent on last time's Pounds 511,000. Revenues totalled Pounds 23.6m (Pounds 21.2m). Earnings were 0.5p (0.8p). Mr Gary Johnson, finance director, said the decline in gross margins had been disappointing but a high point had been the performance of ARM which contributed Pounds 100,000 to profits. This company had moved into profitabil-ity about a year earlier than expected. ARM, co-owned by Apple Computer and VLSI Technology of the US, develops low cost microprocessors for portable computers. An ARM chip is used in Apple's heavily-promoted Newton personal digital assistant launched earlier this year. Acorn's shares have been boosted this year by investors anxious to share in ARM's potential success; however, they fell 23p to 88p yesterday.</p>

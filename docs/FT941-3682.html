			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Watmoughs shows 26% rise to Pounds 15.4m A buoyant domestic market for colour printing coupled with expansion in Spain and Hungary helped Watmoughs (Holdings), the Bradford-based printer, report a 26 per cent improvement last year. Pre-tax profits for the year to end-December rose from Pounds 12.2m to Pounds 15.4m on turnover up from Pounds 118.9m to Pounds 149.8m, including Pounds 14.1m from new operations. After adjusting for the capitalisation issue in October, earnings emerged at 15.9p (13p). A recommended final dividend of 5.1p (4.4p) raises the total to 6.6p (5.75p). The shares gained 7p to close at 511p. Mr Patrick Walker, chairman and chief executive, said the improvement reflected 'further progress in the group's UK activities, a successful start to Watmoughs Espana, and the continued expansion of Revai Nyomda in Hungary'. Operating profits increased by 38 per cent to Pounds 17m (Pounds 12.3m), including a Pounds 2.33m contribution from the new continental European operations. In the UK the advance achieved during the first half continued, and profit for the year rose by 11 per cent from Pounds 12m to Pounds 13.3m, despite reorganisation and redundancy costs of Pounds 471,000. Mr Walker said the improving trend in demand for the group's specialised gravure and web offset capacities in the UK continued throughout the year and sales rose by 12 per cent to Pounds 128.8m (Pounds 115m.) Net interest costs increased to Pounds 1.96m (Pounds 456,000) reflecting an increase in net borrowings to Pounds 43.8m (Pounds 26m). Gearing climbed to 47 per cent (27 per cent). The higher borrowings reflected the growth in capital expenditure last year which rose to Pounds 25.2m, including Pounds 13.8m to complete the group's gravure investment in Spain. COMMENT Tighter market conditions are providing Watmoughs with the opportunity to weed out contracts with thin margins and push up contract prices by an average 3 to 5 per cent as they come round for renewal. Both moves should help push UK margins higher. The group has invested more than Pounds 100m over the past three years in the UK and overseas, and now has some of the most up-to-date presses in the industry, as well as a growing business in southern and eastern Europe. Pre-tax profits should reach about Pounds 20m this year, producing about 20.7p of earnings. The shares have doubled in the past 15 months and are now trading on a lofty prospective multiple of 24.7. A quality stock for holding.</p>

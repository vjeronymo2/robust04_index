"I'm very optimistic. I believe this time NATO is seen as  the organisation who holds the key," said the source. "The UN  and the European Community are asking us to take action. If we  do not take action, we paralyse the international community."    The comments came after North Atlantic Treaty Organisation  ambassadors held "intense" consultations on the possibility of  airstrikes against the Bosnian Serbs around Sarajevo in the wake  of the weekend massacre of 68 people in a Sarajevo market.    The NATO ambassadors, who could take a decision on the issue  on Wednesday, are considering a request by UN Secretary General  Butrus Butrus-Ghali for action to deter any repetition of the  mortar attack    NATO Deputy Secretary General Sergio Silvio Balanzino  earlier  said: "As to air strikes I will have a very definite and clear  answer tomorrow. Stay tuned as they say on TV.... At this  stage, I can't say anything more."    Although upbeat, the source added the ambassadors would also  study the "wider implications" of such air strikes, and would  consider in particular a proposal by France for an ultimatum to  be put to the Bosnian Serbs.    France has said it would press for an ultimatum giving the  Serbs a few days to pull back their heavy guns from the  predominently Moslem Bosnian capital, even if the idea was  rejected by the EC ministers.    The idea was opposed by Britain, Greece and Spain here on  Monday, although it was supported by Belgium, Italy and the  Netherlands at a meeting of European Community foreign ministers.    Any decision on air strikes must be taken unanimously by the  North Atlantic Council, NATO's executive body.    Sources close to the alliance added that NATO Secretary  General Manfred Woerner, convalescing from surgery, may give a  press conference Wednesday on the outcome of the ambassadors'  meeting.    In August, NATO authorised the use of its warplanes to end  the strangulation of Sarajevo and other Serb-besieged Moslem  communities if requested by the United Nations.    But the pro-Serb Socialist government in Greece, which took  power in October, says airstrikes could trigger a wider Balkans  war and is threatening to veto the move since NATO operates on  consensus.    NATO currently has 170 aircraft, including 80 warplanes,  deployed to enforce a no-fly zone over Bosnia. But it faced  tough decisions in considering whether to unleash them against  the Serbs.    Although Butrus-Ghali sought authorisation for a punitive  strike as a deterrent to future shelling, European Community  foreign ministers on Monday backed the use of air power to lift  the siege of Sarajevo immediately.    The United States has also signaled its support for wider  action beyond what US Secretary of State Warren Christoper  called the "rather narrow request" of the UN chief.</p>

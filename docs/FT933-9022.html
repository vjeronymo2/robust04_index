			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Letter: Lloyd's controversy not resolved by vote Sir, Richard Lapper's report on the result of the ballot on Lloyd's business plan may have given the impression that the controversy is over and done with ('Lloyd's Names vote in support of business strategy', August 11). This is not the case. Claud Gurney and his fellow promoters of the July egm represent the 'Angry Brigade' among Lloyd's Names and were widely warned that their initiative was ill-timed and likely to be rebuffed. Those among the action groups who occupy the middle ground felt that peace should be given a chance to work, and that the weapon of veto should be reserved for when it was really needed, if at all. It remains the case that Lloyd's business plan will not succeed unless it preserves equity between the old and new generations of Lloyd's Names (the dividing line being January 1 1994), and between individual Names and corporate capital. The 20,000 Names (62 per cent of the membership) who are currently members of action groups are claiming compensation not because they are unwilling to meet 'commercial' losses, but because they are demonstrably the victims of professional negligence and misrepresentation on a scale without precedent in the City. All of these problems can be put to rest and litigation ended, but only if the Council of Lloyd's can come up with an appropriately large settlement package as a conclusion of its current disputes initiative. Half measures will not work, and the aggrieved Names command sufficient votes that, if properly marshalled, they will prevail.

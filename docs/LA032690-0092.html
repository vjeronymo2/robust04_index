			<p><P> March 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'GENERATIONS' DRAWS BLACKS DESPITE RATINGS  </P> <P> A year after NBC introduced "Generations" as the first daytime soap opera to  center around a black family, the program has won praise for its presentation  of black issues but remains locked in last place in the ratings.  </P> <P> According to A. C. Nielsen ratings released last week, "Generations," which  celebrates its first anniversary Tuesday, ranks 12th out of the 12 daily soaps  aired by the three major networks and 19th out of 21 daytime programs. It  reaches about 2 million households a day -- about a third of the audience  garnered by the highest ranked soap, CBS' "The Young and the Restless."  </P> <P> Airing weekdays at 11:30 a.m., "Generations" chronicles the lives of two  wealthy Chicago families, the Marshalls, who are black, and the Whitmores, who  are white. The families have been linked for three generations -- since the  days when the matriarch of the Marshalls worked as a maid for the matriarch of  the Whitmores.  </P> <P> Besides the typical soap fare of relationships, money and personal tragedy,  "Generations" gives viewers a dose of themes not normally seen in daytime  drama. Last year, one of the characters struggled with sickle-cell anemia, a  disease that strikes blacks, and the current story line involves racial hate  crimes that befall the Marshalls when they move into an all-white, upper-crust  neighborhood.  </P> <P> As television programs go, observed Gerald Horne, chairman of black studies at  the University of California at Santa Barbara, "Generations" has made progress  in portraying the black experience.  </P> <P> "Relative to some of the images that have been projected -- for example,  'Driving Miss Daisy,' which portrays blacks in an antiquated manner -- then at  least 'Generations' is a step forward," Horne said.  </P> <P> Where it falls short, Horne said, is in the fact that the Marshalls, because of  their wealth, are less than typical.  </P> <P> "I think 'Generations' and the other television programs have not really  captured the vast majority of the black American experience," Horne said. "They  either portray the extreme underclass or the very wealthy blacks. Most blacks  are somewhere in between."  </P> <P> NBC executives insist that the program's low ratings are to be expected after  only one year on the air and say that the network is as committed to  "Generations" as it was to "Hill Street Blues" in that groundbreaking series's  difficult first years.  </P> <P> Soap operas are a daily habit, and before viewers will bring a new show into  their lives, they have to be slowly weaned from other programs, explained Sally  Sussman, the program's creator and executive producer. She said that the show  will not be changed to court viewers.  </P> <P> "We came on the air as a landmark show fully integrated, and we've kept that  commitment even in the face of low ratings," she said. "We just hope the  audience will grow with us."  </P> <P> One factor in the show's favor comes, ironically, from the very obstacles that  blacks face in television. Because the job market for black actors is so  limited, the program has managed to snag and hold on to a number of fairly  well-known players, including Taurean Blacque, whose credits include "Hill  Street Blues" and "The White Shadow," and Richard Roundtree, who starred in the  "Shaft" movies of the 1970s.  </P> <P> "For a long time, I've been pushed into stereotypical roles as policemen" in  action films, said Roundtree. "I wanted to do some drama."  </P> <P> "My agent turned ('Generations') down two times," said Blacque, who plays Henry  Marshall, the entrepreneurial scion of the Marshall family and owner of a  string of ice cream parlors. "Coming off a hit show like 'Hill Street Blues,'  they didn't think I wanted to do a soap. But, when I read it, I saw what it  could do for me as a black person and what I could portray to the community."  </P> <P> The program's most recent addition is daytime Emmy winner Debbi Morgan, who  left a long-running stint on ABC's "All My Children" to join the fledgling  soap.  </P> <P> For these actors, the appeal is simple: "Most of what's out there is garbage,"  said Blacque.  </P> <P> "The younger generation, when they see (negative roles) all the time, they  think maybe that is something we ought to do -- be a pimp, sell drugs, drive a  big Cadillac," he said. "I think our responsibility to the younger people  coming up is to project a positive image."  </P> <P> NBC's motives in creating "Generations" were not entirely altruistic, however.  </P> <P> Statistics compiled by Nielsen Media Research show that blacks watch an average  of 55% more daytime television than other groups. And, before "Generations,"  NBC's daytime programming garnered fewer black viewers than the other  networks'.  </P> <P> "It was quite obvious that we were not reaching as much of the black audience  as the other guys, the other networks," said NBC spokesman Gene Walsh.  </P> <P> "Generations" ranks about equal with the other networks' major soaps in terms  of audience composition, with 21% of its audience black. It leads NBC's other  soaps: Just 11% of "Days of Our Lives" viewers are black, 12% of "Another  World" viewers and 16% of "Santa Barbara" viewers.  </P> <P> "One of the reasons the networks have been running more black shows and more  black characters is (that) blacks disproportionately don't have access to VCRs  and cable television and satellites," said Horne, the UCSB professor.  </P> <P> That means they are more likely than whites to watch network advertising and  buy the products offered for sale, Horne said.  </P> <P> Ron Dobson, vice president of daytime sales for NBC, said that while  "Generations" has not attracted advertising aimed specifically at blacks, the  increased percentage of black viewers -- even with the show's low ratings --  has meant an increase in ad revenues.  </P> <P> This year, commercials on "Generations" will cost 45% more than when the  program started, Dobson said. And, even at its inception, advertisers were  willing to pay 24% more for an ad on "Generations" than they were for an ad on  "Scrabble," the game show previously aired in its time slot.  </P> <P> One reason "Generations" is appealing to advertisers despite its low ratings is  that black households have 13% more women in them than other households, and  it's women that the advertisers are trying to reach, Dobson said.  </P> <P> While "Generations" has afforded black actors opportunities not generally found  in television, the people behind the scenes are mostly white. Sussman is white,  as are four of the show's six writers.  </P> <P> "I haven't found any more," Sussman said. "I don't know of any other black soap  opera writers."  </P> <P> She said that she would be open to a Writers Guild apprentice program for  minorities and women, but "they've never contacted me."  </P> <P> Blacque hopes this situation will change. "On both levels -- behind the scenes  and in the decision-making process, the writing staff -- of course there should  be more (blacks)," the actor said. "Because you need a black person to really  get to the essence of our experience as black people."  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MASS APPEALS;  </P> <P> HUMAN RIGHTS POSTERS MAKE SOME TIMELY PLEAS IN SANTA ANA  </P> <P> What does it take to open your mind, shock you into action or at least make you  sympathize with a cause? Can words and pictures on a poster do the job? Well,  the artists who anonymously produce this form of cheap, mass-produced,  throwaway art have never stopped believing in the good work they do.  </P> <P> An exhibit of 102 human rights posters at Rancho Santiago College Art Gallery  offers an excellent introduction to the diverse ways in which often highly  unpopular political issues have been presented to broad audiences around the  globe during the past couple of decades -- as well as to the issues themselves.  </P> <P> The timing of the exhibit is dead on: In today's climate of close-minded  conservatism and increasing hate crimes, human rights remain on the critical  list.  </P> <P> A sheaf of notes and an essay by Carol A. Wells, executive director of the  Center for the Study of Political Graphics and co-curator of the show (with  galley director Mayde Herberg) adds vital perspective and information --  particularly for younger viewers who may draw a blank at such names as Julius  and Ethel Rosenberg, Marian Anderson, Joseph McCarthy and James Bakke. The  posters in the show are clustered, regardless of date, according to familiar  themes: apartheid in South Africa; U.S.-aided right-wing government attacks on  Guatemalans, Salvadorans and Nicaraguans; the internment of American Japanese  during World War II; anti-Communist witch hunts in the United States during the  1950s; anti-Semitism; capital punishment; land rights for American Indians; the  civil rights movement; women's issues; AIDS; poverty.  </P> <P> Some of the posters make their appeal based on the oppression of victims, other  messages sharply accuse the viewer of indifference and still others celebrate  heroic leaders. Cliched but immediately recognizable imagery -- frequently of  mothers and children, people raising clenched fists or proud-looking women with  flowing hair -- dominates many posters; others make use of sophisticated  graphics and arty layouts. While the audience for one poster may be barely  literate, another is assumed to be capable of following a lengthy text with  complex arguments.  </P> <P> The posters were produced for reasons that actually have more in common with  the motivations of commercial advertising than with the traditional,  contemplative sphere of art. To say which posters represent the most effective  combinations of text and imagery, you would have to know for what audiences  they were intended.  </P> <P> As a white, female, educated, middle-class American, I gravitated to the  posters that most closely duplicate the approach of Madison Avenue -- the  language of manipulation with which I'm most familiar, with its penchant for  impressive statistics, snappy prose and riveting, one-shot images. Among them  are:  </P> <P> * Keith Haring's AIDS poster, "Ignorance Equals Fear," with its trio of "see  no/hear no/speak no evil" yellow cartoon figures and the striking pink triangle  logo developed by Act Up.  </P> <P> * Sheila Levrant de Bretteville's self-portrait with a branch tattooed over her  missing breast, lost to cancer ("I am no longer afraid of mirrors").  </P> <P> * The Guerrilla Girls' "Do women have to be naked to get into the Metropolitan  Museum?" (a photograph of a famous nude by Ingres wearing the underground  women's artists group trademark guerrilla head, with statistics about the  number of female artists represented at the Met, and the number of female  nudes).  </P> <P> * The Simon Wiesenthal Center's Holocaust reminder, with its photograph of  bitter mementos from the prison camps and literate text.  </P> <P> * "Whatever happened to . . . ," a sea of blank white silhouettes in a school  portrait, recalling government-sanctioned, CIA-supported eradication of unarmed  Guatemalan civilians.  </P> <P> * Lynn Okun's image of a map of Africa superimposed on a facet of a diamond  ring: "Some dream of diamonds, others of equality. Diamonds are forever. Africa  is now!"  </P> <P> * Susan Ocona's "Alone Invisible Homeless," a black poster with the barely  discernible black image of a homeless family.  </P> <P> But even the most homespun or hackneyed image in this show is rooted in human  rage, despair or celebration, and a powerful conviction that the world can be  changed for the better. The sheer moral force of all these images make the show  exceptional in our confused and callous times.  </P> <P> What  </P> <P> "Courageous Voices: An International Poster Exhibition on Racism, Sexism and  Human Rights."  </P> <P> When  </P> <P> Through Oct. 4. Gallery is open 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Monday through Thursday, 6:30  to 9 p.m. Tuesday and Wednesday, and 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. Friday (closed Saturday  and Sunday).  </P> <P> Where  </P> <P> Rancho Santiago College Art Gallery, Building C. Campus is at the corner of  Bristol Avenue and 17th Street in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> Whereabouts  </P> <P> Take the Santa Ana Freeway to 17th Street and drive west just past Bristol  (entrance is off 17th Street).  </P> <P> Wherewithal  </P> <P> Admission is free.  </P> <P> Where to call  </P> <P> (714) 667-3177.  </P></p>

			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Vestey arm poaches second Lonrho chief LONRHO, the international trading group, has lost its second executive within two months to Union International (UI), the troubled arm of the Vestey Group, one of Britain's largest private companies. Mr Paul Taylor, a former finance executive of Lonrho, who was part of a senior team evaluating projects and capital expenditure, has been appointed finance director of UI. He was recruited by Mr Terry Robinson, UI's chief executive, who in January left Lonrho where he had been a director since 1981. A businessman with an intimate knowledge of Lonrho yesterday described Mr Taylor's departure as a 'loss' to the group. He said Mr Taylor was 'a bright financial executive' who had responsibility for assessing and reviewing 'significant capital projects'. Lonrho's annual report revealed that Mr Taylor was one of 10 new associate directors designed to show that the group has the 'depth and breadth of management' to end speculation about the succession to Mr Tiny Rowland, its 74 year-old chief executive. The conglomerate yesterday made light of Mr Taylor's departure. A Lonrho director said: 'The company went on without Mr Robinson and it will go on to manage its business very well without Mr Taylor. We do not rely on one man.' It is understood that Mr Taylor will work closely with Mr Robinson on finalising the details of UI's three-year funding facility with its bankers. UI, which includes the Dewhurst butchers chain, is expected to publish its 1991 results in the summer once the funding facility has been agreed. The group has borrowings of about Pounds 350m.</p>

Mysterious Disappearance of Its Chairman"]    [Text] Overnight between 15 and 16 January, an armed attack  was made on the Rukh [Ukraine People's Movement for Perestroyka]  Secretariat in Kiev. As reported by RUKH-PRESS, two unknown  persons, claiming that they had to hand a package of documents  from Lvov to chairman of the Secretariat Mykhaylo Boychyshyn,  entered the reception room together with a watchman. As  Mykhaylo Boychyshyn was not there, the visitors started  telephoning him at home. After the call, which seems to have  remained unanswered, one of the attackers pulled out a pistol.  Hitting the guard on the head twice, he ordered that the  chairman of the Secretariat be found immediately. After the  watchman's refusal to fulfill the order, the attackers demanded  that another guard they had noticed before, be summoned. The  latter offered resistance and locked himself up in a room. The  RUKH-PRESS head, who was at work at the time, immediately called  the militia. Before the militiamen appeared, the armed "guests"  managed to escape. On the same day, chairman of the Secretariat  Mykhaylo Boychyshyn, who had left the office about three hours  prior to the attack, disappeared. His whereabouts are still not  known. The day before, the premises of the Ternopil regional  organization of Rukh were also subject to an armed attack. At  night, unknown persons got into the building through the second  floor window, broke the doors of the Information Center and of  other offices, and carried out a pogrom there. Having made  their way to the roof of the building, the offenders dismantled  and stole the installation for satellite antenna reception.  Law-enforcement organs have started an investigation.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Following his meeting with Admiral Khristos  Limberis, the YEETHA [National Defense General Staff] Chief, as  part of the traditional visit he is paying to the country,  Admiral Boorda, Allied Commander for Southern Europe, relations  with the Greek military leadership are being fully and  substantively smoothen out. Replying to correspondents'  questions, Admiral Boorda said he disagrees with a message  issued by his office (in his capacity as commander of the U.S.  Naval Forces in Europe) describing the new Greek Armed Forces  leaders as being pro-government.    He noted that the message was written by a young officer who  was trying to understand what was happening in Greece at that  time. He stressed that it was a shame that the text was leaked.  [passage omitted]    The admiral said this message certainly does not affect his  good relations with Admiral Limberis. He added that the Greek  YEETHA also issues messages that the chief possibly does not  check. Admiral Limberis agreed with this observation, noting  that it is practically impossible to check every message. He  noted, however, that measures should be taken in such cases.  During the talks, Boorda and Limberis discussed the issue of  the establishment of a NATO headquarters [in Greece],  particularly the installation of a multinational rapid  intervention division.

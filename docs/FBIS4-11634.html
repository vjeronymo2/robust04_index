			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Foreign Policy" column by Muhammad 'Abdallah: </F> "Who Is Saving Who"]    [Text] U.S. President Clinton met with Israeli Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Rabin at the White House 10 days ago to discuss  the Middle East peace process. At the time, Clinton was up to  his ears in the "Whitewater" scandal, while Rabin was up to his  ears in the scandalous massacre at the al-Ibrahimi mosque. Both  Clinton and Rabin were looking for ways to rescue them from  their scandal or crisis.    Rabin was seeking to get from Clinton something to  consolidate the Israeli position -- to disregard the massacre  and resume the peace talks. Perhaps the Israeli prime minister  was looking for some kind of a position on the part of the  United States that could calm down the Israeli right after the  "punitive" measures that his government had taken against the  extremist rightists, including the outlawing of the Kakh and  Kahana Hay movements, the expulsion of leading Jewish extremists  from Hebron, and the disarming of some others.    Likewise, it seems that Clinton was seeking to get moral  support from Rabin in the face of the tremendous media campaign  against him and his wife, in which the Jewish-owned media organs  are naturally taking part. The U.S. President saw in this an  opportunity to appease these parties by adopting a strong  position in favor of Rabin and Israel. On the eve of his talks  with Rabin, the U.S. President stood up to say that he supported  Jerusalem as the unified capital of Israel -- meaning that East  Jerusalem will not be the capital of the coming State of  Palestine, which is still on the far horizon.    This is the way politics sometimes is when someone is in a  weak position; and both men were in such a position. That is  why the United States, in various ways, backed off from  Clinton's remarks; and Rabin had to wait for some time before  the Palestinians agreed to receive his men in Tunis.</p>

			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: Better to be safe than sorry - Scheherazade Daneshkhu searches out the best places to store valuables JEWELLERY, cash and cocaine were among an estimated Pounds 40m worth of loot hauled away by thieves who broke into a London safe deposit centre in 1987. The robbery - masterminded by an Italian, Valerio Viccei, who went on to write a book about it - made a mockery of safety deposit centres. But such crimes are few and far between and, since insurance premiums on items such as jewellery can be prohibitively high, they are likely to be far safer kept in a bank than at home. Most of the high street banks provide safe custody services at their main branches but conditions and charges vary. Of the banks quoted, only Midland does not charge an 'access' fee - the amount you have to pay every time you go to inspect your box. Banks will not charge for keeping documents obtained through their services, such as a will drawn up by them or certificates for shares bought through them. You will be required to provide your own box and key but the banks do not want to know what is being kept in it. Insurance is left to the discretion of the depositor - most insurance companies will reduce their rates if you tell them that the items are being held in a bank. The services offered by Lloyds, Midland and Royal Bank of Scotland are for their own customers only. Rates given by Bank of Scotland, Midland and Lloyds include VAT. Sealed envelopes. The annual charge for holding individual certificates ranges from Pounds 5 a certificate to Pounds 15 but it is much cheaper to keep valuable documents in one envelope. Charges for an envelope, generally no bigger than A4 size, are Pounds 5 a year at National Westminster and Royal Bank of Scotland. The charges at Barclays are Pounds 5 a quarter, and Pounds 10 a year at Lloyds and TSB. Bank of Scotland charges Pounds 2 half-yearly. Midland's charge is Pounds 9.98 but there are no charges for access. Small boxes or parcels. The cost is Pounds 20 a box per year at Lloyds and NatWest and Pounds 5 a quarter at Barclays. The minimum charge at Royal Bank of Scotland is Pounds 15 a year and Pounds 8 per half-year at Bank of Scotland. Midland's fee is Pounds 19.97 a year. Larger boxes or parcels. The charge is Pounds 50 a year at Lloyds and Pounds 10 a quarter at Barclays. NatWest is cheaper, with an annual fee of Pounds 30. Bank of Scotland will charge a half-yearly fee of either Pounds 16 or Pounds 32, depending on the size of the box. The annual cost at Midland is Pounds 27.02 for a medium size box and Pounds 39.95 for larger boxes. Access. Only at the Midland will you escape fees for inspecting your box or envelope. At Royal Bank of Scotland, the charge is Pounds 3 a visit to box or sealed envelope, to a maximum of Pounds 12 for any visit. Bank of Scotland charges Pounds 2 for an inspection, and the fee at NatWest and Lloyds is Pounds 5. Barclays says access charges are at the manager's discretion. If you want more secure facilities, the Midland is able to hold items in safety deposit boxes which are built into reinforced concrete strongrooms at some of its largest branches in London, Manchester and other big cities. You need to be a customer or to have a letter of introduction from another bank. There are two locks on the box; the key to one is kept by the bank and the other by the customer. But the service does not come cheap. Charges are Pounds 67.85 a year for the smallest size of about 2in x 7in x 20in, up to Pounds 2,972.75 for what amounts to a small room (7ft x 4ft 6in x 6ft 6in). The Chancery Lane Safe Deposit Co., which owns the London Silver Vaults, boasts a pedigree dating back to 1882. Access to the vaults is past custodians in cubicles, through a series of steel doors and electronic security devices, and with the help of a password. Customers have to sign a form declaring they are not storing 'noxious substances' and are given the 'only key in the world' to their box. There are 40 different sizes of safe, with annual rental costs ranging from Pounds 42.27 to Pounds 570.30. There are no inspection charges.</p>

			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CLAREMONT SCHOOLS NAME KEELER AS  SUPERINTENDENT  </P> <P> Supt. Douglas Keeler of the Manhattan Beach City School District has been named  superintendent of the Claremont Unified School District. He expects to begin  his new $89,500-a-year job by July 1.  </P> <P> Keeler, 45, has been superintendent in the Manhattan Beach district, which has  2,200 students in kindergarten through 8th grade, since 1986.  </P> <P> Keeler, who was recruited for the Claremont post, said he is reluctant to leave  Manhattan Beach because he likes his job and there are still things to  accomplish in the district, including possible unification with school  districts in Hermosa Beach and Redondo Beach.  </P> <P> However, Keeler said the opportunity to head a 6,200-student district,  including high school grades, is too good to pass up.  </P> <P> Barbara Dunsmoor, president of the Manhattan Beach school board, said the board  regrets losing Keeler but understands that the Claremont job "is a marvelous  opportunity for him."  </P></p>

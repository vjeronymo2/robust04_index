			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> 5 CONCERTS TO AID FIRE VICTIMS  </P> <P> Singer Willie Nelson has a new cause -- the victims of a tire fire in Canada.  </P> <P> Nelson has five shows scheduled this month in Ontario province, and part of the  proceeds from them will go toward the environmental relief fund set up to help  residents of the rural community of Hagersville recover from a fire that burned  12 million tires over a three-week period.  </P> <P> Nelson, who is touring with Ricky Van Shelton and George Fox, a Canadian  country star and cattle rancher, has helped raise millions of dollars for  farmers with the Farm Aid concerts.  </P> <P> "Farming plays a big part in the economy of the area, and when Willie Nelson  and the other artists were made aware of the situation they were very anxious  to help," concert promoter Joe Owens said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the cable service Nashville Network announced today that it will  telecast Farm Aid IV live from the Hoosier Dome in Indianapolis on Saturday,  April 7. The Nashville Network will carry the first seven hours of the concert  exclusively, from 1 p.m. until 8 p.m.  </P> <P> Discussions are proceeding to have the three prime-time hours, from 8 p.m.  until 11 p.m., carried by one of the broadcast networks.  </P></p>

			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: TV stocks on bid alert Television provided a glimmer of activity in an otherwise dull London market yesterday as the government finally gave the go-ahead for mergers within the sector. Investors had expected the news last week and have been preparing themselves for a rash of bids for some time. But there was surprise over a couple of riders in the announcement which could impinge on the future of Yorkshire-Tyne Tees, Scottish and HTV. Yorkshire-Tyne Tees had been considered as a prime bid candidate, but Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage minister, said one company would only be allowed to hold two regional licences. Dealers said that, as Yorkshire-Tyne Tees TV already represented two regions, it would be protected. Consequently, the share price fell 17 to 194p. Analysts had also anticipated that the national status of the Welsh and Scottish channels would have been protected, but there was no exclusion clause in the final announcement and the possibility of bids sent HTV up 4 to 92p and Scottish 5 higher to 449p. Among the more likely bid targets, Anglia rose 8 to 436p and Central climbed 77 to 2170p.</p>

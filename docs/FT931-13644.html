			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Law Lords rule on Channel tunnel dispute THE Law Lords yesterday refused to grant Eurotunnel an injunction preventing Channel tunnel contractors from walking off the Pounds 8bn project unless they are paid more money. Transmanche Link, a consortium of five British and five French construction companies, before Christmas hinted that the opening of the project might be further delayed if agreement over payments could not be reached. The opening, originally planned for this May, has been put back until December because there will be insufficient locomotives and rolling stock to run a full service until Autumn 1994. Contractors, in a carefully worded statement in December, reminded Eurotunnel that it would require 'a strong co-operative effort' if the project was to be completed speedily. It was not clear yesterday what bearing the Law Lords' ruling would have on the contractors' actions given that they could still be sued for substantial damages if it was proved that they had breached their contract. The construction companies want Eurotunnel to improve its offer to pay an additional Pounds 1.2bn, of which Pounds 200m would be paid in some form of equity such as convertible loan stock. Eurotunnel asked the courts to grant an injunction in November 1991, after Transmanche threatened to halt work on installing a cooling system in the tunnel unless its was paid enough to cover the cost of the work. Lord Mustill ruled yesterday that the contract between Eurotunnel and Transmanche already provided a disputes procedure which had yet to be completed. This did not prohibit the granting of an injunction but the Law Lords felt this would unfairly disadvantage the contractors as any arbitration on their claim was unlikely to be resolved until long after the work had been completed.</p>

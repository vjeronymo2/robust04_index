"I hope they are not  overestimating themselves," he told a Kimberley breakfast  meeting attended by about 20 businessmen.    Mr Buthelezi said free and fair elections could not be held  amid the kind of violence experienced in Natal. Violence could  increase as the election date got closer.    He reiterated the failure of the interim constitution to  provide federalism or regional autonomy for South Africa, saying  the prognosis for a genuinely democratic government emerging  under this constitution "is not good at all". "The 1993  constitution is there to ensure the African National Congress'  battle for a central dictatorship will be easily won."    Although excluded from the April election, Mr Buthelezi said  he still hoped "sanity could prevail" and a solution could be  found so all parties could join the fold. While it was  traumatic for white Inkatha members not to vote, this was not  the case for black members "who have never voted anyway", he  said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The House of Representatives has issued a statement  on the situation in Yemen. In the statement, the House urged  members of the Yemeni House of Representatives to play an  effective role in maintaining the unity of Yemen. The statement  also appealed to the Yemenis not to resort to the use of weapons  and violence, to adhere to democratic policy, and to maintain  the language of dialogue and negotiation. Following is the text  of the statement:    With great concern and deep regret, the Jordanian House of  Representatives is following the news from fraternal Yemen on  the regrettable bloody events there, including the accompanying  problems such as the thousands of victims and the destruction of  many of the brother Yemenis' achievements, foremost of which is  Yemeni unity, the nucleus of the Arab unionist plan.    Proceeding from Arab brotherhood and from a concern for what  is good for the Arabs, as represented by Jordan's sponsorship of  the signing of the accord document and efforts to implement the  document's provisions and to achieve reconciliation, the  Jordanian House of Representatives calls on brothers in  fraternal Yemen to refrain from using weapons and violence, to  adhere to democratic policies, to maintain the dialogue and  negotiations, and to concentrate all efforts on achieving a  comprehensive development.    Moreover, the House calls on the brother members of the  Yemeni House of Representatives to play an effective and  positive role to maintain the unity of Yemen and its people's  achievements. At the same time, the Jordanian House of  Representatives announces its denunciation and condemnation of  any attempt by any party to deviate the Yemeni crisis from its  national course.</p>

			<p>930723 FT  23 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome news News that Wellcome had won a US court case to protect its patent on its top-selling anti-Aids drug Retrovir sent the shares smartly forward. The company had been challenged by a rival bio-tech company, Barr Laboratories, over which organisation owned the patent to Zidovudine, the laboratory name for Retrovir. While the positive outcome for Wellcome had been widely expected by pharmaceutical specialists, the publicity surrounding the case had been adversely affecting market sentiment. Mr Nigel Barnes at Hoare Govett commented: 'Any uncertainty over this patent challenge has now been lifted.' However, he added that Wellcome, together with the rest of the drugs sector, still faces an uncertain period ahead of the US healthcare reforms due in September. Wellcome, which yesterday also announced the retirement of its chairman on the grounds of ill-health, surged 29 to 641p in turnover of 4.9m. After several weak sessions, other healthcare stocks also bounced. Zeneca firmed 4 to 599p, as did SmithKline Beecham, to 425p. Embattled Medeva advanced 6 to 108p, and Glaxo was 13 higher at 534p on US buying.</p>

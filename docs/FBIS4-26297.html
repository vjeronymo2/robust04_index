			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wang Yong: "China Prepares to Begin Work on Gatt </F> Protocol"]    [Text] China is bracing itself for a long-awaited protocol  later this month on its re-entry into the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), according to a top Chinese official.    The draft protocol is to be submitted to the 17th session of  the Gatt Working Party on China in Geneva.    The meeting could be a watershed in the prolonged  negotiating  process if it can clinch a comprehensive draft protocol on  China's rights and obligations in the world trade body.    Gatt Director General Peter Sutherland has said the draft  protocol must be available by June if China wants to rejoin Gatt  and become a founding member of the World Trade Organization  (WTO) before January 1, 1995.    "We're pleased that at long last we will have a  comprehensive  document to work on, said Long Yongtu, Assistant Minister of the  Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation (Moftec).    "This by itself is a breakthrough in the negotiations," he  said.    China applied to rejoin Gatt in 1986, when the Uruguay Round  of Gatt talks were launched.    But a comprehensive protocol has failed to be shaped so far,  due to argument over what steps China would need to take after  re-entry.    Some Gatt members have demanded that China fulfill all Gatt  rules before rejoining the world free trade body.    But Peter Sutherland described the request as unrealistic  and  unreasonable.    A positive signal came recently when the United States  submitted its version of a draft protocol to Gatt following one  by the European Union earlier this year.    The move is described by Long as helping to clear the way  for  preparing a comprehensive text to be discussed in Geneva.    The U.S. has taken note of China's demand for a transitional  period during which it could fully meet Gatt requirements.    Long said China will try to be as flexible as possible in  the  coming rounds of negotiations.    "We will accept demands (from other Gatt members) only if  they comply with the gradual process of China's economic reforms  and its current economic level," he said.    During a round of Sino-U.S. negotiations in Washington  earlier this month, the U.S. made many requests which included  expanding Chinese market access concerning trade in services and  allowing more companies to deal in foreign trade in China.    Long said China will consider them and accept those that are  reasonable.    He insisted re-entry to Gatt is only part of China's  economic  reform plan.    And he said China wants nothing that would risk economic  development and social stability He said if Western nations come  down too hard on China, progress towards a market economy will  be disrupted.    Long praised Dorothy Dwoskin, the U.S. assistant trade  representative, and her team for their hard work in Washington  earlier this month to narrow the differences between China and  the U.S. over the terms for China's re-entry.    He said the bilateral talks were positive and constructive,  as they were free from political interference after U.S.  President Bill Clinton decided on May 26 to renew China's  most-favoured-nation status and delink it with human rights.    But Long said future difficulties may arise in the  negotiations.    "So long as we have good will and a realistic approach, we  can overcome many more difficulties," he emphasized.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Ahtisaari: Result of EU Referendum </F> Will Be Binding"]    [Text] SDP [Social Democratic Party] presidential candidate  Martti Ahtisaari considers the advisory referendum to be held on  Finland's membership in the EU (European Union) to be binding on  decisionmakers. "As I see it, the result of the referendum will  be binding on decisionmakers. As for me, I would exert my  influence as president to see to it that this is the case," he  said in Kajaani on Wednesday [8 December].    Ahtisaari quickly tried to find a comprehensive explanation  couched in plain language of the disadvantages staying out of  the EU would create for us Finns.    Ahtisaari thinks that the EU Commission's preliminary  positions on agriculture have given rise to an emotion-charged  debate and that [politicians] have also begun to play the  presidential game exploiting the agriculture issue.    "They have tried to paint a picture for citizens intimating  that the Commission's positions constitute the final result of  the negotiations. I fear that on this basis they have begun to  play the presidential game exploiting the agriculture issue  despite the fact that the real negotiations have hardly even  begun."    In Ahtisaari's opinion, Finland's membership in the EU would  be a logical continuation of the policy of opening itself up  that Finland has been pursuing since the wars. He said that  there is good reason for Finland to join the EC, but that we, of  course, require an acceptable outcome to the membership  negotiations.</p>

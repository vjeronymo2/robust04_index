			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Farmers criticise curbs on nitrate Government plans for compulsory restrictions to control nitrate pollution in drinking water have been criticised by farmers' leaders. A consultation paper yesterday proposed stricter controls on manure and fertiliser use in 72 areas, particularly affecting livestock farmers in the Midlands, the north-east and East Anglia. The Department of the Environment also announced tighter sewage treatment controls in 33 urban and 58 coastal areas of England and Wales under the 1991 European urban waste-water treatment directive. The 72 nitrate-vulnerable zones, due to take effect by the end of 1999, are to comply with the European Commission's nitrate directive, which calls for compulsory action in areas where nitrate in drinking water sources exceeds 50mg per litre at any one time. Farmers and landowners criticised the 50mg level as too strict and pointed out that the British government and the World Health Organisation had also questioned the limit. Mr Tony Pexton, National Farmers' Union vice president, said: 'We fully accept that nitrate leaching must be addressed . . . but we can only be expected to act on a sound scientific footing.' The Country Landowners' Association said farmers should be compensated if they had to take measures 'beyond sound husbandry and management'. A code of good agricultural practice was established by the government in 1991. The new controls would affect 1.6m acres - about 6 per cent of agricultural land in England and Wales. About 25,000 acres are already designated nitrate-sensitive areas where farmers voluntarily enforce even stricter measures than envisaged for nitrate-vulnerable zones and are compensated for this.</p>

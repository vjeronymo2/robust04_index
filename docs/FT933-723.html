			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Regeneration scheme opens in Bristol A Pounds 1.5m project funded by the public and private sectors was launched yesterday by Sir George Young, environment minister, to provide training and jobs in a deprived part of Bristol. Sir George described the project as one of the most ambitious of its kind and said it would help restore confidence in Hartcliffe, south Bristol - an area of high unemployment and the scene of riots last year. The Gatehouse project, which will provide a centre with enterprise workshops, training facilities, meeting rooms and a creche, was part of the city's failed bid for the government's City Challenge scheme. The Department of the Environment is providing an urban partnership grant of Pounds 500,000. The city council is donating Pounds 500,000 and providing the site for a peppercorn rent. The balance is being raised from more than 20 companies. British Telecommunications yesterday donated Pounds 100,000. The Gatehouse project is being led by Hartcliffe and Withywood Ventures, an enterprise and community development agency.</p>

			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / ANC accused over prisoners A commission of inquiry in South Africa has found that the African National Congress tortured, mistreated and in some cases killed prisoners detained in its prison camps outside South Africa in the 1980s. But it stopped short of blaming senior ANC officials for the abuses, writes Patti Waldmeir in Johannesburg. In a report released yesterday, a three-man commission appointed by ANC president Nelson Mandela echoed criticisms from an earlier internal commission of inquiry, saying that ANC security officers had beaten, tortured, detained without trial, and in some cases executed detainees. But it named only two senior ANC officials and accused them of relatively minor abuses. More serious findings were made against members of the ANC's security branch, and the commission recommends that they be disciplined under the ANC's internal code of conduct.</p>

			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: An interest in equities It must be obvious after yesterday - if it were not obvious before - that the government will not shrink from raising interest rates to defend the pound. The exact timing of any such move is anyone's guess, and will depend on how long Mr Lamont can continue calling the market's bluff. The question for investors is whether an increase in rates is already reflected in the price of shares. Equities are probably braced for a rise approaching 1 percentage point in the next few weeks. Prices might dip on any such announcement, but if a single rate rise and intervention turned out to be enough to lift sterling off its ERM floor and hold it stable, equities could conceivably rally. The risk is that one rate rise might not be enough. If sterling were still under pressure, rates mights have to rise again, in which case earning prospects would be really squeezed. History suggests that it can take more than a single interest rate rise to smother a full blown sterling crisis. With another lurch in the dollar or further anti-Maastricht French opinion polls still a real possibility, there are more uncomfortable days to come. The current clash is primarily between a strong mark and a weak dollar, and sterling - along with other ERM currencies such as the franc and the lira - is caught up in the backwash. That is not a position from which it is sensible to make short-term decisions.</p>

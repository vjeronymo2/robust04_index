			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Ziyad Abu-Zayyad, "spokesman for </F> the Palestinian leadership," by Rafi Rosenfeld; place not given;  from the "It Is All Talk" program -- live]    [Text] [Rosenfeld] In connection with the Peres letter,  the Israelis feel that 'Arafat made a mountain out of a  molehill. The government is claiming that the letter merely  guarantees the status quo of the Jerusalem institutions and  nothing more. What do you say?    [Abu-Zayyad] I say that you have nothing better to do than  make mountains out of molehills. The truth is that I am  surprised at both the Israeli media and the Israeli politicians'  preoccupation with this matter. I think Jerusalem is a very  sensitive issue, and the constant discussion of it merely serves  to complicate it and incite the sides against each other.  Therefore, I think we -- both sides -- should drop the issue.  In my opinion, the Palestinians should stop making political  statements about Jerusalem, and the Israelis should do the same.  At the same time, the closure should be lifted gradually,  because what is inciting the Palestinians is the continued  closure and the suffering to which the Arabs have been subjected  in the context of Jerusalem.    [Rosenfeld] Your remarks imply a great affinity between the  Israeli Government and the Palestinian leadership on the issue  of Jerusalem. Could this affinity be the result of some other  secret addenda?    [Abu-Zayyad] Listen, as far as I know, there are no secret  addenda. I have noticed that the Israeli opposition has been  trying to attack the government and turn the Israeli people  against the government and the peace process. All those who  support the peace process and desire peace should be  sufficiently alert to distinguish between malicious  pronouncements intended to agitate and those made sincerely.    [Rosenfeld] Ziyad Abu-Zayyad, there is one point I would  like to clarify with you. We heard this morning that the  Palestinian leaders have a copy of the letter to the Norwegian  foreign minister, but with one difference: Your copy is dated  one month earlier than the one that was sent to Foreign Minister  Holst.    [Abu-Zayyad] First of all, although I know a lot and am  involved in many facets of Palestinian politics, I have neither  seen nor heard about such a letter. I do not know where you  obtained your information about the letter in 'Arafat's  possession.    [Rosenfeld] It was reported on the radio this morning.    [Abu-Zayyad] Listen, Israeli radio and press publish lots of  unsubstantiated and unfounded reports.    [Rosenfeld] Are you saying that although you have not seen  it, it may exist?    [Abu-Zayyad] My not having seen it does not mean that it  does not exist, but what I am telling you is that we must treat  press and radio reports cautiously, because there are many  unfounded reports.    [Rosenfeld] Now to two ostensibly technical questions.  Peres said this morning that if the Palestinians conduct  Palestinian affairs from Orient House in East Jerusalem, the  place will be closed. Are you conducting autonomy affairs from  there?    [Abu-Zayyad] Orient House was launched as part of the  overall peace process, and it will continue to operate in that  capacity.    [Rosenfeld] I do not understand. Are you saying that  Palestinian autonomy matters will be run from there?    [Abu-Zayyad] No, definitely not. I do not see how you could  have understood that. As I told you, Orient House started  operating right after the Madrid Conference within the broad  framework of the peace process. It does not belong in the  autonomy, it is not part of the autonomy, and its offices are  not autonomy offices. Orient House will continue to operate as  it did before the Gaza-Jericho agreement, and it will continue  to operate even after the Gaza- Jericho agreement is  implemented. Now, the Gaza-Jericho agreement stipulates that  the central Gaza-Jericho authority will be in Jericho, and there  is no argument about that. Thus, the Palestinian self-rule  institutions that will be established in Gaza and Jericho will  naturally be situated in Gaza and Jericho.    [Rosenfeld] I have another technical question, Ziyad  Abu-Zayyad. Minister Shahal said this morning that if any  security officers operate in East Jerusalem, they will be  detained. Are there any such officers?    [Abu-Zayyad] There are none. To put it briefly and  unequivocally: There are no Palestinian security officers in  East Jerusalem. There are security guards situated inside  Orient House, and their work is connected solely to Orient  House. They are under clear, unequivocal orders precluding  their operation outside Orient House. You may see one of them  still wearing his clothes with an Orient House emblem on his way  home, but it does not mean that he is on duty or that he is  patrolling the area or on duty. We are fully aware of the legal  aspects of the activity of these people, and they will not  attempt to exceed the limits of their authority.    [Rosenfeld] Thank you very much, Ziyad Abu-Zayyad.</p>

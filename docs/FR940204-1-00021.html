			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To prepare the Systemwide combined financial statements and related discussions and analyses, the Funding Corporation relies on financial data and narratives furnished by the banks. To provide further assurance that the banks' submissions to the Funding Corporation are accurate and complete, proposed &sect;630.6(b) would require that each bank establish and maintain a bank audit committee to oversee the internal controls over the bank's accounting and financial reporting. The proposed requirements of composition, membership qualifications, and responsibilities of the bank audit committee are similar to those of the System Audit Committee described above. A System bank whose audit committee is comprised of members of the entire board would meet the composition requirement of proposed &sect;630.6(b)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since most System banks have performed this oversight function either through a subcommittee of the board or through the full board acting as an audit committee, the FCA does not view proposed &sect;630.6(b) as a burdensome requirement. The audit committee requirement is consistent with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA), which imposes a similar requirement on insured depository institutions with total assets of $500 million or more.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Subpart B_Annual Report to Investors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed &sect;630.20 prescribes the contents of the annual report to investors. Each disclosure entity would be required to provide the information called for by this subpart, along with any supporting information, to the Funding Corporation. Information required by the proposed regulation is generally consistent with the information currently presented in the Information Statement, which should minimize any burden that may be imposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed content requirements resemble those of the annual report to shareholders under &sect;620.5 of this chapter. Under proposed &sect;630.20(a), the report would be required to provide a description of: (1) The System's business, including the System's organizational structure, geographical area, and customers; (2) the types of lending activities engaged in and financial activities offered by System institutions; (3) significant developments affecting the System's organizational structure and the manner of conducting business; (4) acquisition or disposition of material assets; and (5) concentrations of total assets (10 percent or more) in particular types of agricultural activity or business. The report must also include the address of the headquarters of each disclosure entity and service organization of the System.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;630.20(b) would require that the report provide a description of the regulatory and enforcement authority of the FCA, and the role and authority of the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation (FCSIC) and the Financial Assistance Corporation. With respect to the FCSIC, proposed &sect;630.20(b)(2) would require that the report provide a description of the FCSIC's status as a Government corporation and its role in ensuring the timely payment of principal and interest on FCS debt obligations and providing assistance to System institutions. In addition, a statement that System institutions have no control over the management of the FCSIC or expenditures from the Insurance Fund would be required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;630.20(c) would require a description of System institutions' material pending legal proceedings and a summary of the types of and reasons for enforcement actions in effect during the year. Similar information is currently disclosed to shareholders by banks and their related associations under &sect;620.5(c) of this chapter. Therefore, the banks would be required to submit such information regarding their related associations to the Funding Corporation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;630.20(d) would require that the report describe the System's funding mechanism, including System banks' authority to issue debt obligations, and the types and characteristics of debt securities issued. Proposed &sect;630.20(d)(1) would require that the report provide a disclosure regarding debt obligations that may be issued by each bank. Accordingly, the disclosure would include a description of banks' authority to issue notes, bonds, debentures, or other obligations individually under section 4.2 (a), (b), or (e) of the 1971 Act and the fact that such debt obligations are not entitled to the benefits of insurance provided by the FCSIC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

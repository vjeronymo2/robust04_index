			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / The Japanese Economic Package: Dollars 5bn boost to imports in next 18 months IMPORT promotion measures in the Japanese government's economic package will boost shipments of foreign goods to Japan by up to Dollars 5bn (Pounds 2.52bn) in the next year and a half, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) estimated last night. Mr Yoshinobu Nisaka, director of Miti's import division, solemnly said the country's swollen trade surplus meant that 'every day, day in and day out, painful days continue' for his ministry. But yesterday's measures will do little more than scratch the surface of a trade surplus set to exceed Dollars 100bn this year. The surplus has grown largely because of a fall-off in imports as Japanese industry has cut equipment purchases and as consumer ardour for high-priced European or US goods has cooled. US trade officials in Tokyo said Washington had pressed for an import component to the package, including an explicitly international procurement policy by the Japanese government in supplying public sector needs. This followed reports that the Bush administration had sent a diplomatic note reminding Japan of its commitments under the bilateral Structural Impediments Initiative, and seeking state purchases of US-made computers and other products. Some such provisions were included yesterday, after what was said to have been a tussle between Miti and the Japanese Finance Ministry, which tried to hold down the size of the package and was, anyway, more concerned about the domestic economy. Mr Nisaka denied their eventual inclusion was in response to US pressure, while adding that reflation of the economy which the package aimed to achieve would inevitably generate increased imports. 'However, we were aware that this will take time, so we wanted to incorporate some direct measures,' he said. The government is allocating just Dollars 250m in additional funds to procure foreign goods - mainly experimental, research and medical equipment. The country's import infrastructure is to be improved through an unspecified level of extra investment in ports and airports, and a more streamlined bonding system for cargo. Interest rates on state-backed trade credits and facilities investment loans are to be eased, by a half percentage point in the case of the Japan Development Bank.</p>

			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / France backs Bedie in Ivory Coast Mr Henri Konan Bedie, the self-proclaimed new president of the Ivory Coast, consolidated his grip on power yesterday after winning the endorsement of France and other diplomatic missions in the capital, Abidjan. Mr Bedie, the speaker of parliament, declared himself president a few hours after the announcement of President Felix Houphouet-Boigny's death on Tuesday. Under the constitution, he is entitled to lead the nation until the end of the presidential term in 1995. French President Francois Mitterrand addressed his message of condolence to Mr Bedie as 'interim president', indicating that France rejected the rival claim to the presidency by Mr Alassane Ouattara, prime minister. In the final weeks of Mr Houphouet-Boigny's life, the prime minister had tried to canvass support for a broad-based coalition government led by himself. Mr Ouattara and Mr Bedie are bitter rivals in the ruling Democratic Party (PDCI). They belong to different tribes and different religions, but are probably less apart on economic policy issues than their rhetoric would suggest. Mr Bedie is a former finance minister while Mr Ouattara, a former director of the International Monetary Fund, had been the Ivory Coast's economic overlord since 1990. Ambassadors in Abidjan, however, feared Mr Ouattara's plans would unleash a constitutional crisis at a time of great political and social uncertainty. They were afraid political infighting might provoke a military coup, and therefore threw their diplomatic weight behind Mr Bedie, the legal dauphin. Mr Bedie's move will probably trigger a split in the PDCI. Mr Ouattara is expected to resign as prime minister, as he had said in the past that he would not serve under Mr Bedie.</p>

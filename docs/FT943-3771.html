			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Exports fuelling Czech growth The Czech Republic has virtually completed the most ambitious mass privatisation programme in the former communist bloc and has embarked upon export-led economic growth. But painful restructuring of the newly privatised companies still lies ahead and the economy requires more foreign direct investment to penetrate new markets, Mr Vladimir Dlouhy, the minister for trade and industry said yesterday. Addressing a Confederation of British Industry conference in London, Mr Dlouhy said the government now forecast a 2-3 per cent rise in the gross domestic product this year, fuelled by rapid growth in service industries and an upturn in industrial output. Production from Czech factories plummeted 24 per cent with the collapse of Comecon markets and the start of market reforms in 1991. But industrial output was up 1.2 per cent in the first seven months of this year and in July was 4.2 higher than a year earlier. Growth was export-led, spurred by recovery in the German market which takes around 40 per cent of Czech exports and is the main source of foreign capital. Mr Dlouhy identified the combination of the Czech Republic's high skill/low wage costs and undervalued currency as the economy's main assets. But he warned that these were essentially short term advantages which would be eroded over time as living standards rose and the government moved towards full convertibility of the Czech koruna. Until now policy makers had concentrated on creating macro-economic stability rather than growth, and the results can be seen in a balanced budget, expected single digit inflation this year and low foreign debt of Dollars 9bn largely offset by the Dollars 6bn held in reserve by the central bank and commercial banking system, he said. Structural reforms have been an integral part of macro-economic stabilisation, including banking system reform and mass privatisation. Mr Roman Ceska, chairman of the national property fund said that the government expects to receive a total of CKs240bn (Pounds 5.5bn) from privatisation and has taken in CKs60bn to date. 'By the start of next year around 80 per cent of the economy will be privatised. Investment opportunities for foreign investors are now concentrated among the ranks of the recently privatised companies,' he said. Shares can be bought through the Prague stock exchange or the electronic RM small shareholder dealing system, but bigger parcels of shares can be obtained from the new investment funds which also manage many of the newly privatised companies and exercise corporate governance, he added.</p>

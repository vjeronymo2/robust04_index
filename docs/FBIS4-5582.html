			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 12 (YONHAP) -- U.S. Ambassador to Seoul  James Laney complained Tuesday that South Korea is only playing  up the negative side of the Uruguay Round [UR] trade accord,  ignoring its positive effects. Laney also said the United States  has no intention of using Section 301 of the Omnibus Trade Bill  against South Korea. The recent resurrection of the "Super 301"  provision was aimed at Japan, he said. Washington will not apply  Super 301 against Seoul since the U.S. trade deficit with South  Korea is not as large as that with Japan, Laney added.    "The Uruguay Round means that world markets are open to  Korea, not just that Korean markets are open to the world,"  Laney said in a speech to a breakfast meeting of leading  industrial managers sponsored by the International Management  Institute, an affiliate of the Federation of Korean Industries.    The most important open door for Korea, in fact, is the  Uruguay Round, Laney said. "Yet I read in the papers... that the  round is a loss for Korea -- that countermeasures' have to be  devised to limit the damage imposed from abroad," notably the  United States, he said. Under the Uruguay Round, however, Korea  does not have to climb high tariff walls in other countries, he  said. Korean products, which are excellent, will compete even  more effectively in the world market.    The Uruguay Round hasn't sounded the death knell for farming  in Korea, Laney insisted. The farming population has already  declined 50 percent in one generation. "That's not something the  United States has forced upon Korea. It's already been  happening for 30 years." Open markets mean more investment and  more technology for Korea, Laney went on. Korea is already one  of the world's largest beneficiaries of free trade, and will  continue to reap gains in the future. The ambassador said,  "trade and openness mean that Korea has come of age. Korea is  no longer weak and poor. It is one of the 15 largest economies  in the world -- larger than most of the countries in Europe."    The United States is proud of its relationship with Korea,  proud of its military and commercial alliance, Laney said. "But  we are not in alliance to exploit each other, to take unfair  advantage, but to find ways that we can grow together in more  prosperous freedom."</p>

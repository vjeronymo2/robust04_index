			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Aegis issues warning and plans further cost cuts AEGIS, the media planning and buying group, said that it would pass its final dividend for 1992, following a review of its financial position and the likelihood of European trading conditions remaining difficult in 1993. It also stated that it expected 'trading profits both in the current year and in 1993 to be below the level of 1991'. Aegis plans to reduce annual operating costs by Pounds 17m in 1993, in addition to cuts of Pounds 15m announced earlier this year. Staff levels will shrink from 1,900 to 1,650 and in a number of European countries offices will be consolidated. Operating costs in 1991 were Pounds 55m, and forecasts for 1992 were Pounds 50m. For 1993 analysts are now forecasting costs of about Pounds 30m. The company said the cost-cutting was a necessary step in the light of the probable passing into law of French legislative proposals known as the Loi Sapin. In the advertising sector the Loi Sapin threatens to curtail the levels of commission obtained by media buyers from their trading in advertising space with media owners. . When details of the Loi Sapin leaked in June, Aegis dismissed suggestions that it would severely affect its business. However, other agencies have predicted revenue losses of up to 25 per cent, a figure Aegis now accepts is not exaggerated. Analysts expect that pre-tax profits for 1992 could fall to Pounds 40m (Pounds 55.1m).</p>

			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Survey of Yorkshire and Humberside (8) Financial sector takes off - Regional strength is reflected in professional services industry YORKSHIRE and Humberside have a thriving new industry which has grown rapidly in the past eight years. Mr Richard Wilson, joint senior partner of Gordons Wright &amp; Wright, a Bradford solicitor, sums up why. 'It is the M62 which has made the difference, together with the network of roads feeding into it,' he says. 'The north can now operate as a business centre regardless of London. In the past it was harder to get about locally and all road and rail networks converged on London like a spider's web. People went there for everything.' The new industry is in financial and professional services. The base for it already existed, but was fragmented. It came together in the 1980s, about 10 years after the M62's completion, at a time when London prices were upwardly mobile. By 1987, more and more companies were using local firms, even if they kept the names of some London firms in their annual accounts for prestige reasons. London was expensive and its firms were becoming big and anonymous. Yorkshire corporate leaders were not serviced by the top partners and often not even by the same junior one on successive visits to the capital. Only merchant banking was in local short supply. Mr Alan Bottomley, senior partner of what was then AV Hammond, another firm of Bradford solicitors, was one of the first senior West Yorkshire professionals to demand that solitary London merchant bankers get on the train to Bradford, where all the other professionals associated with a deal could gather in half an hour, rather than the locals taking a mob-handed journey in the opposite direction. A lot has happened since. AV Hammond broke out of Bradford and is now Hammond Suddards, one of the Leeds 'big five'. All five are all in the top 10 law firms by size outside London and their combined critical mass is one of the reasons why Leeds now enjoys a reputation as Britain's most significant legal centre after the capital. In 1987, three of the others - Booth &amp; Co, Hepworth &amp; Chadwick and Simpson Curtis - boasted they employed 500 people between them. It is double that now. The fifth, Dibb Lupton, has since joined forces with Broomhead, the Sheffield leader, and added the Manchester-based Priors, to create a powerful empire straddling the Pennines and Peaks. London offices, coupled in some cases with links to similar corporate law firms in other large cities, mean that all now compete in the national market. Size and spread, however, are not prerequisites for success. Brooke, North and Goodwin manages with 'only' 11 partners and 60 staff in Leeds but has only half its work in Yorkshire and Humberside. Mr Michael Goodwin says size may attract some big clients but all clients want value for money and quality. Leeds legal partners cost half London levels, an important selling point, but what about local competition? 'Although we are competitors and would each like to do all the work available, we recognise the strength of acting together through the Leeds finance forum,' says Mr Martin Shaw, managing partner of Simpson Curtis. Mr Peter Smart of Walker Morris, however, says: 'The issue is not so much costs as accessibility. We are acting for Kalon in their bid for Manders and can get to the company in about 15 minutes.' Walker Morris, a solicitor employing under 200 people in 1988, has often been in the shadow of the big five from a publicity point of view, but has just got on with it. It now has 25 partners with an average age of about 35, a total complement of around 300 and is still growing and recruiting. 'It's only just coming home to London firms that Leeds is a major force,' Mr Smart says. 'We are not competing so much for London's international work, but within the UK, and the north in particular, where companies have decided they don't want to go to London any more for their services.' He believes an important transformation is under way in Leeds, with clients becoming more selective and picking specialists outside their main advisers for specific jobs. This applies to all professions. A company might, for example, use one of the big six national accountants for its audit, but another for tax work and yet another for some specialised consultancy. Mr Smart believes this keeps advisers on their toes - making them offer keener prices to bread-and-butter clients - while providing the chance to prospect for a wider range of business from a temporary client for a specialised service. He also says the rise of Leeds has been noticed abroad: when overseas companies now do business in the north, they no longer turn automatically to London. For example, Walker Morris acts for Netto, the Netherlands retailer, which is expanding in the north. Mr Gordon Horsfield of Price Waterhouse, the accountants, agrees that the use of second advisers for specialist functions is growing. PW, which employs 320 in Leeds, audits 11 of the 50 largest quoted companies in the region but does other work for another nine. 'There is a growing transactional basis for buying services and less one-stop shopping,' he says. Peat Marwick, which also audits 11 of the top 50, has a similar spread of specialists on offer. Mr Ralph Preece, partner-in-charge of corporate special services at Touche Ross, sees considerable opportunities arising as the recession ends. 'There is a growing realisation by the banks that you can't look at businesses in terms of fixed assets. 'A company's major asset comes in at eight, goes home at seven and is on site 365 days a year. Bank managers are not skilled at evaluating such people. We are. We have seen a lot of corporate failure and corporate success. We will do that work. We are doing a lot already.' This is crucial work, because there is a shortage of debt. However, one thing that will probably never be in short supply in Yorkshire and Humberside is equity finance. Where few venture capitalists ventured in the early 1980s, a dozen now compete. The regional network of professionals helps them greatly. All the big accountants have active corporate finance departments and the lawyers have plenty of dealmakers. Merchant banking and development capital services are on hand at County NatWest, Lloyds, Singer &amp; Friedlander and NM Rothschild. Henry Cooke and BWD Rensburg offer a range of services from stockbroking to corporate finance. All stand ready to compete with each other - or combine to get a piece of any syndicated action if they cannot win outright or the deal is too big for them. Good businesses on the lookout for capital do not have to look for long. Deals can be done in an afternoon because most offices are walking distance from each other. Mr David Wilkinson, the 3i director for the region, says his three offices in Leeds, Hull and Sheffield did 56 deals last year - exactly the same number as in the preceding 12 months, but Pounds 29m was invested, against Pounds 18m in 1990. 'The trend is continuing this year. We have put about Pounds 150m into our Yorkshire and Humberside portfolio. Of course there is a recession but there are plenty of opportunities to invest in some good, solid businesses.' It is this, the local market, that has spawned Leeds' new professional service sector. It does not appear much damaged by the recession. This must say something about the underlying strength of the regional economy.</p>

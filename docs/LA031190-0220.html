			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ONLY THE LAWYERS ARE SURE TO WIN IN LINCOLN WARS;  </P> <P> THRIFTS: TWENTY-FOUR LAWSUITS AND NEARLY AS MANY INVESTIGATIONS ARE EXPECTED TO  KEEP PROSECUTORS AND LAWYERS BUSY FOR YEARS.  </P> <P> A courtroom full of lawyers had gathered for their weekly meeting in Phoenix a  few months ago to go over some legal matters in the bankruptcy of American  Continental Corp., parent of the failed Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine.  </P> <P> Ronald E. Warnicke, a Phoenix lawyer who was appointed an examiner in  bankruptcy, contended that the way the company's chairman, Charles H. Keating  Jr., was spending money to fight federal thrift regulators, there soon would be  no money left for creditors.  </P> <P> The accusation prompted U.S. District Judge Richard M. Bilby to warn the  lawyers about the vast amount of litigation and investigations involving  Lincoln, which could become the biggest thrift bailout in history with a  $2-billion bill to taxpayers.  </P> <P> "I would hate for this case's epitaph five years from now to be that the public  lost, the regulators lost, American Continental lost, the creditors lost, Mr.  Keating lost -- but the lawyers got rich," Judge Bilby said.  </P> <P> Indeed, the lawyers are doing well. Lincoln is arguably the most investigated  financial institution in the nation's history. To date, at least seven state  and federal agencies are investigating possible criminal wrongdoing. In  addition, small investors and government authorities have filed at least 24  major civil lawsuits seeking millions of dollars in damages from Keating and  his top executives.  </P> <P> "I can't imagine anyone being more investigated," said Donald Gaffney, a  Phoenix lawyer for a bankruptcy committee of unsecured American Continental  creditors. "Other than the CIA, everyone's investigating Lincoln."  </P> <P> The web of investigations and lawsuits will take years to untangle. Much of the  effort may be for naught. Keating and his corporate executives have claimed in  court documents that they're out of money, making any recovery of claims  against them questionable.  </P> <P> American Continental, which has worked with more than 75 law firms in the last  few years, is paying its army of lawyers more than $1 million a month to battle  regulators and other litigants and to bring the company out of bankruptcy. And  the government is estimated to be spending twice that on its hired hands in an  all-out war to put Keating and his cohorts totally out of business and behind  bars.  </P> <P> Much of the spending appears to be unnecessary because of duplicative efforts.  Federal authorities, for instance, are not sharing information with state  investigators or other parties who are on the same side. And state authorities,  Gaffney said, appear to be going over the same ground that federal  investigators and others already have covered.  </P> <P> Keating and American Continental have helped run up the bills by filing several  lawsuits against regulators as well. The company has challenged the federal  seizure of Lincoln last year. U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin has been  hearing testimony over the last several months.  </P> <P> While the Lincoln collapse is a boon to lawyers, Gaffney quips that the big  winners are paper manufacturers.  </P> <P> A document depository was created in Phoenix to maintain the originals of all  documents filed by American Continental, Lincoln, federal regulators, several  accounting firms and others. The depository has more than 20 million pages of  documents in some 10,000 boxes, which, if set end to end, would create a Great  Wall of Lincoln -- a foot-wide, foot-high mound of paper stretching for nearly  four miles.  </P> <P> "You can read from now until your demise and still not read everything," said  John Quinn of Los Angeles, a lawyer for Keating and his family. "I've never  seen anything like this."  </P> <P> But there's a reason for all the paper, beyond the fact that fraud cases  typically include a large amount of documents.  </P> <P> "This is the financial scandal of our age," said William S. Lerach of San  Diego, one of the lawyers in 17 lawsuits brought by small investors who bought  American Continental debt securities.  </P> <P> David B. Gold of San Francisco, another plaintiffs lawyer, points out that the  litigation involves more than just the loss of $250 million to more than 23,000  debt holders. The civil suits include charges of improper political pressure by  Keating and his company.  </P> <P> "This case goes to the very essence of the way our government works," Gold  said. "If political pressure is going to be put on our regulators, it  undermines the function of government."  </P> <P> Before American Continental filed for bankruptcy last April 13 and regulators  seized Lincoln the next day, Keating wielded great influence among politicians.  He and his family and business executives, as well as his company, contributed  more than $1.7 million to about three dozen state and federal politicians or  their causes. And he frequently called officeholders to express his views on  thrift law regulation.  </P> <P> His group spent most of its money -- more than $1.3 million -- on five  influential U.S. senators, including Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), who raised more  than $900,000 from the Keating group, mostly for voter registration groups the  senator supported.  </P> <P> When Keating had trouble with regulators over an unusually long federal audit  of Lincoln in early 1987, he called on the five senators to help end the audit.  The Keating Five, as they now are known, held two meetings with regulators, who  have since claimed the senators pressured them and sought to make a deal for  Keating.  </P> <P> The senators have vehemently denied applying pressure or seeking any deal and  have called for some of the investigations that now are part of the litigation  landscape.  </P> <P> Cranston, for instance, had asked the General Accounting Office to look into  ways to get money back to the American Continental debt holders but the GAO  declined to act, citing ongoing litigation elsewhere. Some Keating Five  senators, such as John McCain (R-Ariz.), were among those who asked the Federal  Elections Commission to look into possible campaign law violations on the part  of himself and the other senators.  </P> <P> Meantime, the Senate Ethics Committee is probing their contacts with federal  thrift regulators on behalf of Lincoln. The senators have vigorously defended  their actions in that forum.  </P> <P> The pending litigation and investigations come from three groups: federal  authorities, state agencies and creditors, primarily debt holders. Most of the  small investors were part of a group that bought the biggest chunk of debt  securities, or bonds -- nearly $200 million worth -- at Lincoln's 29 Southern  California branches.  </P> <P> James J. Feder of Los Angeles, a lawyer for American Continental, admits that  his client has its share of legal problems, particularly the $250 million in  class-action claims from bondholders. But he said the case does not rival the  problems caused by some previous bank failures.  </P> <P> "While that's a lot of money, it's not in the range or involves the complexity  of cases like Penn Square or Continental Illinois," he said.  </P> <P> Penn Square National Bank in Oklahoma City, Okla., failed in 1982 because of  bad energy loans, causing millions of dollars of losses at other banks and  resulting in criminal convictions for fraud. Continental Illinois National Bank  in Chicago was the first major federal bailout of a bank as regulators put $4.5  billion into it in 1984 and took an ownership position, which they subsequently  sold. Neither bank action, however, carried the political overtones involved in  the Lincoln case.  </P> <P> The list of pending lawsuits against Keating and others includes a recent civil  action filed by the California Department of Corporations, a suit many lawyers  involved in the massive amount of litigation say is inadequate and  hypocritical. Bondholders have sued the agency in some of their class-action  suits, accusing it of wrongly approving the bond sales when there was clear  evidence that American Continental couldn't repay the debt.  </P> <P> "The Corporations Department sued three people who claim not to have any money  at all and almost negligently failed to go after those who are just as culpable  and have money," said Joseph W. Cotchett of Burlingame, another bondholder  lawyer. "They manifest a complete lack of understanding of what happened."  </P> <P> The bondholders are looking to recover from the professionals -- accountants  and lawyers -- who advised Keating, as well as from insurance carriers for  Keating, his lawyers and his accountants.  </P> <P> The list of pending investigations against Keating and his executives includes  Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner's call for a special state grand jury  to investigate the possibility of criminal wrongdoing, an action some lawyers  think might help but others call superfluous and politically motivated.  </P> <P> Reiner, acting as a special state attorney general, may be able to move faster  than federal authorities and secure a conviction that could help the bondholder  cases move more quickly, Cotchett said. But plaintiffs lawyer David B. Gold  said the investigation covers the same area that federal officials are probing  and charged that Reiner's only motivation is political. A Democrat, Reiner is  running for state attorney general and wants to reach as high as possible into  Deukmejian's Republican Administration for wrongdoers, Gold claims. Reiner  denies the charge.  </P> <P> Orange County Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi, invited to join the state  investigation, said he declined because his office has "too many cases to spend  our resources on without duplicating what another agency has done." He gave the  federal task force two county investigators and will supply staff lawyers if  needed.  </P> <P> Capizzi, a Republican, said his decision was nonpartisan and based on the best  interests of the investigation, the victims and the taxpayers.  </P> <P> Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, a Democrat who is running for governor, has  been criticized for playing politics with the Lincoln case. Caught between his  dual role of defending state officials and prosecuting state fraud cases, he  did nothing through last summer, then appeared to flip-flop between  investigating Lincoln and defending the state.  </P> <P> In December, he decided to pass the criminal investigation off to Reiner and  Sacramento County Dist. Atty. Steve White, a former Van de Kamp aide. The  attorney general also decided to launch a separate civil investigation while  defending the state against bondholder litigation. This litigation alleged  negligence on the part of the Corporations Department for approving the debt  sales when the agency knew American Continental could not repay the debt.  </P> <P> A month later, Van de Kamp decided that state officials had to get their own  lawyers, at state expense, because his office would have a conflict of interest  in investigating securities improprieties while representing the state agency  that may have wrongly approved the securities sales.  </P> <P> Corporations Commissioner Christine Bender was fuming. She charged that Van de  Kamp was abandoning his clients and that he already had an attorney-client  relationship with them. Worse, she said, he was withdrawing when the state had  a vital interest in any statements she made in upcoming depositions in the  bondholder litigation because her comments could bind the state and make it  liable. She termed his conflicts argument a "thin excuse."  </P> <P> Bondholder lawyers said she "stonewalled" the questioning at her deposition on  Thursday, giving them little information. Bender could not be reached for  comment.  </P> <P> Meantime, bondholder lawyers have been jockeying among themselves for positions  of leadership, positions that will pay them huge sums should the lawsuits  recover the money they expect.  </P> <P> "In my opinion, it's going to result in one of the largest class-action  recoveries in history," bondholder lawyer Lerach said.  </P> <P> Defense lawyers such as American Continental's James Feder said they've never  seen such infighting among plaintiffs lawyers for the job of lead counsel.  Cotchett's attempt in December to freeze Keating's assets and revelations that  Lerach hosted a fund-raiser for Cranston in December were really efforts to  take control of the cases, defense lawyers said.  </P> <P> Cotchett, Lerach and other plaintiffs lawyers, though, say they've been working  together amazingly well -- so well, Lerach said, that he and Cotchett were  recently named co-lead counsel in the federal litigation in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> But now Gold, the San Francisco lawyer, has filed a bondholder suit in federal  court in Phoenix and has asked for a consolidation of cases there in what most  plaintiffs and defense lawyers see as a bold attempt to join as co-lead  counsel. The Lerach-Cotchett group filed papers opposing any move out of Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> "Gold is not going to be co-lead counsel," Lerach said. "He filed his suit late  and he went by himself to a jurisdiction where no one else filed. The odds of  the cases being transferred out of Los Angeles are very remote."  </P> <P> LINCOLN'S LEGACY OF LEGAL ACTION  </P> <P> MAJOR PENDING LITIGATION  </P> <P> Lincoln's Parent Looks for Safe Harbor: American Continental Corp. in Phoenix,  unable to sell Irvine-based Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, files a bankruptcy  petition April 13, 1989, to protect itself from creditors while it tries to  reorganize under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws. Federal regulators  seize Lincoln the next day.  </P> <P> Regulators Seek Funds in Bankruptcy: Federal regulators file a claim against  American Continental in Bankruptcy Court to recover losses at Lincoln that were  allegedly caused by the parent firm. Regulators predict the bailout of Lincoln  will amount to $2 billion, the costliest thrift rescue ever.  </P> <P> American Continental Fights Back: Lincoln's parent files three lawsuits against  regulators. One challenges the takeover of Lincoln. A second seeks $500 million  for wrongful taking of property. And a third seeks $200 million for leaking  confidential financial information -- much of it allegedly erroneous -- that  harmed the S&amp;L. The company dropped the leaks suit last week under court  pressure to curtail legal expenses.  </P> <P> Bondholders Seek $250 Million: About 23,000 holders of five different issues of  American Continental's unrated, uninsured debt securities file 17 lawsuits in  state and federal courts in California and in federal court in Arizona. They  allege fraud, misrepresentation and racketeering against American Continental  executives and their lawyers and accountants. The biggest block of plaintiffs,  nearly 22,000, bought almost $200 million of the lowest-grade securities mostly  at Lincoln's 29 Southern California branches.  </P> <P> RTC Files Racketeering Suit: The Resolution Trust Corp., which manages failed  savings and loans, files suit accusing seven American Continental executives of  racketeering and 20 directors, officers and spouses of fraud. The suit seeks  $1.1 billion.  </P> <P> Insurers Sue to Abandon Keating: Three insurers covering American Continental  Chairman Charles H. Keating Jr. and other officers and directors for their  corporate actions refuse to defend the executives and sue for a court order  saying they don't have to pay defense costs or any judgments. Keating sues a  fourth insurer for refusing to honor a similar policy.  </P> <P> State Dept. of Corporations Sues: Christine W. Bender, who as the agency's  commissioner initially approved the Lincoln bond sales, files a state  securities fraud suit seeking restitution for the 22,000 debt holders and an  injunction against three American Continental executives to prevent further  violations of securities laws.  </P> <P> Pontchartrain Investor Sues Insiders: An investor in the Pontchartrain Hotel  Limited Partnership, which owned the downtown hotel, contends in his suit filed  in federal court in Detroit that American Continental insiders are liable for  securities fraud in their marketing of partnership shares. Insiders held a  majority interest in the hotel, which the partnership bought from Lincoln.  </P> <P> PENDING CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS  </P> <P> Joint Task Force Launches Probe: A joint task force including the FBI, the U.S.  attorney's office and the Orange County district attorney's office is working  with a federal grand jury in Los Angeles on three separate probes. They are  investigating allegations of general bank fraud, securities violations and  illegal political contributions.  </P> <P> D.A. Asks for Special Grand Jury: Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner,  acting for state Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp, wins Superior Court authorization  to empanel a special state grand jury to investigate primarily any wrongdoing  in the sale of debt securities in Lincoln's branches. He expects to have jurors  in place by mid-April and to complete his investigation in six to nine months.  </P> <P> Corporations Dept. Seeks D.A. Probes: The state agency asks the district  attorneys in Los Angeles and Orange counties to investigate possible criminal  violations of state securities laws. The request is handled as part of on-going  investigations.  </P> <P> SEC Continues to Investigate: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has  been investigating American Continental for more than three years on a variety  of disclosure and other securities law matters. Long quiet, the investigation  has heated up recently with new subpoenas issued to Keating and his family. The  SEC is empowered to bring either criminal charges or civil lawsuits.  </P> <P> PENDING CIVIL INVESTIGATIONS  </P> <P> FEC Checks Possible Election Law Wrongs: After revelations about Keating's  support of three dozen politicians, particularly five U.S. senators, the  Federal Elections Commission launches a probe into possible election law  violations, including allegations that Keating contributed funds to campaigns  in return for favors for Lincoln. The five senators, including Sen. Alan  Cranston (D-Calif.), deny such claims.  </P> <P> U.S. House Committee Broadens Scope: The U.S. House Banking, Finance and Urban  Affairs Committee, after making a series of disclosures about Lincoln over the  last five months, turns its investigators loose on other ailing thrifts.  </P> <P> Thrift Regulators Follow Up Investigations: The Office of Thrift Supervision,  which regulates savings and loans, and the RTC, which filed the federal  racketeering suit, continue to investigate additional allegations of fraud,  regulatory violations and other wrongdoing against the same defendants and new  targets.  </P> <P> Van de Kamp Initiates State Action: Van de Kamp, after naming Reiner and the  Sacramento County district attorney in December as special attorneys general to  probe possible criminal violations, decides to look at possible civil  wrongdoing, primarily in connection with the sale of debt securities at Lincoln  branches.  </P> <P> Bankruptcy Examiner Looks for Fraud: A court-appointed examiner in the  bankruptcy cases of American Continental and 11 Lincoln subsidiaries is looking  for fraud and mismanagement of the companies.  </P> <P> Creditors Hire Special Investigator: The unsecured creditors committee, formed  in American Continental's bankruptcy, brings in a special investigator and  audit team to uncover the causes of the bankruptcy. The committee is made up  mostly of debt holders.  </P> <P> Assembly Committee to Wind Up Probe: Three days of hearings and a massive  amount of documents are being boiled down into a report from a subcommittee of  the Assembly Finance and Insurance Committee. The investigation was sparked by  the committee's chairman, Pat Johnston, (D-Stockton).  </P> <P> RELATED INVESTIGATIONS  </P> <P> Senate Ethics Probe Targets Five: The five U.S. senators who intervened with  federal thrift regulators on behalf of Keating look to the Senate Select  Committee on Ethics to clear them of any ethical blame for their questioning of  regulatory treatment of Lincoln in April, 1987.  </P> <P> Accountants Face License Action: The state Board of Accountancy is looking into  the work of individual accountants at the firms of Arthur Young &amp; Co. (now  Ernst &amp; Young), Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. and Touche, Ross &amp; Co. (now  Deloitte &amp; Touche). Debt holders and others claim accountants  misrepresented American Continental's financial condition. The board can  recommend sanctions including revocation of licenses.  </P> <P> State Bar Reviews Conduct of 3 Lawyers: The State Bar of California starts an  investigation into the ethical conduct of Gov. Deukmejian's chief fund-raiser,  Karl M. Samuelian, and two others, Franklin Tom and Christine W. Bender.  Samuelian and Tom represented American Continental in winning Corporations  Department approval for the sale of debt securities. Bender, who came from the  same law firm, was the agency's commissioner when she approved the last debt  offering in May, 1988.  </P></p>

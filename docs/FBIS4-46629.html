			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Center for Administrative Management of </F> Strategic Nuclear Forces of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine  Chief Colonel Oleksandr Serdyuk by NARODNA ARMIYA commentator  Senior Lieutenant Serhiy Zhurets under the rubric: "First  Interview in the New Post": "The Warheads Will Be Removed From  Ukraine Over Three Years.--The Rest of the Problems of  Nuclear Disarmament Will Be Gotten Rid of as Quickly as  Possible"]    [Text] Background information on the  interviewee: The military path of Colonel Oleksandr  Serdyuk began from the Suvorov School, then on to the Kharkov  Command-Engineering School and officer service. He served first  in the Kartalinskyy Division, in an OS missile regiment, and  then went to the Academy imeni Dzerzhinskyy. After graduation he  was assigned to the Plesetsk test range.    Colonel Oleksandr Serdyuk returned to serve in Ukraine  in 1992. We was deputy chief of the directorate for missile and  space weaponry. and then was named by order of the Minister of  Defense to the position of chief of the Center for  Administrative Management of Strategic Nuclear Forces of the  Ministry of Defense [MO] of Ukraine.    [S. Zhurets] A Ukrainian delegation headed by Vice Prime  Minister Valeriy Shmarov recently returned from the United  States. There they discussed, among other things, the question  of deactivating the missile systems stationed in Ukraine. How do  you, directly heading up the structure of the MO that is  performing this crucial and difficult work, regard the status  and prospects for the nuclear disarmament of our nation?    [O. Serdyuk] The fulfillment of deactivation is naturally an  additional demand on the officers of the 43rd Army and the  officers of our Center, insofar as the task of removing the  missile systems from combat duty and performing the tasks of  deactivating them are being added to the everyday tasks of  maintaining the missile and special equipment in proper  condition. These tasks are work of enhanced security in and of  themselves, and their performance requires quite a bit of human  and material resources.    The principal burden of performing this work lies on the  officers of the 43rd Missile Army, with considerable  organizational activity performed by the specialists of our  center as well.    [S. Zhurets] And Ukraine will be able to fulfill  unconditionally the obligations it has assumed at the  international level, for the deactivation of the 46 SS-24  missiles, within the ten-month time period stipulated in the  trilateral statement of the presidents?    [O. Serdyuk] There are no grounds today to say that we will  not be able to perform those tasks. The removal of the combat  systems from duty is proceeding according to plan, and we are  fulfilling the schedule that was approved by the government, as  well as the schedule that was stipulated in addition to the  trilateral statement of the presidents. We have already  performed more than half of the deactivation work.    [S. Zhurets] The separation of the warheads from the  strategic missiles is perhaps the simplest of what awaits the  servicemen of the 43rd Army, with the more difficult  problems--in particular the subsequent destruction of the launch  stages and the missile silos, and the ecological support for  that process--still ahead. That work, as is well known,  envisages a comprehensive program of gradual cutbacks and the  elimination of land- and air-launched nuclear weapons. How is  the fulfillment of that program proceeding?    [O. Serdyuk] We are doing work in the preparatory stages of  fulfilling this comprehensive program that was approved by the  government. Ukraine, in accordance with the decree of the  Supreme Soviet ratifying the START-1 Treaty, is to eliminate 36  percent of the launch stages and launchers. Disarmament, as we  see, is thus a very prolonged process, which must be provided  with financial resources first and foremost. We have gotten into  a paradoxical situation today--it is much cheaper to maintain  the missile systems, to keep them in a proper state, than today,  under conditions of harsh economic crisis, when we have to  strain to remove those systems from duty. That process is not an  advantageous one for us economically. The amount of money that  we need for that has already been noted in the press. Without  sufficient financing we could get into a situation where we will  be forced, whether we want to or not, to lengthen the time  period or halt the work. I have in mind here not the  deactivation, but the work on the elimination itself. And it  would be a shame, of course, if the funds that are allocated for  the elimination measures (talking here about the trillion  karbovantsi allocated by the budget of Ukraine for 1994 for  elimination measures) were received very irregularly. As of  today, with a whole quarter virtually gone by, we have received  only approximately 27 billion karbovantsi of that required. That  is far too little. The more so as the comprehensive program is  not only, and not so much, the elimination measures alone. It is  also the resolution of the social problems of servicemen in the  strategic forces, which we have always put in first place. The  discussion here concerns the building of housing for officers,  the creation of jobs, medical support for the servicemen who  take part in the elimination measures and deactivation work.    The officers of the strategic forces are laboring under  highly strained conditions today. They have to perform three  tasks simultaneously--be on combat alert duty and maintain  combat readiness, remove the RS-18 missiles from service, and  carry out the deactivation process. These are one and the same  crews, one and the same people. And they, in performing their  crucial work to destroy one of the largest strategic arsenals in  the world, have to be certain of their future, of their social  protections.    That is why under today's conditions, with inadequate  financing, it would be expedient to adopt a model of the  elimination process whereby that elimination is carried out in  stages. After all of the work has been performed on one missile  system--that is, it has been removed from duty, broken down and  the equipment dismantled, social problems have been resolved and  work has been completed on recultivation of the terrain--only  then should the elimination of the next ballistic-missile system  begin. And not the way it could occur--all of the missiles taken  away, the silos closed up in accordance with the START-1  procedure, the holes left and the social problems of the  servicemen unresolved.    [S. Zhurets] What assistance can we expect from the United  States--so much talked about, especially lately--under these  conditions?    [O. Serdyuk] Comparative indicators of our expenditures on  the path of nuclear disarmament with the actual payments to this  process on the part of the United States is far from to the  advantage of the latter. As of May, we have received just 2,000  tonnes of fuel, three truck cranes and six specialized vehicles  out of the promised American aid, defined as 185 million dollars.    The principal shortcoming of the American aid is moreover  not  so much the amount of it, as the very narrow area for its  utilization. This was caused by the restrictions of Nunn-Lugar,  which does not permit that aid to be directed to the resolution  of such topical problems of the Armed Forces as social  protections for servicemen who will be discharged from the Army  owing to the elimination of the nuclear weapons. There will be,  after all, no "real" money, we will receive only the material  and technical means for the elimination work in the indicated  amount.    It must be pointed out that the assistance of the United  States should be considered not an act of charity, but rather as  natural compensation for the military and economic losses of  Ukraine connected with their nuclear weapons.    [S. Zhurets] One could perhaps recall here that one of the  recent consultations pertaining to the distribution of the  additional financial assistance of the Americans insisted that  50 million dollars be directed, first and foremost, to  dismantling the 46 SS-24 missiles.    [O. Serdyuk] Yes, that was the approach. The Americans have  a  vested interest in that elimination, and that is naturally why  they pose such questions. We have, in my view, so many problems  with regard to the elimination of those missiles whose guarantee  periods have expired, the RS-18s, that to say that we should  begin the elimination of the SS-24s would be absurd. Ukraine has  not assumed any international obligations whatsoever on that  score.    [S. Zhurets] We are to salvage more than a third of the  launch stages. A considerable portion of them were manufactured  in Russia. Wouldn't it be more advantageous to resolve the  problem with the salvaging of those missiles at Russian plants,  rather than invest funds in the expansion of a salvage base in  Dnipropetrovsk that will scarcely be needed after that work?    [O. Serdyuk] The decision has already been made pertaining  to  the the building of a yard and neutralization station at the  Pivdenne KB [Design Bureau]. That work has already started. That  is first; second, the Russian Federation has actually offered to  take those missiles for salvage. Those proposals, however, were  far from being free. Taking into account the fact that the  construction of the neutralization station is being done at the  expense of the American funds, that approach would obviously be  expedient.    [S. Zhurets] How do matters stand with fuel storage?    [O. Serdyuk] The construction of storage facilities for the  missile-fuel components is being done today at the expense of  that trillion for elimination, which is being allocated in very  erratic fashion. Quite a bit of effort will have to be applied  here to fulfill that task.    More than half of the heptyl could be used for the needs of  the national space program. The guaranteed storage time of  heptyl (close to fifteen years) would make it possible to count  on such an option.    [S. Zhurets] Since you have already brought up the  prospects,  one fundamental issue concerns the future of the infrastructure  of the 43rd Missile Army. It would be regrettable, after all, if  those multi-billion facilities were to be reduced to nothing.    [O. Serdyuk] The infrastructure of the missile systems  stationed on the territory of Ukraine could doubtless be  preserved and used again, with the corresponding government  decision and with the corresponding capital investment. It could  be preserved and used or wasted irreversibly, since after the  elimination of the missile launch silos in Ukraine, the aura  that is created by the status of a nuclear-missile state would  essentially be destroyed as well.    This decision is doubtless exceptionally important for the  future of Ukraine. A considered approach, in my opinion, has  been demonstrated by our parliament in designating a quota for  the elimination of launch stages and missile silos--36 percent.  The rest of the potential could and should be used for the  accomplishment of tasks connected with ensuring the country's  security. If all of this is destroyed, then we cannot expect  that Ukraine will be able to restore that infrastructure some  other time.    [S. Zhurets] Thank you for the interview, and I hope that  NARODNA ARMIYA, with your assistance, will return again to the  complex and exceptionally important topic for Ukraine of nuclear  disarmament.    As the material was being prepared for press, it became  known that an agreement has been signed between the governments  of Ukraine and the Russian Federation on the fulfillment of the  trilateral declaration of the presidents in Moscow. That  document stipulates deadlines for the removal of nuclear weapons  from the territory of Ukraine--no later than 1997--and the  obligation of Russia to send fuel for nuclear-power plants to  Ukraine and account for the value of the tactical weapons that  were removed from our territory, to be counted toward our debt  to Russia for power carriers.</p>

In the morning, the Bosnian Serbs' press  officer had stated in Pale that the UNHCR officials were no  longer authorized to leave the Serbian-held part of Bosnia.    UNHCR spokesman Ron Redmond stated: "We saw nothing  resembling a hostage-taking situation." He added that UNHCR  officials had been able to return to Belgrade from Zeppa, in  northeast Bosnia, on Thursday. UNHCR officials in Geneva  specified that UNHCR had not instructed its staff to leave the  Serbian area of Bosnia, as opposed to rumors.    On Thursday, three Banja Luka-based HCR officials wanting to  leave for Zagreb had been stopped by Serbian forces, who had  prevented them from passing because they had not received  notification of their departure 48 hours in advance. UNHCR  added that this kind of official harassment was not unusual.</p>

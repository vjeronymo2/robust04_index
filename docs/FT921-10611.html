			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Immigrants flock to Japan THE NUMBER of foreigners living illegally in Japan increased by 50 per cent to 159,828 last May compared with 10 months earlier, the Ministry of Justice said yesterday, No reasons were given for the rise but it is seen as a response to Japan's labour shortage. Many foreigners are working illegally in small manufacturing companies and in transport. The ministry computed the figures by comparing immigration entry and exit records. The largest number of illegal aliens was from the Philippines, at 27,226. The count from Korea rose by 86.3 per cent to 25,848, while illegal immigration from Iran surged from 764 to 10,915. Other countries contributing large numbers include Thailand, China, Malaysia and Bangladesh. Mr Sohei Miyashita, Japan's defence minister, said yesterday his ministry would cut Y100bn (Pounds 450.45m) from its current five-year budget to help compensate for Gulf war contributions, Reuter adds. Japan gave Dollars 9bn to the US-led coalition forces fighting to oust Iraq from Kuwait last year. Opposition parties had demanded a cut in the defence budget as part of a parliamentary deal on the Gulf war funds. The Defence Ministry said that it had earmarked Y22,750bn for defence in the current five-year programme to run from April 1991 to March 1996.</p>

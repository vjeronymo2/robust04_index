			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Sport: The ghost runners - Wishing that cricketers would write their own books / Bookshelf With England's cricketers embarked on their tour ofthe West Indies, I took the chance to read the life stories of two outstanding English batsmen, one, sadly, retired and the other keen to dominate the headlines by savaging Caribbean fast bowling. David Gower's autobiography is available in paperback (Gower, updated with a new chapter, Fontana 1993, Pounds 5.99), whileRobin Smith's (Quest for Number One, Boxtree 1993, Pounds 15.99) is a hard-back. Alas, both chose to produce their books with the help - or at least the collusion - of a 'ghost' writer, Gower with Martin Johnson and Smith with John Crace. The practice of ghost writing is not new. More than a century ago, WG Grace deemed himself enough of a national hero to write with the help of a friend, W. Methuen Brownlee, 'who has worked with me over every page and thus helped me to place this history of cricket before lovers of Our National Game' (Cricket, 1891). This left Grace more time to play the National Game. Until recently, most ghosts took their vocation more literally and remained invisible. In 1956, Brian Statham was helped by a ghost to write Cricket Merry-Go-Round (Stanley Paul), describing his early career with Lancashire and England. But there is no acknowledgement of the ghost in the book and Statham cannot now remember who it was. As the great fast bowler says: 'He just sat down on the sofawith me for a few days and jogged my memory. But I wouldn't allow any funny business because that's not me.' Indeed not. The ghost's function was purely mechanical; the story was Statham's. As a result, the book is free of the anger and self-control, revelation and regret, controversy and emotion with which modern ghosts sprinkle their efforts, to make them more spicy. We are in an age ofcricket literature where journalist ghosts aim to give their books style as well as shape. Gower's publishers assure us that his is 'frank and outspoken' (just in case we had been foolish enough to hope it might be calm and informative). The added chapter is called 'You Must Be ****ing Joking'. All the chapters have joky titles, such as 'Laid back - and think of England' and 'A millionaire? That's rich'. Some serious reading is required to work out that the book seeks to tell its story chronologically, especially as it is constantly whizzing backwards and forwards, picking up references it never made properly. It ishard to remember how far the story has got. Gower makes a few interesting points about Peter Willey's career with Leicestershire, but they do not get any easier to follow with Willey being called Peter Willey, Peter, Willey and Willin the space of just over one page. He gets this quick, muddled treatment in the middle of a chapter about England's tour of Australia in winter 1986-87 and Pakistan's tour of England in summer 1987. While it is not always clear to which player, tour, year or nickname 'Gower' is refering, Smith's autobiography is easier to read. It was written before last summer's humiliatingseries against the Australians so, before that, only his ineptitude against Mushtaq Ahmed's leg-spin had brought him untoward publicity on a large scale. He describes the methods, particularly practice, with which he intends to improve histechnique against spin bowling. Unlike Gower's book, Smith's is organised clearly, although subjects that are connected crucially but indirectly with the game - such as the place of the press in international cricket - are touched on without being followed through to conclusions. Like many modern cricket books, this is one of comment without complete argument or observation. It is arranged by topic, not time. Perhaps this is partly because time seems less important in Smith's cricketing life than it was in Gower's, where it brought constant change and vicissitude. One chapter describes Smith's entry into first-class cricket, and a closing chapter his tour of India and Sri Lanka in 1992-93. But all the other chapters deal with issues - for example, Confidence, Luck, Motivation - and take their material from the whole of Smith's career. There is something to be said for this system, although it giveslittle sense of Smith's cricketing development. Nor am I at my best with intensive sport psychology of the sort favoured by Crace: 'Almost by definition, any player who feels that he doesn't need a shrink after being ravaged by the tabloid press needs a shrink.' It was a relief to read some plain facts about Smith's preparation for top-class cricket. When the boys' father saw how talented his two sons were, he took the splendidly imperial step of setting up nets and hiring a professional as coach to the Smith home in Natal, South Africa. Robin was 10 when he began serious cricket training, sometimes getting up at4.30am to begin work. The public has become too tolerant ofautobiographies written scrappily and badly by increasingly obtrusive ghosts. More than 60 years ago, FS Ashley-Cooper (Cricket Highways and Byways, George Allen and Unwin, 1927) a writer and essayist of English cricket's heroic age, warned: 'Whole newspaper columns, and even entire books, have borne the names of players who did not themselves write or even inspire a single word.' We are still ignoring this warning - to our cost.</p>

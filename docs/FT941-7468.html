			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / International Company News: Foreign groups cleared to invest in Hungarian power The Hungarian authorities yesterday cleared the way for foreign groups to acquire up to 100 per cent of the country's regional power distribution and conventional power stations in eastern Europe's first electricity privatisation. The five regional electricity companies (RECs) are capitalised at Ft240bn (Dollars 2.4bn) and non-nuclear power generators have a nominal worth of a further Ft154bn, making this potentially the biggest privatisation so far in the region. Interest in the RECs is expected primarily from Electricite de France, Germany's Bayernwerk and other west European utilities which made offers in an unsuccessful tender last year when just 15 per cent stakes in the Hungarian distributors were offered. AV RT, the state holding company, advised by London-based J. Henry Schroder Wagg, said it had decided to structure the industry on the UK model, separating distribution, transmission and generation. Mr Lajos Csepi, AV RT chief executive, said it hoped to issue the first tenders for sale in April or May with a view to completion in the autumn. The holding company said it planned to maintain 50 per cent ownership of the industry, based on nominal capital structure. The government would control some nuclear power stations. Although foreign investors would have the right to take full control, it cautioned that it was more likely that they would take 'significant' stakes with the promise of management control. A 'significant stake' is understood to be at least 30 per cent. Other tranches would be reserved for employees, partial stock market flotations and a preferential, government scheme for smaller investors. The Dollars 875m privatisation of Matav, the Hungarian telecoms company, followed this pattern.</p>

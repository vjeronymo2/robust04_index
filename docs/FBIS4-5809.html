			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 14 KYODO -- Japan's two top financial  officials indicated in speeches Thursday that the domestic  economy is poised to snap out of its three-year-old recession.    Addressing an annual convention of trust bankers, Finance  Minister Hirohisa Fujii and Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno  said a recovery is in sight on the heels of the latest stimulus  measures.    "The economy is showing signs of hitting bottom," Mieno  said,  indicating a firmer view than his latest press comments by  dropping off the phrase "on the whole."    In a press conference last week, the central bank chief  described the economy as "showing signs of hitting bottom on the  whole" and said his assessment is "changing delicately."    Fujii said, "the time is steadily ripening for the economy  to  recover...although tough conditions are still continuing." The  finance minister earlier said the economy is in "a delicate  stage" and statistics to date "have not yet proved the economy  has hit bottom."    Both Fujii and Mieno cited improvements, led by personal  consumption, since early this year.    Mieno, stressing that conditions had improved since last  year, also said, "various positive factors for an economic  recovery have increased over the past year."    Japan's economy last year suffered unexpected downward drags  such as the yen's sharp appreciation and unusually cool and wet  summer, causing it to fall off after showing signs of recovery.    Mieno particularly cited progressing inventory adjustments  and corporate restructuring, support from fiscal and monetary  measures, and recent recovery in economies abroad.    Fujii said he is confident that the economy-oriented budget  for fiscal 1994 and the record 15.25 trillion yen stimulus  package launched in February will "greatly contribute" to  putting the economy on a full recovery track soon in the current  fiscal year.    Meanwhile, Mieno noted some prevailing concerns, such as  spreading labor cutbacks, a possible further rise of the yen,  and ongoing write-offs of losses incurred by financial  institutions and companies after the collapse of the economic  bubble of the late 1980s.    Keeping in mind these possible downward pressures, Mieno  said, "a further cautious watch is necessary" to see if the  improvement in some areas is sustainable and can spread to  overall business activities. He said he will carefully monitor  monetary and economic developments.    Considering liquidation of bad loans, both Fujii and Mieno  gave high marks to voluntary efforts by financial institutions,  and called for further moves in line with market and other  deregulatory steps taken recently by the financial authorities.</p>

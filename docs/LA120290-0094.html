			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN RIGHT;  </P> <P> BUSH TAKES THE TOUGH PATH AND SUCCEEDS;  </P> <P> BUT HOW MUCH EFFORT THE SECURITY COUNCIL WILL PUT INTO A MILITARY EFFORT IS  UNCERTAIN.  </P> <P> George Bush is not only trying to turn back Saddam Hussein's aggression. Like  Woodrow Wilson and Harry Truman, Bush is deeply, self-consciously engaged in  trying to create a system of global security.  </P> <P> "The civilized world is now in the process of fashioning the rules that will  govern the new world order beginning to emerge in the aftermath of the Cold  War," he wrote in Newsweek magazine.  </P> <P> Bush's dream is global. When he says "we" he means "the civilized world." When  he says "our" he means "the world community." When he says "we must turn back  Saddam Hussein," he means all "would-be Saddam Husseins."  </P> <P> His goal is nothing less than a world community based on law. "When we succeed  . . . we will have demonstrated that aggression will not be tolerated. We will  have invigorated a United Nations that contributes as its founders dreamed. We  will have established principles for acceptable international conduct and the  means to enforce them."  </P> <P> These broader objectives explain why Bush did not choose a "Libyan solution" to  turn back Hussein, why he has so often turned to the United Nations and so  emphasized U.N. support for U.S. actions.  </P> <P> They explain why Bush decided to seek an explicit, specific authorization for  the use of force from the U.N. Security Council, even though the United States  and its allies could easily and perhaps more expeditiously have acted under  Article 51 of the U.N. Charter. That article provides: "Nothing in the present  charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective  self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a member of the United Nations,  until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain  international peace and security."  </P> <P> Bush has also sought to strengthen the United Nations.  </P> <P> The irony is that, in the process of dealing with Saddam Hussein and  establishing new principles of international conduct, Bush is also  demonstrating the many obstacles to an effective global system of collective  security.  </P> <P> Even in this "singular moment" in history, with the Cold War divisions that  paralyzed the United Nations overcome and the blocs partially neutralized, it  remains difficult to deal with a clear-cut case of aggression. The process of  consultation and consensus has proved cumbersome, time-consuming and, in a  fundamental sense, irrational.  </P> <P> The 15-member Security Council is hardly an ideal arena through which to seek  peace in a conflict between two gulf states. The composition of that body is a  major obstacle. Grant the dubious proposition that the five permanent members  -- the United States, Britain, France, China and the Soviet Union -- and Canada  are involved in all problems by virtue of their broad involvement in the world.  Grant that Yemen has a large stake as a neighbor in the region.  </P> <P> That leaves Colombia, Ethiopia, Finland, Malaysia, the Ivory Coast, Cuba,  Romania and Zaire. Collectively, they have the power to decide the outcome even  though they have no special knowledge of the countries or the regions and no  special stake in that outcome. Since they will risk neither lives nor money in  this conflict, they are good examples of representation without taxation.  </P> <P> Article 51 is a more reasonable basis for acting than a procedure in which  those prepared to resist an aggressor must seek permission from those who are  not.  </P> <P> And, of course, no one knows how stable the Security Council consensus  supporting military action will prove, nor how much effort the council will  make to manage the conflict once it is under way -- although it is clear that  the council lacks the unity, will and dispatch needed for decisive action. We  know only that the process of producing global consensus is complex, laborious,  expensive and reasonably effective.  </P> <P> Mobilizing this diverse body has already required weeks of shuttling around the  globe by Bush and Baker, untold hours of negotiation and God knows how many  quiet commitments to Security Council members.  </P> <P> Meanwhile in Washington, the clamor among Democrats reminds the Administration  that world consensus is not enough. George Bush needs Congress as well.  </P> <P> And before those consultations are done, Bush may feel closer to Yemen and  Zaire than to Sam Nunn and Christopher Dodd.  </P></p>

			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Finance and the Family: Lender offers to explain - A credit confession by Barclaycard BARCLAYCARD, which turns down almost half of new applicants for its credit card, is to explain to applicants its reasons for rejecting them. Until now, issuers of credit cards have fought shy of disclosing too much information, claiming that this would make them vulnerable to fraudsters. Last year, however, Sir Gordon Borrie, Director General of the Office of Fair Trading, said lenders should be more open about their use of credit scoring - a technique used to decide whether to grant credit. The system works by allocating points to various characteristics which the lender believes will help predict whether an applicant will repay credit. These include age, occupation and residential status. The total score is then used by the lender to decide whether to issue a card. Barclaycard, which ran a pilot study on 3,000 people late last year, says it has decided to tell applicants why they failed the credit scoring process because it believes many creditworthy customers slip through the net. It hopes to accept thousands of new customers a year as a result. 'Being refused a new credit card must come to many customers as a shock,' said Bob Potts, managing director of Barclaycard. 'This new scheme is designed to explain why a card has been refused and will particularly help consumers whose ability to repay credit cannot easily be established from a standard credit card application form.' Although there may be many areas in which a low overall score is made, Chris Tucker, of Barclaycard, says that one section may let down an applicant more than others. Pilot tests showed that the most common reason was an inability by Barclaycard to verify bank or building society details. This was not necessarily because of bad relations between an individual and their bank but because it was not the bank's policy to provide details. Sometimes an applicant is refused because they have not made clear what their job is. A house move could also contribute to a low score because the applicant may not yet be on the electoral roll which Barclaycard would use to verify details of where they live. 'We've been asking card issuers for a long while to do this and we applaud Barclaycard for providing this improved service,' said Graeme Jacobs, of the Consumers' Association. 'We have always understood the need not to give away too many details but at the same time, applicants should be given an indication of the reason for their refusal.' The credit scoring process is just one test which issuers run on an individual. Others include referral to a credit reference agency. Applicants turned down for a credit card because of the information supplied by a credit reference agency have a right to know its name and should contact the issuer within 28 days of refusal. The issuer will have to supply the name and address within seven working days. Credit reference agencies have to make available to individuals the file they hold on them so long as individuals requesting information enclose Pounds 1 and their name and address.</p>

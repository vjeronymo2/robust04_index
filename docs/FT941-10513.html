			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: High cost of local reform Sir, Your extensive coverage of the problems associated with local government reform in England unfortunately did not include a reference to the publication on Thursday last week of a study by accountants of the cost of reform in Scotland. It is entitled Local Government Reorganisation in Scotland: A Critical Evaluation of Costs. The study estimates the cost of change is between two and three times the figure quoted by the secretary of state for Scotland, with none of the resultant operational savings claimed by the govern-ment. As has been pointed out in your columns, it is extraordinary that the government is intent on pursuing in the UK measures with such high transitional costs (amounting to Pounds 400m for Scotland alone), when the national priority is to ensure the country's emergence from recession. To the cash costs of the change have to be added the opportunity costs of the disruption of services to industry and the community, with no confidence that benefits - financial or other - will follow. Eric Milligan, convenor, Lothian Regional Council, Regional Chambers, Parliament Square, Edinburgh EH1 1TT</p>

			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Pledge to poorest nations The US has pledged Dollars 100m (Pounds 67m) in its 1995 budget for the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility, the International Monetary Fund's subsidised loan account to help the poorest nations reform their economies. If the pledge survives the budget's passage through Congress, it would leave Germany as the only main industrialised country not to have contributed to the new ESAF, which the IMF hopes to launch this spring in place of the almost exhausted fund it launched in 1987. The US contribution will be paid to the subsidy account which allows the IMF to cut the interest rate it charges on ESAF loans to the minimal level of 0.5 per cent. The money will be paid up front, so it will be valued as a contribution of more than SDR100m (Pounds 108m), roughly the level that other countries had been asking for as a fair US share. The overall US budget for international affairs will remain stagnant at Dollars 20.9bn, with aid to the states of the former Soviet Union roughly halved to Dollars 900m. The administration's proposals to cut humanitarian assistance spending by Dollars 77m to Dollars 1.63bn, including a Dollars 37m cut in refugee aid, could run into criticism in Congress. The aid budget proposes full payment of this year's Dollars 1.25bn slice of the US pledge to the International Development Association, the World Bank subsidised loan facility similar to the IMF's ESAF. It also provides Dollars 87m to start clearing US arrears in payments to the multilateral development banks, including Dollars 20m of arrears to the African Development Fund. The administration also proposes to restore the Dollars 70m US contribution to the capital of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which was struck out of last year's budget amid the furore over the bank's lavish London headquarters.</p>

			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Schroder Ventures apologises to CINVen SCHRODER Ventures yesterday made a highly unusual public apology to a competitor, CINVen, the venture capital arm of the Coal Board's in-house fund manager. The venture capital arm of Schroders Plc in a press statement admitted that one of its executives had circulated a document saying that CINVen managers 'received exceptional and unfair returns'. Schroder Ventures said yesterday it 'unreservedly repudiates this document which contains major errors of fact'. It said the document was the source of press articles criticising the way CINVen managers are paid. CINVen also manages the venture capital portion of the British Rail and Barclays Bank pension funds. The move comes amid rising competition between fund managers following the sharp shrinkage of new investment in venture capital. An agreement between Schroders and CINVen meant neither party would make any comment beyond a limited press statement. However, CINVen had made it clear it would take legal action if a public apology were not forthcoming. An article in the Financial Times on August 27, which CINVen said was 'fair and accurate', pointed out that CINVen fund managers are able to profit from a co-investment scheme which allows them to purchase a portion of the 'sweet equity' used to finance management buy-outs without having to invest in the less risky but lower-yielding loan stock. However, the Schroder document contained further allegations, not printed by the Financial Times, which were yesterday withdrawn. Sweet equity is the highest-risk but potentially most profitable security issued in connection with venture capital. The practice of allowing managers to co-invest in sweet equity is not uncommon in the fund management industry but many investors' advisers frown on the practice. However, CINVen's structure does not allow it to offer the most common alternative, known as carried interest, in which managers earn roughly 20 per cent of all the venture pool's profits. This can be more lucrative than co-investment schemes limited to sweet equity. Remuneration structures in the venture capital industry have recently been under pressure from investors who argue that some fund managers rewards are not tied closely enough to performance or the skills to do the job. Several of the latest venture capital pooled funds have had to promise higher returns to investors before fund managers could share in the profits.</p>

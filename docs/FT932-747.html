			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: How to insure the family yacht - Luckily for amateur sailors, pleasure boat insurance is highly competitive and from - boats have soared over the last few years. Dennis Mossman, yacht manager of Navigators and General, a subsidiary of the Eagle Star insurance company, says that small speedboats are most at risk. 'Bigger boats that are taken are mostly found, but small speedboats you never find again. The theft rate for those is enormous,' he says. Equipment left on board moored boats, even masts and winches, is another target for thieves. General Accident agrees about the scale of the problem. At least a third of its boat claims are now crime related, and the majority of claims over Pounds 10,000 are for theft. However, Mossman says the rise seems to have peaked. Luckily for all amateur sailors, pleasure boat insurance is a highly competitive area, possibly because the recession has meant fewer new yachts being sold and needing insurance, and existing ones are kept out of use. So in spite of rising crime rates, premiums for most classes of boat have not risen in line. Premiums are calculated using a combination of factors on an individual basis, with no standard table of rates. 'It's not like cars - there are thousands of different types of boats,' says Mossman. 'You can't just say, 'it's a Ford Escort'.' On average, premiums work out at about 1 per cent of a boat's value - likely to be more for speedboats and less for sailing boats not used for racing. Larger boats, even if worth less, can cost more to repair because of the difficulty in getting them out of the water, so size can affect the amount you have to pay. Where the boat is kept also makes a difference. If it is small and normally kept out of the water, there may be stringent security conditions requiring it to be kept under lock and with its trailer wheel-clamped. A boat in a marina may be cheaper to insure than one at an isolated river mooring, and inner city moorings may incur higher premiums. 'Where there are more boats there is usually better security,' says Dennis Mossman, but of course marina berths can be pricy. Policies may also specify that if a boat is to be kept out during the winter, the mooring must be approved by the insurer. The area where you intend to use your boat will also affect the premium. Cover is often restricted to inland waterways and UK coastal waters, but can usually be extended to Europe, the Mediterranean, the US east coast, or the Caribbean. Round-the-world yachtsmen may have difficulty getting insurance as standard policies from British insurers rarely stretch beyond the Atlantic, and an individual deal may be prohibitively costly. Racing can be another pricy area, though small-scale family and club racing are not generally seen as too risky. Chris Day, managing director of Jardine Maritime, one of the specialist brokers for private yacht insurance, warns that for racing risks you will have to pay the first third of any claim, which can be expensive. Christopher Knox-Johnston (brother of the famous yachtsman), of Haven Knox-Johnston, yacht insurers at Lloyd's, says that one of the biggest problems is people's ignorance of what to do in the event of an accident claim. The procedure differs from a motor insurance claim. There are no 'knock-for-knock' agreements among marine insurers. Boat owners are responsible for making the boat safe, getting estimates, paying repair bills and claiming them back from the insurer. They should also write to the other party involved in an accident to hold them liable. Knox-Johnston's advice is to contact the insurer as soon as possible after an accident or theft to check how to proceed. The cover provided under most policies is based on the institute yacht clauses used at Lloyd's, which include named 'marine perils' such as breaking adrift, groundings and collisions, as well as fire and theft. Since the clauses were rewritten in 1985, however, many insurers have developed their own wording, so cover may vary. Haven Knox-Johnston now offers an all-risks policy. It is important to look at the level of cover as well as the price when choosing a policy. Wear and tear, design problems, mechanical failure and war damage are excluded by many policies. Theft of equipment and possessions may be covered only if there is forcible entry - if you leave a boat unattended and unlocked, even for a few minutes, you may unable to claim for anything stolen. The small print may specify security precautions needed, especially for high-risk items such as boats on trailers and outboard motors. Other security measures, such as photographing the boat, recording serial numbers and marking all equipment, dinghies and so on with the boat's name and owner's postcode, are strongly recommended. As the market for boat insurance is relatively small, there is a very limited number of providers, and perhaps a dozen specialist brokers. One of the big names is Navigators and General, which sells its policies mostly through brokers, and specialises in medium sized boats, over 16ft 6in, valued at up to Pounds 1.5m. The average value is Pounds 25,000. Haven Knox-Johnston has a range of three plain English, all-risks boat policies, which are sold through ordinary insurance brokers who would otherwise not offer yacht cover. No-claims discounts of up to 20 per cent are also available. Specialist brokers can also offer policies from European insurers, which usually provide similar cover, but not always - you should check the small print. Some may exclude third party liability, for example. Members of the Royal Yachting Association are entitled to a 10 per cent discount on insurance bought through brokers Bishop Skinner, and holders of certain RYA qualifications can get further discounts. General Accident is one of the general insurers which can provide yacht cover. It has two basic policies, one for small craft up to 16ft 6in, and one for larger yachts and motor boats. It offers no-claim bonuses of up to 25 per cent after five years.</p>

			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Estate agents' image improved, Borrie says THE RECESSION and tighter regulations governing estate agents are combining to improve the image of the profession, Sir Gordon Borrie, director-general of fair trading, said yesterday. Complaints were still being made, he said, but the image of estate agents had improved, he told the annual conference of the National Association of Estate Agents in London. 'A short time ago, the image of estate agents could hardly have been worse,' Sir Gordon said. 'Any stand-up comedian searching for an easy laugh could . . . (conjure) up a picture of a wide boy with a cellular phone making a fortune out of other peoples' homes with very little effort.' But the recession meant 'a number of people' had left the estate agency business. 'When you add to that the greater requirements of the new regulations, the image of the estate agent has improved. I see no reason why it should not improve.' The Office of Fair Trading had banned about 155 estate agents from the property business in the past 10 years, and recently the rate of expulsions had increased. There was also a rise in complaints about estate agents. 'There is a greater awareness among the public that there are complaints procedures and things can be done,' Sir Gordon said. Mr David Ware, association chairman, said there should be a compulsory registration scheme for estate agents to stop people with no qualifications opening property offices. It would be impractical to require every agent to have a licence but at least one person should hold such a qualification in every estate agency office, he said, adding that an upturn in the market was likely to mean 'cowboy' agents making a comeback. Against that, Sir Gordon said a licensing system might lead to less choice for consumers and increase the cost of selling a home.</p>

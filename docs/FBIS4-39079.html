			<p>BFN     [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 2/6/1994 -- The Union of Public  Organizations Parties and Movements organized a rally yesterday  in Tiraspol. Professor V. Yakovlev, former deputy of the  Moldovan Parliament known for his orthodox communist views, is  the leader of the union. V. Yakovlev and representatives of  other political organizations opposed the promotion of market  economic reforms in Dniester and the introduction of private  ownership of land and privatization in general. Appeals to  restore the Soviet Union could be heard during the rally.  Yakovlev declared that recently an initiative group had been  created to bring about the creation of a union of unrecognized  states. It is assumed that alongside Dniester, Abkhazia,  Karabakh and another breakaway regions will be members of this  union. The rally attracted about 1,000 people, most of whom  were elderly. People carried red flags and sang the USSR's  anthem. Local observers note that the rally was not obstructed  by militia although the emergency state prolonged by Igor  Smirnov [Dniester president] forbids such manifestations.</p>

			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / International Company News: France tests interest in media superhighway Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, the French budget and communications minister, yesterday called on private-sector companies to take part in trial services to prepare the way for a planned information superhighway. 'I don't want just France Telecom to respond,' he told a conference in Paris, in a reference to the state-owned operator. 'One system for experiment could be exclusively private, one public and one mixed,' he said, referring to trial services to be launched at a local level next year, after a selection process in the spring. The services are aimed at testing technologies, equipment and regulations for the government's plans to develop a national information superhighway by 2015. The network, aimed at enabling the transmission of data, voice and images, has drawn interest from French telecoms and communications groups such as Alcatel, Generale des Eaux and Lyonnaise des Eaux. The last two are principally involved in water distribution and public works, but have diversified into media and telecoms. Media and retail companies have also expressed interest in providing multimedia services. Both Mr Sarkozy and Mr Jose Rossi, the industry and telecoms minister, outlined a pragmatic approach to the development of an information superhighway. 'We must avoid the temptation of a dirigiste approach,' Mr Rossi said, citing previous policy errors. In particular, the Plan Cable, launched in the early 1980s and designed to provide a national cable-television network, has failed. Cable operators have suffered big losses, and the country has one of the lowest subscriber rates in Europe. Mr Sarkozy said he hoped to use the national cable-television network for information services. 'It would be bad if the FFr40bn (Dollars 7.4bn) invested in these networks turned out to be wasted,' he said. However, a report commissioned by the government from Mr Gerard Thery, the former managing director of France Telecom, has called for a substantial investment in new infrastructure to achieve the government's objective. According to the report, an investment of up to FFr200bn is needed by 2015. Much of this would be used to extend a fibre optic network. Yesterday's conference drew interest from French and international business groups. Mr Jacques-Henri David, managing director of Generale des Eaux, said his company hoped to participate in the trials, offering telecoms and media services through its existing cable networks, as it does in the UK via its General Cable division. He said the company also planned to work with partners from the computer and telecoms equipment industries to develop other services. Mr Marcel Roulet, chairman of France Telecom said the state-owned operator would participate in the trials by providing networks, services and the systems which co-ordinate services and their distribution.</p>

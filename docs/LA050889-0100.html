			<p><P> May 8, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOUTHLAND;  </P> <P> MILD QUAKE FELT -- BUT BARELY  </P> <P> A mild earthquake rumbled through the eastern end of the Los Angeles Basin at  5:45 this morning, but there were no reports of damage or injury.  </P> <P> Seismologists at Caltech said the temblor, which was centered under the  Hacienda Heights area, measured 2.9 on the Richter scale. They said this  morning's shock was unrelated to the twin quakes in October, 1987, that  devastated nearby Whittier or to two moderate temblors last weekend that jolted  the Brea and Oceanside areas.  </P></p>

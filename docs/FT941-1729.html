			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Swan Hunter rescue still in balance The prospects of Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder in receivership, finding a buyer were still in the balance last night after a day of intensive negotiations between French-owned Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie and Swan Hunter receivers Price Waterhouse. CMN had hoped to bid for Swan Hunter before today's Ministry of Defence deadline for submission of tenders for the refit of the landing ship Sir Bedivere. However no bid was made yesterday. Joint receiver Mr Gordon Horsfield said last night that he was hopeful of seeing a sale within the next few days, although any agreement with CMN was likely to be conditional on winning the refit. Price Waterhouse said it would today submit to the MoD its tender for the refit. It described the contract as critical to the yard's survival. For the tender to have any chance of success, it must be underwritten by a prospective buyer for Swan Hunter. To maintain the bid's credibility the underwriting needs to take place within a matter of days. Price Waterhouse did not rule out the possibility of another bidder coming forward. Mr Fred Henderson, leader of the CMN bid team, said: 'Our interest is in buying Swan Hunter as a viable, continuing business, although some negotiation has still to be done.' He confirmed that any offer would be conditional on winning the Sir Bedivere tender. The importance of a bid from CMN - the only company to say publicly that it wants to buy the yard - was heightened yesterday by news from Southampton-based shipbuilder Vosper Thornycroft that it felt there were 'insufficient grounds' for it to make an offer at this stage. It said it would keep the position under review. Earlier this week CMN insisted that it must have categorical government assurances that if it bought Swan Hunter it would be treated equally with other, UK-owned, shipyards in the fight for future MoD contracts. The MoD said it had given general assurances and added that a specific letter to CMN might be sent 'in the very near future'.</p>

"This is like  something you hear about happening in the 1950s or '60s."  </P> <P> Middle Tennessee Coach Bruce Stewart pieced together the makeshift team this  week after eight players were suspended by the Ohio Valley Conference for  fighting during a game against Tennessee Tech a week ago.  </P> <P> Two other Blue Raider basketball players are injured.  </P></p>

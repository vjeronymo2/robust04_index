			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Survey of Global Custody (1): Competition livens up - Once a dreary backwater of telex machines, clerks and computer tapes, global custody has become the focus of international rivalry. The effect has forced banks to think of new products to lure clients A CROSS-BORDER securities settlement and administration product, global custody has for years been little more than a back office operation, far from the glamour of banking. In recent years, however, the business, once a dreary backwater of telex machines, clerks and computer tape, has been the beneficiary of large amounts of capital investment, as new bank competitors have entered the market. The US-based commercial banks which have dominated this business are increasingly being challenged by the rise of strong international competitors, particularly in Japan and Continental Europe, and by investment banks which have only recently fully understood how to capitalise on their traditional role as master custodian for clients. The effect has been a scaling-down of fees to levels previously undreamt of, forcing banks to think of new products which will make their service stand out from that of their competitors. Earlier this year, the industry drew a collective gasp that State Street Boston, one of the top 10 custodians, planned to charge the US's largest institutional investor, the California Public Employees Retirement System, less than one basis point for global custody services. A typical portfolio for a global custody client might carry fees around six basis points - down sharply from the 20 basis point fee which would have prevailed just five years earlier, according to Mr Michael Borkan, head of client relations at Bank of New York. Fee pressures on European managers - who do not make custody charges public  -are more modest than in the US, but custodians say that European clients will seek lower fees eventually as well. In addition, the admission of fund managers - the clients of global custodians - to the international bank payments system known as Swift, raises some ominous questions for the future of some custodians. Clients will now be able to transmit instructions directly to, say, a sub-custodian bank in Thailand, bypassing the global custodian entirely. 'Fund managers may well communicate directly with each other and with subcustodians directly,' says Mr Robert Meyrick, head of Barclays Global Securities Services. 'Fund managers may eventually grow out of their need for global custodians,' he says. Only by providing services such as cash management to an increasingly sophisticated clientele can custodians continue to retain their customers. There are two main reasons why banks are eager to be in a business where fees are falling and competitors rising. First, custodians have learned how to exploit certain ancillary aspects of transactions banking so efficiently that only a relatively small proportion of global custody revenues need come from client fees. According to Mr Richard Foster, partner at the financial services practice of management consultants, Booz Allen, a study of the business has shown that no more than 50 to 60 per cent of custodians' revenues come from client fees. An additional 20 to 30 per cent of revenues comes from the ability to earn interest on clients' cash balances, and the rest from foreign exchange transactions on behalf of customers. Most clients are too sophisticated to allow their banker to exploit these inefficiencies at their expense, but they can still be sold bolt-on services such as cash management and foreign exchange dealing. Moreover, with falling loan margins and rising write-offs from bad debts, banks are anxious to seek out fee-based services which are more likely to withstand the pressures of the present recession. Ms Diane Glossman, banking analyst at Salomon Brothers, notes in a recent study of transactions banking in the US, that over the past decade, non-interest income at large US banks rose to 40.6 per cent of total revenues in 1991, from 26.0 per cent in 1981. And while the largest portion of that has been from fees on client accounts, for some banks transactions fees have been quite significant. 'Given that we expect loan demand to remain lacklustre in the face of an unusually slow economic recovery in the US, we believe that banks will continue to seek fee income as a replacement for volume,' Ms Glossman said. Banks are willing to continue to invest large capital sums in their global custody businesses, Ms Glossman notes, because large economies of scale are available to the biggest participants, enabling them to charge competitive fees to clients. Indeed, Booz Allen estimates that the doubling of assets under a custodian's control translates into a 35 per cent reduction in costs. There appears also to be a return to more broadly-based banking relationships as the largest companies reduce the number of banks with which they conduct business. 'Clients and banks are looking for linkage between products and relationship pricing,' Ms Glossman says. Thus banks with a wide product range can capture clients more fully. Some bankers acknowledge privately, too, that greater credit provision can be extended to a custody client because the investment portfolio offers the lender a greater comfort about liquidity and solvency. Too many firms have, nevertheless, entered the global custody business, for it to be profitable for all. 'We are looking for more consolidation,' said Antonio Wever of Booz Allen. Already, Mellon Bank's recent acquisition of blue-chip Boston Safe Company is regarded as a signpost to the future. The successful businesses which remain will be those which have most closely integrated global custody functions with other banking services. This means not only the ability to integrate the traditional master custody business with other services, such as cash or foreign exchange management, but also to present information to clients in an integrated fashion. Bank of New York, for instance, says it is developing a product which will allow clients to see not only their securities positions on a daily basis but all the supporting positions in derivatives or short sales elsewhere. Such a product is of great interest to clients with investment portfolios which commonly include all sorts of exchange traded and bespoke futures and options, as well as complex hedging strategies. Some of the US commercial banks who were the traditional industry leaders might find themselves somewhat disadvantaged, Booz Allen has concluded, because their global custody business was developed as a service distinct from that of domestic custody. 'The merchant banks - such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley - may be the next industry leaders,' says Mr Foster. Investment banks have been best able to exploit the opportunities for international securities lending which are offered to global custodians. This business alone can provide profits to justify entry to the business, Booz Allen has concluded. Furthermore, many of these traditional operators have been saddled with enormous duplication of services within their business which drives costs up considerably. It will be the ability to slim services down and eliminate many of the manual operations now required of custodians which will determine who will be profitable and who will fall by the wayside.</p>

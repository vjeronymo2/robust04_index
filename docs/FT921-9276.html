			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / India starts easing import restrictions INDIA yesterday started the process of easing the restrictions on imports imposed in March last year when the country was in the midst of a severe balance of payments crisis. Mr S. Venkitaramanan, the governor of the Reserve Bank of India, the country's central bank, announced in Bombay that the requirement of a 25 per cent cash margin on letters of credit for imports would be withdrawn from today. Simultaneously, the surcharge that banks were required to impose on import credit will also be withdrawn. As a result, industry will be able to import without difficultly the raw materials and components it needs urgently to raise production. The move follows the rise in the foreign exchange reserves to a healthy level of over Rs 100bn (Pounds 2.13bn) following various measures taken by the government. These include the first instalments of a standby credit of Dollars 2.2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) from the IMF and immunity schemes for Indians with foreign bank accounts if they repatriate their illegal wealth. Easing restrictions is part of the economic reforms initiated since July last year by the Narasimha Rao government. This has led to withdrawal of a number of government controls and regulations, including those on foreign investment and industrial licensing. However, import restrictions were retained, except for minor changes, until the foreign exchange reserves improved. Trade and industry has long been pleading for the easing of the restrictions on the grounds that they were affecting industrial production. Industrialists blame the restrictions on imports and bank credit for the recession and they have, therefore, been asking for their withdrawal. Dr Manmohan Singh, minister of finance, said restrictions would be eased as soon as foreign exchange reserves reached a healthy level.</p>

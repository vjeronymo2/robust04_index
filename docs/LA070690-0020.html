			<p><P> July 6, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRST IMPRESSIONS: VERSAILLES SEQUEL A MATCH FOR ORIGINAL  </P> <P> There's a certain nervousness among the regulars of Versailles, the Cuban  restaurant on Venice Boulevard, that is practically a commissary for the  production VPs and film crews that work at the studios nearby. The reason for  their distress: Versailles II.  </P> <P> Can the sequel be as good as the original?  </P> <P> It's too soon to tell, but judging by the first week's business, it will  probably be as popular. Expect to wait in line for a dinner table -- especially  after 7:30.  </P> <P> The new Versailles, 1415 S. La Cienega Blvd., Los Angeles, (213) 289-0392,  covers a lot of the same themes as the old Versailles. There's the same  non-decor (red Naugahyde chairs, etc.), a lot of the same wisecracking waiters  and, basically, the same menu -- including the list of daily specials scrawled  on a mirrored board. The dining room is smaller, though, and there seems to be  more emphasis on takeout here.  </P> <P> And what about the chicken? (Chicken -- roasted, full of garlic and buried  under a mass of grilled onions -- is the dish that 90% of the Versailles crowd  orders.) Early tests have shown it to have just as much garlic power as the  original.  </P> <P>  Those who've never gone beyond the bird might be interested to know that  Versailles makes other good dishes: roast pork with the same garlic-onion  treatment as the chicken, tender oxtail and good Cuban coffee -- some of the  cheapest and strongest espresso on the Westside.

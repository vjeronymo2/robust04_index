The U.S. Trade Representative  Office delivered a sharp appraisal of Japan in an annual review  on U.S. trade policy priorities, vowing to put the task of  opening Japanese markets and securing Tokyo's compliance of past  trade agreements high on this year's U.S. trade agenda.    The trade report, compiled annually under congressional  requirement, placed Japan on top of a list of bilateral trade  policy actions that Washington plans to take this year.    In addition, the U.S. Government promised to seek  congressional approval of a new global trade pact concluded last  December under auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade (GATT).    Washington also vowed to expand regional trade through the  newly created three-nation free-trade zone in North America and  to foster U.S. trade and investment opportunities in  Asia-Pacific region.    Trade representative Mickey Kantor said the United States is  determined to make global trade a "two-way" street.    There can be "no something for nothing," Kantor said in  releasing this year's review of the U.S. trade agenda.    The U.S. Trade Representative Office (USTR) report took  issue  with Japan's market-opening efforts, saying Japan lags behind  other major industrial economies in terms of openness to imports  and to foreign direct investment.    Japan's trade policy, the report warned, will be held  accountable for economic ills in the world.    Japan's "enormous global current account surplus, combined  with its continuing resistance to both imports and new  competitors in key sectors, retards global recovery and  undermines political support for trade," the report said.    In another sharp rebuke on Japan's trade practice, the USTR  report literally accused the Japanese Government of not keeping  its word after signing a trade agreement.    "We presently have 33 trade agreements in effect with Japan,  unfortunately, very few are being implemented in the way that we  had envisioned," the report said.    The report said the U.S. Government cited Japan last month  for allegedly violating a 1989 trade agreement on cellular phone  service in Japan and vowed that Washington will put Japan's  observance of other trade agreements under close scrutiny.    "We are reviewing our other agreements with Japan, and will  not hesitate to act if they are not being implemented  effectively," the report said.    The report gives the first detailed account of the U.S.  trade  agenda on Japan following the breakdown of trade talks between  the two countries that marred the February 11 summit between  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton.    Washington has since revived a 1988 trade law provision,  known as the "Super 301," giving Clinton broad authority to  impose unilateral sanctions on Japan over trade disputes.    The Clinton administration is also poised next week to  publish a list of Japanese goods -- worth several hundred  million dollars -- that will be subject to U.S. sanctions if  there is no negotiated settlement over the cellular phone  dispute.    In testimony at Congress on Tuesday, Kantor raised the  possibility that up to eight Japanese industries would be  subject to retaliatory action under the Super 301 trade weapon.    Kantor identified wood, paper, flat glass, computers,  supercomputers, telecommunications, medical equipment and  insurance as business areas where he said U.S. firms face  barriers in penetrating the Japanese market.    The USTR report, however, indicated that the U.S. is still  hopeful of settling its trade disputes with Japan at the  negotiating table, particularly through the "framework" trade  process agreed to last July.    "We stand by the framework for a new economic partnership to  address these problems in a spirit of partnership," the report  said.</p>

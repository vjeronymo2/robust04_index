			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin gave his backing to  the policy aimed at restoring peace and security in Tajikistan  and at democratic reforms in the republic during his meeting  with Chairman of the Tajik Supreme Soviet Emomali Rakhmonov in  Moscow today.    The Russian-Tajik joint communique released by the Russian  Foreign Ministry said the two leaders had stressed the  importance of the first round of the talks between the Tajik  government and the Tajik opposition. These talks on national  reconciliation bring hope for a peace settlement of the  conflict, the statement underlined.    Yeltsin supported the position of the Tajik leadership  seeking continuation of the dialogue in order to establish a  democratic Tajikistan. This requires firm agreements on putting  an end to hostilities, on restoration and strengthening of  mutual confidence and on free return of all refugees to their  native land.    The communique emphasized that the parties had been deeply  concerned over the tense situation on the Tajik-Afghan border  and in Afghanistan and over the continuing armed provocations  from Afghan territory which threatened security in the whole  region.    The parties urged the Afghan military-political groups to  seek peace and accord in the country and to create atmosphere of  cooperation between the region's countries.    Yeltsin and Rakhmonov pointed out the important stabilizing  role played by the joint peacekeeping forces in Tajikistan.  They said joint efforts on defense of the southern borders and  primarily of the Tajik-Afghan section conformed with the  interests of all CIS states.    When discussing economic cooperation between Russia and  Tajikistan, Rakhmonov asked the Russian leadership to speed up  consideration of the issue on merging of the two countries'  monetary systems. He confirmed that Tajikistan was carrying out  its obligations on establishment of a single financial space.  It was decided that the Tajik and the Russian governments would  continue to work on the issue.    Russia said it was ready to continue economic and  humanitarian aid to Tajikistan and to enhance cooperation  between the two countries in order to develop their economic  potential and to meet social needs of the Tajik population.</p>

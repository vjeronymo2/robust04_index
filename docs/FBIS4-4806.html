			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Hanminjon Spokesman Denounces South Korean Authorities for </F> Mocking Envoys of Peace" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, April 2 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the  South Korean National Democratic Front [SKNDF] (Hanminjon) in a  commentary on March 30 denounced the South Korean authorities  for having blocked the Pyongyang trip of former presidents and  prime ministers and other high-level politicians of different  countries through Panmunjom, according to the radio Voice of  National Salvation from Seoul.    "This is a rude act of the `civilian' fascist group mocking  the envoys of peace from different countries, ignoring the  elementary international usage and courtesy and morality," the  spokesman said.    Noting that the Kim Yong-sam fascist group barred the  northern trip of the foreign envoys of peace through Panmunjom  by applying to them the uncouth fascist act of blocking the home  people's visit to the North, and thus made it quite plain that  South Korea is a barren land of human rights under the  "civilian" dictatorship and the Kim Yong-sam regime is an  anti-peace group, he said:    "The Kim Yong-sam group blocked their Pyongyang visit  because  it was deadly afraid that they might sympathize with the just  stand of the North which is pursuing a policy of independent  reunification and a nuclear-free peace policy which are totally  contrary to its flunkeyist splittist policy and war moves. This  fully shows which of the North and the South of the Korean  peninsula is a closed fascist society and which of them is a  democratic society, who seeks confrontation, war and division  and who wants peace and peaceful reunification."</p>

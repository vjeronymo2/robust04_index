			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Senior Lieutenant Oleg Groznetskiy of the </F> Northwestern Group of Forces: "Robbery Under Cover of  Misunderstandings. Provocations Against Russian Servicemen by  Latvian Home Defense Guard Continue"]    [Text] In the chronicle of actions by the Home Defense  Guard against Russian troops temporarily stationed on Latvian  territory, a UAZ-469 automobile was stopped by home defense  guards 27 November 1993 at around 1200. Under threat of the use  of weapons, the driver and the automobile were taken to the Home  Defense Guard 12th Battalion headquarters, where a R-838 radio  transmitter set was removed from the automobile.    In the area of Plavinas 14 December 1993 at 1200 a GAZ-66  automobile belonging to the courier-mail communications service,  which was transporting correspondence from Riga to Jekabpils,  was shot at with a small-bore weapon by unknown individuals  following behind in an automobile. As a result of the shooting,  a wheel was pierced. The camouflage uniform of the people doing  the shooting, as well as the color of the vehicle, provide  grounds for believing that they belonged to the Home Defense  Guard.    An officer from the Northwestern Group of Forces press  center  asked Mr. Juris Dalbinsh [name as transliterated], deputy chief  of staff of the Home Defense Guard, to comment on these and  other similar actions in respect of Russian servicemen.    "The incident involving the removal of the portable radio  transmitter was an annoying misunderstanding," Mr. Dalbinsh  explained. "The reason for it was that the home defense guards  had not made themselves familiar with the intergovernmental  agreements on the use of postal and electric communications and  Russian Federation Armed Forces radio frequencies. In this case  the home guards acted unlawfully, and therefore a court  investigation will be conducted and we will inform you of the  results in writing. The culprits will be disciplined. As for  the shooting at the Russian military vehicle 14 December, we  have no information about this. I specially got in touch with  the battalion on whose territory this incident supposedly took  place, and I found out that they were not given any tasks that  day, and were not even on patrol."    [Groznetskiy] "Mr. Dalbinsh, would you not admit the  possibility of the unsanctioned use of weapons by your  subordinates?"    [Dalbinsh] "No, that is out of the question. In broad  daylight, in a vehicle with `Home Defense Guard' symbols on it  -- that's going too far. We recently had a very serious  discussion with Latvian Republic President G. Ulmanis (the  president is the commander in chief of the Home Defense Guard --  O.G.) during which it was pointed out that it is impermissible  to use weapons without grounds for doing so. The Home Defense  Guard command drew the relevant conclusions: The requirements  concerning who can be issued with weapons have been made  tougher. However, people are human. Not everyone can bear the  burden of authority provided by weapons in a normal way; but we  will conduct the relevant work..."    Following the conversation with Mr. Juris Dalbinsh, another  report came in. As Major V. Turovskiy's household effects were  being transported along the Riga-Nizhniy Novgorod route on 23  December of last year in the area of Jekabpils, the KamAZ truck  was shot at with a small-bore pistol. The attackers were in a  light-gray Riga Bus Plant automobile bearing Home Defense Guard  emblems on its doors....</p>

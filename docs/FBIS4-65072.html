			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- According to President Boris Yeltsin,  Russia wants to have peaceful relations with all its neighboring  countries. In his toast at a dinner with Federal President  Richard von Weizsaecker, Yeltsin said in Bonn on Wednesday [11  May] at the beginning of his three-day visit to Germany: "For  the first time in a long time Russia is entering the  international stage as a major power that does not threaten  anybody."    Just like Germany, Russia wants to integrate all countries  of  the continent into European security structures. "It is  important that the fences and roadblocks, which have been dumped  on the garbage heap, do not reappear." Yeltsin added: "We are  sincerely trying to establish friendly ties with neighbors near  and far, with all those who feel committed to the ideals of  humanity and the standards set by international law." The head  of the Kremlin spoke out in favor of "trade without obstacles,"  and of economic integration in Europe.    Yeltsin said that "a historic reconciliation" was currently  taking place between Germany and Russia. "I am convinced that we  can eliminate the term `war' from the Russian-German vocabulary  for good." Yeltsin expressly praised the role of the outgoing  federal president. "Your successor will not have things easy  because he will be compared with Mr. Weizsaecker, who has set  very high standards." Weizsaecker managed to remain beyond the  emotions of everyday politics and managed to reconcile people,  Yeltsin concluded.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Philippe Reinhard: "French Cowardice"] </F>   [Text] The Strasbourg Parliament has voted in favor of  expanding the European Union [EU]. The EU, which is already  finding it difficult to function with 12 members is welcoming  four new members. It is doing so without having first amended  its institutional mechanisms. The British concept of Europe has  thus prevailed with German complicity. It must be said that  this peaceful "anschluss" is electorally profitable for Helmut  Kohl. But what have the French done?    A European Parliament at the end of its session -- half of  the deputies who voted in favor of expansion will no longer have  seats after the 12 June elections -- has therefore ratified this  European Munich [treaty]. Europe is hastily turning itself into  a European free trade association 37 years after the Treaty of  Rome. The British, who have constantly worked for this cause,  have reason to rejoice.    Only the French could prevent it from happening, for fairly  petty internal political reasons. And yet, on 14 April, Valery  Giscard d'Estaing [a member of the European Parliament]  presented the problem as it should be presented. He very  logically demanded that the reform of the EU's institutions  should precede the approval of expansion. "The rejection of the  institutional choice leads to the inevitable dilution of the  EU," he said. Europe has failed to reform its institutions with  12 members. It is difficult to see how it could do so with 16  in the future.    The French bear a grave responsibility in this matter. The  attitude of the European deputies from the RPR [Rally for the  Republic] is somewhat understandable. Most of them are so  hostile to European unity that anything which undermines it  pleases them. In so doing they are forgetting de Gaulle, who  rightly refused Britain's entry into the Common Market on 14  January 1963, to prevent Europe -- for which he cherished real  political ambitions (the Fouchet plan) -- from becoming a free  trade area. But we cannot expect the general's heirs to have his  grand vision. By accepting expansion, they have dealt a final  blow to Maastricht. It does not much matter to them that in so  doing they have killed Europe. God forgive them, they knew not  what they did.    The attitude of the UDF [French Democratic Union] is  infinitely more worthy of condemnation. For strictly domestic  reasons, because it does not want confrontation at a time when  it is drawing up its list with its RPR partners, Dominique  Baudis laboriously explained yesterday why he nonetheless  accepted a vote which will certainly paralyze European unity.  The mayor of Toulouse hopes that in future the European thread  can be taken up again through a Franco-German "initiative." The  CDU [Christian Democratic Union] has always had powerful  arguments with which to win over its younger French cousins.  For domestic policy reasons, Kohl's Europe is no longer that of  de Gaulle and Adenauer, but the old and dangerous "Mittel Europa  [Central Europe]." It is upsetting that the French Right is  also lending itself to the destruction of a great idea in this  way.</p>

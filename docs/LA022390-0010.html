			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> TORO BASEBALL TEAM GETS A QUICK FIX;  </P> <P> COLLEGE: CAL STATE DOMINGUEZ HILLS COACH GEORGE WING KNEW THE FASTEST WAY TO  IMPROVE HIS TEAM. HE STOCKED IT WITH JUNIOR COLLEGE TRANSFERS AND FEELS  CONFIDENT AS THE TOROS OPEN LEAGUE PLAY TODAY.  </P> <P> The quick fix is in at Cal State Dominguez Hills, where second-year baseball  Coach George Wing is generally pleased with the results turned in by his first  recruiting class.  </P> <P> The Toros begin California Collegiate Athletic Assn. play at 2:30 this  afternoon at Cal State Northridge with a 5-3-1 record. Northridge (2-0) will  visit Dominguez Hills on Saturday at 1 p.m.  </P> <P> Two Toro victories earlier this year were at the University of Arizona and UC  Santa Barbara, two Division I schools. Dominguez Hills was ranked as high as  13th in the nation before slipping to 24th this week.  </P> <P> "At this stage it is too early for rankings," Wing said. "I think Dominguez  Hills will have a real impact in the conference. Not a whole lot of people are  looking at us yet, but the guys have the right attitude."  </P> <P> Wing, hired so late in 1988 that he missed the entire recruiting season for his  1989 team, has rebuilt the Toros with 22 junior college players. The team  carries only five freshmen, none of whom have seen regular playing time.  </P> <P> In the future, Wing, a former junior college coach, wants to go after high  school seniors, but for the 1990 campaign it was important to put a winning  team on the field. Dominguez Hills, which captured back-to-back California  Collegiate Athletic Assn. titles in 1986 and '87 under former Coach Andy Lopez,  finished well below .500 the last two seasons.  </P> <P> "Last year it was a situation of taking the hand that was dealt me and seeing  what I could do," said Wing, who replaced Lopez in mid-July of 1988 from  Cosumnes River College in Sacramento.  </P> <P> On a potential future roster of 28 players, Wing hopes for a mix of 14 junior  college players and 14 freshmen.  </P> <P> "My plan now is to build with freshmen," he said. "But after last year's finish  (16-29-1), I felt that we needed to develop respect, for recruiting purposes,  and that's why I went the quick-fix route."  </P> <P> Building a team around transfers who have two years of college training behind  them is considered the fast way to turn a sagging program around. So far,  Wing's philosophy seems to be paying dividends.  </P> <P> "The guys have developed a very strong (fellowship)," Wing said. "All the JC  guys come from a familiar-type background; that is, they played at quality  programs on a college level. They came here all for the same thing: to play  baseball. It's easy for them to make the adjustment from one college to the  next."  </P> <P> Three players are having an immediate impact. Infielders Fred Camarena (.448)  and Johnny Blood (.382) and outfielder George Scott (.375) lead the regulars in  batting.  </P> <P> Said Wing: "Between them, there is always one that is getting on base, starting  something, always being a spark plug."  </P> <P> What the Toros have lacked is more hitting from the remainder of their lineup.  First baseman Bill Keep (.313) is the only other regular hitting above .300.  The team has added 10 points to its batting average in the last week, but .292  is not considered strong in college circles.  </P> <P> "We're still waiting on our power guys to get going," Wing said. "We have the  potential to be very, very explosive, but we have yet to see it."  </P> <P> The Toros have shown a propensity for falling behind early, then roaring back.  Dominguez Hills has been outscored 17-11 through nine games in the first three  innings, but in the middle innings it owns a 35-23 edge.  </P> <P> Said first-year offensive Coach Eric Mihkelson, a former Toro player: "I wasn't  excited at first with our offense. There wasn't any execution. But now we've  got things going good."  </P> <P> The seventh inning may prove to be the key in many Toro games this year, if  early trends continue. Dominguez Hills has scored just once in the stretch  frame this year, while opponents have managed eight runs.  </P> <P> That may change as the season progresses and starting pitchers grow stronger  and can go the distance more often. It could become a point of concern for  Wing, however.  </P> <P> Defensively, the team looks solid but not spectacular, Wing said. Dominguez  Hills has committed nine errors this season, three against Arizona.  </P> <P> Wing thought the Toros' pitching would be strong when he saw the team in winter  workouts. But so far, things haven't shaped up that way.  </P> <P> "I'm not convinced yet that we will be a dominating pitching staff," he said.  "In this conference, we have as good a chance as any team to win. But so far  we've been on a roller-coaster ride with our pitchers."  </P> <P> The staff was dealt a major blow about a month before the season began when ace  hurler Chuck Plumley quit.  </P> <P> "He just lost it in his heart," Wing said. "It wasn't a disagreement with us or  unhappiness with the program; he just didn't want to play anymore."  </P> <P> That still left 13 prospective pitchers in the fold. Left-handers Vincent  Aguilar (1-1) and Willie Navarette (1-1) have five starts between them. Lefty  Armando Gomez is 2-0 and occupies the third spot in the rotation. Wing looks  for right-hander Gilbert Diaz, a 10-game winner from Allan Hancock College, who  already has a save in relief, to see plenty of action, possibly as a starter.  If Diaz comes around, Wing would have the option of mixing up his left-handed  rotation.  </P> <P> "There's no question in my mind," he said. "The potential is there for us to be  a dominating force in the conference."  </P> <P> When the team is up to bat, Wing lets Mihkelson call the signals.  </P> <P> "He has played here and knows this field very well," the coach explained.  </P> <P> When he was hired, Wing took a long, hard look at the facilities in Carson and  realized that recruiting power-hitting lefties would be out of the question.  </P> <P> The Toro diamond sits on a mesa looking out toward the Palos Verdes Peninsula.  In the afternoon the ocean winds whip in against the hitters. Home runs to  right and center fields are few.  </P> <P> So Wing decided to build a team that can play "up the middle" -- a bunt-and-run  team, much like those Mihkelson is used to.  </P> <P> "I've geared the team toward handling the bat, the short game of hit and run,"  Wing said. "Power hitting is great on the road, but it doesn't do us any good  at home."  </P> <P> In the CCAA, defending national champion Cal Poly San Luis Obispo is ranked  fourth nationally this year. Struggling Cal Poly Pomona already has two losses  to 16th-ranked Northridge, but the Broncos remain No. 15. Wing, however, said  UC Riverside may be the team to beat.  </P> <P> But then, he said, don't count the Toros out. "We are a dark horse."  </P></p>

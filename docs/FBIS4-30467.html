			<p>BFN     [Text] Mr. Sam Rangsi, vice chairman of the FUNCINPEC  [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful,  and Cooperative Cambodia] party and economy and finance minister  of the two-headed government, stated that he supported Foreign  Minister Norodom Sirivut's position that outlawing the Khmer  Rouge is contrary to the king's idea. Mr. Sam Rangsi said that  if the National Assembly ratifies this law next July all the  budget will be used for military purposes and none will be left  for national reconstruction.</p>

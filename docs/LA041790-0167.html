			<p><P> April 17, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TITANS ATTEMPTING TO SAVE TWO TEAMS;  </P> <P> FULLERTON: FENCING AND MEN'S GYMNASTICS COULD STAY ALIVE IN FACE OF BUDGET CUTS  THROUGH EFFORTS BY CAMPUS AND COMMUNITY.  </P> <P> The Cal State Fullerton fencing and men's gymnastics teams, clinging to life in  the face of a proposed budget cut that would eliminate the programs, have a  little more hope to hold on to.  </P> <P> The school announced Monday that a coordinated effort by the campus and the  community has been launched to save the programs, which the Athletics Council  recently recommended be dropped to balance the 1990-91 athletic budget.  </P> <P> The campus campaign consists of efforts to pass a referendum that would  increase the Instructionally Related Activity Fee paid each semester by all  students. Students will vote on April 26-27 whether to raise the fee from $10  to $15 a semester.  </P> <P> If the referendum passes, an additional $240,000 would be generated annually  for the IRA fund, which supplements co-curricular activities such as athletics,  forensics and the student newspaper.  </P> <P> Fullerton Athletic Director Ed Carroll said the department would request a  portion of those funds for gymnastics and fencing. Fullerton President Jewel  Plummer Cobb makes the final decision on how IRA funds are allotted.  </P> <P> The community effort to save the programs includes solicitation of several  corporate donors and a Sports Save-a-Thon, a fund-raiser scheduled for May  17-19 at the Anaheim Hilton Hotel. According to Carroll, an additional $158,000  is needed annually to fund men's gymnastics and men's and women's fencing.  </P> <P> "We very much want to save these outstanding programs," Cobb said in a  statement issued by the school. "In the coming weeks, I will devote my serious  and undivided attention to the athletics budget situation and strategies for  keeping the programs in place."  </P> <P> Cobb has set a May 21 deadline to raise the funds and will make a decision then  regarding the future of the programs.  </P> <P> Dick Wolfe, men's gymnastics coach, was encouraged by the school's efforts, but  the May 21 deadline has caused a new set of problems. Wolfe had expected a  final decision from Cobb this week and already had begun making contingency  plans for his gymnasts should the program be cut. Nine of his 10 team members  are underclassmen.  </P> <P> Now, the delay has forced him to put off those efforts, and Wolfe fears May 21  might be too late for his gymnasts to secure scholarships at other schools.  </P> <P> "It's already late now," he said.  </P> <P> Wolfe, in his 22nd year as gymnastics coach, wasn't overly excited by the news.  </P> <P> "I hope it works, but at the same time, there's nothing concrete for me or my  athletes," he said. "I'm not happy or unhappy. I've been on a roller-coaster  ride, and I try not to get too caught up with things."  </P> <P> The men's gymnastics team finished sixth in the recent NCAA Western Regional  and will be sending two athletes, Bill Barham and Eli Rodriguez, to this  weekend's NCAA championships at Minneapolis. The Titans won College Division  national championships in 1971, 1972 and 1974.  </P> <P> The women's fencing team won a national title in 1973. Both the men's and  women's teams are coached by Heizaburo Okawa, who was a member of Japan's  Olympic team in 1960, 1964 and 1968.  </P> <P> "Right now, I feel much better about the situation, because earlier it seemed  like we had no chance," Okawa said. "This is a good indication that they're  willing to save the program."  </P> <P> Carroll, the Athletics Council chairman, said he is cautiously optimistic the  department will reach its goal.  </P> <P> "We're committed to finding a way to make it happen," Carroll said. "We have a  lot of irons in the fire and hope a combination of these (fund-raising efforts)  will make it possible."  </P></p>

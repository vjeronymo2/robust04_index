			<p><P> January 15, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIET JEWS SEEN NEEDING LAND IN GAZA, WEST BANK  </P> <P> Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Sunday that Israel has to hold on to the  occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip for a mass wave of Jewish immigration from  the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Government officials predict that at least 300,000 Soviet Jews will move to  Israel in the next three years as a result of new Soviet emigration policies  and new U.S. restrictions on immigration.  </P> <P> Shamir said the sudden influx of Soviet Jews proves time is on Israel's side  and will change the face of the Jewish state, making it "bigger, better and  stronger."  </P> <P> "The Arabs around us are embarrassed. They are in a mood of defeat, stricken  with fear," the 74-year-old leader told members of his right-wing Likud Party.  </P> <P> "They see the success of Zionism and they have no answer for it. They have no  cure. We have an answer, and of course it is not a Palestinian state. For the  big immigration, we must have the land of Israel and we have to fight for it,  struggle for it."  </P> <P> Asked later if the government will settle Soviet Jews in the occupied  territories, site of a 25-month-old Palestinian uprising, he told reporters:  </P> <P> "We will need a lot of room to absorb everyone, and every immigrant will go  where he wants."  </P> <P> Shamir's statements launched his campaign to defeat three hard-line Likud  ministers challenging him for retracting the dismissal of Science Minister Ezer  Weizman over alleged contacts with the Palestine Liberation Organization.  </P> <P> Trade Minister Ariel Sharon, architect of Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon,  Housing Minister David Levy and Economics Minister Yitzhak Modai forced Shamir  to convene Likud's central committee early next month.  </P> <P> Shamir said: "Everything is about to change here. With all the waves of  immigration that will come . . . the state will be different, will look  different. In another five or 10 years, we will not know it."  </P> <P> About 70,000 Jewish settlers now live among the 1.7 million Palestinians in the  occupied territories. Israeli rightists say mass immigration can help change  the demographic balance there, strengthening Israel's presence.  </P></p>

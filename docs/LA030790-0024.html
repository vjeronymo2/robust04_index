			<p><P> March 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNIFICATION IS NOT A ONE-WAY STREET;  </P> <P> GERMANY: AS THE TWO STATES GROW TOGETHER AGAIN, EAST GERMANS WILL HAVE  CONSIDERABLE IMPACT ON THEIR WESTERN RELATIVES.  </P> <P> The nature of German society has been a key to European security for three  centuries. Yet as East Germany collapses into the lap of West Germany, most  observers seem to have equated unification with an extension of West German  society to the East. Little attention has been paid to the ways in which the  East Germans will change the West German society to which others in the West  have grown accustomed.  </P> <P> A unified Republic of Germany will not only have a different name than the  current Federal Republic; it will be a very different society. As the two  German states grow together again, the East Germans will have considerable  impact on their Western relatives.  </P> <P> This has already been evident. The clear call for German unification by the new  East German Social Democratic Party, or SPD, shocked many in the West German  SPD, who for years had toyed with the idea of recognizing East Germany as a  separate, sovereign country. The conservative alliance in East Germany, to take  another example, is clear in its defense of the Oder-Neisse line as the  German-Polish border, in contrast to its Western partners, the Christian  Democratic Union and the Christian Social Union and in particular Chancellor  Helmut Kohl. Until Tuesday, his vague utterances only heightened fears in  Poland and elsewhere of the potential revisionist aims of a unified Germany.  </P> <P> There are other examples. Given their communist heritage, the East Germans are  sure to press their West German partners to prohibit any neo-fascist or extreme  right-wing political activity in any part of Germany. Although it is doubtful  that they could muster the strength to pass a constitutional ban on such  activities, they will force an important debate in German society on  neo-fascist activities.  </P> <P> East Germans, who have grown up with an extensive social-welfare system, will  also exert strong pressure in the new Germany to deepen and widen the already  substantial social underpinnings of the strong West German economy. Unification  could mean a striking move by the new Republic of Germany toward an economy  that would combine robust capitalism with one of the world's most generous and  extensive networks of social benefits, services and payments. The new Germany,  in fact, could soon become the proponent and model of a successful third way  between unfettered capitalism and the shackles of Stalinist socialism.  </P> <P> In East Germany, neutrality has always beckoned as an expression of  emancipation from the Soviet Union and the division of Germany. Now that both  are happening, the image of neutrality shimmers invitingly. West Germans, bound  to the West, are likely to prevail, but there will be a heated debate on  Germany's role in the heart of Europe.  </P> <P> Believe it or not, East Germans are also likely to spark a more  individualistic, grass-roots style of democracy than has existed in West German  society. In West Germany, the rise of citizens' initiatives since the 1970s has  been tightly linked to the emergence of the environmentally oriented Greens. In  East Germany, the opposition groups that blossomed last fall have been distinct  from the East German Greens. The East German citizens' movements have been  strident supporters of local democracy and popular initiatives and referendums.  They are quite skeptical of West Germany's political machine, which is  dominated by the major parties and oiled by mutual favor, loyalty and tight  discipline. East Germany's embryonic brand of participatory democracy could  spread westward.  </P> <P> Some negatives will also influence the scene. Even though ousted Communist  leader Erich Honecker had always called East Germany the "anti-fascist state,"  the regime considered as taboo the growing signs of a marginal, indigenous  neo-fascist movement. As a result, the Communist government never allowed the  East German people themselves to go through the difficult process of digesting  the Nazi past. Second, traditional German-Slavic enmity permeates East German  culture. Relations between ordinary Poles and West Germans have been far better  for many years than between Poles and their East German "allies."  </P> <P> German emotions and energies will be absorbed by these and other issues. One  thing is certain, though. Germany -- and Europe -- won't ever be the same  again.  </P></p>

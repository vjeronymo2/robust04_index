			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi; date and place not </F> given--live or recorded]    [Excerpts] It is my pleasure to be here where you are  stationed and where you are carrying out pioneering work on the  frontline, constructing an advanced trench and confrontation  line and an historic fortress on our Mediterranean, the Arab  sea, coast. You are fortifying the coast. You are the first  battalion of the sons of our people to undertake this kind of  voluntary work. You have left your family, your children, and  your private work. [passage omitted]    We offer this as an example to the rest of the Libyan people  that our people are capable of carrying out the necessary work  by relying on inner resources. You have paved the way for the  Libyan people with this pioneering work and the attendance from  all parts of the jamahiriyah. [passage omitted]    This presence has given comaraderie its true meaning. This  comaraderie is historic and this group is historic. People get  to know each other then forget each other, meet and separate,  forget each other, and memories fade. All except for this  comaraderie. The page of this comaraderie has not been closed.  We have decided to leave this page open in order to record in  it the work we want done by our will, and open to our children  and grandchildren to record further work on the path of this  historic comaraderie. [passage omitted]    Consequently, this comaraderie has entered the annals of  history. For my part, I will make a pledge and in honoring this  pledge to those who have known me or who have been my comrades,  I will make every effort to prevent any cause for regret that he  has known me or has been my comrade. I am committed to this  pledge. I am committed to this. I will try not to let anyone,  his family, or his children at any time regret knowing this  person or being his comrade. On the contrary, I want those who  have known me or who been my comrades to praise God for that  comaraderie and acquaintance. I want his children, his family,  and his grandchildren also to praise God for that acquaintance  and comaraderie -- except for those who have been unfair to  themselves. This applies equally to comrades from the days of  study and those who subsequently joined the death convoy  [qafilat al-mawt] at military college or the army -- except for  those who have betrayed themselves.    Those who betray comaraderie and their comrades or who  abandon and turn against comaraderie, their guilt is their own.  This is an historic matter. I am being hard on myself in order  not to let any comrade suffer regrets about comaraderie. No,  those who have not been our comrades may regret it and say: I  wish I knew those people, I wish I were a comrade of those  people, and I wish I were one of those comrades. As for the  comrades themselves, I want them and their children to praise  God for having been comrades and becoming one of the comrades.    In fact, we are writing something into our history that is  regrettably missing; it is now missing in this nation. There is  nothing but ingratitude, repudiation, hypocrisy, liquidating  comrades, forgetting the past, and obliterating good memories.  We have seen these things in Arab revolutions and coups, Arab  political systems, and Arab political parties. Everything  around the Arab political arena has produced nothing but  tragedy, ingratitude, repudiation, liquidation, idolization, and  oblivion. Those things will be gone with the wind and those  pages will be closed. Furthermore, they will be thrown into the  garbage can and into oblivion.    With this comaraderie we are giving comaraderie its sacred  meaning. I believe that this nation needs...[pauses] is morally  bankrupt and this may be the reason for bankruptcy in other  areas. [passage omitted]    The work you are doing will strengthen the missing morals  and  the meaning of loyalty and will give history a meaning. This is  the comaraderie of men and it is vastly different from all other  comaraderies which are bad and will lead to perversity, regret,  and sorrow. One would regret having been a comrade of that  person. [passage omitted]    We feel sorry for those who have been unfair to themselves  and who have betrayed comaraderie. However, perehaps some  people think that we are reffering to a particular comrade when  we talk about those who have betrayed comaraderie. Things like  that come from those who joined later and those who joined us at  other stages and for other reasons. However, all those people  are surprised that those comrades who have remained loyal,  revolutionary, and sincere for 30 years. None of us  betrayed...[pauses] None of the comrades...[pauses] We have  known each other since 1956 and 1959 when we sat down and  planned the revolution, staged demonstrations, and mobilized the  vital forces for the people's revolution. None othose comrades  deviated.    The fact is that we should draw a line between this  historic comaraderie and the military among whom I formed a  movement within the armed forces to stage a revolution in 1969  to lead the Libyan people. This is what happened. [passage  omitted]    When people in the military go astray and start having  fascist aspirations, this is to be expected and should not  affect our comaraderie at all. When an officer whose rank is  highter than mine, who took part with me in the movement, two  months later wanted to turn against the revolution, conspire, or  do something against it, this has nothing to do with you in my  assessment.    The fascist spirit among the military is well known. It is  always inclined to tyranny and even conspiracy and so on.  [passage omitted]    As you have seen, all the attempts of the fascists since the  advent of the revolution have failed. Why is that? Because  they are facing a people's revolution. They thought that the  revolution started when Mu'ammar Al-Qadhdhafi started mobilizing  cadets in the military academy and officers in the armed forces.  [passage omitted]    I found that all those students in the schools were ready,  for instance, to demonstrate for a Pan-Arab or national cause,  and I commissioned this or that cell and told them to organize  for revolution.    Now you are spreading this atmosphere among the Libyan  people. People are now regaining their consciousness. Many of  them are regaining their consciousness. Even those who  conspired against the revolution and those whom we pardoned, are  now saying: Brothers, how wrong we were! [passage omitted]    I really praise God that you are all happy with this  comradeship and that you say: Thank God that we were comrades.  Your children are happy, your families are happy. Our  comradeship is a source of pride for you, your children, and  your families, a source of personal and family honor. [passage  omitted]    You have actually proved that it is not merely a matter of  shouting slogans or talking, but one of pioneering work. We  believe that your Libyan brothers will follow in your footsteps  and affirm that you have opened the way for them. Crowds of  Libyans will come forward for voluntary work, to fortify the  coast or to build the railroad. This railroad must be built to  link the Arab homeland and to serve Arab unity despite the  circumstances imposed on us, despite the colonialists and those  who challenge us.    We must transform this crisis into positive work and  transform the disadvantage to an advantage through our will. We  must defy them and say to them that in the midst of these  circumstances the more you increase your challenges, the more we  will pose a challenge; we will do things which we did not do  when there was no challenge. We will become more stubborn and  we will defy them with work.    The Libyan coast should eventually -- and I cannot set a  date  -- be such that they the enemies will exclude it from their  plans for landing.    They are looking for the easy land, the paved land, the  sandy  land which will offer no resistance, and they would like to have  the upper hand. They want profit without loss. They want  something without loss. We have to show them that the loss will  stem from thinking of committing an aggression against Libya and  that the Libyan coast will be their graveyard.    Here we are actually digging. As I said earlier, we are not  only digging trenches and canals in order to use the sea water  to drown the coast. We are digging a graveyard for the enemy if  he comes to this land. In fact, my inspection of this region  today has revealed to me things about which I was talking with  Muftah and the others. The inspection revealed that there is a  fertile land, rain falls every year in the region, and there are  water springs and water wells, like this well here, which are  the extension of Ayn Tawurgha'. We thought that these lagoons we  constructed using sea water could become fish farms, and at the  same time become fortifications for the coast. All this land  could become farms. We thought that one day modern houses could  be built -- I mean a house in every area, and the owner of the  house would have either a fish farm, a vineyard, palm trees, or  grazing land. This is a region of rich grazing land and we  could plant vineyards, fig plantations, and so on. We could  introduce fish farms.    Eventually, this place will not only be profit-making.  Whoever agrees to settle here will be a frontline settler.  Those who settle in this region will be frontline settlers.  They will have a permanent and historic bond to settle in this  region, defend it, exploit it and benefit from it.    Anyway, I am happy -- very happy -- to be among my comrades.  Please convey my greetings to your families. May our  comradeship continue for ever.</p>

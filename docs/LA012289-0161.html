			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RACING AT SANTA ANITA;  </P> <P> VICTORY BY GOODBYE HALO IN EL ENCINO MAKES FOR A HAPPY DAY  </P> <P> Pat Day inadvertently lost the mount on Goodbye Halo midway through last year,  but he's not about to let it happen again.  </P> <P> On Goodbye Halo's back for the first time since the filly and the jockey won  the Kentucky Oaks last May at Churchill Downs, Day rode her to a half-length  win over T.V. of Crystal in the $104,700 El Encino Stakes Saturday before a  crowd of 8,956 at Santa Anita.  </P> <P> Savannah's Honor was third, 1 1/2 lengths behind Goodbye Halo, and it was  another 2 lengths back to Variety Baby in a race reduced to 4 starters by the  scratch of Seattle Smooth.  </P> <P> After Goodbye Halo's victory in the Kentucky Oaks, the 4-year-old daughter of  Halo and Pound Foolish, a Sir Ivor mare, won 2 more major races with Jorge  Velasquez in the saddle. At the end of the year, Eddie Delahoussaye rode  Goodbye Halo in 4 losing races, 3 of those on grass -- a surface the filly has  shown she doesn't like.  </P> <P> Day, fourth in the national jockey standings last year, probably would have  added to his $11.6-million purse total had he not been separated from Goodbye  Halo. A month after the Kentucky Oaks, the 35-year-old rider took a call on  another filly, Costly Shoes, for the Mother Goose at Belmont Park, because he  heard that Goodbye Halo was going to run in a grass race at Hollywood Park the  same weekend.  </P> <P> Instead, trainer Charlie Whittingham ran Goodbye Halo in the Mother Goose and  she won for Velasquez. Day finished seventh aboard Costly Shoes.  </P> <P> "I'll work overtime to see that I stay with her the rest of this year," Day  said Saturday, after Goodbye Halo won for the 9th time in 16 starts, earned  $60,200 and increased her career earnings to almost $1.3 million for co-owners  Arthur Hancock III and Alex G. Campbell Jr. Her time for the 1 1/16 miles was  1:41 4/5, which was the same time Lady's Secret posted in the stake in 1986, en  route to horse-of-the-year honors.  </P> <P> All 4 of the 4-year-old fillies in the El Encino held the lead at one time or  another. T.V. of Crystal broke the fastest and after a half-mile she dropped  back to second behind Variety Baby.  </P> <P> Toward the end of the backstretch, Savannah's Honor dragged Gary Stevens  through a hole between the 2 leaders and shot to the front. Goodbye Halo and  Day, not far back at any point, were also moving by then. Goodbye Halo,  carrying 124 pounds to T.V. of Crystal's 117, was closing on the outside and  she collared the leader inside the eighth pole.  </P> <P> "After that, she got a little leg-weary," Day said. "But she does what's  necessary to win. She had been off 6 weeks and was carrying a lot of weight.  But one thing you know about Charlie -- when he sends a horse over, you know  they're ready and you can ride them with a fair amount of confidence."  </P> <P> Both Day and Chris McCarron, who rode T.V. of Crystal, had been on vacation  before they resumed riding Saturday. Day was riding snowmobiles at his mother's  farm in Colorado, and McCarron had been skiing in Utah.  </P> <P> "My filly ran dynamite," McCarron said. "She gave it everything she had. At the  five-sixteenths pole, I thought I might be riding for third, but at the eighth  pole I thought I still might win it. Then Goodbye Halo just put it in  overdrive."  </P> <P> Stevens had trouble getting Savannah's Honor to relax in the French-raced  filly's third U.S. start.  </P> <P> "I didn't really want to be on the lead down the backstretch," Stevens said. "I  was happy where I was, in third, but Pat (and Goodbye Halo) came up on her hip,  and she just took off between horses."  </P> <P> After winning the first race she ever ran, last June at Hollywood Park, T.V. of  Crystal won 2 stakes and wound up earning $120,000 for trainer Donn Luby.  </P> <P> After the El Encino, Luby was being sarcastic. "She's better than an empty  stall," he said. "She couldn't run any better than she did today. She never had  a breather, they all took a shot at her. She should be tough coming back."  </P> <P> Goodbye Halo will try to win the seventh major race of her career when she runs  in the $200,000 La Canada at Santa Anita on Feb. 4. The day before, Day, who  rides mainly in the Midwest, will be in Arkansas to ride on the opening card at  Oaklawn Park. That shouldn't interfere with his travel plans to Los Angeles.  He'd take a snowmobile here just for the chance to ride Goodbye Halo again.  </P> <P> Horse Racing Notes  </P> <P> Putting, whose record has been punctuated by more second-place finishes than  victories in the past year, will be favored today in the San Marcos Handicap.  Putting had 5 seconds and 2 wins in 13 starts last year and hasn't won since he  took the San Marino Handicap last March. . . . Trainer Brian Mayberry, who has  7 winners from 29 starters at the meeting, won Saturday with Pricey Mac, who  paid $107.40, the highest win price of the season. A $50,000 claim last  October, Pricey Mac hadn't won since early last year. . . . Another of  Mayberry's winners, Sitting Appeal, is expected to run in the San Vicente for  3-year-old colts Wednesday.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TENTATIVE ACCORD COULD LIQUIDATE LINCOLN'S PARENT  </P> <P> American Continental Corp.'s creditors said Friday they reached a tentative  agreement with the federal government to liquidate the notorious thrift holding  company and oust its controversial chairman, Charles H. Keating Jr.  </P> <P> If it wins court approval, the pact will provide 22,000 mostly elderly  bondholders and assorted other creditors with $21 million in at least partial  repayment of the $200 million they invested in the Phoenix company, which is  operating in Chapter 11 bankruptcy. American Continental is the former parent  of the failed Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine.  </P> <P> A representative for Keating said the executive plans to resign as American  Continental's chairman and chief executive next week to head a court-approved  shareholders committee, which will take part in the Bankruptcy Court  negotiations over the company's fate.  </P> <P> The agreement would settle significant differences between creditors and  Resolution Trust Corp., the government agency operating Lincoln.  </P> <P> Regulators hold Lincoln up as the epitome of everything that has gone wrong in  the thrift industry. They estimate that the S&amp;L will cost taxpayers $2  billion, one of the costliest thrift clean-ups in the nation. Federal  authorities have launched an all-out attack on Keating through a series of  criminal investigations and a $1.1-billion racketeering suit against him and  his top executives. Keating denies any wrongdoing.  </P> <P> Details of the agreement have not been worked out but are expected to be  announced by Friday, when the unsecured creditors' committee has said it will  file its reorganization plan. history.  </P> <P> The pact provides that American Continental's "estate will be liquidated and  that those proceeds will be distributed first to the creditors," said Michael  Manning, a Phoenix lawyer for Resolution Trust. The creditors and the  government also would seek the removal of Keating and all top American  Continental executives.  </P> <P> The agreement in principle was announced in U.S. District Court in Phoenix and  came as a surprise to Keating and his associates, who knew only that the  creditors' committee and the government agency had been talking for the last  two months.  </P> <P> "RTC has simply refused to negotiate with us," said James J. Feder, a Los  Angeles lawyer for American Continental.  </P> <P> The agreement between the creditors and the government does not affect the  racketeering lawsuit against Keating and others; American Continental's  challenge of last year's federal takeover of Lincoln; and the lawsuits filed  against Keating and others by holders of American Continental's debt  securities.  </P> <P> Those bondholders make up the bulk of the company's creditors and would benefit  most under the agreement. Though the bondholders' payment hasn't been  determined, lawyers in the case said talks have put the figure at about $14  million, or nearly 7 cents on the dollar. The other $7 million would go to  other creditors.  </P> <P> The Bondholders are mostly elderly Lincoln depositors who were persuaded to buy  nearly $200 million of the parent company's debt securities at the S&amp;L's 29  Southern California branches. Many say they were misled into believing that the  securities were insured or "as safe as Lincoln.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 19, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TEEN-AGER SHOT OUTSIDE LA JOLLA YMCA CLUB  </P> <P> An 18-year-old man was in serious condition Monday after being shot in the  stomach outside a La Jolla youth club following an argument with two other men,  police said.  </P> <P> Johnny McClure was in the Firehouse Teen and Youth Center about 11 p.m.  Saturday when the argument began. Security personnel asked the men to leave,  said Elaine Andersen, operations manager of the under-21 club. She said McClure  stayed inside for a while after the others left. He was shot as he walked down  the street.  </P> <P> Two shots were fired from a red Volkswagen Scirocco, and one of them hit  McClure, said police spokesman Bill Robinson. McClure was taken to Scripps  Memorial Hospital in La Jolla.  </P> <P> Andersen said it was the first time a shooting had occurred in the area around  the 7-month-old club, part of the La Jolla YMCA.  </P> <P> "We don't serve alcohol here. We play music and have a light show."  </P> <P> She said McClure had been in the club before, but the other two men were not  known to the patrons or the security officers.  </P> <P> "The young men were having an argument, and they ended it here. . . . It's a  horrible thing that happened," she said. YOLANDA RODRIGUEZ  </P></p>

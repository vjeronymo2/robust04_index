			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Finance and the Family: Stale result for baking giant - The week ahead MONDAY: Associated British Foods, the UK's biggest baker, will be hard pressed to make pre-tax profits for the year to September any higher than the Pounds 338m a year earlier. Some analysts are looking for as much as a Pounds 40m fall. Improved food and sugar profits in the UK are likely to be offset by falling profits in Australia and a further deterioration in finances. Net interest earned might be halved from the previous year's Pounds 61m but the dividend is expected to rise 0.3p to 6.8p for the year. MONDAY: The City forecasts pre-tax profits at BAA to rise from Pounds 237m to around Pounds 262m in the first half. The group, which operates seven UK airports, is expected to show strong growth in traffic but analysts will be looking to see if Stansted, London's third airport, has moved into profit. TUESDAY: British Airways should make pre-tax profits between Pounds 210m and Pounds 220m in the second quarter, up from Pounds 172m last year. Analysts expect the core airline business to perform very well. But the performances of the US carrier USAir, BA's French affiliate TAT and its German partner Deutsche BA, will all come under scrutiny. TUESDAY: Investment bank SG Warburg will announce earnings for the six months ended September 30 and securities analysts are offering no prizes for guessing the results. Last month, Warburg put out a profits warning in which it said that it expected to report earnings of Pounds 55m to Pounds 65m for the period, down sharply from the Pounds 148.8m in the same period in 1993. TUESDAY: Marks and Spencer, the UK's most profitable retailer, is expected to announce another strong set of results, with interim pre-tax profits rising from Pounds 307.8m to around Pounds 355m. But the figures could be distorted slightly by last year's 53-week period and an early Easter holiday. Analysts are concerned about trading levels and start-up costs on the continent. TUESDAY: Anglian Water is forecast to show interim pre-tax profits of about Pounds 110m (Pounds 100.5m) when it reports, and an 8.5 per cent increase in the pay-out to 7.9p. Treatment of infrastructure charges could affect the headline numbers. WEDNESDAY: Commercial Union is forecast to show pre-tax profits of about Pounds 285m compared with Pounds 144m last time. The results will be the first since the acquisition of French insurer Groupe Victoire, though its impact is expected to be marginal at this stage. WEDNESDAY: Half-year results from Amersham International, which makes diagnostic pharmaceuticals, should present a clearer picture of the company's fortunes than did last year's, which were distorted by acquisition. A good performance from its product, Metastron, should help the company record a pre-tax profit of at least Pounds 20m, compared with Pounds 17.4m last time, and allow a 14 per cent rise in the dividend from 4.4p to 5p. WEDNESDAY: Analysts are forecasting interim pre-tax profits in the range of Pounds 550m to Pounds 580m for Cable &amp; Wireless - which at mid-point is about 11 per cent up on last year's Pounds 509m. Continued strong growth at Hongkong Telecom, far and away C&amp;W's largest profit earner, will be offset by slower growth at Mercury, C&amp;W's UK subsidiary, which is fighting hard against rising UK competition and fast declining BT prices. Start-up costs for ventures such as Mercury One-2-One will also affect non-Hong Kong earnings. THURSDAY: Second-quarter pre-tax profits at British Telecommunications are expected to fall between Pounds 750m and Pounds 800m, after about Pounds 100m in redundancy charges but before a Pounds 75m re-purchase of bonds. That compares with Pounds 743m last year after redundancy charges, giving underlying profits growth of about 4.5 per cent. Although other cable operators are advancing, most analysts believe that BT is responding positively to growing competition in the British market. Cellnet, BT's mobile joint venture with Securicor, is expected to report a strong performance. THURSDAY: Royal Insurance is expected to confirm its recovery from heavy losses early in the 1990s with a pre-tax profit figure of about Pounds 310m against Pounds 113m last time. THURSDAY: Northumbrian Water is likely to show a substantial rise to about Pounds 39m (Pounds 22.6m) in spite of non-core losses, and could follow the example set by Thames Water with an 11 per cent dividend increase to 9p. THURSDAY: ScottishPower will be expected to offer some indications of future dividend growth after the recent electricity price review. Forecasts are for about Pounds 124m (Pounds 115.7m) in pre-tax profits, with an increase in the dividend from 4.13p to about 4.6p. THURSDAY: Burton, the clothing retail group, is forecast to announce pre-tax profits of between Pounds 40m and Pounds 43m for the year (Pounds 18.5m). Margins at the multiples, which include Burtons, Dorothy Perkins and Top Shop, are thought to have been squeezed. The best performer is again expected to be the department store Debenhams.</p>

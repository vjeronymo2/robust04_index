			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Emerging Markets: Investing in eastern Europe The surge of financial investment into the former communist bloc is continuing with the decision by Invesco, the fund manager, to raise an extra Dollars 75m for its East Europe Development Fund, writes Nicholas Denton. The new injection will take the money raised by EEDF since its foundation in 1990 to Dollars 115m and will lift the resources of funds focused on the region close to Dollars 1bn. EEDF's net asset value will rise to about Dollars 170m, propelling it into the top two of emerging market funds specialising in eastern Europe, nearly matching CS First Boston's Central European Growth Fund. The Baring group, which is issuing and placing the new shares, is marketing EEDF as the best performing regional institutional investor. Micropol, the fund measurement company, has named EEDF as the best performer in its group over one and three years. An early move into the booming Polish market helped EEDF's net asset value double between September 1993 and March 1994 and the fund has held on to most of the gains. More recently launched funds like Baring Emerging Europe Trust and Central European Growth Fund invested into markets that were coming off their peaks. Their short-term performance has inevitably been mixed. Specialised emerging markets funds have been more active than pension funds in eastern Europe and especially the former Soviet Union. Stock markets in the region are immature and the regional funds have been more willing to make unquoted investments. But even venturesome investors like the regional funds have been deterred by insecure custody and settlement in Russia. Fund managers say it is the largest single deterrent to financial investment in eastern Europe's largest market.</p>

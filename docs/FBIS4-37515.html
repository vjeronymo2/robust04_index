			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "A Longer View"] </F>   [Text] The Russians have reportedly offered India an  improved Sukhoy fighter bomber aircraft, an earlier version of  which -- Su-27 -- has already been supplied to China. The Su-30  or Su-35 is an advanced version with air-to-air refuelling  capability with impressive performance characteristics. India  has had a satisfying experience with Russian aircraft and it is  therefore natural for Russia, now anxious to earn foreign  exchange, to offer its latest product to the Indian Air Force  [IAF]. In the past, the lAF's approach to acquisitions of new  aircraft have been rather ad hoc; decisions taken to produce  some categories of aircraft under licence have not resulted in  actual production and plans for doing so have been abandoned.  In some other cases, the acquisitions have been in driblets  with the result that the country has not got the best possible  terms that could have been obtained if the entire purchase had  been negotiated in one lot. Therefore, there is a good case now  to work out a long-term plan for the future composition of the  IAF over the next 25 years and examine whether the Russian  Sukhoy offer fits into that scheme. Unlike at the time when the  Mirage 2000 was purchased, we are not under any immediate threat  from new acquisitions by Pakistan, which might disturb the  balance of air power in the sub-continent. No doubt there is  the possibility of the US sale of F-16s to Pakistan. But that  alone cannot be allowed to determine the choice of the next  generation of high performance aircraft into the IAF.    It is obvious that new Soviet aircraft will not be available  on easy terms of credit as earlier. Since India has to pay in  hard currency there has to be a rigorous cost-benefit evaluation  of various options and the technology transfer and countertrade  arrangements that could be available. Some may argue that  Indian purchases of aircraft will provide a justification to the  Americans to release F-16s to Pakistan. That argument can be  turned around. Since there is the threat of a possible US sale  of F-16s to Pakistan, India should explore all avenues and be  ready to rectify any imbalance that may be caused by the F-16  transfer. Arms transfers are highly visible symbols of  political relationship. In the post-Gorbachev era, Indo-Russian  ties do not enjoy the same degree of closeness they once did.  The Sukhoy offer would have to be influenced by the manner in  which Russia agrees to solve the problem of supply of spares for  equipment bought in the past. Russia will now have to prove that  it is a reliable and dependable source of supply of armaments in  the future.</p>

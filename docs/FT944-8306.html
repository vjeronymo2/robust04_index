			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Business Travel: New airport for Berlin A giant new airport for Berlin should be built far outside the city because sites closer to the centre were unsuitable, an official study by Brandenburg state says. Nuisance to residents and environmental concerns meant expanding Berlin's Schoenefeld airport eastward was not a good idea. The report advises against Schoenefeld because many people would have to be rehoused and the extra passenger traffic would cause chaos. It recommends two outlying sites - Sperenberg or Jueterbog - both about 31 miles away. Berlin has three airports: Tegel (over-crowded), Tempelhof (rarely used) and Schoenefeld.</p>

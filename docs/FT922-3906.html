			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / UK Company News: A question of management achievement - Strength of leadership is central to the future of Dowty IT IS the witching hour for Mr Bruce Ralph, chief executive of Dowty, the ailing aircraft landing gear and information technology group. By 1 o'clock tomorrow shareholders will have decided whether to reject the hostile Pounds 510.8m bid from TI Group or to give Mr Ralph another chance to turn the company around. If they accept the offer, Dowty will join Hawker Siddeley on a growing list of famous British engineering names swallowed by acquisitive conglomerates. TI, for its part, will join the FT-SE 100 index, becoming the UK's second-largest engineering group behind British Aerospace, and the sleepy atmosphere that some argue has settled over Cheltenham's largest company would be rudely blown away. As tomorrow's deadline approaches it seems that TI is heading for victory, even though institutional shareholders are not convinced the price is a knockout blow. Mr Christopher Lewinton, TI chairman, could not have struck at a worse time for Dowty, struggling as it was to restructure a recession-hit aerospace business. Not only was Dowty forced to report dreadful interim figures last year when it was already one of the most frequently tipped takeover targets. The company also failed to spend enough time preventing analysts from further downgrading their full-year forecasts earlier this year. When, during the bid, Dowty reported full-year profits of Pounds 29m, some 40 per cent above expectations, the City was reluctant to accept the figures or the company's claims about recovery. With the bid coming only two months into its financial year, Dowty has also effectively been prevented from issuing a profits forecast for this year, a weapon which target companies consider one of their most effective defences. Almost certainly Dowty will enjoy a substantial profits recovery this year, not only because of higher anticipated orders for aircraft and spares. In the year since Mr Ralph took over, Dowty has slashed costs, reducing the workforce in the aerospace division by 27 per cent and cutting the wage bill by an estimated Pounds 50m. Some of this will benefit Dowty this year. But the company, its advisers Lazards, and its brokers Cazenove, have not felt they can forecast the strength of the recovery this early in the year. In the last week, Dowty was forced by the takeover panel to distance itself from whispers that it would make pre-tax profits of Pounds 50m this year, significantly higher than market expectations. Had Dowty been sufficiently confident to make such a forecast, TI's 188.3p share offer and 175p cash alternative would have started to look less than generous. As it is, Dowty's shares yesterday closed at 176p, down 4p. Price is not however the deciding factor in this bid. Dowty will maintain or lose its independence over the question of management. Here Dowty not only has problems with its own record. Mr Ralph is also trying to repel an increasingly well-respected management team. Mr Lewinton may raise eyebrows in some corners of the City with his chunky executive compensation packages or some of his accounting practices, but shareholders do not argue with the way he has turned TI around. In the six years since taking over at what used to be called Tube Investments, Mr Lewinton has transformed the bicycles and kettles company into an international sales and pipes business and has, until last year, consistently grown earnings per share. Dowty by comparison, clearly has not given its shareholders earnings growth. While recession in aerospace has been partly to blame, the fatal blow may well prove to have been the ill-timed expansion of its Information Technology division under Mr Tony Thatcher, the previous chief executive. Mr Ralph has recognised the mistake and Information Technology is up for sale - either by an independent Dowty or a victorious TI. But try as he may, Mr Ralph has failed to distance himself entirely from responsibility for Dowty's expensive detour from engineering. As a result Dowty has consistently found that a lack of management credibility over the longer-term future has been a difficult obstacle to overcome. While institutions appear to like Mr Lewinton's record, they have not been as impressed in terms of aerospace industry logic by the prospect of a TI/Dowty marriage. At best, analysts agree, Dowty's landing gear, propeller and avionics division and its polymer engineering division would complement TI's aerospace engineering and John Crane sales businesses. From TI's point of view, however, the acquisition of Dowty makes strikingly good sense. It would add a third business leg to Bundy International pipes and John Crane, each with sales of about Pounds 400m. And it would give TI critical mass internationally in the two areas, thereby reducing exposure to cyclical markets. These markets are likely to recover this year but not perhaps enough to reverse last year's decline in earnings growth. Dowty, as one might expect, claims that TI actually needs another acquisition to resume earnings growth as there is evidence of only a meagre historic contribution from organic growth. Mr Lewinton rejects this argument but admits the engineering industry will remain difficult. 'It is going to be a long, steady, grinding climb,' he says. What Dowty's shareholders appear to have decided is that they would like Mr Lewinton and not Mr Ralph to lead that climb.</p>

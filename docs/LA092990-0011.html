			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> BANK ROBBERY SUSPECT CAPTURED  </P> <P> A masked man brandishing a 20-gauge shotgun took over an Oxnard bank Friday  morning, robbing three tellers and then leading police on a 20-minute car chase  through residential areas, authorities said.  </P> <P> Oxnard police arrested Tony Ray, 33, of Oxnard on suspicion of armed robbery,  said Gary Auer of the FBI's Ventura bureau.  </P> <P>  If convicted, Ray could face up to 20 years in prison and a $10,000 fine.  </P> <P> At about 10 a.m., a gunman entered Security Pacific Bank, 606 N. Ventura Road,  wearing what looked like a rubber Ronald Reagan mask. He went behind the  tellers' row and deposited money into a duffel bag, Sgt. Denny Phillips of the  Oxnard Police Department said.  </P> <P> When a customer, one of about 17 people in the bank, questioned the  authenticity of his gun, the man ejected a cartridge on the floor, Phillips  said.  </P> <P> The gunman also hit a customer with the gun, Auer added, although no one was  seriously injured.  </P> <P> After someone outside the bank called the police, five patrol cars arrived in  time to watch the robber jump into a car. The police chased the car through  residential areas at speeds of more than 80 m.p.h. for about 20 minutes until a  rear tire blew out while the car rounded a curve in the 2100 block of Lantana  Street, Phillips said.  </P> <P> Two police cars were damaged in the pursuit when one ran into the other while  making an abrupt turn, Phillips said.  </P> <P> After the robbery, the bank closed for the remainder of the day, Phillips said.

			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Finance and the Family: The Week Ahead - Glued to Granada / The Budget and You Whatever the circumstances, the full-year results of Granada Group, the leisure, television and computer services concern, are bound to be interesting on Wednesday. Of course the City is keen to find out whether Gerry Robinson, the chief executive who produced a 129 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 130m last time can once again work a little magic. There is also the question of how well the Pounds 360m acquisition of Sutcliffe, the contract caterer, is doing under the leadership of a man who came from Compass, the catering group. Analysts are saying Granada and Robinson performed perfectly decently in the year to September and are looking for pre-tax figures, including the contribution from Sutcliffe, of around Pounds 165m. On this occasion, however all minds will be concentrating not on the dividend or the prospective p/e, but on when Granada is going down the takeover trail blazed by Carlton Communications last week in its agreed bid for Central. With high operational gearing in its glass-making business, forecasting profits from Pilkington is difficult and there is a wide range of estimates for pre-tax profits for the six months to end September to be reported on Thursday. Compared to Pounds 15.1m last year, forecasts are from a small increase to a doubling of profits. It is a question of how much better profits in the UK and US will be offset by continuing declines in Europe. Pilkington is expected to rebalance its dividend having cut two finals without a reduction in the interim, but the assumption is that the total for the year will be unchanged. Airtours, the holiday group, announces full-year results on Monday, with pre-tax profits expected to be about Pounds 45m, compared with last year's Pounds 36.5m. This year's figure is after Pounds 9m spent on the failed attempt earlier this year to take over rival Owners Abroad. Interest will focus on booking levels for this winter and next summer and the effect, if any, of the new airport departure tax. The group will also be questioned on progress on integrating newly-acquired travel chains, Pickfords and Hogg Robinso.</p>

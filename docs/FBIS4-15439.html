			<p>BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Apr 07, BNS -- Russia's intentions to  create military bases in Latvia and countries of the CIS "can  hurt the fragile agreement between Russia and Latvia on the  Skrunda radar base," Justas Paleckis, foreign policy adviser to  the Lithuanian president, said Thursday [7 April].    Russian President Boris Yeltsin signed a decree April 5  suggesting Foreign and Defense ministries to create bases in  Latvia and the CIS for testing new weapons systems.    Paleckis said he hasn't seen the official text of the decree  yet, but if media reports are precise enough, the Russian  leader's decision can create tension in Baltic-Russian relations.    The presidential adviser said the decree contradicts  Brazauskas' view that the Baltic coast should be free of arms in  the future. Paleckis said the idea was mentioned in the  Lithuanian president's speech at the United Nations last year.    Paleckis said military bases in foreign countries is an  international practice, "but everything depends on historic  circumstances and agreement between states, while the historic  circumstances for Russia's military return to the Baltic states  are unfavorable in this case."</p>

			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: UK banks Since banks are supposed to be interest rate-sensitive stocks, they might have been expected to forge ahead after Friday's base rate cut. Instead, Barclays has fallen by 11 per cent amid renewed worries about its dividend, Lloyds is scarcely changed, National Westminster is down 1 per cent and even the highly-regarded Bank of Scotland is down 4 per cent. The market evidently believes interest rates are still far too high to stop asset prices falling. It follows that the quality of bank loan books continues to deteriorate. In this context the latest survey of UK bank lending from Robert Fleming and Dun &amp; Bradstreet is hardly encouraging. High-risk corporate loans rose by Pounds 700m to Pounds 31.8bn in the first half of 1992. Banks would need Pounds 4.2bn in additional provisions to cover 30 per cent of that total. The main burden would fall on Barclays, National Westminster, Bank of Scotland and Royal Bank (whose shares have risen 3 per cent since the rate cut). Small wonder, then, that investors are snapping up banks with high foreign currency earnings such as HSBC and Standard Chartered. But both depend heavily on the volatile Hong Kong market. The latter's profits may be boosted by currency movements but these also weaken its tightish capital ratio. As for a traditionally defensive stock like Abbey National, it cannot remain unscathed indefinitely if house prices continue to fall.</p>

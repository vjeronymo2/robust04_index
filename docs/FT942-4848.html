			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / IMF considers loans as a defence against speculation The International Monetary Fund is considering the possibility of setting up a new loan facility to provide money in a hurry for countries whose currencies come under short term speculative attack. Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF's managing director, said yesterday that a short term facility of this sort 'would help cushion the reserves of countries suddenly subjected to bursts of speculation in spite of policies that Fund surveillance has found to be appropriate.' Such a facility would help member countries implementing sound policies to avoid being pushed off track by wayward and temporary losses of confidence among international investors,' Mr Camdessus told the Institute for International Economics, a Washington economic policy think tank, at a lunch meeting yesterday. As more countries have removed curbs on capital movements, and as the international capital markets have become more global, more and more countries, including newly industrialised nations in Asia and Latin America, have become vulnerable to sudden currency flows. In a speech which was his first major discussion of the IMF's role in its fiftieth anniversary year, Mr Camdessus insisted that the Fund remained very much a monetary institution, even if most of its loans now went to developing nations and the former centrally-planned economies. 'We continue to address monetary problems, balance of payments problems, with monetary resources,' Mr Camdessus said. 'It is not because you add a subsidy so as not to overburden countries which are already burdened that you become an aid agency.' Part of the appeal of a short-term facility to combat currency fluctuations, however, would be that it would be available to industrialised countries which have scarcely called on the IMF's resources in the last twenty years, even though the largest industrialised countries would be unlikely to need it. Discussion of the facility is, however, very preliminary. Its architecture poses considerable problems: how do you attach the IMF's traditional economic policy conditions to a facility which by definition must provide money instantly to face sudden speculative movements?</p>

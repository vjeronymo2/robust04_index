It therefore seemed expedient to prepare and study the  spectral-luminescent and photochemical properties of complexes  of rare earth elements with polymers. Only a few works on this  problem have been published. In the present work a study was  made of spectral-luminescent and photochemical properties of  Eu(III) complexes with copolymers of acrylic acid and esters of  methacrylic acid. The photochemical behavior of the  macromolecular complexes was observed to be markedly different  from the properties of the low molecular analogs, e.g. during  photo-decomposition the luminescent intensity of  Eu[.sup]3+[/] does not diminish, but rather increases  noticeably. The effectiveness of Eu[.sup]3+[/] luminescent  glow is a function of the composition and structure of the  initial macromolecular complex. A low metal concentration, low  acrylic acid content, and an increase in the length of the alkyl  radical on the methacrylate facilitate intensification of the  effectiveness of luminescent glow of the rare earth ion.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On the closely related matter of deductions from wages, in the Proposed Rule the Department set out a multi-part test, and requested public comment as to the appropriateness of that or some other standard and as to whether the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant's international travel expenses to initially come and finally return from employment should be considered a business expense not susceptible to recoupment by the employer through wage deductions. Ten commenters responded on the deductions issue. Seven of the 10 opposed the proposed test, for a variety of reasons. On the transportation expense sub-issue, five commenters asserted that the costs should be considered a business expense, and two commenters took the opposite position (with one arguing that the Department lacked statutory authority to impose such costs on an employer). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on a careful review of these comments and the information which the Department has obtained through the administration and enforcement of the program, the Department has concluded that a flexible, three-part test on allowable deductions will be promulgated, so as to be less burdensome for employers but fair and protective for workers. Under this test, three categories of deductions are authorized: those required by law; those that are reasonable and customary in the occupation and area of intended employment; and those that are voluntary on the part of the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant. While each of these categories has regulatory restrictions, the test, taken as a whole, affords significant latitude for employers and H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants to achieve any bona fide arrangement to facilitate the employment situation. The flexible test does  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> not <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  permit the employer situation. The flexible test does  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> not <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  permit the employer to impose the burden of business expense(s) on the worker. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based upon the comments and the Department's reading of the statute, for purposes of this regulation, the Department has determined that for this final rule, international travel costs to the job initially and from the job at the conclusion of employment will not be considered to be employer's business expense. Section 212(n) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1182(n)), which contains the LCA requirements, is silent regarding international travel. In &sect;214(c)(5)(A) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1184(c)(5)(A)), however, Congress specifically addressed international travel by providing that ``in the case of an [H&hyph;1B] alien&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;who is dismissed from employment by the employer before the end of the period of authorized admission, the employer shall be liable for the reasonable costs of return transportation of the alien abroad.'' The Department has concluded that by making the employer liable for international travel costs under specific circumstances, and not addressing any other circumstances, Congress intended that the employer be liable for international travel costs only under the specified circumstances. Of course, this does not preclude an employer from paying the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant's international travel expenses. Further, if the employer and employee enter into a bona fide,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> voluntary <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  agreement whereby the employer advances monies to cover the employee's cost of international travel subject to recoupment through wage deductions, such deductions would be allowable provided that the deductions do not exceed the amount of money advanced by the employer_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , not subject to interest or any other form of surcharge. Such deductions must comply with all other applicable Federal/State laws. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> c. Prevailing Wage 5% Provision  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (See &sect; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .731(d)(4).) In the Preamble to the Proposed Rule, the Department described its program experience and its concern regarding apparent confusion as to the Interim Final's provision dealing with what has been called a 5% variable on the payment of the prevailing wage. The provision in question was incorporated into the H&hyph;1B regulation from the permanent program regulations at 20 CFR 656.40(a)(2)(i). As explained in the Preamble and set out in the proposed regulatory language, it is and has been the Department's position, in the H&hyph;1B program, that although an employer will not be considered to be in violation if found to have paid 95% or more of the prevailing wage, the employer found to have paid less than 95% will not only be cited for violation but also be assessed back wages based on 100% of the prevailing wage. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Seven commenters expressed views regarding the proposed clarification of the regulation. A labor organization expressed opposition to the Department's toleration of any variable, and suggested that an employer found to have paid less than 100% should be required ``to pay in full once the error is detected.'' A law firm, stating the concerns of employers, advocated that no change should be made in this provision. Two government officials (one State, one Federal) favored the continued application of a 5% variable, although one of these commenters (Federal official) suggested that no variable should be allowed for users of published wage surveys that are statistically valid. Two business commenters (computer software corporations) recognized the proposal as a clarification of the Department's position, and one described the new provision as ``very helpful.'' A member of the general public described the proposed regulatory language as ``a fair compromise.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> Provisions Proposed But Not Adopted <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> a. Prevailing wage update. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A number of commenters to the proposed rule published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on August 5, 1991, and the Interim Final Rule published October 22, 1991, and January 13, 1992, respectively, objected to the requirement that an employer must obtain prevailing wage information at any time other than when the application is first filed. These commenters pointed to &sect;212(n)(1)(A)(i) of the INA (as amended by MTINA) which states that the employer is offering wages that are at least ``*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;the prevailing wage level&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;based on the best information available as of the time of filing the application&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;.'' The Department indicated that it recognized that the language could be construed to mean that the prevailing wage should be determined only once, at the time of filing the application. Further, the Department seriously considered requiring that the employer determine the prevailing wage only at the time of filing the application, but concluded that in the case of an application with a 6-year validity period, such procedure would render the prevailing wage requirement virtually meaningless. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department also considered, alternatively, requiring that the validity period of the labor condition application be shortened to 1 or 2 years, with an attendant prevailing wage determination every time the application was filed. The Department decided, in the October 22, 1991, Interim Final Rule, that this approach would be unnecessarily burdensome and opted instead for what it considered a less burdensome and more sensible approach,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , one application for up to six years but with a prevailing wage determination every two years starting from the date the labor condition application is certified. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

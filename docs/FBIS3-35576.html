			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Georgiy Shemelev] </F>   [Text] Moscow January 31 TASS -- Russia has left behind the  vestiges of the Soviet Union's policy, which included also the  so-called "full normalisation of Russian-Chinese relations", as  well as "the stage of ideological love and hate" between the two  countries, according to Andrey Kozyrev.    Russia and China have established new relations  characterised  by normal cooperation without any "special adjustment" between  the partners. The Russian foreign minister said this responding  to an ITAR-TASS question on board the airplane which brought him  back to Moscow from an official visit to China.    "Our relations now contain elements of geostrategical mutual  understanding," Kozyrev said. "We are not working against any  third country, or the West, for example. We do not have any  anti-Western overtones in our cooperation, but no more do we  look back at the West or depend on the West," Kozyrev said. "The  two great powers feel the need for interaction relating to an  extensive range of questions both on the regional and global  scales".    These circumstances enabled Russia to raise the question  about constructive partnership with China, and the response of  the Chinese leadership to this idea was "very balanced, and  positive in principle", Kozyrev said. He expressed confidence  that this idea "in one form or another, enriched and mutually  filled with specific substance" can be implemented ahead of  Chinese leader Jiang Zemin's forthcoming visit to Moscow this  year.    Speaking about his impressions from visiting the  free-enterprise zone in Shenzhen, Kozyrev called it "very  useful" and stressed that reforms in the zone were an example of  economic development "Chinese style". It can be seen as part of  "great Chinese experience of reforming its economy in a more  modern direction". It is obvious that China is "looking for  ways of entering the modern world, a world of high technologies  and living standards".    But the main thing is for us is to entertain no illusions  about the possibility of copying this experience. We tend to  idiologise and idealise now Western, now Chinese experience, or  vice-versa, Kozyrev said. My visit to Shenzhen showed that  neither exists "per se", although there are specific conditions  in both places. One can say that Shenzhen is one of the  regional versions of the development of Chinese reforms and the  conclusions to be drawn from this is that Russia should look for  its own versions of economic development applicable in the  specific conditions of its own regions.    The minister explained what he meant when referring to China  as a country "near abroad". "There are now and can be no  countries of the first rank and the second rank. When we speak  about the development of ties with one or another country "near  abroad" we mean that it is one of the closest neighbouring  states and we must have goodneighbourly relations with it. One  of the high priorities in the Russian foreign policy has always  been the creation of a belt of goodneighbourliness and  cooperation, Kozyrev recalled. "I am seeking to affirm the most  direct, and if you will sound sense of the words "West, East,  near abroad. The countries "near abroad" are those which are  closest to us and with which we need to develop relations as we  do with any other state without forgetting that they are our  neighbours," Kozyrev said.    As concerns prospects for the democratic movement in Russia,  Andrey Kozyrev said he did not see Yegor Gaydar's resignation as  a necessity, and had strong doubts on this score. "I respect  personal motives, including Gaydar's political ones. Everyone  may make some long-term tactical and strategic moves, but from  the point of view of the post-election correlation of forces in  Russia and prospects for the democratic movement I think he  should have tried and worked in the government for some more  time and thus affirm his own viewpoint," Kozyrev said.  According to him, Gaydar should not have "weakened his  democratic potential in the public eyes, especially after the  relative defeat in the elections. According to the minister,  resignations cannot help strengthen the democratic movement.    Kozyrev stressed that he had sought to help resolve the  problem by meeting President Yeltsin, Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin and Yegor Gaydar last Monday on his own initiative  as a mediator. He found it strange that Gaydar left the reform  team which is effectively headed by Yeltsin. Differences have  occurred among other ministers on the presidential team, and it  is not always difficult to hold one's own but the president is a  uniting force and a guarantor of the reformist character of all  changes, he said. Kozyrev pointed out that temporary setbacks  were possible, but on the whole it was possible to achieve  corrections and stand one's ground. He said it was not  advisable to transfer acute questions to the sphere of public  and political polemics, but resolve them within the team  instead, just as it was and is being done all the time.    Nonetheless, what has been done has been done, and it might  somehow stimulate the democrats to re-align forces and draw  "very serious conclusions" collectively. It is easier to resign  from the government than to make it clear to oneself and society  what had really happened in the elections and how we are going  to carry on reforms in a democratic and not an authoritarian  way. "The version of reforms which relied on, and even exploited  the president's popularity and mandate is exhausted," he said.  Reformers, who are also democrats, claim, as they do here now,  a political role for himself and politicize their activity. But  for this they must get a popular mandate in the elections on  their own. The past elections did not give them a mandate which  could justify their claim to domination in the government. This  means they have to learn their lessons and think about the  following elections. "I hope the present situation will prompt  not only dramatic resignations but also substantial  self-analysis," Kozyrev said.</p>

			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Switch off, in silence: Kieran Cooke recharges his spiritual batteries during a retreat at a Benedictine monestary in Ireland THE CHANTING of the monks washed through the church, a mesmerising, hypnotic melody, waves of sound falling, lapping, withdrawing and returning. My feet, at 6.30am, were blocks of ice. Thermal underwear could not keep out the chill. The abbot said the final prayer. The novice collected stray missals and extinguished the candles. In silence we all withdrew. Some go to Indian ashrams. Some lock themselves in Highland cottages. Some visit Outward Bound schools. Others, more simply satisfied, light the fire, uncork the claret, puff a Cuban, put the feet up - and stare into space. It is called switching off, a time to let the mind wander, a time to reflect  -what a philosopher friend describes as 'Having a good look at your fundamentals'. Glenstal Abbey is a Benedictine monastery in the depths of County Tipperary in Ireland. 'Yes,' said Brother Michael on the phone, 'We do take in guests. Of course we would be happy to have you.' Going up the long driveway I panicked and almost turned back. It was like popping in to Balmoral for Christmas dinner. How was one supposed to act? What could one talk about? I had booked in for two days. How would I fill the time? Brother Michael, the guest master, put me at ease. 'Now there's your room, there's tea downstairs and vespers is at 6.20pm.' He saw my nervousness. 'Don't worry,' he said with a big wink, 'we'll have you drummed in in no time.' The Benedictines take their name from their founder, St Benedict, born in Italy at the end of the 5th century. It is not a strict or enclosed monastic order: life is built around the rule of St Benedict, which emphasises the community life, daily work, the daily round of common prayer and hospitality. 'All guests who present themselves are to be welcomed as Christ,' says the rule of Benedict. There is no charge for staying at a Benedictine monastery. Guests are merely expected to make some contribution, according to their means. Fr Bernard, a remarkably agile 82-year-old with a ready line in wit and wisdom, shepherds me into church. 'We allow our guests to sit with the monks but you needn't bother yourself. We're relatively harmless.' A nun is the only other visitor. We sit in the monastic misericordia by the altar. I am shown how to follow the psalms, in English, and the rest of the service, in Latin. To sit among monks while the liturgical office is chanted back and forth is rather like suddenly finding yourself given a seat in the New York Philharmonic. Or being handed a paint brush by Leonardo da Vinci and asked to do a spot of touching up on the Sistine chapel while he nips out for a plate of pasta. It is a great privilege. It is embracing. But it is also at first slightly nerve-wracking; you wonder when to bow or bob, where to look. After vespers there is what is described as a period of silence, then supper. Fr Bernard ushers the nun and me into the monks' dining room. The meal, we are told, takes place in silence. At first this seems very strange. How do you ask for another slice of bread? How do you get hold of the sugar at the other end of the long table. The monks on each side are extremely attentive. 'The first time I had a meal with them I had a fit of giggles,' said the nun. 'But you quickly get used to it.' The food is wholesome: chicken stew and brown rice with as much bread and jam as you want. Tea is drunk from large bowls. Two monks rush about serving: with delicate hand gestures they ask if you have finished. No talking means that the meal passes within minutes. Then you sit back and listen to the monk who is doing the reading. He starts with some scripture but then continues with a book about recent events in Moscow. Monks, one realises, are very worldly-wise. Some laugh or nod sagely as the reading goes on. Life in a monastery is ruled by the tolling of the bell. At 8.40pm it rings for compline. By 9.30pm you are in your 'cell,' reading or writing or praying - or preparing yourself for a 6am start. At breakfast, which the guests take separately, Fr Bernard explains the steps to becoming a monk. First, you enter as a postulant for a year. Then you take simple vows for a minimum of three years during which time you cannot leave without a dispensation from the order. 'When you're a novice it's a trial run if you like. At the end of your simple vows you are as free as a lark to go. If you decide to stay then you take your final vows for life.' Glenstal has a community of 40 monks, from all manner of backgrounds and together possessed of a bewildering array of qualifications and talents. There are seven PhD's landscape gardener who has exhibited at the Chelsea flower show and is also a scholar of Russian icons. A number are talented musicians. One is an expert on Byzantine liturgy. Another produces historical text books for schools and specialises in modern Russia. Fr Paddy is monastery bursar, in charge of finances. A theologian who was a parish priest for years before entering the monastery, he organises an annual ecumenical conference at Glenstal, tends the monastery's 17th century walled garden and is a member of the core group of monks who lead the chanting of the liturgy. Fr Paddy is concerned about what work the monks should and should not be doing in order to support the monastery. 'There is an ongoing debate here and at other monasteries about how monks should support themselves. We can no longer remain entirely dependent on the traditional ways.' The Glenstal community has a school of 200 pupils and a farm. At present both are profitable: there is a 12-year waiting list for the school, which benefits from a large measure of state aid. Glenstal has also managed to continue to attract one or two novices each year. The situation is radically different at many other Benedictine monasteries and other religious orders in England and elsewhere. In those, there is a serious shortage of novices and a battle to remain self sufficient with an increasingly ageing community. The monastery schools are short of pupils while costs are rising. If alternative forms of income are not found, some communities could be forced to close. 'We are fortunate at the moment but we realise that we, too, must look at other ways of surviving,' says Fr Paddy. 'We could perhaps make a liqueur, as some of the older monasteries have done. But then there is the opinion that we should be producing goods for which there is a need and not simply producing something to suit the jaded palates of the rich.' Some suggest that monks should do more secular activities, even take jobs outside the monastery. But this would threaten the stability of the community and inevitably mean that the monks could not abide by one of their main tenets - the saying together of the daily round of prayer. Many monks object to the thought of working outside. After all, they joined to be part of a community and not to spend the majority of their time in the secular world. The bell for midday mass interrupts discussions. The Abbot, Fr Celestine, co-celebrates with the community. Again there is that feeling of taking part in a timeless ritual, following the liturgy in the way monks have done for centuries. After a buffet-style lunch, this time with talking allowed, Fr Paddy and I take a walk in Glenstal's rolling grounds. Glenstal was built for an Anglo-Irish merchant family in the middle of the last century. A gangling, impressive folly, the house and grounds were laid out in the style of a 12th century castle. 'We are discussing various ways of ensuring our survival as a community,' says Fr Paddy. 'There are those who feel that the modern equivalent of monks working on illuminated manuscripts is designing on a computer. I think that in the modern world there is a great need for adult counselling or the more broadly-based education we can offer here. We have the teaching expertise and the perfect environment.' With the rain sweeping through the mock turrets and battlements, it is already time to leave. We stroll through the monks' graveyard, neat, unadorned tomb stones laid out like a soldier's cemetery. Before going, a look at the visitor's book. It is full of praise for the monks for providing such a haven in a busy world. One visitor was obviously greatly uplifted by it all, but found the Tipperary weather difficult: 'I found spiritual peace - next time I'll bring my wellingtons.' Perhaps the priest from Northern Ireland summed things up best of all. 'Every wise virgin needs a regular oil change. Thanks for a great retreat.'</p>

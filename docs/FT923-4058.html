			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Fisons' doubtful cure After yesterday's interim results, the market lost all patience with Fisons. The proximate cause of the 14 per cent share price fall was a further reduction in analysts' estimates of full year profits, but behind that are worries that the new team also suffers from a habit of producing nasty surprises. Historically, shocks have centred on the pharmaceuticals division and its spat with the US Food and Drug Administration. Now it transpires that the scientific instruments business has been badly hit by recession and the company has not hedged for 1993 against the effects of a weaker dollar. Although some of this can be put down to bad luck, such developments will hardly help management shed its reputation for treading on banana skins. Fisons has some good products and there is a market for them. The balance sheet will be further strengthened this year by disposals which should eliminate net borrowings. But credibility is the key to the company's revival. To prosper as a small player in pharmaceuticals, and to find favour in the City, the company must be seen to have mastered its difficulties - most notably the production problems which have slowed sales and soured relations with the US authorities. Of course there are props for the share price. The dividend looks secure, and the yield of 1.5 times the market average is more commonly found among recovery stocks than drug companies. The businesses have real value - broken up the company is worth more than its present Pounds 1bn market capitalisation. But with no bidder in sight, investors must decide when or whether that value will be realised by the current management. The judgment is still finely balanced.</p>

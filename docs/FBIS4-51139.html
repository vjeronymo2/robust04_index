			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter: "60 Percent of State-Owned Enterprises </F> in Harbin City Suffer Losses; Authorities Plan To Change Most of  Them To Nongovernmental Enterprises"]    [Text] Harbin, an important city in north China, has for  years seen poor returns among state-owned enterprises, and of  these, the number of loss-making ones is on the rise. The city  has recently made a decisive decision, that is, except for a  small number of backbone enterprises engaging in posts,  telecommunications, railways, and roads, the city's 5,000 or so  state-owned enterprises will be changed into nongovernmental  enterprises by 1995 at the latest.    Harbin is the provincial capital of Heilongjiang, and the  city's economic situation can be regarded as the epitome of the  whole province. Sun Weiben, the provincial party secretary, and  Shao Qihui, the provincial governor, are suspected of  inefficient leadership and the inability to change the  persistent situation of loss-making state-run enterprises, so  they were stripped of their "official posts" by Vice Premier Zhu  Rongji during his recent inspection tour of the three northeast  provinces. The posts of provincial party secretary and  provincial governor have been taken by Yue Qifeng and Tian  Fengshan respectively.    Harbin Vice Mayor Zhu Shengchu told reporters at a public  occasion in Hong Kong yesterday that the number of loss-making  state-owned enterprises in the city had reached a situation  where "major surgery" was unavoidable. He said that in 1991,  according to an estimate, over 40 percent of the 5,000  state-owned enterprises in the city were losing money, and since  last year the figure had risen to 60 percent, while many  enterprises have ceased production or are operating at half  capacity.    Zhu said that the city's plan to change state-owned  enterprises to nongovernmental enterprises had won approval from  the central authorities, and this was a pioneer move in  contemporary China. At present, Harbin has 1.5 million people  working in state-owned enterprises and units, and Zhu said that  an absolute majority of cadres and workers "welcomed" the  above-mentioned reform.    Zhu said that Harbin had decided to change more than 5,000  state-owned enterprises in the city--except for a small number  of backbone state enterprises engaged in posts,  telecommunications, railways, roads, and communications--into  nongovernmental enterprises no later than next year. Methods to  be adopted will include the joint-stock system, auctions, and  leasing to workers or persons in society.    This year, Harbin will first begin work to change  state-owned  enterprises in the four counties of Hulan, Acheng, Fangzheng,  and Yilan to nongovernmental enterprises. Early this year,  Binxian County took the lead in selling and leasing all 168  state-owned enterprises to society. Some enterprises went to  their workers, who bought shares. At present, all of the  factories are able to pay wages, and economic returns have  greatly improved.</p>

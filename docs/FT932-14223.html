			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / The Lex Column: No ace in the hole The Channel Tunnel project, which began in a euphoric wave of entente cordiale, looks set to end in a deluge of disputation. Eurotunnel is now pursuing claims against a rolling stock manufacturer, British Rail and SNCF as well as both nations' governments. After yesterday's bitter exchanges, the dispute with the TML consortium looks even further from resolution. Who will emerge as the 'winner' is debatable given that both sides have already lost. The contractors can ill-afford the cash to complete the project's commissioning. They have already been forced to take substantial provisions. But Eurotunnel is scarcely profiting from TML's discomfiture. Absurdly, the delay in opening could cost Eurotunnel more in lost revenues than the sums in dispute with TML. In a more rational world, Eurotunnel's bankers might be expected to bash heads together. The good news is the spectacular project will open some time next year. Eurotunnel's shares have risen strongly in anticipation. But the company's financial vice will not immediately ease on opening. Its revenue projections for 1994 have fallen drastically from Pounds 504m to Pounds 260m. Its peak funding requirement may climb to little shy of Pounds 10bn. Even with a further injection of Pounds 850m of debt and equity finance, Eurotunnel will not reach a cash break-even position until 1997. There remain massive variables in Eurotunnel's funding, revenues and interest charges, which suggests the shares should be shunned. Emotion rather than reason will, however, probably continue to drive the share price.</p>

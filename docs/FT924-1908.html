			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Survey of The Baltic Basin States (9): New openings to the north - After 300 years, Poland looks to Scandinavia again IT HAS been more than 300 years since Poles were last forced to look hard at their neighbours on the north shore of the Baltic. That was when the Swedes, led by King Gustavus Adolphus, invaded and took control of most of Poland in the 1650s. In between times, Poles became accustomed to focusing on their neighbours to the east and the west as potential threats to their country's independence. This neglect of the north is now changing - very slowly. Mr Andrzej Arendarski, Poland's foreign trade minister, recently appealed to Swedish businessmen for 'a new invasion, not with arms this time but with capital investments.' Time will show if his appeal will be taken up. The three years since the fall of communism have failed to produce an explosion of either trade or inward investment from across the Baltic. Several hundred small and medium size businesses from Scandinavia have located production operations in northern Poland, but the capital involved is seldom more than a few hundred thousand dollars. Sweden is the main partner, with about 400 Swedish owned or Swedish-Polish joint ventures, as well as some 150 Danish joint ventures and 45 from Finland. The best known Finnish partner is the Neste oil corporation. But Scania, the Swedish truck and van maker, recently opted to assemble its vehicles at Kapena, a Polish enterprise in Koszalin, close to Gdansk, and Volvo is also planning to assemble buses at the Jelcz plant, this time in southern Poland. Scandinavian investors have not only come up against the usual bureaucratic barriers, but also against the fact that Poland's attention is still focused on the European Community and increased access to EC markets. It is Germany, Poland's neighbour to the west, which has become the country's prime trading partner. Both Italy and Holland do more business with the Poles than the Scandinavians. The absence of a strong lobby in Poland for tighter links with the Baltic region is the more surprising because contemporary Poland has hundreds of miles of Baltic coast line stretching from Swinoujscie and Szczecin in the west to Elblag near Kaliningrad in the east. The Baltic also provides a living for both private and state owned fishing fleets - but rising costs of fuel and low catches have played havoc with the sector in the past three years. The closed sea has been turned into a significant ecological problem largely because Poland, which has almost 40m inhabitants, became a serious source of pollution under careless communism. Air and water pollution emanating from Poland has wreaked havoc on Scandinavian air quality and is an important factor behind the acid rain which is affecting lakes and forests. Part of Poland's foreign debt has been reduced on the understanding that Warsaw will change industrial practices which endanger the life and health of people on both sides of the Baltic. In future, planned motorway and rail communications will make Poland an increasingly important transit route for Scandinavian trade. Freight and passenger sea links between Poland's Baltic ports of Gdansk, Gdynia and Szczecin and southern Sweden as well as Denmark and Finland are already in place and can easily be expanded. There is also scope for co-operation in shipbuilding, where Denmark's Burmeister and Wain already maintains strong ties with Polish yards such as the Paris Commune works in Gdynia. But overall trade is still relatively small. Poland's two-way trade with Sweden last year was worth Dollars 612m, followed by Dollars 622m with Denmark and Dollars 512m with Finland. Increased trade with Sweden is expected after Poland signs an agreement with the Efta countries similar to Poland's association treaty with Brussels. The treaty with Efta also foresees a gradual reduction of tariff and other trade barriers leading to their elimination in the industrial goods sector by the end of the century. The agreement has been initialled, but some snags remain, particularly over bilateral trade in agricultural products with Finland, which has had a free trade arrangement with Poland since 1976. This has given the Finns a competitive edge which they are loath to lose. The Finns would also gain from plans to build the Via Baltica, a highway to link Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania with Poland and points further west and south. Studies are also almost complete on the cost of restoring a German built highway linking what is now the desolate military enclave of Kaliningrad with Elblag to the south. These road connections would eventually tie the eastern baltic countries through Poland with the planned north/south European highway - and help reintegrate an area whose natural links were cut. Away to the west, the Poles are hoping to cooperate with Swedes and with the Danish island of Bornholm to form a 'Euroregion' between the Szczecin region of Poland and Germany's north eastern territories, to forge links in border areas. The Germans wanted a bilateral arrangement, but the Poles suggested that Danes and Swedes come in as a counterweight. Looking further ahead, the Poles may find that despite any strong tradition of close ties with the north they, like the three post communist Baltic states, are interested in drawing Scandinavian countries towards them to modify not only a continuing Russian influence, but united Germany's economic might as well.</p>

			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: DEL MAR  </P> <P> A 20-year-old man who killed his best friend was sentenced Wednesday to six  years in the custody of the California Youth Authority.  </P> <P> Simon James Oakes was 19 when he fatally shot Daniel Fripp, 22, on March 6 in  Oakes' parents' home. Oaks pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter.  </P> <P> San Diego Superior Court Judge Bernard Revak said Oakes' sentencing was very  difficult to decide. The judge could have sentenced him to 11 years in state  prison or put him on probation.  </P> <P> Witnesses called by the defense said Fripp was not welcome in the Oakes home  and had used methamphetamine with James Oakes before.  </P> <P> The judge said that he does not believe Oakes is a danger to society and that  the shooting was an isolated event.  </P> <P> Revak allowed Oakes to remain free until Monday because Oakes has a college  exam to take Friday.  </P></p>

			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Energy boost planned for Australia's Kalgoorlie mines IN ABOUT two years time a 2,000 km (1,250 mile) pipeline costing between ADollars 300m and ADollars 500m (Pounds 147m-Pounds 245m) could be carrying natural gas from Dampier in the north of Western Australia to the Kalgoorlie gold fields area, providing cheap energy to boost natural resources development there, according to Mr Colin Barnett, the state's new minister for resources development and energy. Western Mining Corporation, the biggest energy user in the area, would almost certainly be involved, either as a member of a consortium that would build and operate the pipeline or as a customer. Mr Barnett said yesterday that the pipeline would bring inexpensive energy to an area where supplies were not consistent and many companies used diesel fuel to provide their own power. The pipeline project was of a type that should be sponsored by the new Coalition state government, which was committed to building the state economy on its natural resources. He claimed that the change of government had sparked new optimism among resource companies. Since the election two weeks ago Western Mining had announced that it would proceed with the ADollars 450m Mt Keith nickel project in the state and Woodside Petroleum had given the go-ahead for the ADollars 1.1bn Cossack Wanea offshore oil and gas venture. He said the government would change the state law to permit seven-days-a-week working in the Kambalada area, near Kalgoorlie. Western Mining was ready to proceed with an ADollars 105m expansion and upgrading scheme at its Kambalada nickel operations once that change had been made. The trade unions were 'reasonably satisfied' with this proposed change in the law, which was at the centre of a long running argument between Western Mining and the previous Labor government. 'We will not let minority interests hold the rest of the community to ransom,' Mr Barnett said. Western Mining also previously said the cost of rail transport was holding back development at Kambalada. Mr Barnett said the state-owned railways would become more competitive and that the cost of transport would not be permitted to prevent projects going forward. His government was committed to reducing the cost of energy by 40 per cent in real terms by 2000 by splitting up the state energy monopoly and encouraging private sector investment. Barnett admitted that he expected some opposition to the pipeline project, but the route would avoid national parks, environmentally sensitive areas and areas know to be of special significance to aboriginal people. He hoped permitting procedures would be completed by the middle of 1994 and then the pipeline would take 18 to 24 months to build. Local analysts suggested that one project likely to benefit from the pipeline was the Bulong nickel-cobalt venture between Western Mining and Resolute Resources and its associate Energy Oil &amp; Gas, which would include Western building a sulphuric acid plant at its Kalgoorlie nickel smelter to process the ore. Mr Barnett said Western Australia was relatively unexplored for minerals, while the potential for offshore oil and gas discoveries was huge. His government wanted to see state revenue from natural resource projects quickly doubled. Direct royalties alone last year brought in ADollars 375m. However, the state's small population of 1.7m could not provide the necessary capital and this would come mainly from foreign investors. The government is to send high powered delegations around the would promoting Western Australia as 'a safe and reliable place to invest'.</p>

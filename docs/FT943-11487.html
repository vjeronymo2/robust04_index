			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bumper Queensland sugar output set to topple Cuba from pole position Australia is set to become the world's biggest raw sugar exporter this year, with a high sugar content cane crop in Queensland expected to push output beyond the forecast 4.4m tonnes, reports Reuters from Brisbane. The state's sugar output is likely to rise to over 4.6m tonnes according to the Canegrowers group. Mr Ian Ballantyne, Canegrowers general manager, said that the signs after a month of harvesting indicated that the record crop of 32m tonnes of cane had above average sugar content and would beat earlier sugar production forecasts. 'We have seen around a 10 per cent increase in the actual size of crop but about 15 per cent increase in the content of sugar,' he said. 'We definitely have 4.4m tonnes of sugar there but probably more.' About 85 per cent of Australia's raw sugar is exported with 3.36m tonnes going overseas last year. This made Australian sugar exports the world's second largest after Cuba's 3.6m tonnes. Australia is hoping to take the number one position this year with a third successive good crop and with Cuba's sugar production falling to about 4m tonnes. Last year Queensland produced 4.02m tonnes of sugar with the only other growing state, New South Wales, producing its annual average of around 200,000 tonnes. 'There is just no question that the 1994 growing season will produce a very good crop of sugar after a bit of a ragged start,' Mr Ballantyne said. So far, only about 20 per cent of the country's crop has been harvested.</p>

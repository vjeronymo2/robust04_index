			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Tolls will be steep on the high road to Skye: Islanders are angry at the prospect of paying Pounds 5 a car to use the new bridge The bridge which some people say will take the magic out of going over the sea to Skye is becoming a reality. Against a backdrop of snow-topped mountains, the two stubby concrete towers which will support the main part of the Skye bridge are almost complete. All day a landing craft shuttles back and forth through the icy winds across the Kyle of Lochalsh, ferrying concrete mixers to pour their load into the structures taking shape on the mainland side. Though the bridge is several months behind its contractors' original schedule, it is still expected to open as planned in August next year. It is a project which arouses mixed emotions. Most of the 9,000 people on Skye welcome the greater convenience the bridge will offer in travelling to the mainland compared with the Caledonian MacBrayne ferry service, which will cease. But they are angry that they will have to pay tolls on the bridge for about 15 years, beginning at the same rate as those of the ferry and rising with inflation. With present tariffs that would work out at Pounds 5 per car in summer and Pounds 4 in winter, probably the highest tolls in Britain. Regular users would have discounts. There is also lingering resentment at the way the Scottish Office ignored local objections to paying tolls in deciding that Skye should have the first privately financed bridge in Scotland. It will be only the second in Britain, after the Dartford bridge on the Thames which opened in 1991. The privately financed second Severn Bridge is due to open in 1996. The contractors see the project as a potentially profitable scheme that will produce an elegant bridge. In the words of Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, a Scottish Office minister, it will 'skip lightly over the islands'. As well as the 500-metre main bridge between Skye and the island of Eilean Ban - the last home of the writer Gavin Maxwell - there will be a 196m secondary bridge between Eilean Ban and the mainland. The contractors are a joint venture between Miller Construction, a privately owned Edinburgh company, and Dykerhoff &amp; Widman, usually known as Dywidag. The designer is Dywidag, which specialises in this type of construction - the Skye bridge is a pre-stressed, post-tensioned concrete box girder bridge. The two companies are also involved in Skye Bridge, a consortium formed with Bank of America which is raising Pounds 17m to pay for the bridge. It will recoup the construction cost from tolls and then hand the bridge over to the Scottish Office. The government is paying Pounds 6m for connecting roads. 'The main problem we face is one of logistics,' says Mr John Henderson, senior project manager. 'The weather here can change drastically in minutes. Then there are strong tides and currents.' Miller Dywidag hit serious delays last year in bedding the two concrete caissons which form the base of the towers into the rocky seabed. But that problem was overcome and over the next few months the main bridge will extend outwards step by step from the two towers as successive concrete segments are cast. The project finds little favour with Mrs Kathleen MacRae who lives a few miles into Skye at Breakish and is secretary of the Skye Bridge Appeal Group, a grouping of the bridge's critics. 'All the time we agitated for a bridge it was assumed that it would be a part of the road system. We were horrified when we were told we would have to pay tolls if we wanted the bridge in less than 20 years.' She fears that the demise of the five-minute ferry trip will make Skye less attractive to tourists, so that bridge traffic will grow slowly and the tolls will operate for more than the expected 15 years. Nevertheless at peak times queues for the ferry can be an hour or two long. Mr Bob Wilson, a director of Miller Civil Engineering, says: 'I can't see how the bridge won't improve the island's economy. What people forget is that if there were no bridge there would always be tolls on the ferries. With a bridge the tolls will come to an end.' Mrs MacRae says: 'There will always be tolls, even when the Scottish Office takes over. Can you name a single bridge in Britain where tolls have come to an end?'</p>

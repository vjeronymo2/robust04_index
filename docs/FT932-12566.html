			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / ITC chief warns on pursuit of ratings THE INDEPENDENT Tele-vision Commission yesterday warned both ITV and Channel 4 not to go too far in the pursuit of ratings at the expense of programme obligations. Mr David Glencross, ITC chief executive, said that although the start of the new ITV licences had gone better than expected there were still areas of concern. He said viewers of religious programmes were less well-served, and the scheduling of The South Bank Show, the Sunday arts programme, was edging closer to 11pm than 10.30pm. 'It will not take much more slippage of this kind for the ITC to question seriously whether the quality and diversity of the service required by the 1990 (Broadcasting) Act was in fact being met,' he told the annual conference of the Viewers and Listeners Association in London. Channel 4 - now winning 11.5 per cent of viewing - was right, he said, to expand its audience share. He did not believe it had breached its remit to appeal to tastes not catered for elsewhere. 'But there is a temptation for Channel 4 to go that extra inch for a little more revenue, a little more audience and I believe at the margins of choice the competitive instincts of the channel must yield to the sanctity of the remit,' Mr Glencross warned.</p>

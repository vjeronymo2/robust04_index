We All Are in the Clutches of the State"]    [Text] Our readers will know that an absolute majority of  dailies and weeklies of Moscow and of all Russia are ready to  interrupt their publication for the duration of the next week.  As this issue of "NG" is going to print (the last issue during  this "short" pre-Christmas week), such a decision was confirmed  at the conference of chief editors that took place last night.  Readers are entitled to know what "NG" editors are being guided  by in this protest action.    First and foremost, this is no classic strike. The editorial  office will work, gather information, and journalists will write  articles. True, the newspaper will not be printed. Subscribers  and readers in general will be the worse for it, as well as the  numerous "NG" contributors whose articles are in next week's  plans but will not be published. On behalf of the editorial  office I apologize to all of them, but we have to do this.    "NG" was not the initiator of this action, yet it will take  part in it because it has more than once experienced not only  the absence of journalist solidarity in Moscow and Russia (the  story of our repeat registration), but also a direct and  aggressive non-solidarity (attacks on "NG" and other newspapers  for the "blank spaces" instead of censured material).    Not many people understand the main economic sense of  journalists' demands. Stripped of unessential nuances, the crux  of the problem is as follows.    The revaluation of the fixed assets introduced by government  decree No. 1233 automatically leads to an increase in all and  sundry payments and taxes, etc. To be effected by the owners of  these assets. In our case, by the printing and publishing  complexes. They would naturally put the burden on their  customers, or newspapers and magazines. Hence there will be a  doubling or quadrupling (to begin with) of the costs of printing  services for editorial offices. According to one version, there  is not a direct dependence here, because printers capitalized on  this decree in their own interests.    Why was "NG" not the first to propose this action? Just  because the relatively small print run of our newspaper takes  smaller funds than of those newspapers whose circulation runs to  1 million copies. While we paid, say, 10 million in December, in  January we will be obliged to pay 40 million, i.e. 30 million  over and above. A newspaper publishing 1 million copies would  have to pay 400 million in January instead of 100 million rubles  in December, meaning that it would have to "find" another 300  million.    But the thing is that it is the state that owns all printing  shops in Russia, as it owned them in the USSR before. A  complete monopoly has been preserved here. Therefore, all of us  -- and you, readers, too -- are in the clutches of this state.  Or more precisely, the government that runs this property and  us all as it sees fit.    It needs only one thing: a monopoly on the distribution of  information. Which is why the freedom of speech in Russia is  hanging by a thread. It is there but it is hanging. Thus it  will perhaps exist until the government becomes sick of it.    Till we meet again in 10 days or perhaps earlier?    We shall see.</p>

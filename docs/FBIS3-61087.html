			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Georgiy Bovt and Natalya Kalashnikova under the </F> "Foreign Banks in Russia" rubric: "Europe Is Not Used To  Changing the Rules in the Middle of the Game"]    [Text] Boris Yeltsin's edict "On the Activities of  Foreign Banks and Jointly Owned Banks With the Participation of  Non-Residents' Capital on the Territory of the Russian  Federation" (see KOMMERSANT No. 46, p. 5), whose issuance was  prompted, judging by the comments of some of its supporters, by  considerations of "healthy protectionism," did not go unnoticed  in international financial and economic circles. The negative  reaction to the proscriptive sanctions of the edict on the part  of a number of Western commercial banks, including some that are  members of the London Club of Russia's creditors, was joined by  the EU Commission [EUC]. Last week, EUC Deputy Chairman Sir Leon  Britten sent a letter to Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr  Shokhin, who heads the Russian delegation at the EU  negotiations. The bewilderment on the part of Russia's Western  European partners is quite understandable: The EU mandate was  the centerpiece of negotiations between Boris Yeltsin and the  EUC Chairman Jacques Delors, which took place in Moscow on 11  November, and then the president's edict, which nullified these  agreements, came out in less than a week.    Representatives of Russia's Choice in the government  unanimously supported the edict; Viktor Gerashchenko, on the  other hand, took an unequivocal stand against it (see KOMMERSANT  No. 46, pp. 4-6), thereby provoking a statement signed on behalf  of the Association of Russian Commercial Banks by Mssrs. Yegorov  and Vinogradov. At the same time, a group of influential bankers  in their response statement supported the position of the  Central Bank of Russia's chairman, referring, in particular, to  the impermissibility of torpedoing the agreements reached with  the EU.  <H5>  How a Compromise Was Reached and What Is at Stake </H5>   It took a year and a half of difficult negotiations to  enable  Boris Yeltsin and Jacques Delors to declare in November at the  first Russian-European summit that practically all hurdles in  the way of signing a partnership agreement had been overcome.  The agreements, reached as a result of a series of mutual  concessions and compromises, legally formalized the trade and  economic equality in bilateral relations: The EU recognized  Russia as a "country with an economy in a state of transition"  (until then it had been treated as a "country with a state-run  economy"). Europe also agreed to other major compromises. This  included, in particular, the conditions for applying protective  measures and most-favored treatment in trade; suspending  quantitative restrictions; and freedom of commodity transit. An  agreement was also reached on the question of antidumping  procedures (the EUC applies them to 15 items of Russian  exports). According to the agreements reached, antidumping  sanctions are to be preceded by consultations, which will allow  the disposal of the issues under dispute at the early stage of  the conflict. In addition, the EU undertook an obligation to  take into account Russia's competitive advantages resulting from  the presence of its own raw materials base and the optimum  volume in certain types of production.    Certain progress also was reached in the commercial services  market. Now the European partners are willing to remove all  barriers in the path of unrestricted and competitive price  formation: They have accepted the idea of the so-called  "evolutionary provision." In accordance with this, an agreement  between the parties is to be reached on all specific issues in  this area before the partnership agreement expires. According to  Aleksandr Shokhin's data, in the event that the West removes the  restrictions, Russia can claim 20-25 percent of the space  market. Overall, as the program for developing nontraditional  exports is implemented, by the middle of 1990's income from  exports may increase by $5 billion-$6 billion. An agreement was  also reached on the provisions with respect to liberalization of  coal and steel sales, as well as the terms of mutual trade in  the event of EU expansion through addition of third countries.  Also coordinated were positions on transborder trade in  services. The parties agreed on granting the most-favored  treatment to companies at the stage of formation and the  national laws at the stage of their operations, taking into  account exceptions from the national laws.    This, as well as a number of other preliminary agreements,  which in essence meant for Russia a breakthrough into European  markets of goods and services, were reached upon the EU  condition, among other things, of granting European banks  operating on the territory of Russia most-favored treatment.  Taking into account the need to protect Russian banks in open  competition with Western ones, Moscow agreed to this proposal  only on condition of applying to foreign banks Russian national  laws with a number of exceptions. Aleksandr Shokhin held special  consultations with Russian bankers on this matter. On 27 October  EUC Deputy Chairman Sir Leon Britten was informed of the results  of these consultations.    Moscow's decision consisted of the following. At the  stage of setting up their operations, EU banks would get  most-favored treatment, and for five years after signing the  Partnership Agreement with the EU the following exceptions from  national laws would remain in force for these banks. First, the  restriction on the number of branches opened by the banks on the  territory of the Russian Federation; second, a limit on a  minimum deposit in the amount equivalent to 100,000 ECU for each  individual deposit; third, a ban on operations involving  placement of assets, as well as conducting middlemen (brokerage)  operations with joint-stock societies' stocks and privatization  vouchers. The aforementioned exceptions were not to extend to  joint-ownership banks with a more than 30 percent participation  share of Russian shareholders. Over the transition period,  Russia undertook an obligation not to change the terms of banks'  operations (already opened as of the date of signing the  Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with the EU) in the  direction of worsening (limiting) operational environment.    These are Russian proposals that were accepted by the EUC.  It  was as a result of this compromise solution that the Commission  petitioned the EU Council of Ministers, asking that a new  mandate be granted for the completion of agreements with Russia.  And it was granted precisely on the basis of these agreements.  The provisions of this mandate--which, naturally, include  agreements on banks--served as a basis of negotiations at the  first Russian-European summit in Moscow on 11 November, where  both parties unanimously declared a breakthrough in bilateral  economic relations. It was agreed, in particular, that on 8-10  December Boris Yeltsin would visit Brussels and would sign  together with Jacques Delors a Political Declaration, which  would register the intent of the parties to conclude a  partnership agreement as soon as possible. At the time it was  assumed that its text in English may be initialed (after the  experts fine-tune the draft) as early as in the end of December,  and by the spring the agreement may be signed by all 12 EU  countries individually. The situation, however, changed only six  days later: The entire blueprint for a compromise was nullified  by one stroke of the presidential pen. Rumors began spreading in  Europe and in Russia that once again someone was directing his  hand. A reasonable question then is: Qui prodest?  <H5>  How the Compromise Was Brought to Naught </H5>   Let us remind the reader that the edict "On Activities of  Foreign Banks...." signed by the president on 17 November simply  barred foreign and jointly owned banks (which had not begun  doing so before 15 November 1993) from working with residents of  Russia until 1 January 1996. At the time of the signing of the  edict, only two fully foreign-owned banks (Lionskiy Kredit, a  subsidiary of Credit Lyonnais, and a bank jointly owned by the  Dresdner Bank [FRG] and BNP [France]) had begun their  operations. The rest, who only intended to begin operations in  the Russian market, "had their rights taken away."    The reaction to the edict in Russian financial and political  circles was swift. It left one with the impression, however,  that many of those who by definition are supposed to prepare  documents of this sort not only had nothing to do with it, but  had not even been informed of its preparation.    At least Viktor Gerashchenko, the head of the Central Bank  of  Russia, and Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Shokhin, whose  responsibilities include foreign economic relations, having  disowned any participation in the edict's preparation, in  essence questioned its legitimacy. Viktor Gerashchenko explained  the issuance of the edict by the fact that "in the course of the  election campaign some commercial banks, fearing competition and  wishing to develop as monopolies, exerted certain pressure on  the president's staff." Deputy Minister of Finance Aleksandr  Pochinok, in turn, hinted that the ministry has nothing  whatsoever against the presence of foreign banks in Russia. His  boss, Boris Fedorov, however (at a meeting in the KOMMERSANT  editorial offices, see KOMMERSANT No. 47, pp. 4-5) was more  frank, and praised the edict in extremely positive terms. In the  process, he did not miss the opportunity to drop that "nobody in  the government is aware of what Shokhin agreed on with the EU."  And he hinted that, in his opinion, the compromise reached with  the EUC does not mean anything.    What remains open is another, and also quite reasonable  question: Why the decision on banks, which generally should have  been made (or at least worked out and discussed) by the  government, came out in the form of a presidential edict?  <H5>  What Next? </H5>   While from the standpoint of domestic policy the edict once  again showed the unpredictability of the presidential team's  actions, which often prefers to act autonomously from the  government, in the foreign economic sphere it jeopardized the  holding of another summit between the president of Russia and  the European Union (which is already scheduled for 9  December)--a fact about which the edict supporters remained  modestly silent.    Such a sudden change in the rules of the game may have  far-reaching negative consequences for Moscow: The  scheduled--already eighth--round of negotiations with the EU,  which took place last week, already demonstrated this  graphically. Now the Russian delegation had to "regroup in  action" at the negotiations with the EU, searching for a new  compromise. In Shokhin's opinion, there is no choice other than  bringing together two positions that are hard to reconcile. That  is: Until the agreement with the EU comes into force, offshore  terms of the presidential decree will be in effect, and after  the agreement in signed--the exceptions on which an agreement of  the EUC already has been reached will go into force.    It cannot be precluded, however, that watching Moscow's  unpredictable maneuvers, the EU may lean toward toughening of  the Union's negotiating position as a whole. There already have  been some indications of this: During the latest round of  negotiations in Moscow, the parties were unable to reconcile  their positions on exports of Russian enriched uranium into the  EU; neither is a solution to the "aluminum problem" in sight. It  appears that now the EU will redouble its efforts in insisting  on making special provisions in the agreement permitting the  suspension of its action in the event that its substantive  elements are violated. It is possible that the provision on  violating the principles of a market economy, already removed at  the proposal of Russia, will be reanimated again. This  provision, in Shokhin's opinion, could be used by EU countries  whenever the economic conditions worsened. Neither is the EU  ready yet to accept Russia's request for access to European  Investment Bank's credits. There is also another provision in  the draft agreement that links economic partnership with  Russia's observance of "human rights."    It appears that the reaction of the London Club at the  negotiations on the restructuring of Russian foreign debts also  will come fairly soon. After all, members of this club are  precisely the same banks that fell victim to the president's  action. As is known, Russia has not accepted the club's proposal  on forfeiting sovereign immunity in guaranteeing the debt. It  looks as if the London Club is in no hurry now to come up with  compromise proposals, however.    If the banking conflict is not extinguished in the nearest  future, we can also hardly expect a tidal wave of investment  into the Russian economy, because that is precisely how the  investment was supposed to be channeled--through foreign banks.  In any case, the Deutsche Bank, one of Russia's largest  creditors and investors, has already openly made a statement to  this effect.    [Box p 18]  <H5>  Statement of Four Banks </H5>   As KOMMERSANT's editors have learned, on 3 December the  leadership of four major Moscow banks, which operate actively in  European financial markets, signed a statement (the text is  published below), in which they disassociated themselves from  the position of the Association of Russian Banks and the Moscow  Banking Union on the issue of the fate of foreign banks in  Russia. According to information received by the editors,  Rosselkhozbank chairman Nikolay Likhachev was supposed to join  "the statement of four" but for a tragic reason was not able to  do it.    In the opinion of KOMMERSANT experts, the statement  authors' support for the Central Bank of Russia's position and  that of many influential Western bankers regarding the  impermissibility of discrimination against foreign banks was  prompted not so much by a purely academic interest in the  problem as the desire to minimize obstacles in the path of their  own projects--current and future--in foreign financial  markets.    "On 23 November, Mssrs. S.Ye. Yegorov and V.V. Vinogradov,  the top officials of the Association of Russian Banks [ARB] and  the Moscow Banking Union [MBU], issued a statement on behalf of  these public organizations, in which they supported the  restrictive measures against foreign banks in Russia envisaged  in the 17 November edict "On the Activities of Foreign Banks and  Jointly Owned Banks With the Participation of Non-Residents'  Capital on the Territory of the Russian Federation." This  statement also contains a negative appraisal of the position of  Central Bank of Russia Chairman Mr. V.V. Gerashchenko, who has  expressed doubts regarding the expediency of such measures in  the current circumstances.    "We, the leadership of a number of major commercial banks,  want to attract the public's attention to the fact that Mssrs.  S.Ye. Yegorov and V.V. Vinogradov's statement were not  coordinated with our banks and many other commercial banks that  are members of the ARB and the MBU. This statement does not  express at all a common position of all commercial banks in  Russia and therefore may be regarded only as the personal  viewpoint of the persons who signed it.    "In this connection, we find it necessary to point out that  we consistently (and no less than the leadership of public  banking organizations) support the course of the president and  the government toward the intensification of economic reforms,  development of Russia's financial system, strengthening of the  ruble, and protection of national interests in the banking  sphere. Our banks, not in words but in deed, make a considerable  contribution to the improvement of the Russian economy, its  revitalization and modernization, and the preservation of the  rich existing potential of domestic industry. We also make a  considerable effort to gain worthy positions for Russian banks  in the international banking community, for the development of  equal trade and economic cooperation with foreign partners and  for attracting to Russia foreign financial resources on a  healthy basis.    "We believe that the real effectiveness of the declared  measures is questionable. Moreover. In the event that these  measures are implemented, operations of existing branches and  representations of Russian banks in foreign countries will  inevitably become considerably more difficult; there will arise  obstacles in opening new Russian banking institutions abroad;  and the mistrust toward our financial-banking institutions, born  of the catastrophic legacy of the former USSR, will rise again.  The unpredictability of regulatory activity in Russia has  revealed itself once again.    "On a broader scale, by creating a prominent precedent,  these  measures may reflect negatively on the process--very important  for Russia, and at the same time very difficult--of forming  principally new politico-economic relations between our country  and the rest of the world, first and foremost with partners from  among the states with developed economies. For instance, by the  estimate of some members of the Russian Government and a number  of high-ranking European figures, these measures, to put it  mildly, do not quite correspond to the agreements on the status  of foreign banks in Russia, which have been reached with  considerable difficulty at the negotiations with the European  Union and which are to become a part of a package of global  agreements between Russia and the EU, ready to be discussed at  the highest level during the president of Russia's visit to  Brussels scheduled for 9 December.    "Legalization of restrictive measures against foreign banks  in Russia, in our opinion, may reflect only the current  interests of some influential commercial banks and other  structures, which would like at any price to gain a monopoly  position in the domestic market in order to earn superprofits in  the current economic conditions. This, however, will not be  produce any benefit toward the normal development of the entire  banking system and the Russian economy as a whole."    [Signed] D.

Chudnovskiy,  chairman of the board of the Optimum commercial bank&gt;  [Signed]  V. Yakunin, president of the Tokobank joint-stock commercial bank    [Box p 18]  <H3>  AvtoVAZbank and Stolichnyy Granted Permits To Open Foreign  Branches. Now the Real Problems Are Ahead </H3>   The Central Bank of Russia [CBR] this week issued permission  for two Russian commercial banks to open foreign branches. The  AvtoVAZbank intends to open an office (with the status of a  branch) in Cyprus, and the Stolichnyy bank--a branch in  Amsterdam (Netherlands). The Central Bank has not considered the  National Credit bank's application for permission to open a  branch in the United States, since the latter has not submitted  all the required documentation to the CBR. For Stolichnyy, the  process of getting permission to open a branch (the working  capital is set at 100 million guilder) was long and torturous.  Now the Russian bank will have to begin negotiations with the  National Bank of the Netherlands regarding a license to operate  there. In turn, in accordance with licensing rules, the Bank of  the Netherlands in considering the question of issuing the  Russian bank a license will have to request a paper from the  Central Bank of Russia banking oversight service certifying the  reliability and solid standing of the candidate.    Nevertheless, KOMMERSANT experts believe that if anything is  capable of burying Stolichnyy's dream of a branch in  Netherlands, it is not the CBR's obstacles but its involvement  in the campaign launched by a number of Russian commercial banks  regarding limitation on activities of foreign banks in Russia.  (At the conference of bankers in the former Supreme Soviet, a  Stolichnyy representative supported applying restrictions to  foreign colleagues). It so happens that Dutch banks--ING and ABN  AMRO Bank--felt more painfully than others the blow dealt to  foreign banks that have come to Russia. No sooner did they get  general licenses from the CBR than they lost them. Moreover, the  ABN AMRO Bank, having received a license from the Central Bank  of Russia, signed an agreement to set up in Kazakhstan a joint  bank ABN Amro Kazakhstan--apparently with a great hope of  expanding operations through the opportunity to work with  rubles. (The cofounders of the joint bank in Kazakhstan, with a  charter capital of $5 million, were Kramede-Bank, and on the  Russian side--the International Financial Corporation).</p>

			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Scantronic shows advance to Pounds 3.09m STRONG EUROPEAN markets helped Scantronic Holdings, the security components supplier and manufacturer, lift pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.54m to Pounds 3.09m in the year to March 31. Mr Ray Dias, finance director, said the company did not adopt FRS 3 ti wanted to report separately exceptional and extraordinary provisions relating to litigation. The group took a Pounds 444,000 exceptional charge for doubtful trading debt due from Alarm Parts and a Pounds 1.5m extraordinary cahrge mainly against costs relating to the damages claim against the former owner of Arrowhead, a US acquisition. Turnover rose to Pounds 39.1m (Pounds 36.1m). Mr Wallace Clapperton, chairman, said European markets were the main area where progress was achieved. 'Mainland European sales benefited from increased original equipment manufacture business which more than countered recessionary conditions.' European operations contributed turnover of Pounds 30.4m (Pounds 26.2m) and operating profits of Pounds 3.99m (Pounds 3.55m). Scantronic has now split continental and UK operations to give 'greater focus' to the overseas business, where it has a low market share. There was a reduced operating loss of Pounds 153,000 (Pounds 591,000) from the North American operations although turnover slipped to Pounds 8.68m (Pounds 9.86m). Mr Clapperton said: 'Despite our earlier expectations, the North American market showed no sign of upturn. Progress to bring operations into line with existing business levels was achieved through the strengthening of local management and the launch of new products.' Scantronic maintained a Pounds 2m spend on research and development, some 5 per cent of sales. Gearing was held at just under 20 per cent, and the company generated more than Pounds 5m in cash for the second year in succession, including Pounds 1m from US operations. Net interest charges fell to Pounds 311,000 (Pounds 422,000). The final dividend is 2.331p (2.185p) making 3.121p (2.975p) for the year, payable from earnings of 4.05p (2.18p).</p>

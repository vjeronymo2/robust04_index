Shirokaya, </F> Hydrobiology Institute at the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences,  Kiev; UDC [(577.34:574.5):621.31](282.247.32)]    [Abstract] Radioecological studies of the Kiev reservoir's  littoral zone conducted both before (1979-1986) and after  (1986-1991) the Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident are  reviewed, and the importance of the littoral areas due to the  development of a many aquatic plants and invertebrates is  stressed. A comparison of the radionuclide accumulation levels  and parameters in the littoral component would make it possible  realistically to assess the impact of radiative contamination,  understand the radionuclide dynamics in abiotic and biotic  components, and identify the radionuclide accumulation traits in  hydrobionts at various trophic levels under the conditions of  global and accident-related radioactive contamination of plain  reservoirs. The study methods and materials and sampling  procedures are outlined. The radionuclide concentration was  measured by radiochemistry and _g_-spectrometry methods using  an  instrument consisting of a DGDK-40A detector, a system of Vektor  input modules, and AI-4096-A90 amplitude analyzer. The  concentration of long-lived radionuclides ([.sup]90[/]Sr and [.sup]137  [/]  Cs) in the ecosystem components in 1979, the  accumulation coefficients, contribution, and ratio of long-lived  radionuclides in the ecosystem components in 1979, the  contribution of [.sup]90[/]Sr and [.sup]134[/]  Cs+[.sup]137[/]Cs to the total radioactivity  of ecosystem components in 1986-1991, and the radionuclide  accumulation coefficients in the ecosystem components in May-Jun  86 are summarized. The study shows that the radionuclide  concentration dynamics are due to the washing out of radioactive  elements from the 30 km zone around the nuclear plant and depend  on the complex hydrological and hydrochemical processes in the  estuary of the Pripyat river and littoral zone. Since 1987,  strontium made a dominant contribution to the radionuclide  content in the water and mollusks while cesium has been detected  in fish since mid-1986 and in higher aquatic plants--since 1988.

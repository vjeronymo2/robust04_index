			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Survey of France (3): Crisis to be defused by dialogue / Profile of Edouard Balladur he was born into an expatriate French banking family in Turkey - which hides qualities of toughness and pragmatism in France's 64 year old prime minister. Both qualities have been in evidence in his first 12 weeks at the Matignon. He has imposed on French farmers acceptance of the EC's oilseeds accord with the US - a very small step for the Gatt negotiations, but a big one for a French prime minister. Furthermore, he has travelled to Brussels and Washington to tell France's partners that Paris will go no further towards agricultural trade reform until and unless it sees non-farm concessions on the table. He has quickly had to bend to the winds of recession, capping a May 10 austerity budget with measures on May 25 to try to boost economic recovery. And, over military base cuts, he has quelled a revolt of his own RPR Gaullist backbenchers against his defence minister of another party, Mr Francois Leotard of the UDF. Stamped by his years working for Georges Pompidou, Mr Balladur is a moderate Gaullist; a believer in consensus at home and a pro-European in foreign policy. His experience of being at Pompidou's side in May 1968 will stand him in good stead in future crises - which, however, he hopes to defuse by dialogue; he has talked to the unions, as well as the employers, more than the Socialists recently did. As finance minister (1986-88), Mr Balladur was the first to launch the idea of a European central bank. He is no free trader; very few French are. But he is realistic enough to know that France must use persuasion as much as pressure to make its European Community partners see the Gatt through French eyes. Might he make a run for the presidency in 1995? Edouard Balladur has always maintained that his ambition goes no further than to be a successful prime minister - that, indeed, is the basis of his close entente with Mr Jacques Chirac, the energetic 60 year old mayor of Paris. Mr Chirac wants the Elysee  -residence of the French presidency  - as much as ever. But success at the Matignon could yet suck Mr Balladur into the contest.</p>

			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / International Company News: MCI wins Bank of America contract MCI Communications yesterday underlined its fast growth by announcing its largest-ever contract, worth more than Dollars 250m, to be the primary long-distance carrier for Bank of America, the second-largest US bank. MCI, the second-largest long-distance telecommunications group in the US, has been increasing its traffic at up to twice the industry average in recent quarters, due to numerous new business contracts and an innovative consumer discount programme. The Bank of America deal is one of several important accounts it has picked up in the financial services sector. Last May, it won a four-year, Dollars 250m contract to be the primary carrier of long-distance US voice services for Citicorp, the largest US bank. MCI declined to give details of the Bank of America deal but said it would provide the company with a wide range of domestic and international voice and data services.</p>

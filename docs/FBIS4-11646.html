			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Maryam M. Shahin] </F>   [Text] Amman--A group of over 60 Palestinian and Jordanian  businessmen have founded an investment company with an initial  capital of over $100 million to jump-start the economy of the  West Bank and Gaza even before Palestinain self-rule is  implemented there.    Today the founders of the company, officially registered as  an off-shore firm in Liberia due to the still lucid political  conditions in the occupied territories, will elect their board  of trustees at the Amman Chamber of Industry.    The Palestine Company for Development and Investment (PCDI)  is to be a public share-holding company which is founded by  mostly millionaire Palestinian businessmen based in and outside  the Arab World.    The founding members who spoke to the Jordan Times Tuesday  asked to stay anonymous until after the board of trustee  elections.    "After the elections most of the founders and investors will  be known to the public. There is no need to publicize names  before-hand," said the company's Amman spokesman Rajaii al-Masri.    The company plans to invigorate the Palestinian economy by  building much of the housing and industrial infrastructure  needed to upgrade the living and working conditions of the  almost two million Palestinians living in the occupied  territories in the next 10 years.    Addressing many in the occupied territories who fear an  "economic takeover" by Diaspora Palestinians once self-rule is  implemented, company founders say the development projects will  employ local expertise, labour and use locally-made building  materials wherever available.    PCDI has three main "priority projects." The first is to  build reasonably priced modern middle class housing projects  throughout the West Bank, Gaza and possibly East Jerusalem.    The second most "urgent" objective is to build "heavy"  industries. While investors who spoke to the JORDAN TIMES  declined to be specific, a cement plant was given as one  possible example. The third most important objective is to build  smaller self- sustaining industries.    Another "IMMEDIATE PROJECT" will include a chain of medium  sized hotels in all the major cities and towns in the occupied  territories, for the "throngs of Palestinian and Arab visitors"  that are expected to converge on the occupied territories in the  near future.    PCDI has been years in the making. According to company  sources, development projects founded and supported by the  Geneva-based Welfare Association have been vigorously analysed  to serve as a blue print for economic needs "large and small" in  the occupied territories. But unlike the Welfare Association,  which is a non-profit foundation for humanitarian and  development assistance for Palestinians, PCDI is a large-scale  business venture.    The company was officially registered in Liberia in October  1993 and will remain listed as an off-shore company until the  political climate surrounding self-rule "stabilises," Mr.  al-Masri said.    Company stocks will be listed in a Palestinian stock market  once that is set up in the occupied territories. An initial  suggestion for the location of a Palestinian stock market has  been Ramallah, Bethlehem or Nablus.    PCDI founders say the company will have several  subsidiaries.    One such firm, the Ruwad Filistine Company, a construction  firm, is already being set up in the occupied territories.    More than half of PCDI shares (or 51 per cent) will be owned  by people who live inside the occupied territories, Mr. al-Masri  says. The rest will be owned by Jordanian and Diaspora  Palestinians.    Before the company becomes fully operational the investors  hope that the starting capital would have increased to $200  million.    Before the shares go on sale to the general public, initial  capital raising begins with those investing a minimum of  $100,000 with a maximum capital ceiling of investment put at $2  million.    While the majority of the investors thus far have been  Diaspora Palestinians, followed by Jordanian Palestinians and  others living in Arab countries, a few West Bank and Gaza  investors have also invested.    While many of the Diaspora and Jordan-based Palestinians  have  invested the maximum $2 million, none of the West Bank and Gaza  based investors have been able to do so thus far," said one of  the investors.    The degree of autonomy the company will have from  Palestinian  government and Israeli interference is still to be worked out,  founders say. "We expect a very large degree of economic  autonomy," said one leading investor.    Most company founders still prefer relative anonymity citing  both political and personal reasons. "The political situation  is still too fluid," said a leading founder, "most of the  investors are nationals of countries other than Jordan and to  play such a major role in the building of another economy needs  indirect approval from certain quarters. So until everything is  perfectly clear most prefer anonymity."    But those investors who are Jordanians national, who form a  "good third if not a half" of the founding investors, have an  implicit approval from the Jordanian Government. "Jordan and  Palestine are intricately linked and the only non-Palestinians  to found the company are Jordanians. So it is a special  relationship," said one of the founding members, Nidal Sukhtyan.    But the Jordanian Government is not the only government to  have been consulted about PCDI. The Palestine Liberation  Organisation (PLO) too has been extensively briefed about the  company's plans and intentions and has given its tacit approval.    "The Palestinian entity will be one in which the open market  rules and business community will bank roll the economy.  Naturally the PLO approves," said one founder.    Individuals, companies and banks are among the initial  founders of the PCDI and the board of trustees to be elected  today is likely to include the economically most powerful people  in the lands to come under Palestinian control.</p>

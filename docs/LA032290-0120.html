			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> NIGHT LIFE;  </P> <P> FIDDLE PLAYING MAKES RAINDOGS A BAND APART  </P> <P> The Raindogs are this week's killer guitar band with possibilities.  </P> <P> Not only is this Boston band tighter than your boss, but their songs are full  of insightful lyrics and have more hooks than "Peter Pan," not to mention a  scene-stealing fiddle player, Johnny Cunningham. With a just-released debut  album, "Lost Souls," the Raindogs will play the Ventura Theatre on Friday  night.  </P> <P> And just as every musician that ever played has come back or won't go away,  every band -- pretty much -- comes from some other band. The Raindogs come from  plenty of other bands.  </P> <P> Triple-threat guitarist/singer/songwriter Mark Cutler was the leader of those  Rhode Island rockers that never quite made the big time, the Schemers. Second  guitarist Emerson Torrey, also from the Schemers, has been playing with Cutler  for nearly a decade.  </P> <P> The bass player, Darren Hill, used to be in the Red Rockers, who had a hit with  the catchy "China" back in 1983. Hill, from Louisiana, brings a folksy Cajun  influence to the band. Drummer Jimmy Reilly, from Belfast, used to be in the  influential punk/pop group Stiff Little Fingers and later the Red Rockers.  </P> <P> Cunningham, from Edinburgh, Scotland, is a fiddle virtuoso, who played for the  Scottish National Orchestra when he was just 11. Later he founded Silly Wizard,  a critically acclaimed folk group. When Cutler, Torrey and Cunningham get it  going on some of the Raindogs' rockers -- such as "May Your Heart Keep Beating"  and "Under the Rainbow" -- they create a sound that is as different as it is  accessible, sort of, but not like Big Country or the Jesus and Mary Chain. But  it's Cunningham's fiddle playing that sets the Raindogs apart from those other  ten zillion roots-rhythm-and-booze-bar-bands of your dreams.  </P> <P> And Cutler is a clever songwriter, specializing in the timeless love lost/love  lousy school of deadpan sniveling with a great beat.  </P> <P> And how's this for a grab-your-umbrella Dream Concert: The Raindogs, the  Rainmakers, the Raindrops and Rain Parade? Not this time -- the Raindogs will  be opening for one of the wittiest writers in rock, the outrageous Warren  Zevon. He's touring in a thinly veiled effort to sell copies of his latest  record, "Transverse City."  </P> <P> Hey, need a BMW? Doesn't everyone? Just go to any rock concert -- they're  giving them away. In addition to wreaking serious damage to your ears with loud  music, there's also serious damage to your wallet what with twenty-buck  tickets, twenty-buck T-shirts, three bucks for a draft beer, and continuing  education, in which security everywhere teaches Rude 101. Oh, and those BMWs --  that's "basic monotonous wait," as in what happens between acts.  </P> <P> That's when you actually have to talk to your date, try to get a drink from a  bartender, waste your few good years in line at the bathroom, all the while  listening to the world's worst tape that every venue inevitably inflicts upon  its patrons.  </P> <P> Suggestion: I realize this is stupid, but why can't bands follow each other,  say, five minutes apart? It's the '90s -- the technology is there. Or at least,  why not play a tape of the upcoming band? Or maybe show vintage Warner Bros.  cartoons, maybe an episode of "Married . . . With Children." Yeah, right, get  back in line.  </P> <P> WHERE TO GO  </P> <P> * THURSDAY  </P> <P> Something for Nothing, Spencer the Gardener. (Carnival Club, 634 State St.,  Santa Barbara, 962-9991.) Original tunes from a Ventura band and a Santa  Barbara band. SFN has more energy, but Spencer has more soul.  </P> <P> * FRIDAY  </P> <P> Warren Zevon, The Raindogs. (Ventura Theatre, 26 S. Chestnut, 648-1936.) One of  the wittiest writers in rock will be doing his new album and The Raindogs are  this week's Killer Guitar Band (with a fiddle player too).  </P> <P> * SATURDAY  </P> <P> Something for Nothing, The Mudheads, The I-Rails. (Charlie's Seaside Cafe, 362  California St., Ventura 648-6688.) Original rock at the beach featuring locals  playing, locals dancing, locals drinking; well, you know. . . .  </P> <P> * MONDAY  </P> <P> Michael on Fire. (Charlie's Seaside Cafe, 362 California St., Ventura 648-6688)  Clever, longhaired singer/songwriter with a voice that everyone on MTV wished  they had will play folk-inspired rockers from his vast repertoire.  </P> <P> * TUESDAY  </P> <P> They Might Be Giants (Ventura Theatre 26 S. Chestnut St., 648-1936.) Look in  the dictionary under "eclectic" and you'll see a picture of this band. Or try  "weird. . . .."  </P></p>

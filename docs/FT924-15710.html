			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1992 (11): Cost-saving system - Consultant's Critique THERE can be few things more disconcerting for a union negotiator than to see the management costing all your demands on a PC in front of you. KLM has integrated its system well enough to make this a practical reality. While shifting the balance of power towards managers, it also allows options to be considered that might otherwise have been rejected. Mr McCammon has shown remarkable talent in assembling a complex custom system from a collection of standard parts. The choice of a PC-based system has allowed him to select from a vast range of software options. The use of networks has allowed the system to have adequate power. After all,modern PCs have more raw power than many mainframes of only a few years ago. Though not all the links are yet filled in, the system meets the current needs. Unusually, Mr McCammon enters all the data himself - partly to ensure its correctness, but he does it mainly to keep him in touch with all that is happening in the company. This seems an excellent use of his time, given that it only takes an hour a day. Most executives would palm this off to a junior and then find themselves out of touch. The direct and indirect savings are many times the cost of the system. It is a tribute to the skills of Mr McCammon and his staff and no surprise that they won a national award. Key lessons from this study: Choose a flexible and extensible architecture. Get something done now, even if it is not yet perfect. Own the data from the top.</p>

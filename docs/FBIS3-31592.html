He announced that before noon he had been visited by  Parliament Chairman Ivan Gasparovic, who had shown him a draft  resolution by Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] deputies to be  adopted by the National Council should the prime minister not  agree to hold early elections in October this year.    The resolution proposes to cancel some previous Cabinet  decisions in the sphere of privatization of enterprises and to  have the course of action taken by the prime minister and Julius  Toth, the deputy prime minister and finance minister,  investigated by the General Prosecutor's Office. The resolution  calls on the two Cabinet officials to resign.    In this context, Vladimir Meciar said that he is asking the  General Prosecutor's Office to investigate the possibility of  this being attempted political blackmail. He added that this  illustrates the deep moral crisis of the politics of the SDL and  others who participated in this action.    Meciar went on to confirm that the Movement for a Democratic  Slovakia held talks yesterday evening about a broad coalition  with the representatives of the Slovak National Party, the SDL,  and the Christian Democratic Movement. However, he rejected  speculation that he had offered specific ministerial posts to  SDL Deputy Chairman Peter Kanis.</p>

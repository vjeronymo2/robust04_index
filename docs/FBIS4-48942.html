			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 29 (CNS) -- Purchase and sales in  the materials distribution and supply system suffered a sharp  setback in the first quarter this year with huge losses of over  RMB [Renminbi] 1 billion, the Vice Minister of Internal Trade  Mr. Ma Yimin disclosed at a meeting attended by managers of  electro- mechanical companies across the country. Information  released by the Ministry indicated that the purchase value was  put at RMB 68.62 billion while the sales value registered RMB  80.1 billion during the first quarter of this year. There were  9,000 enterprises under the system suffering a loss, making up  52 percent of the total. The sales of major kinds of materials  showed a comprehensive drop with cotton down by 51 percent,  steel material by 41 percent, aluminium- steel by 60 percent and  cars by 33 percent.    The loss, according to Mr. Ma, was mainly attributed to  investment in key construction items not in place while some  production enterprises suffered from a shortage of circulation  capital which in turn caused a slump in market demand. Second,  enterprises were not familiar with the new taxation system and  negative impacts were caused. Third, an increase in interest  represented a drop of profits. Fourth, measures adopted were  not so effective because of insufficient understanding of the  macro- economic situation. The vice minister asked personnel  within the system for great efforts to reverse the loss.</p>

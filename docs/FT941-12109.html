			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / The BMW/Rover Deal: Government shaken by backbench concern - Political Storm The government was taken aback yesterday at the scale of concern expressed by its own backbenchers over the loss of ownership of Britain's last big volume car manufacturer. Although many Conservative MPs welcomed the fact that BMW was prepared to pay Pounds 800m for Rover when it was sold to British Aerospace five years ago for just Pounds 150m, there was deep unease that no British buyer could be found. Mr Simon Coombs (Swindon) urged Mr Tim Sainsbury, minister for industry, 'to learn a lesson from the fact that there is no potential British purchaser of this excellent company'. He urged the Department of Trade and Industry 'to try to work out why that is the case?'. His view was echoed by Mr John Butcher, (Coventry South West) who warned that many people in the Midlands were 'anxious about the sale' and wanted reassurances about the deal. Sir Teddy Taylor, (Southend East) said it was regrettable that the sale was completed without the consent of Honda, which still controls 20 per cent of Rover. He asked Mr Sainsbury to ensure that the link between Honda and Rover was maintained. While Mr David Tredinnick (Bosworth) raised the possibility that BMW may want to build BMW cars in Rover plants. However, MPs on both side of the House were privately resigned to Britain losing ownership of Rover. Mr Sainsbury said ownership of Rover was a very low priority compared to the profitability of the company. He was supported by many on his own side when he argued that the real damage done to Rover was by bad industrial relations when the taxpayer had to spend billions of pounds on a loss making state-owned enterprise. Mr Robin Cook, Labour's shadow industry spokesman, singled out the sale price as confirmation that the government had sold the company off too cheaply to BAe five years ago. 'What is quite clear from today's purchase price is BMW has paid more than five times the amount for which this Government sold Rover group only five years ago. 'That clearly confirms the Audit Office's view that the price they got for it was a rip-off of the public sector and the taxpayer.'' A number of Labour MPs attacked the government for allowing Rover to be taken over by a big competitor. Mr Richard Caborn, Labour's chairman of the all-party Commons trade and industry select committee, asked whether the government was concerned that the lack of finance going into British manufacturing 'is forcing our best companies to sell sectors off'. Mr Robin Corbett, Labour MP for Birmingham Erdington, said he was not against 'sensible partnerships' but takeovers like this had got to be bad news. 'I think it is very sad after the way management and workforce at Rover worked their socks off that British Aerospace can simply chuck them overboard because they are a bit short of money.' Pressed further by Robert Ainsworth (Coventry North East) on what guarantees BMW had given on jobs, the minister insisted: 'No company is going to invest Pounds 800m to bring a business to an end.</p>

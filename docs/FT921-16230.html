			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Old guard moves over: Managers' changing age profile They were Mrs Margaret Thatcher's industrial disciples, carrying her message into the boardrooms and on to the shop floor. They were unforgiving, dynamic and enterprising, shameless about making money and fiercely proud of Britain. They were privateers like Lord King at British Airways who helped to transfer assets from public to private ownership; predators such as Lord Hanson and Sir Owen Greene, the chairman of BTR, who built conglomerates by acquiring and sorting out poorly performing companies; hard men such as Sir Robert Scholey who turned British Steel's overmanned and bloated plants into models of efficiency. With Mrs Thatcher's departure the time is drawing nigh when her industrial crusaders will follow her from the field of battle. The climate is changing, as Lord King puts it: 'Business will not be able to let rip in the 1990s as it did in the 1980s.' What was once the Thatcherite new guard in British management is turning into the old guard: Lord King is 74; Sir Robert 70; Lord Hanson and his partner Lord White were born in 1922 and 1923 and Sir Owen is 66. Has Thatcherism bequeathed a group of ageing entrepreneurs who will be swept away by a breed of spritely managers enthused by a very different business spirit for the 1990s? Mrs Thatcher's own qualities as a leader encouraged a cult of personality in business. Senior executives were lionised. It is unsurprising that men such as King and Hanson who have wielded such power over their baronies should be unwilling to retire. But these industrial crusaders are a high-profile minority. Apart from the Thatcherite old guard and a few other notable cases, such as the 73-year-old Mr Roland 'Tiny' Rowland's long tenure at Lonrho, and Lord Weinstock's service at the helm of the General Electric Company, there is little evidence that the British business leadership got significantly older in the 1980s. In 1989 the average age of the chairmen of the 50 largest British companies was between 59 and 60, the same as a decade before, according to a survey by Professor Leslie Hannah, of the London School of Economics' business history unit. While the 1980s encouraged a cult of personality at some companies, at others more formal procedures were introduced for the recruitment and replacement of chairmen and chief executives. Perhaps the best example was the smooth succession organised at Courtaulds by a 55-year-old Sir Christopher Hogg who appointed 39-year-old Mr Martin Taylor as chief executive of the textiles company and 52-year-old Mr Sipko Huismanns as chief executive of Courtaulds chemicals interests. Multinational companies such as Ford, IBM, ICI, Unilever and Shell have long had promotion policies which have produced chairmen of a similar age - in their early 50s at IBM and their late 50s at ICI. The 1980s were also a decade in which some young managers rose to prominence, such as Mr Peter Bonfield, the chairman and chief executive of ICL, the computer manufacturer, who at only 47 has spent a decade on the company's main board. The two most powerful men at BT, the telecommunications group, Mr Iain Vallance, the chairman, and Mr Barry Romeril, the finance director, are both 48. Indeed, a generation gap may be opening at the top of British business. The chairmen and non-executive directors, who safeguard the shareholders' interests and are responsible for the strategic direction of companies are usually in the late 50s or early 60s. Yet operating executives, who run companies day-to-day, are often in their 40s. At British Steel, for instance, Sir Robert will be replaced this summer as chairman by the 62-year-old Sir Alistair Frame. But the businesses are run by a group of 40-year-old young turks promoted in the past few years. This gap may grow. In the face of recession companies have become increasingly cautious about the selection of chairmen, favouring older, more experienced people, according to Mr David Kimbell, a headhunter with recruitment specialists Spencer Stuart. 'It is getting more difficult to persuade them to look at younger candidates,' he says. Yet bright young graduates will be attracted into industry only if they are offered executive responsibility early. In Mr John Major's cautious, low-growth Britain this new guard of younger operating executives may develop a quite different outlook from the Thatcherite old guard. Professional competence and financial prudence may be more fashionable than deal-making. In the 1980s consumption and debt was all the rage. In the 1990s investment and innovation may come back into fashion. An acceptance of Britain's place alongside the social market economies of Europe may become more common than fierce national pride and a fascination with the free-market US. A decade ago it may have been fashionable to be dismissively critical of the failings of the public sector and favour privatisation as a cure-all. In this decade governments will want businessmen to bridge the gap between the public and the private. A role model of Majorite businessmen could be Sir James Blyth, the 53-year-old chairman of Boots, who used to be in charge of export sales at the Ministry of Defence and who is helping Mr Major to implement his Citizen's Charter. The new generation of managers will need more than just professional skills. They may also need a different approach to politics. The Thatcherite old guard was politically devout. The new guard will have to be pragmatic, able to deal with socialist commissioners in Brussels and perhaps even a Labour government at home.</p>

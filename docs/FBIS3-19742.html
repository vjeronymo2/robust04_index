The sources said Ocalan had travelled to Lachin earlier this  month from his residence in the town of al-Qardahah in Syria's  Latakia province. The PKK leader had been living for nearly a  decade in Damascus and Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad's hometown  of al-Qardahah.    According to information received by the TDN, [TURKISH DAILY  NEWS] Ocalan is currently in contact both with Armenian  officials and influential Kurdish circles in Lachin.    They said that he aims to establish a major training base in  the Lachin corridor, which connects Nagorno-Karabakh with  Armenia, opened by the Armenians in 1992 and since then the main  artery supplying the enclave from Armenia.    The exact date of Ocalan's travel to Lachin was not made  clear, although it has been confirmed that he was outside Syria  earlier this month when Iraqi Kurdish leader Jalal Talabani  visited that country.    Despite Turkish press reports that Talabani had contacted  Ocalan and was seeking to press him for a new cease-fire,  sources said the PUK [Patriotic Union of Kurdistan] leader--who  also travelled to al-Qardahah--did not find him there. Talabani  has denied the reports saying he had no contact with Ocalan. In  a meeting he held with Turkish gendarmerie commanders last week  near the Iraqi border, Talabani informed Turkey of this as well.    The sources, who usually know of Ocalan's whereabouts, told  the TDN on Thursday [17 March] that there was also speculation  that the PKK leader had recently travelled to Russia.    Once the camp in Lachin is set up, they said, there could be  more terrorist activity in eastern Turkey.    The PKK has in the past denied Ocalan's previous trips  outside Syria.    The PKK's European representative and Ocalan's political  advisor, Kani Yilmaz, said in January that he would even meet  the press but no journalist has seen Ocalan for the past seven  months.</p>

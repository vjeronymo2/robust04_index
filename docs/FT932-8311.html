			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Government Bonds: Size and coupon of next gilt auction well received THE BANK of England's announcement that the next gilt auction would be of Pounds 3bn 7 3/4 per cent stock due 2006 lifted the UK government bond market at the end of the day. The good reception was attributed to the size of the auction - at the bottom end of expectations - and to the comparatively low coupon. A coupon below 8 per cent was taken as a sign of the bank's confidence in a lower inflation outlook. It also meant the gilt would be priced below par, building in a capital gain. The futures contract benefited most, gaining about  3/8 points. In the cash market the auction area and beyond showed small gains. DISAPPOINTMENT that the Bundesbank left the repo rate unchanged at 7.60 per cent caused a sell-off in the German government bond market. The immobility cast a further pall over hopes that it would cut the Lombard or discount rates at its council meeting today, although a few were still looking for a  1/4 reduction. Once the June futures contract fell through 94.45, further sales were triggered. The day's low was 94.26, from which there was some recovery. Expectations of a Yes vote in Denmark also acted as a drag on bunds, which are seen as losing more of their safe haven status. A Yes vote would give another push to the convergence story, activating further switches to higher yielders. The yield spread of 10-year Danish government bonds over bunds would be expected to narrow significantly from yesterday's 71 basis points. French government bonds have continued to benefit from this theme, with the bund-OAT yield spread coming in to as little as 29 basis points. THE ITALIAN government bond market, already attracting demand as a high yielder, rose further on the news that withholding tax would be refunded much more quickly to overseas investors. The 12 1/2 per cent tax, which has taken six months to reclaim, has proved a deterrent to overseas investors. A new target of only two to three weeks was announced by the government, which needs overseas investors to finance the public sector deficit. It also announced spending cuts designed to counteract a looming overshoot on that deficit. The BTP future gained 80 basis points to close near its all time high of 99.56. THE JAPANESE government bond market took fright at a newspaper report that short-term interest rates might rise, exacerbating its concerns about economic recovery. The September futures contract fell through a key support level, opening at 106.44 and closing at 106.11. In the cash market the yield on the benchmark No 145 rose from 4.575 per cent to 4.67 per cent. Once again there was a lack of domestic demand. Other niggling factors were a rise in the overnight money rate to 3 7/32 per cent, the weakening of the yen against the dollar and declines in overseas government bond markets. The US Treasury yield curve continued to flatten yesterday as longer-dated securities posted fresh declines while the short end held its ground. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down at 101 9/32 , yielding 7.018 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was unchanged at 99, to yield 4.026 per cent. The day's only economic news - a 6.7 per cent rise in monthly housing starts  -was largely ignored but prices at the long end eased because attention was focused on the Federal Reserve's policy-making Open Market Committee meeting in Washington DC. Recent news on inflation has heightened speculation that the FOMC might decide to shift the bias of monetary policy towards a possibly tightening. Although such a move would not necessarily involve a hike in interest rates, it would make it more likely that interest rates would go up, rather than stay steady or be lowered, over the coming months.</p>

Israeli forces stationed in the 'Ayn Qinya hills opened  heavy machine-gun fire on Mimis Bridge and the surrounding woods  for 20 minutes at dawn today. They fired flares over the area,  causing fires in groves nearby. The Israeli artillery bombarded  the al- Rayhan woods in the Jazzin area this morning and columns  of smoke could be seen billowing in the area.    Israeli military aircraft overflew the south, concentrating  on al-Nabatiyah and Iqlim al-Tuffah, before midnight.</p>

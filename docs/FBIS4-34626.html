			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Union Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] The executive branch has instructed Fogade [Deposit  Guarantee and Banking Protection Fund] to immediately pay up to  4 million bolivares to depositors of the eight banks intervened  by government decree, in accordance with Article 23 of the  special law protecting depositors and regulating emergencies at  banking institutions.    The measure was adopted at a special Council of Ministers  meeting at Miraflores Palace, where the issue was examined in  barely 10 minutes. The ministers interpreted the text of the  law, according to which it is not possible to wait until the  banks in question are rehabilitated or their debts settled to  return depositors' funds.    The announcement was made by Finance Minister Julio Sosa  Rodriguez, who said the 13-article decree explains the  situation. Sosa has announced the General Bank Superintendency,  Fogade, and the interveners of the eight banks, who were  discussing payment schedules, have already been notified of this  decision.    [Begin Sosa recording] Payment of the 4 million bolivares  will begin, to the extent possible, on 27 June. The depositors  are entitled to 4 million bolivares whether a bank is liquidated  or rehabilitated, and there is no reason to subject them to  delays of up to 30 days, which is how long it takes to make that  decision. There is no reason to subject depositors to that  deadline. [end recording]    Sosa has denied the wave of rumors concerning alleged crises  at other banks. He said such remarks are unfounded and greatly  harm the country. Sosa has urged the Venezuelan people not to  spread such rumors because foreigners, willing to invest in the  country, purchase Venezuelan Government and private  institutions' assets when conditions are good and a good effort  could be wasted.</p>

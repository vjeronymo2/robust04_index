			<p><P> March 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JACK SMITH: DEMOLISHING DECONSTRUCTION BRINGS MORE DEBATE  </P> <P> I continue to be chastised for questioning the validity and value of a vogue  form of literary criticism known as deconstruction.  </P> <P> I do not understand deconstruction, as I admitted; but I infer, from what I  have read, that it reduces texts to ambiguity or meaninglessness. In the end,  the word is master of the man.  </P> <P> It was born in France, but now seems to be entrenched in American higher  education, especially at UC Irvine and Occidental College.  </P> <P> I have already quoted John Rowe, of the Critical Theory Institute at Irvine,  who complained that as a journalist I am no more able to understand  deconstruction than to understand atomic physics or perform laser surgery.  Quite correct.  </P> <P> Similar complaints, though more acerbic, have come from Michael R. Near,  assistant professor of English, and Daniel D. Fineman, associate professor of  English and comparative literary studies, both of Occidental.  </P> <P> Having had my say, I owe my critics a hearing. I hope my necessarily brief  summaries reflect fairly the tone and content of their protests.  </P> <P> Near's is long and detailed. First, he says that my ignorance makes it hard to  take me seriously. But he notes that I would not scorn an astrophysicist  because he could not explain his work to me in a few simple words. "I am  therefore curious that you would feel no compunction about leveling your scorn  at language specialists who could not reduce to a few simple terms the  intricacies of deconstruction."  </P> <P> He said my column was "childish, intellectually irresponsible, and  ideologically dangerous," and perpetuated "the long anti-intellectual tradition  that values the obvious and eschews the difficult enterprise of critical  thinking. . . . And you do it in such an engaging style that we can barely  detect the ideological rot that serves as the foundation for your discussion. .  . ."  </P> <P> (That's not as bad as comparing me to Hitler and Stalin, as another critic  did.)  </P> <P> Prof. Fineman, like Near and Rowe, said that I simply do not have the education  to understand deconstruction. He notes that he has spent 15 years trying to  read Jacques Derrida, its high priest. "His work is very difficult because it  relies on an in-depth knowledge of Western philosophy from Parmenides to  Husserl, a set of theoretical gambits that are at odds with those implicit in  this same Western culture, a use of language that is intentionally metaphoric,  and no desire to lower his rhetorical or discursive 'level' to please an  audience which has not done its 'homework.' "  </P> <P> As if that were not enough to shut me out, he notes that deconstruction can be  thought of as "a humanistic replication of Kurt Godel's Incompleteness Theorem  of 1931." (I admit I am not familiar with that theorem.)  </P> <P> "Now Godel was one of the great mathematicians of the 20th Century, and his  work in foundations and meta-mathematics is universally respected by those who  can understand it. Nonetheless, I suspect that if you 'knock at (his) door,'  you will also find no one who speaks your particularly impoverished version of  English."  </P> <P> I admit my ignorance. I am even more ignorant than the person who wrote the  following plaintive letter, asking to remain anonymous:  </P> <P> "Your essay was a shot in the arm. I am a candidate for an M.A. in English. For  several years now, I have been struggling to understand deconstruction. As of  today, I still haven't a clue as to what it is about. I have been made to feel  inadequate by certain . . . professors because I wasn't able to gush over this  new phenomenon or use its jargon. . . . I am a humble high school English  teacher. The flatulent, self-conscious and pompous deconstruction essays are  the very antithesis of what I have been teaching my students about writing. . .  ."  </P> <P> And this one, also anonymous, from a graduate student in the humanities at UCI,  where Derrida is in residence:  </P> <P> "As a rule, the faculty worships the ground (Derrida) walks on. Your article .  . . only expresses the tip of the iceberg. The real tragedy is the salaries,  perks, grad student favors, secretarial help and free conference time that  these tenured 'researchers' receive while 27 million Americans are illiterate.  . . ."  </P> <P> Have the deconstructionists improved the writing of one novelist or poet, or  made literature any more readable? Does anyone outside the rarefied air of  their ivory towers have the slightest idea what they're talking about?  </P> <P> True, I don't understand the physicists either, but at least they gave us the  atom bomb.  </P></p>

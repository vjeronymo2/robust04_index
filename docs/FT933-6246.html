			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: VAT on flat I AM ABOUT to have some essential repairs done to a flat I own in London, which I occupy occasionally. The managing agents will be responsible for supervising the work and have billed me for their services, including Pounds 254.64 valued-added tax. As a foreigner and non-resident of the UK, am I not entitled to exemption for this VAT charge? My bankers, stockbrokers and other professional advisers who I employ from time to time exclude VAT in their invoices to me. If the agents are correct, would I be entitled to a refund similar to those on goods I buy when in the UK and export personally when departing. If so, where should I submit any claim for the rebate? You are not exempt from VAT on charges relating to your UK property although other services, including those of stockbrokers, are zero rated to non-residents. You can obtain a refund of VAT on goods exported by you. The retailer will give a form to complete which explains the rules. The detailed rules are set out in Customs &amp; Excise notice 704. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

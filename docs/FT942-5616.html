			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / UK Company News: VSEL rises to Pounds 61m but warns on outlook VSEL, the Barrow-based submarine builder, reported a 10 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 55.6m to Pounds 61m for the year to March 31. The company is enjoying peak profitability from the Trident submarine construction contract. The increase, on sales of Pounds 466m (Pounds 442m), was achieved despite a fall in interest income on the company's cash pile to Pounds 10.1m (Pounds 13.9m) due to lower rates. Operating profit increased by 22 per cent from Pounds 41.7m to Pounds 50.9m. However, VSEL's shares lost 50p to 928p after it warned that profits for the current financial year were unlikely to increase significantly. Analysts had been expecting about Pounds 70m this year with the construction of the fourth and final Trident submarine contributing to profits for the first time. Construction of Trident submarines is starting to wind down and the Ministry of Defence is unlikely to award a contract to build the second batch of five Trafalgar class hunter-killer submarines until early 1996. The company insists the remaining Pounds 24m of rationalisation provisions, along with an additional Pounds 4.5m taken last year, will be enough to meet redundancy costs. It is seeking work on surface ships to meet any lull. VSEL is vying with GEC for the important prime contractor status on the Trafalgar order. It is also considering bidding for the Devonport dockyard, which is to be privatised by 1996. Devonport has already secured all the refitting work on the Royal Navy's nuclear submarine fleet which was manufactured by VSEL. The final dividend is increased to 23.5p for a total of 34p (29p) payable on earnings per share of 103.7p (93.4p). COMMENT The destination of VSEL's cash mountain is the central question preoccupying investors. The company says it needs to retain the money in its balance sheet if it is to win its spurs with the Ministry of Defence as a risk-taking prime contractor. Winning prime status on the Trafalgar order would certainly help profitability, but that will defer until 1996 a decision on use of its cash. By then it will have accumulated about Pounds 330m, or 900p a share, which could be returned to shareholders. Equally, a predator may be tempted by the cash before the company acts. Other uses for the money, including merger with a cash-hungry company, or an acquisition spree, look less likely. Still, against that lure, profitability has peaked and the Trafalgar bid is not yet in the bag; other work on surface ships is even less assured. Piling up cash as a virility symbol for the MoD also carries heavy opportunity costs, particularly with interest rates low. VSEL's low rating has always reflected its dependence on a single customer and inflexibility of its product. The strong cash position underpins the shares, but investors looking for the upside will have to hope that management proves as adept at finding new business as it has been at reshaping the company over the past three years.</p>

			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollars rides Clinton switchback THE DOLLAR bounced higher in early European trading but doubts about President Clinton's plans for reducing the US budget deficit left it struggling to break through DM1.6400, write Emma Tucker and Gillian Tett. The market's initial reaction to the president's economic package was favourable and the US currency rose to DM1.6600, but by the European close it had dropped near to DM1.6300. Market worries were fed by White House comments that Mr Clinton hoped to work with the Federal Reserve to keep rates low and that Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, shared that goal. These appeared to outweigh relatively strong inflation and trade data. The December merchandise trade deficit narrowed to Dollars 6.95bn from Dollars 7.35bn and both the headline and core rates of inflation rose by more than expected. Mr Stephen Hannah, economist at IBJ International, said the dollar's volatility stemmed from markedly different reactions to the president's message. 'One camp is highly cynical, and says the budget reductions are based on tax increases rather than lower expenditure,' he said. 'It worries that the expenditure figures will rise once the plans reach Congress, so a high deficit will continue to be generated.' The opposing view, according to Mr Hannah, is that President Clinton is being bold and is dealing with the deficit in the appropriate manner. Mr Avinash Persaud, currency economist at UBS Phill-ips &amp; Drew, believes the president's growth package will trigger fast economic growth this year. 'The key factor is the timing of the fiscal stimulus with respect to his reduction measures. The fiscal stimulus is front end loaded, whereas reduction measures are back end loaded,' Mr Persaud said, pointing out that since Mr Clinton's tax measures would not be introduced until at least the autumn, they would not damp economic growth this year. The dollar closed just over  1/2 pfennig up at DM1.6335. In New York the US currency finished at DM1.6315. Trading in European currencies was quiet. The exchange rate mechanism came under no particular pressure, with poor industrial production figures in France making little impact on the franc. The French currency closed fractionally firmer at FFr3.389 against the D-Mark. The Italian lira continued to fall in spite of the reduction in ERM tensions, suggesting that it is now domestic factors determining the lira's level. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank, said: 'The lira has been very much undermined by worries over the strength of the government coalition.' It ended at L953.4 per D-Mark, compared with L951.1 at the previous close. Sterling stood on the sidelines, largely unmoved by better than expected bank lending and unemployment figures. It gained a pfennig at DM2.3600.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella by </F> Mercedes Korin on advertisements about immigration to Argentina  published in Hong Kong, Russia, the United Kingdom, and Peru;  place and date not given]    [Text] [Korin] Would the Foreign Ministry accept an  agreement with the PRC?    [Petrella] The PRC is growing; its people have a culture  that  values hard work, seriousness, and discipline; and I believe  they can positively contribute to Argentine development.    [Korin] Do many immigrants come to Argentina after reading  advertisements in their country's newspapers?    [Petrella] We are seeking to channel requests for residence  in Argentina through our consulates in Shanghai and Beijing. We  want to prevent this from becoming an activity that is not  controlled by the government because this sort of situation can  lead to abuse, as already has occurred. It recently occurred  with Peru, for example. Our laws do not establish that a person  has to pay to enter Argentina.    [Korin] Do you know of any similar advertisement in Hong  Kong?    [Petrella] Yes, but our consulate in Hong Kong is always  informing everyone that Argentina does not charge anything to  allow people to enter the country, that except for an extremely  small sum for stamps, admittance is free.    [Korin] What about Russia?    [Petrella] I can show you a folder with a list of those who  want to legally come to Argentina.    [Korin] How many people are on this list?    [Petrella] Nearly 15,000, all of them professionals. In  addition, 20,000 Rumanians have asked to come to Argentina.    [Korin] To mention a migration policy contemplating the  admittance of Rumanians to Argentina sounds contradictory  because, so far, no Rumanian has been able to settle here.    [Petrella] The problem is that there has been no agreement  in  this sense. Argentina is studying the situation and reporting on  it to Europeans, thus inviting them to fund the migration  program.    [Korin] Is Korean migration still intense?    [Petrella] Yes, but Korean migration has been dealt with  unofficially; there has been no program for it. The Foreign  Ministry, however, deems it very positive. According to the ROK  Embassy, nearly 80,000 Koreans are living in the federal capital.    [Korin] Most immigrants, however, come from neighboring  countries that are not as developed as those you have mentioned.  What happens to those whom the government believes to have  little "hard-work culture," as you say, and who come from  countries that do not have a strong economy?    [Petrella] They are all hard workers (he laughs). The idea  is  not whether the person is coming here to invest. It is whether  this person will join our working reality and avoid joining  criminals.    [Korin] The government was interested in having East  European immigrants. Now it leaked that it is holding talks with  the PRC. How do these migration projects benefit Argentina?    [Petrella] The country benefits from migration that  generates  services and jobs. They are not entirely destitute and come from  countries that traditionally export capital and technology.  History and previous experiences show that if a society receives  immigrants from countries with a strong economy, part of this  economy comes with the immigrant. This is partially what  occurred with Japanese immigration to southern Brazil. The  immigrants immediately establish links with the mother country  and this is positive. This has occurred in Argentina with  relation to Spain and Italy. Regarding East Europe, while the  other countries offered these countries financial assistance,  Argentina was the only one to offer them the possibility of  absorbing part of the migration that the other European  countries could not absorb. [Foreign Minister] Di Tella said:  "We offer them la pampa, blue skies, and Argentine land."  (Petrella stands up and moves his hands). But we were talking  about people who could support themselves. Argentina is one of  the few countries in the world that still offers this  possibility.    [Korin] Which other countries do?    [Petrella] Australia, New Zealand, Canada -- but to an  increasingly smaller degree. To a certain extent, South Africa  does too.    [Korin] What does a country need to have an open migration  policy?    [Petrella] It needs space. A country with large free  territories must fill them up. Not exactly to fill them up but  to have a more rational occupation of these territories.    [Korin] What are the strictest countries in this regard?    [Petrella] The European ones. They have even signed an  agreement to create a common border alround Europe and thus  limit the number of possible immigrants. Some even say this  agreement harms the asylum right that was so traditional in  countries such as Spain and France. The United States is strict  but has signed agreements and, in general, is a very generous  country.    [Korin] But not only in regard to the space issue.    [Petrella] Ask them about that.    [Korin] How can we combine the concept that empty  territories  must be filled up with the concept some people have that  immigrants occupy positions that should be occupied by  Argentines?    [Petrella] The thing is as follows: The arrival of people  with a certain purchasing power creates jobs and services. They  do not occupy other people's positions. It all depends on the  immigrant's social and economic level. None of those listed in  this folder (points out the list of Russians) comes  empty-handed. I also would like to explain that I bluntly reject  the concept that there is xenophobia in Argentina. We can say  that we have job problems, competition problems, labor law  flexibility problems. Our problems in this field are related to  labor and not to a xenophobe attitude.    [Korin] I am referring to immigrants from neighboring  countries who come to Argentina without this standard of living.  Are agreements to be signed with neighboring countries being  analyzed?    [Petrella] No, we are holding permanent talks with these  countries because most of those who immigrate to Argentina come  from neighboring countries. Border control is not as strict as  it should be. Sometimes a person enters the country as a student  without being one. Perhaps, Argentine laws are too flexible. To  enter the United States a person must prove that he or she has  been accepted by a university, in addition to several other  things.    [Korin] Why have 400,000 immigrants failed to make their  situation legal even after the Argentine Government granted them  15 months of amnesty?    [Petrella] People are usually afraid of legalizing their  situation. This is a widespread sociological phenomenon, similar  to the one responsible for people's refusal to pay the value  added tax, or freelance workers' refusal to register in the  social security system. People tend to distrust the government.  Deep inside, there is a cultural distrust about the solidity and  fairness of our governmental institutions. This is the only way  we can explain why a person chooses to live in an irregular  situation.</p>

An opinion poll  taken by the National Agricultural Cooperative Federation toward  2,000 farmers at the end of last year showed on Monday that 35.1  percent of the respondents said they would reduce their farming  scale to a point where they could obtain food grains of their  own need only. On the other hand, 45.1 percent replied they  would continue to engage in farming as now even after the  Uruguay Round agreement.    Those who said they would give up farming altogether  accounted for 9.2 percent of the total and 10.5 percent said  they would delegate their farmlands to some ones else. Those who  said they would abandon farming were mostly those with tiny  farmlands. Those with relatively large farmland areas said they  would continue farming.    Regarding the issue of whether to allow non-farmers to  possess farmlands, 54.1 percent favored non-farmers' possession  in the interests of the buildup of farming competitiveness. But,  30.7 percent of the questioned said they were against it because  it runs counter to the traditional principle of "farmlands for  farmers."</p>

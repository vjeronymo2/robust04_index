			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / N-waste row to be taken to court The decade-old quandary over what to do with the US's nuclear waste has erupted into legal controversy. A coalition of utilities and state power regulators has filed a suit accusing the federal Department of Energy of defaulting on its promise to take spent fuel. The suit contends that the Energy Department has collected nearly Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.5bn) in fees from nuclear power generators under the 1982 Nuclear Waste Policy Act, but is now backing off the act's requirement that it start collecting spent nuclear fuel in 1998. The Energy Department said the suit was 'unfortunate, since we are in the middle of a formal public process to address these concerns'. The search for a permanent nuclear waste dump has dragged on for years with little discernible progress, and the energy department says its proposed central waste dump at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, will not be ready until 2010 at the earliest. Under the 1982 law and additional legislation passed in 1987, the federal government would have to pay Nevada for accepting the spent fuel at Yucca Mountain, but Nevada would in turn have to give up its right to veto the site, which it has not done. But many nuclear power plants, which were built with limited storage facilities on the assumption that their spent fuel would be reprocessed or stored elsewhere, are fast running out of room. The Nuclear Energy Institute, an industry grouping, estimates that 23 plants will have run out of spent fuel storage space by 1998, when the act foresaw that the federal government would take over the responsibility for this highly radioactive waste. Ms Hazel O'Leary, energy secretary, argued last year that the federal government was not obliged to take the spent fuel if it had no central depository.</p>

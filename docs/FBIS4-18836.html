			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, April 11 (AFP) -- France tackled China over  human rights during a visit by French Premier Edouard Balladur,  his Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said on radio here Monday [11  April].    Speaking on Europe 1, Juppe said France had discussed with  the Chinese authorities "our conception of human rights" and  "how we considered that from this point of view the situation in  China was unsatisfactory."    Questioned about the arrests of a number of dissidents  during  the Balladur visit, Juppe said that there had been  "disinformation" surrounding the affair, noting that a Chinese  minister had denied the arrests while "the New China News Agency  had confirmed them in a dispatch."    The French minister said the aim of the trip, "to renew  political dialogue with China," had been achieved.    Paris was willing to cooperate with Taiwan, said Juppe, but  added that China needed telephone lines, nuclear power stations,  high- speed trains and wheat.    "It is with this in mind that we also renewed dialogue,"  said  Juppe.    Normal relations between Paris and Beijing were restored on  January 12 when Paris pledged not to conclude any new arms  contracts with Taiwan, healing a year-long rift.    Relations had become strained after a contract for the sale  of 60 advanced Mirage 2000-5 bombers to Taiwan, followed up by  the sale of gunboats.</p>

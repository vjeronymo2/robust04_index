			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Technology: Cut-price ways with training videos - Worth Watching Expensive in-house training videos have been one of the first casualties of recessionary cuts. Now a desk-top editing system could reinstate videos at considerably less expense. Developed in the US, Media Suite Pro, from Avid Technology, works on an Apple PC. The recorded film is digitised and transferred from the tape on to a two-gigabyte disc, which can store up to 40 minutes of footage. Using a mouse, the film editor can splice images together and add music or sound using the computer keyboard. A package including Apple Mac, disc drive and VCR costs Pounds 17,000.

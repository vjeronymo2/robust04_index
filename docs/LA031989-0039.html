			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN DEFENSE OF A 'HOMEMAKER FROM THE MIDWEST'  </P> <P> Kudos to Rakolta for her stand against "Married" and other offensive television  programming. I don't know how she watched the show for seven weeks (according  to a Times article). I have seen one episode of "Married," and that was enough  for me. Inane, repulsive and downright boring.  </P> <P> BRENDA HESTER  </P> <P> Garden Grove  </P></p>

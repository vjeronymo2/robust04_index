			<p><P> May 19, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WESTLAKE AWAKENS IN TIME TO AVOID 1ST-ROUND UPSET  </P> <P> Westlake High's stingy pitching, consistent defense, and pesky hitting were but  a memory to the Warriors for the better part of their Southern Section 5-A  Division playoff game against Mira Costa on Friday.  </P> <P> But, as they seemingly have done all year when their backs are pinned against a  dugout, the Warriors (26-1) came up with the key ingredients in time to hand  Mira Costa (13-14) a 6-5 loss in a first-round game. Westlake will meet  Torrance, a 10-7 winner over Edison, on Tuesday at a site to be determined by a  coin flip today.  </P> <P> Westlake, which looked like anything but the top-seeded team, trailed, 4-1,  after three innings. Its defense -- which committed seven errors -- offered  little support for ace Mike Eby and the Warrior offense struggled with Jason  Garner's slow curve.  </P> <P> "It was sloppy. Very, very sloppy," Coach Rich Herrera said. "We played worse  than we've played all season."  </P> <P> Herrera, who nervously stalked the third-base foul line and vehemently argued  with umpires, was spared his sanity by a frenzied Westlake comeback.  </P> <P> Westlake tied the score, 4-4, in the fifth on Greg Hess' solo home run, his  seventh. Todd Preston, who entered the game with a .190 batting average, drove  in the go-ahead run with a ground-rule double in the sixth. The final run,  which proved to be the difference, scored on a pickoff attempt.  </P> <P> "We were fortunate to keep coming back," Herrera said. "When you're down, 4-1,  a lot of things run through your mind."  </P> <P> Herrera's thoughts were churning from the start, when Mira Costa -- the No. 3  team from the Ocean League -- scored three times in the first two innings.  Preston committed errors on the game's first two ground balls, which led to two  unearned runs in the first.  </P> <P> Mira Costa added a run in the second on Cody Beason's second homer of the  season. Westlake countered with a run in the second on Rick Wolters'  run-scoring double, and Mira Costa extended its lead to 4-1 on Bobby  Dominguez's RBI grounder in the fourth.  </P> <P> Eby (10-0), a senior left-hander who entered the game with a 1.37 earned-run  average, allowed only five hits but walked six.  </P> <P> "Mike didn't pitch well at all, and he knows that," Herrera said.  </P> <P> Westlake cut its deficit to 4-3 with two runs in the fourth on Wolters'  run-scoring double and an error that allowed Wolters to score. Wolters, a  senior second baseman, also saved a run in the fourth when he backhanded a  ground ball headed for center field and recorded a force out at second.  </P> <P> After Hess led off the fifth with his game-tying homer, Westlake -- which blew  a bases-loaded, no-out situation in the inning -- scored twice in the sixth.  Mike Lieberthal doubled, Hess was intentionally walked, and Preston followed  with a ground-rule double off the hill in right field. On Dave Monheim's  groundout, Mira Costa first baseman Shawn Wright attempted to throw Preston out  as he rounded second and Hess scored from third.  </P> <P> Eby pitched out of a bases-loaded jam in the sixth. In the seventh, a walk and  an error put the tying runs on with none out. Beason hit a double-play grounder  to Falsken at short, but Wolters' relay bounced past Hess at first and allowed  Dominguez to score. Hess retrieved the ball and nabbed Beason in a rundown for  the second out, and Eby struck out Jeff Diussa to end the game.  </P></p>

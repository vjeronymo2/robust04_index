			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, June 8, IRNA -- A morning daily here  Wednesday editorialized on the new pricing scheme saying that  the plan will be successful if it is implemented with the least  degree of government interference and if the consumers  themselves perform the role of the controllers. The compulsory  use of price tags on articles is an effective way of bringing  some order in the market and it is being used for this purpose  all over the world, TEHRAN TIMES wrote.    The doubtful aspects of the present government scheme begin  at the stage where the government apparently intends to assume  an active role in determining prices, the daily said adding that  this part of the scheme seems to be its least practicable  aspect. As long as we have not reached a balanced economy and  our production and distribution systems have not evolved into a  coherent network, the practice of requiring producers to observe  constant prices for any length of time would have very little  chance of success, the article stressed.    It further noted that another aspect of the scheme which  deserves close examination is the supervisory role assigned to  the Commerce Ministry and in particular to the association of  guilds and is obviously in conflict with the role assigned to  the consumers in the same scheme.    In a guided free market economy such as now prevails in our  society, the use of price tags could be useful only in  regulating the market and enforces some sort of uniformity of  prices in various part of a single city, the article said. But  when the government decides to have an active role in  determining prices, then the scheme will meet overt and hidden  resistance from producers and distributors, it added. It  concluded by saying that for this reason it is doubtful whether  direct government role in price determination can produce any  beneficial results for the economy.</p>

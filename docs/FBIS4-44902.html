			<p>CSO     [Text] The space industry has always been fully cooperative  with the government in space development, which is considered a  national project. The phrase, "A new step in space operations,"  which was used by the National Space Development Agency of Japan  (NASDA) to describe the success of the launch of the H-2, can be  applied to the very situation the Japanese space industry is in.  The market size of the Japanese space industry is a mere  &yen;200 billion or so as of FY92. Moreover, the demand comes  mostly from the government and is nowhere near the market size  in other leading countries. There are many aspects that are  beyond the capabilities of private companies, e.g., any given  project requires an immense investment of funds, long lead time,  and a huge risk. Despite those seemingly insurmountable  problems, Japan has made a giant step forward into the space  business.    One top executive of the industry said this: "The H-2 launch  vehicle was built on the premise that it will be developed on  domestic technology only, in order to meet the large satellite  launch needs expected in the 1990s. With this success, it is  possible that other countries might want to use this vehicle to  launch their satellites, in addition to various Japanese  satellites scheduled to be launched. The higher the demand, the  more improvements that will result in the technology to reduce  the cost; and the lower the cost becomes, the higher the demand  will be.    "They hope that the H-2 will fulfil those expectations. In  that sense, the successful launch may be said to have opened the  first year of the space age for Japan, or a milestone of the  Japanese space industry, with the vistas of the coming 21st  century, and it is the cornerstone of future development."    The point here is that the wider the space business field  expands, the better the chances for business development. A  launch vehicle consists of about 100,000 components. The people  of the companies, as well as NASDA, who were involved in the  design and manufacture of those components did everything they  could to ensure reliability, including extensive process  evaluations and process witness tests and source checks during  the entire manufacturing process, ranging from the quality  control of each component to the entire system integration. All  those efforts culminated in the successful launch.    Some of the companies involved in the development are as  follows: the fuselage was developed by Mitsubishi Heavy  Industries (MHI) as the principal contractor; the engines, by  Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries (IHI), as well as MHI; the  satellite fairing, by Kawasaki Heavy Industries (IHI); the solid  rocket motor, by Nissan Motors; and the onboard electronics, by  NEC, Mitsubishi Electric, Nippon Avionics, and Mitsubishi  Precision.    The ground facilities that include the launch site  equipment,  communication and radio systems, and launch control were  completed through the concerted efforts of MHI, IHI, and KHI, as  well as Oki Electric, NEC, and Toshiba.    Most of the companies mentioned above participated in the  development of the two space test devices and systems carried by  this first H-2 launch vehicle. One of the two test systems  mentioned here is the Orbit Reentry Experiment (OREX) equipment.  That experiment is intended for the development of the Japanese  version of the space shuttle, HOPE, which is expected to be  launched in the early part of the 21st century. The objectives  of the experiment are to test whether it can withstand the high  heat that is created during the reentry into the atmosphere and  to collect the data for the black-out period, during which the  radio signal cannot reach the ground, because of the enormously  high temperatures.    MHI assumed the responsibility of principal contractor,  working with six other suppliers.    Another test device is the H-2 Vehicle Evaluation Payload  (VEP). VEP was launched with the OREX atop the H-2, after which  it was separated and injected into an elliptical orbit with an  inclination of about 28.8 degrees, with an apogee altitude of  about 36,300 km and a perigee altitude of about 450 km.    It stayed in orbit for about 100 hours, during which time it  conducted various analyses such as the evaluation of the  accuracy of the satellite orbit injection by the launch vehicle  and the environmental conditions for various pieces of equipment  during the launch. VEP was developed jointly by Toshiba and IHI.    Although it is a national project, each company worked hard  individually to live up to the full responsibility and  credibility bestowed on it. Following the H-2's first launch, a  hoard of satellites -- including the Geostationary  Meteorological Satellite-5 (GMS-5), the Space Flyer Unit (SFU)  and the Advance Earth Observing Satellite (ADEOS) -- are waiting  to be launched by the H-2, and those satellites are nearing  completion with the enthusiastic cooperation of all the  companies involved. The H-2 provides quite an attractive  opportunity in terms of economic value, as well as in terms of  its large size and its ability to launch multiple satellites.    The environment of the space industry is a rocky road, to  say  the least. Although it is a promising frontier for mankind, the  enormous funds required are blocking the approach. It is an  undeniable truth that space development is stagnant at the  moment. Every other country involved -- not just Japan -- is  having difficulty assembling a large budget for space activities.    The United States has developed a detailed policy on  commercialization in five fields -- i.e., launch services,  satellite communications, satellite-based remote sensing, new  materials manufacturing and processing that utilize the space  environment, and industrial infrastructure in orbit -- to  promote the commercialization in general. In Europe as well,  commercialization is being considered mainly in the areas of  launch services and remote sensing.    Russia is offering opportunities for the performance of  experiments in the space environment on the space station Mir  and its module Photon, while China has established an agency for  offering launch services. In both countries, the trend seems to  be to shift from the government-led systems to the  government/industry- or industry-led systems.    The Japanese space industry has become competitive with  those  countries in its success in launching a large vehicle. A  significant jump is expected in the next step. In order to  respond to the needs of the industry, the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry has begun a study of the  commercialization of the space development industry.    The Space Activities Commission of the Prime Minister's  Office recently established a forum to prepare for the reform of  the Outline of Space Development Policy scheduled to be  implemented later this year. It is certain that the nation's  eyes will focus again on how further progress can be achieved in  space development through a concerted effort by the academic,  industrial, and government circles in the wake of this  successful launch of the H-2.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The situation remains very tense in Bosnia.  [passage omitted] Several hundred blue helmets, including many  French soldiers, are still prisoners of the Bosnian Serbs. The  French Foreign Ministry has said that it could not accept that  UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] should be taken hostage.  [passage omitted] A moment ago in Madrid, the UN secretary  general said he would not hesitate to order new air strikes:    [Begin Butrus-Ghali recording, in French] We will go through  to the end concerning the use of air power in former Yugoslavia.  If we need air support, we will not hesitate to call on NATO to  use force to protect the United Nations forces. This is a very  clear warning which I would like to send from here in Madrid to  those elements in Yugoslavia that are trying to oppose the  action of the United Nations. The United Nations will not give  in to any blackmail. The United Nations represents the  international community and represents the will of the  international community. If the international community decides  to use force, the United Nations will decide to use force. In  any case, the use of force must be decided taking account of the  situation on the ground. The soldiers that we have on the  ground advise us how, where, and when force should be used. [end  recording]</p>

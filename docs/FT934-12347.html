			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Pensioners and their needs will not go away Sir, John Willman ('Welfare versus wealth of nations', October 25) is right to identify the challenge to policymakers of an ageing population. But he seems to have fallen into the same trap as many governments, which think washing their hands of the problem - by reducing state provision - will mean it goes away. Pensioners will still be there, even if they do not all appear on government accounts. I am agnostic on the public/private divide. Ends are more important than means. Pension provision should be efficient, equitable, comprehensive and secure, and whichever mechanisms serve these objectives best should be employed. But, whatever their role in terms of actual provision, governments must ensure these objectives are met. New mechanisms are to be encouraged. Abandoning the principle of public responsibility is not.

			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Hurd admits he illegally endorsed Pergau aid Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, yesterday acknowledged that he had illegally endorsed an aid donation of Pounds 216m to help build Malaysia's Pergau dam, but refused to apologise in the Commons. In a statement to MPs, Mr Hurd said he would not appeal against a recent High Court judgment that the Pergau project was 'economically unsound' and that his endorsement of the donation in 1991 had broken British legislation on overseas aid. He also revealed that three other contracts signed under Britain's Aid and Trade Provision in the past eight years could be deemed illegal given the judgment. These were a contract for the Ankara metro in Turkey worth Pounds 22m, a Pounds 2.3m television studio project in Indonesia and a Pounds 2.9m contract for flight information facilities in Botswana. Facing repeated demands from opposition benches for his resignation, Mr Hurd said future payments for Pergau would come directly out of Treasury reserves and not the Overseas Development Administration's budget. He also said that the Pounds 48m which the government must pay to Malaysia for the project in 1994-95 and 1995-96 would not be matched by commensurate cuts in ODA funding. This would give the department a surplus to allocate to other projects. Outstanding payments for the other three projects will also come from Treasury reserves to ensure that they fall within the remit of the Overseas Development and Co-operation Act 1980. The necessary supplementary estimates are to be laid before parliament. But Mr Hurd angered Labour MPs when he said the Pounds 24m which the ODA had spent on Pergau in previous financial years would not be restored to the department. Sir David Steel, former Liberal leader, who has taken a close interest in the affair, attacked Mr Hurd. 'What is self-evident to the taxpayer is that this money was misused,' he said. 'The taxpayer believes that the limited budget for overseas aid should be used for the proper purpose, and you should reinstate those funds.' But Mr Hurd also left open the possibility that the ODA budget would suffer a serious cut after 1996-97, when the Treasury will have another Pounds 122m to pay to the Malaysian authorities. Mr Hurd said that the size of the ODA budget in those years would have to be set in forthcoming public expenditure rounds. But Treasury officials could seek drastic reductions in ODA spending in those years to make up for the increased expenditure incurred by their own contingency fund. During angry exchanges in the Commons, Mr Hurd refused repeated invitations from opposition MPs to give a public apology over the issue. Instead, he insisted that Baroness Thatcher, the former prime minister, had made a commitment that could not be broken. 'I do not feel penitent at taking a fairly robust view of where the interests of this country lie,' he said. However, Sir David Steel accused Mr Hurd and Lady Thatcher of having 'steamrollered' the ODA into the Pergau project. Mr Hurd said that activities financed by the ODA were 'not in general vulnerable to the kind of legal challenge brought in the case of Pergau'.</p>

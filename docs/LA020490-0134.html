			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> N. HOLLYWOOD RETIREMENT HOME EVACUATED BY FIRE;  </P> <P> ARSON: RESIDENTS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD BELIEVE THE BLAZE IS THE LATEST IN A  SERIES OF ARSONS IN THE AREA.  </P> <P> About 65 residents of a North Hollywood retirement home were evacuated early  Saturday after an apparent arson fire broke out in a storage area.  </P> <P> Neighbors said the fire is the latest in a series of blazes set intentionally  in the area.  </P> <P> There were no injuries in the fire, which was started about 4:25 a.m. in an  unlocked storage area of the Royal Bellingham home at 12229 Chandler Blvd.  </P> <P> The fire activated automatic sprinklers, and firefighters were able to put the  blaze out within minutes, said Greg Acevedo of the Los Angeles Fire Department.  </P> <P> Blowers set up by the Fire Department cleared the building of smoke in about 45  minutes. Many of the home's 66 residents went back to bed.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, the fire worried residents of the neighborhood around Bellingham  Avenue and Chandler Boulevard, which has been plagued by arson fires in recent  weeks.  </P> <P> "It's a scary thing because there have been so many fires around here," said  Theresa Carnese, assistant administrator of the retirement home.  </P> <P> An arson investigator said, "We are aware of the fires and they are under  investigation." He would not elaborate, nor would he say whether the fires were  related to a recent rash of similar blazes in the Reseda-Northridge area. Many  of those fires broke out in rubbish bins and storage areas, as did many of the  North Hollywood blazes.  </P> <P> Residents of the area have formed a Neighborhood Watch group, led by Stephanie  Tapper, a free-lance artist and writer. Tapper said she was compelled to act  after an arsonist set two fires in the garage of her apartment building on the  same night.  </P> <P> "It became fairly clear to me that we had something going on here that was not  the norm," she said.  </P></p>

The offer - 9 shares and Pounds 32.50 cash for every 25 Lerose shares - values the latter at about 190p per share, a premium of some 30 per cent over Tuesday's close of 146p.

Country Casuals, floated in June 1992, increased pre-tax profits 28 per cent to Pounds 2.58m for the year to January 23 by focusing on undiscounted sales. This policy resulted in turnover slightly down to Pounds 34.8m (Pounds 36m) together with 'a significant increase in margins'. Earnings per share increased 10 per cent to 10.64p. House of Lerose designs and wholesales women's wear brands, with a manufacturing side including fabric printing and garments.

'Lerose has substantial assets, a Pounds 9.3m cash flow, and complementary brands with considerable potential' said Mr John Shannon, executive chairman of Country Casuals.

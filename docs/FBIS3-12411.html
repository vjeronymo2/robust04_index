			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The U.S. President Is Ignoring the Depth of </F> Our Wound"]    [Text] The tragedy that befell us after the settlers,  through the hands of the criminal doctor Barukh Goldstein,  slaughtered more than 60 of our people's sons at prayer Friday  morning at the Ibrahimi Mosque continues to weigh on the  conscience of each of us. The criminal's timing coincided with  Muslim prayer ceremonies. This increases the anger and the  feeling of bitterness and pain. Despite this, President Clinton  has called on us to exercise restraint. This means that we  should bow our heads and accept these shameful crimes.    Despite our people's ordeal, U.S. President Clinton  announced  that he was inviting Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin to come to Washington to  complete the talks on the agreements. He did this while our  blood, which flowed at the Ibrahimi Mosque, was still warm. He  does not realize the extent of the hatred this sort of massacre  causes. We would have liked President Clinton to say that he  opposes the settlers' impudence; that Israel, if it desires the  establishment of a just peace, should put an end to settlement  activity and the settlers' practices; and that he condemns their  attempts to wreck the chance for peace. Does President Clinton  wish to continue the policy of his predecessor, President Bush,  in humiliating our nation and imposing hegemony over its future?    We ask President Clinton: What would have been Israel's and  the United States' position if it were the Palestinians who  perpetrated such gross violence against the Israelis? We recall  that when some Palestinians tried to carry out an operation on  the shores of Tel Aviv during President Bush's term, there was a  worldwide uproar and the President adopted the unfair decision  to suspend the dialogue with the PLO, which was followed by  other measures. Our people have always been against violence  aimed at innocent persons, regardless of its source. We reject  the fact that President Clinton spoke in such a manner and  blamed only the criminal who perpetrated this barbaric act. The  massacre has deeper dimensions. In Qiryat Arba', the settlement  built on the outskirts of Hebron, hatred and violence against  Palestinians is fomented. What the criminal Goldstein did was  no more than a translation of what those malicious people harbor  in their minds. If it is not possible to evacuate them from  Palestinian lands, they must at least be punished by preventing  them from entering Hebron, especially the Ibrahimi Mosque, which  they have defiled by their act.    We are addressing President Clinton not only because he  sponsors the peace process and oversees the Palestinian-Israeli  accord, but because the criminal came from the United States.  He is of U.S. origin. Many of the settlers who have committed  crimes against our people came from the United States. They are  fanatic adherents of extremism and racism who cover their crimes  with Israeli garb.    As for the Palestinian-Israeli talks and the sincere  Palestinian aspiration for a just peace and a settlement based  on international legitimacy, this has been met by the United  States or Israel by obvious foot-dragging and a policy based on  maneuvering and on gambling on the Arabs' current situation.  President Clinton must realize that it is folly to bet on this  state continuing. Our nation's despair, its sense of  humiliation, and the scorn with which our causes are addressed  can lead to explosions that will be difficult to control. What  is taking place today on the land of Palestine will put matters  back at square one.    Needless to say, it will be difficult to discuss President  Clinton's invitation to resume the talks in Washington on the  presidential level unless the issue of the settlements and the  settlers is addressed. The failure of the Israeli settlement  policy on Palestinian lands has been proven. Israel must  address this issue and defuse the situation before it blows up.  U.S. invitations are tantamount to entertaining futile hopes,  devoid of reality. All peace initiatives and efforts and  peaceful invitations will be of no benefit unless they are  accompanied by urgent action to end the violence and extremism  practiced by the settlers against our people.</p>

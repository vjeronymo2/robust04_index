			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Public pay arithmetic The British government was right yesterday to accept the recommendations of pay review bodies covering teachers, nurses, doctors, the armed forces and top public officials. A decision to override the recommendations for a second year in a row would have fatally undermined the independent pay review system. This has been valuable in depoliticising the setting of pay rates for over 1.5m workers who account for about a third of all public-sector staff. Moreover the pay increases, which are mostly in the 2.75 per cent to 3 per cent range, seem a reasonable compromise between employer and employee interests. The rises are certainly greater than ministers would have liked. But they are also less than the employees were seeking. Once April's tax increases bite, affected workers will still be worse off in real terms. It was also good to see the review bodies inching in the direction of more decentralised pay-setting. Pay should be set by reference to the balance between supply and demand in local labour markets. Much more needs to be done on this score. In a sense, though, accepting the recommendations was the easy part of the government's task. Now comes the hard part: squaring the pay increases with the government's stated policy of freezing the public sector pay bill in cash terms. The government has been consistently mealy-mouthed about what this policy means since it was announced last September and extended from a one-year to a three-year freeze in November's Budget. In particular, ministers have sought to give the impression that provided people work hard and improve their productivity, not only will pay rise but there will be no need to cut jobs. Simple arithmetic Greater productivity is desirable. But it is irrelevant to the government's policy of a pay bill freeze. If pay increases by 3 per cent, then the number of employees must also fall by a broadly similar amount for the pay bill to stay unchanged. This is a matter of simple arithmetic. Not surprisingly, government officials have recently been retreating from the idea of a pay bill freeze, though the policy switch has not been spelt out. The current approach appears to be that it is government departments' overall running costs, not their pay bills, that will be frozen. This means in theory that cost savings achieved outside the pay bill could be used to increase pay and maintain staffing levels. However, given that pay typically accounts for about two-thirds of running costs, job cuts seem unavoidable. There are several directions in which ministers might be tempted to avoid this conclusion. But none is appealing. Future troubles First, the government could bear down particularly hard on the wages of those workers not covered by pay review bodies. Not only would this be unfair. It would also store up troubles for the future, as employees sought to catch up on pay rises they missed this year. The macroeconomic consequences could be wage pressures just at the wrong time in the business cycle. Second, ministers could abandon their policy of freezing running costs/pay bills. But this would mean either easing up on the battle to control the public-sector deficit or raising yet more taxes. Neither is an attractive option. That leaves job cuts as the main way of increasing pay rates while freezing pay bills or departmental running costs. Perhaps that has been ministers' secret agenda all along. Certainly, it is the most credible course of action given the gaping budget deficit and the need to maintain confidence in the review bodies. The trade unions and the Labour party will not, of course, see things that way. They say job cuts will lead to cuts in public services and/or a deterioration in quality. But this is defeatist. The public sector is already achieving improvements in productivity. The record of the privatised industries, where jobs have been cut in large numbers while service standards have improved, is a dramatic pointer to what can be attained. The challenge for ministers must be to achieve similar improvements in the public sector.</p>

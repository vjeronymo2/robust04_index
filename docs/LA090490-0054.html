			<p><P> September 4, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CSUN WASTES CHANCES IN SOCCER LOSS TO UCSB  </P> <P> There was no shortage of opportunities for the Cal State Northridge soccer team  Monday night and the Matadors have no one to blame but themselves for a 2-0  loss to visiting UC Santa Barbara.  </P> <P> CSUN enjoyed a 9-1 corner-kick advantage and an 11-9 edge in shots on goal, but  still came up short.  </P> <P> "We gotta go back (to practice) and work hard on finishing and playing better  within 30 yards of the net," CSUN coach Marwan Ass'ad said. "They should be the  ones who are nervous when we get the ball within 30 yards."  </P> <P> UCSB scored its first goal 18 minutes 45 seconds into the match after a series  of quick passes allowed Mark Johnson to move into shooting range.  </P> <P> Francois DeJohn started the play with an indirect foul kick from 25 yards.  Garrett Schwartz attempted to head the ball into the net, but his attempt  landed at the feet of Johnson, who drilled it in from 10 yards away.  </P> <P> "It is our responsibility to clear it the first time," CSUN junior Scott Piri  said. "We have to be more physical. Once the ball was bouncing around in there  like a pinball it created an opportunity for them."  </P> <P> With the goal in hand, UCSB Coach Cliff Draeger ordered his troops to sit on  the lead.  </P> <P> "They put just about everybody back in the penalty area," Piri said. "So many  times, I'd turn around and they were all in front of me. If we got that one  goal to tie it, it would have changed the game."  </P> <P> The Matadors had several chances, the best of which came 60:41 into the match  when Piri, the team's top returning scorer, dribbled around two Gaucho  defenders and unleashed a high shot from the left corner, 12 yards from the  goal. But goalkeeper Ryan Sparre thwarted the effort, using all of his 6-foot-3  height to make a leaping save.  </P> <P> Four minutes later, the Matadors threatened again when freshman Armando  Valdivia broke loose with only the ball to run down and Sparre to beat. But  Sparre won, reaching the ball first.  </P> <P> Immediately, Northridge launched another attack as Gus Cardenas found teammate  Ronnie Simpson behind the Gaucho defense. But Cardenas' pass was just beyond  Simpon's reach.  </P> <P> In the 73rd minute, Cardenas was knocked down in front of the goal and was  awarded an indirect goal kick. But his shot, around a wall of eight UCSB  players, was wide of the net.  </P> <P> Eventually, the gambles CSUN wagered on offense, along with a leg injury  suffered by defensive anchor Ed Burns, took its toll on defense, and with 6:50  remaining in the match, UCSB scored again.  </P> <P> Vince Thomas of Ventura did the honors, scoring on a rebound.  </P></p>

			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Arts: Live from Prague - Radio Last week's expeditionary force of Radio 3 programmes for a Prague Weekend looked like another foolhardy chapter in the traditionally ambivalent Anglo-Czech history. Previous weekends of live R3 broadcasts have come from Berlin and Minneapolis-St Paul - the twin cities that are home to American public broadcasting. The main presenter, John Tusa, explains there is no set formula, but the choice of the Czech capital at the height of the Prague Spring was inspired. Any reference to the city must turn into a drooling travelogue. Gothic, medieval, baroque, shameless peacock Art Nouveau - the views ambush you down every cobbled street. A blind soprano in the Old Town busks Mozart arias to an orchestra on cassette. The accordionist on Charles Bridge plays a selection from Figaro. Besides the almost excessive musicality that the historian Dr Burney noted two centuries ago, this is the city of Kafka and Schweik, black humour and the unexpected hopefulness that results from the Czech funambulistic mastery of the narrow line between cheerful scepticism and mere cynicism. The balance is delicate, especially in the current economic climate. In a familiar scenario the arts are subjected to cuts, but even here reaction is calm. It is accepted that generous subsidy was for too long not matched by scrutiny. 'The attitude is 'It was nice while we had it but it couldn't last',' says John Tusa. Every inch the BBC man, Tusa is actually Czech-born, transplanted to Britain at the age of three. He is sceptical about the claim that the city is the equivalent of Paris in the 1920s. At midnight the medieval cobbles of Charles Bridge are crowded with young people singing, playing guitars, necking. Nepal in the 1960s might be a better analogy. The Radio 3 schedule goes joyously to town in all senses: music, literature, plays, architecture, politics, late night jazz, even food (well, the ubiquitous dumpling) mean co-operation between different departments: drama, features, talks. Their host is Radio Vltava, a name originally given to a hated East German station that supported the Communist regime. 'Each sentence they broadcast was lies,' beams Boris Kobrle, the bulky, boyish editor in chief of Radio 3's Czech equivalent. But the title is so resonant of national pride, the name of the great river on which the capital stands, immortalised by Smetana's best-loved tone poem, that it easily shakes off the slur. Vltava's output is 65 per cent music, with three or four radio dramas per week, and 15 to 20 minutes of poetry daily (more at weekends) with an average of two serialised readings and a short story a day. They are impressed by the BBC's features, a genre they decide to take up. It seems to be taken for granted that as a cultural station Vltava is economically safe, though a tiny proportion of advertising is now taken by Czech Radio. On Saturday morning nearly 20 people crowd into the control room to share the count-down with presenters John Tusa and Francine Stock through the glass panel. For the next 40 hours, the visiting shift workers sail through without technical mishaps. The back-up tapes in London, intended to plug the gap should the line go down, are never needed. Smetana's opera Dalibor comes live from the National Theatre where a group of British tourists recognise the amiable Controller of Radio 3 and grumble loudly among themselves about recent changes. Chamber concerts have been recorded in some of the noble palaces that bespeak Prague's imperial past, and coming up is the Havel-Prince Charles concert with Solti and Dame Kiri on June 4, to be broadcast live on both BBC2 and Radio 3. At one in the morning on Monday, the last programme starts, a live Anglo-Czech discussion which Radio Vltava takes whole and untranslated. Mercifully, perhaps, not many locals can have heard the conductor Libor Pesek assert that Liverpool and Prague were quite similar really. Half an hour later Radio 3 closes down. Relief, exhaustion and triumph are to be expected, but there's something else. 'We broke every rule in the book,' says one producer, proceeding with a catchphrase I've heard before: 'We're business units, meant to compete against one another but we've brought it off.' The reference to the new philosophy prompts some sardonic mirth amongst the assembled business units. There's a whiff of velvet revolution in the air.</p>

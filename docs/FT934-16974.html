			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Hunger bites in squabbling Serbia: Laura Silber finds a country groaning under international economic sanctions IN AN ATTEMPT to prevent the total collapse of the Serbian economy, President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia is desperately seeking an end to sanctions. He is faced by much deprivation and has shown himself ready to fulfil UN conditions for an end to Serbia's economic isolation, in spite of an earlier vow that sanctions would not be lifted via concessions by Belgrade. Even rival Bosnian Moslem leaders, during the Geneva peace talks last month, called Mr Milosevic the most flexible of all the Serbian politicians. As a step towards convincing the west of Serbia's good intentions, and making room for manoeuvre in the domestic political arena, Mr Milosevic's ruling Socialist party (SPS) last week turned on Mr Vojislav Seselj, the powerful ultra-nationalist leader. The Serbian Radical Party, once the socialists' unofficial coalition partner, controls a quarter of the seats in the Serbian parliament and has a paramilitary wing. But Mr Seselj seems to have outlived his usefulness. Mr Milosevic's socialists are now blaming Mr Seselj for Serbia's isolation, calling their former puppet a fascist and even hinting he is guilty of war crimes. State-run television broadcasts public denounciations of Mr Seselj and tries to brighten the economic picture. Belgrade officials claim to have slowed Serbia's economic decline after monthly inflation had dropped to 660 from 2,000 per cent. Cooking oil returned to grocery store shelves. but eggs, milk and flour did not. Meat was available, but for most people unattainable. The price of an average basket of shopping still amounted to thousands of dinars. Earlier last week, it had been in the thousands of billions, before the move to strike six zeroes off dinar notes' face value. The state propaganda machine, although it seems to have the field to itself, has failed to mask the sudden impoverishment of the inhabitants of Serbia. Prices of burek, traditional Balkan breakfast fare, now rise twice in one morning. The Belgrade daily Politika reported that prices increased every ten minutes at one restaurant. Pensioners, their faces tearful, comb markets, able to afford little on their monthly income equivalent to DM10 (Pounds 4.08), which buys 10 kilos of potatoes. Mr Milosevic's hopes for easing the sanctions and staving off economic collapse were dashed last week when the Bosnian parliament rejected the latest Serb-Croat proposal for Bosnian partition. Belgrade's Bosnian Serb proxies at the weekend stoked the fires of the Bosnian war, voting to withdraw their territorial concessions if Moslem leaders refused to back the proposed maps. In the event of a settlement, they said, foreign soldiers, including those of Nato, would not be allowed to enforce the plan on Serb-held territory. But the Bosnian government in Sarajevo has made clear that endorsement of the plan hinges on US and Nato engagement. As the Geneva talks on Bosnia unravel, international attentian has focused on the rumbling Serb-Croat conflict. The UN this week will reconsider the prospects for carrying out the Vance peace plan, signed in January 1992. Croat authorities, frustrated by Serbian intransigience, are insisting that the lifting of sanctions on Belgrade be tied to the return of a third of Serb-held land to Croatian control. Mr Milosevic has sent signals that he is ready to hand over Knin, centre of the self-styled Serb state in Croatia. But first he must get rid of the hard-line nationalist opposition, such as Mr Seselj. Mr Milosevic may be willing to make concessions but it is unlikely sanctions will be lifted soon, forcing him to deal with an economic deluge.</p>

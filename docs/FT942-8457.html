			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Seiko, Seiko burning bright 'The brightest watch on the world market,' is the claim made by Seiko of Japan for a new range it is launching later this year. The company's Lumibrite technology - which dispenses with electrical energy and fluorescent paints with small amounts of radioactive substances - provides an initial brightness which Seiko says is up to 10 times greater than with conventional luminous watches. Lumibrite watches use a new Japanese pigment based mainly on aluminium oxides. The watch dial glows brilliantly for four to five hours after 10 minutes exposure to light equivalent to the brightness in a typical office. Seiko UK: UK, 0628 770001</p>

			<p><P> March 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: SCHOOL BID  </P> <P> Saying that "a school like this would have made my life easier," actor Henry  Winkler on Tuesday joined Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich at a  news conference detailing a new recruitment drive for the Los Angeles County  High School for the Arts. The school, founded in 1985 and located on the Cal  State Los Angeles campus, is the only high school of its kind in the county. It  offers an academic and arts curriculum in which students major in theater,  music, visual arts or dance. Applicants must have a 2.0 grade average, need  recommendations from teachers and also must pass an audition. "We take students  with training as well as those with just raw talent," said vice principal  D'liese Melendrez. Applications will be accepted from 10th- and 11th-graders  until April 15.

			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / N Korea unveils law on foreign investment NORTH KOREA yesterday appeared to take its first step along the 'capitalist road' by announcing a new foreign investment law. The communist state said it would allow foreign companies to set up wholly-owned facilities in special economic zones. It also provided details on the taxation of foreign concerns for the first time, with a corporate tax rate of 14 per cent for companies operating in the special zones. Foreign companies will also be given tax concessions during the initial five years of operation if they are involved in high-technology industries, resource development and infrastructure construction. The new law, which was approved by parliament two weeks ago, is a revision of the country's 1984 joint venture rules. Most of the joint ventures now in North Korea are small light industrial enterprises involving pro-Pyongyang Koreans living in Japan. The total capitalisation of joint ventures is estimated at Dollars 100m. No western company has invested in North Korea since it defaulted on international loans in the 1970s. The move by North Korea to attract foreign investment is meant to revive its ailing economy which contracted by 5.2 per cent in 1991 due to a shortage of oil and foreign currency following the deterioration of trade relations with the former Soviet bloc. China, Pyongyang's closest ally, has tried to convince the North Koreans that the adoption of Beijing's market measures, including economic zones, will help them avoid the fate of their former socialist allies in eastern Europe. North Korea announced last December that it was establishing economic zones in the north-east ports of Sonbong and Najin. It also held recent talks with South Korean companies about an industrial park in the western port of Nampo, near Pyongyang. The new investment law, unlike the joint venture law, will allow foreigners to remit part of their profits abroad. It also guarantees property rights, and promises compensation in the case of 'unavoidable' nationalisation. Foreign companies can lease land for up to 50 years in the zones and they will be exempt from tariffs on imported goods, except those designated by North Korea. However, western companies are likely to remain sceptical of the liberal terms offered since they are still owed millions of dollars for products delivered to North Korea two decades ago. North Korea also has one of the worst credit ratings in the world due to its loan defaults. Although Pyongyang announced the new investment law on its overseas news services, no mention was apparently made to the North Korean public, according to South Korean officials. 'The Pyongyang regime may not have wanted to shock the public with a report that could be viewed as an abrupt policy shift to the capitalist line,' said one official with Naewoe Press, the Seoul agency that monitors the North Korean media.</p>

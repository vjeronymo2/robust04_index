			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: European chemicals European chemicals groups reported strong third-quarter profits last week. The scale and speed of recovery has been impressive. Increased volumes and sharply improved prices - in the case of high density polyethylene up 65 per cent year on year - helped drive earnings sharply upwards. The recession's cost-cutting also bore fruit, substantially boosting profits. With the biggest commodity chemicals' price increases implemented towards the end of the third quarter, the final quarter promises to be even better. Those companies benefiting most are involved in upstream activities - supplying plastics, titanium dioxide and other raw materials. Profits at BP Chemicals rose 60 per cent during the first nine months, while DSM turned an after-tax loss during last year's third quarter to a profit this time. Those closer to the customer are doing less well, squeezed between higher raw material costs and consumers' unwillingness to accept higher prices. ICI's paints division and Akzo Nobel were most obviously in discomfort. The shares of ICI, DSM and Akzo all fell on profit-taking after their results. The only exception was Rhone-Poulenc which surprised the market with better than expected figures. The question remains whether the chemical industry's recovery has been fully discounted. If the recovery is as brief as in the last cycle, the shares may be fully valued. But the market may have miscalculated and this cycle could be considerably longer than previous ones. That will depend partly on demand, particularly in Asia. The other factor is supply, which is entirely in the industry's own hands.</p>

Only Ecological Crisis Is More Acute Than Economic  Crisis"]    [Text] "The economic crisis cannot distract society from  resolving the highly acute problems of environmental  protection," Prof. Mikhail Lemeshev, chairman of the Committee  for Ecology, said at a 16 March news conference in the State  Duma. As far as the general situation in the country is  concerned these issues are not so much the concern of future  generations as a matter of life and death for the current  generation.    In his opinion, the solution to the crisis is to ecologize  the economy. Some 18 draft laws will be submitted to the Duma  for consideration in the near future, these laws' task being to  put the national economy back on the rails of stable  development. Prof. Lemeshev described five of them as  priorities. Among them the Law "On Production and Consumption  Waste Products," which is to safeguard the country against  highly toxic imported waste among other things. This question  is causing public concern owing to the furor in connection with  the 18 freightcars of toxins from France, the Netherlands, and  Israel that have unexpectedly shown up in Orenburg Oblast and  pose a real threat to the population's health.    Nikolay Astafyev, chairman of the Committee for Natural  Resources and the Use of Nature, spoke of the need for urgent  addenda to the Russian Federation Law "On Mineral Resources"  since many kinds of minerals will be totally depleted over the  next year if their plunderous extraction is not stopped. The  same can be said of biological resources: wild animals, whole  populations of which are being wiped out for their valuable  antlers or pelts.    Prof. Lemeshev is hoping for constructive cooperation with  the government since, according to him, the Russian Ministry of  the Environment and Natural Resources and the Duma's nature  conservation committees espouse similar positions on key issues.</p>

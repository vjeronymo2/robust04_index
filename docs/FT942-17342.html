			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / World Stock Markets: Italians, cyclicals, consumer stocks lead Europe - The first quarter of 1994 was no time to be a French company, or financial Italian stocks rocketed in the first quarter of 1994, their French counterparts fell, and the oft-mooted switch between financials and cyclical shares was on in a big way. Italy, a below average performer in October and November last year, kicked strongly in December, built on its enthusiasm, and came up with three of the four top performers in the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 index for the first three months of this year. A wave of political optimism, privatisation hopes and a continued upswing in cyclicals lifted the telecoms duo, Sip and Stet, and the carmaker Fiat to an average gain of 39 per cent in local currency terms, compared with a fall of 6 per cent in October/December 1993. Nordic-domiciled stocks are also heavily weighted in the top 10, taking first place and four in all. Once again, this reflects the strength of their domestic equity markets during the quarter; and, taking in Nokia, Electrolux and Volvo, it emphasises the consumer goods orientation which is allied to the current swing to cyclicals. At the bottom end of the table, the 'dogs' are mainly French, financials or both. The French insurers UAP and Axa were very nearly joined by ING, of the Netherlands, and the massive Allianz, of Germany. They are in company with five banking groups: French, Swiss and Irish. Mr Sasha Serafimovski, a vice-president at Merrill Lynch in London, said in mid-March that the group believed economic growth was likely to surprise on the upside in 1995 and stocks geared to demand will prove the best performers. 'The theme of falling interest rates aiding bank stock outperformance,' he wrote, 'is now a dead duck in Europe.' Mr Graham Warren, an insurance analyst at Goldman Sachs, says the insurance companies at the bottom end of the performance table have exaggerated a general trend. 'European equities have fallen by around 5 per cent this year,' he says, 'insurers have underperformed by 5 to 10 per cent and, when funds are looking to sell, they are likely to move first on big, liquid stocks like Allianz and Axa.' Higher interest rates have meant lower bond markets. 'Insurers are nowhere near as interest rate sensitive as is generally assumed,' maintains Mr Warren, 'with their bond holdings matched by liabilities on the other side of the bal-ance sheet; however, investors are not prepared to take the counter-view until there is some stability in the investment market.' Mr Nick Stevenson, European equity strategist at SG Warburg Securities, says first quarter Euro-performance has brought together a collection of investment themes. Alcatel, the second worst performer, is French but cyclical. Its story, however, says Mr Stevenson, has a pan European flavour; the company, and both Siemens and Ericcson to lesser degrees, have suffered from the slowing of the gravy train in big public telecommunications switching equipment, with the trend to digital extension almost having run its course. Alcatel, too, has been the biggest stock in EAFA (European, Australian and Far East) investment fund portfolios and has been overowned. Similarly, Astra's position in the bottom 10, says Mr Stevenson, also has a thematic quality about it which is linked to Alcatel's recent unpopularity. It is a Swedish stock, traded heavily on international markets; 'very international, very American influenced'. Astra produced outstanding results at the end of February, says Mr David Longmuir, a Nordic specialist at James Capel. But worries mounted about pharmaceuticals in general, and about Astra's ulcer drug, Losec, which saw a German threat to its intravenous application at the beginning of March, as well as more general worries about competitive and cheaper ulcer products. Nokia, the best performing Nordic stock, had a very grim 1992 but came back extremely strongly in 1993 with a gain of 209 per cent before topping the charts this year so far. It is one of Europe's biggest television set makers; this may not be wildly exciting, but it ties in with the theory that cyclical and consumer stocks should be this year's performance issues. Nokia is also big in mobile phones, much bigger, says Mr Longmuir, than anyone anticipated, and investors have been having a serious affair with the mobile phone market. Also in Finland, Outokompu, the metals company, has risen on Finland's outstanding stock market performance last year, this year's follow-through and a desperate search for new stories among the country specialists. Outokompu is very big in copper, also in nickel and zinc, and this year's strategic pref-erence for commodity-based issues has given it wings. Electrolux is one of Europe's largest white goods manufacturers, and there have been some optimistic stories around. However, the company, effectively, is going to take over AEG's household appliances operations and may need to issue equity to fund it; the Stockholm market is edgy about rights issues this year. Among the carmakers, probably the most exciting story has been the rise and rise of Fiat, a serious laggard in 1992, an outperformer in 1993 and the best performing car assembler of 1994 so far. Meanwhile, BMW, with its acquisition of the UK's Rover car company, has grabbed the attention of investors looking for the big story, especially with the news - right at the end of the quarter - that BMW was finding its acquisition 'even more interesting' than when it bid for it.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------        FT-SE EUROTRACK 100: WINNERS AND LOSERS, JANUARY 1 - MARCH 31  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Change*                                 Change*             Actual   relative to                             relative to             change  Eurotrack 100                    change   Eurotrack Top 10      percent    percent    Bottom 10          percent 100 percent  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Nokia       36.46      44.47      UAP                (-21.29)  (-18.61) Sip         33.40      41.75      Alcatel Alsthom    (-20.90)  (-18.21) Stet        30.59      38.77      Astra              (-20.43)  (-15.29) Fiat        28.44      36.48      Axa                (-19.25)  (-16.50) Electrolux  26.76      34.95      RWE                (-18.13)  (-14.98) Outokompu   25.44      32.80      Ste Generale       (-17.75)  (-14.96) Mediobanca  16.12      23.39      Allied Irish Banks (-17.38)  (-15.88) BMW         14.75      19.17      CS Holding         (-15.20)  (-10.75) LVMH        13.39      17.24      Swiss Bank Co.

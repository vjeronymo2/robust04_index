			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTIES, ENGINEERS OK RIVER FLOOD JOB  </P> <P> Three Southern California counties and the U.S. Army formalized an agreement  Thursday that clears the way for the construction of flood-control barriers  along the Santa Ana River, with Orange County being the major beneficiary of  the project.  </P> <P> Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties and the Army Corps of Engineers  will share the cost of the $1.1-billion project to improve flood control along  the river that authorities say has the worst potential flood problems west of  the Mississippi.  </P> <P> In October, $20 million in federal funds were authorized to initiate the  project. The agreement says that each year the federal government will  appropriate additional funds until the project is completed.  </P> <P> "The people of Orange County need to realize how important this project is and  how devastated the county will be, with the loss of life and structural damage,  if a flood does occur," said Costa Mesa Mayor Peter Buffa, who is chairman of  the Santa Ana River Flood Protection Agency. "It's just hard to picture it  right now because the river is dry."  </P> <P> The Santa Ana River project includes the construction of a new dam, to be  called "Seven Oaks," four miles upstream from Mentone in San Bernardino County;  raising Prado Dam in Riverside County by 30 feet to expand its capacity from  195,000 to 363,000 acre-feet; widening and deepening channels along the lower  river through Orange County and those along Santiago Creek, and the  construction of a drain in Corona.  </P> <P> In addition, the project will enhance and preserve marshland and wetlands for  endangered waterfowl, fish and wildlife species at the mouth of the river,  according to William Zaun, Orange County's director of public works.  </P> <P> Orange County, which will be the major beneficiary of the massive project, will  pay the major share of the local costs, estimated at more than $400 million.  </P> <P> The river extends from the San Bernardino Mountains to its mouth at Huntington  Beach.

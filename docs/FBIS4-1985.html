			<p>BFN     [Text] Hefei, April 4 (XINHUA) -- Anhui, one of China's  key energy-producing provinces, is boosting local coal industry.    Provided with convenient transport facilities, Anhui began  to  develop local coal mines in the early 1980s in addition to the  expansion of state coal mines. It spent about 200 million yuan  constructing eight mines last year.    The local coal mines still under construction will have a  combined production capacity of 4.92 million tons upon  completion.    With rich coal reserves, Anhui's local mines turned out  10.09  million tons of coal last year.</p>

			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Decision soon on moving units from Guy's Hospital Further controversy over the government's health reforms seems inevitable with expected decisions in the next few days on the future of London's Guy's and Royal Marsden hospitals. It is believed that most of Guy's activities will be transferred to the nearby St Thomas's Hospital leaving it with only a limited number of specialised units as part of the reorganisation of the capital's health service. Any such move by Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, is likely to arouse widespread opposition within the health service. Yesterday Labour's health spokesman Mr David Blunkett said that 'whatever move' the government made it would end up 'wasting taxpayer's money'. The health department said that no date had yet been fixed for Mrs Bottomley's announcement. But the health secretary has been under growing pressure to reveal her intentions well before May's local council elections so that there is more time to calm voters about consequences of the plans based on the report by Sir Bernard Tomlinson. Tomorrow Mrs Bottomley will announce details of the new boundaries for the future regional health authorities as well as appointments of the chairmen who will run them. Mr Blunkett criticised her actions. 'She is pushing ahead pre-emptorily to make the changes a fait accompli.' He criticised the proposed reforms, believing they would make the health service less accountable and lead to greater centralisation. He said that the government's ultimate aim was to abolish all regional health authorities, giving power to the central bureaucracy. Mr Blunkett added that the government would need to pass legislation in the next parliamentary session in order to integrate the health service management into the new structures.</p>

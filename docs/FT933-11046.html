			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Court refuses to lift BCCI freeze THE High Court yesterday refused to lift orders for the unlimited worldwide freezing of assets granted to the liquidators of BCCI in support of their Dollars 10.5bn (Pounds 7bn) claim against Sheikh Khalid Salem Bin Mahfouz and Mr Haroon Rashid Khalon, a retired banker. The orders were originally granted in December and make provision for payment of legal costs and living expenses of Dollars 10,000 a week each. Their continuation had been contested by Sheikh Khalid and Mr Khalon. Mr Justice Rattee also refused an application by Sheikh Khalid to limit the order against him to Dollars 1.5bn. He said he did not accept any of the objections put forward on behalf of Sheikh Khalid or Mr Khalon and continued the injunctions until the liquidators' claim comes to trial.</p>

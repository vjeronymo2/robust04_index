			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lyon, France, March 17 (AFP) -- Some 5,000 students,  protesting against plans to offer youngsters cut-price jobs,  massed in France's second largest city Thursday [17 March],  ahead of a major demonstration by trade unions also called to  oppose the government scheme.    A further 10,000 students took to the streets in other  cities  across France, several hours before the official start of  France's first unified trade union protest in more than 25 years.    In Paris, expected to see the biggest student-worker  turnout,  the protest is due to begin at 3:00 p.m. (1400 GMT).    For the first time since the student-worker riots of May  1968, the country's trade union confederations have buried their  differences and agreed to stage a joint march against Prime  Minister Edouard Balladur's scheme to let employers hire young  people below the minimum wage.    The government, facing 11.3 percent unemployment, a post-war  record, says the scheme aims to slash rocketing youth  unemployment. One out of four French people under 25 years old  in unemployed, which the French say is five times higher than in  neighbouring Germany.    In southeastern Lyon, students waved banners saying "No to  slavery" and "May 68 is not over."    Near the town of Montbeliard, also in the southeast, some  2,500 students blocked the A-36 freeway between Beaune and  Mulhouse. In eastern France, some 1,500 turned out in Belfort  and 2,500 protested near Vesoul.    In the south, several hundred students blocked access to the  city of Toulon while protests of about 1,000 youngsters were  rrported in Montpellier, Nimes and Avignon.    Trade unions in most cities have called later in the day for  a "day of decentralised action" against Balladur's Job Access  Contract (CIP).    The demonstrations will be the fourth challenge by the  unions  to government policy in less than a fortnight and come at a bad  time for the prime minister, facing his first test of electoral  support in nearlky a year at the helm in local elections next  Sunday.    Thursday's protests are backed by the communist-led CGT  [General Confederation of Labor], the socialist CFDT [French  Democratic Confederation of Labor], the moderate Force Ouvriere,  the Christian-inspired CFTC [French Confederation of Christian  Labor], the student UNEF [National Union of French Students]  movement, the teachers' unions FSU and FEN [Normal Schools  Federation] and the FCPE a parents' association.    The row over the CIP erupted in February when Balladur gave  employers the green light to hire students leaving higher  education at as little as 80 percent of the minimum wage of  5,900 francs (roughly 1,000 dollars) a month.</p>

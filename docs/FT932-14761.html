			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Intervention rate decision knocks Paris UNCHANGED intervention rates in Paris gave sentiment a knock yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS, too, continued to reflect disappointment at the slight easing in base rates earlier this week, as the CAC-40 index fell 26.80 to 1,988.63 in turnover of FFr2.4bn. Most of the day's activity took place in Total and Elf, with switching from the latter to the former by some big US houses. Total, recently the subject of a positive broker's note, closed FFr2 higher at FFr272, while Elf slipped FFr2.10 to FFr368.90. Comments by Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, expressing a wish for the suspension of permits to construct new large retail sites, affected Carrefour, down FFr56 at FFr2,674 and Casion, FFr4.90 lower at FFr146.00. Lyonnaise Dumez lost a further FFr21.40 or 4.4 per cent to FFr465.30 following Wednesday's disappointing results. FRANKFURT's DAX index ended 2.77 higher at 1,675.21, 8.34 off its day's high, in turnover up from DM4bn to DM5.6bn. Among the market's superheavyweights, Daimler rose DM2.00 to DM569.50 after an intraday high of DM571.50, Siemens by DM2.60 to DM645.60 after DM649.00 and Deutsche Bank DM2.50 to DM713.00 after DM715.50. Bigger moves were registered lower in the order, with Kaufhof DM16 higher at DM478 and, in the chemicals sector, Degussa up DM6.50 to DM324, Schering DM8 better at DM767 and Henkel DM8.80 lower at DM546.20. Mr Roderick Hinkel at Hoare Govett said that Degussa was recovering from a fall on Tuesday, inspired by unwarranted rumours and by thoughts that trouble in South Africa would put the platinum price higher, and Degussa's catalytic converter business at risk. In fact, he said, the company has made a profit on trading the metal; secondly, Germany gets 80 per cent of its requirements from recycling; and, finally, there has been no halt to platinum production in South Africa to date. AMSTERDAM was impressed by publishers, VNU outperforming with a gain of Fl 2.20 to Fl 118.20. VNU sold its printing division earlier this week. Elsewhere in publishing, Wolters Kluwer advanced 80 cents to Fl 94.20 while Elsevier hit a 12-month intraday high before easing slightly to close 20 cents higher at Fl 136.80. The CBS Tendency index improved 0.4 to 109.6. ING was another of the day's best performers as it reported a rise in 1992 profits, closing 70 cents better at Fl 65.30. ZURICH continued to be weighed down by the weak dollar, leaving industrial stocks lower and the SMI index down 4.8 at 2,160.9. Ciba-Geigy bearers remained under pressure, down SFr14 to SFr623, while Nestle bearers were SFr5 easier at SFr1,140. Among engineers, Sulzer gained SFr16 to SFr726 on a bank's buy recommendation. Investment banks were also firm against the trend after March figures showed sharply higher bourse trading volumes. The day's most active issue, Leu Holding which is losing the chief executive of Leu Bank to Swiss Bank, rose SFr6 to SFr417. MILAN was uncertain, the Comit index edging 3.99 lower to 508.32 in largely technical trading connected with today's end of the monthly account. Volume remained low ahead of this weekend's referendum on electoral reform, in which a vote in favour of change is viewed as a foregone conclusion. However, the size of the majority will be crucial in laying the ground for a new government to tackle the country's political and economic problems, which will provide the lead for the future direction of the bourse. VIENNA saw a fall in the ATX index of 4.59 to 775.27. Austrian Airlines fell another Sch20 to Sch1,530 ahead of today's 1992 results, which are expected to show a loss for the first time in 20 years. ISTANBUL firmed 1.5 per cent after Wednesday's pause for breath, leaving the market to close at its seventh record high this month. The market index added 102.2 to 6,962.52.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- April 15 THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          Open    10.30     11.00    12.00 FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1161.30  1161.49   1161.08  1160.64 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1225.21  1225.36   1226.17  1226.55                         13.00    14.00     15.00    Close FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1159.55  1159.00   1156.38  1156.40 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1225.71  1225.57   1222.35  1220.62  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Apr 14    Apr 13     Apr 8     Apr 7     Apr 6 FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1160.63   1157.54   1151.40   1144.36   1147.43 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1223.50   1220.72   1211.28   1206.25   1210.05  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90) High/day: 100 - 1161.63; 200 - 1227.57 Low/day: 100 - 1154.88 200 - 1219.84.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

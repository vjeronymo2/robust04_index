			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> M. Quality Assurance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under EPA's I/M rule, the SIP must include a description of the quality assurance program, and written procedure manuals covering both overt and covert performance audits, record audits, and equipment audits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The July 21, 1994 submittal from Maine includes a description of the quality assurance program. According to that submittal, the program will include operation and progress reports and overt and covert audits of all emission inspectors and emission inspection facilities to be conducted by the DEP. Written procedures and techniques for overt and covert performance, record, and equipment audits will be prepared and provided to auditors and updated as needed. The July 21, 1994 submission also includes a commitment to conduct a minimum of two (2) covert audits per lane per year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> N. Enforcement Against Contractors, Stations and Inspectors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under EPA's I/M rule, the SIP must include a penalty schedule and legal authority for establishing and imposing penalties, civil fines, station and inspector license suspension, and revocations. In the case of state constitutional impediments precluding immediate authority to suspend licenses, the state Attorney General shall furnish an official opinion within the SIP explaining the constitutional impediment as well as relevant case law. The SIP also must describe the administrative and judicial procedures and responsibilities relevant to the enforcement process, including the agencies, courts, and jurisdictions involved, personnel to prosecute and adjudicate cases, and other aspects of the enforcement of the program requirements, the resources to be allocated to the enforcement function, and the source of those funds. In states that are without immediate suspension authority, the SIP must demonstrate that sufficient resources, personnel, and systems are in place to meet the three-day case management requirement for violations that directly affect emission reductions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Maine I/M SIP revision includes specific penalties in its enforcement against contractors, stations and inspectors in accordance with the federal I/M rule. Based on its SIP submittal dated July 21, 1994, the State's enforcement procedures can be pursued through contractual or regulatory action. The DEP has the authority to immediately suspend a station inspector for violations that directly affect emission reduction benefits. Authority for establishing and imposing penalties, civil fines, license suspension, and revocations are contained in the contract. The DEP is planning to assign employees to covert and overt auditing and commit additional resources required for enforcement oversight. These audits and oversight functions will be funded by the inspection fee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> O. Data Analysis and Reporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under EPA's I/M rule, the SIP must describe the types of data to be collected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Maine I/M SIP provides for collecting test data to link specific test results to specific vehicles, I/M program registrants, test sites, and inspectors. The SIP lists the specific types of test data and quality control data which will be collected. As outlined above and described in the May 26, 1994 and July 21, 1994 submittals, the data will be used to generate reports concerning test data, quality assurance, quality control, enforcement, as well as necessary changes and identified weaknesses in the program. The state has also committed to collecting all data necessary for the quality assurance and enforcement reports, as required by 51.366 of the federal I/M rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> P. Inspector Training and Licensing or Certification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under EPA's I/M rule, the SIP must include a description of the training program, the written and hands-on tests, and the licensing or certification process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The May 26, 1994 and July 21, 1994 submittals from the DEP provide detail on the inspector training program. The Maine I/M SIP provides for implementation of training, licensing, and refresher programs for emission inspectors. The SIP describes the program and curriculum including written and hands-on testing at least once every two years. All inspectors will be required to be licensed to inspect vehicles in the Maine I/M program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 10 KYODO -- Opposition party leaders on  Tuesday chided Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata for failing to  provide policy specifics in his first speech to the Diet.    Yohei Kono, president of the No. 1 opposition Liberal  Democratic Party, accused Hata of trying to please everybody by  avoiding specific statements on "urgent" controversial issues.  Kono told reporters Hata "stopped short of commenting on how to  grapple with problems that require urgent responses under the  current extraordinary situation."    Tomiichi Murayama, head of the second largest opposition  Social Democratic Party, told reporters Hata should have offered  a more explicit explanation on "a statement by his cabinet  minister on collective security arrangements."    "The public has come to question the stand of this  administration in the wake of a statement by a cabinet minister  on collective security rights," Murayama said.    He was apparently referring to a recent statement by Foreign  Minister Koji Kakizawa that Japan should rethink its current  constitutional interpretation, taken as banning collective  security arrangements, to allow Japan the right to join an  offensive if an ally were attacked.    Japanese Communist Party Presidium Chairman Tetsuzo Fuwa  told  reporters that Hata's expression of the government's readiness  to respond to a contingency on the Korean peninsula in concert  with the United States and South Korea was "a dangerous  declaration."    New party Sakigake [Harbinger] leader Masayoshi Takemura  said, "Although he emphasized the pacifist nature of the  Constitution, it does not correspond with arguments by his  cabinet ministers about the need to enact laws to deal with  military contingencies or collective security rights."</p>

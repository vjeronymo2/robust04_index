(``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Currently CBOE Rule 6.77, ``Stock Execution Services,'' states that a stock service is a member registered with the Exchange for the purpose of providing stock execution services to market makers on the CBOE's floor. The CBOE proposes to amend CBOE Rule 6.77 to replace ``stock service'' with ``order service firm'' and to allow order service firms to take market maker orders for the purchase or sale of commodity futures contracts and options thereon and forward the orders to the appropriate futures exchange. In addition, the CBOE proposes to adopt CBOE Rule 6.78, ``Letters of Guarantee Required of Order Service Firms,'' which requires an order service firm to have on file with the Exchange and in effect an Order Service Firm Letter of Guarantee issued for the service firm by a member of the Options Clearing Corporation (``OCC''). Under proposed CBOE rule 6.78(b), the letter of guarantee must provide that the issuing clearing member accepts financial responsibility for all orders handled by the order service firm on the CBOE floor and for all financial obligations of the order service firm to the Exchange.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The text of the proposal is available at the Office of the Secretary, CBOE, and at the Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The CBOE states that the purpose of the proposal is to permit members that are registered as ``stock services'' under CBOE Rule 6.77 to expand the scope of their activity on the floor of the CBOE to encompass order handling services in connection with commodity interests. Currently CBOE Rule 6.77 provides that a member organization that is registered with the CBOE as a ``stock service'' may provide stock execution services to market makers on the floor of the Exchange. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  The proposal would revise CBOE Rule 6.77 to permit designated member organizations also to take orders for the purchase or sale of commodity interests from market makers on the floor of the Exchange and forward such orders to the appropriate futures exchange. The execution of all orders to purchase or sell commodity interests would occur on a futures exchange that has been designated as a contract market by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``CFTC''). To reflect more accurately the expanded scope of activities permitted under CBOE Rule 6.77, the term ``stock service'' would be deleted from CBOE Rules 3.1, ``Public Securities Business,'' 6.20, ``Admission to and Conduct on the Trading Floor,'' and 6.77 and replaced with the term ``order service firm.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The services provided by these firms generally consist of taking orders for the purchase or sale of stocks and forwarding these orders to broker-dealers for execution. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The CBOE believes that the proposed rule change will facilitate market making capacity in stock index options. Market makers in stock index options are subject to the risk that market price will change before they can liquidate their positions, and hedge this risk by executing transactions in related commodity interests. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  The proposed rule change would facilitate the ability of market makers in stock index options to execute hedging transactions by providing them with a more efficient means of effecting such transactions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Division of Market Regulation,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Market Analysis of October 13 and 16, 1989  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> (December 1990) at 73&hyph;74. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

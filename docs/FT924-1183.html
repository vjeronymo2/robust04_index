			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Jelly ball toys are banned STOCKING-FILLER Christmas toys known as jelly balls were banned yesterday. The brightly coloured golfball-sized toys are designed to be thrown at walls, where they stick before slowly trickling downwards. The government has served prohibition notices on 14 companies.

Brand names covered are: Jelly Balls, Kung Fu Balls, Splat Balls, Splat Eggs, Splat Tomatoes, Slime Balls, Sticky Balls, Tacky Wacky Wall Rollers, Spike Balls, Sticky Flying Hammers, Hand Hammer Sticky Catchers, Sticky Hand, Sticky Flicker and Sticky Troll.</p>

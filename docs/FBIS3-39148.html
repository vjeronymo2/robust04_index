			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Kostas Venizelos] </F>   [Text] Government experts have prepared two documents on  the confidence-building measures. Based on reliable I SIMERINI  information, the first document, which contains suggestions and  observations on specific aspects of the package, is at the  foreign minister's office and the National Council members can  pay a visit for a briefing. The second, nine-page document has  been given to the National Council members in light of their  scheduled meeting next Tuesday.    The confidential document entitled "Basic Principles and  Positions on the Confidence-Building Measures" does not answer  any concerns stemming from the UN proposals. Referring to the  issue of recognition, the document points out that in order for  there to be recognition of the pseudostate, our side must first  give its consent. It goes on to suggest that our side reiterate  its position that it does not intend to recognize the  pseudostate is added at this point. The document refers  extensively to passages from UN Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali's report (July) and his recent letter to the two  sides.    The document lists the following as our side's basic  positions on the confidence-building measures:    First: Cyprus' sovereignty will be maintained and  implementation will not contain elements of direct or indirect  recognition.    Second: UN authority over Nicosia Airport and Varosha will  be  temporary and its orders will be in line with the international  organization's resolutions.    Third: Settlement in these two areas is strictly temporary.    Fourth: Neither side will change positions.    Fifth: An agreement and implementation of the  confidence-building measures does not imply a Cyprus solution.    The first document, which has not been given to the  political  leaders, is lengthy and in general describes the Greek Cypriot  policy and approach on the talks.    The documents were prepared by a group of government experts  (Triandafillidhis, Soulioti, and other officials) as well as  Brownling and Aimiliou, who work in London. The three documents  were sent to Brownling last May, when they were submitted to the  sides, and he decided that there was no issue of recognition.  The government then sought a second opinion from Greek  specialists, who warned of the dangers. Following this  development, a group of experts was formed to study the  confidence-building measures in detail.</p>

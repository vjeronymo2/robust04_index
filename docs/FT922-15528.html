			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Election 1992: Lib Dems court key tactical voters THE LIBERAL Democrats changed tack in their campaign yesterday and appealed directly to voters in more than 260 seats where the former Alliance parties came second in 1987, mostly to the Conservatives. The switch away from policy issues marked a recognition that the party's chances of making gains next week depend heavily on mobilising anti-Conservative voters. Mr Des Wilson, campaign director, avoided talk of 'tactical voting'. The party is determined to be even-handed and highlight also the seats where they are second to Labour. But they risk upsetting supporters in constituencies not on Mr Wilson's list. Ironically, the launch coincided with campaigning by Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, in Scotland where the party benefits from the first-past-the-post system. Liberal Democrats are defending 10 Scottish seats and may lose only one or two. In the vast Inverness constituency, where Liberal Democrat Sir Russell Johnston faces a difficult task fighting off Labour, Mr Ashdown's visit was overshadowed by Scottish nationalist protesters who out-shouted a rainy walkabout in the shopping centre. Adding to Mr Ashdown's misfortune, his visit had to be truncated when the closure of Aberdeen airport forced a long coach journey and the cancellations of events there. At a rally in the city Mr Ashdown said: 'In nearly half of the constituencies at this election, it is the Liberal Democrats who are the challengers. As we move forward again, it is increasingly the Liberal Democrats who can win.' The Liberal Democrat campaign against the 'wasted vote' syndrome reflects frustration about the domination of the campaign by Labour and the Tories. A party election broadcast today will list 261 constituencies, mostly in southern England, where the Liberal Democrats are the main challengers and refer to three-way marginals where the party might also have a chance. Afterwards the campaign will be focused at a local level in 'best prospect' seats. Mr Wilson quoted a Harris survey in September showing 47 per cent of voters would back Liberal Democrats if the party had a chance of winning. In Aberdeen, Mr Ashdown said a sign of the growing Liberal Democrat success was 'the sign of the growing panic of the other two parties'. At his London press conference earlier Mr Ashdown had said: 'There is something different happening out there.' Personal view, Page 22</p>

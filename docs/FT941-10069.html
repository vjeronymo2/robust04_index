			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Engineering employers seek fresh link with CBI The Engineering Employers' Federation is making a fresh attempt to cement ties with the Confederation of British Industry following the scrapping of their plan to merge central activities. Mr Graham Mackenzie, the federation's president and acting director-general, said yesterday that it is looking at a 'close alliance' with the CBI on areas where they overlap. It is focusing on overlaps with the CBI's National Manufacturing Council on issues such as manufacturing representation and policy, and European Union matters. Mr Mackenzie said he would be presenting a paper to the federation's council next week, on entering into a memorandum of understanding with the CBI. This would draw the EEF into a joint programme of alliance with the council. The proposal is designed to avoid the same obstacles that tripped up the original merger plan. The EEF's 14 regional associations opposed the deal because of worries that the services they receive may no longer be suitable for engineer-ing companies if the EEF's central functions were merged with the CBI or the council. But Mr Mackenzie stressed that the associations would retain their autonomy, and that the federation would keep control of the services it offers. The uncertainty over the future of the EEF has delayed the search for a new director-general since the abrupt resignation of Mr Neil Johnson in the autumn. However, Mr Mackenzie said the federation was 'here to stay' and within the past two weeks it had begun searching for a replace-ment. If Mr Mackenzie's proposal is approved next week, details will then be worked out. Meanwhile the federation has set up an internal working party to discuss other areas of potential co-operation with the CBI such as employment policy.</p>

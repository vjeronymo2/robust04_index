			<p><P> November 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Perkin-Elmer May Be Sold to Japanese Firm: Japanese companies are negotiating  to purchase Perkin-Elmer Corp., one of the last American manufacturers of  equipment used to make semiconductor chips, the New York Times reports. If the  sale is completed, it could make the United States largely dependent on Japan  for such tools. The Times said the Nikon Corp. is considered the leading bidder  for Perkin-Elmer, whose biggest client is International Business Machines.  Perkin-Elmer has been unsuccessful in finding an American buyer.  </P></p>

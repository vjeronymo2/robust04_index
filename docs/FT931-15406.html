			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Housing choices THE GOVERNMENT wishes to encourage the revival of the private rented sector of the UK housing market to improve choice. It also wants to reduce tax subsidies for homeowners, to reduce public expenditure. Progress towards both aims could be achieved by sweeping away mortgage interest tax relief at the next Budget. Not only would this save over Pounds 5bn of public spending next year, it would help restore the fiscal balance between different types of housing tenure. Modest investment incentives for landlords might also be considered to stimulate the private rented sector. However, instant abolition of mortgage interest tax relief is inadvisable economically and infeasible politically. The loss of this subsidy would almost certainly depress house prices further and thus impede the hoped-for recovery. Politically, the most obvious problem is that the Conservatives' election manifesto promised to maintain mortgage interest tax relief. The government is unlikely to overturn such an unambiguous pledge, especially since the extension of home ownership in the 1980s is seen as one of its greatest achievements. However, the absence of any qualification insisting that mortgage interest tax relief be retained in its present form offers some scope for manoeuvre. First, the tax relief could be capped at its present level. It has already been restricted to the first Pounds 30,000 of loans for over a decade. Since 1991, it has also been limited to the basic rate of tax of 25 per cent. Meanwhile falling interest rates have reduced its value to around Pounds 600 a year per mortgage. Capping would prevent the bill rising if interest rates rise in the future. Second, the rate of tax relief could be trimmed from 25 per cent to 20 per cent, the new lower rate of tax introduced in the last Budget. This would cost homeowners not much more than Pounds 10 a month, an amount unlikely to depress house prices further. The level of tax relief could be further cut once the housing market recovers. Neither step would do much to help improve the government's fiscal position, saving perhaps Pounds 1bn at most. But by capping the cost and beginning to ratchet it down, progress would at last begin towards abolishing a subsidy which has distorted the housing market for too long.</p>

			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / Hitches fail to halt bid for Channel 5 THAMES TELEVISION is expected to go ahead tomorrow with a bid for Channel 5 with the full backing of its parent, Thorn EMI, in spite of last-minute setbacks with potential shareholders. Channel 5 Holdings, the consortium bidding for the franchise, is not a fully-funded venture so a large part of its equity would have to be raised on winning the licence. Sony Pictures, the Hollywood studio group and one of the main potential shareholders in the Thames-led consortium, is to decide on the venture after studying the final bid document. Canwest, the Winnipeg-based international broadcaster and another potential shareholder, has submitted a contract insisting on managerial control of the venture. This would almost certainly have invalidated the bid. Under the 1990 Broadcasting Act, control of the channel has to be held by European Community companies. Canadian newspapers yesterday reported that Mr Izzy Asper, the owner of Canwest, was preparing to pull out of the consortium. The growing uncertainties over the financial backing for the consortium increases the chances that the Independent Television Commission will decide not to award the licence. Channel 5 Holdings appears to be the only potentially viable applicant for the commercial television channel, which is capable of reaching 75 per cent of the UK population. Thames is planning to submit a bid which will tackle the main barrier facing Channel 5 - the retuning of several million video recorders which are likely to suffer interference from the signal. The consortium's bid will be accompanied by a letter from a merchant bank saying the project is capable of being funded. While the commission is studying the bid, the consortium hopes to raise a large enough proportion of the funding to justify the award of the licence. After a licence is awarded, an operator has 12 weeks to complete the financing. If no suitably qualified applicant comes forward, the commission will return the problem and the spare frequencies to the government. Apart from the cost of re-tuning, which will probably involve at least Pounds 50m, any operator of Channel 5 will have to persuade viewers in most parts of the country to buy a new conventional aerial to receive the service.</p>

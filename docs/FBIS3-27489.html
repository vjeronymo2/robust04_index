(Wang Yunling) was sentenced to death with a two-year  reprieve and was deprived of his political rights for life.    As announced by the Fuxin City Intermediate People's Court,  the accused (Wang Yunling) took advantage of the preparations by  the Fuxin City Goods and Materials Bureau and the agency of the  Hong Kong Transportation and Trade Corporation in Guangzhou to  extablish a joint corporation to accept bribes of 150,000 yuan  in Renminbi and 15,000 yuan in Hong Kong dollars on four  occasions from April to November 1992. In another instance,  when the Fuxin City Goods and Materials Bureau was compensated  for the the right to use state-owned land, (Wang Yunling)  accepted bribes of 100,000 yuan in Renminbi from Shenyang  (Mulan) Corporation in March 1993.    In October 1993, when details of the case were revealed,  (Wang Yunling) showed repentance for his crime, frankly  confessed to details that had not been ferreted out by judicial  organizations, and returned all the illicit money.</p>

			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Metal Bulletin advances 22% Metal Bulletin, the international business publisher, raised pre-tax profits by 22 per cent from Pounds 711,600 to Pounds 871,300 in the six months to June 30 and, based on current activity levels, there was optimism that five consecutive years of growth would be extended in 1993. Mr Trevor Tarring, chairman, said the period had seen a continuation of the growth pattern first experienced late in 1992 by the metals, futures and options and managed funds divisions. The minerals information side continued to be a solid contributor to profits, while the textiles division - acquired at the end of 1992 - had been successfully integrated and was exceeding its budget for turnover and profit. Group turnover expanded 19 per cent to Pounds 6.91m (Pounds 5.81m). Earnings per 10p share rose from 5.1p to 6p and an increased interim dividend of 2.9p (2.7p) is declared.</p>

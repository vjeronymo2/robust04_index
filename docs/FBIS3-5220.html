			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 5 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Deputy Prime  Minister Yi Yong-tok voiced confidence Saturday that North Korea  would eventually agree to exchange special envoys, possibly  before the Pyongyang-Washington high-level meeting on March 21,  because it knows the exchange is a must for the talks with the  United States.    In an interview with Japan's YOMIURI SHIMBUN, Yi,  concurrently national unification board minister, said the  Seoul-Pyongyang summit proposed by President Kim Yong-sam is  possible anytime once the exchange is realized, hinting that  South Korea is making necessary preparations.    If North Korea does not meet one of the prerequisites to a  third-level meeting set by the United States -- full  implementation of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  inspections and an inter-Korean exchange of special envoys -- it  will have difficulty realizing the March 21 talks in Geneva, Yi  said.    Seoul and Washington have agreed to put off the March 21  meeting if Pyongyang fails to meet the two conditions, he added.    "It is hard to predict the North's attitude," Yi said,  commenting on the collapse of inter-Korean working-level  dialogue on Thursday. "But we expect great progress on March  9," he said. South and North Korea, without attaining tangible  results on Thursday, agreed in principle to the envoy exchange  and to meet next week for further discussions. He reiterated  that Seoul wants to see visits by president-designated envoys  from each side take place before March 21.</p>

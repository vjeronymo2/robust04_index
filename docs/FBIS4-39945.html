			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by own correspondent T. Borisevich: "Yesterday an </F> Autonomous Body -- Today a State"]    [Text] Republic of Komi -- In Syktyvkar Yuriy Spiridonov,  who won the election of the head of the Republic of Komi, has  assumed office. The day before a Supreme Council session  adopted laws on the state emblem, the state flag, and the state  anthem of the Republic of Komi. The Constitution was adopted  slightly earlier.    It thus has all the attributes of its own statehood. From  slogans and declarations sovereignty has traveled the path to  more real symbols.    Yesterday autonomy -- today the state.    In his greetings telegram Boris Yeltsin called the republic  one of the most authoritative components of Russian statehood.  The president put a lot into this admission: The authority of  Yuriy Spiridonov, the republic's new head, the fact that the  republic was one of the first to suggest its own version of the  Federation Treaty, and the fact that it struggled to the end for  its inclusion in the new Russian Constitution.    Unfortunately, not everything is successful. Sovereignty is  still considerably truncated. Both by the legislators and by  life. Today in the national republic the people who gave it its  name are in the minority. Komi's villages are dying because  they are the provincial and national hinterland. In previous  "allocation" years the republic was given at least something.  Now it has been deprived even of those crumbs. Its own  production does not feed it. It runs at a loss in the North.  Consumer services are no longer subsidised. That means that  the village dweller cannot get a haircut, get a television  repaired, or get a dress sewn. But even that is not a  misfortune. They trim each other's hair and continue to wear  old dresses instead of new ones.    The trouble lies elsewhere. Children from the hinterland no  longer get into the institutes and it is not only studying in  the city but even getting there that is a problem. Even  professional schools have become unattainable. There is no  longer the influx of young specialists to the hinterland. And  without them there will soon be no one to give people medical  treatment and teach children even in the national school. That  means the mortality rate will rise and the educational standard  will decline. And all this will affect primarily the indigenous  inhabitants. So, for small peoples like the Komi their own  statehood (even if it is simply declared) is nonetheless a  blessing.    Where apart from its own state will the Komi language  receive  the status of a state language? Where else would they have  managed to develop and introduce at state level with financing  from the budget programs for development of the Komi language  and national culture, to open a Komi philology faculty, and  publish books, journals, and newspapers in the Komi language?    For an example I shall just cite part of the budget items  for  this year: The publication of national literature, expenditure  on the production of the "Parma-Yel" newsreels, expenditure on  the implementation of the law "On the State Languages of the  Republic of Komi" and "The Conservation and Development of the  Komi Language."    But that is one side of the "state" coin. To build -- a  house or a state -- you need money. Money is a yardstick of  true autonomy, independence, and freedom. And a state is only a  state when it controls money circulation, taxes, and the  economy. But what can we talk of if, for instance, the republic  does not even have the funds even to pay people their leave pay.  For the social sphere alone 71 billion rubles are needed for  the purpose, with 42 billion being needed for national  education. That means they have to go cap in hand to the center  and ask for a loan. That is where its own independence ends.    However many serious entrepreneurs visit Komi not one of  them  has refrained from asking: Why, when it has stocks of oil,  coal, gas, titanium ore, and timber, is the republic unable to  secure a fitting life for its citizens? The answer to this  question is on the surface. The bulk of revenue goes into the  Federal Budget. So the national republic's economic autonomy is  impossible in principle. Moreover, the republic's minister of  finances and the tax chief get their wages in Moscow. And that  says a lot. Here the center speaks the same taxation and  investment language with all components of the Federation while  the North is quite different from the South and that means the  language should be different.    Today a 700-gramme loaf of bread in Ust-Tsilma (a Komi rayon  center) costs 1,354 rubles. Because everything, from grain to  sugar, has to be imported. There are families where bread has  become a treat and the main food is potatoes, which thankfully  still grow in the North. In previous years they would at least  sometimes issue child benefit. This year not a kopek has been  received for this item from the Federal Budget. This financial  and legislative dependence of the region on the center weakens  not only the sovereign republic but also the center.    Boris Yeltsin once signed a package of documents on the  economic and social development of the Republic of Komi. They  were the precursor to the Federation's civilized economic  cooperation with one of its components. But they did not  succeed. The documents are not working. The proposals of the  components of the federation to move from the fiscal tax system  to fixed payments into the Russian budget are being ignored. In  this situation the territories have started to unite on regional  lines, creating associations like the "Northwest," "Great Volga"  and others.    The election of their own presidents and republic heads in  yesterday's autonomous bodies is from the same "series." As a  result, Russia today outstrips Europe in terms of the number of  presidents. The Republic of Komi is one of the most recent to  take this step. This will undoubtedly strengthen its statehood.  But Russian statehood?</p>

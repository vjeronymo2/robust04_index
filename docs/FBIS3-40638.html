Thengadi: "Liberalization Under GATT and </F> U.S. Is a Downright Fraud"]    [Text] In spite of all the propaganda in favour of `free  trade' concept Ruigrok informs us that the pattern of global  trade looks as follows:    --approximately 25 percent takes place inside global  companies--(intra-company trade),    --approximately 25 percent is bilateral trade (by  preferential agreements),    --approximately 25 percent is barter trade,    --approximately 25 percent can be considered `free trade'  governed by GATT rules.    The author has quoted this from FAST (Forecasting and  Assessment in Science and Technology).    While advocating the principle of free trade, the US has  been  following the policy of protectionism regarding textiles right  from 1956 when the President was given the authority under the  Agricultural Act to negotiate agreements for limiting "imports  into the United States of Textiles or Textile products." In the  1980s, the US administration employed non-tariff barriers to  insulate the US automobile industry from the competitive threat  that, as in the case of the textile industry, was posed by  Japanese imports. (As James Dunn points out, post-war  international trade in automobiles has always been a mixture of  liberalising and protecting elements.)    Japan is, in many cases, a one-way trader, not importing any  of the product categories it exports. The same is the case with  the Japanese foreign investment imbalance. As at 31st March,  1990, Japanese direct investments abroad amounted to seventeen  times the value of FDI in Japan. Japanese competitiveness and  huge trade and investment imbalances have contributed, according  to experts, to the EC and US conflicts with Japan in industrial  products. `Toyotism' of Japanese industry has given it a great  advantage over `Fordism' of the US and EC industries. To cite a  single example. In the 60s and 70s, the EC's ship-building  industry could not stand a threat from Japanese ship-building  companies' aggressive marketing strategies.    With the present growth of Japan's foreign direct  investments  in the EC and the US, the industries of the latter are demanding  more trade barriers and greater protection (Though recently  Japanese economy also is showing signs of decay).    It is interesting to note that criticism of free trade  doctrine has been gaining ground as the EC and the US have been  meeting with increasingly fierce competition in a number of  industries. Many of the earlier champions of the doctine are  today its critics.    This opportunism is not a new phenomenon. When German goods  were dominating British markets, Britain was the worst critic of  free trade principle. After industrial revolution, the equation  changed and Britain became the best champion of free trade  doctrine.    The current American concept of "fairness in trade" reminds  Biswajit Dhar of Gladstone's remark made more than a century ago  under similar situation: "It (fairness in trade) bears  suspicious likeness to our old friend protection."    The decline in the economic strength of the United States  started in the 1960s. The process of the end of its hegemony  commenced around 1973. By the 1980s the United States had come  to be established as the economic power going rapidly down hill.  Several authors like Linder and others have predicted the end of  the US hegemony in the international economy during the early  period of the next century. With every new set-back, the US has  been deviating progressively from the principle of free trade,  and by this time it has completely abandoned that once-sacred  doctrine. These recent developments and deviations in the US  trade strategy have been aptly elaborated by Biswajit Dhar in  his The Decline of Free Trade and US Trade Policy  Today.    At the level of policy, the demise of `non-interventionist'  mode can be seen clearly in the case of US where trade  administration has adopted an "activist" trade policy,  particularly during the last two decades. While the increased  doses of protectionism formed the core of the nature of State  intervention in the earlier years--seeking increased  market--access for US products by compelling its partner  countries to change their policies and become "more open." It,  i.e., protectionism has now become the sole thrust of the  policy--initiative in recent years. Trade legislation in US  since 1974 indicates this trend. The Omnibus Trade and  Competitiveness Act of 1988, particularly through its two new  provisions, namely, Super 301 and Special 301, unfolds fully the  intentions of the policy makers.    The protectionist measures adopted by the US have abrogated  the basic principles of non-intervention in trade, underlying  the post-war trading system governed by the GATT rules. Specific  and systematic trade barriers have been raised by the US, in  violation of the GATT rules. This has grossly undermined the  multi-lateral trading system. In response to the competitive  threats from Japan and other newly exporting countries, the US  curbed imports by using increasing doses of protectionism  achieved through imposition of the non-tariff barriers, and  increased exports by forcing open foreign markets using the  powers of trade retaliation that were assumed by the US  President through the Trade Acts of 1974 and 1988. The first  phase gave protection to domestic producers against imports.  Quota restrictions on exports to the US were imposed. The US  trade administration frequently imposed Voluntary Export  Restraints (VERs) and Orderly Marketing Arrangements (OMAs) on  several countries.    The more prominent industries that were provided  import-protection were steels, automobiles, textiles, machine  tools and semi-conductors. Section 301 of the 1974 Act was  directed at the policies of foreign governments which did not  provide free access to US products in their markets. In 1985,  the insurance industry in Korea was targeted for this purpose,  the action under section 301 of the 1974 Act was initiated.  Between 1985 and 1988, when the Omnibus Trade and  Competitiveness Act was passed, Section 301 was used 26 times.    In the 1988 Act, two changes were made in Section 301. Super  301 was introduced to deal with general and systematic trade  barriers imposed by different countries, while Special 301 was  introduced to deal with cases relating to insufficient  protection of intellectual property rights of US origin.    Under Super 301, action could be initiated against the  entire  gamut of trade and trade related policies that the infringing  partners were following in retaliation against a sector or an  industry-specific infringement. In other words, Super 301  provided for cross retaliation between sectors.    Secondly, Super 301 introduced a time-frame for identifiable  specific cases of trade distortions, and initiating cases  against countries which, according to US, were obstructing US  exports. The cases under Super 301 were to be initiated in 1989  and 1990, and the retaliatory action against the "identified"  infringing countries were to be carried out within 180 days of  establishing that trade distortions were liable for retaliation.    Special 301 covers infringement of intellectual property  rights of US origin causing distortions in US exports. Special  301 was to ensure that US exports could be increased by  compelling countries to provide a stronger monopoly to US  commercial interests in their markets through an appropriate  system of intellectual property protection that the US trade  administration deemed fit.    Unlike provisions under section 337, the Special 301  provision did not put the onus on the complainant to "Prove" the  injury. The US International Trade Commission was simply  required to institute inquiry into the complaint and grant  protection, all within 90 days of the registering of the  complaint.    In May, 1989, the USTR identified three countries: India,  Japan and Brazil and put them on the list of priority countries  for action under Super 301; and six trade-distorting  practices--the `priority practices'--of these countries were  identified, India was found to restrict US exports from entering  its markets through two "priority practices."    (a) Foreign investors in the country were required to export  a part of the produce, and to use locally produced inputs,  thereby causing trade distortions, and    (b) US service industries were prevented from competing in  the Indian market. India's market was completely closed to  foreign insurance companies.    A new list of `priority practices' under Super 301 was  issued  in April, 1990. The list had two cases and both involved India.  The two priority practices of India listed in 1989 were again  included in the 1990 list. Japan and Brazil were excluded. Trade  barriers to insurance and investment in India were particularly  irritating.    In 1989 and 1990, four countries--India, China, Thailand and  Brazil, were put on the priority watch list. In April 1991, USTR  decided to initiate proceedings under the Special 301 clause.  India, China and Thailand were named as priority countries for  action under Special 301.    The US is insisting upon free trade and the so-called  `liberalisation'. The US experts have excelled Dr Goebels in the  propaganda techniques. "Repeat a lie hundred times, and it  becomes the truth," Dr Goebels said. Hitler went a step further.  He said that if a lie is to be circulated, you should not give a  simple lie, give a big bluff--so big that people will not be  able, because of the magnitude of the given lie, to suspect that  such a big news may be a lie. Because of the American propaganda  the doctrine of economic liberalisation became popular in the  last two decades. De-regulation and privatisation have acquired  respectability and authenticity. The IMF and the World Bank  have been striving to sell `liberatisation' doctrine to the  third world countries by imposing on the debtor countries.  Policy of economic liberalisation as a condition of further  credit. The GATT and the US are preaching the free trade  principle as a sacred gospel truth. But the US is itself  violating this "sacred" principle. The US is also violating the  standards evolved by the International Organisation for  Standardisation. The US public procurement policies are not in  confirmity with the GATT Government Procurement code.  `Buy-American' restrictions cover vast area. There were  thirty-one significant cases of special protection which covered  four broad sectors--manufacturing, mining, agriculture and  fisheries. Some other services also are being given protection.  It is subsidising heavily its farm sector, while demanding that  other countries should withdraw all subsidies to that sector. It  is following double-standards in case of pharmaceutical sector  also.    These are clearly the unprincipled bullying tactics. The  culprits in this crime are the rulers and the big capitalists of  the US--not its common masses who are themselves kept in the  dark about developments on economic front. These bullying  tactics are being employed not only against the southern,  developing countries, but also against European community and  North American peoples. The recent militant reaction of French  farmers and the strong support given to their gesture by farmers  of other European countries; the agitation of the working people  of US against the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA);  the effective protest registered by Canadian voters against the  ruling party that became a signatory to the notorious NAFTA; the  demonstration (on October 2) by 12 purely American organisations  of environmentalists and humanitarians against the modus  operandi of Cargill--all these indicate that the unholy alliance  between the rulers and the big capitalists of US is operating  not only against the third world countries, but also against  other developed white countries, and even against the less  privileged masses of US itself.    And these culprits are the champions of free trade,  liberalisation and globalisation--a case of Satan Quoting the  Bible.    To sum up:    In its present form--    `Liberalisation' of the GATT and the US is a down-right  fraud.    `Liberalisation' of Dr Manmohan Singh is sheer gullibility.    `Liberalisation' of our air-conditioned radicals is  ignorance  or hypocricy.    `Liberalisation' is a grave challenge to patriots of all  non-American countries.    Hence the propriety and urgency of `Swadeshi' for all  non-American peoples of the world.    Genuine liberalisation and hegemonic globalisation can never  go together. The Hindu concept of globalisation represents  genuine globalisation.    The Hindu version of globalisation is fairly well known to  all Hindus who are not self-alienated: For them the elaboration  of Hindu concept may be a superfluous repetition of whatever  they know already. For the benefit of the de-Hindised Hindus a  brief restatement of the same may, however, be helpful here.    Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya, who could conceive of the  Central  State Authority without stateism, envisaged evolution of the  world state enriched by the growth and contribution of  different national cultures, as well as the flowering of the  Manava Dharma, enriched by the perfection of all the religions  including `materialism'.    Revered Sri Guruji believed that the world unity and human  welfare can be made real only to the extent mankind realises the  ultimate, absolute Vedantic truth that "all is one." What he  implied was not elimination of all distinctive features of  nations and rolling them all into one uniform pattern. He  visualised various groups of peoples coming together in a spirit  of familism realising the innate oneness of mankind while  preserving their individual identities and special  characteristics. The different human groups are marching  forward, all towards the same goal, each in its own way and in  keeping with its own characteristic genius. The destruction of  the special characteristics, whether of an individual or of a  group, will destroy not only the natural beauty of harmony but  also its joy of self-expression. To seek harmony among the  various and diverse characteristics has been our special  contribution to the world thought. "The World State of our  concept," says Sri Guruji, "will evolve out of a federation of  autonomous and self-contained nations under a common centre  linking them all...it is the grand world-unifying thought of  Hindus alone that can supply the abiding basis for human  brotherhood, that knowledge of the inner spirit which will  charge the human mind with the sublime urge to toil for the  happiness of mankind, while opening out full and free scope for  every small life-speciality on the face of the earth to grow to  its full stature. Verily, this is the one real practical  world-mission, if ever there was one," he remarked.    This Hindu concept has been elucidated elaborately by Rishi  Aurobindo who envisaged the still further stage of `mass  spiritualism'. With this mental background, our  rishis conceived of the `Old World State'.    "From sea to sea, over all the land, one State."    This is genuine globalisation. In its absence, the world  cannot go beyond the abortive experiments of the League of  Nations or the UNO.    Without the growth of such Hindu, i.e., human consciousness,  it is impossible in the international economic field to ensure  genuine `free trade', maximum utilisation of the scarce  resources, development without environmental problems and  permanent damage to Nature; adjustment of the presently  unlimited human desires with the limited resources of the  planet; management of population explosion; diversion of all the  huge amounts allocated currently by different countries for  their defence budgets to their developmental activities;  encouragement to every country to maximise its specialised  production; free exchange of scientific and technological  information; constitution of International Technological  Ombudsman; curbing the activities of international criminal  gangs disturbing seriously the economic structures of even the  civilised countries; and world peace, harmony and prosperity.</p>

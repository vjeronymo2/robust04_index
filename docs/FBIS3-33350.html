			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 19 Feb (NA) -- On 18 February, Pablo  Challu, executive director of the Argentine Industrial Center of  Pharmaceutical Laboratories (CILFA), emphasized that if the law  on pharmaceutical patents is approved it does not necessarily  mean that Argentina will be able to join NAFTA, as U.S.  Ambassador James Cheek has indicated.    Challu reiterated his warning that if Congress approves the  patents law the United States wants, the prices of medicines  "will go up 300 percent."    He explained that CILFA, the umbrella organization of  Argentine pharmaceutical laboratories, disagrees with Ambassador  Cheek about this condition he is trying to impose because "first  the terms on which Argentina will be able to join NAFTA must be  established."    Challu was talking about Ambassador Cheek's statement to the  effect that congressional approval of the law on pharmaceutical  patents was an essential requirement for Argentina to join the  trade agreement between the United States, Mexico, and Canada.    The pharmaceutical industry leader compared the ambassador's  conditions to "a theater where people are asked to buy their  ticket first and then it is decided whether they will be  admitted and under what conditions."    Challu also explained that CILFA "supports the amendment of  the law on patents," but the organization disagrees with the  U.S. ambassador "on two or three items" of the law.    "Cheek wants exclusive rights, that is, a monopoly for  companies that develop the products, and we believe it is better  to pay them royalties while retaining the freedom to market and  produce these products," Challu said.    He added that CILFA also disagrees with the length of time  the law will be in effect.    Challu stressed that the disadvantages consumers of  pharmaceutical products would face if the law on patents is  approved, such as significant price increases, is "a vital  issue."    He said: "Unlike the case in the United States, which has a  monopolistic system, free competition allows many companies to  produce the same goods. If there is only one company that  produces certain goods, it will be able to time the marketing of  its product to its own advantage."    One of CILFA's main arguments against the approval of the  law  on patents is the marked price increase that medicines will  experience if the law goes into effect.</p>

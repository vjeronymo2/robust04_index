			<p><P> March 6, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SOCKERS TRADE KARIC TO CRUNCH FOR WRIGHT  </P> <P> Paul Wright, a forward for the Cleveland Crunch who was claimed in last  summer's free agent draft after he was left unprotected by the Sockers, has  been traded back to the Sockers and will arrive Wednesday, Wright's agent Scott  Simpson said Monday.  </P> <P> According to sources, the Sockers have traded forward Zoran Karic in a  one-for-one exchange for Wright. Karic, the Sockers' leading scorer with 37  goals during the regular season last year, has had his share of differences  with Socker Coach Ron Newman during 2 1/2 seasons with the team. He has been  the subject of trade rumors since last summer.  </P> <P> Simpson said Wright called him last week and told him he had heard rumors of  the trade. Wright, Simpson said, was called by Cleveland General Manager Al  Miller Monday and told he had been traded to San Diego. Wright is under orders  from Simpson not to comment.  </P> <P> Socker owner Ron Fowler wouldn't comment either, saying only: "I think we're  very close to a deal."  </P> <P> Socker President Ron Cady, who sources said met with Miller in Tacoma Monday to  finalize the deal, also wouldn't comment but said he hoped to make an  announcement at today's Sportswriters-Sportcasters Assn. meeting at San Diego  Jack Murphy Stadium.  </P> <P> Socker Coach Ron Newman could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> In Karic, the Sockers have given up a proven veteran who has the ability to  score the elegant goal from outside the penalty box. Yet Karic, tied with  midfielder Waad Hirmez for the team lead with 22 goals, has often been a  selfish player, who rarely helps his teammates defensively. Karic, 28, leads  the Sockers in both penalty minutes (21) and shots-attempted (179).  </P> <P> Wright, who played sparingly last season but has 15 goals and 11 assists in 37  games this season, is just 20 years old, and is widely regarded around the  Major Indoor Soccer League as a future star because of his blinding speed.  Wright, who has a large following in San Diego where he played for Grossmont  High School, is a versatile player, who has 20 defensive blocks.  </P> <P> "I think we're getting something we don't have from Paul," midfielder Brian  Quinn said. "But we're giving up a player in Zoran that's done well the last  two years. I think Ron (Newman) and Zoran's personalties clashed. I don't think  anyone questions Zoran's ability."  </P> <P> The trade will allow the Sockers some breathing room with the $875,000 MISL  salary cap, which Fowler said the Sockers have pushed to the limit. According  to sources, Karic makes around $50,000, Wright around $30,000.  </P></p>

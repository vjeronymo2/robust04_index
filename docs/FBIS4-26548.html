			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 23 (XINHUA) -- Lu Ping, director of  the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council,  expressed the hope here today that the civil servants in Hong  Kong focus all their attention on their work and do not worry  about seniority with pay.    The seniority with pay has been stipulated clearly in the  basic law and there is also financial guarantee in this regard,  Lu said, referring to the idea that a fund be set up before  China resumes the exercise of power over Hong Kong in 1997.    With its promises on this and other matters, the Chinese  government will never try to shift its responsibility, Lu told a  visiting delegation from the association of the former senior  civil servants of Hong Kong, led by former secretary for land  and works Chan Nai-keong.    Hong Kong civil servants can continue their service after  1997, Lu said. Only the chief civil servants will have to be  nominated by the chief administrator of the Hong Kong Special  Administrative Region and confirmed by the central government,  which is designed to make the future government highly efficient.    During the meeting, Lu Ping also solicited opinions from the  group on the links between the future executive and legislative  bodies.    Some proposed that more Hong Kong civil servants should have  access to Chinese courses on the mainland to enable them to  learn more about it, with which Lu agreed.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Thailand's key economic indicators signalled  favourable performance during the first five months of this  year, creating the impression that the country's annual economic  growth target of 8 percent can be achieved according to  Government Spokesman Aphisit Wetchachiwa.    The results belie a general mood that the country's economy  is not performing as well as earlier expected as the inflation  figure is much higher than projected and investment has slowed.    The stock market, in particular has posted sluggish trading  activity since the beginning of the year, when the SET [Stock  Exchange of Thailand] Index plunged from its peak 1,700-point  level to the current level of 1,350 points. The market's  bearishness was partly attributed to the country's continued  political paralysis.    Mr Aphisit said after the Council of Economic Ministers  meeting that the overall picture of the Thai economy during the  period was favourable as exports, investment and tax collection  were in good shape.    Inflation was within manageable limits at 4.8 percent, but  Mr  Aphisit said that by the end of this year, the annual inflation  rate should not exceed the government target of 4.2 percent.    "We are trying to control inflation and if necessary,  monetary measures may be initiated to bring inflation to within  4.2 percent for 1994. There is now a tight liquidity problem in  the financial system because banks have lent much more than  deposits mobilised. Apparently, investment is improving," he  said.    During this period, a total of 362 projects valued at  144,635  million baht had sought promotional privileges from the Board of  Investment, representing a fair increase in terms of projects  and amount of investment to be made, compared to that of the  same period of the preceding year when there were 228 projects  applying for such privileges.    Mr Aphisit did not give the exact figures on how much those  projects would invest but said main investment was in the  construction and oil business and that Japanese investment  during the period doubled that of the same period in the  preceding year.    Applications for setting up new factories in the provinces  during January-May rose 74 percent over those in the same period  last year. Again, Mr Aphisit did not give the details on the  figures.    He said overall tax collection by the Government during the  period rose 15.6 percent, implying that economic growth should  reach the 8 percent target.    Thai exports in the first five months this year increased  21.4 percent over the same period last year reaching 421,800  million baht --accounting for 39.6 percent of the country's  export target forecast at 1,065,000 million baht, according to  Deputy Commerce Minister Chaiyot Sasomsap.    Mr Chaiyot, who quoted the Business Economics Department's  preliminary figures, said exports in the first five months  totalled 421,800 million baht, up 21.4 percent from last year's  347,567.8 million baht.    He said imports increased 10.1 percent from the same period  last year to 519,600 million baht. The imports increased at a  smaller rate because the country had imported crude oil instead  of refined oil.    Therefore, the trade deficit in the first five months  decreased by 21.3 percent to 97,800 million. The country's  trade deficit in the first five months last year was 124,318  million baht.    Mr Chaiyot said agricultural exports reached 72,000 million  baht, up 16.4 percent over last year, while industrial products  increased 19.7 percent to 284,200 million baht.    The major markets were still the traditional ones, including  the United States (up 11.8 percent), Japan (up 36.1 percent),  ASEAN (up 61.2 percent), particularly Singapore.    However, exports to the European Union increased by only 3  percent due to the slow economic growth in the union,  particularly in Germany.    Mr Chaiyot said Thailand had diversified its exports to  other  regions which have great potential, including Indochina (up 54.6  percent), the Middle East (up 8.4 percent), Eastern Europe (up  5.2 percent) and Australia (up 4.7 percent).    Garments were the largest export item valued at 36,500  million baht, up 3 percent from last year. The small growth was  attributed to problems exporting to the United States due to the  delay in the extension of a bilateral agreement.    The second largest export item was computers and parts  totalling 31,100 million baht, up 24.4 percent.    The third largest item was frozen shrimp totalling 19,000  million baht, up 50.9 percent over the same period last year.    For the period, Thailand exported gems and jewelry worth  18,000 million baht (up 4 percent), rice worth 16,900 million  baht (up 42 percent), integrated circuits worth 16,800 million  baht (up 20.7 percent), rubber worth 13,382 million baht (up 13  percent), plastic products worth 13,000 million baht (up 43.4  percent), shoes and parts worth 11,950 million baht (up 5  percent) and canned seafood worth 11,000 million baht (up 26  percent).    Mr Chaiyot said it is likely that the country's 1994 exports  will be higher than the target of 1,065,000 million baht as the  Government promotes exports by setting more trade centers and  commercial counsellors' offices abroad.</p>

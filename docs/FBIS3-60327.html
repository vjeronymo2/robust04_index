			<p>Language: <F P=105> Norwegian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Oivind Loraas: "Snow in South Norway Is </F> Extremely Polluted"]    [Text] Grey-black snow has fallen over the southeastern  part of Norway over the last few days. Pollution from England  and East Europe has made the snow extremely acidic.    Tonsberg--The snow that fell over the southeastern part of  the country earlier this week was extremely polluted. At the  regional college at Bo in Telemark the pH value of the  precipitation measured 3.4. The pH value shows how much acid  there is in the water. The lower the number, the more acidic the  water.    "We took a sample of the precipitation on Thursday [2  December], after personally observing how dirty-grey the snow  was," says teacher Synne Kleiven in the Department of  Environment Protection at the regional college.    "The tests we made show that the pH value of the  precipitation was 3.4. The normal pH value of precipitation over  Telemark is 4.4. This means that the snow that fell this week is  10 times as polluted as normal. In a fishing lake anything alive  will die long before the water becomes as acidic as the snow was  this week."    Kleiven says the water has been filtered and great  quantities  of soot particles have been found. "The filter we used became  completely grey as we filtered the water," she says. There is a  layer in the snow almost 2 centimeters thick that is almost  completely grey. We think this is the snow that fell the night  before Wednesday.    "So far the pollution remains in the snow. The problem  arises  when the snow melts in spring. If this happens rapidly water and  rivers will get an acidic pollution shock that might result in  the death of fish and great damage to the environment," says  Kleiven.    The National Pollution Inspectorate (NPI) has also received  reports about the extremely acidic precipitation.    "We received the statistics from some 30 measurements  carried  out by the Norwegian Institute of Atmospheric Research (NIAR)  yesterday. The numbers show a concentration of acid that is up  to five times the normal amount in the precipitation that fell  this week," Chief Engineer Tor Johannessen of NPI says.    "The measurements show a pH value ranging from 3.4 to 3.9 in  the snow that fell last week. This is far below the normal  value. The tests also show large concentrations of soot  particles," says Johannessen.    Johannessen says that the acidic precipitation has fallen  all  over the southeastern part of the country, from the Agder  counties to as far north as Osen in Hedmark.    "Periods with an extreme amount of acidic precipitation are  something that we experience from time to time," he says. This  is no acute crisis, but it might result in a large amount of  local pollution when the snow melts. It might be especially bad  if large amounts of acid collects in the snow during the winter.    The fact that there is so much soot in the snow indicates  that the pollution is coming from East Europe where cleaning of  emissions is quite poor. According to the Meteorological  Institute the precipitation of the last few days has come from  both the southeast and the southwest. This means that large  amounts of pollutants have come down over Norway from both East  Europe and England during the last days.  <H5>  [Box, p 3] </H5> <H5>  This Is Acidic Precipitation </H5>    -  Acidic precipitation is polluted snow or rain. It is first  and foremost sulphur that pollutes, but there can also be large  amounts of soot particles in the acidic precipitation.    -  The pollution is coming from heat-generating stations and  industries that use oil or coal as a source of energy. Sulphur  is released into the air and then comes back down as sulfuric  acid along with the precipitation.    -  England, Germany, Russia, and the other countries in East  Europe are the greatest users of coal and oil.    -  The Agder counties and Telemark in particular have been hit  by  acidic precipitation, but such pollution has been registered as  far north as Sogn and Fjordane.</p>

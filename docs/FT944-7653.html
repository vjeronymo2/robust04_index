			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Attwoods hits at multiple in last BFI deal Attwoods yesterday sought to convince shareholders they should reject the hostile Pounds 391m cash bid from Browning-Ferris Industries of the US by claiming that the predator had paid a substantially higher price for its last major acquisition. Mr Ken Foreman, chief executive, said in a letter to shareholders: 'BFI's reference to an implied multiple for our US businesses of one times revenue conveniently takes no account of the implied multiple of two times revenues which it paid for its 50 per cent interest in Otto Waste Service (of Germany).' Mr Foreman added that comparable US waste management companies traded on an average multiple of 1.9 times revenue, before taking account of a premium for control. BFI is offering 116.75p per ordinary and 92p per preference share. It has promised to pay the 3.25p dividend proposed, to accepting shareholders.</p>

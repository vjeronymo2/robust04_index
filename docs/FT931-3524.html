			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Technology: Information superhighways The flagship of the Clinton technology plan is the development of 'information superhighways', a nationwide communications network. Building on a programme established in 1991 by legislation sponsored by Vice-President Al Gore when he was in the Senate, the scheme is an ambitious effort to 'jumpstart' the construction of networks that the administration says: 'have the same effect on US economic and social development as public investment in the railroads had in the 19th century'. Key elements of the plan include increased federal funding for R&amp;D in supercomputers, high-speed networking and software and a programme to subsidise the construction of networking linking schools, hospitals and libraries. Sensitive to charges that the programme is an example of 'high-tech pork', administration officials stress that the government will not award big contracts to one or two companies. 'We are trying to energise the private sector, create the competition that will ensure that the best technology gets out quickly and provide the leadership so that everyone is moving in the same direction,' says Mike Nelson of the Office of Science and Technology Policy. Already, there has been an enthusiastic response to the information superhighways proposal in Silicon Valley, according to Ed McCracken of Silicon Graphics. The local telephone and cable companies are accelerating plans to install high-speed lines. 'Potential uses of high-speed networks - in health, education and business - have become the subject of cocktail conversation,' he says.</p>

			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Cerus sells stake in L Joseph CERUS, the French holding company controlled by Mr Carlo De Benedetti, the Italian industrialist, has sold its 29.5 per cent stake in Leopold Joseph, the London merchant bank. Banque Dumenil-Leble, the Cerus-controlled financial institution which held the stake, is understood to have placed it at about 230p, compared with an unchanged closing price of 358p. Hoare Govett took the shares in a bought deal and placed them with several institutions. A 7.8 per cent stake went to Fleming Mercantile Investment Trust, and a similar holding to Gartmore. Refuge Assurance remains the largest shareholder with 29.99 per cent. Mr David Fletcher, joint chief executive, said Cerus had been a seller of the stake for some time. Cerus has been restructuring its financial interests. Last January it sold Banque Dumenil Leble (Suisse), its majority-owned Geneva-based fund management arm, to Banque Worms de Financement et d'Investissement.</p>

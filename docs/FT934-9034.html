			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Only electronic CVs need apply The New York Times has developed a high-tech way for job-seekers to apply for positions advertised in the newspaper. For Dollars 40 (Pounds 26.40) job-hunters register their CV on its FasTrak database, either by filling in a form, faxing off a written resume or entering the data electronically. Then if a job is advertised for which he or she wants to apply, the job-hunter authorises the CV to be sent to the advertiser by keying in the appropriate code, using a touch-tone telephone. The system has been developed by Information Kinetics, of Chicago. New York Times: US, 212 556 1234. Information Kinetics: US, 312 335 0787.</p>

			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AT ISSUE;  </P> <P> SHOULD WOOD ROOFS BE BANNED?;  </P> <P> YES;  </P> <P> MOST HOMES LOST TO FIRE SINCE 1961 HAD THEM  </P> <P> The City of Los Angeles has taken progressive steps to protect its citizens and  their property from brush and structure fires, especially in areas of high  winds, dense brush and native vegetation.  </P> <P> Of continuing concern in these areas are wood roofs, which have been identified  as being a major contributing factor in fires. Most of the 931 homes damaged or  destroyed in the City of Los Angeles during major brush fires since 1961 had  wood roofs.  </P> <P> Examples of fires involving wood roofs include Santa Barbara, 1977 -- 234 homes  destroyed; Anaheim, 1982 -- 362 apartment units; San Diego, 1985 -- 87 homes;  Pebble Beach, 1987 -- 31 homes, and Houston, 1979 -- 26 apartment buildings.  </P> <P> Further, during last December's Porter Ranch-Granada Hills brush fire, 16 of 17  wood roof homes on one street alone were damaged or destroyed. In every  instance, the wood roof surface was the first to ignite and in many cases  contributed to the fire exposure of other homes through radiated heat or flying  brands.  </P> <P> Although these roofs were not pressure-impregnated as required by the present  building code, adopted in 1982, they were treated by the hand-dip process,  which at one time was accepted by the city of Los Angeles in conformance with  the 1970 building code.  </P> <P> The failure of these roofs, which were less than 20 years old, raised a serious  question:  </P> <P> Will the pressure-impregnated wood roof provide an adequate level of fire  protection throughout the life of the roof?  </P> <P> The wood shake and shingle industry has developed several methods that have  improved the fire retardancy of wood roofs. However, the dry Santa Ana winds  subject even the new pressure-treated shakes and shingles to adverse conditions  not experienced during tests.  </P> <P> In addition, the test requires only a 10-year natural weathering test for wood  shakes or shingles. This is not an adequate testing period, because most wood  roofs in Southern California will last between 20 to 30 years.  </P> <P> So far, approved pressure-impregnated wood roofs have passed only the five-year  natural weathering test; the 10-year test is scheduled for 1992.  </P> <P> There is existing residential development in the mountains and  high-wind-velocity areas in the city that interface with brush, and there will  be development there in the future.  </P> <P> The effectiveness of the Fire Department is extremely compromised in these  areas, which typically have a limited water supply and limited access.  </P> <P> Fires that ignite roof brands and winds that propel these burning roof  fragments ignite spot fires several blocks away from the original source.  </P> <P> Because of these conditions, wood shake or shingle roofs should be banned in  the mountain fire districts, fire buffer zones and restricted roof zones of Los  Angeles, which cover those parts of the city that experience increased fire  danger due to climate, geography and topography.  </P> <P> Furthermore, when more than 10% of a roof in these restricted areas is  replaced, the entire roof would be required to be brought up to code.  </P> <P> Finally, wood shake or shingle roof covering systems in use in all other areas  of the city must undergo and satisfactorily pass fire-retardancy tests for a  period of 20 years to retain approved status as a roof covering.  </P> <P> This potential of igniting roof surfaces and producing flying brands will  continue to be a major contributing factor in the spread of fires unless a ban  on new wood roofs is passed. The citizens can no longer afford the risk that  wood roofs in mountainous, windy areas impose.  </P> <P> READER IDEAS FOR AT ISSUE  </P> <P> Readers who have ideas on topics they would like to see explored in At Issue  should send them to Real Estate Editor, Los Angeles Times, Times Mirror Square,  Los Angeles 90053.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 22 KYODO -- The Posts Ministry's  latest decision to change its policy on format of the  next-generation television system has the Trade Ministry  baffled, a senior trade ministry official said Tuesday [22  February]. The new policy would not serve anyone's interest in  Japan, said the official at the Ministry of International Trade  and Industry (MITI) who declined to be named.    The electronics industry was plunged into confusion when a  senior official at the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry on  Tuesday unveiled a plan to switch from an analog system to a  digital system in the format of razor-sharp high-definition  television (HDTV). The Posts Ministry has supported the analog  system developed by Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK), and the  electronics industry has invested huge sums of money into its  development.    The sudden policy change is "unconvincing" and all segments  of Japan -- NHK, electronics makers, retailers and consumers --  will be affected negatively, the MITI official said.    Akimasa Egawa, director general of the Broadcasting  Administration Bureau at the Posts Ministry, announced the  switch at a news conference, explaining that NHK's adherence to  the analog HDTV system could spawn a new source of trade  friction. NHK has been experimenting with analog HDTV  broadcasting, known as hi-vision, since 1991, and consumers have  purchased hi-vision televisions.    The sudden move toward a change in high-definition TV system  standards took consumer electronics companies by surprise,  leaving them worried about a possible drop in sales of the HDTV  systems now on the market.    "It's certain that sales of the existing products (based on  NHK's analog system) will drop," said an official at Sony Corp.  Sony and other electronics companies have been betting on the  analog HDTV's success to provide them with a long-awaited hit  product.    "Our industry as a whole has invested some 300 billion yen,"  said an official at one major electronics company. But the  official and others noted that a shift toward a digital HDTV  system will be a benefit in the long run and it is not so hard  for them to go after such a system.    If HDTV standards are unified into a digital system, it  could  save time and money needed to develop different systems and the  benefits of mass production could be expected, the official said.    "If there is a change in standards, we will be able to  respond to it with the development of a decorder for a digital  system," said an official at Toshiba Corp.    NHK itself reacted with anger to Egawa's remarks, saying  they  hinder the promotion of HDTV systems and run counter to audience  expectations. "Mr. Egawa's remarks, which imply a review of the  muse system, hinder the progress of hi-vision promotion, spoil  the efforts hitherto made by the concerned parties, run counter  to audience expectation, and are thus very regrettable," NHK  said in a statement.    "Nhk will promote hi-vision as ever, respecting the report  by  the Radio Regulatory Council to the Minister of Posts and  Telecommunications published last May, such that the council  considers...The muse system as the proper broadcasting system of  HDTV in Japan in the post BS-3 broadcasting satellite era," the  statement said.    A senior official at NHK, which has been aggressively  promoting the analog-based hi-vision system, branded Egawa's  remarks as a personal view. "They are a personal opinion by the  director general rather than the view of the ministry," the  official said.  NNNN</p>

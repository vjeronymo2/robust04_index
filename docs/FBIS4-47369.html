The other constants are known with  an error not greater than 1 x 10[.sup]-6[/], but the most  optimistic estimate of the error in determining G is 1 x  10[.sup]-4[/]. Despite the innumerable studies of G, there is  still no explanation for the strong discrepancies between the  results of multiple determinations of G even with repeated  determinations by the same experimental method. In an attempt to  introduce clarity into this problem, an analysis was made of the  constraints on a theoretical model of representation of the  relative motion of trial gravitationally interacting bodies on  an artificial satellite which result in a low systematic error  level and provide a possibility for refining the gravitational  constant from measurements of the relative motion by two orders  of magnitude. Constraints related to the neglecting in the  theoretical model of relativistic corrections to the description  of the Earth's gravity field, neglecting of the zonal harmonics  of expansion of the Earth's gravitational potential beginning  with a harmonic of some particular number and influence of lunar  and solar tidal potentials are examined. The results clearly  indicate that considerable discrepancies in the results of large  series of G determinations in surface laboratory experiments may  occur as a result of the inadequacy of the used theoretical  model.

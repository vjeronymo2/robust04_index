			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PANEL OKS BILLS TO RESOLVE MONO BASIN WATER DISPUTE  </P> <P> Legislation designed to force the city of Los Angeles to resolve its  long-running dispute with environmentalists over Mono Lake passed a critical  test Wednesday by winning approval in the Senate Agriculture and Water  Resources Committee.  </P> <P> One bill, by Assemblyman Phil Isenberg (D-Sacramento), would fund $390.8  million in water projects, including $75 million for the establishment of an  Environmental Water Fund. It passed 7-3.  </P> <P> The second bill, by Assemblyman William Baker (R-Danville), requires the city,  the state Water Resources Department and the Mono Lake Committee -- an activist  group that has been fighting to preserve the Mono Basin -- to agree on a plan  for protecting the lake's ecosystem. Once agreement is reached, the bill says,  the city can be granted money from the new Environmental Water Fund which can  be used to help Los Angeles find replacement sources for water now diverted  from streams feeding Mono Lake. It passed 10-1.  </P> <P> The bills have been linked so that if one fails, so does the other. But a  representative of Gov. George Deukmejian asked the committee to split the  bills.  </P> <P> "It sounds to me," said Sen. Henry Mello (D-Watsonville), "that one would be  signed andthe other vetoed."  </P> <P> Department of Water Resources Director David Kennedy said the Administration  questions why the state "should help the city of Los Angeles do what the courts  have told it to do." The committee, however, voted to deny the Administration's  request.  </P> <P> Both bills had been stalled in the committee until both the city and the  Metropolitan Water District agreed to support them.  </P> <P> Ancient Mono Lake, in the Eastern Sierra near Yosemite National Park, has been  the focus of a political tug-of-war between environmentalists and Los Angeles  for decades. The controversy centers around the city's need to divert water  from the Mono Basin for millions of customers in Los Angeles and the  environmentalists' desire to protect the lake's ecosystem.  </P> <P> For years the environmentalists complained that the city's water diversions  lowered lake levels so dramatically that they endangered nesting and migratory  birds that inhabit Negit Island and brine shrimp that thrive in the alkaline  waters of the million-year-old inland sea.  </P> <P> City officials have steadfastly maintained that the diversions, which provide  one-seventh of Los Angeles' water supply, have not threatened the ecosystem.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, an El Dorado Superior Court judge held in a preliminary injunction  that the lake level must be raised by nearly two feet. City officials said the  effect of the ruling would be to force them to temporarily halt diversions,  since their Mono Basin storage system held only part of the water needed to  comply with the order.  </P></p>

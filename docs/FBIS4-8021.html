			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Bratislava PRAVDA in Slovak on 6 April  on pages 1 and 2 carries a 700-word Vladimir Jancura article  entitled "Zhirinovskiy Will Visit Bratislava." According to the  article, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, chairman of the Liberal  Democratic Party [LDP] of Russia, "will pay a private visit to  Bratislava from 16 to 19 May this year," at the invitation of  Bratislava businessman Ladislav Mojzis, 37, owner of the West  Club, a discotheque, cafe, and restaurant in the Koliba district  of Bratislava. Mojzis, who claims to be "Zhirinovskiy's friend  of long standing," tells the PRAVDA reporter that the visit  "will have an exclusively private character" and that "our guest  does not wish any contacts with political parties and mass  media." The date of the visit was reportedly arranged by Dr.  Jozef Lauko, another Bratislava resident and "friend of  Zhirinovskiy," during the recent LDP congress in Moscow, where  Lauko had been invited as "guest of honor." Mojzis claims that  he had known Zhirinovskiy "long before he became involved on the  political scene of the former USSR."    According to the PRAVDA reporter, Mojzis denies that he is a  member of the Slovak National Party "or any other party." He  also rejects the reporter's suspicion that the visit's main  objective is to promote his business. Although Mojzis concedes  that Zhirinovskiy will be staying in the West Club, he asserts  that "we do not need any advertising."</p>

Following this, KBS realized an exclusive interview with Israeli  Prime Minister Rabin, who is the negotiation partner of Chairman  'Arafat. In the interview with KBS, Prime Minister Rabin  revealed his views on the North Korean nuclear issue and  economic cooperation with the ROK. Correspondent Yi Hong-ki  reports from Jerusalem.    [Begin recording] [Yi] In an interview with KBS, Israeli  Prime Minister Rabin pointed out that North Korea is a dangerous  state, not only for the ROK but also for the Middle East. He  stressed that it is the responsibility of the international  community to check North Korea's provocative intention.    [Rabin] We look at North Korea as a great danger not only to  your country but also to the Middle East. North Korea does not  make any effort for the nonproliferation of weapons. It has even  long-range missiles. The North Koreans do not participate  in any international agreement in a practical way. To prevent  preparations of non-conventional weapons and long-range  missiles....    [Yi] Prime Minister Rabin said that the ROK's development  experience will be helpful to the economic development in the  Middle East, and hoped that the ROK will actively participate in  the construction and industrialization fields.    Prime Minister Rabin pointed out that the agreement on the  implementation of the Palestinian autonomy is aimed at opening a  new phase. Therefore, it is the most important issue for the two  sides to reach a satisfactory agreement, thus suggesting a  possibility of delaying the time of concluding the agreement.    [Rabin] Even though the time is important, the basic  question is to have an agreement with the Palestinians and with  the PLO that will bring about implementation, a good one.    [Yi] Prime Minister Rabin said that no fixed date has been  designated for the withdrawal of the Israeli Army from the  planned Palestinian autonomous area but only a goal is set for  the withdrawal at an appropriate time. Therefore, the deadline  for the withdrawal of 13 April is not likely to be the important  issue of dispute. [end recording]</p>

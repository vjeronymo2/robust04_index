			<p><P> June 27, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> IRVINE ASKS NEW STATE PROGRAM TO AID IN CONTROLLING MEDFLY  </P> <P> The City Council on Tuesday adopted a resolution asking the state to establish  a long-term plan for controlling the Mediterranean fruit fly in the event that  the pest returns to Orange County and threatens the city's agricultural  business.  </P> <P> The council also endorsed a resolution urging the California League of Cities'  Orange County division to back its position.  </P> <P> "This is a document that could really lend itself to an improvement in state  and local policy," Mayor Larry Agran said. "To date, most of the action by  localities has been futile, as a legal matter, to stop the spraying."  </P> <P> The resolution, based on a report by a council-appointed task force on  malathion spraying, criticizes the state's plan of declaring a state of  emergency after Medflies are spotted. Instead, the state should have an ongoing  plan of attack, the resolution states.  </P> <P> It further accuses state officials of mismanagement and charges that supplies  of sterile Medflies, used to breed the pest out of existence, are inadequate  for future infestations. The resolution also states that recurring infestations  show that government efforts to prevent the spread of Medflies are "wholly  inadequate."  </P> <P> "The state needs to know their program is in shambles and that the people don't  have any confidence in it at all," said Peter Navarro, a UC Irvine professor on  the city's task force.  </P> <P> To solve problems identified by the task force, the resolution suggests that  the state conduct research into safer eradication methods than the use of  pesticides. It also asks that the research be conducted by an independent  organization.  </P> <P> In addition, the resolution suggests that the state charge fees on affected  commercial and home agricultural products that could pay for research and  Medfly eradication programs.  </P> <P> Irvine officials also agreed to implement an education program for city  residents if Medflies should ever be discovered in Irvine's extensive  agricultural acreage. The program would warn people of the potential harmful  effects of malathion, how to protect themselves properly in an area being  sprayed and how to prevent the spread of Medflies.  </P> <P> The resolution endorsed Tuesday also asks that the state increase its education  and awareness programs in the same way.  </P> <P> Aerial spraying for the Medfly ended May 30. Although portions of Orange County  had been sprayed since November, Irvine was spared because no Medflies were  found there.  </P></p>

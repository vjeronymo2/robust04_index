			<p><P> August 19, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE WASTE BOARD AFFIRMS CURBS ON DUMPING AT LOPEZ CANYON  </P> <P> Despite Los Angeles city officials' claims that the action could shut down  their only city-owned trash dump, the California Waste Management Board voted  Friday to affirm a staff order calling for stricter limits on dumping at the  Lopez Canyon landfill.  </P> <P> Appearing before the state board, Los Angeles officials reiterated their  warnings that they will be forced to close Lopez Canyon landfill within days if  the state restrictions are enforced.  </P> <P> "The city is faced with a real crisis if it is forced to comply with this  order," said Assistant City Atty. John Haggerty. "The Bureau of Sanitation has  indicated they would only have a few more days of operation left."  </P> <P> </P> <P> "Chicken Little"  </P> <P> Opponents and neighborhood critics of the dump above Lake View Terrace,  however, cast doubt on the city's claim, saying it is tantamount to city  officials playing "Chicken Little" by issuing alarmist proclamations.  </P> <P> In fact, outside the boardroom, Haggerty and other officials conceded that the  closure would last three months at the most -- until the city could prepare  another area of the city-operated landfill for dumping. After that, the  landfill would be able to accept trash for another year.  </P> <P> "It's hogwash, and it's an irresponsible act on the part of the Bureau of  Sanitation to try to create panic and mold the public point of view," said Rob  Zapple, who lives near the northeast San Fernando Valley landfill and is a  frequent critic of it. "It's just infuriating all of us."  </P> <P> The board's staff on Aug. 2 rejected a more lenient order issued by Los Angeles  County and directly imposed state restrictions on trash dumping at Lopez  Canyon. The order called for cutting back the height of its garbage mounds from  1,760 feet to 1,725 feet and limiting the number of trucks that dump there  daily from 600 to 400.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lawsuit Filed  </P> <P> City officials are challenging that order in a lawsuit filed against the state  in Los Angeles Superior Court. Because the city has won a temporary restraining  order against the state, there is no chance that Lopez Canyon would be closed  before the next court hearing, scheduled for Aug. 31, Bureau of Sanitation  officials said Friday.  </P> <P> Chris Peck, the California Waste Management Board's spokesman, said Friday that  state board members have been aware of discrepancies in the city's assessment  of the impact of the enforcement order. He noted that the city never has  offered any proof that limiting operations at Lopez Canyon would result in  forced closure.  </P> <P> City officials defended their statements, saying they have merely tried to  prepare the public for the worst possible scenario. Plans to move into the new  area of Lopez Canyon -- a ravine that is currently unused -- still need  approval from the Regional Water Quality Control Board, Haggerty said.  </P> <P> "We can't assume that will happen," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mounting Trash Crisis  </P> <P> The section of the state's order that reduces the height of garbage mounds is  precisely what would force closure of Lopez Canyon Landfill and exacerbate the  city's mounting trash crisis, city officials maintain.  </P> <P> Because the trash heaps in Lopez Canyon are already higher than the state  height limits, the city would have to shut down the landfill to abide by the  order while they prepare the adjoining area for dumping.  </P> <P> Even after the new dumping area is ready, it too will fill up and result in the  dump's closure two years earlier than anticipated -- in 1990 instead of 1992,  city officials said.  </P> <P> They have estimated that rerouting the trash to private and public landfills  after that time would cost at least $26 million a year in disposal fees. Some  of that cost would have to be passed on to consumers.  </P> <P> Lopez Canyon accepts two-thirds of the city's residential trash. For years  neighbors have complained about odors, noise and dust at the site. But the  state's intense scrutiny of the dump began March 8, when two workers fainted  after unearthing a pocket of toxic gas produced by decaying trash.  </P> <P> On Thursday, the board threatened after 30 days to strip the county Department  of Health Services of its responsibility for enforcing health and safety  regulations at 83 dumps and trash transfer stations, partly because of the  county's unwillingness to crack down on Lopez Canyon.  </P> <P> Discussions of why the city is nearing a trash crisis always include mention of  the City Council's rejection of LANCER -- a waste-to-energy plant -- the slow  start-up of recycling programs and early closure of the politically unpopular  Mission Canyon, located in the Santa Monica mountains.  </P> <P> Peck said the waste board's intention is not to shut down Lopez Canyon but  rather to force the city to prepare for the future.  </P> <P> "It really comes down to long-term planning in Los Angeles, and they really  have not done that successfully," he said.  </P></p>

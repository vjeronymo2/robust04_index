			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Valeriy Demidetskiy and </F> Anatoliy Kholoyuk]    [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau] May 25 TASS -- Igor Smirnov,  leader of the split-way Dniester Republic, today accused  "definite political circles in Russia and Moldova of  economically blackmailing the Dniester Republic".    Addressing a session of the Supreme Soviet of his  unrecognised republic, he claimed that the said forces were  "deliberately destabilising the financial situation on the  left-hand bank of the Dniester River, striving to make Tiraspol  more tractable in the talks on the withdrawal of the Russian  14th Army and on problems linked with its property".    The Dniester parliament today discussed the acute money  shortage in the region. Tiraspol had refused to use Moldovan  leis on its territory and decided to leave in circulation the  Soviet money, annulled in all the CIS republics. This resulted  in the catastrophic destabilisation of the financial system and  led to the growth of inflation.    "The 60 billion roubles now in circulation are not enough to  meet current expenses," Chairman of the Dniester Bank Vyacheslav  Zagryadskiy told the parliament. He said that the government  should deliver to Tiraspol the new money printed in Russia for  the Dniester region. But "this cannot be done now due to the  ban imposed by the Russian leadership," he noted.    The Dniester parliament decided to address an appeal to the  Russian president, the State Duma and the Council of the  Federation, asking them to help the Dniester administration  solve the problem of cash money.</p>

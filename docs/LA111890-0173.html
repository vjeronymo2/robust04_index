			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FULLERTON HITS BOTTOM AGAINST NEW MEXICO ST.;  </P> <P> BIG WEST: TITANS ARE ROUTED, 43-9, BY AGGIES, WHO END THEIR 27-GAME LOSING  STREAK.  </P> <P> Cal State Fullerton hit ground zero Saturday, losing to New Mexico State, 43-9,  and snatching the title of "Worst Division I-A Team in America" from the  Aggies' mantel.  </P> <P> New Mexico State was ranked 106th out of 106 Division I-A teams by The  National, an all-sports publication. The Aggies surely will vacate the bottom  spot, and Fullerton, which entered at No. 105, has the U-Haul in the driveway  and is ready to move in.  </P> <P> "This is about as low as it gets," Titan defensive back Terry Tramble said.  </P> <P> Added Fullerton kicker Phil Nevin: "It's embarrassing."  </P> <P> A crowd of 19,227 in Aggie Memorial Stadium saw New Mexico State (1-10) score  24 fourth-quarter points to break open a 19-9 game. Aggie quarterback David  Chisum, a former Sunny Hills High and Fullerton College standout, completed his  first 11 passes en route to a 19-for-31, 288-yard, two-touchdown performance.  </P> <P> That helped New Mexico State snap a 27-game losing streak, which dated back to  Oct. 1, 1988. It was the Aggies' first victory at home since Oct. 24, 1987, and  their first Big West Conference victory since they beat Fullerton in 1986.  </P> <P> It was the first time since the second game of the 1983 season, when New Mexico  State beat Louisiana Tech, 15-7, that the Aggies held an opponent under 10  points.  </P> <P> New Mexico State entered with the nation's longest current Division I-A losing  streak. The Titans, who have lost 11 in a row since a season-opening victory  over Sonoma State, left with longest current Division I-A losing streak.  </P> <P> "I'm not happy about it," Titan Coach Gene Murphy said. "I'm a competitive son  of a . . . and as long as you're a player or coach, this better eat you up  inside."  </P> <P> First-year New Mexico State Coach Jim Hess may have felt more relieved than  elated.  </P> <P> "It was a tremendous burden every time we read in the paper that we had the  longest losing streak," Hess said. "It feels very good to pass that on to  someone else."  </P> <P> After beating Fullerton in 1986, then-New Mexico State Coach Mike Knoll led the  Aggies on a victory lap around the stadium. But that was tame compared to  Saturday's postgame celebration.  </P> <P> New Mexico State fans tore down both goal posts and carried them around the  field. The Aggies' victory bell, which had been collecting dust for two years,  rang loud and long afterward.  </P> <P> Those weren't the only strange occurences in Aggie Memorial Stadium, though. In  what had to be an unofficial school record, New Mexico State was penalized  twice, for excessive celebrations in the end zone after fourth-quarter  touchdowns.  </P> <P> And the Aggies' defense, which had six sacks in 10 previous games, made four  appearances in the Titans' backfield, sacking Paul Schulte four times for a  loss of 28 yards.  </P> <P> New Mexico State rolled up 514 yards in offense.  </P> <P> "There's a difference between being last in your conference and last in the  country," said Fullerton offensive lineman Mike Simmons. "But that's the title  we hold. It hurts, and it's a tough thing to deal with, but sometimes things  happen like that."  </P></p>

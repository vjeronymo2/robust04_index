			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (18): Testing ground for Europe - UK Cable Networks Three years ago, the British government surprised the global telecommunications industry and delighted cable television operators by ruling that cable companies in the UK could build combined cable television and telephone networks. The decision not only ended the BT/Mercury duopoly, but gave the cable network builders a head start by banning BT from offering entertainment services over its telecommunications network for a decade. Overnight, Britain became the most liberalised cable television market in the world and a test-bed for cable telephony services. As a result cable companies - many US-owned - have piled into the market. 'Everyone is watching to see what happens in Britain,' says Mr Robert Rosenberg, a telecommunications analyst with New Jersey-based Insight Research. Allowing cable television companies to also offer cable telephony services provides them with an important early second revenue stream which some many analysts now believe will eventually overtake cable television revenues themselves. As Dataquest Europe noted in a recent report, 'In the early days of cable it was generally assumed that cable telephony would be a marginal activity with marginal costs . . . the situation has changed considerably - some operators are now seeing revenue streams which in some instances are rivalling cable TV revenue.' Ms Cathy Burrows of Dataquest believes the ability to provide telephony services has fundamental implications for the economics of the cable industry. Although small margins on residential telephony initially prompt the question: 'Is it worthwhile?' Dataquest believes the answer is an unequivocal 'yes,' because it provides cash to grow the business, lifts penetration rates and reduces churn. 'The main attraction is a combination of business and residential telephony,' says Dataquest. Cable TV alone is calculated to have an 8 to 10-year payback period but the addition of telephony halves the forecast payback period to between 4 to 6 years. It is calculations like these which have fuelled the recent boom in UK cable industry investment. So far, about Pounds 1.7bn has been spent building cable networks passing some 3m homes, part of a projected Pounds 10bn investment programme stretching into the next decade including Pounds 1.2bn in the current year. Even the decision last month by three UK cable operators, General Cable, Comcast UK Partners and TeleWest, the UK's largest cable company, to postpone stock market flotations because of market conditions is unlikely to put a break on UK cable industry investment - although it may give encourage slightly more conservative valuations. Altogether more than 130 cable franchises have been awarded in the UK and 62 are already active with a total of about 650,000 subscribers. Network operators in the UK claim cable telephony provides both residential and business customers with substantial savings on call charges - typically between 10 and 20 per cent - as well as other advantages including itemised monthly billing. Companies market cable and telephony services together, often with discounts for customers taking both. But as Dataquest noted the popularity of cable telephony services has surprised even the operators. In some areas the take-up of cable telephony services is running at more than 50 per cent. By the end of March, 46 cable franchises had installed almost 350,000 telephone lines - including 38,000 business lines - in more than 30 areas, according to the Cable Television Association. A year earlier the figure was 126,500 lines including 18,000 business lines. The association predicts that exchange line connections will rise to more than 700,000 this year. Even then with more than 20m lines, BT's dominance of the UK telecommunications market is not immediately threatened. But together with Mercury marketing its long-distance network to residents, cable operators do appear set to make a significant dent in BT's market share. Dataquest forecasts that business and residential customers for cable telephony will be renting 1.5m telephone lines out of a total of 29,3m on the public switched telephone network in 1997, representing five per cent of the market and will generate annual revenues of almost Pounds 700m Other research from Barclays de Zoete Wedd suggests that by the year 2000 cable could be costing BT up to Pounds 1bn a year in lost revenues. BT is expected to recoup some of that lost revenue in charges for linking cable systems into its trunk network, but it will be competing for business with Mercury and other new long-distance telephone companies, including Energis, the National Grid subsidiary, and perhaps even the cable companies themselves. The cable companies have already announced plans to build the backbone of a national telecoms network to rival those of BT and Mercury in the UK by mid-1995. They plan to create six regional networks covering London, the Midlands, the north, East Anglia, the south coast and Scotland. Fibre-optic and microwave links will permit the companies to run joint programming and send regional telecom traffic across each other's networks without having to use BT or Mercury. Payments to BT and Mercury represent the largest telecoms cost of the cable companies so the cable companies want to cut their interconnection requirements to a minimum. For the moment it seems likely that the UK will remain a unique test-bed in Europe for the cable telephony market. As Dataquest notes, the regulatory environment is so different in the UK from the rest of Europe that there is little chance that other countries will allow cable TV voice telephony in the next five years. Some data communications services are allowed over cable in France and there is pressure for similar concessions in other countries including the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark. Mr Karel Van Miert, EU competition commissioner, last month threw his weight publicly behind a full and speedy liberalisation of Europe's cable television infrastructure. However the commissioner, outlining the role of competition policy in telecommunications, said his aides were studying the impact of allowing cable TV companies to offer services already open to competition but ruled out consideration of voice telephony, In contrast pressure is building in the US to follow the UK's lead and allow cable companies to offer telephony services and vice versa. Already so-called competitive access providers have been growing quickly competing against the local Bell companies to provide businesses with access to the long-distance carriers. Now, with the backing of Congress, the US regulatory structure looks set to loosen further.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------    UK customers pay less for phone lines: Italian callers pay most Four European countries compared: average cost per line in equivalent                           1994 UKPounds*  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                   1988    1989    1990    1991    1992    1993    1994  --------------------------------------------------------------------- UK - Mercury     1,837   1,814   1,724   1,644   1,520   1,456   1,480 UK - BT          2,209   2,177   2,106   1,977   1,688   1,601   1,625 France           2,686   2,149   2,103   2,057   2,039   1,984   1,771 Germany          2,588   2,597   2,335   2,104   2,065   1,943   1,938 Italy            3,555   3,539   3,386   3,140   2,903   2,794   2,609  --------------------------------------------------------------------- *For 100-line business customer - see also charts on Page Two of this survey.

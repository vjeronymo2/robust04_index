			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Nestle On the face of it, Nestle's 8.7 per cent increase in 1991 pre-tax profits was unremarkable. But it seems likely that the group took an as yet unstated restructuring charge of nearly SFr500m above the line, double the charge a year earlier. Adjusting for that, profits were 14 per cent higher after sales growth of 9 per cent and a volume improvement of 4 per cent. Such a performance suggests Nestle can afford a relaxed attitude should its bid for Perrier fail. In the more likely event of success, it will generate additional earnings from the combination of its Vitel mineral water brand with a Perrier business which has plenty of room for improvement. The extensive restructuring in the US and UK is almost complete, so this year's profits should be relatively clean. Although Nestle's shares are near their all-time high, they are on a prospective multiple of just 12. For investors comfortable with Swiss standards of disclosure, that looks a distinctly inadequate reflection of their promise.</p>

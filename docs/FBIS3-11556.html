Prior to Walker and Garcia's arrest, several members of the  third U.S.-Cuba friendship caravan crossed the U.S.-Mexican  border with a satellite communication system and several other  electronic supplies. (Errol Edwards), coordinator of Pastors for  Peace, stated that the significance of the event was not the  fact of having transported the equipment from the United States  to Mexico, but that it represented the weakening of the U.S.  blockade against Cuba.    The members of the caravan, headed by Walker, returned to  Laredo from Havana where they handed the Martin Luther King,  Jr., Memorial Center a donation of more than 140 tons of  humanitarian aid collected in more than 100 U.S., Canadian, and  Mexican cities.</p>

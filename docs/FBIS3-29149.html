			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Tokyo, Feb. 15 KYODO -- The U.S. dollar opened  at 102.32 yen in Tokyo on Tuesday [15 February], for its first  fall below 103 yen in Tokyo since last August. [passage omitted  on exchange rates] Some dealers reported the Bank of Japan was  selling the yen to shore up the falling dollar.    The dollar's plunge follows the overnight trend in New York,  where the U.S. currency plummeted to 101.10 yen at one point,  nearing the record low in New York of 100.85 yen set on August  17.    Dealers said market participants are betting on the yen  rising further as the U.S. Government is likely to seek a  stronger yen as a means of redressing the chronic trade  imbalance between Japan and the United States.    Expectations of a stronger yen emerged after Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton failed to  resolve a trade row at their weekend summit in Washington.    Dealers said comments by Laura Tyson, chairwoman of the U.S.  Council of Economic Advisers, also helped spark the  dollar-selling.</p>

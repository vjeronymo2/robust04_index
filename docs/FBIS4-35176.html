			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Haitian employers are going to institute legal  proceedings in the United States against the latest sanctions on  Haiti by President Bill Clinton. This is what Raymond Roy,  president of the Haitian Chamber of Commerce and Industry  [CCIH], said. The legal action is directed especially at the  list of 237 persons whose accounts have been frozen. Those  people include a handicapped person, who was the victim of  political violence; children; and deceased persons, asserted the  CCIH, which has called on Haitians to mobilize. Roy described  those sanctions that also limit transfers from Haitians living  abroad to their deprived relatives in Haiti to $50 per person  and per family as illegal. Criticizing the position of the  United Nations in the Haitian crisis for letting itself be led  by the United States, Roy pointed out that the Haitian  employers' organizations were going to write to UN Secretary  General Butrus Butrus-Ghali to denounce those measures. Let us  listen to the explanations of Jean Luckenson:    [Begin Luckenson recording, in Creole] The country's  economic situation is very alarming, even moribund. Our  businesses are closed; the international community is  assassinating the Haitian people. In the next few days, we are  going to retain Haitian and foreign lawyers in order to try to  attack the U.S. Government's unfair and criminal executive  order. Clinton is wrong. Such a measure should be taken by the  United Nations. I was quoting from CCIH President Raymond Louis  Roy following a meeting held by about 50 employers who are  members of an association of Haitian employers and  industrialists. The meeting, held on Tuesday 28 June at 1130,  was held to discuss the latest measures taken by the head of the  U.S. Government on 15 June to force the military leaders to give  up power. Those measures were the freezing of the funds abroad  of those who support the putschists and the suspension of  commercial flights. [passage omitted]    The CCIH president severely criticized the latest measures  taken by the head of the U.S. Government. According to Roy, who  was wearing a white guayabera shirt with a button saying No to  Occupation on his chest, the international community wants to  bring about international genocide against the Haitian people.  The latest sanctions have spared no one. So, the avalanche is  under way, taking away all that it finds in its path no matter  whether it be trash, straw, grass, or what have you. The U.S.  Government took measures against all those who are supporting  the putschists. According to many observers, the CCIH members  have not been spared. [passage omitted]    Roy said they have analyzed the latest sanctions and are  looking for a solution so they do not end up in a grave. He  invited all staunch Haitians, who are the victims of the  international community's claws through the latest sanctions, to  a mass to be celebrated on 4 July to protest the embargo and  foreign occupation in Haiti.

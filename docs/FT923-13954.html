			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Jarvis Porter moves into beer mats with Pounds 8.5m buy JARVIS PORTER, which prints labels for spirits and consumer products, is moving into beer mat printing with the purchase of the promotional products division of James Wilkes, the specialist engineer which earlier this year fought off a hostile bid from Petrocon. Jarvis is paying Pounds 8.5m cash and taking on Pounds 2.9m debt within the division, which includes John Quarmby in the UK and Waterlomat in Belgium. These companies account for about a third of European beer mat production, estimated at 4.5bn units a year. Jarvis will pay for the acquisition through a placing and offer by Hill Samuel at 138p a share on a 3-for-8 basis. The issue will raise Pounds 11.97m to cover the acquisition, repayment of debt and costs. Jarvis's shares fell 5p to 143p while James Wilkes shares were unchanged at 124p. Mr Arthur Watt, Wilkes's chairman, said the sale was another step to reducing borrowings, as promised during the Petrocon defence. Following the disposal, gearing would fall from 164 per cent at the year-end to about 90 per cent, he said. The division accounted for about 25 per cent of Wilkes's turnover last year. The division made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.29m in the year to December 31 on turnover of Pounds 11.8m. However, this included a Pounds 567,000 management charge payable to Wilkes which Jarvis believes no longer necessary. All the shares were placed yesterday. Certain directors agreed not to take up the offer, and their shares have been placed firm with institutions.</p>

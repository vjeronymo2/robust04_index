In a statement it issued this morning, the PLO asked the  U.S.  and Russian cosponsors of peace, the permanent and nonpermanent  members of the Security Council, the European Union, the  nonaligned countries, the Islamic countries, and all the  international community to stop these dangerous crimes and  massacres against the Palestinian people. In addition, it asked  that international protection be provided immediately for the  Palestinian people.    The PLO asked the masses of the Palestinian people to be  careful and alert to these premeditated schemes, to confront  them in united rank, and to consider the coming three days as  days of mourning and general strike.    The statement notes that the Palestinian leadership will  follow up the situation on all levels in order to confront all  possibilities.</p>

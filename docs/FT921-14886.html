			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Observer: Eastern star Given that Dixons is Sony's biggest UK retail customer and sources roughly two thirds of its merchandise from Japanese-owned companies, it ought to be in a pretty powerful position when negotiating with its suppliers. However, it seems that simple buying power is not enough when dealing with Japan, so it has gone out and hired a well-connected Japanese businessman - 63-year-old Yasuo Ishizaka  - to be non-executive chairman of its Japanese subsidiary. Dixons' Mark Souhami hopes Harvard-educated Ishizaka, who spent 27 years with Mitsui &amp; Co, will tell him 'what the Japanese are thinking, as opposed to what they are saying'. Maybe so, but the appointment might have carried more weight if Ishizaka had been put on Dixons' main board.</p>

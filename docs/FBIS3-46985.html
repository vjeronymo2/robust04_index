It quoted him as saying Thursday, "I'm grateful to hear of  Japan's commitment."    In its Wednesday edition, a leading Japanese daily, the  ASAHI  SHIMBUN, quoted unidentified government officials as saying that  Japan has decided to "commit itself" to the regional forum after  the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) came into effect  on January 1.    Japan had been guarded in its support for EAEC, proposed by  Malaysia, because the United States, its major trading partner,  was against the idea, fearing it would be excluded.    Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed stayed away from  an informal summit meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic  Cooperation (APEC) forum in Seattle in November.    Alatas said a ministerial meeting in Singapore last year of  the Association of Southeast [Asian] Nations (ASEAN) agreed to  include the EAEC in the APEC framework. "So, the EAEC is not a  threat to the APEC," he said.    ASEAN had accepted the caucus as an economic consultative  forum, Alatas said, adding that APEC "more or less" agreed to  the East Asian forum.    Potential members of EAEC are the six ASEAN countries --  Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and  Thailand -- and China, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.    APEC comprises these countries plus Australia, Canada,  Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and the U.S.</p>

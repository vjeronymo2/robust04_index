			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Survey of The Computer Industry (4): Braced for storms - Japanese Manufacturers FOR JAPANESE computer makers, these are turbulent times. A diverse set of trends is causing stormy conditions in the industry - and those companies that fail to latch on to prevailing trends will inevitably suffer. Japanese computer giants, such as Fujitsu, Hitachi and NEC, are seeking to sell more mainframes just when customers are learning that networks of minicomputers, workstations and high-powered personal computers are often sufficient for the jobs at hand. Apple Computer and other American companies are carving out greater slices of Japan's computer market, due to aggressive sales strategies. Furthermore, Compaq Computer is finally gearing-up its sales efforts in Tokyo. These and other companies are seeking to gain ground by taking advantage of downsizing, (using many smaller computers to replace large ones). 'Due to the trend toward downsizing, not much recovery can be expected in Japan's mainframe market segment in the near-term,' says Barry Dargan, senior technology analyst at James Capel Tokyo. The slowing of Japan's economy and poor sales of semiconductors are two basic trends hurting the big Tokyo-based computer-makers. NEC and Fujitsu recently announced dramatically lower profit estimates for the fiscal year ended March 31. However, opportunities abound for those suppliers nimble enough to recognise such trends as the expected sales growth of laptop and notebook computers, featuring improved screens. For Japan's mainframe makers, the world has turned upside down because their prior strengths have become weaknesses. It simply is not possible for large companies to make nearly all computer components while selling product lines ranging from notebook/laptops to supercomputers. Fujitsu, described as the world's 'number two' computer-maker after its mid-1990 acquisition of ICL, is the typical Japanese vertically-integrated electronics colossus, producing everything from memory microchips to mainframes and supercomputers. Such all-encompassing know-how is a sore point as well as a strength, because it means the company could be slow to recognise promising trends that can be spotted by clever and agile entrepreneurs. Like IBM in the US, Fujitsu has found that it is too slow-moving due to its immense size. Despite problems in Japan, Fujitsu's California-based affiliate, Amdahl, is enjoying success in the US with its new line of mainframes. Also in the US, Fujitsu America is re-entering the supercomputer market. Computer market niches are rarely exploited by behemoths because corporate bureaucracies, such as those of Hitachi or Fujitsu, lack the nimble qualities of Sun Microsystems or Silicon Graphics. Bloated bureaucracies at Japan's 'big three' computer-makers are fixated on perceived needs to make nearly all hardware for computers, while also focusing on communications equipment and microchips (NEC and Fujitsu) and even nuclear-power plants, (Hitachi). Pressure on NEC, Fujitsu and Hitachi comes from many areas and with varying intensity. IBM Japan is proving adept at capitalising on the strengths of Japanese partners like Toshiba, with which it is developing liquid-crystal displays (LCDs) via a joint venture. IBM Japan is re-organising its labyrinthine structure with an emphasis on streamlining; the idea is to enable business sectors to act more like entrepreneurs. As for NEC, its main strength in the form of dominating Japan's personal computer market, with a slice of over 50 per cent, is emerging as a minor headache. Many other PC makers are slowly chipping away at NEC's dominant share of the Japanese market; and its mainframes and supercomputers are not IBM-compatible. Another weakness is NEC's tie with Groupe Bull, which has never amounted to much. In the US, NEC earlier this year linked up in supercomputer sales with Control Data, itself entrenched in a weak position. Hitachi appears to have the greatest weakness of all: it has been extremely slow to enter into joint ventures with American innovators, and cannot rely forever on its keiretsu business partners for computer sales. Hitachi is collaborating with Texas Instruments in developing 64-megabit dynamic random access memory (DRAM) microchips. Fujitsu, NEC and Hitachi are all feeling the pressure - not only from supercomputer pioneer Cray Research, but also from a number of US innovators. These include Thinking Machines and Kendall Square Research in the emerging market of massively parallel machines; and Convex Computer in the 'low end' of the supercomputer market. Also, in the massively parallel computer market, both IBM and Digital Equipment Corporation have made strong commitments to meet emerging customer-needs. While they try to protect market share in product lines as diverse as supercomputers, mainframes, workstations and laptop-notebooks, Fujitsu, NEC and Hitachi are eyeing the next promising data-processing market - that of pen-input computers. This up-and-coming market segment is gaining popularity in the US, but it is perhaps most promising in Japan. This is so because Japan's kanji writing system is not so easy to input via traditional keyboards. Many Japanese computer users would prefer to 'write,' rather than punch keys. Yet, so far, Japan's 'big three' appear slow to capitalise on pen-based computers. Another area that the Japanese giants covet is fault-tolerant computers, featuring back-up systems to prevent computer 'crashes.' For example, Fujitsu offers so-called 'Sure System" computers. But US companies such as Tandem Computers have established positions that they will not surrender without a battle. Fujitsu, the company that sells everything from semiconductors to supercomputers, accounts for only about 1 per cent of the global PC and workstation market, according to Dataquest. It is not as if Fujitsu lacks innovative qualities: its FM-Towns multimedia computer was the first PC to come with a CD-ROM (or compact-disk read-only memory). Despite the apparent weaknesses of the Japanese behemoths, owing to their 'we do everything' approach, research strengths in a few emerging technologies may eventually prove sufficient to boost their computer prospects.</p>

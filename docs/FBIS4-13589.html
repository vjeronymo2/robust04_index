			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] Gentlemen: The Israeli Government leaked  information to the media about draft proposals Prime Minister  Yitzhaq Rabin has received, which were worked out by the Israeli  Army on the principles of a settlement with Syria. These  proposals include a host of general principles, but they do not  address the depth of the withdrawal from the Golan or its  timetable.    The draft proposals speak about peaceful relations, security  arrangements, and normalization of ties. However, these  proposals do not include a pledge of full withdrawal. They call  for open borders, economic relations, a search for water  resources in the Golan, the demilitarization of areas, the  disarming of military forces, the creation of warning stations,  and the deployment of international forces.    Information was also leaked that the Israeli Foreign  Ministry  has, in turn, prepared a working paper on a settlement with  Syria. This working paper is independent from that of the Army.  Yitzhaq Rabin announced that Syria should hold secret contacts  with Israel because it is impossible to reach peace without such  contacts. Any observer who follows these drafts and proposals  can only wonder if Israel is really serious about making peace.    Syria presented a document of principles during the sixth  round of the Washington talks, which was hailed by the  international community as an objective and balanced paper that  lays the foundations of firm peace in the region. However,  Israel refused to discuss the sixth item of the document of  principles on the exchange of land for peace and the return of  the Golan. Israel inundated the Washington talks with an  endless series of security conditions and pretexts, as if the  Washington talks were held to provide security for Israel alone.    The Syrian negotiating team did not succeed--despite the  many  rounds and exhaustive efforts--in drawing the Israeli delegation  to discuss withdrawal from the Golan, although the occupied  territories are central to the Arab-Israeli conflict.    The Israeli settlement paper did not include anything that  refers to Israel's readiness to withdraw fully from the Golan.  The Israeli paper revolves around the achievement of great  gains for Israel -- such as relations, normalization, and  security arrangements. This confirms that there is no change in  the Israeli position and that their approach of procrastination  and maneuvering remains the same.    Syria is concerned with a just and comprehensive peace,  which  means the restoration of Arab territories and rights and  providing a chance for stability in the Middle East. Syria is  not at all concerned with being drawn into Israel's trap or its  security claims.    Israel is only raising these problems and security  complications in order to announce at the end that occupation of  part of the Golan is important for its security, although  occupation did not, and will not, provide security for Israel.  Just, entrenched, and honorable peace is the only thing that  will provide security and stability for the region.    Obviously, the game of the Israeli working papers -- one  from  the Army and the other from the Foreign Ministry -- is merely  another pretext to escape the obligations of the peace process,  primarily withdrawal from the Golan and all occupied territories.    The Washington talks have extensively addressed all items  related to peace, particularly security arrangements. However,  the Israeli side has consistently refused to discuss the  question of withdrawal. Had Israel truly wanted peace, the  question would not have taken all these discussions,  deliberations, and working papers. The Security Council  resolutions, the Madrid conference foundations, and the U.S.  initiative all stem from the exchange of land for peace. Is  Israel ready to return the land, the whole land? This is the  question that requires a frank answer. Without a frank and  decisive answer, there is no possibility for realizing peace in  the region. Syria is not willing to relinquish an inch of its  territory or any Arab right. Syria is also not willing to  exchange facts for illusions and to replace the Washington talks  and the foundations of the Madrid conference with secret talks  whose only objective is to circumvent the Security Council  resolutions.</p>

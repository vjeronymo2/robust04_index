			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Troops from the government and the Mozambique  National Resistance [Renamo] recently trained by British  instructors in Nyanga, Zimbabwe, returned to the country  yesterday. They are presently at the Dondo Military Training  Center in Sofala Province. Our correspondent Matias dos Amores  reports.    The 540 military instructors will train soldiers selected  from the government and Renamo armies to form units of the new  Mozambique armed forces, within the framework of the peace  process in the country. The Mozambican instructors who  travelled to Mozambique by road in UN vehicles, left the Nyanga  Military Training Center in Zimbabwe at 0730 [0530] yesterday  and arrived at the Dondo Military Training Center at around  1800. They were received by Lieutenant Generals Tobias Dai and  Mateus Ngonyamo, heads of the government and Renamo delegations  to the Joint Commission for the Formation of the Mozambique  Defense Armed Forces [CCFADM], respectively.    Lt. Gen. Tobias Dai said that with the end of the military  training course, part of the General Peace Accord has been  implemented.    [Begin Dai recording] Dear Mozambican finalists who have  just  concluded a military training course in Zimbabwe, on behalf of  the Mozambican government and as head of the government  delegation to the CCFADM, I would like, first of all, to thank  the people who have come here, some from very far, to witness  the arrival of Mozambican finalists from the Republic of  Zimbabwe where they were being trained by British and Zimbabwean  instructors. They have been here since this morning to see  their brothers who have just returned to the fatherland. To you  finalists, we say welcome to the fatherland, welcome to the  Republic of Mozambique. We say welcome in particular to the  Dondo Military Training Center which is the point of departure  for you to begin carrying out your tasks. [end recording]    Renamo's Lt. Gen. Mateus Ngonyamo said the presence of  government and Renamo troops in Dondo, after concluding their  military instruction course, marks the true steps toward  national reconciliation.    [Begin Ngonyamo recording] For me, I view your arrival, as  an  implementation of the objectives of peace and reconciliation.  As you can see, it is difficult to know who is the former  soldier of the Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] and who is  the former Renamo soldier. Here, we see a unit of military  instructors of the Mozambique Defense Armed Forces. This is the  foundation of our new army. We cannot have good units with good  soldiers, without good military instructors. [end recording]    Mateus Ngonyamo called on Mozambican politicians to follow  the example of the soldiers in the process of national  reconciliation, having guaranteed that despite [words  indistinct] politicians, the Angolan situation will not be  repeated in our country.</p>

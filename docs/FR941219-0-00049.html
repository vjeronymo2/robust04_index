Designating critical habitat for a species does not result in a management or recovery plan. Critical habitat simply identifies areas where conservation efforts should be concentrated. Designating critical habitat alone will not dictate how the delta smelt should be protected, nor will it require identification of goals to measure the success of the designation. Plans, goals, and directives will be identified and set in motion during the recovery planning process. Section 4(f)(1) of the Act specifies what should be included in a recovery plan. Criteria for downlisting or delisting are contained in recovery plans, which function as goals to achieve species conservation. The Delta Native Fishes Recovery Team has developed a draft Recovery Plan for the delta smelt and other estuarine fish species, and will include recovery and delisting criteria for the delta smelt. The public will have the opportunity to comment on a draft delta smelt Recovery Plan before it is approved as a final plan as required by section 4(f)(4) of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 31:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Senator Phil Wyman and The California Farm Bureau were disappointed with the quality of the public hearings held in Fresno because only the Service and the EPA attended the meeting to hear testimony and answer questions. The Senator and the Farm Bureau believed the Bureau and NMFS should have been at the hearing, since the issues involved ``Club Fed''. Moreover, several of the participants in Fresno felt the hearings were simply a ``going-through-the-motions'' exercise. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4(b)(5)(E) of the Act requires the Service to hold a public hearing if one is requested within 45 days of the publication of a proposed rule. The Service received such a request, and held hearings in Fresno, Irvine, Sacramento, and San Francisco to accept public comment on two proposals by the Service and on one proposal by EPA_the proposed critical habitat designation for the delta smelt, listing of the Sacramento splittail, and Bay/Delta water quality standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The hearings are not a ``going-through-the-motions'' event. Service staff review all oral comments presented at the public hearings from the hearing transcripts. Oral comments are given the same weight and consideration as are comments submitted in written form. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 32:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many commenters thought the Service should prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) required by NEPA, to comply with the holding in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Douglas County  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lujan.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These commenters thought the Service should assess the environmental and social impacts that may occur in or near the Estuary, and outside the Estuary area as a result of designating critical habitat for the delta smelt. Commenters identified potential environmental impacts, including groundwater overdraft and subsequent land subsidence, sagging canals and leaking rivers, fugitive dust, warming of reservoir water, impacts on regional water quality control plans, increased energy use, impacts on listed and candidate species, loss of water for wetlands, loss of open-space habitat provided by farms, and impacts on regional recreational use at reservoirs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The decision in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pacific Legal Foundation  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Andrus  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (657 F.2d 829) held that an EIS is not required for listings under the Act. The decision noted that preparing an EIS on listing actions does not further the goals of NEPA or the Act. The Service believes that, under the reasoning of this decision, preparing an EIS for the delta smelt critical habitat designation would not further the goals of NEPA, or the Act, and is not legally required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The United States District Court for the District of Oregon in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Douglas County  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lujan  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> held that critical habitat designations should be analyzed under NEPA. However, the decision is stayed pending appeal to the Ninth Circuit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, see the discussion in this rule respecting NEPA compliance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 33:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter thinks the Service violated the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) because it relied on scientific information developed by the San Francisco Estuary Project (SFEP) in developing the revised critical habitat designation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4(b)(2) of the Act specifies that ``The Secretary shall designate critical habitat *&blank;*&blank;* on the basis of the best scientific data available *&blank;*&blank;*.'' When the Service identifies critical habitat, it relies on scientific data in published literature, data gathered as a result of status reviews, data received during the public comment periods, and information communicated in conversations with biologists, economists and other specialists. A summary of the findings of the SFEP (1993) was included in the body of information that the Service used to revise the proposed rule to designate critical habitat. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Critical habitat for the smelt was first proposed in October, 1991. The Service revised the critical habitat boundaries in 1994, relying on the best scientific information available from California Department of Fish and Game biologists, Service biologists, and new scientific information received during the public comment period from the EPA and other commenters. Included in this information were the findings and recommendations of the SFEP. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Had the Service not used SFEP information, the Service would not have complied with section 4(b)(2) of the Act, which requires use of the best scientific evidence available. SFEP was created in 1988 as part of EPA's National Estuary Program. The SFEP is an Environmental Management Program of EPA, the State of California and the Association of Bay Area Governments. The Service has participated in the SFEP extensively over the past several years. The SFEP developed recommendations for estuarine standards, and complied with FACA when they conducted workshops and meetings, and when they chose participants to work on the standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

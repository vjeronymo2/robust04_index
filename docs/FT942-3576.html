			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Hunters look for choicest morsels: With fee income static, UK accountancy firms may have to make big changes in strategy Stagnant revenues, job cuts, growing competition: the latest snapshot of trends affecting the UK's leading accountancy firms highlights the likelihood of a widespread restructuring in the profession. Data from the top 30 firms published last week reveals total fee income of Pounds 3.4bn was all but static in 1993-94 compared with the previous year. Half of the top firms reported a decline in revenues, including Touche Ross, one of so-called 'big six' firms, which fell 0.8 per cent to Pounds 332.9m, taking it from fifth to sixth place in the accountancy league table. 'It's been a very, very difficult year,' says Mr Nick Land, managing partner of Ernst &amp; Young, which dropped from third to fourth place despite raising fee income 3.8 per cent to Pounds 388.4m. 'It's still very hard out there. A lot of my managers are very cautious looking forward. It's very competitive.' The gloom might have been worse without the counter-cyclical income from insolvency work. Economic recovery is now cutting that source of revenue but has not yet proved sufficiently strong to ensure a return to the high growth rates in audit fees that the firms experienced in the late 1980s. Faced with these pressures, in the past two years accountancy firms have begun cutting jobs and other overheads. The number of partners has dropped by 7 per cent in the past 12 months and the number of other professional staff whose work is charged to clients by 6 per cent. 'I think all the firms have more cuts to make,' says Mr Ian Brindle, senior partner of Price Waterhouse, which dropped from fourth to fifth place after reporting almost unchanged revenues of Pounds 384.6m for 1993-94. In spite of such pessimism, the figures do not tell the whole story and have to be read with caution. The firms only reveal the gross revenues received from clients. As partnerships they are not obliged by law to reveal their profits or losses, and currently they have no intention of waiving this right. It is also difficult to make comparisons between firms, given the different ways in which the information is collected and the growing diversification in the activities of the firms which has reduced the areas in which they are direct competitors. In particular, some of the larger firms argue that there is a glaring difference between themselves and Andersen, which comprises Arthur Andersen and Andersen Consulting, and which has jumped in the past two years from sixth to third position in the league table, with total fee income of Pounds 433.6m in 1993-94. Much of Andersen's income comes from its management consulting work and from 'out-sourcing' - the process of taking over and running contract functions such as computer, accounting and tax work that clients would previously have run in-house. Mr Peter Smith, chairman of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, unchallenged as the UK's largest firm with revenues of Pounds 560m, hints at a widespread feeling that Andersen should be seen as in a different sort of business: 'I don't see that it makes sense to aggregate high-level intellectually-based consulting services with hangers full of people running computers.' Andersen has been successful in exploiting the markets that rivals such as Price Waterhouse attempted to emulate to its cost during the late 1980s with a consulting arm that subsequently had to be restructured with substantial job losses. 'Let them (other firms) say whatever they want,' counters Mr Jim Wadia, Arthur Andersen's managing partner. 'We want to grow and succeed.' Part of Andersen's success is due to its ability to control overheads, the premium it pays to recruit the best graduates, the provision of high-quality training, and good management information systems. Other large accountancy firms are considering similar methods to boost their profitability. But if Andersen's rivals believe the prospects are as gloomy as they make out, they also face a number of strategic choices: whether to continue offering a broad range of professional services or to specialise in just a few; whether to offer high-fee advisory services or high-volume 'outsourcing' and similar products; and whether to serve a wide group of clients or focus on particular industrial sectors. Mr David Maister, a US-based consultant to professional firms such as accountants and lawyers, likens the large firms during the 1980s to the 'hunter-gatherers' of nomadic tribes, always roaming for new products. 'Everyone's job was to hunt buffalo, but when they saw a goose they thought 'just kill meat whatever it is'.' If one firm started offering a new service, the others felt they had to follow. This approach worked when volumes were growing rapidly, but there was little attention to longer-term strategy or the costs being built into operations. In the 1990s, Mr Maister warns that clients are becoming more cost conscious and more critical of services the firms provide. There is evidence that some firms are beginning to respond to such pressures. At KPMG Peat Marwick, the second largest firm with income of Pounds 497.6m last year, Mr Colin Sharman, senior partner, says: 'You can see quite clear differences emerging between the firms. We will focus more on the core services of audit, corporate finance and recovery (including insolvency and company restructuring), tax and business transformation consulting. We want to be seen as advisers.' KPMG has restructured the firm around teams of professionals with a range of skills serving particular industry sectors, rather than organised along traditional lines such as tax and consulting. Coopers is also in the middle of a wide-ranging re-organisation around industry groupings. Mr Sharman predicts that several of his large rivals, including Touche and Andersen, will offer a broader range of services such as out-sourcing, which may offer lower margins but which, because of the high volumes, can also be profitable if managed well. Mr Maister predicts that one of the large accountancy firms may within the next few years abandon auditing, while another firm specialises in nothing else to provide highest quality. 'Audit is low growth, low fee and brings a high risk of litigation,' he says. Mr Sharman is sceptical, however, pointing out that the statutory audit each year of British companies provides a launching pad from which firms can sell other services to the client. 'It's too much of an annuity stream to give up,' he says. While decisions about strategy are important for larger firms, they are still more pressing for their medium-sized rivals. The past few years have witnessed growing consolidation of the profession. Of the income generated by the top 30 firms, the 'big six' alone take 76 per cent. While there will probably always be scope for small high-street practitioners, there is a question-mark over the viability of 15 middle-ranking firms. Mr David McDonnell, managing partner of Grant Thornton, the seventh-largest UK firm, says: 'The current position is not sustainable. The 'big six' may become five or four but the next tier will reduce to maybe three or four firms within a few years.' The answer, he argues, is to specialise. The costs of remaining generalist providers will make mid-size firms' fees uncompetitive with smaller, high street rivals which have lower overheads and concentrate on a few basic services. Grant Thornton, for instance, has abandoned much of its work for larger clients, and is specialising in offering general business advice to fast growing companies. Other mid-size firms may either fold, or be forced to merge: either with each other, or - for the handful that still have large clients - with a big firm. One of the last of these - the combination of BDO Binder Hamlyn, the eighth-largest firm, with Andersen - is likely to be completed over the summer, in a move which will probably propel it to second place in the league table next year. Like, their larger counterparts, mid-size accountancy firms, are having to come to terms with the prospect of much more sluggish growth in the 1990s than they experienced in the past decade. This presents a particular challenge to the current generation of senior partners across the accountancy sector who have been used to management in periods of high growth, and only in recent years have faced stagnation. As Mr McDonnell of Grant Thornton says: 'We will have to adjust to the difficulty of operating for the long-term in a low-inflation, low-growth economy'.  -------------------------------------------------------------------                 UK ACCOUNTANCY FIRMS' FEE INCOME  -------------------------------------------------------------------                                            % of fee income from:                               % change              Mgement                      1993/94     on                 consul-  Insol- Firm               (pounds m) 1992/93   Tax   Audit  tancy   vency  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Coopers and Lybrand    560.0    +1.3     45     22     22     11 KPMG Peat Marwick      497.6    +1.4     40     22     14     10 Andersen               433.6   +11.7     19     16     58      7 Ernst &amp; Young          388.4    +3.8     43     28     18     10 Price Waterhouse       384.6    +0.6     41     28     22      9 Touche Ross            332.9    -0.8     40     23     21     12 Grant Thornton         107.0    -6.0     35     30      4     24 BDO Binder Hamlyn      106.5    -1.8     60     29      4      7 Pannell Kerr Forster    79.7    -4.1     46     24      6     16 Stoy Hayward            78.0    +4.4     48     21     11     20  -------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

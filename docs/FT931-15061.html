			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / (CORRECTED) Patronage determines who serves at the top Correction (Published 15th January 1993) appended to this article THE GROWTH in power and influence of quangos puts responsibility for many of the UK's public services in the hands of the unelected members of their boards. Since 1979 there have been numerous accusations that the Conservatives have used patronage to appoint Tory supporters to key quango jobs, particularly in health services. In the latest row Mr Ron Davies, shadow Welsh secretary, this week accused the government of 'deliberately stuffing public bodies and authorities (in Wales) with Tory placemen'. That follows the appointment last year of former Tory MP Mr Ian Grist - who lost Cardiff Central in the general election - as chairman of South Glamorgan health authority. Analysis by the the Financial Times of the chairmen of the 10 largest NHS quangos and the 30 largest non-NHS quangos in 1990-91 shows that, if they had an identifiable political affiliation, it was Conservative. None of the top 40 was a known Labour party member or Liberal Democrat, while eight were Conservatives. Among prominent Tories is the former Mr Nicholas Edwards, now Lord Crickhowell, a former Welsh secretary. He now chairs the National Rivers Authority; and Mr David Mitchell of Cumbernauld Development Corporation, who is treasurer of the Scottish Conservative party. Sir Bryan Askew, who chairs Yorkshire Regional Health Authority, was a Conservative parliamentary candidate. The last Labour government also used its patronage powers to appoint supporters to key posts in top quangos. Twelve of the top 40 chairmen in 1978-79 were Labour supporters, including Labour peers Lord Northfield and Lord Campbell. Supporters of other political parties also chaired top quangos. Three were known Conservatives and one a Liberal. There have been other changes in the type of people running top quangos in the 14 years since the Conservatives came to power. The most striking is the move away from appointing professional public-sector managers. Today's top quango chairman is much more likely to be a businessman - nearly two thirds of the chairmen of top 40 quangos in 1990-91 were from business and industry. It was one third in 1978-79. Some of those businessmen have headed large public companies. Sir Alistair Grant, chairman and chief executive of Argyll Group, is chairman of the Agricultural and Food Research Council. Sir David Nickson of Scottish and Newcastle Breweries, Sir David Plastow of Vickers and Sir Clifford Chetwood of George Wimpey also chair top 40 quangos. Others come from smaller businesses or have not headed their own company boards. Sir James Ackers, who last week resigned as chairman of West Midlands regional health authority, the biggest-spending NHS quango, ran a family truck-rental business which collapsed last year. Sir Bryan Askew is personnel director for brewers Samuel Smiths. The appointment of more businessmen has been matched by a fall in the number of chairmen who come from the 'great and the good'. In 1978-79, nine of the top 40 quangos were chaired by someone whose main occupation was serving on public bodies. Only two fell into that category in 1990-91, Baroness Cumberlege of the South West Thames RHA - who has since become a minister - and Mr John McEvoy, who chairs the Northern Ireland Housing Executive. The FT study also shows that the top 40 quango chairmen in 1990-91 were not representative of the people for whom they provided public services. They were overwhelmingly male, with only two women among the top 40. Of the 22 whose schools could be identified, 18 went to public schools. They were mostly university-educated, eight at Oxford or Cambridge. If there is a new elite running Britain's public services, as the European Policy Foundation alleges, it appears the best qualifications to join are to be a businessman with Conservative leanings.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                    THE FT TOP 40 QUANGOS 1990-91  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- The 10 biggest spenders among the NHS quangos, plus the 30 biggest non-NHS spenders  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                   Expend-   Staff  Chairman                                    iture                                  Pounds m  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1  Universities Funding Council   1,849       99           Lord Chilver  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 2  W Midlands Regional            1,676   85,052       Sir James Ackers       Health Authority  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 3  North East Thames RHA          1,493   67,698       Arthur Chessells  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 4  Trent RHA                      1,451   75,692   Sir Michael Carlisle  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 5  North Western RHA              1,395   70,953           Bruce Martin  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 6  South East Thames RHA          1,314   61,188      Sir Peter Baldwin  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 7  North West Thames RHA          1,237   51,758    Sir William Doughty  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 8  Yorkshire RHA                  1,165   58,476        Sir Bryan Askew  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 9  Polytechnics &amp;

The regional and district health authorities in England and Wales, the Scottish health boards and the Northern Ireland health and social services boards make up more than half the 40 biggest spenders among public bodies. To make a representative selection of the different fields covered by quangos the FT top 40 combines the 10 largest national health service bodies and the 30 largest non-NHS bodies. The key appointment in most quangos is often the chairman. He or she is usually the most influential board member in determining policy and appointing top executives. The chairman may also be consulted on the appointment of the rest of the board and may act as a policy adviser to the minister whose department is responsible for the quango.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- CORRECTION SIR David Plastow is no longer chief executive of Vickers, as stated yesterday. Since September 1992, he has been chairman of Inchcape.</p>

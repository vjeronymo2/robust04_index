			<p>BFN     [Text] Geneva, June 10 -- In his latest report, U.N. human  rights commission's envoy to former Yugoslavia Tadeusz  Mazowiecki accused Serbs of terror during their offensive on the  Muslim enclave of Gorazde last April. The report on human  rights in former Yugoslavia accuses Bosnian Serbs of  deliberately directing artillery fire on hospitals, performing  mass executions, expelling civilians, destroying houses and  killing livestock during the month-long attack on eastern  Bosnia. It also quotes eyewitnesses of rapes by Serbian  soldiers.    Mazowiecki wrote in his report that there were also cases of  Muslim violation of the Serbs' rights but on a much smaller  scale. He appealed for a more significant presence of U.N.  peace-keeping forces in the Gorazde area which would "reduce the  risk of further Serbian assaults."</p>

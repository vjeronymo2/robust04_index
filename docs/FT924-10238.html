			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / International Company News: Fund management team to quit Hill Samuel HILL SAMUEL Investment Management is losing its 'active quantitative' fund management team to State Street Boston Global Advisers in a move which highlights growing demand in the UK for the computer-based stock selection technique. The team's leader, Mr Alan Greenhorn, who is also a director of HSIM, has developed one of Hill Samuel's most successful asset management products, known as Active Value Management. It has Pounds 450m under management for 11 clients, most of whom are pension funds. Among its clients are Emmanuel College, Cambridge, Cable and Wireless Pension Fund and Allied Lyons Pension Fund. Meanwhile, Hill Samuel has told State Street that it intends to strictly enforce terms of Mr Greenhorn's contract which bars him from working for a competitor for six months after having given a resignation notice. That clause, frequently inserted in fund managers' contracts, is intended to ensure that they do not poach clients for their new employer. Hill Samuel said that while it was disappointed to lose the team, it had already arranged to replace it with other quantitative experts. The company has taken steps to reassure its clients about the new management team. 'We've reassured them that the database and the systems will all remain,' Hill Samuel said. In total, Hill Samuel manages Pounds 9.6bn in the UK. Active quantitative management, a technique pioneered in the US, involves the use of large quantities of data entered on computer software to make stock selections. Mr Greenhorn said that the technique allows fund managers to identify characteristics likely to occur in underperforming stocks and avoid them. State Street, in its US operations, has been a leading provider of active and passive quantitative fund management techniques. Mr Greenhorn will be joined at State Street by five others from Hill Samuel who will join as their management contracts expire.</p>

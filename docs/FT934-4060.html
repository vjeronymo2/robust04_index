			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / Leading Article: Enter Mr Delors It promises to be a lively week for the debate on European industry. On Friday, Mr Jacques Delors' white book on competitiveness will be discussed by the EU's heads of government. Meanwhile, the European Round Table, consisting of 40 heads of Europe's biggest companies, has produced a counterblast against the provisions of the social chapter. In itself, this might seem unremarkable. But according to the British members of the ERT, it represents a significant shift of opinion. Industrial bosses in Germany may have muttered in private for years over the indirect costs of labour. But in public, they have defended the contract between social partners. If they have been converted to the British view of industrial relations, this is a sea-change indeed. It might not do to count on it. The loading of social costs on to industry is partly a cyclical phenomenon. The boom years of the late 1980s, for instance, saw an outburst of environmental legislation. Now that the bill is being presented in the depths of recession, there is a perceptible ebbing of enthusiasm. The same is true of the latest batch of social measures transacted at EU level. But these things may be beside the point. Even supposing industry's appetite for social costs varies with the cycle, the cyclical recovery this time may be slow and hesitant. That might in itself argue for a pragmatic shift in policy. Mr Delors, in a speech prepared for the Confederation of British Industry last month, argued strongly in favour of the social chapter. But the fact that he felt moved to address the CBI - and, indeed, turned up to last Friday's presentation of the ERT's arguments - suggests a possible meeting of minds. That would be very welcome. Some of the ERT's arguments deserve consideration: for instance, that there might be a relaxation of social costs for smaller companies which are creating employment, leaving larger companies to shoulder the burden if necessary. There is also something in the idea of a European competitiveness council, along US lines, which could monitor the Commission's efforts to promote key technologies. Above all, the ERT is surely sensible to argue that the creation of cheap low-tech jobs now is compatible with the creation of expensive high-tech ones later. Mr Delors' task is more complex. He has to reconcile diverging views about deregulation, interest rates, macroeconomic co-ordination, the EU's role in financing big projects and much else. As he prepares for the final year of his presidency, he knows that the EU badly needs intellectual coherence in its economic thinking, after the disasters of the exchange rate mechanism. Mr Delors' white book is awaited with interest.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Colonel General Petro Shulyak, </F> commander of the Ciscarpathian Military District, PVO, by  Lieutenant Colonel Vasyl Tarchynets, chief of the PVO press  service; place and date not given: "Serving the Ukrainian  People"]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Tarchynets] Did it  ever occur to you, when you were a platoon commander, that many  years later you would be the commander of a district? What is  your reaction to the presidential edict granting you command of  the Ciscarpatian Military District?    [Shulyak] I did not even dream about such a post in my years  as a lieutenant. However, frankly speaking, I have been pleased  with all of my service advancements. I think it quite natural,  because every soldier wants to make a career, to become a  general. However, I have never attempted to get a promotion at  any price; I have just worked honestly. Posts and ranks  followed as recognition of my work. Therefore, I see my  nomination for the commander of district troops as such a  recognition as well. The president's edict in this regard is a  legal document affirming my authority in the post of PVO  commander.    [Tarchynets] How do you evaluate the current situation  of the Ukrainian Army -- the combat training of its personnel,  particularly, the preparedness of the conscripts, as well as  technical supplies and morale among the ranks?    [Shulyak] I can say that the combat training of district  units is at a level that guarantees the reliable protection of  western state borders. This, by the way, was affirmed by the  recent regiment exercises which were attended by Ukrainian  President Leonid Kravchuk. However, the training and level of  combat readiness are subject to change; they can be improved  without limits. This refers also to the preparation of  conscripts. Therefore, we, the servicemen, jointly with  military registration and enlistment offices, the Association  for Assisting the Defense of Ukraine, and other institutions,  will take pains to get good specialists in our Army. There is  every possibility to accomplish this.    Understandably, the quality of training of any army  specialist also depends on the prevailing morale, in which he  masters his combat craft. Unfortunately, it is too early to  affirm that every problem has already been resolved here. Let  us say quite openly: We have not yet eliminated violations of  discipline, bullying of conscripts, or just bad manners in the  Army. However, the morale in the Army is going to improve.    [Tarchynets] Why have PVO commanders been changed so  frequently?    [Shulyak] It should be noted that personnel changes are  being made not only in our district, but also in all the other  structures of the Armed Forces. It is conditioned by the  process of building our Army, by bringing its quality and size  in line with Ukraine's military doctrine. There is reduction as  well as creation of new structures in our troops. Personnel  changes follow this process of building. I think that this is  quite a natural phenomenon.    [Tarchynets] What is your opinion about Kostyantyn  Morozov's retirement from the post of defense minister? What do  you think about his book "Flight Under President's Wing"? Was  General Morozov the right man for the post of defense  minister?    [Shulyak] I will begin with the last question. Yes, Colonel  General Kostyantyn Morozov undoubtedly was the right man for his  post at the stage of the creation of Ukraine's Armed Forces. He  did a lot to provide our state with its own Army. With regard  to subsequent activities of the former defense minister and his  book "Flight Under President's Wing," I think that this can be  evaluated only by those who worked with General Morozov and  possess appropriate information.    [Tarchynets] What is General Stepanov's -- the former  PVO commander's -- lot? What is he doing?    [Shulyak] Lieutenant General Stepanov has been appointed  deputy commander of the Odessa Military District for issues of  reform. He still occupies this post.    [Tarchynets] Are you satisfied with your subordinates?  Do you intend to make personnel changes in the district staff,  combined units, formations, and units?    [Shulyak] There are experienced and competent officers and  generals in the district staff; therefore I think that any  urgent personnel changes are inexpedient. The same refers to  the commands of combined units, formations, and units. However,  as is known, the district command recently underwent some  changes. There were new deputy commanders and chiefs of certain  departments and services nominated, while their predecessors  were promoted to higher posts. For instance, Major Generals Oleh  Shustenko and Ivan Kolesnikov became deputy commanders of the  PVO troops, Major General Volodymyr Chernykh headed the PVO rear  units, and Colonel Leonid Polishchuk became chief of the PVO  personnel department. Colonel Vasyl Kazmirchuk was nominated  chief of the troops of radioactive, chemical, and biological  protection.    Following the creation of a new Armed Forces unit -- the  Land  Forces -- which are headed by Colonel General Vasyl Sobkov,  deputy defense minister, a group of PVO officers and generals  will be transferred to work in the Staff of the Land Forces.  Thus, there are more personnel changes to come. [passage  omitted]</p>

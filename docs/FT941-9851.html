			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / City jitters on Clarke's cut in rates 'It's the first mistake Clarke has made,' said Mr Jim O'Neill, currency strategist at Swiss Bank Corporation. The rest of the City seems to feel the same about Tuesday's quarter-point cut in interest rates. Mr O'Neill added: 'We're all entitled to one (mistake), but it undermines the idea that he and Eddie (George, governor of the Bank of England) have got it all worked out.' Mr Derek Scott of Barclays de Zoete Wedd said: 'Eddie George and Ken Clarke do not have the credibility of Alan Greenspan (the chairman of the US Federal Reserve). It all depends now on whether Clarke will take pre-emptive action to stamp out inflation.' But if the City is jittery, Tory backbenchers are more confident about Mr Clarke's stewardship of the economy - whatever they feel about his politics. Mr John Watts, Conservative chairman of the Commons Treasury and civil service committee, said yesterday that the Budget statement had been 'about right' and well presented. Like many at Westminster, he admires Mr Clarke's direct style but he is also concerned about the chancellor's approach - he can occasionally 'charge into a room and drop a scatter-grenade', Mr Watts said. He believes the chancellor was unwise to tell a recent meeting of the committee that the Budget had put an additional 7p on income tax. It played into the hands of the opposition, Mr Watts said.</p>

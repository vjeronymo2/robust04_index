			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> The Southeastern Conference's 10 member schools voted unanimously to authorize  Commissioner Roy Kramer to enter formal discussions with schools interested in  joining the league.  </P> <P> "There is no timetable," Kramer said. "It could be fairly rapidly, and it could  run its course over a period of several months, a year, or more."  </P> <P> If the league does expand, it is expected to add at least two teams because of  scheduling considerations. Divisional play in football also would be a  possibility.  </P></p>

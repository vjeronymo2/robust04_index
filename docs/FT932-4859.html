			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Survey of Uruguay (7): Pensioners have powerful political muscles - The welfare state must break with the past OLD people may not be a majority in Uruguay, but they they have enough political muscle to prevent any threat to their interests. However, unless Uruguay changes the way it cares for the aged, the pensioners will eventually bankrupt the state. The grey panthers are powerful because they are numerous and well organised. Uruguay has a small population of 3.1m people and a stagnant birth rate, with the result that there are now only two working people for every pensioner. About 500,000 people draw a government pension and, unsurprisingly, the state-run pension fund is bust. Mr Carlos Cat, the planning and budget minister, says that last year the treasury had to pump Dollars 200m - about 2 per cent of GDP - into the pension fund. Social security spending, which is mainly pensions, accounts for an astonishing 17 per cent of GDP, Mr Cat says. The deficit was made worse by a 1989 plebiscite; almost 85 per cent of voters agreed with the pensioners' associations that the government should index pensions. Now, as inflation falls, pensioners are getting real rises, because indexation reflects past increases in the cost of living. The fund's deficit has risen inexorably every year since 1989, and Mr Cat now says the deficit could hit Dollars 500m within a few years. However, nobody is saying that state pensions are generous: they are capped at seven times the minimum wage, giving a maximum Dollars 550m monthly pension. But government efforts to modify the pension and social security have suffered the same fate in Congress as its attempts to privatise state companies. Politicians are not only unwilling to confront the powerful grey lobby, but also they reflect a typically Uruguayan conservatism. Mr Cat says the opposition once rejected the government's alarming financial calculations. After hours of debate, he convinced the politicians to accept his data. But they still refused to act. The welfare state was born in Uruguay in 1903 (and not in postwar Britain) when Jose Batlle y Ordonez was elected president and used the country's enormous wealth, earned from beef exports, to provide a range of public social and educational services. Although Uruguay is no longer wealthy and governments have run down the welfare state over the years through underfunding, conservative Uruguayans are still loath to make a break with the past. However, Professor Adela Pellegrino, a specialist in demographics at Montevideo's Universidad de la Republica, disagrees with the doomsters. She says Uruguay's demographic pyramid is not as lopsided as is widely believed. In fact, Uruguay's demographics are better than west European countries, where over one quarter of the population is aged over 65. She points out that 11 per cent of the population in Uruguay is over 65, and one quarter is under 15. This means that people of working age, between 16-64, make up two-thirds of the population. Women make up a larger part of the working population of about 1.2m people than elsewhere in Latin America. The pension issue is therefore something of a red herring. It is undoubtedly in need of radical reform and evasion of social security contributions needs to be stamped out, but Uruguay hardly risks collapsing under the weight of its pensioners. Dr Pellegrino argues that the aged use their political muscle to win a disproportionate share of national income, to the detriment of the poor, or education. As well as unfair, this has serious long term macroeconomic implications: the country is investing too little in improving the quality of its future working population. Over one quarter of Uruguay's population is poor and 40 per cent of children are born in poverty. Furthermore, the poor are the fastest-growing sector of the population. In Montevideo, a poor woman will have an average of 3.6 children; a university-educated woman will have fewer than two. While pensions account for about 17 per cent of gross domestic product, education gets 3 per cent of GDP; a low figure even by regional standards - and half the level in developed countries. Dr Pellegrino suggests that reforms, such as unifying the retirement age, would free money for spending on children, on the poor and on young mothers. Not only would this be fairer, but also it would increase the birth rate and reduce social inequalities. In addition, the more educated and skilled people are, the likelier they are to enter the formal economy and contribute to the pension fund. However, Dr Pellegrino says that emigration - not ageing - is probably Uruguay's most serious demographic problem. In the politically troubled 1970s about 11 per cent of the population emigrated, although emigration has since fallen. There is no precise data on current migration flows, but one third of youths in Montevideo say they would rather live elsewhere. Emigration is bad because it accentuates the proportion of the aged in the population and reduces potential economic growth, because emigrants usually have above average skills. It is also costly, because Uruguay invests in emigrants' education but does not benefit from their labour. The brain drain is particularly damaging for a small country like Uruguay: the emigration of 50 scientists is a significant loss.</p>

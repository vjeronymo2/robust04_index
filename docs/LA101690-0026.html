			<p><P> October 16, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE FOOTBALL REPORT;  </P> <P> WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> USC;  </P> <P> THIS TIME, ROYSTER PAYS PRICE  </P> <P> One week after gaining 203 yards in his debut against Washington State,  tailback Mazio Royster said he felt the effects of his 22 carries for 112 yards  against Stanford.  </P> <P> "They weren't really attacking last week," Royster said of Washington State's  defenders.  </P> <P> "A guy would hit me and I wouldn't feel it too much. But with these (Stanford)  guys, I would feel it every time. They're rough and rugged."  </P> <P> For the record: It was reported last week that Oklahoma, while on NCAA  probation in 1974, was voted to national championships in the Associated Press  and United Press International polls. Actually, USC, with a 10-1-1 record that  included a 55-24 come-from-behind victory over Notre Dame, won the UPI version  of the national title. It was the first season that teams on NCAA probation  were not included in the UPI poll. JERRY CROWE  </P></p>

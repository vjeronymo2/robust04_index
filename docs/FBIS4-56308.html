			<p>BFN     [Editorial report] Panama City Radio Network in Spanish at  1517 GMT on 29 April broadcasts a live relay of a news  conference held by President Guillermo Endara with domestic  reporters in Panama City. The news conference was convened to  announce an increase in long-distance telephone rates in Panama  effective 1 May.    The director of the telephone company (INTEL), in opening  the  news conference, outlines the rate increase.    At 1525 GMT, the microphone is ceded to Endara who,  commenting on several journalists' recent requests for  interviews, says: "I told them that I would not agree to  interviews, particularly in view of the large number of  international journalists interested in seeing me. I told them  I am not the star of this election process and that therefore  they should not regard me as such in their coverage of it. On  election day I will be just another voter.    "I intend to make a public statement. In fact, I am making  one now, which I have been preparing for a long time.    "A very important event will take place on 2 May. For the  first time in the history of Panama's popular elections, the  Executive will vest its authority in the Electoral Tribunal.  This concept was tested, so to speak, during the referendum,  and it worked fine. This is provided for in the law and has been  so ordered by the Executive. This has been approved by the  Assembly and will be enforced. We hope all future governments  will do the same.    "So I will make statements on 2 May. I will talk to you  people on election day wherever I happen to be, and respond to  any questions. The 8 May elections will be very special.    "Some of you might wonder if we are doing this because the  elections will be held in a few days. No, gentlemen. In my  speech at the National Theater, where we pledged to hold pure  and honest elections, I said that although I would not be the  star of the election process, I would continue to work in the  government as usual, that I would suspend nothing, that I would  continue to work as usual until 1 September. I said that the  fact that elections were going to be held did not entail  suspending our work and being idle. I will keep working because  I have pledged to work for the people until 1 September. So  this measure is not the result of a political decision, but the  result of a work done by INTEL for over two years."    At 1529 GMT, Endara goes on to discuss the decision to sell  various government assets in the Colon Free Zone, the need to  develop all assets of the Panamanian people to ensure  development, and his intention to return to private practice as  a lawyer after his presidential term ends.    The 29-minute news conference ends at 1546 GMT, at which  point the relay ends.</p>

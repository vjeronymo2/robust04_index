			<p><P> August 27, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> SCOFFLAW HEAVEN;  </P> <P> PARKING TICKETS GO UNPAID BECAUSE IT COSTS MORE TO ENFORCE THEM  </P> <P> Although nine cities in Ventura County are owed a total of more than $800,000  in unpaid parking tickets, none of the cities have aggressive programs to track  down repeat offenders.  </P> <P> Oxnard has the highest number of tickets outstanding, amounting to $340,554.  That would be more than enough to restore four police positions that were cut  from the city's budget in June.  </P> <P> But officials there and in other cities say many of the unpaid tickets were  issued to out-of-state residents and other hard-to-find people. They say it's  not practical or cost-effective to hunt them down.  </P> <P> "Three-hundred-thousand dollars is a sizable amount," said Oxnard Assistant  City Manager John Tooker. "The question is, how much of that is truly not going  to come back?"  </P> <P> Sgt. George Pultz of the Oxnard Police Department agreed that the city can't  afford to go after parking scofflaws routinely. "We don't have people to search  for a vehicle," he said.  </P> <P> Lt. Don Arth, in charge of the Ventura Police Department's traffic division,  said Ventura's problems with people who park illegally are not serious enough  to warrant hunting them down.  </P> <P> "We just don't have the sheer numbers of people who are doing that," Arth said.  "We might be spending more than we're getting back."  </P> <P> However, he said, the city is planning to increase some parking fines to $25  from the current $7 to $12.  </P> <P> If the increase is approved by the county's Municipal Court Judges Bail  Committee, it may become worthwhile for the city to track down offenders, he  said.  </P> <P> As a rule, cities in Ventura County are not as tough on parking offenders as  Los Angeles.  </P> <P> No local cities use the wheel-locking device known as the Denver Boot, which  Los Angeles applies in cases where five or more tickets are outstanding. Cities  in Ventura County also rarely impound cars, another Los Angeles practice.  </P> <P> Nor do the cities in Ventura County have as serious a problem with parking  offenders as Los Angeles, which, as of April 15, 1990, had close to $249  million in unpaid parking tickets on the books.  </P> <P> The nine Ventura County cities that keep records issued more than 68,000  tickets in 1989. A total of 33,853 tickets, some of them dating from previous  years, have not been paid.  </P> <P> Oxnard and Ojai contract with other agencies, based in Los Angeles and  Torrance, to process parking tickets -- which can include keeping track of  whether tickets are paid, mailing delinquent notices and sending information on  unpaid violations to the Department of Motor Vehicles. Moorpark uses Thousand  Oaks to process its tickets.  </P> <P> Other cities in the county process the tickets themselves. Fillmore tabulates  the information by hand. Santa Paula keeps no records of outstanding citations,  said Brenda Monser, city spokeswoman.  </P> <P> Officials from the Ventura County Sheriff's Department and the California  Highway Patrol said they write very few parking tickets in unincorporated areas  of the county.  </P> <P> Many Ventura County cities allow a parking offender between two weeks and a  month to pay a ticket before mailing a notice and adding a late fee, which is  usually $10 to $20, depending on the city and the type of ticket.  </P> <P> If the vehicle owner still fails to pay the ticket, a notice is sent to the  DMV. The state agency puts a lien against the car. In order to re-register the  car, the offender must pay the ticket.  </P> <P> But those measures aren't always sufficient.  </P> <P> Many of Oxnard's outstanding tickets were issued to cars for which the DMV  lists no registered owner, said Marjorie George, accounting manager of finance.  Some of the cars were owned by people in other states.  </P> <P> In some cases, a violator sells the car without notifying the DMV of the new  owner, she said.  </P> <P> Everette Garmon, revenue manager for Ventura, said people develop cavalier  attitudes toward tickets when they are renting cars, using company cars or  driving cars not registered in California.  </P> <P> Summer is an especially bad time for the county's coastal cities, which are  inundated with parking offenses when out-of-state vacationers arrive.  </P> <P> "If someone's from out of state and they don't want to pay it, there's no way  we're going to collect," said Jim Hanks, finance director in Port Hueneme.  </P> <P> The top offender in the county has 65 outstanding tickets, worth $1,005 to the  city of Ventura, Garmon said. The next-highest violator has 28 unpaid tickets  and owes $476 to Ventura, he said.  </P> <P> Cities occasionally go after particularly brazen offenders.  </P> <P> Oxnard police, who keep a list of habitual parking offenders, made sure to  impound one car that had accrued $800 in unpaid tickets, Pultz said.  </P> <P> Police went to the address where the man was usually ticketed, found the car  and impounded it, he said.  </P> <P> Port Hueneme officials were irritated by a man who continued to park his  motorcycle in a red zone near the Port Hueneme Naval Construction Battalion  Center, Hanks said.  </P> <P> Officers staked out the area after issuing the man's third ticket and warned  him against parking there again.  </P> <P> The fifth ticket brought more than a warning. It marked one of the rare  occasions when the city impounded a vehicle.  </P> <P> "That was a special case," Hanks said. "It became a game."  </P> <P> Usually, Hanks said, the city relies on the DMV to force a person to pay rather  than meting out punishment to scofflaws.  </P> <P> "Normally, we try to keep low-key," Hanks said. "We prefer everyone obey the  law and not have to do these kinds of things."  </P> <P> Other scofflaws have made getting tickets a habit. They collect their tickets  and come in about every three months to pay off the fines, said Garmon of  Ventura.  </P> <P> "We do have people who come in and plunk down $300 to $400 in tickets," he  said. "We're aghast but that's what they do."  </P> <P> </P> <P> OUTSTANDING PARKING TICKETS IN VENTURA CO.  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.55IN:2.66IN:2.55IN:2.55IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="4"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> No. of tickets  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> No. of unpaid  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> City  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> per year*  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> tickets  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Fines owed  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Oxnard  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 18,516  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 11,862  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $340,554  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Thousand Oaks  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 13,267  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 9,418  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $164,268  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Ventura  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 22,000  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 4,992  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $118,087  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Simi Valley  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 4,211  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2,640  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $95,000  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Port Hueneme  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 5,696  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2,520  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $73,000  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Camarillo  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1,475  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1,139  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $22,884  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Ojai  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1,346  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 527  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $8,821  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Moorpark  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1,520  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 557  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $8,432  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Fillmore  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 437  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 198  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $2,476  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Santa Paula  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> not available  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> not available  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> not available  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> * Calendar year 1989 or fiscal year ending June 30, 1990.  </P> <P> Source: city officials.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Producer-director George Lucas of "Star Wars" fame is entering the commercial  wars. His movie-making company, Lucasfilm Ltd., has formed a new advertising  division, Lucasfilm Commercial Productions, to make television commercials and  already has two projects in the works (for Bell Atlantic and Panasonic). Two  other Lucasfilm divisions, Industrial Light &amp; Magic special effects and  Sprocket Systems film editing, have worked on commercials, including spots for  Subaru and Diet Coke. However, the new division marks Lucas' full-scale entry  into commercial production. Lucasfilm Commercial Production will use some  special effects but will rely primarily on live action.

			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Arts: Today's Television BBC2's Young Musician Of The Year competition begins in earnest with the first of the four semi-finals. There are 12 pianists, ages ranging from 14 to 18, competing for five places in the finals, in one of the most heartening and enjoyable events organised by television (7.30). C4's documentary series Cutting Edge offers a study of one of the most interesting schools in Britain: Summerhill, in Suffolk. Started 70 years ago by AS Neill, this is the famous institution which operates on the assumption that children are naturally good, not naturally bad. Every child, however young, can vote in the school's tribunal, and the vote of a five year old carries the same weight as the vote of the headmistress. Lessons are available but children may choose whether or not to attend. Does it work? Anthropologists Peter Getzels and Harriet Gordon try to find out. Andrew Davies' excellent adaptation of Kingsley Amis's The Old Devils reaches its third and last part (9.30 BBC2). Alun, the London Welshman who has returned to his roots, continues his womanising, and the truth emerges about wife Rhiannon's youthful romance with Peter Thomas.</p>

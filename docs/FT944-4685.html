			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Taunton held back by price wars Taunton Cider sales were flat and profits down at the half-way stage, but the group has lifted the dividend as a sign of confidence in the long-term future of the market. 'There is evidence that the worst of the price wars is over,' said Mr Nick Pearch, finance director, yesterday. Shares in the group shed 11p to 143p. Pre-tax profits for the six months to October 29 fell from Pounds 11m to Pounds 10.4m on sales of Pounds 65.2m (Pounds 65.1m). Earnings per share fell from 6.9p to 6.7p, and the interim dividend is lifted from 2.65p to 2.8p. The UK volume market for cider grew by almost 8 per cent in the first half, The group, which ended the half with Pounds 4.5m net cash, said its performance in the take-home sector was ahead of the market. It plans to spend Pounds 7m this year on packaging equipment, while a new plastic bottling line has started operating and a new canning line is expected to come on stream in the second half. Sales of Dry Blackthorn were 10 per cent up and sales of Diamond White, recently launched as a canned drink, grew by 8 per cent. 'Our brands are our key strength. They give us grounds for confidence as more and more consumers join the marketplace,' Mr Pearch said.</p>

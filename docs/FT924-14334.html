			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Market retreats after Major speech THE STOCK market gave a muted response to the keynote speech by Mr John Major, the prime minister, at the Conservative party's conference in Brighton, with share prices sliding back to close only marginally higher on the day, having opened with widespread and sizeable gains. But market commentators were reasonably happy with the performance of the market over a week which saw the FT-SE 100 index drop over 100 points on Monday, when sterling was in free fall against the D-mark, before embarking on a determined recovery. The closing state of the market was in marked contrast to the general view at the outset of trading. Share prices opened on a strong note, reflecting a good showing by Wall Street overnight and another positive performance by sterling against the dollar and the D-mark. Another positive factor in the market was a growing feeling that a series of takeover bids may be about to emerge. Traders and fund managers have been on the alert for possible stake-building exercises and bid moves since the UK withdrew from the Exchange Rate Mechanism. Hongkong Land's dawn raid and tender offer for Trafalgar stock and Hanson's bid for RHM are seen as merely the start of a flurry of corporate activity. 'The devaluation of sterling makes UK companies now look very cheap to European and American predators,' said one dealer. The Footsie opened 11 points higher and topped out in mid-morning when the index posted a 28-point gain. There was little reaction from the markets to the latest inflation figure. Bouts of profit-taking chopped the rise to one of 11 points immediately before the prime minister spoke. By the time Mr Major resumed his seat, the Footsie was a mere 2.8 higher. It closed 2.4 firmer at 2,541.2, down 8.5 on the week but well clear of the 2,446.3 reached last Monday when sterling plunged in the foreign exchange markets. Traders added that London was showing more concern about Wall Street where the Dow Jones average was down 28 points as London closed. Mr Richard Jeffrey, equity market strategist at Charterhouse Tilney, the stockbroker, said: 'Until the market is reassured it will find it hard to make good ground; it needs another interest rate cut.' Turnover of 484.4m shares was disappointingly low, comparing badly with Thursday's 517.6m. Retail, or customer, business in London began to tail off early in the week but quickly revived following two sizeable bought deals and a number of programme trades.</p>

			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Observer: King holds on Good news from the Bank of England. Its chief economist, Mervyn King, has decided to stay on rather than return to academe when his three-year leave of absence from the London School of Economics ends. Not only is King, 45, one of Britain's best regarded economists, but he is also a keen advocate of greater openness in UK policymaking. He wants to see greater independence for the Bank in setting interest rates, mainly because this would make officials more accountable to the public for their various policy mistakes. He's generally thought to have made more of a go of the job than John Flemming, his predecessor, who is now warden of Wadham College, Oxford. There had been rumours that King's enthusiasm for life at the Bank had been tempered by the arrival of ex-Economist editor Rupert Pennant-Rea as deputy governor. However, King's decision to stay on as an executive director suggests that any tensions between the two have been resolved. Having lost Andrew Crockett to the Bank for International Settlements, Threadneedle Street could ill afford to lose another high-flyer in the space of a few months.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Lajos Fur by Zoltan Fekete; </F> place and date not given: "There Will Be Three State  Secretaries in the Defense Ministry"]    [Text] [Fekete] Mr. Fur, the basic principles and laws  worked out by your ministry have always shown a high level of  compromise readiness. Do you think that the changes announced  yesterday and valid as of 1 March will divide the public and  possibly the army as well?    [Fur] I do not think so, because these changes are precisely  the results of the Defense Law based on a broad parliamentary  consensus. Every political force represented in parliament  accepted the need and timing for these changes. Only the  Hungarian Socialist Party would have carried out the changes  after the elections. However, the law required the elimination  of the divided structure, and our history and traditions also  oblige us to create the leading army bodies required by NATO in  its recent concept of Partnership for Peace. One of the major  factors of joining NATO will be the assertion of civilian  control over the Army and the guiding role of the political  echelon in every country. On behalf of the Defense Ministry, I  can assure you that we will continue to inform the political  parties and groups immediately about our every concept and step  and, according to the possibilities, we will also use their  opinions.    [Fekete] What will the top leadership of the Defense  Ministry consist of?    [Fur] According to our plans, and contrary to the current  state administration practice, there will be three state  secretaries in the Defense Ministry: a political state  secretary, an administrative state secretary, and a state  secretary who is an Army commander or chief of staff.    [Fekete] Many people fear that this structure could collapse  if the defense minister is an Army officer.    [Fur] According to the general practice in Europe, the  defense minister is a civilian, and I do not think that it is  worth parting with this practice in the future. Our current  step guarantees the institutional cooperation of the Defense  Ministry and the Hungarian Army in harmony with the Defense Law,  and it also improves their efficiency.    [Fekete] Some 10 days ago, you announced the retirement of  some Army officers in leading positions. You also confirmed  this during the government spokesman's news conference held on  14 January. Does this mainly affect the Hungarian Army  generals, or the staff of the Defense Ministry?    [Fur] The law and regulations stipulating the requirement  for professional Army personnel to retire at the age of 55 are  still valid. This means that these people must retire when they  reach this age, not simultaneously but gradually as they reach  the age of 55. Among the generals in question, two generals  will become 55 in the first half of 1994, and the others will  become 55 in the second half of 1994. I can also say after the  government session that the changes affect various levels, both  higher and lower levels. Mr. Kalman Lorincz, whom I would like  to thank for his activity so far, also declared at the meeting  that he had finished the task he received in 1989 and he would  become 55 on 11 February 1994.</p>

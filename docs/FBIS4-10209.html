			<p>BFN     [Text] Wednesday, 6 April, should mark a step in the  opposition's attempt to implement Article 149 of the  Constitution. Rothschild Francois has a report:    [Begin recording] [Francois] What is certain is that the day  appears extremely decisive for the Coordinating Committee for  National Mobilization, which is seeking installation of a new  power in Haiti. The fate of this resolution bill submitted to  parliament will perhaps be known today. As a matter of fact, the  members of the committee that groups FRAPH [Revolutionary Front  for the Promotion and Progress of Haiti], MDN [Mobilization for  National Development], CARENA [Action Committee for National  Reconciliation] and other political formations are due to be  received by the conference of presidents in the Chamber of  Deputies. For MDN leader Hubert de Ronceray, the meeting  represenets a step forward within the framework of actions taken  by the Coordinating Comittee.    [DeRonceray] We think this is an important step and we hope  that something encouraging for the country comes out of this  meeting.    [Francois] Do you support application of Article 149 of the  Constitution?    [DeRonceray] Yes. Naturally, for us, all the conditions are  fufilled right now, so that Article 149 of the Constitution is  applicable. It is therefore up to our lawmakers to assume their  responsibilities, fulfill their duties, and respond to the  expectations and aspirations of the majority.    [Francois] Article 149 meaning Judge Nerette, or the  president of the Court of Cassation, Attorney Jonassaint?    [DeRonceray] We think that the constitutional principle must  prevail. There are two interpretations of Article 149: an  interpretation favoring the president of the Court of Cassation,  and another favoring the 8 October 1991 government, which would  mean Judge Nerette. For us in MDN, what is important is for  constitutional principle to triumph. Whichever interpretation  prevails, we will accept it because what is important for us is  that the country be endowed with a government capable of  restoring order to this country's life and of finally endowing  Haiti with a stable government capable of promoting development,  progress, and peace.    [Francois] Asked about the attitude of the international  community regarding this anti-Aristide initiative, Hubert de  Ronceray thinks that it is more than time for Haitians to take  responsibility by emerging from this stalemate. He also points  out that the international community is aware of its mistakes in  managing Haiti. That is why, according to DeRonceray, it is  important to move in the right direction.    [DeRonceray] It is certain that during the early days, the  international community will not be enthusiastic. As soon as the  new government shows discipline, competence, and seriousness,  however, there is no doubt that the international community will  be sensitive to such demonstrations and will tend to change  their attitude toward us.

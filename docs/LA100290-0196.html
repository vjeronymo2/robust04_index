			<p><P> October 2, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> PAULEY SEEKING SCOOP AT HOME  </P> <P> NBC newswoman Jane Pauley, who has interviewed hundreds of celebrities, says  she's still waiting to land an elusive scoop: her husband, Garry Trudeau.  </P> <P> "I have thought about asking him," Pauley said, "but A, he would never do it,  and B, I would not ultimately do it.  </P> <P> But I know it's a neat story."  </P> <P> Trudeau, the Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist, celebrates "Doonesbury's" 20th  anniversary this month.  </P> <P> In an interview in the Oct. 8 issue of People magazine, Pauley said Trudeau  believes that "the more high profile you become, the more you have to maintain  it. And you have to adjust your life for updates, just to keep everyone aware,  which is time consuming."  </P> <P> But Pauley said someone should persuade Trudeau to do an interview.  </P> <P> "It's not going to be me, but I'm just going to be really irritated if it turns  up on somebody else's network."  </P></p>

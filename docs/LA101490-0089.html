Should the airport shut down?  </P> <P> The county offered one resident a buyout at $363,000 and was turned down  because the owner said he couldn't buy anything in Orange County for that  amount. C'mon, have you looked? The real problem here is greed! Gosh, ain't  life tough?  </P> <P> BOB HUGHES  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

Dlouhy: Guarantees Are a Matter for the </F> Banks and the Insurance Companies"]    [Text] Prague--Representatives of the major manufacturers  agreed on yesterday's Debata [Debate] television program that  large industrial projects cannot be implemented without state  guarantees. Trade and Industry Minister Vladimir Dlouhy said in  response to this that commercial projects cannot be guaranteed  by the state but, rather, on the basis of guarantee and  insurance companies such as EGAP [Enterprise Guarantee and  Insurance Program] or by the banks.    Skoda Plzen Director General Lubomir Soudek referred to the  small number of Czech banks that are actually recognized  throughout the world as guarantors. Dlouhy described the  absence of bankruptcies as a negative influence on the Czech  Republic's economy. He added, however, that certain structural  changes are taking place in the enterprise sphere. National  Property Fund Chairman T. Jezek said that some firms are indeed  folding, but this happens more often by means of liquidation  than by bankruptcy. Dlouhy also expressed himself in favor of a  smaller percentage of industry in the Czech Republic's overall  economy, a change in the structure of the industry sphere, and  also greater efficiency in industrial output. In 1991,  industrial output declined by 22 percent, compared with 1990. It  declined by 10.6 percent in 1992, compared with 1991, and, last  year, the industrial sector declined by 5 percent.</p>

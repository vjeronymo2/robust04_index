			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on developments related to the Colombian elections  scheduled for 29 May.    Former Justice Minister Enrique Parejo Gonzalez,  presidential  candidate of the National Democratic Alternative (Alternative  Democratica Nacional), has asked President Cesar Gaviria to  appoint an international supervisory board for the elections.  In a letter to the president, Parejo has said candidates Samper  and Pastrana "maintain a monopoly over the media while the other  candidates are discriminated against, in open violation of  constitutional provisions." He has also charged state resources  are being diverted for electoral purposes and in favor of the  two major candidates. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish  27 March 94 p 7A)    During his recent visit to Miami during Holy Week, Andres  Pastrana, New Democratic Force (NFD) presidential candidate,  reiterated his criticism against reestablishing relations with  Cuba. He said: "I do not think it was the right time for  Colombia and Cuba to reestablish relations. I maintain that  position, because when President Castro visited Colombia, all  ?he reporters of Colombia and the world asked him if he  condemned the armed struggle, and a condemnation of the  Colombian guerrillas never came out of his lips." Pastrana also  said Colombia should seek the means to join NAFTA, because it  would increase foreign investments and help the country compete  in international markets. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in  Spanish 2 April 94 p 6A)    Liberal Party (PL) candidate Ernesto Samper has said in  Cartagena that recent expressions of support for him from  Christian, black, and conservative groups show that people are  convinced his campaign "is a serious and organized option." He  has said his proposal?to the country is that of "social  capitalism which considers people," while that of Pastrana is of  "brutal capitalism." (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 28  March 94 p 6A)    In an interview by Bibiana Mercado, Antonio Navarro Wolff,  presidential candidate of the 19 April Movement Democratic  Alliance (AD/M-19), has said he is sure his organization  will,come ?n t?ird place?in the elections. Regarding the  AD/M-19?s d?feat in t?e 13 March legislative elections, Navarro  said i? taught him "obe has to hear?the people's voice which  tells us we are not doing things right. We hav? to correct our  cou?se, and?we are doing so by? Bmong other things, admitting  there is a need for clear positions and for a message of  definite change." He den?ea if there is a runoff between  |??didates Samper and Pastrana, he would call for blank votes,  saying "if I agreed with casting blan  votes, I would not have registered as a presidential  candidate." Asked if he is afraid the AD/M-19 might disappear,  he said: "I am sure the AD will continue to live. I think the  essential thing is to understand that we must go to the local  e?ections with much strength." (Santa Fe de Bogota E? TIEMPO in  Spanis? 27 March 94 p ?A)    Gabriel Borja, spokesman?of the Socialist Renewal Movement,  CRS, has said the group will test its support by promoting a  campaign for blank votes in the presidential elections. He has  said the CRS has ruled out the possibility of supporting any  presidential candidate, including Navarro Wolff. The spokesman  of the CRS, which will give up its weapons and demobilize on 9  April, has said "the campaign for blank votes is a protest  against bipartisanship, corruption, and the government's  disastrous handling of the economy." (Hamburg DPA in Spanish  2015 GMT 2 April 94)    A poll by the firm Centro Nacional de Consultoria taken  between 25 and 27 March in the urban areas of 40 municipalities  showed "if the 29 May elections were held today, Ernesto Samper  would obtain 49 percent of the votes and Andres Pastrana, 41  percent." It also showed that although Navarro Wolff is in third  place, only four percent would vote for him. (Santa Fe de  Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 30 March 94 p 8A)</p>

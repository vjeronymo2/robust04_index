			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Hazlewood hit by losses at four plants: Profits fall by more than 12 per cent - UK chief executive resigns / Shares down 21p Losses at four of Hazlewood Foods' big UK plants have led to the resignation of Mr Chris Ball as chief executive of the group's UK operations. Mr Peter Barr, chairman, yesterday warned that the situation at the four problem plants, in which the group has invested more than Pounds 20m, had continued to deteriorate in the first few months of this year. Hazlewood announced yesterday that profits fell by more than 12 per cent, from Pounds 55m to Pounds 48.1m, in the year to March 31. The shares closed 21p down at 122p. The biggest problem has been the Hilliers plant in Plymouth, which was acquired from Northern Foods in April last year and converted from making frozen foods to chilled foods. It has been running at an annualised loss of around Pounds 4m. 'It has taken a lot longer and proved a lot more costly than we thought,' said Mr John Simons, finance director, yesterday. The group is losing a further Pounds 3m a year at three other sites. It spent Pounds 6.1m at Rowan Foods in Wrexham, which makes ready meals, to double capacity in the expectation of rapid sales growth. The plant, which had been making money, went into the red. A new sausage factory in Sheffield, in which Pounds 3.6m was invested, and a salad processor in Waltham Abbey, where Pounds 1.7m was spent, have also failed to make any returns. Mr Barr said that the expectations for all four projects had not been fulfilled. The non-executive directors had felt that Mr Ball could not get the return the group was looking for. He admitted that the group's problems did not reflect pressure from supermarket price cutting or rising raw material prices. 'I would love to blame someone else - but it's entirely our own fault,' he said. The group was committed to turning Hilliers round, he said, adding that the problems centred on productivity. 'We know what to do and we will be tackling it energetically - but it's a six-month job.' Mr Ball is not being replaced. UK operations will be co-ordinated by a management committee of senior directors chaired by Mr Barr. Overall group turnover grew by 5 per cent from Pounds 761.8m to Pounds 800m. Mr Simons said that the group had achieved 6 per cent growth over the last three or four years. Details Page 27</p>

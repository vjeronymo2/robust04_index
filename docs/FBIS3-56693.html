Kravchuk Gambled on Bagrov and Lost"]    [Text] The elections for president in Crimea are illegal,  and Leonid Kravchuk will in the near future detail his position  on this question. This was announced on the evening of 17  January by Mykola Mikhalchenko, adviser to Ukraine's head of  state. As is known, having come through to the second round of  elections are Crimean Supreme Soviet Chairman Nikolay Bagrov and  Yuriy Meshkov, leader of the pro-Russia Republican Party, who  has a considerable edge on his rival and high chances to win in  the second round. KOMMERSANT-DAILY observer Oleg Medvedev  comments on the new political situation taking shape in Crimea  and around it.    Many politicians in Moscow do not hide their satisfaction at  Mr. Meshkov's success. "An excellent variant!" exclaimed Sergey  Baburin, learning the results of the first round. Presidential  Council member Andranik Migranyan thinks that the residents of  Crimea have made the right choice, and hopes that Ukrainian  leaders would be "wise enough not to make any rash and  provocative moves." Yevgeniy Ambartsumov pledged that the Duma  will not keep aloof from the Crimea question, adding without any  irony that if Meshkov wins, "one may be able to say that now it  is Ukraine's internal affair."    Indeed, if the leader of Crimean Republicans takes the  presidential seat in Simferopol, Moscow, without visibly  interfering in Crimean affairs, would have the possibility of  realizing its geopolitical objectives in Crimea with his hands.  Meshkov's chances of final victory are high: In line with an  understanding reached earlier, four candidates who dropped out  of the race after the first round are supposed to transfer their  electorate to him.    The men in Kiev fear an escalation of tensions in Crimea,  and  expect stepped-up territorial claims on the part of Russia.  Leonid Kravchuk finds himself in a difficult situation. He had  ignored pressing demands by a number of political parties to ban  the elections for Crimean president. Kravchuk had hoped for the  victory of Bagrov, who is loyal to Kiev, but miscalculated. Now  that the success for Russophiles in Crimea is obvious, banning  the elections is rather dangerous. But if Bagrov withdraws his  candidacy, the second round may not take place: It takes two  candidates to hold it.    A new situation is taking shape in Crimea regardless of how  the presidential election story in Crimea ends. Nearly 65  percent of the more than 70 percent of all who went to the polls  voted for candidates who in one or other form support secession  from Ukraine. This voting in fact cancels the results of the  1991 referendum in which a majority of people in Crimea  advocated Crimea's being part of Ukraine. The demonstration of  pro-Russia sentiments by citizens of Crimea considerably  strengthens the hand of Russia in the talks with Ukraine on the  whole range of problems related to Crimea.</p>

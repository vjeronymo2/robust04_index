			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: SANTA MONICA;  </P> <P> PROMENADE TO ALLOW CARS  </P> <P> For the first time in 20 years, cars and trucks will be allowed along the Third  Street Promenade, Santa Monica's downtown outdoor mall.  </P> <P> The mall, which is undergoing extensive renovation, has until now been for  pedestrians only.  </P> <P> The City Council on Tuesday unanimously passed an ordinance that set the speed  limit on the mall at 15 m.p.h. But members left for a future meeting the  decision over the hours in which traffic will be permitted.  </P> <P> Tom Carroll, director of Bayside District Corp., which manages the mall,  recommended that traffic be prohibited from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. But council  members proposed longer time periods during which only pedestrians would be  allowed on the street. Councilwoman Judy Abdo suggested a 6 a.m.-to-6 p.m.  period for foot traffic only.  </P> <P> The council is expected to review staff suggestions in two weeks. If an  ordinance passes then, traffic would be allowed on the Promenade a month later.  </P></p>

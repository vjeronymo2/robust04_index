			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / International Company News: Securities losses take toll on Kemper Kemper, the US financial services group which has agreed to a takeover by life insurance group Conseco, reported third-quarter operating earnings of Dollars 32.7m on its continuing operations, which before one-off factors were flat compared with a year ago. Mr David Mathis, chairman, said the earnings partly reflected the 'unusual conditions' and 'overall distraction' of the third quarter, when the company agreed to a deal with Conseco to fend off a hostile bid from GE Capital. The figures included a Dollars 40m investment loss from the sale of corporate bonds and collateralised mortgage obligations, derivative-type securities which have caused losses at several US financial institutions this year. Results were also hit by a Dollars 3m loss in the company's broking business, reflecting lower commissions. Overall net income was Dollars 17.5m, or 34 cents a share. A year ago, net income of Dollars 162.4m, or Dollars 3.63, reflected a number of one-off factors.</p>

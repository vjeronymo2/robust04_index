			<p><P> November 26, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> YARD SCULPTURE BEATS DROUGHT -- AND GROWS;  </P> <P> CONSERVATION: LOCATED ACROSS FROM VENTURA CITY HALL, THE ECLECTIC ART HAS  ATTRACTED ADMIRERS WHILE ADDING SOME COLOR TO THE DRIED-OUT GREENERY.  </P> <P> Since the city of Ventura enacted a mandatory water conservation ordinance in  March, residents with big lawns have been looking for ways to cut down on  irrigation without seeing their yards turn ugly and dry.  </P> <P> Some people have replaced lush green grass with drought-resistant plants.  Others have opted to cover their yards with gravel.  </P> <P> Musician Walter Stowe, 31, has come up with a more creative -- and inexpensive  -- solution: He has replaced the greenery in his front yard with an  eye-catching sculpture garden.  </P> <P> "With the drought and the water cuts, we weren't being able to keep the yard as  green as we like it, so we decided to make it beautiful in another way," said  Stowe, who makes a living singing with a local rock band.  </P> <P> The sculpture garden, which was started two months ago, is a work in progress.  It features an eclectic collection of scrap materials, most of them put  together by Stowe, his sculptor girlfriend, Elisabeth Montague, and neighbors  from adjoining apartments who share the yard with Stowe.  </P> <P> Every week, it seems, an object is added to the collection -- sometimes by  anonymous donors who drop off their contributions late at night.  </P> <P> "It's a collective effort," Stowe said proudly.  </P> <P> There's a dead tree branch covered with plaster, with plaster leaves hanging  from its sides. There's a papier-mache child standing under a papier-mache  donkey. A worthless television set with a rock on top of it. A chicken wire  "hill" held up by wooden props, and a door frame at the garden's entrance with  a yellow croquet ball on top of it.  </P> <P> Located across the street from Ventura City Hall, the sculpture garden has  attracted its fair share of admirers, Stowe said. "All the time we see cars  stopping and people taking pictures," he said. "It's been a big success."  </P> <P> One admirer is Community Development Director Everett Millais, whose office  overlooks Stowe's yard. While the sculpture pieces are not exactly his idea of  fine art, Millais said the garden is an asset to the community.  </P> <P> "I enjoy it," he said. "It adds interest to downtown. While they're not my  favorite pieces of art, they're whimsical and fun."  </P> <P> Stowe, a self-proclaimed public art fanatic, hopes his garden will bring more  attention to local artists and inspire the city to invest more funds in public  art.  </P> <P> So far, the biggest beneficiary of this window of opportunity for local artists  has been Montague, who is responsible for about two-thirds of the objects in  the yard. "I wasn't showing anywhere," she said, referring to her lack of  success in convincing art galleries to exhibit her work. "This is the perfect  way to show."  </P> <P> For his part, Stowe is no stranger to using art to make public statements. In  June, he used trash collected at San Buenaventura State Beach to put together a  series of odd-looking sculptures along the promenade between the Ventura Pier  and Surfers Point.  </P> <P> The sculptures -- made from empty cigarette packs, beer and cat food cans, soda  bottles, broken glass and twisted metal -- did not last long before city  workers razed them.  </P> <P> But by then, Stowe said, he had accomplished his objective. "The city got the  point," he said. "If you go to that part of the beach now, it's squeaky clean."  </P> <P> The sculpture garden, Stowe said, isn't trying to make a statement, but he  hopes that it will promote creative recycling of scrap materials and water  conservation in the city.  </P> <P> "I guess it's anything you want it to be," he said. "The yard was getting ugly,  and we decided to give it some color."  </P></p>

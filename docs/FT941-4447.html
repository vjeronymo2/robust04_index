			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Mexican bank chief is named Mr Miguel Mancera is to be governor of Mexico's newly independent central bank. Head of the existing non-independent central bank for the past 11 years, he had been favourite to take the post. The Bank of Mexico, which becomes formally independent from April, will have broad powers to set monetary policy, and will be prohibited from providing credit rates to the government below market levels. However, the finance ministry will have overall responsibility for exchange rate policy. Mr Mancera, an economist with a doctorate from Yale, will serve for three years and nine months. He is widely respected in Mexico and abroad, and is known for his aversion to inflation, commitment to pro-market economic policy, and support of a stable currency. However, some Mexican banks have criticised him for his cautious attitude to financial liberalisation, in particular his opposition to rapid development of a futures and options market in Mexico. Four other economists appointed to the board of governors are all known for their technical expertise and political independence. They are: Mr Guillermo Prieto, Mr Ariel Buira, Mr Jesus Yacamen, and Mr Francisco Gil Diaz.</p>

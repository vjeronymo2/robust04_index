			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Paper backs defence minister BORBA, Yugoslavia's pro-government daily newspaper yesterday threw its weight behind General Vejko Kadijevic, the defence minister who last week said that a civil war had started in the country, writes Laura Silber. Described by Borba as 'a soldier for a time of crisis', he is a member of Mr Ante Markovic's federal government. But until recently he supported the Communist Party - Movement for Yugoslavia, a revived party formed by retired army officers and hardline Communists. However, he has exercised a moderating influence on the army's leadership following the outbreak of ethnic violence between Serbs and Croats two weeks ago.</p>

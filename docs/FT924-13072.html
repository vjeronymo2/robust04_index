			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei loses ground in low volume AN overnight fall on Wall Street and diminished hopes of a co-ordinated interest rate cuts by Germany, US and Japan, depressed investors, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. Share prices lost ground on late index-linked selling and the Nikkei average fell 258.68 to 17,369.81, but was 1.8 per cent higher on the week. The index rose to the day's high of 17,617.15 on buying by public funds, but saw a low of 17,300.50 in late trading on a fall in the futures market. Volume rose to 220m shares from 192m. Losers led gainers by 601 to 316 with 181 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 13.38 to 1,313.27 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose just 0.03 to 1,055.53. Mr Peter Tasker, strategist at Kleinwort Benson, said that the recent low volume reflected the view that share prices are too high for aggressive buying, with the outlook on the economy still weak. On the other hand, with public funds waiting to buy at the lower end, investors are wary of selling heavily. High-technology issues were depressed on weak IBM earnings overnight. NEC plunged Y19 to Y706 and Hitachi lost Y14 to Y748. Pioneer Electronic fell Y180 to Y2,870 on rumours of sharply lower interim earnings than originally expected. China-related stocks were active ahead of the Emperor Akihito's visit to China on October 23. Yaohan Japan, the retail chain, rose Y70 to Y1,450 and Bandai, the toy maker, gained Y40 to Y2,650. Profit-taking pushed down pharmaceutical and chemical issues, which have been popular on the Aids and Interferon themes. Inabata fell Y20 to Y1,140 and Green Cross declined to Y30 to Y1,530. Leading large capital issues which were previously bought on speculation of buying by public funds, fell on profit taking. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries lost Y11 to Y563 and Kawasaki Steel fell Y1 to Y295. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 78.83 to 19,071.33 in volume of 10.5m shares. Roundup THERE was only one serious winner in the region yesterday. HONG KONG attacked the 6,000 level again, but pulled back on profit-taking to close with the Hang Seng index 71.69 higher at 5,985.33, 6.9 per cent higher on the week. Aggressive rotational buying by overseas institutions swept up property and utility laggards including Cheung Kong and Hongkong Telecom, which rose by 3.3 per cent and 3.5 per cent respectively. AUSTRALIA continued its week-long fall, the All Ordinaries index closing 19.3 lower at 1,419.8, its lowest close since March 1991, and 3.2 per cent lower on the week. Turnover was at the highest level of the week, with ADollars 270m worth of shares traded. NEW ZEALAND ended marginally lower the NZSE-40 index ending 3.92 down at 1,373.95 in turnover of Dollars 18m. Lion Nathan, a star performer over most of this year, ended 11 cents down at NZDollars 4.20. Its exposure to the Australian economy, an increasingly bitter legal wrangle over its purchase of National Brewing from ACIL and rumours of an earnings downgrade by one New Zealand broker were blamed. TAIWAN finished lower but financials were up on moderate buying in three state-run commercial banks. The weighted index closed 21.84 lower at 3,707.18, but up 2.3 per cent on the week, in turnover of TDollars 18.8bn after TDollars 23.4bn. BOMBAY's brokers went back to a trading boycott after more than 200 tax officials raided the offices of over 20 brokers, because of their suspected involvement in Bombay's stocks and securities scandal. They said that they had stopped trading because they were not sure whether deals would be honoured. On Thursday, the BSE had registered its fourth consecutive decline, closing 19.18 lower at 3,086.45.</p>

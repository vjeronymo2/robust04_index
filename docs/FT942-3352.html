			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Arts: When comedians were craftsmen - Television Declare that there was a golden age of television in the late 1960s and early '70s and those who run television today - especially the accountants - accuse you of wearing rose tinted spectacles. The reality was nothing like your fond memories, they say, nothing is ever as good as nostalgia suggests and if only you could judge those old programmes against today's you would realise they were actually pretty primitive and limited. Well, the BBC has recently enabled us to make such a comparison, in comedy at any rate, and the evidence suggests that the accountants are wrong. Morecambe And Wise and Steptoe And Son really were superior. Having decided to mount a series to mark the 10th anniversary of Eric Morecambe's death, BBC1 called it Morecambe And Wise: Bring Me Sunshine which was absolutely right. To watch was to remember how your face would go into a broad grin the moment you heard the signature tune and stay that way right through to 'Bring Me Sunshine' at the end. Moreover, that title emphasised the fact that these men were - in the case of Ernie Wise, still are - not just comedians, but entertainers who certainly wanted to make you laugh, yet, beyond that, to bring sunshine into your life. The difference between them and today's comedy entertainers was, surely, their background. Today's comedians grew up watching Monty Python on television, but Morecambe and Wise grew up - not that many years earlier - in the music halls and variety theatres. True, they did stand-up routines; their television show always began that way, but music played a bigger part. Can you imagine Hale and Pace doing a wicked yet fond send-up of 'Singing In The Rain'? Or Enfield and Whitehouse with their legs stuck in buckets doing 'New York, New York'? It is not that today's performers would necessarily be incapable of mastering the routines; what would be missing is that affection which was central to everything that Morecambe and Wise did. Watch them with their guest Eric Porter when he says 'Ah, so you'd like a bit of Shakespeare?' and turns upstage to prepare a suitable extract. Eric and Ernie vamp till ready, then Porter turns back and, in heaviest Shakespearian accents, intones 'If they could see me now/That little gang of mine/I'm eating fancy chow and drinking fancy wine . . .' and with dawning delight you realise that the three of them are going into a song and dance number. Before long they have a straw hat and silver topped cane apiece and are into the sort of soft-shoe routine that every entertainer of that generation seems to have learned as a juvenile. Morecambe and Wise were not Astaire and Kelly, but they could do you a cramp roll or a ball change without thinking about it. Perhaps Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson could too, but I doubt it. The number of 'jokes' in a Morecambe and Wise show was often small (and in the repeats now being transmitted by BBC1 on Saturdays even smaller, because the original 45 and 50 minute shows have been cut to 30). Much of the humour came from 'business'. In this week's programme Eric went into a shop to buy a pair of binoculars and Ernie promised him his most powerful pair. Go to the other side of the shop and look at this pin, Ernie instructed, holding up nothing. The minute Eric's back was turned Ernie whipped out a three-foot pin from under the counter . . . That, essentially, was the gag but, in the tradition of pantomime, they milked it expertly until the audience was falling about. In all those sketches where the two stars perpetually pretended to upstage their eminent guests, they actually did precisely the opposite and made them look good. Today's stand-up comedians exemplify the phrase: they stand up, and they tell jokes, but they do not spread a sense of fun, contentment and affection to 20 million viewers. As for the people who now make situation comedies, the example set by Galton and Simpson in Steptoe And Son seems to have been forgotten. With series such as BBC1's Once Upon A Time In The North, and ITV's two new Sunday series, Mother's Ruin and The House of Windsor, we have slipped back into the rut worn in the 1950s. The picture quality of The Lost Steptoes has been poor, unsurprisingly, perhaps, since they were non-professional copies, abandoned for years in somebody's cellar (the BBC having destroyed the originals, of course). However, the high quality of the writing is still unmistakable. In the episode shown last week Harold, the son, has difficulty breaking it to his father, Albert, that Hercules, the horse that has always pulled their rag and bone cart, has died in the shafts and been unceremoniously removed - 'For cat's meat]' the old man snarls in fury. Albert has always been the horse lover while Harold knows himself to be suspected of mistreating the animal. The point is that here, as in so many Steptoe scripts, the division between comedy and tragedy is about as substantial as morning mist. Mother's Ruin is also about an adult son living with a parent, this time Leslie Flitcroft with his mother. He (Roy Barraclough, late of Coronation Street) is bald, unmarried, and panting for sex behind the counter of the shop where he sells herbal nostrums. She (Dora Bryan) is an ageing theatrical luvvie who lurks upstairs pouring gin from a teapot, losing money on the horses, and making her son's life a misery. The set up may be no less authentic than that in Steptoe And Son but the difference is stark. The laughs in Steptoe are induced as often by pathos or the wry recognition of some eternal truth about the human condition as by 'funny' lines. In Mother's Ruin we are expected to laugh when Leslie says 'He had a verruca' and his mother says 'I thought it was a Volkswagen'. We are supposed to laugh when a man with a hangover says to Leslie 'Get out of here - both of you'. We are invited to laugh at a schoolboy suicide attempt in which the pills turn out to have been laxatives. We are even meant to laugh at the line 'I turned down spotted dick to come here'. All change is not progress.</p>

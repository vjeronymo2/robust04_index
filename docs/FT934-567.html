			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Papua New Guinea mine targeted The Papua New Guinea government claimed last night that its security forces were poised to recapture the large and controversial Panguna copper mine on the island of Bougainville before the end of the year, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney. However, Radio Free Bougainville was playing down the progress of government defence forces, claiming that no PNG troops were moving towards the mining township, although admitting that they were in the area. The mine, originally operated by CRA, was once a main source of income for the PNG government. It became the subject of a bitter and bloody clash between local landowners, together with Bougainvillean secessionists, and the PNG government in the late-1980s, and was closed down in 1989. Any retaking of the mine is thought to be a largely symbolic gesture, as PNG forces may have considerable difficulty defending the isolated township against guerrilla attacks.</p>

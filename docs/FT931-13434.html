			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Rubicon boosted by lower interest costs A substantial cut in interest charges enabled Rubicon Group to raise pre-tax profits by 26.5 per cent in the half year ended November 30 1992. Turnover of the group, which makes storage and handling systems for retailers, moved up 13 per cent to Pounds 10.4m (Pounds 9.2m), but operating profit showed only a 3 per cent increase including exceptional credits of Pounds 99,000 (Pounds 77,000). However, after interest costs of Pounds 45,000 (Pounds 262,000) the pre-tax profit came to Pounds 1.22m (Pounds 963,000). Earnings per share were 8.2p on nearly 10m shares after reconstruction (55.4p on 1.43m shares), and there is a return to dividends with an interim of 1.5p.</p>

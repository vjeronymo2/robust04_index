			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, April 28 (AFP) -- Air France made a net  consolidated loss after minority interests of 8.476 billion  francs (1.5 billion dollars) last year, the state-controlled  airline said on Thursday [28 April] at the end of a board  meeting.    In 1992 the company had reported a loss of 3.266 billion  francs.    The results for 1993 included a provision of 1.8 billion  francs to restructure the company.    The board delayed a decision on the sale of its majority  holding in the Meridien hotel group, the company said. It had  decided to "accept the view of the privatisation commission to  choose between the two bids which had been retained."    These bids are from the British Forte group and from the  French Accor company.    Air France is believed to have debts of 37 billion francs,  analysts here noted, and is struggling to survive its massive  losses.    Restructuring of the company is linked to liberalisation of  the French air transport industry which was taken a step  forwards on Wednesday when the commission of the European Union  found in favour of a complaint by the French TAT airline against  the French government.    TAT, of which British Airways (BA) owns 49.9 percent,  obtained an instruction from the Commission to the French  Government that it must open Orly airport south of Paris to  flights to Toulouse and to London.    BA said that this effectively opened Orly to other airlines.    The French Government wants to inject 20 billion francs into  Air France and has said that half of this sum could be provided  this year if the EU Commission approved it under competition law.    The Commission, in approving a takeover by Air France of the  French airline Air Inter in 1990, had laid down as a condition  that France should open its markets gradually to more  competition from within the European Union.    The French Transport Ministry said late on Wednesday that it  would appeal to the European Court of Justice against the  decision about Orly.    The decision would entail "serious consequences, by opening  the whole French internal network to competition without a  transitional period," it said.</p>

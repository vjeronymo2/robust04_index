			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Live dispatch" by 'Abd-al-Ghani Nasir al-Shamiri, radio </F> and television correspondent in Mukayris]    [Text] Dear listeners: God's peace and blessings be upon  you. I greet you from the valiant Mukayris district in the Abyan  Governorate. Here is the true account of the progress of the  purging of the strongholds of treason and separation. As for  the 20th Brigade in Mukayris, the secessionist, rebellious  traitors imagined that through this brigade and the  extraordinary amounts of ammunition stored in it, they would be  able to declare separation from this brigade. However, they  were disappointed, for their evil plotting boomeranged against  them. Our faithful, unionist forces managed on Thursday [5 May]  at 1100 to seize the brigade, keeping its ammunition to defend  the Yemen of unity of democracy, the Yemen of wellbeing and  peace. As for the personnel of this brigade, some of them  surrendered, while the others were captured.    The vanguards of the faithful, unionist forces are marching  to pounce on the remnants of the [word indistinct] traitors and  rebels, hammering the last nails in the coffin of separatists  who rebelled against constitutional legitimacy and harbored evil  and ill intentions against this beloved homeland. However, the  unbelievers plotted and planned, and God too planned, and the  best of planners is God. [koranic verse]    The vanguards of our valiant unionist and legitimate forces  are removing the remaining dens of traitors, pounding their  heads, which harbor secessionist illusions, and making them  taste the bitter consequences of their evil intentions and acts.  In al-Dayqah area this morning, the al-Wahadah Brigade forces  under the command of Staff Colonel 'Abdallah Mansur engaged the  rebellious secessionist forces of the 30th Brigade. Their  forward forces were destroyed by our valiant, unionist forces,  the defenders of unity, democracy, and constitutional  legitimacy. Many personnel were detained and the entire  equipment of those two brigades [as heard] were seized.    Our forces are now continuing to liquidate other units that  continue to persist in their course of injustice, misguidance,  rebellion, and separation.</p>

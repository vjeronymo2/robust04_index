			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Property: A chance to make hay by the Spey - Cadogan's Place An unusual property totalling about 25,000 acres is for sale beside the river Spey in Morayshire, Scotland. Most of it comprises the Rothes estate and its near-20,000 acres, for which the price is Pounds 11.25m. The rest is the Carron estate, for which Pounds 850,000 is sought. Buy both for Pounds 12.1m (through Bidwells in Perth: tel. 0738-30 666). For the money, you get an attractive package (if not sold in separate lots) of forestry, farming and fishing over a vast tract halfway between Aberdeen and Inverness. It lacks only a laird's mansion, although a six-bedroom farmhouse is available. But the local council probably would be sympathetic if the new owner wanted to build a grand house to match his outlay on a bonny piece of Scotland. The forests are a mixture of trees of different ages and species, from mature Scots pines ready for felling to young sitka spruce. All have been tended carefully and thinned. Whether whole trees for telephone poles or building timber, offcuts for fencing or thinnings for chipboard, they are close to major timber plants in Inverness and Stirling. And there are good roads through the forests. The vendor is Eagle Star Insurance and Ian Grant, the company's forestry manager, says: 'When people tell you what a marvellous infrastructure a forest has, there's only one question to ask. Have they actually used the roads to extract wood? Can they take the heavy trucks?' Immediate income from cutting the mature trees awaits the buyer; UK and Scandinavian prices have risen 17 to 20 per cent lately. It is all free of income tax. Working forests and farms also receive 100 per cent relief from inheritance tax and the value of the growing crop - the principal item - is excluded from any assessment for capital gains tax. There is plenty of space for re-planting with money from the various woodland grants and management grants offered by the government. The forests also offer deer-stalking and some shooting, while rarer species of wild life include capercaillie and ospreys. The ospreys like to search for salmon and sea trout along a long stretch of the river Spey, which is the other major asset in the sale. The season lasts from February 11 to September 30. After poor years in 1990-92, 1993 was good for salmon, with 603 caught. Thus, with fishing on either bank for five rods, Eagle Star is looking for offers of around Pounds 4 to Pounds 4.5m for the fishing beat if sold separately. Otherwise, it is part of the Pounds 11.25m asking price for Rothes. ***** The Lower Dess estate near Aboyne, Deeside, is an alternative. Its annual average is 136 salmon, but it does offer a sizeable house as well as a 300-acre let farm and 73 acres of woods. Strutt &amp; Parker in Edinburgh (031-226 2500) is seeking offers over Pounds 1.35m. This is the first estate with salmon fishing to be available on Deeside since it was last sold in 1975.</p>

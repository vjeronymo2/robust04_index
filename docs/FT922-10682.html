			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Sharp rise in building orders CONSTRUCTION orders rose sharply during the three months to the end of February, according to figures published yesterday by the Environment Department, Andrew Taylor writes. But construction industry leaders were swift to deny that this indicated that a recovery might have begun. The department said public and private orders placed with contractors rose by 2 per cent compared with the previous quarter and by 12 per cent compared with the corresponding period 12 months earlier. The Building Employers' Confederation, representing 7,000 companies with a combined annual turnover of more than Pounds 30bn, said: 'The increase in new orders is due almost entirely to an exceptional rise in public non-residential orders in February - which could be due to just one very large contract. 'We see no sign of recovery at this stage and are forecasting a further sharp fall in construction output this year.' Travis Perkins, Page 25</p>

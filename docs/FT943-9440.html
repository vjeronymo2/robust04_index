			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Customer confidentiality paramount in status inquiry system Sir, You reported ('Credit check plan on hold', August 8) that banks and some of their customers are experiencing practical difficulties following the introduction of a new procedure for status inquiries. The new system was devised following the Co-operative Bank's refusal to answer inquiries without the express consent of its customers. I hope that, despite any teething problems being experienced with the new system, everyone will accept that customer confidentiality must remain paramount, and that we can now all be confident that no one can gain information about our accounts without our permission. Terry Thomas, managing director, The Co-operative Bank, 1 Balloon Street, Manchester M60 4EP</p>

			<p><P> May 14, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERSPECTIVE ON 'THE VISION THING';  </P> <P> IT MIGHT BE A STRATEGY, BUT HE'S BEING LAPPED  </P> <P> George Bush knows that the United States' 45-year occupation rule of Europe is  now over and that Americans are being pushed toward the periphery of European  affairs by forces we can no longer control and sometimes can hardly influence.  We can only understand them, and the President has given no proof that he does.  </P> <P> Bush does have a strategy, I think. He believes a U.S. military role in Europe  is essential to keeping the peace and a U.S. economic role is essential to  American prosperity. So he is trying to retreat as slowly as possible.  </P> <P> But we are being outflanked by events every day.  </P> <P> Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III seem to think this is a  long-distance race, and they keep looking back to see where the other runners  were and are, not realizing that they have been lapped already. Europe is on  the Concorde.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> ACTION ON HERMOSA VIDEO SALES DELAYED  </P> <P> The Hermosa Beach City Council, acting on a recommendation from its former  interim city attorney, has delayed action on a proposed ordinance that would  restrict video sales and rentals to the commercial strip along Pacific Coast  Highway.  </P> <P> Stanley Remelmeyer, who relinquished the interim post after undergoing heart  surgery, suggested the delay to allow time for his successor, Charles S. Vose,  to review the proposed ordinance. No date was set for receiving Vose's opinion.  </P> <P> Former City Atty. James Lough had advised the council that the measure, which  would ban video sales and rentals from neighborhood commercial (C-1) and  restricted commercial (C-2) zones, might be unconstitutional.  </P> <P> The issue arose early this year when some residents complained that Hermosa  Video, a new store on Hermosa Avenue in the downtown area, was renting adult  movies. Scott Gallagher, the store's owner, said that he had a legal right to  offer his customers a selection of adult-rated movies to compete with other  outlets. Adult movies make up only about 8% of his stock, he said, and as a  result it does not fall under zoning restrictions that bar adult-oriented  businesses.  </P> <P> "We're taking it a day at a time until we hear what the new city attorney has  to say," Gallagher said Wednesday.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Nikolay Litkovets: "Environment and the Navy: </F> Zolotoy Rog, Bay of Concern"]    [Text] A feud between the Vladivostok city government and  the Pacific Fleet over the fuel base on the shore of Zolotoy Rog  Bay has now gone on for more than 15 years. The city "doesn't  like" its harmful effect on the environment. But without the  only fuel base capable of fueling all classes of ships, the  fleet will be half-paralyzed.    The storage tanks and production equipment of the Pacific  Fleet's fuel storage facilities and bases recently marked their  50th anniversary. Given their total lack of bilge and ballast  water treatment stations, their effect on the environment is  limited only by the service personnel's enthusiasm. Meanwhile,  taking each tonne of oil-contaminated water to the civilian  sailors' treatment facilities costs the fleet roughly 10,000  rubles. This situation stems from the fact that financing for  the construction of treatment facilities in  Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy has been frozen at the level of two  constructed tanks and the foundation for a boiler. And the  Primorskiy Kray Environmental Protection Committee has banned  the construction of a station in the vicinity of Vladivostok  altogether. The committee's specialists maintain that the  treatment facilities will be an additional source of pollution!  But while demanding that the navy not pollute the environment,  those same specialists have not impeded the operation of a  seaport bilge and ballast water treatment station located next  to the ill-fated Pacific Fleet fuel base or the construction of  additional treatment units at a civilian fuel storage facility  in the commercial seaport. Nor are Pacific Fleet ships capable  of "making their way through" to those stations: The fishermen  and civilian sailors already have more than enough ships of  their own, and foreign ship owners pay hard currency to have  their wastes treated. And yet the Navy is accused of being the  sea's most active polluter.    Yes, some of the criticism of the Navy is justified. Its  ships, with the exception of a few recently built ones, lack  effective systems to treat bilge. Equipped only with tanks for  fecal and waste water, they are forced to discharge it into the  sea since the Fleet lacks treatment facilities of its own. But  fewer than 15 percent of the ships and vessels based here belong  to the Navy, and an even smaller percentage in terms of tonnage.  If one takes into account the fact that, in addition to the  sailors, 23 sewage pipes and all the city's industrial  enterprises dump their waste water into the Zolotoy Rog bay  without any treatment whatsoever, it becomes clear that the  fleet is by no means the main "wrecker" of the environment.    But when our future and the future of our children are at  stake, determining who has caused the most harm to that future  is not the main concern. A glance at a map showing the extent to  which areas of the sea around Vladivostok are contaminated with  heavy metals is truly shocking: The maximum allowable  concentrations have been exceeded many times over, in some  instances by several orders of magnitude. And so we need to  discuss not just how to stop the practice of discharging  untreated wastes, but also how to clean up wastes that are  already "rotting." Can this be done?    The Pacific Fleet, for example, has just 15 oil-spill  cleanup  ships, four of which are in Vladivostok, but only two are  operable. And only one of them -- the MUS-342 -- is designed to  skim petroleum product films from water surfaces. The others  operate roughly like this: A man in an oil-stained padded jacket  uses a pitchfork to scoop the waste from the water and toss it  onto the deck. So the battle against environmental pollution at  the current stage is for the most part haphazard.    "We proposed the establishment of a municipal office to  clean  waste and bilge from the water surface back in 1989," said  Captain First Rank Aleksandr Nazarenko, chief of the Pacific  Fleet environmental protection inspectorate. "After all, there  are city services that collect household garbage, and something  similar is needed on the water. But it turns out that nobody  wants to take responsibility for the water, so there still isn't  anyone in charge of protecting it from pollution caused by human  economic activity."    Late last year a decision was adopted to assign a number of  bays around Vladivostok to the city. And so now is the time to  think about setting up a municipal enterprise to clean up those  waters. And under these circumstances, in Aleksandr Nazarenko's  opinion, the Fleet should move as quickly as possible to carry  out an environmental field documentation of coastal military  installations, use it as the basis for devising an environmental  monitoring program, and make that program part of an integrated  and centralized environmental protection system that would  operate in conjunction with civilian agencies. A Pacific Fleet  ecological inspection service should be initiated by pooling at  least the available waste-cleanup ships and equipment under a  single command (they are currently assigned to the auxiliary  fleet), completing the construction of the bilge water treatment  stations, and cooperating with the kray environmental protection  committee. These environmental protection measures will hardly  result in an immediate return that can be measured in rubles or  other currency. Another kind of return is more important -- an  averted ecological disaster that has been planted like a mine  under our future.</p>

			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Stepping out on to a wider stage: Why traditionally secretive Swiss companies are opening up to new investors The Swiss are not normally associated with radical change. But something of a revolution is taking place these days in Switzerland's big financial and industrial companies. Traditionally withdrawn and secretive about their affairs, they are now actively courting foreign and small investors and publishing a great deal of information about their activities. The changes will allow Swiss companies to raise funds more cheaply and sharpen their competitiveness against international rivals. But the changes do not mean that it is now open season for would-be foreign corporate raiders on undervalued Swiss companies. The authorities still provide their companies with defence mechanisms, such as allowing them to limit the number of shares a single person can vote. But this practice too is beginning to be challenged and the process of liberalisation is unlikely to be reversed. The opening up of Swiss companies is illustrated by the case of Nestle, the largest Swiss industrial company. Since 1988, it has eliminated a ban on foreigners being registered as owners of shares, and has begun publishing interim financial statements and information about its budgets and strategies. This year, along with several other Swiss companies, Nestle is expected to reduce the nominal value of its shares to make them more appealing to small investors. A single Nestle share now costs about SFr9,000 (Pounds 3,500). This does not present a problem to big institutional investors, but is a substantial deterrent to individuals. Two related reasons can be cited for the changes in the stolid Swiss corporate culture. First, many Swiss companies have become so large that they can no longer rely solely on local capital markets for their financial needs. Yet when they go into international capital markets to raise funds, they come under pressure to improve disclosure standards to international levels and to eliminate discrimination against foreign investors. At the same time, the opening to foreigners of the Swiss capital markets in the late 1980s has put new pressures on local fund managers to perform better, because of competition from international rivals. Consequently, they are taking a more discerning view about their investments in Swiss companies. In some cases, notably that of the giant Basle-based pharmaceutical groups, Ciba-Geigy, Roche and Sandoz, there is also a fear that Switzerland, with its strong environmental movement, may no longer be a congenial place to conduct business. In the past couple of years, these companies have been stepping up their investments outside Switzerland, and appealing to the international capital markets to help finance these moves. Indeed, it was Roche that started the trend of actively attracting investment in 1988. It split its shares - which had previously traded at about SFr250,000 apiece - by 50 for one, and simplified its Byzantine share structure. Since then, Roche has steadily improved the quality of its financial reporting and split the shares again last year. The pay-off for the group from these moves has been quick to come. Roche shares have become much easier to buy and sell, now that there are many more in circulation. This in itself makes them more attractive to more investors. They have become the most actively traded Swiss shares, with daily turnover of SFr40m-SFr60m. Improved liquidity has helped boost the ratio of the share price to the size and profitability of Roche's business. The price/earnings ratio of Roche bearer shares today is about 28, almost the same as that on shares of Glaxo of the UK or Merck of the US. By contrast, shares of Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz languish on p/e ratios in the low teens. Roche says the higher rating has made it easier to generate funds in international capital markets at competitive rates. Last April, it raised Dollars 1bn through an innovative warrant bond issue with an interest rate of only 3.5 per cent. Then it received a further SFr1.03bn through a share rights and warrants issue in October. That, in turn, has made it easier for the group to keep pace with overseas rivals in making large takeovers. In 1990, it paid Dollars 2.1bn for 60 per cent of Genentech, the US genetic engineering company and last year it bought Nicholas Laboratories, the European over-the-counter drugs business owned by Chicago-based Sara Lee Corp, for Dollars 821m. All of this has not been lost on other big Swiss companies. Most now publish consolidated financial statements, follow recognised European or international accounting standards, and delegate an executive to deal full time with investors' needs. The big three Swiss banks - Union Bank of Switzerland, Swiss Bank Corporation and Credit Suisse - have even revealed details of their hidden reserves. 'We have to come up to the expectations of well-informed international investors,' says Mr Hans Geiger, a member of the executive board of Credit Suisse, the country's third largest bank. There has also been rapid progress on the issue of removing discrimination against foreign investors. The most common policy among Swiss companies is to have two classes of shares, registered and bearer, the former being restricted to Swiss nationals and the latter being mainly for foreigners who want to conceal their identity. While both types of shares have voting rights, the registered shares usually have a much lower nominal - or face - value and thus much greater voting power. Several companies have followed Nestle's lead in opening their share registers to foreigners. These include Ciba-Geigy, Sandoz and Brown-Boveri, the engineering group. This has left many Swiss companies vulnerable to takeover bids, at least in principle, partly because their share prices are still relatively low by international standards and partly because Switzerland has no effective takeover code. Many companies have insulated themselves from takeover threats by taking advantage of a Swiss law which enables them to limit the proportion of a company's shares that a single investor may own. But even this protection is no longer secure. Last May, an alliance of foreign and Swiss pension funds forced the board of Holzstoff Holding, a paper making group, to withdraw a motion that would have limited the voting rights of any individual shareholder. The opening up of Swiss banks to foreign investors is complicated by a law saying that in order to qualify as Swiss, a bank must be able to show that a majority of its shares are held by Swiss nationals. Thus, the big banks are unlikely to liberalise their capital structures completely for the foreseeable future. Swiss companies also face constraints in splitting their shares. While companies that have shares with a nominal value of more than SFr100 have been able to split their shares, most companies have shares with a par value of SFr100, the minimum allowed by law. As of July 1, however, a revision in the companies act will enable all companies to lower the par value of their shares to SFr10. In spite of the difficulties, most analysts are convinced that there will be no turning back to the secretive and parochial old ways. 'In two or three years, Swiss companies will be in the first division among European companies in terms of transparency,' predicts Mr Thierry Lacraz of Geneva bankers Pictet &amp; Co. That does not mean that Swiss executives are all enthusiastic about the changes they are making. Many are tormented by the question of whether or not such moves will contribute to a gradual undermining of the basic culture that has driven the large Swiss industrial companies and banks up to now. But they also know that to compete successfully in world markets it is no longer enough to be Swiss.</p>

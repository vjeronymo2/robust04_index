			<p>BFN     [Text] The regime of President Mobutu Sese Seko of the  Republic of Zaire is still bent on destabilizing Angola. That  is why it is permitting its territory to be used as an emporium  for the supply of weapons and other logistical means to Jonas  Savimbi's organization. Our correspondent Joao Caluque reports  from Moxico Province:    Commander Jose Joao Rafael says that Jonas Savimbi's  organization is receiving logistical supplies from trains  travelling from Bilondo in Zaire to Luau District of Moxico  Province, which has a border with that country. The commander  of the government forces in Moxico says that another consignment  of military equipment is being carried by aircraft coming from  Zaire. Within Angola light aircraft transport the equipment out  of Luau, Cazombo, and Lumbala N'guimbo Districts in Moxico  Province. Speaking about the immediate intentions of the  National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] in  the province, Brigadier Jose Joao Rafael also said that Jonas  Savimbi's organization has brought into Moxico more than two  battalions with the aim of attacking and dislodging government  forces from positions in the city of Luena.</p>

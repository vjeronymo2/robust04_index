			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / International Company News: Mannesmann bravado is now thin on the ground SOME of the pioneering bravado has waned in the 2 1/2 years since Mannesmann won its licence to operate Germany's first cellular telephone system  - a move which marked its first significant departure from its traditional engineering business, writes Christopher Parkes. The initial total investment of Dollars 800m has drained group resources at a time when profits have been squeezed by international recession and a slow-down in home markets. However, the network is up and running. Mannesmann, which owns 51 per cent of Mobilfunk, along with partners Pacific Telesis of the US (26 per cent), DG Bank (10 per cent), Cable &amp; Wireless (5 per cent), Lyonnaise des Eaux (2.5 per cent) expect great things. But not quite yet. Consumer confidence in Germany is low and falling. National retail sales fell 6 per cent in July, just as D2 Privat, as it is known, and D1, the federal telecommunications utility's competitor, made their debut. So far it has about 10,000 subscribers, and has given itself nine years to hit 2m. It aims to break even in 1994. But while the partners have been spending, the Bonn telecommunications ministry has grown increasingly enchanted by the notion of competition and mobile phones for all. Mr Christian Schwarz-Schilling, the minister responsible, called in June for bids for a licence for an E1 network. It is potentially more flexible and cheaper than D1 and D2 and it is likely to present a formidable challenge that was unforeseen when Mannesmann took the plunge.</p>

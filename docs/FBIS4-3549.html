			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, April 21 (XINHUA) -- Russian President Boris  Yeltsin told local leaders here today that the political  situation in the country is stabilizing, according to the  ITAR-TASS NEWS AGENCY.    Opening a meeting with the heads of local republics and  regions in Moscow, the Russian president also stressed that the  balance between the executive and legislative branches of power  is taking shape.    "Much has changed in the country in the past few months,  political stabilization is gaining strength, the disastrous  state of dual-power has been overcome," Yeltsin pointed out.    "The system of meetings with the republic heads is being  renewed," the president said, adding that approximately five to  seven such meetings should be held a year.    Today's meeting is the first of its kind since the adoption  of a new constitution and the elections for the federal  parliament.    On the recent local elections in the country, Yeltsin said:  "The elections are valid in 61 federal regions. In only 17 is  voter turnout too low." He expressed the hope that all the  local elections would be concluded by the end of this year.</p>

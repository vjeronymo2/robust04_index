			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PELICAN SCARE;  </P> <P> HUNDREDS OF DEAD, DYING BIRDS RAISE ALARM IN EASTERN SIERRA  </P> <P> Several hundred white pelicans have been found dead or dying beside eastern  Sierra lakes and streams that supply drinking water to Los Angeles, leaving  state and federal wildlife officials mystified and concerned.  </P> <P> The unusual die-off of the large migratory birds is no threat to the water  supply, they stressed. But tests are being conducted to see if something in the  water could be causing the deaths.  </P> <P> Although the white pelicans -- cousins of the brown pelicans found on the  California coast -- nest over a wide area of the West, the trouble seems  confined to the eastern Sierra.  </P> <P> "We don't know the cause of the mortality," said Vern Bleich, wildlife  biologist with the California Department of Fish and Game.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Most Found at Crowley  </P> <P> Most of the pelicans have been found during the last three weeks at Crowley  Lake, a reservoir and popular fishing lake run by the Los Angeles Department of  Water and Power north of Bishop. Carcasses and stricken birds also have been  found farther south along the Owens River and at Tinemaha and Haiwee  reservoirs, part of the city's vast Owens Valley waterworks.  </P> <P> Preliminary tests have found an unusually high number of parasitic worms in the  walls of the stomachs of nearly all the birds, said David Jessup, a state  veterinarian and pathologist in Sacramento. There were signs of malnutrition  that could be explained by the worms, but the birds did not appear to have  starved, he said.  </P> <P> Jessup said, however, that many other causes cannot yet be ruled out. No  significant pesticide residue has been found, but more detailed tests will be  made to see if the pelicans had ingested high levels of toxic metals, he said.  </P> <P> Certain metals and chemicals have been held responsible for large-scale bird  deaths elsewhere in California. Selenium-tainted water that ran off  agricultural fields is blamed for killing waterfowl at the Kesterson Wildlife  Refuge in the San Joaquin Valley. Jessup said that selenium tests had not yet  been completed on the pelicans.  </P> <P> State officials are sufficiently alarmed to have requested this week that more  carcasses be sent to Sacramento for study in a Fish and Game Department  laboratory.  </P> <P> High levels of iron and zinc were found in the first Owens Valley pelicans  tested, but those metals are not ordinarily considered toxic, Jessup said. "We  don't know quite what to make of it," he said Wednesday.  </P> <P> White pelicans do not usually breed beside Crowley and the Owens Valley  waterways, preferring instead lakes and wetlands farther north.  </P> <P> A large breeding population is found at the Klamath Basin wildlife refuge near  the California-Oregon border, and a smaller group nests on Anaho Island in  Nevada's Pyramid Lake northeast of Reno.  </P> <P> The Pyramid Lake colony suffered a very low nesting rate last spring, perhaps  because of a third winter of low snowmelt into the Truckee River. But the  Klamath Basin pelicans, the only breeding colony in California, seem to be  thriving.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Problem at Refuge  </P> <P> "We haven't seen anything out of the ordinary up here at all," said Jim  Hainline, wildlife biologist at the Klamath Basin refuge.  </P> <P> No identifying bands have been found that would allow the carcasses to be  traced, state biologists said. Most white pelicans migrate to Mexico in the  fall. The birds found at Crowley Lake and in the Owens Valley may have been on  their annual migration, biologists said.  </P> <P> Crowley's water level is exceptionally low this fall, in part because of a  dearth of rain and snowfall and in part because of a court order requiring that  water normally diverted into the lake be released instead into Mono Lake.  </P> <P> As the water level at Crowley falls, concern has grown among anglers and some  officials that pelicans are eating too many trout trying to spawn upstream in  the lake. The pelicans have been blamed by some people in the area for  depleting the trout. However, biologists said there are no indications that the  pelicans were deliberately poisoned.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. SUPREME COURT UPHOLDS FLAG BURNING AS PROTEST  </P> <P> Not too long ago Larry Flynt (publisher of Hustler magazine) wore our beloved  flag as a diaper. I was enraged and The Times published my letter stating my  feelings.  </P> <P> Now that the Supreme Court has ruled it is permissible to desecrate our  national symbol, I feel I owe Mr. Flynt a public apology.  </P> <P> Sorry 'bout that, Larry.  </P> <P> MARY E. HAYES  </P> <P> Lakewood  </P></p>

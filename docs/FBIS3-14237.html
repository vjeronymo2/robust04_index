He referred to the Israeli arms  shipment to the rebels which was recently discovered, which  confirms the imperialist double-dealing played by America to  delegate one of its allies to play its role. Lt. Gen. al-Bashir  told the media and press leaderships at his weekly press  briefing session this afternoon, that the rebel movement had  lost its credibility as a so-called national movement, as it had  become a tool for foreign powers. He put foreign interference  as the major obstacle to peace in Sudan. He affirmed that Sudan  is still committed to the Intergovernmental Authority on Drought  and Development [IGADD] initiative.    He also praised the accord among the Somali factions [as  heard], expressing Sudan's continued appeals to solve the  problem by Somalis, condemning foreign intervention, which had  escalated the conflict.    Although the Sudanese National Salvation Revolution elements  are clean and honest, yet the attorney general had directed  immediate action to be taken on any corruption complaint. Lt.  Gen. al-Bashir warned the rumormongers of the negative impacts  of their foul deeds.</p>

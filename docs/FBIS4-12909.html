			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin by Karmit Gay, </F> Sheli Yehimovich, and Shlomo Razon 13 April; place not given --  recorded]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Yehimovich] The Jewish  settlers were once favored by the government, even when your  party was in power before. Now they have been somehow pushed  into a corner. Naturally, they are not all made of one skin.  They are not all Barukh Goldstein. Many of them have a  different world view. Do you intend at any stage to resume a  dialogue with them, hold a closer and more frequent dialogue  with them?    [Rabin] In a democratic state, it is legitimate to support  or oppose the government policies. Staging legal demonstrations  is legitimate. It is not legitimate to make threats, warn use  of force. Certainly it is not legitimate to issue halakic  decrees urging soldiers to disobey orders. To me, this is most  grave. It is inconceivable to call on soldiers of the IDF  [Israel Defense Forces] -- which, as the military, is subject to  the democratically and legally elected government which issues  legitimate orders -- to disobey an order. Had we accepted the  principle that anyone may decide for himself what is right and  what is not -- whether he is a rabbi or a public figure --  hundreds and thousands of soldiers would have refused to serve  in Lebanon, and hundreds, if not thousands, would have refused  to serve in the territories.    I believe the Jewish nation has a right to settle in Eretz  Yisra'el, but according to a concept. When I was prime minister  between 1974 and 1977, I prevented the establishment of a Jewish  quarter in Hebron. I believed it was a mistake. This is what  Qiryat Arba' is for. I opposed setting up Jewish settlement in  areas densely populated by Palestinians. I agreed to the  establishment of settlements in the 'Etzyon Bloc, in Qiryat  Arba', in the Jordan Rift Valley, and on the outskirts of  Netanya, such as Alfe Menashe, and Elqana. I never wanted  settlement in the heart of the Palestinian population in Judaea  and Samaria, between Ramallah and Nabulus.    Jewish history mentions Nabulus but, for example, Ashqelon,  Qiryat Gat, and Ashdod are situated on historic Philistine land.  Today they are rightfully part of the State of Israel. I do not  suggest that we view the Bible as the book of maps of the Jewish  state. To me, the Bible is the book of religion, real values,  real codes, tradition, and history of the Jewish nation. This  is how I studied it. Not as the book of the precise maps of the  Jewish state. [passage omitted]</p>

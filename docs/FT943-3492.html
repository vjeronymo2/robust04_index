			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Charities' portfolio range set to widen The Charity Commissioners are considering widening the investment powers of charities to allow the use of derivatives in managing charitable portfolios. Derivatives are financial instruments, the value of which is based on an underlying investment such as shares and bonds. Mr Sanjay Sen, assistant commissioner, said the use of derivatives was one aspect of a review on investment powers which was being undertaken by the commissioners. They are likely to make their recommendations later this year. The review reflects the commissioners' policy of seeking to broaden the investment powers of charities. Last month restrictions on investing elsewhere in Europe were lifted. At present the use of derivatives is confined to common investment funds, which are pooled investment vehicles designed for charities. They work in the same way as unit trusts but dividends can be reinvested gross. The investable assets of charities, excluding property and cash, are estimated at Pounds 25bn, but only about Pounds 4bn to Pounds 5bn is invested in common investment funds. The commissioners have consulted fund managers on the use of derivatives.</p>

			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / China grooms future leaders: Tony Walker perceives possible new succession arrangements WHEN Mr Qiao Shi, the chairman of the standing committee of China's parliament, bade goodbye to fellow leaders before his present tour of south-east Asia, the television cameras lingered perceptibly on an especially warm exchange with Mr Zhu Rongji, the senior vice-premier charged with restoring order to China's booming economy. It was an intriguing moment at a time of considerable uncertainty about China's leadership succession, and suggested that the shadowy Mr Qiao and the enigmatic Mr Zhu are not only political allies, but close to each other personally. At a time of increasing speculation about the worsening health of supreme leader, Mr Deng Xiaoping, and with Premier Li Peng's continued absence from view with a heart condition, the greater prominence being accorded Mr Qiao and Mr Zhu is pointing to possible new succession arrangements. Western officials in Beijing note that, for the past few months, talk of a collective leadership with Mr Jiang Zemin, the party boss and state president, at its core has been quietly shelved. They attribute this both to Premier Li's bad health and also to a perceived lack of enthusiasm in any case for a team involving Mr Jiang and Mr Li, neither of whom is held in particularly high esteem by the party rank and file. The emergence of the 69-year-old Mr Qiao, a long-serving member of the standing committee of the ruling Politburo, coincided with his appointment in March as NPC chairman. He has used this post skilfully to achieve greater public prominence, and to champion his pet cause of law reform. Chinese and foreign observers are now openly canvassing the growing importance of a 'Shanghai faction' in the leadership centred around Mr Zhu and Mr Jiang, both of whom are former mayors of China's largest city; and Mr Qiao who was an underground party organiser in Shanghai in the period before the 1949 revolution. Among various leadership scenarios one sees Mr Qiao replace Mr Jiang as general secretary of the Communist party, Mr Jiang continue as president - effectively the 'front-man' - and Mr Zhu assume the premiership: that is if Premier Li Peng's health does not improve. Mr Zhu's continued rise through the ranks would also depend on success in his efforts to control the economy. He could hardly expect to rise further if the economy fails to respond to present attempts to rein it in, and chaos ensues. Mr Qiao, who has spent much of a secretive career engaged in internal party work and in overseeing the country's security apparatus, is referred to by some Chinese as a 'budaoweng' - one of those bottom-heavy dolls that is impossible to tip over. This is a reference to the fact that he appears to have prospered near the top of the Communist party through many upheavals. An apparatchik, Mr Qiao is believed to have a strong power base both in the party itself and in the security services, strengths that both Mr Zhu and Mr Jiang lack. Mr Qiao, on the other hand, has been virtually invisible to the wider Chinese public for much of his career, although he has been close to the top for at least the past decade. His three-week tour of Association of South East Asian Nations, which is being extensively covered in the Chinese media, may well be an attempt to enhance his public image. Foreign travel has traditionally been used by the Chinese authorities to burnish the credentials of a potential leader. Mr Qiao is regarded as a reformist and a supporter of Mr Deng's policies of economic opening. In spite of his involvement with security he emerged from the 1989 Tiananmen episode with his reputation relatively unscathed since it was reported that he had opposed the use of force to put down the student demonstrators. It was also suggested at the time that he had been offered, and turned down, the top party post. Mr Qiao may now be ready to come in from the cold.</p>

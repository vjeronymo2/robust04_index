			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Madrid, 13 Jan (AFP) -- The newspaper EL MUNDO  reported today that Cuban leader Fidel Castro has categorically  rejected Spain's political-economic reform proposal, arguing  that it seeks to impose pluralism and democracy on Cuba.  According to EL MUNDO and as can be deduced from the report  presented in the summer of 1993 to Castro by Carlos Solchaga,  former Spanish economy minister, the Spanish Government advised  Castro to implement a rapid transition to capitalism. According  to the newspaper, Castro was also especially upset because  Solchaga does not make the slightest mention of the U.S.  blockade, blaming the Cuban system alone for the serious crisis  affecting the island.    Carlos Solchaga's secret report recommends that Castro  implement immediate reform in three areas: privatization of all  commercial sectors and industries; reduction of state  intervention to a minimum by introducing a market economy with a  Western-style fiscal system; and allowing the free economic  initiative of Cuban and foreign individuals and companies.    EL MUNDO goes on to say that Solchaga contradicts one of the  Castro's main theories, according to which Cuba can overcome the  crisis through the development of two profitable and  well-organized economic activities -- tourism and sugar sales.  EL MUNDO notes, citing Solchaga's report, that "the stagnation  of the remaining productive sectors would prevent the chosen  sectors from developing."    In its study of the Cuban ecomony, the Solchaga report says  that the Castro government has been unable to generate wealth  because of political factors. In his research, Solchaga refers  to the situation of the Cuban economy as disastrous, emphasizing  that "galloping inflation" and "huge budget deficits" have  paralyzed the country.    According to EL MUNDO, Fidel Castro is aware that the  economic changes proposed by the Spanish Government and the IMF  would lead to a transition to democracy and pluralism. EL MUNDO  notes that time and again Castro has explained that he will  never give up the Communist Party's monopoly on power. Instead,  he insists that "Cuba must learn from China and Vietnam."  According to Castro, Cuba's future lies in "a democratic  dictatorship like the ones in China and Vietnam, which have not  abandoned the Marxist-Leninist doctrine."    The document submitted by Spain has broken the usual  unanimity within the Cuban system. According to EL MUNDO,  Carlos Lage -- in charge of the Communist Party's financial  affairs and third in command -- considers that the Spanish  recommendation for transition is a valid option</p>

			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / World Trade News: EC condemns US 'bullying' over contracts - Long-running row about public procurement comes to a head THE European Community's senior trade official, Sir Leon Brittan, yesterday condemned as 'unilateral bullying' Washington's threat to freeze out EC companies when awarding US federal contracts. His comments followed a statement earlier in the day from Mr Micky Kantor, US trade representative, that the federal government would stop buying goods and services from some or all European Community nations if the EC did not end discrimination against US goods in public procurement contracts by March 22. 'This is the second aggressive trade measure in the first two weeks of the new (Clinton) administration,' the European Commission said, referring to dumping duties of up to 109 per cent provisionally levied last week on US steel imports from seven EC states and 12 other countries. Sir Leon said: 'I cannot believe it is in anybody's interest, European or American, to attempt to deal with trade issues in this way. We do not accept this form of unilateral bullying.' He urged the US to show restraint, and said he would be discussing the crisis with Mr Kantor in Washington during his first formal meeting with his US counterpart on February 11. The US action follows an almost year-long effort to reverse an EC 'utilities directive', which came into force on January 1 and gives EC companies preference in bidding for public utility contracts in sectors such as telecommunications, power generation and transport. The sanctions will only hit products not covered by the procurement code of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, such as telecommunications, airports, waterways and services. However, if the US withdraws from the Gatt procurement code, it will be free to broaden the retaliation to include an estimated Dollars 500m worth of EC contracts covered by the agreement. It will also send a signal that American commitment to the Gatt is second to its determination to ensure what it sees as fair play for its companies. Mr Kantor called the action 'a measured first step'. He said that despite many attempts at negotiation during the past year, 'the EC has simply refused to show a sufficient desire to conclude a balanced agreement'. The US complains that the EC directive discriminates against purchases with more than 50 per cent foreign content by requiring Community utilities to apply a 3 per cent price preference to 'European' bids and giving utilities the option of rejecting non-European bids. Sir Leon claimed Washington had not accepted an EC proposal which would have frozen the dispute until a global solution was found. The US had yet to respond to a broader EC document aimed at solving all outstanding issues, he added. He pointed out that Washington had protectionist policies of its own. He listed the Buy American Act, the procurement policies of state governments in the US and access to US utilities markets. A US trade official said that in exchange for a liberalisation of the EC Utilities Directive, the US had offered to bring a number of American states into the Gatt government procurement code, and to deal with any 'legitimate market access problems' EC companies might have with private utility bidding.</p>

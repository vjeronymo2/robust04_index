			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Berkeley profit on share deal BERKELEY Group, the house-builder, made a profit of about Pounds 35,000 in just a few hours yesterday after it was revealed that the group had bought and sold 300,000 shares in rival construction group Higgs &amp; Hill. Berkeley in a few weeks either side of Christmas quietly acquired a 0.7 per cent stake in Higgs &amp; Hill at prices thought to be between 37p and 38p. The group yesterday disposed of this stake at more than 50p after details of its purchases were disclosed by Higgs &amp; Hill directors. Mr Tony Pidgley, Berkeley's managing director, said that it had sold the shares, acquired as a trade investment, to avoid its intentions being misinterpreted. Three years ago Higgs &amp; Hill was subjected to a bitterly contested and unsuccessful Pounds 167m takeover bid from YJ Lovell. Mr John Theakston, Higgs &amp; Hill chief executive, said: 'We felt we had to make an announcement yesterday to protect our shareholders from selling their shares too cheaply to what could have been another potential bidder working in the same sector. 'We first became aware of the purchases at the beginning of last week and Berkeley was still buying shares as late as last Friday. This was followed by a 5p rise in our share price to 43p on Monday. As a result we were under pressure from the Stock Exchange to make a statement.' Higgs &amp; Hill's shares have fallen from more than 100p a year ago and from more than 400p three years ago. Last night the shares closed at 49p, which Mr Theakston said compared with a book net asset value of Pounds 2 a share at the end of December. Berkeley has performed well during the recession. In the six months to October 31 it raised pre-tax profits by 27 per cent to Pounds 6.92m and increased its interim dividend by 10 per cent. Higgs &amp; Hill however, saw first half profits decline from Pounds 1.06m to Pounds 673,000 and cut its dividend from 6p to 1p. Mr Pidgley said that the company became interested in Higgs &amp; Hill after it sought to place some contracts with the company and realised it was undervalued. Berkeley's share price rose yesterday from 314p to 318p. See Lex</p>

			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Utilities gain ground on higher yen SHARE prices moved up marginally in quiet trading ahead of the weekend as most investors remained inactive after another day of volatility on the currency market, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225-issue average gained 27.89 to 17,010.03 on last minute, arbitrage-related buying, leaving it 0.9 per cent higher on the week. After moving within a narrow range in the morning, the index fell to the day's low of 16,887.53 in the afternoon before rising to a high of 17,023.58 just before the close. Volume fell to 220m shares against 250m. Losers led gainers by 477 to 420 with 228 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks gained 0.94 to 1,294.06 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 0.18 to 1,035.99. The Nikkei index has fluctuated within a 343 point range during the week and many traders expect the market to remain around 17,000 with buying by public funds preventing a heavy fall. Mr Alan Livsey at Kleinwort Benson said that the bear market seemed to have ended but that little would happen for the next month or so. Electric utilities, which depend on debt to fund capital investment, gained ground on the higher yen and lower bond yields. Tokyo Electric Power advanced Y10 to Y2,570 and Tohoku Electric Power added Y50 to Y2,540. Steel issues were higher on buying by institutional investors, trying to take advantage of the stocks' dividend potential ahead of the March book-closing. Nippon Steel put on Y3 to Y298 and NKK appreciated Y3 to Y259. Sony lost Y100 to Y4,000 after the company announced a 62 per cent fall in consolidated pre-tax profits for the three months ending in December. Some investors fear that the current strength of the yen will depress Sony's profits further. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 34.27 to 18,385.54 in volume of 62.6m shares. Selling was centred around high-technology issues, while pharmaceuticals were also weak on profit taking. Roundup A GOOD week for the region, particularly for Hong Kong, ended relatively quietly. Bombay was closed for a Hindu holiday and will reopen on Monday. HONG KONG ended a nine-day rally, but political optimism lingered on as profit-taking pushing the Hang Seng index down by a token 16.85 to 6,170.09, 5.3 per cent higher on the week and 7.4 per cent better on the past ten trading days. Turnover rose from HKDollars 3.73bn to HKDollars 3.90bn. There were still buyers in some senior blue chips with the most active stock, HSBC, gaining HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 64; but the second in line, Jardine Matheson fell HKDollars 1.25 to HKDollars 49.25. AUSTRALIA reflected a spate of selling orders in afternoon trade, the All Ordinaries index closing 12.6 down at 1,594.7, 0.5 per cent down on the week in turnover of ADollars 263.5m. BHP fell 14 cents to ADollars 14.10 in spite of a favourable January production report, but John Fairfax closed three cents higher at ADollars 1.89 after announcing interim net profits. NEW ZEALAND took its third successive tumble, the NYSE-40 losing 18.4 at 1,572.53 after a heavy gain on Tuesday when Telecom announced heavy reductions in its workforce. TAIWAN's weighted index ended 48.83 at 3,912.67 on profit-taking, still 3.6 per cent up on the week. MANILA remained positive with blue chips providing support to the market. The composite index gained 14.98 to 1,473.24, a rise of 4.8 per cent on the week. Turnover was strong at 737m pesos from 610m pesos. SINGAPORE closed off the day's highs as investors took profits and the Straits Times industrial index rose 6.91 to 1,639.04, up 1.6 per cent on the week.</p>

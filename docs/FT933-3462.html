			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Management (The Growing Business): VAT moves 'a timid step forward' - In A Nutshell The government needs to be far more radical in its proposals for abolishing the small firms audit if it is to stimulate enterprise, according to a report by the Small Business Bureau, a Tory party organisation which lobbies for the sector's interests. The bureau describes the government's present proposal, to exempt companies with an annual turnover below the VAT registration threshold of Pounds 37,600 as 'a timid step forward'. The Department of Trade and Industry's thinking appears 'woolly and lacking in commercial reality,' it adds. It calls for the audit to be removed as a mandatory requirement for all companies defined as 'small' by the Companies Act. This would extend exemption to companies meeting at least two of the following requirements: sales under Pounds 2.8m, a gross balance sheet of less than Pounds 1.4m and fewer than 50 employees. *SBB Policy Paper No. 1.

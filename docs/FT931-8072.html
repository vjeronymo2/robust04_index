			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Records: Rock back to the '70s THE STYLE gurus tell us the 1970s are back in fashion. But what version of the 1970s? As the albums below demonstrate, there were more 1970s than we tend to remember. Consider Blockbuster] The Sensational 70s (Castle CTVCD 209). This double CD celebrates a (mostly) platform heeled glitter splattered British pop version of the decade from the likes of The Sweet (Blockbuster), Mud (Tiger Feet), David Essex (Gonna Make You A Star) and T Rex (Hot Love). If the very titles makes you salivate and you wish you hadn't thrown away those loon pants, then this is the 1970s for you - but not, whatever the style gurus say, for your children. Or consider Bill Clinton's 1970s, neatly represented by Fleetwood Mac. The group not only provided the President with his campaign song, Don't Stop, Thinking About Tomorrow, but reformed for his inauguration. Witchy, decidedly bitchy and yet somehow bland, The Chain (Warner Bros 9362-45188-2) is a four-CD boxed set that neatly captures the group's American heyday with a mix of bluesy ballads romantic farragoes. Interestingly, the set oscillates between being a collectors item and a coffee table package. It has a big booklet, but rather than matrix numbers and biography, this one consists of lots of photos and handwritten scrawls. Taken together the pair of albums bookend the decade. For a cleaner sounding, even more romantic and yet bluesier Fleetwood Mac, try Albatross (Columbia CD 31569), a budget-priced version of the group's final days in Britain, which includes most of the classic tracks of the period. At the time, Bonnie Raitt's 1975 outing Home Plate (Warner Bros 7599-27292-2) seemed less impassioned than her earlier, commercially unsuccessful, albums. Listening to it with her recent Capitol mega hits in mind it seems a natural progression and a good example of her ability to find virtue in unlikely songs (What Do You Want The Boy To Do?). Equally revelatory is Ace's Mel &amp; Tim collection, Starting All Over Again (CDSXE 078). They only had a pair of hits, but they represent a wonderful laid back version of Southern Soul. More forward looking is Sequel's imaginative The Old School Rap collection (NXT CD 217), a double CD of Sugar Hill tracks that lays bare the genesis of rap from Grandmaster Flash and Melle Mel onwards. Far More problematic is Pete Townshend's Who Came First (Ryko RCD 10246). A hymn to Townshend's guru, Meher Baba, it remains essentially a private album. Far more unsettling and powerful is Television's 1977 debut album, Marquee Moon (Elektra 75559-60616) in which youthful passion and angst are combined in equal measure. The title track, which signals an end to the essentially private concerns of the decade almost as forcefully as the Sex Pistols, remains as powerful as ever. But the album of the moment must be James Booker: Bunco Partner (Hannibal 1359). This was actually recorded in 1976, but it comes from another time. Booker offers a surreal melange of classical (Chopin), folk (Ledbetter) and popular song (On the Sunny Side Of The Street) held together by a firm New Orleans backbeat. The result is simple, unadulterated pleasure: the sound of one man caressing the keyboard in private.</p>

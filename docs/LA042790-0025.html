			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART CENSORSHIP IN CINCINNATI  </P> <P> In response to your editorial "Censorship in Cincinnati" (April 10), please  spare me your superior attitude. Since when is pedophilia or sadomasochism  something to be celebrated? Or tolerated? There seems to be a general campaign  by civil libertarians to silence those who oppose this point of view by  referring to them as unsophisticated yahoos.  </P> <P> It is an effort to desensitize people which I pray to God fails. I am not sure  how this type of display can be prevented without endangering the very real  cultural benefits of the National Endowment for the Arts. We might start by  reminding those in charge that "what we tolerate, we learn to accept, and  eventually embrace." It is a thought I can hardly bear.  </P> <P> MRS. HAZEL R. ELLIOTT  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

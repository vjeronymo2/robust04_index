			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / People: Church elected to NEC Judith Church, national health and safety officer for MSF, the technical and professional union, has been elected to Labour's National Executive Committee. She is the first woman to hold one of the 12 seats reserved for trade union representatives, rather than one of the five seats reserved for women. After graduating from Leeds University in maths and phil-osophy, she did voluntary work in Africa for two years. Returning to the UK, she spent brief spells in both the chemical and food processing industry before, in 1981, taking up a post as a factory inspector with the Health and Safety Executive. During one such inspection, in a concrete manufacturing plant, she recalls making her mark permanently by stepping confidently into a trough of unset concrete. In 1986, she left the HSE and went to work for ASTMS, the white-collar union which subsequently merged with TASS, the technical union, to form the 600,000 strong MSF. She stood as the Labour candidate for Stevenage in the April general election, but failed to win the seat.</p>

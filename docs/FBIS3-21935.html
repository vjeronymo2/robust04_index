The three Colombian "firms" are headed by Colombians known  as  "Pablo" or "Pablito," "Caballo," and "Duro."    The Peruvian organization is headed by the Cachique Rivera  brothers.    The shipment of 3,653 kg of washed cocaine paste, wrapped in  75 bags, was seized in the aforementioned location.    The drug had been stockpiled in underground "caches" in the  jungle near the 1,800-meter landing strip of "El Diamante,"  ready to be loaded into small planes bound for Colombia.    The route currently used by the Colombian "narcopilots"  includes Colombia, Brazil, and Peru. Brazilian air space and  the city of Cruzeiro, near Ucayali, are used by Colombian mafia  organizations to ship the drugs to Colombia.    The "traffickers" take this route to elude the Yurimaguas  radar and the possibility of being pursued by the Peruvian Air  Force T-27 planes that patrol Peruvian air space in Upper  Huallaga.    Intelligence sources have shown that traffickers have moved  to areas like Apurimac Department and the jungle edges in  Ayacucho, Pasco, Cusco, and Madre de Dios Departments because of  the interdiction activities by the Peruvian forces of order.    Traffickers take the drug which is stockpiled in the  production areas in Upper Huallaga, Aguaytia, Ucayali, Pozuzo,  Pichis Palcazu, Oxapampa (Pasco Department) and Palmapampa  (Ayacucho Department), to shipment areas where it is worth more.    Air, land, and river transportation are used to reach the  shipment "points."    From the shipment areas -- one of which was "El Diamante,"  Boca del Manu, in Madre de Dios Department -- the drugs are  taken to Colombia aboard small Colombian planes.    The 13 traffickers detained on 26 February during a combined  operation were interrogated yesterday by the Antidrug Division  (Dinandro) of the Peruvian National Police.</p>

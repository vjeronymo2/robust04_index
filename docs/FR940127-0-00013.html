			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency received a number of comments regarding the use of reserve accounts. The information published in the reserve section was basically the same as published in a separate, but related, prior rulemaking action on 7 CFR part 1930, subpart C. Changes resulting from that rulemaking action were separately addressed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The wording proposed at paragraph XIII B 2 c (2) of Exhibit B of part 1930, subpart C, is being adopted with a modification of the implementation date. The Agency is modifying the effective date to be 180 days after publication of the final rule instead of 60 days. This was deemed necessary because of the significant number of commentors who indicated that establishing accounts requiring countersignature by Agency officials would be cumbersome to implement, especially if implemented over a short timeframe. The Agency agrees and is providing for a longer implementation period. The paragraph also provides that reserve funds held just prior to the effective date, in instruments which are subject to monetary penalties for early withdrawal, may be temporarily held for the time needed to avoid such penalties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A comment was received concerning whether borrowers whose accounts were established on or before October 27, 1980, would be subject to a supervised account for reserve account funds, since these accounts were not subject to the required account standards set out in FmHA regulations for loans approved after October 27, 1980. The Agency intends all RRH, RCH, and all LH borrowers operating projects (e.g., all LH borrowers except on-farm type borrowers) to establish a supervised account for reserve funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments received in conjunction with the prior rulemaking changes for 7 CFR part 1930, subpart C, suggested reserve accounts be permitted to be invested in other than federally insured institutions and readily marketable obligations of the United States Treasury. The Agency agreed to make some expansion for MFH reserve accounts as prescribed in 7 CFR part 1930, subpart C. Consequently, it is necessary to make a number of technical changes to 7 CFR part 1902, subpart A to be compatible with these principles. Those changes would have necessitated extensive changes to numerous paragraphs in the existing regulation. Therefore, the Agency determined the public would be better served to have a separate section covering all regulations governing the MFH reserve accounts, instead of providing extensive exceptions in numerous sections of the existing regulation. Section 1902.4 was added to the regulation, taking into consideration the comments for improvements recommended by the public.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, a number of recommendations were offered to improve the technical implementation of any regulations resulting from the prior rulemaking action. Comments indicated that using the term ``bank statements'' when discussing MFH reserve accounts was not appropriate. The Agency agrees and avoided this wording when used in conjunction with MFH reserve accounts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A commentor also desired clarification as to whether originals or copies of account activity statements are expected. The Agency will accept either for MFH reserve accounts. A commentor also desired clarification as to when the MFH supervised account activity statements will be provided to the Agency. The Agency normally will not need account activity statements. Accordingly, the Agency made changes to clarify this intent. Commentors also were concerned about the need and frequency of providing MFH reserve account deposit information to the Agency. The Agency normally will not need deposit documentation. Accordingly, the Agency made changes to clarify this intent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It was recommended that proposed rulemaking wording for &sect;1902.1(k) be modified, since it states that the ``Interest-Bearing Deposit Agreement'' be executed in conjunction with Form FmHA 1940&hyph;1. The Agency agrees that the ``Interest-Bearing Deposit Agreement'' need not be executed when MFH reserve accounts are involved. The Agency avoided referencing this form when it consolidated all the MFH reserve account provisions in &sect;1902.4.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A commentor indicated that the proposed revision to &sect;1902.2(a)(6) is not appropriately located, and suggested adding another paragraph to cover the treatment of MFH accounts at &sect;1902.2(a). The Agency determined that the proposed clarifying wording is appropriate to ensure it is understood that MFH accounts are to be kept in supervised accounts as long as the borrower is indebted to the Agency. However, the Agency also agrees that additional coverage would help convey that MFH reserve funds must be withdrawn for disbursement for an authorized purpose. Consequently, the Agency consolidated these related provisions into &sect;1902.4.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

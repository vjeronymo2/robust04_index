			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OSHA also requested comment on whether hot work should be prohibited on insulated bulkheads and if so, whether all the insulation needed to be removed. The Agency asked whether there have been situations where toxic vapors have evolved from heated insulation, and whether fires have broken out during and after hot work operations. (53 FR 48102) A number of parties filed comments on this issue (e.g., 6&hyph;8, 6&hyph;12, 6&hyph;15, 6&hyph;18, 6&hyph;21, 6&hyph;22, 6&hyph;23, 6&hyph;24, 6&hyph;26, 6&hyph;31, 6&hyph;33, 6&hyph;34, 6&hyph;36, 6&hyph;37). These comments provided a wide range of views and some anecdotal information, but contained insufficient evidence to indicate that hot work on insulated bulkheads should be prohibited. Therefore, OSHA is not addressing this issue in subpart B. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (a)(1) requires a Marine Chemist or a U.S. Coast Guard authorized person to certify certain spaces as ``Safe for Hot Work'' before hot-work may be done on or in them. Other than the expansion of coverage to land-side, the requirements for hot work are the same as in the previous standard. However, &sect;1915.14 has been reorganized and editorial changes have been made to add clarity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (a)(1)(i), (a)(1)(ii) and (a)(1)(iii) list the confined and enclosed spaces and other dangerous atmospheres along with their adjacent spaces within shipyard employment that must be inspected and tested by a Marine Chemist or Coast Guard authorized person prior to hot work. OSHA has deleted all references to tank vessels and dry cargo, miscellaneous and passenger vessels because the scope now includes all vessels and vessel sections and land-side hot work activities. The requirements are unchanged from the previous requirements of 1915.14 (a)(1)(i), (a)(1)(ii), and (a)(1)(iii), but editorial changes have been made to add clarity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (a)(1)(iv) has been changed and relocated for clarity and consistency. In the previous rule, a Marine Chemist certificate was not necessary for hot work on dry cargo, miscellaneous, and passenger vessels when the work was performed on spaces adjacent to cargo tanks, as long as the gas or liquid in the tanks had a flash point below 150 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; Fahrenheit and the work was performed at least 25 feet (7.5 m) away from the tank. This exception has been expanded to any work in shipyards where the criteria are met, because the criteria are equally applicable to land-side operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (a)(2) carries forth the requirement that the certificate issued by the Marine Chemist or the Coast Guard authorized person be posted in the immediate vicinity of the affected area and kept on file for a period of at least 3 months from the date of completion of the operation for which the certificate was generated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (b) covers those areas of the vessel and land-side spaces within the shipyard where a competent person can give permission for hot work to proceed after he or she has inspected and tested the space or area for flammability. The substantive requirements of this paragraph remain unchanged from the previous requirements except that land-side confined and enclosed spaces and other dangerous atmospheres are now included. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (b)(1) states that hot work is not permitted in or on any of the listed spaces or adjacent spaces in &sect;1915.14(b)(1) (i) through (v) until the spaces have been tested for flammability and found to contain no concentrations of flammable vapors equal to or greater than 10 percent of the lower explosive limit. These spaces are: Dry cargo holds; the bilges; the engine or boiler room where a Marine Chemist's or a Coast Guard's authorized person's certificate is not required; vessels and vessel sections where a Marine Chemist or Coast Guard authorized person's certificate is not required under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section; and land-side enclosed or confined spaces or other dangerous atmospheres not covered in &sect;1915.14(a). The previous rule, in &sect;1915.14 (b) and (c), contains the same requirements found in &sect;1915.14(b)(1) (i) through (iv). Section 1915.15(b)(1)(v) extends the coverage to land-side operations within shipyard employment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In paragraph (b)(2), requires a space or adjacent space that has been tested and found to contain a concentration of flammable vapors equal to or greater than 10 percent of the lower explosion limit to be labeled Not Safe for Hot Work. The space or adjacent space must than be ventilated at volumes and flow rates sufficient to ensure that the vapor concentration is below 10 percent of the lower explosive limit. This requirement is unchanged from the previous &sect;1915.14 (b) and (c). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1915.14 (c) and (d) of the previous rule have been deleted because their contents have been moved to other places in subpart B. For example, hot work performed in engine and boiler rooms is now covered by paragraph (b)(1)(iii), and the hot work from open decks and tanks without overheads previously addressed by &sect;1915.14(d) is now covered in &sect;1915.14 (a) and (b). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The previous rule allowed the employer to inert spaces with non-flammable gas or water in shipbreaking operations. This provision was not included in the 1988 proposal and no commenters addressed this issue. OSHA is not carrying forth inerting as a specific provision because hot work on an inerted space must be approved by a Marine Chemist or Coast Guard authorized person. Work requiring a Marine Chemist's certificate is thoroughly covered in paragraph 1915.14(a) above. Finally &sect;1915.14 ends with a note referring users to Appendix A. Appendix A refers users to various other sections of part 1915 regulations that are directly relevant to hot work. Those sections, especially Subpart D, Welding, need to be reviewed carefully prior to starting hot work. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / E Europe told to set up model enterprises EASTERN European states should create model enterprises to serve as symbols of economic restructuring, a meeting of trade and industry ministers from eastern and western Europe, the US and Japan agreed yesterday. The proposal to create enterprises as a model for restructuring in the former communist economies came from Mr Yoshiro Mori, Japanese trade and industry minister. The conference, the second of ministers from the Group of Seven industrialised countries and states of the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe, discussed measures needed to attract foreign investment to eastern Europe, promote privatisation, develop legal, financial and accountancy systems, encourage the growth of small businesses and help defence factories convert to civilian production. The proposal for model enterprises will be studied by working groups over the next few months, before the third ministerial conference next year, to be held in Warsaw. The plan is to draw up comprehensive restructuring plans from which other enterprises could learn. The plans would cover every aspect of the enterprise, from production methods and product mix to marketing, sales, finance and foreign strategy. The summary of the conference's conclusions said that only some of the 12 conditions for attracting foreign investment, outlined at last year's conference, such as freedom to remit profits, had been satisfied. Business leaders at the conference outlined a long list of other conditions, such as acceptable living and working conditions for foreign staff and better telecommunications, so there shall be an increase in foreign investment. Mr Ron Brown, US commerce secretary, said there was growing support for the Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.5bn) privatisation fund which the US administration had first outlined at the G7 finance and industry ministers' meeting on Russia, in Tokyo two weeks ago.</p>

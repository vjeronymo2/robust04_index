			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The applications for multi-year funding should include a budget for the first budget period (not to exceed 12 months). If the application is approved, a grant will be awarded for the initial 12-month budget period. Funding will subsequently be provided for an additional 12-month budget period dependent on satisfactory performance of the initial budget period, continued relevance of the project, and the availability of FY funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is anticipated that up to $240,000 will be allocated to fund one or more projects under this priority area for the initial 12-month budget period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Issues Related to the Scheduled Increase in the Retirement Age_ORS&hyph;94&hyph;003  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Social Security Amendments of 1983 (Public Law 98&hyph;21) provide for a gradual increase in the age at which unreduced retired-workers benefits are first payable (for brevity, the retirement age) from 65 to 67 between the years 2000 and 2027. Benefits for retired workers still will be available at age 62, but the amount payable will be gradually reduced from the currently payable 80 percent of the unreduced benefit to 70 percent. It has further been proposed to speed up the phase-in to a higher retirement age, and to increase the retirement age to 68 (70 in one proposal). At least one proposal also increases the early retirement age to 65. (The executive summary of the report mandated by Congress and consultant reports were reprinted in the October 1986 and February 1987 issues of the Social Security Bulletin.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The increase in retirement age is based on the assumption that the increase in life expectancy has been accompanied by a corresponding improvement in health and capacity to work. But past studies are inconclusive about the relationship between longevity and work ability, especially among persons in their sixties. Proposals are sought to further investigate these relationships, using either new approaches, more current data, and/or new databases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One possible approach would be to use microdata collected by the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) to examine trends in health and ability to work. Data should be presented for subgroups of major interest for the retirement age issue (both early and normal retirement), subject to sampling error problems. A wide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> range of variables that measure health and ability to work should be included.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The retirement-age increase may also impact on the Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) program. Studies are needed to address questions such as: (i) what is the expected impact on the number of DI beneficiaries and their duration on the rolls and on the DI Trust Fund; (ii) how many workers would qualify for DI benefits at age 65 and 66 and how many would elect to receive benefits; and (iii) among those aged 62&hyph;64 who do not now elect to apply for DI benefits, how many might do so because of the additional reduction in benefits for early retirement that accompanies a retirement-age increase (including the elimination in some proposals of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> early <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  benefits for workers aged 62&hyph;64)?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Grant proposals must be based on well-developed, rigorous analysis. Applicants may submit applications for funding not to exceed 17 months in duration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The applications should include a budget for the total period of the grant (not to exceed 17 months). If the application is approved, a grant will be awarded for the entire budget period of the grant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is anticipated that up to $190,000 will be allocated to fund one or more projects for up to 17 months under this priority area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Analyses of the New Beneficiary Data System_ORS&hyph;94&hyph;004  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This project is intended to encourage research with the New Beneficiary Data System (NBDS) developed by SSA over the past decade to study the changing circumstances of aged and disabled beneficiaries. Based initially on a survey of new beneficiaries at the beginning of the 1980's, the dataset has been expanded with information from administrative records (on benefits, covered earnings, Supplemental Security Income, and Medicare) and followup interviews with survivors from the original survey. With the exception of the Medicare records, all administrative data have been obtained both for respondents and spouses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

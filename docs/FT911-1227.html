			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Brussels clears state aid for Greek steel company THE European Commission has taken the exceptional decision to approve state aid for a programme of investments by a Greek steel company, part of a shoal of small state aid cases passed by Brussels yesterday. Investment aid is normally forbidden in the steel sector, because it might increase capacity in a sector where the aim has been to limit EC production. However, investment aid targeted on a particular region, and which does not increase capacity, is allowed. Greece is the only member state to meet all the conditions applied to such aid and the Commission estimated that the aid to Halyvourgia Thessalias would not increase the company's production capacity. Brussels has also allowed France to renew for a further five years its tax on the clothing industry, aimed principally at raising money for research and training. The tax, which has existed since 1986, makes up 35 per cent of the annual resources of the Committee for Development and Promotion of the Textile and Clothing Industry, up to a figure of FFr57m (Pounds 5.7m). Sir Leon Brittan, the responsible commissioner, has also approved the renewal of a three-year aid programme for the Dutch shipbuilding industry, which falls under the 1990 shipbuilding directive; aid for research and development in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany; and German aid for riverside agricultural areas. The Commission has waved through three deals in the Italian and German steel industries: a merger between Stinnes Stahlhandel and Josef Stangl Eisengrosshandlung und Biegerei; a takeover of Industrie Cantieri Metallurgici Italiani by Ilva of Italy; and the formation of a joint-venture vehicle by Klockner Stahl, Agais Stahlhandel and Rautaruukkl of Germany.</p>

			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / UK Company News: An attempt at reviving the Habitat habit - Swedish owner wants the home furnishings chain to return to its roots MR VITTORIO Radice, managing director of Habitat UK, whips out a picture of six swarthy men intent on a serious game of boules. One lounges in a deck chair, munching his way through an overstuffed sandwich. 'This is what I use to describe what Habitat is all about,' Mr Radice says. Under the photograph is a single word - comfortable. Tomorrow Mr Radice hopes to paint a fuller picture of his vision for the home furnishings retail chain with something slightly more obvious - the opening of the revamped flagship store on the King's Road in Chelsea, London. Here in a 1930s cinema restored to its former Art Deco glory, he will attempt to convince customers that Habitat's future lies in recapturing its past. 'We have put one word back into the equation - passion,' he says. That philosophy is shared by Stichting Ingka, the trust set up by Mr Ingvar Kamprad, Sweden's guru of affordable chic and founder of the Ikea retailing phenomenon. It is almost a year to the day since the trust bought Habitat's European operations from Storehouse for Pounds 78m. Mr Kamprad, like his UK managing director, believes the way forward for Habitat lies in returning to its roots as a retailer of quality design furnishings at affordable prices. Recently he wrote to Sir Terence Conran, Habitat's founder, to reassure him that Stichting intended to revive the spirit behind that first shop he opened on Fulham Road in 1964. The mistakes of the past have been well documented. Sir Terence Conran's original concept lost its way in the mid- to late 1980s when new management sought to drive the company for dividend and volume growth. . While the continental businesses were left to follow their own path, the UK division had four management and strategy changes in six years, and made significant losses. There have been few changes since Stichting took over last year. Many of the most significant shifts - such as abandoning the out of town wastelands and returning Habitat to its high street roots - had already been launched by Mr Radice when he arrived from a Milanese furniture company in 1990. However, Stichting made what Mr Radice considers to be one of the most important decisions for the chain's future as an international brand. Within weeks of the takeover, Habitat's headquarters were moved from London to Paris. 'Now we are seriously working to make this one business,' Mr Radice says. 'A global view can only (be achieved) if we are run as one business.' The two divisions will share an increasing proportion of products and ranges in their catalogues. Habitat UK's catalogue is already showing a greater emphasis on the simple, timeless furniture for which Habitat was originally renowned and which the French business never abandoned. The design teams of both divisions are also encouraged to share the colour schemes and influences which form the basis of their furnishings. Shared sourcing and distribution are natural goals, which previously had been largely ignored. Now, says Mr Radice, Habitat is back on track to make significant profits and is more focused on the type of customer it wants to attract than it has been for years. 'We want a customer with some passion, some heart,' Mr Radice insists. 'One that has confidence to say THIS is the glass I like.' Comfort will be the driving force behind the product offer, rather than the creation of a stylised look such as that offered in Habitat catalogues of the 1980s. 'Ours is a catalogue of ideas,' Mr Radice says. 'That was a hardware catalogue.' Mr Radice says he is determined to recreate the atmosphere that made Sir Terence's stores so popular. 'It should be a place to meet, not to buy,' he says. Thus, the plans for an elegant but affordable cafe - Italian of course  -above the King's Road shop. Habitat's commitment to opening new shops in unusual sites - much as Sir Terence sought out churches and cinemas for his original stores - is also part of Mr Radice's Habitat revival. While most welcome the shift in emphasis which has become apparent over the last 18 months, there are those who warn of the dangers of becoming too focused on an image which does not have mass market appeal. 'There is a fine dividing line between being focused and limiting your potential,' says Ms Hilary Monk of the market research organisation Verdict. Sir Terence agrees. While praising the group's success in 'throwing off the Storehouse glooms', he says: 'It worries me that Habitat has given up some of the very straightforward, very everyday things we used to sell so success-fully.' For the moment, however, Mr Radice has other things on his mind; most immediately, the relaunch of the King's Road site. To commemorate the occasion, he is frantically searching for the desert epic with which the Gaumont Palace cinema opened in 1934 - The Camels are Coming. Mr Radice, a lively Italian proud of his unorthodox managerial methods, is also angling to make his entrance on the back of a camel. This time, however, the Stichting board may have other ideas.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Majority of Teenagers Have </F> Already Tried It"]    [Text] According to experts, drug consumption today in  Hungary corresponds to the West Germany of the 1970's.  Under-age people living in large cities are most at risk. In  this respect, Szeged is considered to be an especially dangerous  place. Szeged is a city along the Balkans drug route. The  border crossing points and their surrounding areas at Nagylak  and Roszke, the truck parking areas, and the market at Cserepes  street, and half a dozen entertainment places in the city are  intensely affected in the drug issue. Views differ on the  number of drug users. It is estimated between 300 and 700. Some  young people became drug addicts when glue-sniffing was in  fashion, others have become addicts in recent times. Their  number increases by some 50 each year. They mainly use cheap  natural materials--mainly poppy--as a base. One dry poppy head  costs 15 to 20 forints but the young people themselves can also  get hold of green poppy. Some buy cigarettes costing 300 to 400  forints. The spread of hard drugs is not yet typical.    Drug users usually enjoy the pleasure together, in  apartments, mostly with materials made by themselves. A small  number of known criminal cases are linked to drugs--some 12 of  the 7,000 last year. However, it is not a negligible fact that  more than half of the 14 to 18 age group has tried grass but in  some classes, 90 percent of children said the same. It is a big  problem that a large section of them see drugs as something  positive. Recently, three deaths occurred that were directly  linked with drugs. Prevention was first started in Szeged in  1987 by chief physician doctor Terez Farkasinszky, who has  earned undying credit nationally. The drug surgery is located  in Ujszeged at 4 Fesu street where, on average, 20 to 30 young  people are seen a day. Since November, a nationally unique  rehabilitation center has been operating in the area of isolated  farms at Deszk. Drug addicts who have gone through  detoxification can come here voluntarily if they accept that  they will not leave the institute for a year and will abide by  the conditions.</p>

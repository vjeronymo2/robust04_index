			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / 1867 and all that: British foreign policy has developed little over the past century John Major on Monday enjoyed a modest reprieve from unfavourable publicity when he hosted the launch of a four-power peace initiative for Bosnia. Whether this new international 'contact group' will bring peace is an open question. The good news is that the US, Russia, France and the UK will try to work together; the bad news is that their efforts will still depend on the goodwill and good sense of the Serbs, the Croats and the Bosnians. Since those two commodities have long been in short supply, it is probably not urgent for John Major to start ordering the champagne. What is doubly urgent, though, is for him to develop a plausible British strategy on Europe; and the first critical test of whether his government is even looking for such a strategy will be his meeting today with Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany. It is a critical summit because Germany will be setting the agenda for Europe in the second half of this year, when it takes over the presidency of the European Union; and this agenda, which it has said will include a high-pressure timetable for opening Europe to the east, will also hurry Europe towards uncomfortable choices over the dilemmas before the Union - over where it is going, what policies it should have, and what kinds of institutions it needs. Some people seem to think this will be a wonderful opportunity for turning the Union into a vast inter-governmental free trade area, without policies, with a much smaller budget and much weaker institutions. That is obviously one kind of European model; and perhaps it is the kind of Europe which would, ideally, most appeal to the UK government. It is the kind of Europe the UK tried to get in the 1950s; it failed. But in today's world there are two relevant questions. First, has this kind of Europe the smallest chance of acceptance by most member states? Second, and more important, is the British government prepared for an open struggle to bring it about? The historical answer to the first question is clear: the founding members and most subsequent members have consistently preferred a more politically integrated Europe. They may change their minds. But we see how many European electorates are disillusioned with their national political systems and the EU because of unemployment and other deprivations perceived as having been brought about by widespread economic 'restructuring'. Is it plausible to suppose that most member states will be eager to throw away those parts of the EU system, such as the Social Fund and social legislation, which are designed to mitigate some of the inequalities of the free market? Moreover, is it plausible to suppose that they will endorse a Europe advocated by Britain? The second question is more relevant because, if the British government really wants to fight for a different kind of Europe, it should get ready for the fray right away, with a coherent concept and a feasible strategy. Any struggle over the future of Europe will certainly come no later than the Inter-Governmental Conference of 1996 for revising the Maastricht treaty; and it may come much sooner through German pressure to open to the east. As of now, the UK does not appear ready for any uncomfortable choices. It has just retreated ignominiously from a fatuous crusade over majority voting, which was not just unwinnable but damaging to Britain's position in Europe. But it appears to have drawn no strategic lessons from this narrowly-avoided crisis. In the absence of a European manifesto, something it dare not publish, the Conservative party appears hopelessly divided on Europe, and its strategy is limited to empty rhetoric in the hope that future choices can be finessed. The oddity is that Britain has long enjoyed a luminous reputation for the profundity and Machiavellian skill of its foreign policy; and people say that Mr Douglas Hurd is the greatest foreign secretary in living memory. Is this just an illusion? Walter Bagehot, the great 19th century editor of The Economist chiefly remembered for his analysis of the English constitution, also had trenchant things to say about British foreign policy. Here* he examines the reasons why it is 'not so good as it should be': 'There are two great causes at work,' he says. 'The first of these causes is our ignorance . . . On many parts of our administration the effect of our extreme ignorance is at once plain. The foreign policy of England has for many years been, according to the judgment now in vogue, inconsequent, fruitless, casual; aiming at no distinct pre-imagined end, based on no steadily preconceived principle . . . I entirely concede that our recent foreign policy has been open to very grave and serious blame. 'But would it not have been a miracle if the English people, directing their own policy, and being what they are, had directed a good policy? Are they not above all nations divided from the rest of the world, insular both in situation and in mind, both for good and for evil? Are they not out of the current of common European causes and affairs? Are they not a race contemptuous of others? Are they not a race with no special education or culture as to the modern world, and too often despising such culture? 'Who could expect such a people to comprehend the new and strange events of foreign places?' It appears that little has really changed since 1867. * The English Constitution; by Walter Bagehot; Introduction by Richard Crossman; Fontana Press; Pounds 7.99</p>

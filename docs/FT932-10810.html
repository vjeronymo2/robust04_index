			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Kiev row over rise in fuel prices THE UKRAINIAN parliament yesterday moved to block big domestic energy price rises by imposing a moratorium on the increases until May 18, when the government's powers to rule by decree will run out. Mr Viktor Pynzenyk, deputy prime minister and architect of the government's economic reforms, told the legislature its ban on price rises - resulting from higher rates Ukraine must pay for Russian oil and gas - had no legal validity. His assertion reflects a dispute between parliament and government about the extent of the government's authority to rule by decree. In the face of increases in the cost of Russian fuel, Ukraine had no choice but to raise domestic prices, he said. Russian officials have said that later this month they will increase the price Ukraine pays for gas by 50 per cent, bringing it to within 60 per cent of world prices. The Ukrainian government boosted electricity prices fivefold and raised coal prices by up to 300 per cent. Mr Ivan Herts, minister for foreign economic relations, said he was preparing to shift to world prices in all trade with Russia on July 1. Russian President Boris Yeltsin yesterday promised a purge of officials who opposed his reforms and said he wanted parliamentary elections to be held this year, Reuter reports from Moscow. Mr Yeltsin said the referendum was the green light for reforms being hindered by the conservative parliament headed by chairman Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov. He said senior officials were blocking reforms and he would instruct Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and heads of regional administrations across the country to review the performance of their employees. 'Those who do not share our aims should simply leave so as not to interfere with our work,' he said.</p>

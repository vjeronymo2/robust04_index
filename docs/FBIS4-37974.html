			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Yemeni Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim </F> Basindwah by Salah Salamah in Paris on 26 June -- recorded]    [Text] [Salamah] The latest reports from the war front say  the northern forces have captured the coastal road that  separates Aden from the oil refinery and the electricity power  plant. This means advancing militarily to tighten the siege on  the capital of southern Yemen. Do you really intend to storm  Aden and take it militarily?    [Basindwah] We do not need to take Aden militarily. Our  forces, the forces of legitimacy and unity, are in Aden itself.  We believe that the rebels are now trying to take refuge behind  the defenseless citizens. The recapturing of these parts of  Aden did not take place following the cease-fire, but before it.  I believe that those who want to save the citizens from this  tribulation should bring new pressure to bear on the remaining  rebels to give themselves up to the legitimate authorities or to  leave the homeland for good.    [Salamah] Mr. Muhammad Salim Basindwah, the new cease-fire  agreement, like all previous agreements, did not hold today.  Who is responsible for the cease-fire violation?    [Basindwah] We invited the U.S. and the French military  attaches and news agency correspondents to go, to look for  themselves, and to determine which party did not abide by the  cease-fire and continued to violate this decision. I believe  that the U.S. and French friends have collected information that  the forces of legitimacy abided by the cease-fire, which entered  into force at 2400 last night and that the party that did not  abide by the cease-fire is the rebel group or those who remain  from this group and who are taking shelter behind the  defenseless civilians.    [Salamah] It is being said that if the fighting continues  the  UN Security Council will issue a new resolution, which was  drafted by the United Kingdom with the assistance of Saudi  Arabia, to impose cease-fire by force. What is the position of  the leadership in Sanaa on the regional and international  pressure to halt the war and encourage dialogue to seek a  peaceful solution to the conflict?    [Basindwah] We want a cease-fire not because we fear this or  that party, or the United Nations. We want a cease-fire because  we are more concerned than others over the lives of women,  children, the elderly, and the sick. However, things must be  spelled out. The party that has rejected the cease-fire must be  specified as well as those who have interests in exacerbating  the situation. Of course, those who benefit from the exchange  of fire are the rebels, who believe their end is near. It would  have been better for them had they surrendered to the legitimate  authorities or left the homeland when the al-'Anad base fell,  after they lost the battle. But, they do not want to spare the  people further tribulation.    [Salamah] Some reports published in the Gulf say that about  18 Arab and European countries are prepared to recognize the  proclaimed state in south Yemen if the war does not stop. This  means giving legitimacy to the new situation in the country.  What is Sanaa's position on the recognition of the southern  state?    [Basindwah] For our part, we are committed to the  cease-fire.  I think the U.S. and French military attaches can reaffirm this.  As for recognition that aims to fragment Yemen, this does not  harm us at all because the recognition will be one on paper, but  on the ground unity is an established fact that no one can harm  or fragment through recognition. We heard in the past about  governments-in-exile but we have not heard about  states-in-exile. This, as I believe, will be the first time in  human history that a state-in-exile is recognized while it has  no presence on the Yemeni land because, God willing, Yemen will  remain united.    [Salamah] Muhammad Salim Basindwah, President 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih has dispatched several envoys to the Arab countries to  explain the Yemeni position, and the same thing was done by the  proclaimed government in the south. So far, the Arab efforts  have failed to stop the war, arrange dialogue, or safeguard  Yemeni unity. What are the reasons that led to this Arab  failure, and how can this paralysis in the general Arab position  on the Yemeni crisis be treated?    [Basindwah] Of course, the problem in the Arab situation is  not a new one. It is an old problem, and we all know its  reasons. What is important is that Yemeni unity is safeguarded  and the people who realized the unity on 22 May 1990 are able to  preserve this unity. Of course, we want the Arab countries to  help convince the rebels to refrain from bringing more suffering  to the people and to surrender themselves or to leave the  homeland. We are confident that it is merely a question of  time, and the rebels are heading to their end sooner or later.  I think that the next days will witness their end one after  another.    [Salamah] Muhammad Salim Basindwah, you are in Paris. Have  you asked the French Government to play a role in expediting the  resolution of the crisis in Yemen?    [Basindwah] I am in Paris on a private visit. I did not meet  with any officials, but I may return to Paris by the end of this  week, which begins tomorrow, to meet with French officials. We  greatly appreciate the just and honorable French position. We  will continue to be grateful to France for this position, which  really shows that France is a friendly country, and we will  always remain keen on our friendship with France.    [Salamah] The United States has warned the leadership in  Sanaa against storming Aden and urged it to withdraw  emplacements from around the city. Did you contact the U.S.  Administration after the warning, or are you moving toward an  open diplomatic confrontation of the United States following  reports that it is escalating its position?    [Basindwah] We are eager to avoid any diplomatic or  nondiplomatic confrontation with the United States and any other  party. But I would like to tell you that our eagerness not to  storm Aden is not due to fear from that or this state. Rather,  it is due to our concern about the bloodshed and property of the  sons of our people inside the city of Aden. As you know, when  the rebels lost the battle on the various battlefronts, they  took refuge in the city of Aden and used the unarmed families as  shields. Of course, we cannot expose the citizens to killing,  but we pin great hope on the them that they will expel these  rebels from their ranks and prevent them from using families as  shields. There is no need to storm Aden militarily. We are  completely confident that the citizens themselves will help the  legitimate forces spread the state's authority over all the  governorate of Aden and inside Aden quarters without resorting  to armed force, God willing.    [Salamah] So, the war will continue, and you still reject  regional and international pressures and setting conditions for  a dialogue with officials from the south. As a result, there is  a suffocating crisis from which no hint of a solution in the  country is seen. What are the available opportunities to  achieve a political settlement in Yemen apart from this  destructive war?    [Basindwah] There is no problem at all in reaching a  solution  if only the world can be convinced that there is a group of  rebels that wants to disrupt Yemen's unity and does not want to  bow to order, law, and constitutional legitimacy. The other  sides are required to persuade this rebellious, renegade group  to hand itself over to the legitimate authority and have a fair  trial or to leave the homeland and let people live in peace.  You know that the government in Yemen is legitimate and derives  its legitimacy from the free and fair elections held on 27 April  of last year. The world recognized the results of these  elections, and even the rebels themselves accepted them before  declaring their rebellion.    I can't see any government that came to power following  fair and free elections allowing any of its citizens to foment a  state of rebellion against it. It doesn't stand to reason that  the international community should extend recognition to the  rebels as a state or authority. We have not done anything  wrong, nor perpetrated any crime. All that we want is for law  and order to prevail throughout Yemen and for the rebels to  bring their rebellion to a halt, then everything will be fine.    [Salamah] Do you think this will open the road to dialogue  and to a return to a harmonious relationship, without anyone  standing trial?    [Basindwah] I don't think it is right to be lenient toward  those who have caused hundreds of civilians and soldiers to be  martyred or wounded in the hostilities. Who is the culprit?  The culprits must be held accountable for what they have done.  It is not right just to let things pass without the guilty  party being called to account. There are unionist elements  within the [Yemeni] Socialist Party and these have had no hand  in what has happened. We have nothing against them and they are  welcome to resume their positions. All of us will reach out to  them.    [Salamah] Would you name names?    [Basindwah] I know many of them, but I would rather not name  names now, if only not to embarrass them.    [Salamah] Thank you for being with us, Foreign Minister  Muhammad Salim Basindwah of Yemen.    [Basindwah] I thank you and Radio Monte Carlo.</p>

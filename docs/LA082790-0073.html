			<p><P> August 27, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN, YOUNG SON TELL OF HARROWING ESCAPE  </P> <P> It wasn't the quicksand that was so frightening. Or the sandstorms. Or the oil  pipelines that loomed suddenly out of the blowing sand.  </P> <P> It was the tanks.  </P> <P> "We were afraid the tanks would fire at us and that would be it," said Bassam  Mohtady, an American who, with his 8-year-old son, crossed the Kuwaiti desert  in a caravan of vehicles led by a local Bedouin guide.  </P> <P> "It was like cat and mouse in the desert," added Mohtady, 34, who arrived with  his son, Sammer, in Boston on Sunday.  </P> <P> The 21-vehicle caravan left Kuwait city at 6 a.m. on Aug. 16. Twelve hours  later, only six vehicles crossed into Saudi Arabia. Mohtady said he does not  know the fate of the 60 other travelers -- mostly Kuwaitis, Egyptians and  Saudis -- who did not make it to the border.  </P> <P> Since Iraq invaded Kuwait 24 days ago, thousands of Kuwaitis and foreign  nationals have risked the perils of the desert to escape the Iraqi occupation.  Not all have survived.  </P> <P> "We passed by abandoned cars, some with bodies in them," Mohtady, manager of  the World Book Encyclopedia office in Kuwait city, recalled in a telephone  interview from his home in Saugus, Mass. But "no one was willing to stop" to  find out how they died, he said.  </P> <P> The first four vehicles dropped out of the caravan in a sandstorm a few hours  into the trip. Others became so hopelessly mired in quicksand that the power of  three Jeeps could not extricate them. Some simply decided that the dunes and  hardscrabble desert were too dangerous and turned around.  </P> <P> But Mohtady, driving in a Jeep with his son, a Kuwaiti professor and the  professor's two American children, kept on. His passengers played electronic  games to pass the time and drank cold water to offset the 130-degree heat.  </P> <P> They traversed deep ditches dug by the Iraqis to prevent escaping vehicles from  going farther. They drove for miles along oil pipelines looking for places  where enough sand had piled up against the 3-foot-high pipes so that the  caravan could cross over.  </P> <P> The worst moment came when the caravan was surrounded by Iraqi tanks. "They had  a big circle around us," Mohtady's son, Sammer, recalled. But a providential  sandstorm rose up off the desert, obscured the Jeeps and cars from the tank's  viewfinders, "and we just went through them," he said.  </P> <P> The caravan did not escape gunfire, however. As the few remaining vehicles  approached the Kuwaiti border, an Iraqi Jeep patrol opened fire on them with  machine guns.  </P> <P> Although bullets broke Mohtady's windows, no one was injured, he said.  </P> <P> After passing through the Saudi border checkpoint, the caravan split up.  Mohtady drove on to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, where he abandoned the  Jeep and bought tickets home to the States. He and his son were greeted by his  wife, Kathleen, when they arrived at Boston's Logan International Airport.  </P> <P> Mohtady, who was born in Kuwait but is a naturalized American citizen, said he  ventured the escape in part because of frustration with the options available.  The day before he left, the U.S. Embassy held a meeting in which Americans were  advised to sit tight and keep in touch with each other by telephone. Mohtady  had been serving as a warden responsible for staying in contact with 17 other  Americans.  </P> <P> After the meeting Mohtady became disheartened. "I was putting so much hope on  them (the embassy) to get us out of there," he recalled. "But since they had no  plans to get us out of there, I had to make my own."  </P> <P> He said that when he left 10 days earlier, no Americans were suffering from  food shortages and were mostly free to travel within the city. Kuwaitis and  foreigners alike were congregating in a few apartments with family and friends  and most homes were abandoned. The day Mohtady left, Iraq ordered foreigners to  report to hotels, although most ignored the order.  </P> <P> For the first two weeks of the invasion, "I never planned to go to Saudi  Arabia," he said. "But I knew that if I stayed in Kuwait I was history and that  if I left, at least I had a chance."  </P> <P> His son is less philosophical about the escape. "It was fun," he said.  </P></p>

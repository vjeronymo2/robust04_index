Speaking to journalists in Parliament at a press conference  broadcast by Hungarian Radio, the president said the second free  elections would, perhaps, be even more important than the first,  as they will prove the continuity of democracy.    Inasmuch as the second election in the switch to a civil  democratic order will be clean and moderate, it will also  provide a good report card on Hungarian democracy, Goncz said.    The president called on the country's population to ensure a  significant turnout at the elections.</p>

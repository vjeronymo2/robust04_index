			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Interim losses cut at Clinton Cards CLINTON CARDS, which claims 7.5 per cent of the greetings cards market, against WH Smith's 7 per cent, reduced pre-tax losses from Pounds 1.29m to Pounds 956,000 in the six months to July 31. Losses per share emerged at 3.66p (4.94p); the interim dividend, however, is lifted to 1.6p (1.5p). The shares fell 4p to 161p. Mr Don Lewin, chairman, said that as long as the group had been expanding the number of its outlets, first-half losses had been traditional. During the six months, it opened 18 shops, bringing the total to 272. Mr Lewin said the expansion 'was not slowing down, just cautious'. Mr Barry Hartog, finance director, added that the additional shops had been mostly on high streets and not in shopping centres, so there had been little in the way of reverse premiums, which the group no longer enters into the profit and loss account. Turnover, including VAT, rose to Pounds 37.6m (Pounds 33.3m). Operating losses shrank to Pounds 770,000 (Pounds 897,000). Net interest payable was Pounds 186,000 (Pounds 393,000) - the group does not reveal borrowings figures at the half-way stage, but Mr Hartog said they were down 40 per cent over last time, though they peak in October in the run-up to Christmas, the group's most important trading period. Mr Lewin reckoned that any upturn in the UK economy had been patchy. The amount that customers - more than 80 per cent of whom are women - spend had remained stable, but the group depends on 'footfall': if the high streets are emptier, then fewer customers cross the shops' thresholds.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Ma Zhiping: "Industries Bring Big Rewards to Rural </F> Towns"]    [Text] About 10 per cent of China's rural towns have become  relatively well-off thanks to the development of rural  industries, say the latest statistics.    Reports from the State Statistics Bureau (SSB) say 4,989 of  China's 50,000 towns achieved an agricultural and industrial  output value of more than 100 million yuan (about $11.5 million)  each in 1992.    Four hundred and thirty scored 500 million yuan (some $57.5  million).    And 72 of them managed more than 1 billion yuan (some $115  million).    Most of these well-off towns are in the coastal areas of the  Southeast, where rapid economic growth has been achieved over  the past decade.    According to the list worked out by the statistics bureau,  944 rich towns are in East China's Jiangsu Province, 892 in  Shandong also in East China, more than 500 in Zhejiang and  another 425 in South China's Guangdong.    Experts said the survey showed up the disparity between the  economic growth in different areas of China.    However, they stressed it was encouraging that  100-million-yuan towns have sprung up in relatively poor areas,  especially in Western parts of China, such as Guizhou Province  and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, which has two towns in the  top-500.    This improvement was a result of the State's efforts in  recent years to narrow the gap between China's east and west.    The State handed out 5,000 million yuan ($575 million) in  loans last year to support the development of rural enterprises  in inland areas, while local governments produced a number of  preferential policies, said China Business Times.    As a result, the total annual output value of township  enterprises in 20 inland provinces and regions was 400 billion  yuan about $46 billion) last year, about 60 per cent more than  1992.    China's top 10 towns are: Caigongzhuang in Tianjin;  Qianzhou, Shengze, Luoshe and Zhouzhuang in Jiangsu; Beivao and  Guizhou in Guangdong; Ninghai in Shandong; Xinzhaize in  Liaoning; and Maqiao in Shanghai.    Experts say the growth of these wealthy towns is an  indication of improvement in China's rural economy since the  country began its reforms in 1979.    Statistics show more than 20 per cent of the rural  population  live in "100-million-yuan towns."    They also showed these towns produced half the country's  agricultural output value and two thirds of its output value  from rural industries.    Booming rural industries have been the biggest contributors  to the development of the wealthy towns, the statistics show.    Non-agricultural production accounted for 88 per cent of the  towns' total output value, about 24 percent higher than the  country's average.    Meanwhile, a small number of them are close to becoming  industrial centres, with 96 per cent of their wealth coming from  non-agricultural production.    The output value of township enterprises in these prosperous  communities made up 52 per cent of the country's total.</p>

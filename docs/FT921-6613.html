			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Restrictions lifted on foreign banks FOREIGN banks are being given virtually free rein to set up branches or subsidiaries in Australia, and buy into the smaller domestic trading banks. The move is part of a sweeping banking reform including changes to the treatment of non-bank financial institutions and to the tax treatment of banks' bad debts. The lifting of curbs on the number of foreign banks is a follow-on to the government's 1985 deregulatory push, which allowed entry to only 15 foreign banks. Under the 1985 policy, licences were granted only to foreign bank subsidiaries. Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, said the rationale for limiting the number had lost its force. He expected foreign banks to raise the efficiency of the Australian financial system by providing competition, especially in business lending and in credit risk assessment. Under changes to be introduced in the Banking Act, foreign branches' activities will be confined to wholesale banking. Retail banking will be allowed in locally-incorporated subsidiaries. Foreign branches will not have to maintain 'endowed capital' in Australia, nor be subject to the Reserve Bank's limits on capital-based exposure. But they will still be subject to Reserve Bank liquidity and prudential requirements. To put more foreign institutions under Reserve Bank control, exemptions enjoyed by money market companies calling themselves merchant banks will be revoked. Under present rules, merchant banks are outside the Reserve Bank's prudential control. About 90 foreign institutions conduct banking or quasi-banking businesses, of which 17 operate as authorised banks. Over 50 operate as merchant banks.</p>

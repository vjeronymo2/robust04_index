			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Committee boost to top pay seen CHIEF EXECUTIVES whose pay is determined by remuneration committees are paid nearly 20 per cent more than colleagues at companies without such arrangements, according to a report which will fuel the debate over the role of non-executive directors. The study, led by Professor Brian Main of Edinburgh University's economics department and published in today's Personnel Management magazine, is based on a survey of 220 of the UK's largest companies, 67 of which were identified as having a remuneration sub-committee of the board. The establishment of remuneration committees was one of the main recommendations of the recent Cadbury committee report on corporate governance. The research by Prof Main and Mr James Johnston, a research fellow colleague, found that the average chief executive salary was Pounds 313,500 in companies with remuneration committees and Pounds 245,700 in those without them. With the value of executive stock options added, the figures were Pounds 1.15m against Pounds 930,000 in favour of companies with remuneration committees. In an additional article in the magazine, Prof Main and Mr Johnston say the challenge to committees is 'not so much to hold pay levels down as to structure pay in a way that provided the maximum incentive by linking pay to performance'. The study, however, found no significant difference in the proportion of options, one gauge of performance pay, in the executives' remuneration package. It also found that a chief executive whose compensation committee includes non-executive directors who are particularly well paid by their own company is likely to be paid more in turn. The authors conclude that 'merely setting up a remuneration committee is no answer to the problem of controlling top executive pay'. It adds: 'At the moment in Britain, these committees seem to do little more than legitimise generous pay awards. In general, these findings suggest that innovations in corporate governance do not promise an immediate or radical transformation in the way top executives are paid.' The report says attention should be paid to the way non-executive directorships are filled. 'There is clear scope for greater shareholder activism, both in demanding greater disclosure of the nature of the deliberations of the committees and by securing non-executive directorships for shareholder representatives.' The survey found that remuneration committees were more common among larger companies - 40 per cent among those with an annual turnover of more than Pounds 1.5bn and 17 per cent among those with less than Pounds 500m. Less than half of the 67 remuneration committees were totally free of executive membership. There were many cases where executives sat on the committee that determined their own pay.</p>

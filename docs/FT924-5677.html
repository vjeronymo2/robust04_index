			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Survey of Derbyshire (3):  Built within schedule and budget  -Toyota, The Burnaston plant / Phase One THE construction by Toyota of its Pounds 700m car assembly plant at the former Burnaston airfield close to Derby is a success - even before the first cars have been produced. The world's third-largest vehicle manufacturer has been very pleased with the performance of the UK contractors which have built the first phase of one of Europe's biggest industrial complexes. More than 50 separate sub-contractors and 2,500 workers have been employed on Britain's second-largest private sector building project after the Canary Wharf office development in London's former docklands. The plant, covering more than 200,000 sq metres incorporated more than 20,000 tonnes of steel, The first phase of the Burnaston plant, completed earlier this year within the original schedule and budget, will allow Toyota to manufacture up to 100,000 cars a year by late 1995. Production of the first Carina E 1600 and 1800 saloons are due to start on December 16. A second phase of development at the plant, largely investment in more machinery rather than additional construction, will allow the group to produce 200,000 cars a year by 1997-98. Because of the need to get the plant open and running as soon as a possible designs had to be developed as construction was taking place. This required a high degree of co-operation between client, designers, project managers and the large numbers of separate sub-contractors involved in a large project such as this. The project, according to builders and engineers who worked on the plant, provided a lesson in how construction contracts should be organised for a British industry which in the past has been criticised for failing to deliver on time and within budget. Mr Bernard Ainsworth of Laing Management, part of the building and civil engineering group and project director for the Toyota plant, says: 'It is helpful when there is a well-organised client which knows clearly what it wants and is prepared to work closely with contractors to achieve its aims.' Toyota, which employed Shimizu of Japan as contract administrator, has had a senior construction team permanently on site with the authority to react immediately to problems without having to refer continually to higher management. This removed some of the possible causes for delay, says Mr Ainsworth. There was a preference to employ sub-contractors which had previously worked together harmoniously. Mr Ainsworth says: 'Following the lead of Toyota and Shimizu, we did not simply accept the lowest tender but looked for the best price for the job as a whole. 'The aim was to develop a close-knit construction team which, although employed by separate companies in different professional disciplines, was able to forge a common purpose to benefit the project as a whole and not just their individual companies.' To promote team spirit and ensure that different trades were kept fully informed of development progress and of any potential delays, there was a regular and free flow of information. Individual subcontractors met the project manager and representatives from Toyota and Shimizu at least once a week. Each meeting lasted between one and two hours and was attended by only a small number of senior managers so as not to delay construction. There were also formal weekly co-ordination meetings, attended by all the sub-contractors working on site, which lasted about 45 minutes. 'The aim was to make sure everybody knew what was going on and could plan for problems which might have a knock-on effect on their part of the project,' says Mr Ainsworth. The result has been a rate of construction at the Derby plant which has matched the best times achieved by contractors in Japan. Disputes between main and sub-contractors have been fewer than would normally be expected on a project of this size and complexity. The decision to start construction before designs had been completed meant that sub-contractors had to be sufficiently flexible to cope with late-breaking designs and changes to the schedule. Wetter-than-expected ground conditions, for example, led to an early decision to double the number of concrete piles from 1,100 to 2,200. This meant employing an extra contractor at short notice to help with the work. The extra cost, running into several million pounds, was absorbed into the original budget by finding savings in other parts of the project. A temporary ring-main, involving half a kilometre of piping, had to be installed to help drain the site of the paint shop. Mr Ainsworth says: 'Because we had prepared carefully, we were ready to cope with this sort of contingency. We could react swiftly to overcome problems. Moreover, we knew we had the support of our sub-contractors.' In another case, the lay-out of the assembly shop was changed just before foundations were due to be dug. This meant bringing forward other works. This type of last-minute rescheduling can be very costly and could lead to substantial claims for extra payment from sub-contractors affected. In this case, the issue was resolved swiftly and no time was lost.</p>

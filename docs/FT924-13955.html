			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Big rise in Japanese individual defaults JAPAN'S banks yesterday reported a sharp increase in individual payment defaults, with 171,613 cases in the first eight months, up 63 per cent on the same period last year. The figures are generally interpreted as an indicator of personal bankruptcies, and the rise this year continues a trend begun in 1989, when the number of cases rose 29 per cent. In 1990, following the collapse of stock prices, cases increased 54 per cent. The Federation of Bankers' Associations of Japan said the increase this year was linked to the continuing weakness of stock prices, which had undermined the asset base of some families, and a rise in credit card delinquency. Individual Japanese are generally thought to have weathered successfully the economic downturn, but the banks say that rates of borrowing compared to net income have increased sharply, while overtime earnings have fallen. A continuing surge in individual bankruptcies would suggest that consumers are more burdened by debt than the Economic Planning Agency has reckoned, and are less able to lead an economic recovery.</p>

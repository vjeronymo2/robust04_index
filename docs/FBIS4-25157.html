			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Feng Chien 7458 0051: "Deng Xiaoping Talks </F> Again About Arrangements After His Death"]    [Text] Confronted with the actual conditions that capital  construction has continued to expand, inflation remaining high,  and living standards of staffers and workers having somewhat  worsened since the beginning of this year, it is said that the  CPC top echelon continues to focus in the near future on scaling  down capital construction, exercising strict control over the  scope of credit, lowering the inflation rate, and firmly  grasping agricultural production as well as "non-staple food  supply engineering" in urban areas. According to State Council  Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, the key to the success or failure of  reform and development this year lies in whether or not a good  job is done of reducing the inflation rate and the scope of  capital construction, whether or not mass sentiment, especially  of workers and staffers at state-owned enterprises suffering  deficits, will be stabilized. With a good job done in those two  aspects, reform and development in the second half of the year  will enjoy comparatively smooth progress. To fulfill the  aforementioned targets, the CPC top echelon is sparing no effort  to conduct macroeconomic regulation and control by resorting to  administrative means, while slowing the pace of reform for the  time being. Economists' estimates show that despite the fact  that the CPC top echelon continues to adopt a "soft landing"  policy, which has been in practice since the second half of  1993, in handling economic issues this year to prevent an  excessive drop in the growth rate, should economic growth and  inflation rates remain too high, the CPC top echelon is likely  to adopt control measures of greater magnitude than last year,  even though Zhu Rongji himself is unwilling to resort to such  measures.  <H5>  Deng Xiaoping's New Instruction on Economic Construction </H5>   A resourceful figure disclosed that one opinion on the  mainland believes that responsibility for the economy being  "overheated" should be assigned to Deng Xiaoping's talks made  during his southern inspection tour; Deng had approved of a 6  percent growth rate, which he later contradicted in the wake of  his talks made during this tour. Furthermore, Deng Xiaoping  insistently stressed decentralization, "filling ponds with water  to breed fish" [fang shui yang yu 2397 3055 7402 7625]; as a  result, central control was reduced, the regional imbalance in  economic development aggravated, and the momentum of blind  expansion in various localities went out of control.    Such opinion had been collected and reported to Deng  Xiaoping, who did not say anything about it right away.  However, not long ago, while talking about other issues,  Deng Xiaoping said: "Taking economic construction as the key,"  reform and opening up, and "development is the last word" [fa  zhan shi ying dao li 4099 1455 2508 4289 6670 3810], these three  points are the essentials of what I have advocated; practice  demonstrates that there is nothing wrong with those three  points, which have won popular support. To my mind, no major  problems will surface should the third generation of CPC leaders  persist in these three points. As to the question of whether or  not the central authorities should have greater power or less, I  have not shaped a clear picture in my mind yet. However, this  issue should be judged by three criteria, namely, whether or not  it is helpful to social productive force development, improving  comprehensive national strength, and improving people's living  standards. No rules should be generally stipulated. For many  years, we have not found a satisfactory solution to this issue.  In his days, Chairman Mao wanted to resolve the issue; however,  the result was overly rigid centralization which affected  development. In the wake of the Third Session of the 11th  Central Committee, we have changed past practice; consequently,  the economy improved. Today, the issue has once again become  conspicuous, where lies the knot of the issue? That is a point  leading members of the third generation must resolve. In my  opinion, historical lessons and experiences should not be  neglected; on the other hand, problems should be investigated  and resolved from the angle of reform and development. I have  long set out that the central leadership must have authority;  that is one of our political advantages. The problem today is  that it does not enjoy sufficient authority; at the same time,  the enthusiasm of localities has not been given full play.  Primarily it is necessary to have a clear picture of the  differences between the two aspects. I do not have much energy  left now, and other old comrades are not working in the  forefront. I am afraid all we can do is offer some suggestions,  and we must rely on younger comrades to resolve the issue.  Younger comrades should make new accomplishments; it is quite  beyond us old people to take their place.    Regarding Deng Xiaoping's aforementioned words, figures of  political and economic circles made the following analyses: 1)  Deng is sober-minded, has his own criteria in understanding the  situation, and does not fully approve of current practices; and  2) Deng Xiaoping is, perhaps, still examining "leading members  of the third generation." However, it is quite beyond him now;  he pins his hopes on leading members of the third generation  maturing and growing up as quickly as possible.    Some source has it that Deng Xiaoping has recently  told his family members: Do not see my personal role being so  great; it is far from being so in reality. When Chairman Mao  passed away, was it not true that the sky did not fall! Now  everyday the outside world is saying that I am dead or on my  death bed. When things like that are repeated too often, people  will get used to it. The key lies in the fact that we have taken  the right path and the economy has developed. No matter how big  my role is said to be, it is merely mediocre?! The sky won't  fall, even if it should fall, there is always someone to support  it.  <H5>  The Present Situation Is Characterized by "Political </H5> Tightening Up, Economic Toughening Up"    To generalize the mainland situation today in a popular  saying, perhaps it is appropriate to quote the phrase "political  tightening up, economic toughening up." The CPC top echelon  have all along persisted in "political tightening up" over the  past few years. To maintain the CPC status of absolute  leadership, the top echelon first talked about "reform" of the  political structure, but now they have confined themselves to  talking about "completion and perfection" only, and retrogressed  to canceling the political reform plan characterized by  "separation of the party and government" formulated at the CPC  13th Party Congress, while basically resorting to the  traditional political structure corresponding to the traditional  planned economy to deal with economic restructuring. It is only  since the second half of 1993 that the top echelon began to pay  attention to and augment the policy of "economic toughening up,"  with its fundamental characteristic of augmenting central  macroeconomic control and regulation as well as a central  dominant role in finance, with more power relegated to  localities redistributed in the name of "reform" to undergo  recentralization. Prior to this, the CPC implemented a "soft  economic" policy in reform, basically characterized by  relegating power to localities and enterprises to develop the  market economy. The simultaneous implementation of "soft" and  "tough" policies in economic reform has shown that the CPC has  greater room for choice and comparatively greater freedom in  reform in the economic arena. Reviewing the entire progress of  reform over the past dozen of years or so, the basic CPC  strategy was to center on the traditional political structure to  push economic marketization and liberalization. Namely, "to  promote being `soft' [in the economy] with `tightening up' [in  politics]." More often than not, while augmenting political  control, the CPC would lift excessive restrictions over the  economy on a wide scale; and it was comparatively rare for the  CPC to adopt a policy of "simultaneous tightening up" in  politics and economics. Even in the wake of the "4 June"  crackdown in 1989, they implemented the policy of "promoting  `being soft' with `tightening up'" for approximately three  years; however, the pace of economic reform in 1992 was greater  than any time in the past.  <H5>  Traditional Political Structure Can Hardly Conform to </H5> Economic Reform    As of today, the CPC top echelon believe that a basic  experience in the success of China's reform is to promote it and  development in the way of "politically tightening up, with  relaxation in the economy." However, whether or not such  practice of giving up political restructuring while augmenting  political control will continue to be effective has increasingly  become a question.    First, the existing political structure in China and its  operational form can hardly resolve and remove the political  perplexity and contractions that have arisen in recent years.  For example, regarding incidents of workers from state-owned  enterprises petitioning for failure to receive their wages,  there are few political means for the authorities to resolve  worker resentment. At last, they could only resort to relying on  financial allotments to "extend concern" in dealing with such  problems.    Second, the existing political structure in China can hardly  overcome the phenomenon of corruption. The phenomenon of  corruption, basically characterized by bartering power for  money, has spread and expanded. Consequently, the effectiveness  of the market economy allocating goods and equipment has been  seriously jeopardized; in addition, the impartiality and  authority of the party in office, and its governing in social  and economic administration are seriously injured. According to  a mainland statistics, the annual loss in state-owned assets was  approximately 100 million yuan, and a major channel for the loss  was precisely through bartering power for money, a universal  malpractice existing in various economic activities. "The first  responsible persons" of party and government departments at  various levels have considerable power in their hands to  intervene in economic life; a mere note or order they wrote  would give the green light to the sale of assets worth thousands  and even a hundred million yuan for which the officials  themselves would obtain huge sum of "commissions" in return.  The "double-track system" has cultivated a number of  bureaucrats who live on "bartering power for money," who hold an  entirely opposing and resistant attitude regarding such  political requirements as separation of party and government, of  government and enterprise, of government administration and  assets management, and democratic supervision, sharing power,  and balance in power, which fall in line with the law governing  the market economy; they are even opposed to the central  authorities retrieving the power in their hands. These people  and this social strata have shaped into a strong political force  impeding reform in China. The CPC top echelon's worries about  failure to effectively overcome such tendencies as "disobedience  to government orders," "localism," and "each going his own way"  are attributed to the resistance of the aforementioned political  force.    An important task in China's economic reform is to  require governments at various levels to implement separation of  government and enterprises with regards to state-owned  enterprises, and for government departments to accelerate  conversion of functions. However, this task is very difficult  to fulfill, and one of the causes lies in the unwillingness of  those officials who have fattened their purses by utilizing  "bartering power for money" under the "double-track system" to  give up power. The phenomenon of corruption finds its root in  the "double-track system." Nevertheless, the merger of the  "double-track system" with the market economic structure can  hardly be fulfilled by relying on economic restructuring alone.    The CPC top echelon's aim in pushing reform this year is "to  push forward reform as a whole [zheng ti tui jin 2419 7555 2236  6651,] make major breakthroughs [zhong dian tu po 6850 7820 4499  4275,] shape a whole range in coordination [pei tao xie tiao  6792 1152 0588 6148.]" Such an aim for reform can hardly be  implemented in practice for lack of a design and arrangements in  political restructuring. Presently, the CPC top echelon has  increasingly resorted to administrative means to implement the  reform plan and to resolve pressing issues existing in economic  life. There is no signs of conversion of the "double-track"  situation, but a strengthening momentum of the trend to resort  to administrative means. The government's role in economic life  seems to be far stronger than the market's role; however, its  effective role is markedly reduced. From one angle, such a  phenomenon shows that China's political restructuring is behind  schedule, which has brought increasingly marked negative effects  on economic reform.  <H5>  The Authorities Confront a Dilemma in Inflation </H5>   We should say that political restructuring being behind  schedule is a great hindrance to unfolding comprehensive  economic restructuring in China; another great obstacle to  pushing economic reform will be the CPC top echelon's dilemma in  confronting inflation. What accounts for the inflation in China  today is largely the following causes: 1) Price hikes  inevitably resulting from the transition from a planned to a  market economy. This includes conversion from incomplete to  complete cost accounting, from welfare to operational service  undertakings, from "implicit" to explicit government financial  subsidies. 2) Price hikes resulting from China lifting control  over prices for grains, energy resources, raw materials,  transportations and tertiary industries which accounted for  about 60 percent of the rise in the general price level in  China. 3) Price hikes resulting from investment expansion and  excessive money. The increase of banknotes in circulation in  China exceeded 30 percent in 1993 and over 1992, and the lasting  effects of this continue to be felt this year. 4) The tax  reform plan presented this year, especially value-added tax, has  helped push up prices. Of the aforementioned four major causes,  1), 2), and 4) will continue to have a comparatively strong  impact on price rises. Perhaps there is little positive meaning  to controling price rises of goods in those categories; on the  contrary, it would result in still greater confusion in economic  life. Thus, the CPC top echelon has focused work regarding  control over prices on checking the scope of capital  construction and controling the excessive money supply, while  resorting to a series of administrative means such as listing  scores of commodities under supervision and examination,  suspending trade in coal and steel futures, and strictly  controlling circulation funds and loans while adopting such  measures as putting a ceiling on and freezing prices and  conducting price checks on a wide scale.    Despite such steps being effective to certain degree, the  negative effects resulting from them were comparatively great.  First, the losses of state-owned enterprises which rely on  voluminous low interest-rate loans for their survival continued  to grow, with chained debts rising to 700 billion yuan. Second,  unemployment pressure has continued to grow, especially a large  number of workers of large state-owned enterprise are worrying  about their livelihood because production has been suspended or  semi- suspended, with very strong resentments fermenting. And  third, the trends of governments in various places drifting away  from the central authorities has further aggravated. The  central austerity policy and taxation and banking reform  measures presented have not brought localities any substantial  benefits and power; consequently, localities paid less attention  to repeated central orders and injunctions, while utilizing  various fund-collecting channels to enlarge reproduction in  pursuit of growth rate.  <H5>  Experts Have Controversial Opinions on Curbing Inflation </H5>   Under such circumstances, great disputes have surfaced among  economists who provide the CPC top echelon with strategic  advice. A number of economists, with Li Yining as  representative, believe that only by maintaining a 9-10 percent  economic growth rate will it be possible to fully mobilize  existing resources, while avoiding wasting them. For this  reason, a certain degree of inflation is inevitable;  furthermore, the process of monetizing economic activities as  demanded by the building of a market economic structure will  inevitably be accompanied by a high inflation rate to a certain  degree, but will yield a system in which effective allocation of  economic resources will be realized. Thus, it is advisable to  keep the fight against inflation at a moderate level, the  implementation of the economic austerity policy should be  appropriate, and focus must be placed on converting the  managerial mechanism of state-owned enterprises and removing  chained debts, while allowing enterprises with high economic  returns to have more sufficient circulation funds and loans to  promote development, so that the pressure of unemployment might  be reduced to a minimum.    However, another set of economists, represented by Wu  Jinglian, believe that any form of inflation will only worsen  the economic situation and result in recession of the entire  economy as well as political instability. To maintain abnormal  state-owned enterprises with low economic returns by increasing  money issuance would not resolve chained debts, but only make  more funds flow into capital construction, with greater volume  of products in storage while stimulating the aggravation of  inflation. Thus, the pressing matter of the day is to maintain  the magnitude of economic austerity, strictly control money  supply and loans, promote the conversion of managerial  mechanism, bankruptcy, and transfer of abnormal state-owned  enterprises with low economic returns to curb capital  construction.    It was said that the authorities attached importance to and  appreciated the latter of the aforementioned two opinions.  However, in late April, inflation was not curbed in China, and  the authorities had to adopt the opinion of Li Yining's school  of economists to appropriately relax the magnitude of economic  austerity and change the targets of circulation fund loans to  take into consideration the demand of those enterprises with  better economic returns. However, economists indicated that the  authorities must raise loan rates again if they wanted to keep  the general scope of money supply under control while showing  consideration for the pressing needs of circulating funds for  various state-owned enterprises. However, deficits of numerous  state-owned enterprises will be increasingly aggravated, and the  rise in enterprise production costs will bring along further  price hikes. Such a dilemma has been a great headache to Zhu  Rongji.  <H5>  The CPC Is Likely To Convoke Its Fourth Plenary Session in </H5> the Near Future    During the "politically sensitive" period of April, May, and  June, any decisions made by the CPC top echelon will come under  the restriction of consideration for "stability." It is  estimated that at least after early June, the CPC top echelon's  policy will gradually be clarified, and the issues surfacing in  the course of economic reform and development will be placed on  top of the agenda. Probably, that will be one of the contents on  the agenda of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 14th Central  Committee said to be convoked around June.</p>

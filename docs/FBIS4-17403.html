			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Ivantsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 22 Apr -- Supplies of electricity from  Russia to Chechnya have not been halted. Electricity is being  supplied to Chechnya as before, an ITAR-TASS correspondent was  told today by Fedor Morozov, head of the central control room of  the Yedinaya Energosistema Rossii Russian shareholding company.  He said 50 MW of electricity is reaching Chechnya from Russia  hourly.    Russian power engineering people did not register any  alterations to these parameters today. Fedor Morozov thinks  that it is so far impossible to understand the reason behind the  recent reports that electricity supplies to Chechnya were cut  off, since at about 1100 Moscow Time the central control room's  communications with Chechnya went down and it has not been found  possible to restore them. It cannot be ruled out that several  customers may have been cut off, but a decision of this kind  could only have been made by Chechnya's local power grid.</p>

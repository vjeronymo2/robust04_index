Perez Balladares has admitted that insecurity is among the  social ills that have flooded the country, and he said it is  necessary to train the Public Force so that it can fulfill its  duty, but he dismissed the possibility of reactivating  militarism.    The PRD candidate made these statements to leaders of Conep,  a powerful economic organization    Perez has said his government plan does not foster  competition between the state and private sector, rather, he  said, it is urgent to improve Panama's labor efficiency so that  it can be competitive in light of the increased devotion to duty  perceived in other regional countries.    Perez has said that should he win the elections, improving  national security will be among his priorities. He will  "provide the country with an efficient police so that all of the  people of our isthmus will be sure of the protection of their  lives, personal integrity, reputation, and property..." He also  spoke of constructing the Panama-Colon Highway, extending the  Arraijan-La Chorrera Highway, and extending the David-Paso Canoa  Highway in Chiriqui Province.    During a question and answer period, Dr. Ernesto Perez  Balladares has said state banks should not compete with private  banks, adding that the National Savings Bank could be privatized.</p>

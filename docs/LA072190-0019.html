			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ECONOMIC SUMMIT IN HOUSTON  </P> <P> Columnist Alexander Cockburn ("Today's Terms of Confusion," Commentary, July  12) was right on when he rapped American journalists for their inability to  make world events comprehensible to the public.  </P> <P> His case in point: the practice of characterizing those in the Soviet Union who  want to go back to good old capitalism (pardon me, "the free market") as  radicals, and those who still believe in socialism (wasn't that revolutionary  yesterday?) as conservatives.  </P> <P> In the same day's paper, and for a week before that, I plowed through a  blizzard of babble about the Houston summit of the world's "seven  industrialized democracies." (Isn't that another judgmental,  self-congratulatory term?) I learned of the great triumph scored by President  George Bush in arm-twisting the allies to agree to begin phasing out  agricultural subsidies (Part A, July 12).  </P> <P> Nowhere, except in one small, unexplained chart, did I read that the United  States subsidizes agriculture, too. Or did the President sign that bill passed  by Congress ending all price supports to American farmers one night earlier  while I slept? Or better still, should we have former President Ronald Reagan  explain parity again?  </P> <P> Cockburn was wrong perhaps on one point. It's not just young people who are  turned off by all this babble. It goes a long way toward explaining why most  people are turned off and don't even bother to vote any more.  </P> <P> SAUL HALPERT  </P> <P> Van Nuys  </P></p>

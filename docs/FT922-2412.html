			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Investment managers given access to Swift but may snub system INVESTMENT managers have finally been allowed into Swift, the bank-owned international messaging system - but many say they no longer want to join. The decision to give investment managers access to the worldwide telecommunications network of Swift was taken last week, when banks voted by a majority of 95 per cent to make the change. Access to Swift will make it possible for investors to confirm details of securities transactions direct with their custodians using a standardised electronic format - potentially reducing costs and settlement errors. A public row erupted over the issue a year ago, when banks voted by a narrow margin to keep investment managers out of the network. At least three banks with considerable weight in Swift - Barclays, Chase Manhattan and Citibank - had voted against letting in investment managers last year. All three changed their stance last week. Investment managers claim that the banks kept them out of Swift before to force them to continue using individual banks' own in-house communications systems. The banks, however, counter that Swift already had too much on its plate and was not in a position to accept investment managers a year ago. In recent months, a group of international investment institutions has banded together to sponsor its own electronic trade confirmation system  - effectively making membership of Swift less necessary. The banks' change of heart is seen in some quarters as a belated attempt to encourage institutions not to develop this system. 'The decision has come too late,' said Mr David Batten of SG Warburg, which handles the settlement for Mercury Asset Management. 'They (institutions) appear to have found a cheaper way of doing it.' Many institutions regard the development of electronic trade confirmation as a more important development than linking to Swift, and so will concentrate their efforts in that direction. 'Our resources are finite. We have to decide which will give us the quicker pay-back,' said Mr Andrew Palmer, director of finance and operations at Legal &amp; General, the UK insurer. The cost of joining Swift, at BFr1.3m, is also likely to put off all but the biggest investment institutions. With communications links and message formats becoming increasingly standardised, it is becoming technically easier for investors to use a wider range of bank custodians to handle their securities transactions, or to switch between custodians more frequently. However, banks maintain that this standardisation will not undermine their competitive position. Investment managers are increasingly turning to a single global custodian.</p>

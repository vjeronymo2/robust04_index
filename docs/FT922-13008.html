			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / UK Company News: The Maxwell name lives on in satellite television THE Robert Maxwell name lives on in the satellite television business thanks to France Telecom, the French telecommunications company. Although not noticed by many people at the time, France Cables &amp; Radio, a subsidiary of France Telecom, two months ago bought out Maxwell Communication Corporation's 50 per cent stake in Maxwell Satellite Communications. The London-based company was set up to compete in the market for everything from professional services for broadcasters to business television and data transmission. Following its creator's death the company's name has been telescoped to Maxat - in what looked like an attempt to disguise its origins. 'My son is called Max. That's another reason for keeping the name,' said Mr Julian Costley, managing director of Maxat, hopefully. Maxat yesterday became the first outside company to move into the spare space at the new London headquarters of Independent Television News. The company has installed what it calls central London's first teleport - two steerable six metre transmit and receive antennas and associated equipment. 'We are offering broadcast and business television users London's most accessible and advanced uplink facilities,' Mr Costley said.</p>

			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COLISEUM DANGLES THE BOTTOM LINE FOR DAVIS  </P> <P> Los Angeles Coliseum Commission President Richard Riordan and two officials of  Spectacor Management Group, the Coliseum's private managers, have told Al  Davis, owner of the Los Angeles Raiders, that he could make far more money from  a reconstructed Coliseum than he could if he moved the team to Oakland or  Sacramento.  </P> <P> Meeting last week with Davis amid reports circulated by Raiders sources that  Davis may announce a move north as early as next week, Riordan said Davis was  told that sales of 180 new luxury boxes and 10,000 club seats in a new Coliseum  to corporate and other buyers for up to $50 million would in effect match the  franchise fees that Oakland and Sacramento interests have offered.  </P> <P> Riordan said Davis had indicated he would like to hear more details. Davis did  not return a telephone call seeking comment. However, various Raiders sources,  asking not to be identified, have said that a deal is close to being  consummated to move the team out of Los Angeles and could be announced next  Monday or Tuesday.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Sacramento sold $91.8 million in bonds Tuesday, with about half of  that reserved to pay the Raiders the $50 million fee it has offered.  </P></p>

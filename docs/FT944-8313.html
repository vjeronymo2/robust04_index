			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / This Week: Big clubs push the panic button - Sport It has, observes Terry Butcher, been like August 12 - with soccer managers gunned down rather than grouse. From his new role as a hotelier in the Scottish hills, where they know how to shoot, Butcher, former England captain and sometime league manager, has observed the slaughter. Mike Walker at Everton, Ossie Ardiles of Spurs, Ron Atkinson from Aston Villa. 'Look at Atkinson. Won the Coca-Cola Cup last season. Took the team into Europe and now he's fired after a few bad results,' says Butcher, himself tin-tacked from Sunderland before embarking on a new life as mine host at the Old Manor Hotel, Bridge of Allen. 'There isn't a manager in England who isn't worried about next week.' So what's new? In terms of job security, the British soccer manager and the Colosseum gladiator would have had much in common. 'It's always been precarious,' agrees John Camkin, secretary of the League Managers' Association (LMA). 'But without a doubt we're seeing something completely new here, to have big-name sackings in such numbers.' Panic is the new factor. According to Camkin, and virtually everyone else in the game, the financial gap between the Premiership and Division One is now so great that club chairmen are terrified of dropping down and never being seen again. This season, four clubs will be relegated to a soccer netherworld, where Sky TV's money doesn't reach and Manchester United never visit. 'It's straight down into the polar regions, in terms of crowds, money and resources. It's an unbelievable difference,' says Butcher. For a club with high fixed overheads, staying among the elite is not just about a place in the sun. It's about survival. 'If you were to drop out of the Premiership, a lot of revenue streams turn down simultaneously,' says Steven Kind, chief accountant at Leicester City (themselves currently in the worry zone). 'As well as smaller gates, you'd have to look at the ticket pricing structure. In Division One, where we were last season, it would be a struggle to keep the same number of season ticket-holders. You'd have to re-assess the whole running of City.' A 'Foxes' season ticket currently costs Pounds 340, 30 per cent higher than last year, when they were in the lower division. Sky TV revenues will form around 13 per cent of the club's expected Pounds 6m-plus turnover this season, whereas Division One is covered by ITV, which pays nothing like as much. Official statistics for English league soccer as a whole show an average Premiership gate this season of 23,375. For Endsleigh Division One the comparable figure is 10,567. Probably the biggest fixed cost for a club is the players' wages bill. In the old First Division, two seasons ago, the weekly average wage was Pounds 1,152. Now the Premiership estimates a figure of Pounds 2,500, and that conceals some startling variations. Jurgen Klinsmann at Spurs is said to be the highest-paid player in British soccer, earning Pounds 12,000 a week. If the club goes down, the wage bill doesn't. 'In any normal business, personnel are not a fixed overhead. But in soccer, because of transfer values, they are, and also a capital asset,' says John Camkin, once a director of Coventry City. 'Until, that is, you stop paying them, whereupon they become valueless to the club because they can go where they please without earning a transfer fee for you.' Clubs are not run by idiots - even if it sometimes seems that way. Most have attempted to create income that doesn't rely solely on match results. Manchester United now earn more from merchandising than from playing soccer. Even Leicester have sold an incredible 25,000 copies of their new team shirt at Pounds 35 a go. 'You daren't rely on what happens on the pitch every Saturday afternoon. You're running a business, not just a soccer game,' says Steve Kind. It may be felt that relegation and the subsequent struggle for upward redemption are part of soccer's appeal to the lifelong fan. After all, there is hardly a club that hasn't fallen from grace and had to struggle long and hard to regain its rightful status. Teams built from effort and reward have always been more popular with British supporters than the side full of bought-in stars. However, what seems to be emerging now is the real possibility that the Premiership and Division One, although notional neighbours, will have the same relationship as Savoy Hotel guests to the vagrant sleeping rough in the kitchen doorway - occupying the same patch but hardly interchangeable. 'It will become more difficult for a non-Premier club, trading on its own resources, to find the players to take it up - or back up - to the top level,' predicts Steve Coppell, chairman of the LMA. 'There won't be any more Wimbledons. It isn't going to happen.' This fact hasn't been lost on the Division One clubs themselves. Although two will be promoted next May, it will be a hollow victory if their standards and finances are so below par that they become immediate casualties after one season in the Premier League. All season there has been a swirl of rumour that Division One is about to break away from the Football League and ally itself with the elite as 'Son of Premier League'. Privately, the Premier League admits the pressure from below, but says it is doing nothing to foment revolution. 'The bigger Division One clubs need crowds, glamour and excitement, and they want out of the League as soon as possible,' says Camkin of the LMA. The other crucial change in the footballing scene has been the arrival of multi-millionaire 'owners' on the model of US sport - men like Jack Walker at Blackburn, Peter Johnson at Everton, Sir John Hall at Newcastle and Jack Hayward at Wolves. Their near-limitless willingness to spend is able to create a business large enough to operate in the big time of the Premiership. 'Small-town clubs with big ambitions don't want to be out scouting for new strikers. They should be looking for a billionaire,' says Coppell. 'In the future, no one is going to take an ordinary run-of-the-mill football club to the very top level without massive independent financial worth.'</p>

Sladyslaw Klaczynski, the director  of the MSZ press department, explained that Poland did not  condemn the transgression of human rights in China since it is  difficult to conscientiously judge the situation by virtue of  the distance between our countries. Director Jan Woroniecki of  the UN department [of the MSZ] informed us that the MSZ had  instructed the Human Rights Commission's Polish delegate to  abstain from voting after consultations with the government.    In turn, Justice Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz stated  that  the stance of the MSZ on this matter is not the stance of the  government, but merely an internal instruction of the MSZ, one  with which he is not familiar. The Democratic Union and the  Liberal Democratic Congress have expressed indignation on  account of the nongranting by Poland of support for the UN  resolution on the transgression of human rights in China. Union  of Labor Deputy Aleksander Malachowski said that this decision  is an example of the victory of trade and economic interests  over a feeling of responsibility for adherence to elementary  civil rights.    Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the special delegate of the UN Human  Rights Commission in the former Yugoslavia, said that the  sacrifice of higher criteria, as he termed the protection of  human rights, for other political criteria threatens the state  with a loss of respect in the world. On the other hand, in the  view of Krzysztof Krol of the Confederation for Independent  Poland, the decision of the Polish Government on the issue of  the voting was correct and witnesses to the independence of  Polish foreign policy.</p>

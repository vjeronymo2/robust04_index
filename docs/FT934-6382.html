			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Trade talks The passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement set the stage for successful completion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations. Unfortunately, events since then demonstrate how difficult it will be to finish this play. With only three weeks left before the December 15 deadline, difficult issues need to be resolved right now. Not only is this not happening, but the US is even introducing new problems at this very late stage in the negotiations. In his statement to the Trade Negotiations Committee in Geneva last week, Mr Peter Sutherland, the Gatt's director-general, was even moderately optimistic. Eighty-three participants have made offers on market access; the principle of comprehensive 'tariffication' of non-tariff barriers has been generally accepted; 85 participants have made initial offers on services; and new revised texts on the multilateral trade organisation and dispute settlement have also been produced. Unhappily, there remains a host of unresolved old issues, to which new ones have been added. Under market access, for example, Mr Sutherland lists agriculture, textiles and clothing, tariff harmonisation, electronics, and leather products and footwear. Proposals to eliminate tariffs on steel products also remain critical if balance is to be achieved in the market access package. Meanwhile, the US has outraged other participants by introducing a proposal to permit discriminatory taxation of foreign providers of financial services. It is also planning to dump on these negotiations at this late date new proposals aimed at making the scandalously protectionist anti-dumping policy still more so. Equally disturbing is the agreement by Mr Clinton to seek a 15-year phasing out of the multi-fibre arrangement, as part of the price paid for Nafta. No wonder an exasperated Mr Sutherland stated that 'now is the time for heads of delegation to put solutions rather than problems on the table'. Those solutions have to come from the negotiations between the US and the EC, the two chief actors. They must soon reach the agreements that will provide the basis for the final global package. Unfortunately, this week's discussions between Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, and Sir Leon Brittan, the EC's chief negotiator, seem to have done more to clarify their disagreements than resolve them. Next week's discussions in Brussels must achieve far more. To mollify the French, for example, the two sides will need to agree an 'interpretation' of the Blair House accord on farm trade as effective as the 'clarification' of the Danish position under the Maastricht treaty. Similarly, they will have to agree the outlines of a comprehensive market access agreement. Next week's meeting offers almost their last chance. They are obliged to succeed. They have no acceptable alternative.</p>

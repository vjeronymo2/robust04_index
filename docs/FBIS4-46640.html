			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by NARODNA ARMIYA special correspondent </F> Lieutenant-Colonel Nykyfor Lysytsya: "Those Who Flew Augmented  Their Experience"]    [Text] The weather decided to arrange the first test for  the fliers on the day of the flight proficiency performance  evaluation in the fighter air regiment commanded by Colonel  Bohdan Spodarko. The black clouds crawled across Carpathia and  immediately covered the ground with heavy rain and powerful  lightning. The meteorologists, of course, would not give the  go-ahead to the missile-bearing aircraft under such conditions.  The pilots can take up the aircraft in a combat situation, and  even in peacetime, under extraordinary conditions, since they  are fighters. All-weather fighters. The likelihood that one of  the fiery bolts that were tearing from the clouds could hit an  aircraft, however, was quite large. The flight operations  officer and the commander of the 14th Air Army,  Lieutenant-General Viktor Lyashenko, who headed the commission  to summarize the results of the performance evaluation, decided  not to risk it. The start of the flight shift was moved from  1500 to a later time, which forced certain corrections to be  made in the flight schedule. This had no better effect on the  mood of the aerial warriors. It is well known that a pilot  begins his flight while still on the ground, readying himself  psychologically and performing these or those operations in his  mind, reflecting on each minute of the flight. And now the start  was being pushed back, until who knows when, for what period of  time, or whether it would go at all.    The engines of the MiG-29s roared to life at 2000 hours.  Regimental commander Colonel Bohdan Spodarko took off. Behind  him, in the rear cockpit, was the commander of the division,  Colonel Ivan Ivanchuk, who performed the role of instructor  during this flight. The commanders, as usual, were the first  into the sky.    Reports soon started coming in from the aircraft to the  command post--the headings of the route to the training area and  some of the zones themselves, according to the data on the  meteorological conditions, could be used for making the flights.    The aircraft called Hosha in the regiment was the next to  taxi out to the runway. Whence the name? I would point out,  before answering that question, that there is also a Kesha here.  Those names were taken from an animated film, and the pilots  called the aircraft that for their particular coloration, which  reminds some of a parrot.    We have already noted in our newspaper that two MiG-29  aircraft had made demonstration flights to the United States and  Canada more than two years ago. They were painted over at that  time accordingly. The missile aircraft returned to their  Fatherland after the completion of the air show. They were once  more in the order of battle, they were making planned flights,  and it is worthwhile to point out that it is considered quite  prestigious in the regiment to take up the Hosha or the Kesha.  Many interesting elements can be discerned in this story. First  of all, the fact that the pilots have never lost their sense of  humor, even during the harshest of testing. One also senses that  they love their aircraft, so they even give them names. The main  thing is that our Air Forces are getting their own history,  their own traditions. Possibly these two aircraft, which were  the first to announce to the Canadians and the inhabitants of  the United States the existence of the state of Ukraine and its  armed forces, will someday take their place of honor in some  museum.    Major Serhiy Dorofeyev once had occasion to make a flight on  the Hosha. It is worth noting that he performed the exercises in  piloting technique quite successfully, and made a takeoff and  landing. During subsequent flights that were made before  nightfall, as well as at night, all of the pilots demonstrated  good aerial proficiency. Squadron commander Yuriy Protsenko  received outstanding ratings in aerial navigation and for the  interception of airborne targets. His colleague, Major Volodymyr  Veherynskyy, also made a weapons-delivery flight in excellent  fashion. Regimental Navigator Major Mykola Romanov received the  highest grade for piloting technique and for the interception of  airborne targets. Senior pilot Captain Serhiy Doroshenko and  other aerial warriors also "brought home" a high rating to the  airfield. The officers displayed considerable combat  proficiency, flight experience and diligence. All of them are  pilots of the highest qualifications, have been on combat alert  duty to protect the airspace of our nation dozens of times, and  strove to show themselves in the best light in the evaluation.    But do high results obtained in control flights testify to a  high status of flight proficiency and combat training among all  of the pilots in the fighter regiment? It would be a  considerable exaggeration to say so. It should be noted that  there were disruptions in the operation of aircraft hardware  during the flight shift as well. The transmitter was not working  for a certain time, for example, during the second flight on the  aircraft of the regimental commander. The experienced pilot, of  course, was able to get out of that non-standard situation  successfully. There were also other problems that were not very  substantial.    The main argument that was not in favor of the fliers,  however, was the fact that the plan for combat readiness was not  entirely fulfilled in the regiment. Fourteen flight shifts were  carried out in all, on which the pilots spent just 240 hours in  the air. Why so little? That almost sounds like a rhetorical  question. But the fact that the air units have a miserly  quantity of fuels and lubricants has been discussed repeatedly  in the pages of our newspaper. No aircraft can go up without  aviation fuel. The motor vehicles that support the flights  cannot leave the motor pool without gasoline and diesel fuel.  The sharp reduction in the number of pilot sorties also tells on  the level of readiness of these aerial fighters. A considerable  portion of them have already lost their professional  skills--more than half of the pilots in this regiment.  Lieutenant-General Viktor Lyashenko emphasized when summarizing  the results of the evaluation. The pilots should either be  flying or they have to be let go to the four winds--this quite  categorical conclusion of the commander has solid grounding. A  pilot who has not taken an aircraft up for more than a year,  after all, cannot now even be called a pilot, since he needs to  learn again almost from square one. And this should not be taken  as an insult, but rather as reality; such is the specific nature  of the profession of the pilot. He can lead the life of a  vagabond if he does not have his own apartment, he can agree to  a reduction in his ration of flights or his material supply, but  he cannot fail to fly. The principal conclusion that could be  drawn, after the performance evaluation conducted in this and  other flight units, can be phrased roughly as follows: the most  important problem, which requires immediate resolution, is the  provision of fuels and lubricants. There will be true aerial  warriors--not just a handful of them, but the overwhelming  majority who hold flight positions today--when there is fuel.</p>

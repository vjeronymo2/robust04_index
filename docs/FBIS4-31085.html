			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Vaclav Havel by Robert Tamchyna in </F> Prague on 3 June; from the weekly "Conversations at Lany"  program -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Tamchyna] Today I naturally have to open our  interview with a question about a visit to the Czech Republic by  Chilean General Augusto Pinochet. Our leading politicians have  dissociated themselves from his visit. However, I have to admit  that I perceive their repeated assurances that they have nothing  to do with his visit as proof of their embarrassment and an  attempt to shake off a certain share of responsibility.    [Havel] I do not think I am trying to shake off any share of  responsibility. I am not the one who issues visas; I have not  issued a visa for him. I have simply learned from newspapers  that Mr. Pinochet is here.    He is not a man to my liking. He is simply the man who  organized a putsch against a democratically elected government.  On one hand, his name is linked to an economic miracle, but he  is also linked to much cruelty and rages by secret police. This  man is not to my liking. I have simply acknowledged that he has  made a visit here, as on occasions a number of people I do not  like will probably do. [passage omitted]    In this context I would like to say one more thing. I am an  essentially nonideological or anti-ideological person. I do not  think people should be assessed according to on which side of  the barricade they are said to be standing. It has always made  me angry to hear Communists saying that Stalin stood on the  right side of the barricade, that he fought for a better world,  and that he just made some small mistakes. It is the same when  somebody says nowadays that Mr. Pinochet stood on the right side  of the barricade and that he just made some small mistakes in  the form of murdering and persecuting people. This is an  ideological vision of the world that can, step by step, totally  detach itself from the basic humanistic assessment of actions,  from the basic respect for a state ruled by the law.

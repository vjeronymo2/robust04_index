			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Markets: Traders indulge in a little trick or treating - Wall Street THE AIR on Wall Street was thick with political rumours this week as stock market traders indulged in a bit of early Hallowe'en 'trick or treating'. They included rumours that President Bush had overtaken Governor Clinton in the polls (he had not, but the gap had narrowed), that more damaging evidence about Clinton's subversive anti-war activities in the 1960s would be released (it was not), and that new, nastier revelations about the Democratic candidate's past love-life were being prepared by the tabloids (they were not, at least, not up to yesterday). Stock markets are always vulnerable to political speculation during an election campaign, never more so than in the final few days. This year's election, however, has been particularly difficult for investors to call. Apart from an especially fickle electorate, much of the blame for this lies with Ross Perot. The Texan billionaire's influence on the race has been almost impossible to track. His ratings rise after each debate appearance and every 'teacher-knows-best' television commercial, only to fall sharply after every paranoid complaint about armed attacks on his house, computer-doctored photographs and Republican dirty tricks. The markets are not worried that Perot will win, but they are worried about the uncertainty his up-and-down candidacy brings to the race. Having gradually become accustomed to the prospect of a President Clinton - and even come to rather like the idea - equity investors are having to grapple with the thought that a last-minute desertion of Perot supporters to the Republican camp could let President Bush in through the back door. This might explain why the stock markets did not greet the reports on Wednesday and Thursday that Bush was rallying in the polls with much enthusiasm. In normal circumstances, a sharp improvement in an incumbent Republican president's standing in the polls would be a cause for celebration. But this is not a normal year. A Clinton victory was almost fully priced into stocks about two weeks ago, and the market was poised to celebrate a Democratic win. Bush's revival has threatened to upset those carefully laid plans. The pharmaceutical stocks that institutions sold, on expectations that a President Clinton would introduce drug price controls, may have to be bought back. Construction, heavy equipment and transportation stocks, bought in hopes of big increases in the country's infrastructure spending, may have to be sold. Judging by the erratic performance of stocks in the latter half of the week, some investors were doing just that, frantically shuffling their assets in a final attempt to position their portfolios for the big day. The markets were not helped by the confusing array of economic statistics released by this week. Ironically, the most politically-sensitive number - the 2.7 per cent rise in third quarter gross domestic product - produced the most subdued reaction. While the President seized on the GDP report as evidence that the economy was turning around, investors barely blinked. Few trusted the figures to be accurate because GDP data is often substantially revised. Philip Braverman, chief economist of DKB Securities in New York, and the king of the Wall Street bears, may have summed it up best when he sneeringly labelled the report 'pre-election statistical racketeering.' The measure of the country's output may have looked good for the economy, but most the week's other figures painted a bleaker picture. Consumer confidence was down again, as were new home sales, durable goods orders and manufacturing activity in the industrial Midwest, while jobless claims were up. The week's quarterly corporate earnings reports were also less than promising. Chief among the disappointments were was car makers. General Motors' Dollars 752.9m loss in the third quarter may have been slightly smaller than expected, but turmoil in GM's top management - chairman Robert Stempel was ousted on Monday and other managing directors are expected to go soon - point to an uncertain future for the country's biggest manufacturing company. Ford may have a more stable management, but like GM it is suffering from a serious decline in its European markets, which contributed to the Dollars 158.9m loss the company reported for the third quarter. The extent of Ford's problems in Europe - where all the big economies are in trouble - surprised the market, and led to a sharp downward revision in Wall Street's estimates of fourth quarter earnings. As one analyst put it: 'It wasn't the size of the loss. It was how they lost it.' Monday    3244.11 + 36.47 Tuesday   3235.73 -  8.38 Wednesday 3251.40 + 15.67 Thursday  3246.27 -  5.13 Friday    3226.28 - 19.99</p>

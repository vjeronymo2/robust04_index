			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / UK Company News: T&amp;N raises Pounds 37m for purchase T&amp;N, the motor component manufacturer, yesterday successfully placed 21.9m shares at 170p to raise Pounds 37m to help finance the acquisition of Goetze AG, the German piston ring producer. The deal, announced in principle last year, will cost DM250m (Pounds 102m). The first DM90m instalment was made yesterday, the second DM90m is due next March with a final DM70m due in March 1995. T&amp;N's share price rose 7p to 184p yesterday amid enthusiasm for the deal among institutional investors. Mr Colin Hope, chairman and chief executive, said he was not too concerned that the German economy appeared to be heading more rapidly into recession than was anticipated last December. 'We envisaged significant cost reductions and restructuring so our forward projections were based on a lower volume than business was operating on historically,' he said. The group was assuming that the German economy would be improving by 1995. It thought German car production would fall 15 per cent this year. It appears to be 20 per cent down. Goetze, which is privately owned, is the largest producer in Europe of piston rings for supply to vehicle makers as original equipment. It also produces gaskets and has an important manufacturing presence in the US. It has six plants in Germany and five in the US, as well as others in France and Turkey. Mr Hope said the group had been hoping to do a vendor placing but tax problems and complexities arising from the family shareholdings made this difficult. The placing means T&amp;N will be restricted from making further placings for a year. T&amp;N said yesterday that Goetze would have significant strategic benefits for the group and would strengthen its position as a supplier of components to original equipment manufacturers.</p>

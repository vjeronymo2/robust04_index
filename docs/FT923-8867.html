			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / How To Spend It: Mega-yachts sink in a sea of recession - Keith Wheatley discovers that the super-rich are finding it hard to dispose of their floating gin palaces ONCE they were known, scornfully and with a touch of envy, as gin palaces. The mega-yachts of the super-rich were at their most visible each August moored to the cobbled quay in San Tropez or filling a sheltered anchorage on the Sardinia coast. But recession has left many of them lined up in Mediterranean harbours, as empty as the office blocks which financed them. The industry is unanimous that there has never been a better time to buy a mega-yacht. As over-borrowed tycoons find the bank manager no longer returning calls, the corporate toys go on the block. Bargains - although the pin-striped brokers of this industry would never use such a word - abound. One such was the late Robert Maxwell's vessel Lady Ghislaine, from which he fell to his death last November. It was sold this week for a price thought to be around Pounds 10m - considerably below the original asking figure. But there is always the slightly larger My Gail III, owned by Gerald Ronson of the stricken Heron Corporation; he is asking Pounds 14m. Will he get it? The yacht brokers of Antibes and Monaco shiver. They know full well that Natalina B, the 162 ft flagship of Harry Goodman's International Leisure Company, is still for sale at Pounds 8.5m with scarcely a nibble to date. Southern Cross, once Alan Bond's pride and joy, sits forlornly alongside a quay in Antibes while its former owner works on a prison farm in Western Australia. Nigel Burgess, who runs an eponymous company with offices in Monaco and London, is the most successful broker and manager of mega-yachts - defined as being over 110 ft long and worth more than Pounds 10m. 'At prices over Pounds 10m, you seldom deal with inherited wealth,' he says. 'It's almost always self-made business money, and the yacht is a corporate vehicle. That means it is terribly vulnerable to the general state of the economy.' With his heavy tortoiseshell spectacles, perfect manners and cautious speech, Burgess could be a Harley Street physician or a royal courtier. Discretion is a way of life with these men. They may work the Monte Carlo waterfront but they go to work in worsted suits and black lace-up shoes. 'Owners are paranoid about secrecy, largely because they don't want to reveal the extent of their lifestyles to their employees or business competitors,' says Alex Braden of Yachting Partners International, a rival to Burgess. There is also an unspoken superstition that the better-known a yacht and its owner becomes, the more likely it is that the two will be parted - the Lady Ghislaine and the Trump Princess, once owned by Donald Trump, being just two of the more conspicuous examples. The Trump Princess used to be called the Nabila after the daughter of its owner, Middle Eastern 'fixer' Adnan Kashoggi, who hit the financial rocks in 1985. Property developer Trump then offered around Pounds 30m for the vessel, at that time the world's biggest and most luxurious. After the sale was agreed, the distaff side of the Kashoggi family pointed out the dishonour of another man owning a yacht named after Nabila. Adnan's people called Donald's people. Meanwhile, Burgess was swimming in this rich soup at 10 per cent commission. Trump recalled: 'They asked if, out of respect for Kashoggi, I would take his daughter's name off the boat.' He mulled it over and agreed - if Kashoggi dropped the price Pounds 1m. 'I think it was just a hell of a good deal,' added Trump who, later in the '80s, met his own financial nemesis. The yacht now is owned by Saudi prince Talal Ibn Abdul Aziz and is having a Pounds 35m refit in Germany. Insider gossip says it is for sale again. Maxwell actually bought the Lady Ghislaine second-hand from Ronson (although, in this rarified milieu, 'existing yacht' is the tactful phrase employed to describe something not quite fresh from the builder's slipway). It is the third-largest yacht registered in Britain after the royal yacht Britannia and Ronson's present runabout. The publishing tycoon immediately re-named the Dutch-built vessel after his favourite daughter. The boat was always available for charter at Pounds 100,000 a week in high season. In contrast, says Burgess, the privacy-conscious Ronson was one of the few owners who declined to charter his yacht, although it was used a great deal for corporate entertaining. With annual running costs for this type of vessel at around Pounds 1.5m  - a good skipper alone can command a Pounds 150,000 salary - chartering makes makes commercial sense. Inland Revenue officials are much more willing to allow a yacht as tax-deductible if it has been chartered. But will the affluent vacationers who pay Pounds 52,500 a week this summer to charter Deneb Star C know they are on a boat owned by rock star David Bowie? You will not find a single photo of the rock star on his private floating palace. London charter consultant Jan Spivey says those wanting to charter regard it as a big plus if they can rent the yacht of a global celebrity. 'Unfortunately, ' she adds, 'most of the people with an attractive image want total discretion. So you can't exploit it to market the boat.' Lady Ghislaine was the exception. 'Maxwell's ego made sure it was the most expensive boat in the Med, so it didn't do a great deal of work. Plus, he was hideously difficult to deal with.' Nevertheless, some found it worth persevering, Frank Sinatra among them. Yet, when it comes to selling a boat, the high profile of the owner can be a distinct drawback, especially if he has gone bust. 'That kind of publicity will put people off, however good the yacht is,' says Burgess. Braden agrees. 'Guys who are in a conservative way of business don't particularly want to buy the toys of people who took too many risks and failed - or who may now be in prison. Some of the vessels currently for sale attract flash characters who haven't really got the money. They just like to say they looked over so-and-so's yacht. Serious players don't really want to know in a duress sale.' At the other end of the scale - serious money, made quietly - there is scarcely a ripple in the yachting pond. Brave Goose, the 152 ft mega-yacht of British tycoon Sir Donald Gosling, continues to be booked months ahead at Pounds 156,000 a week. Very few customers will know or care that Royal Navy veteran Gosling made his fortune with a UK company, National Car Parks. They crave a main saloon (with baby grand piano) that, says the brochure, 'is a piece of England, like an embassy.' With its midnight-blue hull and white upperworks, red ensign fluttering at the stern, Brave Goose is testimony to traditional values, sober accounting, and directors who keep their hands off soaring office blocks and out of the pension fund. Meanwhile, who will buy My Gail III or Natalina B? International yacht consultant Eric Ogden looked out over Antibes harbour and sighed. 'They're lined up like tombstones,' he said. 'The boats are like a Who's Who of business problems.'</p>

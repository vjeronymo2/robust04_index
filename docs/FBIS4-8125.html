			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Sarajevo, April 9 (AFP) -- Ceasefire talks  between Bosnian and Bosnian Serb military leaders at Sarajevo  airport broke down Saturday afternoon minutes after getting  under way, the UN said.    Bosnian general Rasim Delic and Bosnian Serb general Ratko  Mladic will now have a 48-hour cooling off period during which  they will both hold consultations with political authorities,  said United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) commander in  Bosnia, General Michael Rose.    The meeting was called to reach an agreement on a ceasefire  for the eastern Bosnian Moslem enclave of Gorazde, where the  Serbs launched a major offensive two weeks ago, and on ways of  securing a global solution to the Bosnia crisis.    But Delic insisted on a "short-term arrangement" for Gorazde  while the Bosnian Serbs were seeking an overall ceasefire,  UNPROFOR spokesman Captain Eric Chaperon said. [passage omitted]    Despite the breakdown, the UNPROFOR spokesman said Rose  remained confident an agreement would eventually be signed.  [passage omitted]</p>

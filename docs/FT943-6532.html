			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / This Week: Television The oldest profession in the world makes use of modern mass media to make its point. An Open Space Special shown at a post-post watershed hour (Tuesday 11.15-11.55, BBC2) is given over to John Bratherton, 26, a Cambridge philosophy graduate who has made a career decision to go into prostitution. The programme begins in shadow, with Bratherton's identity disguised, but within seconds he's had enough. And that is the point he is trying to make: that the clandestine, murky view of his world is not entirely accurate and he wants to balance that picture by appearing on television. We see Bratherton, punting down the Cam, and there is even an interview with the other kind of punter - a married man with a family. It's a brave film to make not least because the Inland Revenue might be watching. The latest and most dreaded management buzzword - 'upward appraisal' - is analysed in The Business (Thursday, 7.30-8.00, BBC2). The theory is that if employees turn the tables on their bosses and anatomise their performance it will lead to better performance all round. Federal Express has been using it for over a decade and is zealous about its efficacy - a bad report can affect a manager's pay, bonuses and long-term survival. WH Smith and BP are at the early stages of introducing it and the cameras snoop on a denunciation session where a BP manager is subjected to a critique by his colleagues. The programme claims that upward appraisal is a powerful weapon for those with a grudge against the boss and that in many companies managers are feeling like marked men. Alas there are no interviews with any of them. A marked man who is very much in evidence is Colin Firth in a new series of The Ruth Rendell Mystery (Friday 9.00-10.00, ITV), which begins with Master of the Moor in which Firth is Stephen Walby, the chief suspect in a murder hunt. As a child, Stephen dreams that he comes across a corpse on the moors, and then another, and another. To his horror, his dreams come true and the police believe that he is the man responsible. Although not as engaging as the Wexford series, all of which have now been filmed and transmitted, this will not disappoint Rendell fans. For those for whom only Wexford will do, the good news is that Rendell is writing another and plans to film it are already in progress. Firth's first major TV appearance was in Tumbledown, the Charles Wood play about a Falkland veteran which created vast controversy. Now Wood has come up with another play about soldiers, A Breed of Heroes (Sunday 9.30-11.00, BBC1), which begins a new season of Screen One. Adapted from the novel by Alan Judd, the piece, set in Belfast in 1971, is a comedy drama in which our hero, played by Samuel West, has to take over from the battalion press officer who has shot himself in the foot - literally. The actors were given several weeks army training, with the officers separated from the other ranks - and it shows. Alkarim Jivani TV editor of Time Out</p>

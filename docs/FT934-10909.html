			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Steady Eddie at the bank MR EDDIE George, appointed this summer as governor of the Bank of England, is working hard at his reputation. The new governor has assiduously cultivated an image as an inflation-hater. But words alone will not persuade the financial markets to forget the fact that his tenure as the Bank's deputy governor coincided with one of Britain's two most destabilising inflationary booms since the second world war. Not that Mr George was personally responsible for the policy errors of the late 1980s. But the scars clearly run deep, as does his determination not to see the same inflationary mistakes repeated. Hence his warning, at the end of last week, that a further cut in interest rates might not be compatible with the government's target of keeping underlying inflation below 4 per cent a year. Now that the UK has a golden opportunity to lock into low inflationary growth, he is not going to see the opportunity thrown away. Curiously, the same defensive caution does not shine through the pages of the Bank of England's latest inflation report. The Bank has clearly gained in stature over the past year, while the quality of its quarterly inflation report has boosted its analytical reputation in comparison with the Treasury's monthly monetary report. But the Bank's report does not, at least at first sight, appear to constitute the brief from which Mr George was reading last week. If the government was considering a further cut in interest rates to coincide with the Budget, it will find little in the report to deter it. The inflationary outlook, the report suggests, looks promising. Labour market pressures are subdued, inflationary expectations have eased substantially since the early summer, monetary growth is consistent with the government's inflation objectives and there is room for several quarters of above-trend growth before the economy will show any signs of overheating. 'There is a slight possibility that in the first half of next year inflation will rise above the top of its target range,' the report acknowledges, citing the end of summer price discounting, the effects of increases in indirect taxes and the impact of the switch from the community charge to the council tax. But, 'excluding those taxes, inflation is expected to start falling in early 1994, and could reach a level close to the middle of the target range in 1995'. The Bank's analysis highlights two risks: first, that the government will not take sufficient action to reassure bond markets by closing the fiscal deficit; and, second, that tax rises to close the deficit will prompt wage-bargainers to seek compensation and thus feed inflationary expectations. Reassuring the financial markets on the deficit is chancellor Clarke's territory. Further fiscal tightening is almost certainly necessary, and the chancellor would be wise, both economically and politically, not to delay the medicine. But if he is considering a cut in interest rates to ensure that the recovery is not aborted in the process, then, with the necessary caveats about being prepared to react to future inflationary pressure, the report effectively gives him a green light. Presumably Mr George agrees with the Bank's analysis. So his statement last week demands a more subtle interpretation. The governor is surely correct that a cut in interest rates, without a substantial fiscal tightening, would be a grievous error. But a cut in interest rates, balanced by tax increases and combined with a commitment to raise rates if wage inflation starts to pick up, would not jeopardise Mr George's anti-inflationary objectives. It is this option that Mr Clarke should take.</p>

			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / Anxiously awaiting a duty-free-for-all: Tobacco and alcohol retailers' fears about the single market BRITAIN's drink and tobacco retailers fear that the creation of the European single market next month will start a cross-Channel shopping boom that will wreak severe damage on their businesses. Although duty-free allowances will remain in force, limits on the amounts of beer, wine, spirits and cigarettes travellers can bring back from Continental hypermarkets for personal consumption will be abolished on January 1. Lower duties and taxes levied on the goods in France and other EC countries are expected to tempt growing numbers of UK shoppers across the Channel. Mr Peter Lewis, director of the Wines and Spirits Association, says: 'We are very apprehensive. Some small traders may be forced out of business before the government realises it is losing an unacceptable amount of revenue.' The threat of large-scale commercial smuggling as Customs formalities are withdrawn from Channel ports is particularly worrying to retailers in southern England. Even under the present restrictions on personal duty-paid imports - 1.5 litres of spirits, 50 litres of beer, and five litres of wine - it is estimated that liquor purchases abroad total Pounds 350m a year. That is equivalent to the annual drinks sales of Co-operative Retail Services. Beer brought into the country by returning holidaymakers already accounts for 5 per cent of the UK's take-home beer market. Next year, each adult will be allowed to bring in up to 10 litres of spirits, 90 litres of wine, 110 litres of beer, 200 cigars and 800 cigarettes for personal use. But these are merely 'indicative levels' to help Customs and Excise distinguish between genuinely private imports and commercial trade. The onus will be on anyone bringing above those amounts into the country to prove that they are for personal use - but a family wedding, say, would be an acceptable reason for exceeding the levels. The changes will offer cross-Channel shoppers some tempting bargains in spite of the recent sterling devaluation. A couple bringing back their full liquor allowance would save Pounds 350 in tax after paying for the ferry crossing and a good meal in Boulogne, according to the Brewers' Society. Some comparisons of retail prices suggest possibly much higher savings. A half litre of Stella Artois lager is 60p cheaper in France than in the UK and a bottle of Morgon Beaujolais is little more than half the UK price. A packet of 20 cigarettes costs Pounds 1 less. Nobody, of course, knows how British consumers will react to the opportunity. Customs officials, pointing out that a quarter of the 25m cross-Channel trippers a year return with less than their duty-free allowances, predict a brief initial rush of bargain hunters, then a return to more normal levels of traffic. Relatively few travellers, they believe, will have the money to buy in bulk or the space in their cars and caravans for more than a fraction of the allowance. P&amp;O Ferries, preoccupied with taking over Customs' task of policing duty-free purchases aboard its vessels next year, tends to agree. It does not expect its ferries to be swamped with shoppers. The Treasury, which last year collected more than Pounds 11bn in duty on liquor and tobacco, forecasts losses of about Pounds 250m in excise revenue from cross-Channel buying next year. The brewing and tobacco industries predict that the loss of revenue will be considerably higher. The Brewers' Society calculates that Pounds 100m will be lost on beer imports alone. The Tobacco Advisory Council says UK cigarette sales might fall by 6bn, resulting in a revenue loss of Pounds 400m. One Scottish bus company is said to be taking bookings for cross-Channel trips on which each coach will be accompanied by a lorry to carry the passengers' goods home. Nor do events on other borders between high-tax and low-tax countries lend support to a sanguine view of prospects. Denmark's consumers buy 13 per cent of their beer across the border in Germany. Canadian customers account for 25 per cent of the turnover of US drinks retailers along the border between those two countries. Mr Bill Simpson, of Whitbread's corporate planning staff, says: 'We are very concerned about the possible effect of extensive cross-Channel shopping. The beer allowance is roughly equal to the average annual consumption per head in the UK - and five times the average amount a consumer drinks at home.' Mr David Coxon, trading director of the retail chain Victoria Wine, says the increased allowances 'clearly represent another form of competition for beer, wine and spirits retailers'. Denmark had started to cut its taxes to narrow the differential with Germany, but the UK government had rejected calls to peg or cut duty.</p>

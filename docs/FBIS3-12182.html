			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi </F> Beilin by Me'ir Einstein; place not given -- live]    [Text] [Einstein] Were you surprised by the Arab decision  to suspend the talks?    [Beilin] It is hard to say that I was surprised but this is  definitely a worrisome development which should not be  disregarded. I think that the next step should be the United  States getting into the thick of things in order to prevent any  exacerbation that could ultimately present all the parties with  a situation they may not have initially wanted. Such a  development may, God forbid, preclude the continuation of the  talks.    [Einstein] You speak of deeper U.S. involvement in the  talks. Perhaps from our point of view this may lead to greater  pressure on Israel?    [Beilin] No, definitely not. We are not worried about U.S.  pressure on Israel. There is a high level of coordination  between the United States and Israel. We know that the U.S.  Administration is highly interested in promoting the peace  process. On no account would the United States want the  situation to deteriorate. Now, after this terrible act, Israel  would have a hard time directly persuading the Syrians and  Lebanese to return to the talks. We are also having a hard time  with the PLO in this respect. I believe that right now the  Americans could be helpful in this.    [Einstein] Deputy Foreign Minister Beilin, should Israel  perhaps be more forthcoming toward the PLO, or were yesterday's  cabinet decisions sufficient?    [Beilin] I believe that the decisions made yesterday  constitute a precedent. Such decisions have never been taken  before.    [Einstein] But nevertheless?    [Beilin] I do not see any room for additional decisions with  regard to what happened in Hebron and the ramifications of that  terrible deed. Israel can now tell the world that it has done  all it could, and I very much hope that it will now be easier to  resume the political process despite all the natural and  understandable difficulties.    [Einstein] Thank you, Deputy Foreign Minister Beilin.</p>

			<p><P> January 9, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: PLACENTIA;  </P> <P> MERCHANTS GROUP HONORED BY CITY  </P> <P> Calling local merchants "the spirit of La Placita," Mayor Norman Z. Eckenrode  presented the Placentia Downtown Merchants Assn. with the fifth annual Golden  Achievement Award for work in the Placita Santa Fe area of the city.  </P> <P> "We have a great advantage over other cities because we have (an) old town  (area)," Eckenrode said.  </P> <P> "And we're going to make it even better."  </P> <P> The award, given yearly to a group or person instrumental in helping the city  achieve its redevelopment goals, was presented to Raul Davis, Dennis Blake and  Ray Craite.  </P> <P> "My family has lived in the area for over 120 years," said Davis, owner of  T'quepaque Restaurant. "I'm proud to have a business there."  </P> <P> The Placita Santa Fe area, one of the oldest in the city, is located south of  Chapman Avenue and east of the Orange Freeway.  </P> <P> Although some local residents were reluctant to accept the idea of  redevelopment on Main, Santa Fe and surrounding streets, the Downtown Merchants  Assn. worked closely with residents to "really make things happen," said Joyce  Rosenthal, director of development services.

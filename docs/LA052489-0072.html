			<p><P> May 24, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BOY KILLS FRIEND, 13, IN RUSSIAN ROULETTE  </P> <P> A 14-year-old boy shot a 13-year-old friend to death in a game of Russian  roulette Tuesday in Valencia, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department  reported.  </P> <P> Gabriel Soto, 13, of Newhall, died instantly when he was hit by a single round  from a large-caliber handgun, Sheriff's Sgt. Birl Adams said. The gun belonged  to the 14-year-old's father, Adams said.  </P> <P> The boy, whose identity was not revealed because of his age, was taken to  Sylmar Juvenile Hall and held on suspicion of murder.  </P> <P> "They were playing a version of Russian roulette," said Deputy Val Mosley. "The  difference was, they were pointing the loaded gun at each other instead of at  themselves, and the 13-year-old happened to be the unlucky one."  </P> <P> The boys were in the living room of an apartment where the 14-year-old lives  with his parents when the shooting occurred at about 12:30 p.m., Adams said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BREA-OLINDA STREAKS PAST ALEMANY INTO GIRLS' 3-AA FINAL  </P> <P> At Brea-Olinda High, where the girls' basketball team counts its winning streak  in the 50s these days, the question isn't whether the Lady Cats will win but by  how much.  </P> <P> Brea-Olinda, the top seeded-team in the Southern Section 3-AA Division  playoffs, has yet to face a tough challenge in the postseason. And Saturday  night was no exception.  </P> <P> Brea-Olinda's victim this time was Alemany, winner of its previous 12 games.  But when it was over, the Lady Cats were the ones with their winning streak --  now at 51 games -- still intact after a 72-43 victory at Esperanza High.  </P> <P> In doing so, Brea-Olinda, the 1989 3-A and state champion, advanced to the  final, where it will meet Palos Verdes, a 62-48 winner over Estancia.  </P> <P> "We're happy to be going back (to the title game)," Brea Coach Mark Trakh said.  "We're real happy."  </P> <P> You'd be happy, too, if your team was 29-0. The Lady Cats won their last 22  games last season, giving them the second-longest winning streak in Southern  Section history.  </P> <P> Riverside Poly holds the record with 84 consecutive wins.  </P> <P> Aimee McDaniel scored 22 points to lead the way Saturday. Jody Anton chipped in  with 13 points and Allison Bickel had 13 points and eight rebounds.  </P> <P> But it was Bickel who had Trakh raving after the game.  </P> <P> "Allison had the game of her life," Trakh said. "She did a super job. She hit  the boards and had a great game defensively."  </P> <P> Brea-Olinda's defense forced 18 turnovers and held Alemany to 12-of-44  shooting.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Lady Cats relied on McDaniel's outside shooting (two three-point  baskets) and driving layups and the inside play of Bickel and Anton.  </P> <P> "We just kept pounding the ball inside," Trakh said.  </P> <P> And in the first half, the Lady Cats were often pounded when they went inside.  </P> <P> The second quarter turned out to be a free-throw shooting contest. Brea-Olinda  made 10 of 15 free throws in the quarter while Alemany made seven of 11.  </P> <P> The only basket scored in the final 3 minutes 27 seconds of the first half was  Bickel's layup at the buzzer.  </P> <P> The Lady Cats led, 40-22, at halftime and by as many as 32 in the second half.  </P> <P> Guard Rachel Coretti scored 22 points for Alemany (20-7).  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 13, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DOWN-TO-EARTH ARTIST GETS INSPIRATION FROM UNIVERSAL FORCES;  </P> <P> ART: LITA ALBUQUERQUE TELLS AN AUDIENCE AT THE LAGUNA ART MUSEUM WHAT'S BEHIND  HER ENVIRONMENTAL CREATIONS.  </P> <P> The constant blowing of the wind, the flat horizon and "violent eruptions of  birds singing" created the sensual backdrop for Lita Albuquerque's youth in a  Tunisian fishing village. "Nature became my companion," the artist, who now  lives in Los Angeles, told a captivated audience at the Laguna Art Museum on  Thursday morning. "I really grew up thinking about my relationship to the  environment."  </P> <P> Albuquerque initially summarized her art matter-of-factly as dealing with  "geometry, alignments (of objects), color and combination of metals with  geometry and color." But she devoted most of her talk to the ways she feels it  expresses her perceptions of major forces in the universe.  </P> <P> "I don't work for the mind," she emphasized. "I work phenomenally, perceiving  through all the senses. My intelligence is from the body, not from the mind.  When one sees (my work), one does respond through the body. Everything I do is  symbolic."  </P> <P> Albuquerque, 43, has exhibited her installations and paintings widely in the  United States and is the subject of a retrospective exhibition opening Jan. 18  at the Santa Monica Museum. An untitled painting of hers from 1985 recently was  acquired for the Laguna Art Museum by its Contemporary Collector's Council.  </P> <P> A vibrant woman whose face is framed by shaggy curtains of long dark hair, she  often couches her remarks in New Age metaphysical terms.  </P> <P> She refers to gold -- which she has used extensively in her work during the  past three years -- as "a very transformative color." Her previous use of  copper was "about the reflectivity of the planet." The full moon that waxed  during the creation of one of her works gave her "tremendous energies." And  toward the end of her "Good Morning Laguna" talk, she confided mysteriously  that she is "very involved in power spots."  </P> <P> Her color slides of site-specific work, such as "Malibu Line," frequently  elicited oohs and ahhs from her audience. In the piece, a broad path of bright  blue pigment stretching down a bluff to the ocean creates a vivid T-shaped area  of color, like a secret channel of the sea.  </P> <P> The piece is from 1978 when, after moving from Malibu to an inland Venice  studio, she had stopped making art. Something was missing. "I didn't have that  view," she said. "The horizon line wasn't there."  </P> <P> She began taking walks near the beach and photographing "the verticality of my  body in relation to the horizon." She realized that the intersection of her  body and the horizon produced a cross form. ("That's where symbols come from.")  The experience moved her to dig a trench on the bluff and fill it with blue  pigment.  </P> <P> Blue became her trademark color, evocative of "space, the universe." On a trip  to Death Valley, she decided she wanted to cover all the rocks with blue  pigment so they would "dissolve into the sky." Although friends restrained her  from attempting the project, she has made several pieces in dry lake beds that  involve the dusting of rocks or earth with color. (In response to a question  from the audience, she said she uses clay-based pigments that are not toxic.)  </P> <P> These pieces are ephemeral, of course, changing with every breath of wind. At  first, Albuquerque said she worried that the wind would ruin her images of  figures, circles and triangles. But she became intrigued with the way the  pigment interacted with the forces of nature -- or even with the intrusive  actions of motorcyclists leaving wheel tracks in the earth.  </P> <P> For "Windows Into the Earth," made for a private home, she set a triangular  patch of blue pigment on the unfinished driveway. The piece subsequently was  covered by asphalt, but Albuquerque said she considers it to be still in place  -- even if unseen -- awaiting some puzzled future archeologist.  </P> <P> Her "Washington Monument Project, The Red Pyramid," from 1980, traced the tip  of the shadow of the famous obelisk in Washington as it fell due west, north  and east by means of 80-foot-long, 8-inch-deep, V-shaped trenches of red  pigment. To the artist, the geometry created by the relationship of the Earth  revolving around the sun conveys a kind of primal energy.  </P> <P> Although she briefly acknowledged the red tape involved in that piece (it "was  right in front of the White House!"), Albuquerque didn't dwell on the logistics  of making her work, even though at the time she had to juggle everything with  the help of only one assistant. (She now has five.)  </P> <P> Clearly, she preferred to dwell on the perceptions that enrich her from  traveling -- to the Yucatan, to Egypt, or even to Sedona, Ariz. There, she  said, a mere three days of drinking in the sensory qualities of the landscape  gave her ideas for two years of work.  </P></p>

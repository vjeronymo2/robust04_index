			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> MACHINISTS VOW TO FIGHT IF UNITED WORKERS' BID OKD  </P> <P> In the strongest language it has used so far, United Airlines machinists union  Thursday urged the board of United's parent firm, UAL Corp., to reject a  $6.75-billion labor-management buyout.  </P> <P> Louis R. Schroeder, president of District 141 of the International Assn. of  Machinists, said in a letter to UAL's board that the $300-a-share proposal  "jeopardizes the livelihoods of the work force and the long-term viability of  the carrier."  </P> <P> United's management has tried to persuade the machinists to join the bid, which  is also backed by United's pilots union and by British Airways. Financing for  the proposal was reviewed by UAL's 13 outside directors Thursday.  </P> <P> The labor-management proposal would give employees a 75% stake in the airline.  Management, including Chairman Stephen M. Wolf, would get 10%, and British  Airways would get a 15% stake.  </P> <P> United's flight attendants said Thursday that they have reviewed the proposal  and might participate. But the machinists, United's largest labor group, have  opposed the buyout as unnecessary and too expensive.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Legal Challenge Possible  </P> <P> The machinists have said UAL is worth no more than $240 a share, and have  questioned the airline's ability to survive a debt-financed transaction. UAL  stock, which has soared in recent weeks as a result of takeover and buyout  talk, closed Thursday at $280.50, down $2.75, in New York Stock Exchange  trading.  </P> <P> Schroeder, who represents 23,000 mechanics and other United ground employees,  said that if the board approves the bid, the machinists will have "no  alternative other than to take all actions available to aggressively protect  our members against its negative implications."  </P> <P> The machinists could mount a legal challenge to block the transaction, or they  could strike after their contract becomes amendable next month. Financial  sources said the possibility of a job action might make lenders think twice  about financing a buyout without the machinists' support.  </P> <P> The union has also talked to Texas billionaire Robert M. Bass and has said he  is interested in a possible bid for the airline. He is believed to own about 2%  of UAL's shares.  </P> <P> Besides the labor-management bid, UAL has also received a $275-a-share offer  from Los Angeles billionaire Marvin Davis. Davis indicated that he is not yet  prepared to revise his bid because his staff is still reviewing confidential  financial documents obtained from the airline this week. He had said he might  consider a higher bid if warranted by the confidential information.  </P> <P> The labor-management proposal would reportedly be financed with $4 billion  loaned by a consortium of banks led by Citibank and Chase Manhattan. The banks  would additionally lend $1.3 billion to an employee stock ownership plan, which  would own 75% of the airline's stock.  </P> <P> In addition, British Airways would contribute $750 million in return for  preferred stock, and the pilots' union would contribute $200 million from its  pension fund. It would also receive preferred stock in return. Management was  reported to be planning a contribution of $500 million.  </P> <P> The pilots have also said they would contribute another $250 million in wage  concessions and increased productivity, but the machinists contend that the  figure is inflated. For example, $40 million of the pilot contribution is not  cash, but is said to be credit for wages lost during a 1987 strike. The  machinists do not think that lost wages should count as equity.  </P></p>

The young people of the fishing  sector, representing the nation's different provinces, held the  sector discussion in Cienfuegos Province.    Such important topics as achieving greater efficiency and  productivity, taking better care of the work force, increasing  the movement of innovators and efficiency experts, and  confronting criminal actions took up the greatest part of the  session. During their speeches, the delegates pointed out the  way Cuba's young people are at the center of the nation's  problems and discussed the initiatives they are undertaking.    [Begin unidentified speaker recording] I don't need to tell  you that there has been a tremendous deterioration in the work  force because of this crime problem. In the past three years, we  have lost approximately 1,000 people, because of all these  things -- as many captains [patrones] as crew [lancheros] and  baiters [encarnadores]. I mean, it is really quite serious. And  we who need the support of the comrades from the [word  indistinct] of the ministry and the comrades who are involved  with these things... [pauses] We have followed up with the  comrades from the UJC's national bureau and the provincial UJC  bureau to try to recruit 80 young people to the center. The UJC  immediately moved forward on the task. We have the 80 youths for  the center, but well, a bit... [pauses] the entry of these new  young people into the center has, as we say in proper Cuban,  stalled [se ha trabado]. [end recording]    Also analyzed at this fishing sector discussion was the  progress of fish farming in the country -- the possibilities  that exist with a reservoir capacity of 9 million cubic meters  of water in Cuba, in addition to all the infrastructure that has  been created to produce fry. Nevertheless, there is still quite  a way to go before some 40,000 tons of fish a year can be  produced to supply the population. The main difficulties lie in  the lack of a work force, and its instability.    The plenum resolved to create a new generation of fishermen  as was done in the first years of the Revolution. The residents  of Cienfuegos expressed their experience in this task, and  fundamentally in developing family fish farming.</p>

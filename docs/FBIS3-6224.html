The agricultural committee of the House of Councillors,  which  is scheduled to convene Wednesday, is also expected to set a  date to discuss consumers' worries about the rice supply in a  plenary session of the upper house.    Legislators from the opposition Liberal Democratic Party  (LDP), had urged the committee meetings after customers started  to line up in front of supermarkets hoping to buy some scarce  unblended Japanese rice.    In a controversial decision, the Food Agency announced on  March 7 that it would mandate the blending of Japanese and Thai  rice for retail as an emergency measure to discourage consumers  from hoarding domestic rice.    In a field excursion to supermarkets and rice retailers in  central Tokyo, a group of 11 LDP legislators from both houses of  parliament interviewed shoppers about the situation on Tuesday.    The group also visited the metropolitan rice center, where  imported rice is being packed, and observed the quarantine  inspection of Australian rice shipments at the Yokohama customs  office.    The legislators also plan to inspect government storehouses  and other facilities related to rice distribution on Thursday  and Friday and on two days next week, in preparation for the  special Diet meetings, they said.</p>

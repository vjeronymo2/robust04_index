			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / International Company News: Manpower declines to Dollars 18,000 after tax MANPOWER, the employment group which eventually resulted from the merger of the UK's Blue Arrow group and Manpower of the US, yesterday reported a steep decline in first-quarter profits. Blaming the general recessionary climate on both sides of the Atlantic, the Milwaukee-based group made Dollars 18,000 after tax in the first three months, excluding any goodwill amortisation. This compared with an Dollars 8.69m profit in the same period a year earlier. Revenues in the period amounted to Dollars 681.3m, against Dollars 669.3m. The company had already warned that, after a fairly sharp earnings tumble in 1990, it would break even or even possibly show a small loss in the first quarter. It did not provide a detailed break-down of the figures, but said that the Manpower International subsidiary contributed profits of Dollars 7.96m, against Dollars 23.4m last time. Mr Mitchell Fromstein, chairman, noted that the first quarter is usually light in terms of revenues and profits, and claimed that revenues had held up relatively well, at least preserving the group's market share. The company is currently redomiciling to the US, from Britain. Yesterday, its shares, listed in ADR form, eased  1/8 to Dollars 12.</p>

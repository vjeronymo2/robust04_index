J. Chenier &amp; the Red Hot  Louisiana Band, Dewey Balfa &amp; Friends, Nathan &amp; the Zydeco Cha-Chas (in  their first Southland appearance), Danny Poullard &amp; the California Cajun  Orchestra, Wilfred Latour &amp; the Zydeco Goodtime Aces and Joe Simien &amp;  His Country Boys.  </P> <P> Sunday's bill features Queen Ida, Beausoleil, Balfa, Nathan, Poullard, the  Louisiana Cajun Trio and the Crawfish Wranglers.  </P> <P> Music will run both days from noon to 7 p.m.  </P> <P> Information: (714) 638-1466.  </P></p>

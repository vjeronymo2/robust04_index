			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lt. Gen. Valentyn Samoylenko, chief of </F> communications of the Armed Forces of Ukraine: "In Full Swing.  The Signal Troops of the Armed Forces of Ukraine at Work"]    [Text] Military communications evolved in the remote past,  when the unique features of East Slavic military art began to  emerge. At that time, troops in the battlefield were led by  voice commands, the personal example of their commanders, and  signals sent by audible devices. That is how commanders passed  on orders and instructions and received reports.    However, these simple means of communication could be used  to  exercise command over troops only as long as military actions  took place on small areas of land, usually on open ground, and  commanders personally observed the battlefield.    Fundamentally new means of communication came into use in  the  wars fought in the second half of the 19th century and the  beginning of the 20th century -- the telegraph and the  telephone, the invention of which was made possible by the  important contributions of such leading scientists and inventors  as T.L. Shylling, V.S. Yakobi, V.B. Yakobi, P.M. Holubytskyy,  Ye.I. Hvozdyov, A.A. Stolpovskyy, and others.    On 25 April (7 May) 1895, an important event took place in  the history of mankind. On this day, A.S. Popov, in a paper  delivered at the session of the Physical Division of the Russian  Physico-Chemical Society, reported the discovery of a new means  of communicating -- radio. The device he created made it  possible to transmit electrical oscillations (signals) without  wires. This was a truly great discovery.    From this moment on, scientists in many countries began  working intensively on the practical application of this  wonderful phenomenon.    Radio technology [radiometody], which involves the  generation  and propagation of radio waves, also forms the basis of  radio-relay, tropospheric, and space communication lines, radio  broadcasting, television, radiometry, phototelegraphy, and many  other fields.    Radio communication uses wave frequencies that range from  hundreds of hertz to tens and more gigahertz (GHz). Very low  frequency [VLF], low frequency [LF], high frequency [HF], and  ultrahigh frequency [UHF] radio communication lines enable  control in all fields of human endeavor. Radio performs  miracles. Radio waves are reflected from meteor trails, and they  penetrate the thickness of the ocean's waves; they are used  underground and in space; they bring us information about other  bodies in the universe.    Radio communication plays a particularly important role in  the Armed Forces. Clearly, no modern war can be won without  reliable, uninterrupted communications. To lose the ability to  communicate means to lose the ability to control your forces,  and the loss of the ability to exercise command over forces  inevitably results in defeat. This fundamental principle,  established during the years of the Great Patriotic War, remains  equally important today.    Radio makes it possible to exercise command over troops and  weapons at any time of the year and at any time of day or night,  requiring no search and no superstructure [bez poshuku and bez  nadbudovy], when stationed in one place and when on the move,  over the heads of the enemy.    Modern military radio equipment makes it possible to block  the interception of information and sometimes even to prevent  the discovery that radio waves are being used.    This radio equipment has made it possible to create  fundamentally new organizational structures of mobile signal  centers at various echelons of command. These structures are  easily operated, mobile, and provide commanders and staffs with  means of communication both in place and on the move [na mistsi  i v rusi].    The role of technical training of military personnel -- of  every soldier and every commander -- has grown immeasurably in  modern times. The range of skills that a member of the signal  troops [voyin-svyazkivets] has to master has expanded  significantly. Thus an officer must have the knowledge and  skills of a well-trained service engineer. Sergeants and  privates can also be trained to perform the tasks of technicians  or mechanics. This has established the requirements in the  training of signal troops. The majority of graduates of military  signals schools, training units, and subunits are true masters  in their field, capable of operating complex modern equipment.    In the experienced hands of military signals personnel, the  means of communication make it possible for the command  [komanduvannya] to exercise uninterrupted and timely control of  forces and weapons. And the signal troops of the Armed Forces of  Ukraine have experienced hands.    The Signal Troops of the Armed Forces of Ukraine work  diligently and painstakingly to hone their professional skills.  During the winter academic term, a series of complex training  exercises involving the radio communications system were carried  out by the Signal Troops of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The  results of the exercises revealed excellent skills in operating  complex radio communications equipment by signals specialists  and the ability of officers to command subordinate subunits in  providing support in the control and command of troops.    The collectives commanded by officers V. Mystyuk, I.  Royenko,  V. Shevchyk, A. Yemets, and S. Maslov perform with special  distinction. The discipline, assiduity, and excellent knowledge  of regulation equipment [vyvirena tekhnika] exhibitied by the  personnel of these units and subunits allows them to perform  their assigned tasks quickly and with a high degree of  efficiency.    Officers V. Sanarov, S. Butuzov, V. Tabak, A. Levchenko, V.  Lysakonov, S. Dmytriyenko, and F. Kulishenko have shown  themselves to be excellent specialists and good methodists  [metodysty].    Many good things can be said about the crews [ekipazhi] led  by warrant officers Yu. Semenov, V. Rybachuk, S. Pyenkin, V.  Bryshchatyy, P. Bondar, V. Mandalyna, V. Dehtyarov, and S.  Litvynenko. Even in peacetime, the signals personnel continue to  perform their professional duties in the ranks of the UN  peacekeeping forces in the former Yugoslavia. M. Metla, V.  Kichkar, V. Kulykov, S. Kyrpychnyy, and L. Zolotoholovyy perform  their duties with distinction.    Watch duty [boyove cherhuvannya] is part of performing a  battle mission [boyove zavdannya]. The high degree of  responsibility and conscientiousness exhibited by A. Volva, M.  Chechko, M. Hrytsyuta, S. Derkach, V. Bilenkyy, Yu. Prokhorov,  I. Kulyk, Yu. Mostovyy, and V. Oliynyk have won them the respect  of their commanders and peers.    Much praise is merited by female military personnel and  employees [viyskosluzhbovtsi i sluzhbovtsi] of the Armed Forces  who serve as radio operators, telegraph operators, and telephone  operators [radysty, telehrafisty, telefonisty]. In particular,  employees [sluzhbovtsi] of the Armed Forces M. Kornet and L.  Matveyeva.    The annual reinforcement of the officer corps of the Signal  Troops with graduates of the Kiev Institute of Control and  Command and Signals [instytut upravlinnya i zvyazku] and the  Poltava Higher Military Command Signals School [vyshche viyskove  komandne uchylyshche zvyazku] also contributes to the excellent  performance of tasks designed to guarantee communications. A  great deal of effort and energy is devoted to the training of  future officers by instructors V. Starkov, V. Dudolad, and V.  Tymoshynskyy.    On the eve of the Great Victory Day over fascism, I would  like to wish veterans and young soldiers, experienced and novice  signals personnel good health, personal happiness, and continued  success in the building of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and  ensuring these forces with a high degree of combat readiness.</p>

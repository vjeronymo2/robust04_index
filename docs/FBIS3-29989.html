			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Feb. 24 (YONHAP) -- The Home Affairs  Ministry, investigating misappropriation of charity funds by  local autonomous governing bodies and central government  agencies, disclosed Thursday that more of such cases exist than  was previously known.    The Ministry said that many local autonomous governing  bodies  besides the six cities and counties in Kyonggi Province, in  which misappropriation cases had already been revealed by the  Board of Audit and Inspection (BAI), used charity funds  contributed by the public for other purposes between 1991 and  1993. The BAI announced Tuesday that heads of central government  agencies and local autonomous governing bodies had used charity  funds intended for the poor as "confidential expenses" or for  other reasons.    The Home Ministry has decided to begin a full-fledged  investigation into 46 government agencies and local autonomous  bodies in which the Board of Audit and Inspection has already  exposed scandals. The Ministry is also studying ways to expand  inspection by the BAI to include 275 local autonomous governing  bodies, citing the principle of equity. It plans to rebuke  public servants found guilty of committing irregularities and  misappropriating charity funds who are uncovered by the BAI.</p>

			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / BR sell-off plans open to change: Transport secretary stresses opportunities for amending Railways Bill MR JOHN MacGregor, transport secretary, yesterday appeared to leave the door open to significant changes in the UK government's proposals for the privatisation of British Rail. Mr MacGregor, unveiling the Railways Bill, emphasised the opportunities for parliament to amend the legislation before it won royal assent. 'The whole point of the parliamentary process of dealing with legislation is to carry out a parliamentary scrutiny,' he said. 'So there will be full parliamentary scrutiny in the months to come, and there may well be changes.' The plans for British Rail are threatening to turn into the most controversial privatisation yet. They have been criticised by a range of bodies including consumer groups, the public transport lobby, professional institutions, trade unions and MPs. The aim is to split British Rail into two, with one body operating the trains and the other owning the tracks. Freight operations would be sold and the passenger train operations would be contracted out to the private sector in up to 40 separate franchises, starting in 1994. Mr MacGregor has already climbed down on one aspect of the proposals, saying that franchisees will not necessarily have to face on-track competition from other operators trying to poach their customers. There are criticisms of the practicality of separating track ownership from the operation of trains and the possibility that track charges could price traffic off the railways and on to the roads. Yesterday, Mr Brian Wilson, a Labour transport spokesman, claimed the bill would mean fewer services, greater safety risks, more bureaucracy, higher fares, more freight on the roads and heavy job losses. 'Above all, one is struck by the Byzantine complexity of what is being proposed,' he said. 'The lawyers will love it. Fragmenting the railways means everyone registering with everyone else, and a vast web of agreements and regulatory procedures.' Sir Bob Reid, BR chairman, refused either to endorse or criticise the bill. 'It is certainly a legitimate way of broadening the financial base of the railway. Whether it works or not really depends on who comes forward and runs these franchises,' he said. Mr MacGregor said the plans would bring better railway services for passenger and freight customers and better value for money for the taxpayer. Fares would rise no more rapidly than they had under British Rail, he predicted, and closure procedures would remain as stringent as they were now. Mr MacGregor acknowledged that work was still to be done on some of the details of the plans. A document on rolling stock leasing would be issued next week, another on the track charging regime would follow next month, and a third on the sale of freight services would come in March.

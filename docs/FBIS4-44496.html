			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Analyzing Current Economic Situation"] </F>   [Text] The domestic economic situation has been abnormal  since the beginning of the year. The general economic outlook to  change for the better has not appeared. Hsueh Chi, Deputy  Director of the Council for Economic Planning and Development,  not long ago described the current economic situation as  "strange." He pointed out the following four particular  situations in the economic sphere at present.    (1) The global economy is gradually recovering, but our  exports show no momentum. Our exports during the first quarter  this year only registered a growth rate of 0.4 percent over the  same period last year. Taiwan found itself trailing others among  Asia's four little dragons. This was quite unusual.    (2) The export orders during the last quarter of 1993 posted  an annual growth rate of 4.9 percent. It can often be used to  predict the figure for the first quarter of this year. Although  it was not high, it should be much better than the 0.4 percent  rate of growth for the first quarter of 1994.    (3) The exports during the first quarter this year were at  the lowest level since the third quarter of 1990, but the  industrial production index rose 5.9 percent, which is the  highest since 1992. If there are weaker demands abroad, how can  our industrial production maintain a higher rate of growth?    (4) Our textile industry received 20 percent more export  orders in March this year. If our textile mills, a large number  of which had already moved out, can still receive more export  orders, why are other industries less competitive?    If we carefully analyze the data regarding the four  particular situations pointed out by Hsueh Chi, we will  understand the reasons.    Let us take item two as an example. The growth rate of  export  orders is greater than that of actual exports. That was not  something which only began from the first quarter of this year.  It happened two years ago. This is apparently the result of  orders being sent to Taiwan, while goods were shipped out from  the mainland.    The third item is that Taiwan is still able to maintain a  high rate of growth in industrial production, while there are  less demands abroad. If we divide the manufacturing industry  into two major categories -- the heavy industry and the light  industry, our labor-intensive export industry belongs to light  industry. The growth rate of light industry during the first  quarter this year is merely 0.7 percent. Apparently this is the  result of sluggish exports. However, the heavy industry  registered a growth rate of 8.8 percent, which were mainly  composed of products made of basic metal and nonmetallic mineral  as well as petrochemical products mainly for the domestic  market. Products of the first two categories are mainly related  to major engineering and housing projects. That means the  percentage of manufactured products for domestic consumption  increased.    As for the fourth item, we must first understand how our  textile industry is relocating its assembly lines out of Taiwan  before we study the issue of why this industry of ours may  register a high rate of growth in export orders. Most of the  assembly lines of the labor-intensive dress and clothing  industry have moved out, but only a limited number of cotton  yarn manufacturing mills which need a great deal of capital are  still in Taiwan. Most of them have improved their production  quality and become automated. The relocation of the downstream  processing industry has brought about the sustained growth in  the export of cotton yarn. For example, the export of garments  reached a peak of $4.4 billion in 1987, but dropped to $2.8  billion in 1993, suffering a decline of $1.6 billion. However,  the export of cotton yarn rose from $2.8 billion in 1987 to $7.4  billion in 1993, marking an increase of $2.8 billion and far  exceeding the decline in the garment export industry. The export  of cotton yarn during the first quarter this year was 16.3  percent higher than that of the same period last year.  Therefore, the large increase in export orders for textile  products is truly connected with the relocation of cotton mills.  However, there is no doubt that the relocation of the downstream  mills has caused the increase in exports for the upstream cotton  yarn.    The issue concerning item one that the global economy is  gradually recovering, but the fact that our exports show no  momentum merits attention. In our 25 March editorial, entitled:  "Seize the Opportunity of U.S. Economic Recovery To Create  Better Achievements," we had issued a warning and reminded our  businessmen in the textile industry of our need to increase the  exports of some of our products which are still quite  competitive in the U.S. market just like what we did about 10  years ago when the United States was recovering from its  economic recession. We had also analyzed the effects in  relocating our labor-intensive industries in the past six to  seven years. Such relocation has made the export of  labor-intensive products such as garment and shoes decline on a  large scale. However, our total volume of exports still  registered an satisfactory growth despite the world economic  slowdown. We discovered that there are two reasons for this. On  the one hand, the trade effects caused by our investments abroad  have driven up the exports of our production facilities, raw  material and semi-finished products and parts from Taiwan, while  on the other hand, businessmen in Taiwan have adjusted  themselves well by investing more in the manufacture of  technology-intensive products. Thus, in the past six years with  the exception of 1990, double-digit growth was reported in the  export of technology-intensive electronic components, computers,  communication equipment, machinery, electric motors and means of  transportation. Such growth not only makes up the decline in the  export of labor-intensive products, but also helps maintain the  appropriate growth in the total value of exports. In addition,  it also helps rapidly readjust the industrial structure.  However, during the first quarter in 1994 when the exports of  labor-intensive products continuously dropped, the rate of  growth in the export of technology-intensive products dropped to  4 percent from its usual double-digit growth in the past six  years. It only makes up the decline in the export of  labor-intensive products, but fails to maintain the growth in  the total value of exports. Why is that? We can study this issue  from two different angles:    1. From the point of view of the supply, is it possible that  lack of investments in the manufacturing industry has made the  technology-intensive products less competitive in the export  market and thus greatly lowered the growth rate?    2. If we analyze this issue from the point of view of  demand,  we find that in making investments abroad, particularly in the  mainland, Taiwan has shifted from labor-intensive to capital-  and technology-intensive manufacturing. When the factories are  completed one after another, they would be able to produce some  production facilities, parts and components and some types of  raw materials themselves without having to import them from  Taiwan. Would that cause an import-substitution effect?    If we cannot tackle this issue and make improvements in a  timely manner, it would have an extremely adverse impact on  Taiwan's current and future economic situation. If we fail to  seize this favorable opportunity at a time when the world's  economy is recovering, it is possible that Taiwan's ranking in  exports will drop from the 12th to the 13th behind Korea or even  to the 14th behind Singapore to find itself at the tail of  Asia's four little dragons. Moreover, if Taiwan fails to  maintain an adequate growth in exports, its trade may go from a  surplus to a deficit under the pressure of the GATT entry. All  this would shake our nation's strong position in handling  economic affairs and trading in the world. This issue merits the  attention of our highest authorities. They need to take  immediate action to rectify this situation.</p>

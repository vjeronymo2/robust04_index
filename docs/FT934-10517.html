			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Germans seek new meaning in European union THREE days after the inauguration of the European Union, as laid down in the Maastricht treaty, the governing parties in Germany are urgently seeking to redefine the concept. It does not mean a close-knit federation of states, nor does it mean a loose-knit confederation, according to Mr Peter Hintze, the secretary-general of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union. Those are 'old concepts'. He suggests the much vaguer idea of 'an association of states', as proposed by Germany's constitutional court in its opinion on the Maastricht treaty last month. It sounds like a terrible defeat for dedicated European federalists, including Mr Kohl. Yet it is not, says Mr Hintze. It is just a change of names. Mr Hintze's embarrassment, at a press conference yesterday to launch the party's pre-European election campaign, was obvious. He was seeking both to distance himself from, and yet show some sympathy for, the views of Mr Edmund Stoiber, prime minister of Bavaria and the most powerful political figure in the Christian Social Union, the sister party of the CDU. Mr Stoiber had declared on Monday that the concept of European federalism was dead. It was no longer party policy, in the CSU or the CDU, he said. He wanted something more like a confederation, with clear powers retained for nation states. The Bavarian premier is articulating a growing suspicion in Germany about the powers of Brussels. Mr Hintze wants to disagree, but also, just a little, to agree. 'Mr Stoiber's views are personal views, not necessarily those of his party,' he declared. 'The process of European integration is politically irreversible. Mr Hintze's prevarication stops well short of the ringing condemnation of Mr Stoiber voiced by the German foreign office. There Mr Klaus Kinkel, leader of the Free Democratic party, the other coalition partner, rules. It would be mistaken, dangerous and a strategic error to allow 'regional considerations' to dilute Germany's commitment to European union, said Mrs Ursula Seiler-Albring, Mr Kinkel's junior minister. 'The federal government will not allow itself to be led astray in its European policy by tactical, party-political and populist considerations,' she said. Campaigning for next June's European parliamentary elections has clearly just begun.</p>

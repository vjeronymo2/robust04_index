			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / UK to take 4,000 more Bosnian refugees BRITAIN has offered to shelter 4,000 more people fleeing the former Yugoslav republics, following severe criticism of UK policy towards Bosnian refugees. The announcement was timed to coincide with a meeting in London of European Community ministers responsible for immigration, defusing German calls for its EC partners to shoulder more of the refugee burden. It was also intended to take the sting out of a series of resolutions agreed at yesterday's meeting to toughen EC asylum and immigration rules. Mr Charles Wardle, Home Office minister, told the House of Commons that Britain was willing to offer accommodation for an initial period of six months to 1,000 former detainees of prison camps and their dependants, a total of about 4,000 people. Welcoming the move for Labour, Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, said it had been 'forced' on the government by the strength of feeling on the issue in Britain. He urged European leaders to keep their nerve and not to be 'stampeded' by racial tension into adopting a 'fortress Europe' policy. Last month, Britain offered at an Anglo-German summit to take 150 former detainees and their dependants. The latest, additional, offer compares with Germany's commitment to take 1,000 ex-Yugoslav detainees. Germany already has some 260,000 refugees from former Yugoslavia. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has been seeking shelter for 6,600 detainees, mainly from Bosnia, and until last Thursday had found temporary homes for 4,300 - of whom 1,000 would be in Germany, 600 in Spain and 150 in the UK. Before yesterday's meeting, Mr Eduard Lintner, parliamentary under-secretary at the German interior ministry, said Bonn was 'not very satisfied' with the response of its EC partners. Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, who chaired the meeting, said afterwards that nobody had supported German calls for refugee quotas. But he claimed the asylum rules agreed yesterday would be 'a positive counter to any tendency towards racism inside the Community'. The rules have already been attacked by a number of human rights and refugee protection organisations for allegedly breaking international law. Separately, Mr Martin Bangemann, EC internal market commissioner, was unable to persuade Britain and Denmark to agree to give up systematic controls on people at internal EC borders after January 1, 1993. The Commission is seeking a practical solution to EC members' concerns that controls at external borders will not be strong enough to justify lifting internal checks.

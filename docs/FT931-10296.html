			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Observer: Waterfront killing Tiny Rowland's affection for Africa is well documented. It looks, however, as if Dieter Bock, the mysterious German financier who is set to join Lonrho's board this week, also knows his way around the Cape. Bock is reported to be one of the key investors in a lucrative package of land which links Cape Town's enormously successful waterfront development with the city centre. Local property developers have for years been trying to unlock the potential of the old power station/Imperial Cold Storage site. However, it seems that Bock, with the help of a young entrepreneur called Neil Bernstein, has outmanoeuvred the local property establishment and now controls one of the prize property sites in Cape Town. Details of Bock's Cape property interests, like the rest of his business affairs, remain sketchy but they suggest that Tiny has spotted a businessman with the same sort of capacity as himself for doing deals. Meanwhile, don't imagine that Tiny himself has said goodbye to the African stage. There are persistent rumours in Southern Africa that he is going to continue to expand his newspaper interests by helping support a planned ANC daily newspaper.</p>

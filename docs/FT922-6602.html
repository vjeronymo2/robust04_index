			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Reforms with a grain of sense: The EC's agricultural package, brokered by Ray MacSharry, will cut output and food prices It is a done deal - despite a little local difficulty in Italy. The Italian wrangle - over illicit milk production - could put back the date of formal agreement, but almost certainly will not. Nor will it in any case, obscure the fact that the European Community has this week agreed what is by far the most radical reform of the Common Agricultural Policy since its inception 30 years ago. Around dawn yesterday morning, 50 hours into the last round of 18 months of belligerent negotiations, Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner, got critical mass for his proposals: a clear majority for the reform among farm ministers of the 12. The EC has at last got to grips with the root problems of its grotesquely profligate farm regime. The consequences are likely to be far-reaching. The EC should soon start to reduce food output to what it needs, and what it can sell abroad honestly, by competition rather than by undercutting international producers through subsidised prices. Farmers can in general look forward to more stable incomes, and consumers to cheaper food. The countryside should gradually become cleaner, as the reform erodes financial incentives for the intensive farming practised in much of Europe. It is possible that debate on the future of European farming will be something that lay people now comprehend. The point of departure is that the EC has given itself the means to slice into the food mountains for which the CAP has become infamous. Even the modified MacSharry proposals contain the sinews needed to restrain the EC's galloping overproduction of food, now running at about 24 per cent over needs, and rising. The more muscular reform Mr MacSharry had originally envisaged was sapped by the fierce outcry of the EC's farm lobbies, echoed and targeted by their agriculture ministers. But what was achieved in principle this week is still, a senior aide to the commissioner said yesterday, 'son of MacSharry, definitely'. The commitment to rein in overproduction will not, however, automatically unlock a Uruguay Round world trade liberalisation deal, blocked by the inability of the EC and US to agree on how much each side should cut farm support within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). But such a clear policy signal from the EC cannot easily be ignored by the US, and could give the Round momentum when the two sides resume talks next week. Irrespective of when a Gatt agreement finally emerges, the EC reform will, by 1996 or 1997, have virtually eliminated the export subsidies Community producers use to dump food on world markets. These subsidies are the high octane fuel of the Gatt row, and the ruinous effects of EC dumping on its industrialised and developing country competitors are the single most insidious feature of the CAP. 'It will be very difficult now for the US not to understand that it has to make some very major move in the direction of the Community,' judged Mr John Gummer, the UK's agriculture minister. Mr MacSharry put it rather more bluntly, but the EC message to Washington from this week's meeting was uniform and clear: take it or leave it. Mr MacSharry says: 'What we are involved in here is a totally different philosophy to what has existed for 30 years.' The reform cuts subsidised prices severely, moving them close to world market levels. Cereals, for example, will drop in price by 29 per cent over three years, in addition to automatic cuts to be decided this year as a levy on overproduction - the remnant of the 1988 'stabilisers' regime which failed to rein in oversupply. Farmers will get full compensation for the cuts, paid directly, rather than as now, through an inflated price guarantee. This will be paid on a per hectare basis calculated on a past average yield which is frozen, rather than on future output. This breaks the link between the support paid to farmers and the increasing amounts which price support incites them to produce. In addition, all but small farms will only get this compensation if they take 15 per cent of their land out of production. Previous reforms of the CAP, hailed as definitive at the time, failed because they did not deal with the price support mechanism, which, allied to exponential productivity growth, easily neutralised a succession of ad hoc brakes on oversupply. Furthermore, CAP support prices have historically been tailored to accommodate inefficient German agriculture, rather than being set at French levels of competitivity. Now, prices are being set near market levels. The well-known structural deficiencies of the CAP have been magnified by the EC's tendency to throw money at all problems arising from its farm regime. Untold billions have been spent on wheezes like the the 'calf milk replacement' scheme - whereby milk from the cow's udder enters the calf's mouth entrepreneurially, first having been turned into powder, then protein enriched, then back into milk and fed to the calf. The EC Council of Ministers this week, though dominated by radicalism, nevertheless resembled nothing so much as an Arab souk, with the carpet-trading ministers extracting all manner of sweetheart deals from the European Commission as the price of their support. Germany, the main stumbling block to agreement, did particularly well. It got the nod for increasing national subsidies to its farmers, and a special deal for the eastern Lander which will probably link compensation to future production. Added up, these concessions can be absorbed by a budget currently running well under its limit for this year of Ecu35.3bn. But two questions arise out of this horse-trading. Are these additions to the reform the obstacles of the future? And are the price cuts in the final compromise deep enough? None of the concessions threatens the integrity of the reform's structure. Mr MacSharry was at his most aggressive and canny through the long, night-time negotiations he insisted on conducting with ministers individually to avoid alliances against him. He knew what he was giving away. The eastern Lander, for instance, have a rich cereal-growing tradition which could bring more unwanted grains on to the market. Except, as a senior British diplomat pointed out, the incentive to do so has just been removed. The cuts are probably not deep enough, and it is likely that new reductions will be needed further down the road. Mr Brian Gardner, an expert on the CAP, draws the parallel with the Uruguay Round bringing agriculture into world trade discipline for the first time. 'As in the Gatt negotiations,' he argues, the CAP reform 'will have established the principles for further reductions.' Farmers themselves will suffer less from these cuts than they would under present arrangements, which have forced their income into secular decline. Very simply, the more money the EC has laid out in price support, the greater the overhang on the market has become, and the less farmers have earned. CAP outlays are channelled as much into warehouses as to farmers. An independent study for the Commission shows that farm income will now fall by about 3 per cent less than it would have done without reform. The effect on food prices is disputed, not least by a food processing industry wary of raising public expectations about forthcoming price cuts. Most specialists believe consumers can expect back at least a quarter of the Dollars 83.6bn subsidy paid to European farmers in 1990 - in addition to the Dollars 62.7bn they contributed towards the EC budget and national treasuries. The Commission translates this into 15 per cent to 20 per cent cuts on pork and poultry, 15 per cent cheaper beef, 7 per cent to 8 per cent reductions on butter, and about 3 per cent off bread. All this is of a piece with what should develop as a farming culture more inclined to embrace competition. When Mr Louis Mermaz of France, until last October the MacSharry plan's most adamant foe, said yesterday: 'We accept the proposal . . . we are very satisfied,' it is clear that the competition penny has dropped. France, the EC's agri-superpower accounting for nearly half Community grain exports, was in the end frightened that prices would not come down far enough, and that quotas would be used to limit production, blunting its competitive edge. The French know they can compete with the most efficient world producers, especially in the context of multilateral subsidy disarmament offered by Gatt. A successful Uruguay Round, however, has by no means been ensured by the EC's reform. The US remains reluctant to exempt for more than six years the direct compensation to farmers from the Gatt's scheduled subsidy cuts. This is even though Brussels insists that its reform mechanism will deliver more cuts than the Uruguay Round 'final act' actually requires. Gatt requires, for example, 36 per cent cuts in export subsidies over six years, whereas the EC should have all but eliminated them within half that time. Washington and Geneva have a point, in that the direct payments, although partially decoupled from production, will still go into a single farm pot, and will eventually show up in output. That is another reason why this reform is not definitive - but neither can the Gatt pretend to anything like the definitive liberalisation of farm trade. The two processes have to be harnessed together, and may well be. But the Gatt farm chapter now seems to turn on whether the US will allow the EC to average the required 24 per cent cut in the volume of subsidised exports across sectors, rather than insisting it apply to each individual product. The EC wants to be able to cut more on products like barley and skimmed milk powder, and thereby be able to export more of its most competitive or high added-value produce, like wheat and cheese. There is nothing to suggest the US will go for this. Concern for its own wheat and soya exports is one root of the whole farm subsidies imbroglio. Now that the EC is cutting its cereals and oilseed prices, Washington may have all the more reason to fear opening any sort of gap for the Community. But MacSharry's reform has established one thing pretty clearly: the ball is now in Washington's court.</p>

			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Technology: Speedier tests for infectious diseases - Worth Watching Testing for infectious diseases such as HIV can be time-consuming. A Vancouver company has developed a test which can give the results in minutes by testing saliva rather than blood. The test, developed by Saliva Diagnostic Systems (SDS), involves placing a specially developed swab in the mouth. When enough saliva has been collected the stick attached to the swab turns blue. The device is then inserted into a waiting fluid-filled tube. As the assay recognises the existence or absence of the HIV antibodies, the colour changes. SDS: US, 206 696 4800; UK, 071 415 0550.</p>

			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets: S Africa ends mixed in slow trade South African shares ended mixed after struggling for direction in a slow trading session. The failure of the bullion price to move forward also contributed to the general lack of movement, brokers commented, although firmer London and US markets lent support. The overall index added 17 to 5,471, the industrial index 12 to 6,266 and the gold index lost 6 to 2,105. Among the day's main movers Anglos improved R1.40 to R225, De Beers made R1.50 to R107 and Gencor added 15 cents to R12. Pick n Pay lost further ground as strike action hit its stores, shedding 50 cents to R12.75. Iscor added 10 cents to R3.70, Sasol continued to move ahead adding 75 cents to R25.75 and Absa 15 cents to R9.</p>

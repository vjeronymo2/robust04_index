			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Greeks to build Gazprom link A private Greek consortium has signed a protocol with Gazprom, the Russian state energy supplier, to build a Dollars 600m pipeline across Bulgaria to carry Russian oil from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean, writes Kerin Hope in Athens. The 350km pipeline between the ports of Burgas in Bulgaria and Alexandroupolis in north-eastern Greece will take three years to build and will carry 20m-40m tonnes of oil yearly, with storage facilities for about 1bn tonnes to be constructed at the two ports. The Greek consortium includes the Latsis shipping and oil refining group, the Kopelouzos construction group and Prometheus, a joint venture between Kopelouzos and Gazprom. The Bulgarian and Greek state oil companies are also expected to participate in the project. The pipeline will provide a new outlet for Russian oil, which will be sent by sea to Burgas from Novorossysk, and ensure a steady oil supply for Bulgaria. Gazprom and Prometheus are both involved in a Greek project, funded mainly by the European Union, to build a 500km pipeline to carry natural gas from the Bulgarian border to Athens.</p>

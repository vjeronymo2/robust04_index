			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / International Company News: Another trial for Bank Bumiputra  -A look at the Malaysian bank's attempts to still old ghosts DR Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister, has earned many plaudits for his government's privatisation programme. Lumbering state behemoths, like the telecommunications and electricity utilities, have been transformed into efficient, market-orientated enterprises, and the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange has grown into the biggest in south-east Asia by market capitalisation. But an exception to this privatisation success story is Bank Bumiputra, Malaysia's second-biggest financial institution, with assets of MDollars 35bn (USDollars 14bn). One of the country's largest state enterprises, it is also one of the most troubled. The bank recently announced a 73 per cent fall in net profits to MDollars 22.7m for the year to March 31 1992. Twice in the past 10 years the state has had to rescue it. Although Bank Bumiputra insists its finances are sound, another government bail-out has not been ruled out. A new management team has been appointed, while talk two years ago of a listing has been quietly forgotten. The recent appearance in a Hong Kong court of a rather frail, tired-looking 61-year-old man has re-focused attention on the bank's affairs. Mr Lorrain Osman, a Malaysian citizen and former chairman of Bumiputra Malaysia Finance (BMF), a subsidiary of Bank Bumiputra, is facing 39 fraud and corruption charges relating to USDollars 800m in loans made by BMF to the Hong Kong-based Carrian Group in the 1970s and early 1980s. The BMF/Carrian affair shook the financial fabric of Hong Kong and ranks as Malaysia's biggest banking disaster. Bank Bumiputra continues to be haunted by the events of 10 years ago. The Osman trial, when it finally occurs, will be watched with interest in Malaysia. He was arrested in London in 1985 but extradited to Hong Kong only late last year. He has insisted he was the victim of a cover-up at the highest levels of the Malaysian government. Opposition politicians in Malaysia say Bank Bumiputra, now owned by the Ministry of Finance, is still used as a cash cow by leading government figures, particularly those associated with Dr Mahathir's United Malays National Organisation (Umno), the dominant political party. Bumiputra, a Malay word meaning 'son of the soil', refers to the country's majority Malay population. Wary of the economic power of the country's minority Chinese community, the Malay-dominated government set up Bank Bumiputra in 1965 'to remedy the lack of capital among the Bumiputras . . . to encourage them to undertake new enterprises to accelerate development and increase the wealth of the country'. The main question in the BMF/Carrian affair is how a bank set up to aid the Malay community came to lend so much, so fast, to Hong Kong-based Chinese speculators. Carrian Holdings, a previously unknown group, shot to prominence with a series of multi-million dollar deals during a Hong Kong property boom of the early 1980s. Mr George Tan, Carrian's enigmatic chairman, seemed to have money to burn. BMF was one of Carrian's main backers. When the Hong Kong property bubble burst in 1982, Carrian could not pay debts of more than USDollars 1bn. Many banks were burned. So were thousands of investors. In 1983, Mr Tan was arrested on corruption charges. In 1985, a Malaysian government report said BMF executives had entered into an intricate series of deals with Mr Tan. The report hinted at high-level Malaysian official backing for some of the loans to Carrian. Warnings by the Malaysian central bank about BMF's lending policies were apparently ignored. 'There might not have been Carrian without Bumiputra Malaysia Finance,' said the report. At least one murder has been linked to the affair. In 1983, an auditor sent from Kuala Lumpur to investigate BMF was found strangled in Hong Kong. The next year, a lawyer who had dealt with various Carrian companies was found in a Hong Kong swimming pool with a concrete manhole cover tied round his neck. When Carrian collapsed, BMF had accumulated loan losses of MDollars 2.25bn. These losses were passed on to Bank Bumiputra. In 1984, Petronas, the Malaysian state oil company, was pressured into rescuing the bank by taking a 90 per cent stake for MDollars 2.5bn. In 1989, Petronas had to make another MDollars 982m cash injection after loan losses on the Malaysian property market. In early 1991, Petronas sold Bank Bumiputra to the Finance Ministry for an undisclosed sum. Bankers in Malaysia, including some who had worked with Bank Bumiputra, say it continues to be dogged by a number of shaky loans, some made many years ago. Bankers also feel that a fresh start cannot be made until the events of 10 years ago are explained. Bank Bumiputra still faces a court case in the US in which it accused of conspiring to defraud Carrian creditors and minority shareholders - a charge it denies. In this case Mr Osman, who at one stage served as an economic adviser to the Malaysian prime minister, should supply some answers to the tangled affairs of Bank Bumiputra and spark some interesting political recriminations.</p>

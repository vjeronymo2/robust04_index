			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / Howard to consult widely on water CONSERVATIONISTS and industry are to be consulted in a review by Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, of water resources and their use, writes Alison Smith. The review's origins lie in longer-term concerns expressed by - among others  -the National Rivers Authority, the statutory body which has a duty to monitor water resources. The authority and the water companies say consumption has gone up because of a rise in the population and the increased use of appliances such as dishwashers. The review will cover conservation, distribution and charging methods. A new form of charging must be devised before water rates are abolished at the end of the decade. Metering, which is favoured by industry watchdog Ofwat, would encourage conservation but ministers are conscious that it could penalise large families. Mrs Ann Taylor, Labour's environment spokesman, said the review was welcome, though belated, but warned that metering was not a straightforward solution.</p>

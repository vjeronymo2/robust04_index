			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Yeltsin frees market prices while parliament is banned BREAD PRICES in Russia are to be freed from tomorrow as one of a range of economic liberalisation measures decreed by President Boris Yeltsin. Rebel deputies opposed to economic reform are powerless to resist the changes Mr Yeltsin is pushing through following his declaration last week that parliament was dissolved pending fresh elections. The decrees cut grain subsidies, bring in huge increases in rents and common domestic services, raise the bank rate to 180 per cent a year, curb cheap credits to industry, improve conditions for foreign investors and deprive the trade unions of their main function, control over social security payments. The measures are aimed at relieving the budget of its vast burden of subsidies and passing to consumers the real costs of production and services. Bread prices are likely to rise sharply after they are freed, while rents for flats, presently low, are forecast to rise by 10 times. The moves reflect Mr Yeltsin's confidence in his ability to impose harsh reforms while remaining secure in his position. Foreign investors, whose most common complaint is the confusion between national and local laws and regulations, are to be reassured by a law laying down that only federal decrees will apply to them. The government is also acting to stem the often illegal outflow of hard currency from Russia. Mr Sergei Filatov, Mr Yeltsin's chief of staff, at a meeting with academics yesterday predicted a 'difficult period, with many hardships, for the population'. However, both he and Mr Mikhail Poltoranin, who heads the Federal Information Centre, noted that, in most opinion polls, Mr Yeltsin's popularity has grown. The stand-off with parliament seemed set to continue last night as the government issued a fresh ultimatum to the besieged deputies and paramilitary volunteers within the White House, the parliamentary building. It said that weapons must be handed over and the building cleared by next Monday or 'serious consequences' would ensue - though the use of arms was again ruled out. An earlier deadline set for yesterday morning for the handing over of arms passed without incident. General Pavel Grachev, the defence minister, was quoted by the official Tass news agency as saying that 'dangerous advisers' within the White House were pressing for terrorist attacks against Russian leaders. Interior ministry troops clashed with a few hundred supporters of parliament near the White House early yesterday evening as they pushed the demonstrators into the nearby Barrikadnaya metro station. Resistance continued in the regions, as regional leaders meeting yesterday in the Siberian city of Novosibirsk threatened to set up a Siberian republic unless the decree dissolving parliament was repealed.</p>

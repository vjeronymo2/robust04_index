			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Cherif Ouazani: "Disturbing Political </F> Vacuum"; first paragraph is EL WATAN introduction]    [Text] The absence of the parties from the national  conference was abundantly commented on by observers, but their  absence from everyday life in the real world goes unnoticed. Is  the unending need to obtain authorization from the governorate  for any meeting the reason why the political class is shrinking  to nothing more than the parties' administrative staffs?    The regime is granting itself a grace period that everyone  is  refusing to give it, and the government is remaining quiet while  Algerian society is being shaken by a deafening silence. Does  that sound bite, addressed by Youcef Khatib to the leadership of  the FLN [National Liberation Front] with the assertion that it  is afraid of the terrorists, apply to the entire political  class? We do not wish to make that class out to be more  diabolical than it is, but the question is unavoidable when one  notes the disappearance of all party activity at the  rank-and-file level--in those parties that even have a rank and  file. Party offices in the country's interior remain hopelessly  closed, and in the eyes of the citizens, the only political  debate is the bloody confrontation between the security forces  and armed groups. Some parties use the argument that it is  difficult to obtain authorization from the governorate and are  calling for an end to the state of emergency, thus minimizing  the seriousness of the security situation, while paradoxically  deploring the absence of the state. The state, besieged on all  sides, makes a pretense of being present through its police  forces, its DEC [expansion not given] agents who do what they  can with what they are given when they do not get shot like  rabbits, and officials who do not lose sight of the fact that  they are first and foremost servants of that state.    But the state is also a very quiet government in the face of  the almost exclusive presence in the field of terrorists who  exchange civilities with speculators who have never lost their  money or their sense of direction. The armed groups have not  granted the new government a grace period, but it seems to be  taking one anyway.    Zeroual has not yet met with his former colleagues for a  Council of Ministers meeting, and government activity is  shrinking steadily away.    The president of the state (certainly an incorrect  translation of chief of state, but we are still the only  republic where "chief of state" is not the same as "president of  the republic") reportedly arrives at his office early to work on  the dossiers, but it cannot be said that those dossiers are  completely unfamiliar to him, so why does he give the impression  of being mute in response to the new upsurge of feelings of  insecurity among Algerians?    Is it because he is completely absorbed in reorganizing the  office of the president's staff? Or is it the problem of  providing this government with a base of popular support? If so,  this is the time to reoccupy the terrain that seems to have been  abandoned by the political parties as well and reconquer areas  that have been left for too long in the hands of populism and  demagoguery.    Because except for the dissolved FIS [Islamic Salvation  Front], which still holds those citadels through certain mosques  that have evaded control by the "nidhara," and the FFS  [Socialist Forces Front], which maintains a quite active  internal political life by regularly sponsoring debates between  its Executive Committee and its rank and file, the rest of the  political class is active more through press communiques or  interviews than through political activity in the field.    The strength of the FLN, for example, lies less in its  mobilization capability than in the means at its disposal for  paralyzing important sectors of the economy with the aid of men  who have survived in the major decisionmaking centers despite  the earthquakes of the past.    The Islamists in HAMAS [National Society for Guidance and  Reform] and al-Nahdah are continuing to fish for members among  the FIS rank and file even though they, too, are not active in  the field.    The fact that Nahnah and Djaballah agree today in calling  for  a shortening of the transitional period, something on which they  reached agreement during the successive phases of dialogue, is  more a matter of strategy than of tactics--in other words, they  will always agree even though they follow different paths (and  voices).    The RCD [Rally for Culture and Democracy], traumatized by  the  assassination of its national secretary, Rachid Tighziri, has  sunk into painful silence.    Added to its bereavement are the intrigues surrounding the  claims to represent culture and identity that have the MCB  [Berber Cultural Movement] as their focus.    That has the disadvantage of unnecessarily stirring up a  rank  and file whose understanding of the political nuances between  two groups claiming the same acronym is diminishing steadily.    Ettahaddi [offshoot of the Socialist Vanguard Party] is  still  the first to express its stand on current events, but it appears  that the fierce attacks on that party's members by the armed  groups have caused it to return to near-underground status, thus  preventing it from engaging in open political activity.    As for the other parties, their credibility with the  media--because it cannot decently be said that they have  credibility with the public--is in proportion to the charisma of  their individual leaders.    Meanwhile, the citizen, faced with the government's silence  and the absence of the parties, will have to contend with  speculators using the only weapon at his disposal: refusal to  buy. As for his willingness to mobilize against terrorism, that  is a subject for a separate debate.</p>

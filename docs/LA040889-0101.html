			<p><P> April 8, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INTERRACIAL LOVE  </P> <P> I was enthusiastic about the new NBC soap opera "Generations" until I read a  comment by Sally Sussman, creator of the series, that she and her writing team  avoided interracial love scenes because "interracial romance has been done to  death" (Diane Haithman's March 27 article).  </P> <P> Does she feel that romance between whites "has been done to death" also?  </P> <P> In fact, there have been few interracial love affairs in films and television.  I can easily count the explicit rather than implied interracial romances,  especially those featuring blacks with non-blacks.  </P> <P> SHELBY SANKORE  </P> <P> Phillips Ranch  </P></p>

			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Letter: Rent review structure 'nonsense' economically harmful Sir, David Simpson's letter, 'Value of a tenant in US' (April 28), overlooks an essential point. Upon assignment, the new tenant must satisfy the landlord that its financial strength is adequate to meet the obligations under the lease. Why not then release the original tenant from further obligation relating to premises in which he no longer has any commercial interest? The refusal to do so is only one of many ways in which the UK property industry, by seeking to please investing institutions, harms the prospects of its wealth-generating customers and thus of the economy as a whole. Why are tenants asked to take on leases of up to 25 years when most cannot realistically plan more than five years ahead? How many businesses would have survived the recession had they been able to downsize their property requirements in a much shorter time scale? The rent review structure is a nonsense. In boom times, rents rocket as new tenants speculate on future properity and agree record rental levels. These are then imposed on other nearby tenants as evidence of the current market. Yet when market rents fall, those of existing leases cannot because of the upward-only structure of the review. The theoretical basis of review - willing landlord, willing tenant and vacant building - is exactly that. And when market rents fall, why can a tenant not chose to sub-let his building at the new rent if he is willing to fund the difference? Because the structure of his lease will prevent it in order that the value of the investment is not damaged. It is time for tenants to wield the power they hold and for major occupiers to make a stand. It is also time for a service which seeks only to represent the interests of wealth-generating tenants. For it is not only landlords who will resist the changes needed. The larger commercial property agents will not risk upsetting their land-owning clients while tenants meekly accept commercial absurdities.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ATF has approved the application from the industry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> member, pending the final outcome of the rulemaking process,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to use these two processes in a closed system to remove VA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from wine. Other persons wishing to use these two processes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in a similar fashion should submit letter applications to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ATF requesting permission to do so. If it is determined,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through this rulemaking process, that the use of reverse  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> osmosis and ion exchange in combination in a closed system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to remove VA from wine is in accordance with ``good  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commercial practice,'' this procedure will be authorized in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 27 CFR 24.248 by amending the use column of reverse osmosis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to state that it can be used to remove off flavors in wine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Once this change to the regulations is made, no further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> letter applications will be required to use these two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processes in combination in a closed system to remove VA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from wine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The footnote concerning processes which must be done on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distilled spirits plant premises, located at the end of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 27 CFR 24.248, has been revised to state that under certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limited conditions, reverse osmosis may be used on bonded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> winery premises if ethyl alcohol is only temporarily created  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within a closed system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Ultrafiltration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> An industry member has requested that the limitation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imposed on the use of ultrafiltration by 27 CFR 24.248 be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changed to allow transmembrane pressures greater than 100 pounds per square inch (psi). The industry member states  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that they need to employ transmembrane pressures of up to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximately 200 psi rather than the current maximum of 100  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> psi which is provided for in &sect;24.248. The industry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> member indicates that their laboratory tests have shown an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase in throughput of 4 to 5-fold when the pressure is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increased from 100 to 150 psi with no change in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> character of the finished wine. Without this increase in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> throughput, the industry member states that the process is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not economically viable since they can achieve the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result with other methods at a much lower cost.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The industry member states that they chose the less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than 200 psi limitation as the upper limit in order to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintain a clear distinction between ultrafiltration and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reverse osmosis in terms of pressure. The industry member  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> points out that the two processes are also differentiated by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the fact that the membranes specified for reverse osmosis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have a much smaller pore size than those used in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ultrafiltration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The industry member submitted two samples of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ultrafiltered apple wine to the ATF laboratory for analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The first sample was processed at 95 psi and the second  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sample was processed at 195 psi. The ATF laboratory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis, based on the analytical data and on an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organoleptic evaluation, showed there is no significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> difference between the samples at these different pressure ratings. As a result of this analysis, the ATF laboratory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stated that the basic character of the wine was not altered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by increasing the authorized pressure rating from 100 psi to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 195 psi.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consequently, ATF approved the industry member's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> request to be allowed to use pressures of less than 200 psi  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when conducting operations using ultrafiltration. Other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry members wishing to use ultrafiltration at higher  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pressures may submit letter applications to ATF requesting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permission to do so. ATF may require samples prior to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> giving such approval. If it is determined through the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking process that ultrafiltration using pressures of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> less than 200 psi is considered ``good commercial practice,''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> then the regulations will be changed to incorporate this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more liberal pressure limitation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> New Wine Treating Material  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Urease Enzyme  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> An industry member has requested to be allowed to use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> urease enzyme derived from  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lactobacillus fermentum <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to reduce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels of naturally occurring urea in wine to prevent the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> formation of ethyl carbamate during storage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The enzyme is derived from the nonpathogenic,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nontoxicogenic bacterium  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lactobacillus fermentum <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . It  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contains the enzyme urease (CAS Reg. No. 9002&hyph;13&hyph;5) which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilitates the hydrolysis of urea to ammonia and carbon dioxide. It is produced by a pure culture fermentation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process and by using materials that are generally recognized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as safe (GRAS) or are food additives that have been approved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for this use by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Urease enzyme from  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lactobacillus fermentum <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  was approved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for use in wine by FDA on December 21, 1992, effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> January 21, 1993. The FDA regulation cite is 21 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 184.1924, Urease Enzyme Derived From  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lactobacillus fermentum <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The manufacturer of the urease enzyme, Takeda Chemical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Industries, Ltd., has also submitted several letters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> confirming that the urease enzyme preparation is derived  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lactobacillus fermentum <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The company states that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enzyme is standardized with glucose syrup solids and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> urease activity is adjusted to 3.5 units/mg. The company  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicates that the urease enzyme meets the general and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional requirements for enzyme preparations in the ``Food  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chemicals Codex,'' 3rd edition (1981). In addition, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> urease enzyme is used in food at levels not to exceed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current good manufacturing practice as defined in 21 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 184.1924.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Takeda Chemical Industries, Ltd., states that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> composition of the urease enzyme preparation is as follows:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> Killed whole cells of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> Lactobacillus fermentum <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> : 20&hyph;35%  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Glucose Syrup Solids 65&hyph;80%  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Takeda also states that they have confirmed that due to the low usage level (10&hyph;200 ppm) and objective of usage,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition of glucose syrup solids in this case is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered ``sweetening'' of the beverage, which is prohibited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the State of California for table wine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The industry member states that urease enzyme derived  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lactobacillus fermentum <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is economically self-limiting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> due to the high cost of the material. In addition, FDA, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their approval, did not set a specific numerical limit but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rather limited its use to ``good commercial practice.'' The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry member states that if a numerical limit needs to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> set, it should be set no lower than 200 mg/L. The industry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> member also indicated that no water is required to use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> urease enzyme.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The industry member also submitted to the ATF  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> laboratory two 750-milliliter samples of wine, one before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and one after treatment, as well as a sample of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> material. Based on an analysis of the samples and an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organoleptic evaluation, the ATF laboratory concluded there  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were no significant differences between the control and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experimental wine samples. The ATF laboratory stated that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they have no objections to this enzyme preparation being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used as a wine treating material at a maximum usage rate of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 200 mg/L provided that the enzyme is filtered prior to final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> packaging of the wine as practiced in ``good commercial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practice.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

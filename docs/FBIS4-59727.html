			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Putting Emphasis on Dialogue"] </F>   [Text] The annual pilgrimage this year is to begin on May  19, and Iran flew the first batch of its some 60,000 pilgrims to  Mecca early this month.    The political atmosphere surrounding the pilgrimage for  Iranians this year is decidedly different from the one last  year. If Riyadh's attitude towards Iranian pilgrims was  friendly then, this year it is a hostile one. If the Saudis  were cooperative and accommodating last year, this year they are  trying to make sure Iranian pilgrims would be inconvenienced.    According to reports dispatched from Medina, the Saudi  police  has kept Iranian pilgrims under intense surveillance and they  are not left alone to do their religious duties even when  visiting the tombs of the members of the Prophet's household  held most dear by Iranians. The Iranian pilgrims are also  prevented from doing the secondary rituals that usually go with  Hajj within the confines of their own religious traditions. The  Saudis are imposing on Iranians their own religious  interpretation. Altogether the pilgrims are complaining that  the Saudi police is mistreating and insulting them.    The Islamic Republic's present problem with Saudi Arabia is  not limited to whether or not Riyadh should allow the Iranian  pilgrims to do their religious-political demonstration, which is  regarded as a duty. It is not even over the number of pilgrims  that should be admitted in Mecca. It goes much beyond that.    With the change of policy on Iran, Riyadh wants to register  its dissatisfaction with Tehran's conduct of regional (Mideast)  policy. Riyadh regards the various Islamic movements in some of  the Middle Eastern countries as having been instigated or  supported by Iran. It disapproves of Iran's stance toward the  Israel-PLO peace treaty as well.    As far as the Iranians' religious demonstration is  concerned,  the Saudis' refusal has been unduly inimical. Last year the  Saudis' approach towards this issue was flexible. Iranian  pilgrims were allowed to stage the rally within the premises of  their residence in Mecca. A similar and mutually accepted  arrangement can be worked out for this year as well. On the  number of Iranian pilgrims to go to Mecca, Tehran argues that  there has been a sudden unilateral change in the quota. The  earlier agreement allowed Iran to send two pilgrims per thousand  of its population. Riyadh has changed that to one now, using a  contrived argument.    Here in Iran there is this feeling that Riyadh has had a  change of mind, from one of exercising an independent policy of  its own to following the U.S. policy of trying to isolate and  put pressure on Iran.    Everything considered, the present course of exchanges  between Riyadh and Tehran is confrontational in character. And  a confrontational policy is not in the interest of either  country nor that of the Persian Gulf region as a whole either.  After having gone through two wars, and experienced their  futility and wastefulness, what the Persian Gulf region needs is  calm, understanding and cooperativeness to engage in  construction.    Unfriendly state of ties between Iran and Saudi Arabia, as  Persian Gulf's biggest two countries, causes friction and  tension that lead to the loss of human energy that should be  used on construction. They also open the way for increased  intervention by foreign powers who would be asking for an ever  growing share of the Persian Gulf countries' resources for what  little they would give.    What Riyadh and Tehran need is to engage in dialogue towards  permanent accommodation of their legitimate concerns. The  emphasis on ties between Iran and Saudi Arabia should be a  well-studied and prudent one founded on friendship and  solidarity, and not on raising fingers on each other or  zig-zagging between tension and calm.</p>

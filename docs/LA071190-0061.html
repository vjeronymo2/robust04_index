			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DELEGATES TRAVEL TO L.A.'S PAST;  </P> <P> BLACK HISTORY: NAACP CONVENTIONEERS HELP REDEDICATE THE HISTORIC DUNBAR HOTEL.  IT WAS ONCE A CULTURAL HUB.  </P> <P> Fannie Singletary of Washington, D.C., bundled her husband and four children  into the family car and traveled 3,000 miles to help plan for the future.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, however, she piled them onto a bus in Los Angeles for a 15-mile  ride into the past.  </P> <P> Singletary was one of dozens of delegates to the annual convention of the  National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People who traveled from the  high-rises of downtown to abandoned storefronts of South-Central Los Angeles  during a tour of "historical African-American Los Angeles."  </P> <P> Along the way, the visitors stopped to help rededicate the historic Dunbar  Hotel, renowned in the 1930s, '40s and '50s as the hub of Los Angeles black  culture.  </P> <P> Strengthened to meet earthquake standards and refurbished in large part with  city redevelopment funds at a cost of $4.2 million, the 62-year-old Central  Avenue hotel has been reopened as a 73-unit apartment building for low-income  elderly residents and a museum of black history.  </P> <P> In its heyday, the Dunbar Hotel was known as a West Coast mixture of the  Waldorf-Astoria and the Cotton Club.  </P> <P> For years, it was the only major hotel in the city that welcomed blacks. Every  prominent black visiting Los Angeles passed through its Art Deco lobby adorned  with arched, Spanish arcade-like windows, tiled walls and a spectacular  flagstone floor.  </P> <P> In 1928, the hotel housed delegates to the first NAACP convention to be held in  Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Later, its nightclub was the stage for many of the great black performers of  the day -- Count Basie, Lionel Hampton, Lena Horne, Ella Fitzgerald, Duke  Ellington and Nat King Cole.  </P> <P> The Dunbar's dazzle faded when Los Angeles' other hotels opened their doors to  blacks, and blacks began drifting away from Central Avenue as the city became  more integrated. By the mid-1980s, the hotel was closed and the graceful  building fell into disrepair.  </P> <P> Much of its glory has been restored, current NAACP delegates discovered  Tuesday. After traveling through the more run-down section of the Central  Avenue business district, those on the historical tour were surprised when  their bus rolled to a stop outside the Dunbar.  </P> <P> Inside, they found Mayor Tom Bradley and black civic leaders waiting to  rechristen the grand old hotel.  </P> <P> Bradley praised the work done to "breathe new life and vigor into this  magnificent hotel" and predicted that the hotel may have the same effect in  helping revive the surrounding neighborhood.  </P> <P> Bernard Johnson, a former owner of the hotel who has dreamed for nearly a  quarter of a century of establishing a black museum at the Dunbar, pledged to  convention delegates that a historical collection will be on display in a  mezzanine museum area above the lobby the next time they visit the city.  </P> <P> Those who have seen the collection, which was displayed in the hotel in the  1970s as the "Museum in Black," describe it as a thought-provoking lesson in  the way things once were. Among the artifacts are Mammy dolls, a railroad sign  reading "Colored Waiting Room," a poster for "Uncle Tom's Cabin" and a music  folder for "Remus Takes the Cake."  </P> <P> After the speeches, the visitors climbed back onto the bus to see for  themselves the way Los Angeles once was. Tour guides from the Our Authors Study  Club explained how the city has changed -- for the better and the worse.  </P> <P> The bus passed by the intersection of Central and Vernon avenues, an area that  decades ago was the thriving "downtown area" to most blacks. Today, many stores  in the area are boarded up and unemployed people loiter on the curbs.  </P> <P> The group traveled past funeral homes and an insurance company that served  blacks when white-owned businesses refused to. They passed long-established  churches that have never ceased serving the community and empty lots where  community auditoriums or cornerstone businesses once thrived. They passed the  new California Afro-American History Museum at Exposition Park.  </P> <P> In the downtown area, tour leader Genevieve Shepherd explained how black  architect Paul R. Williams helped design several Civic Center buildings. She  pointed out the Music Center, which was built with the help of a $500,000 gift  from singer Cole and where actor Robert Guillaume now has the lead role in  "Phantom of the Opera."  </P> <P> The bus traveled through Skid Row, past Union Station and Olvera Street, where  study club President Dolores Nehemiah explained that 26 black settlers were  among a handpicked group of 44 people who founded what is now Los Angeles in  1781.  </P> <P> "From now on, when I think of Los Angeles, I'll think of the people and the  history that has occurred here," said Mellondra Johnson, a Chicago delegate to  the convention. "This isn't just a place where they have earthquakes, movie  stars and gangs."  </P> <P> Added Fannie Singletary: "People can be just as proud looking at the past as  they are at looking ahead to improving the lives of all Americans."  </P> <P> New York delegate Ray Jarvis said the tour proved to him that Americans across  the land share in a similar history.  </P> <P> "Chicago was founded by blacks, too," he said. "And New York has problems with  housing and employment, just like here.  </P> <P> "We're all the same."  </P></p>

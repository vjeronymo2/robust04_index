			<p><P> July 8, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A LOST COMPANION;  </P> <P> PARROT, ELDERLY WOMAN'S PET FOR 40 YEARS, APPARENTLY STOLEN  </P> <P> To Magda V. Wilson, it was like a serenade. As dusk advanced each evening at  her Santa Monica apartment, her companion of nearly 40 years would squawk, "I  want to go to bed. You want to go to bed?"  </P> <P> But now the 80-year-old widow is without Baby, a yellow-naped Amazon parrot  known to neighbors as a ham who loved singing to children. After years of  roaming around the apartment complex greeting strangers and calling out,  "How're you? What's your name?" the two-pound, foot-long bird was apparently  stolen Saturday afternoon from a perch outside the apartment while Wilson went  to work on a rosebush.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'I Was Beside Myself'  </P> <P> When she returned moments later, Wilson saw a young man in a red jacket walking  down the sidewalk. Then she realized that her bird, which had clipped wings and  therefore could not fly, was gone.  </P> <P> "I ran out looking for him and, of course, I didn't see him and I was beside  myself," she said, fighting tears. "He was a magnificent bird. He was my  companion."  </P> <P> Wilson, who manages the apartment complex, has been distraught since Baby's  disappearance and has had difficulty eating and sleeping. "I don't know how a  person could just pick up a bird," she said. "I have been so confused about the  whole thing."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Well-Known in Area  </P> <P> Neighbors near Wilson's San Vicente Boulevard home say the parrot and his owner  were well-known throughout this quiet corner of Santa Monica. Strangers who  have seen the pair on walks together have called Wilson to donate reward money  after seeing posters advertising Baby's theft.  </P> <P> A police report filed by Wilson valued the 43-year-old bird at $1,000, but a  local pet store owner said older parrots typically sell for about $500.  </P> <P> "He seemed to be sort of a part of her. . . . He gave her a focus," said Leila  Mara, an interior designer and Wilson's tenant since 1981.  </P> <P> Wilson's friends said Baby was a performer who loved attention and could mimic  more than 100 words and animal sounds, greeting strangers with "How are you  doing? What's your name? Want to get on my hand?"  </P> <P> </P> <P> Acquired in 1950  </P> <P> The German native acquired Baby in 1950 when she ran a pet store with her  second husband in downtown Los Angeles. She adopted the bird and kept him after  her husband's death in 1971.  </P> <P> Santa Monica police report that a young man was seen in a nearby park at the  time with a bird under a red jacket. Bulletins have been sent to county  agencies, and local pet stores have been alerted to watch for anyone trying to  sell the bird. There is a reward offered, but Wilson would not specify the  amount.  </P></p>

			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Swiss plan for truckers The Swiss government will today announce its plan for preventing discrimination against EU truckers driving through the Alps. The idea is to set road usage tariffs so high that truckers put their vehicles on trains, and to set the train fares low enough that EU truckers will not be inclined to divert to already overcrowded Alpine road passes in Austria or France. According to a report in the Sonntags Zeitung, a Zurich newspaper, existing charges for all trucks transiting the Alps would be raised by about SFr400 (Pounds 200) per trip starting in 1998. These measures became necessary after the Swiss decided in a referendum last February to ban international transit truck traffic from the Alps from 2002. The decision enraged governments and truckers in France, Germany, Italy and Austria because it applied only to through traffic. Truckers on internal journeys in Switzerland or on trips to or from Switzerland could continue to drive through the Alps. The European Commission said it would not negotiate with Switzerland on any transport issues, including landing rights for Swissair, until measures were introduced to prevent discrimination against EU truckers.</p>

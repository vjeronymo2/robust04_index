The cabinet repealed  the regulations on establishment of the "Information  Coordination Council," which provided the NSP with the right to  meddle in politics.    The council was established in 1981 to discuss judging and  managing information and framing a national information policy,  but has been criticized for its frequent intervention in  politics. The council had already lost its legal grounds to  exist on Jan. 5 this year when the law on the Agency for  National Security Planning was revised.</p>

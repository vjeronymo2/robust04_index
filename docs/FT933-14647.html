			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / International Company News: Jas Capel analysts defect to US rival THE HEAD of research and at least one other analyst from the Latin American department of James Capel have resigned to join Bear Stearns, in an effort by the US brokerage to boost its coverage of emerging markets. James Capel confirmed that Geoffrey Dennis, the head of research, and another analyst have quit, and that other defections were possible. But Mark Donegan, head of emerging markets for James Capel, said: 'If they were other resignations they would be very junior.' James Capel's New York-based Latin American research team was recently ranked joint first with Baring Securities in a survey of fund managers by Institutional Investor. Mr Donegan claimed the defections would not hurt James Capel's 29 member Latin America team, saying the brokerage 'has a wealth of in-house research talent . . to fill in any gaps." Bear Stearns confirmed the hirings but declined to comment further. However,the brokerage is known to have made coverage of emerging markets a priority. It was ranked fifth in the survey of Latin American research by Institutional Investor, behind the British brokerages, and Goldman Sachs and First Boston.</p>

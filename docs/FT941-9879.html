			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Balladur treads on colleagues' toes: How presidential rivalry is affecting the policies of the right France's presidential election is still 15 months off, but is casting a lengthening shadow over Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's coalition government and its policies. Mr Balladur protests - and he may even be sincere - that he wants presidential politics left until next year so that he can govern in peace this year. But that leaves unanswered the question of whether he will challenge his RPR party's leader, Mr Jacques Chirac, for the Elysee in 1995. The growing likelihood that he will is proving divisive in the cabinet, in the RPR and in the governing parliamentary coalition - in any case too large to be very cohesive. Apart from fomenting the bickering that comes naturally to any large group of politicians, the presidential rivalry within the French right is now affecting policy in the economy and elsewhere, at home and abroad. With record unemployment so near to a presidential election, the pressures on Mr Balladur are all for a softening of fiscal policy to revive the economy, now that monetary policy is in the hands of the independent central bank. So far Mr Balladur has made no big U-turn; he still aims to reduce this year's budget deficit. But the imminence of the presidential poll is clearly increasing Mr Balladur's innate tendency to buy his way out of trouble. The farmers got FFr3bn (Pounds 343m) last year to assuage their anti-Gatt anger. The bill for caving into the Air France strikers is still not in, but the state-owned carrier is expected to record one of the largest corporate losses in French history, more than FFr 7.5bn for 1993. Last month more than 250,000 supporters of the state school system took to the streets and won an extra FFr2.5bn over five years. Using violent tactics, members of France's small, 16,000-strong fishing industry this month got FFr365m (Pounds 41.8m) in aid out of the government. Mr Balladur's repeated financial concessions to strikers have not stirred much criticism in a country where grievances, by virtue of being strongly felt, are frequently considered justified. But as an American politician once remarked, 'a billion here, a billion there and soon you're talking about real money'. In fact, Mr Balladur has some 'real money' to play with from privatisation, which brought in some FFr40bn last year and probably more this year. He is extremely lucky to have for sale assets that the Socialists so expensively nationalised a decade ago. By contrast, Mr Balladur has been criticised by his own side for being too timid in his measures to relaunch the economy. This criticism has come from Mr Raymond Barre, a maverick member of the UDF coalition partner, but also from Mr Jean-Louis Debre, the deputy secretary general of the RPR and a totally loyal Chirac lieutenant. Mr Debre said Mr Balladur 'could have done more' in his January 31 moves to boost consumption, car sales and house buying. The effect was to undermine the prime minister, who was striving for maximum psychological impact at minimum cost. Presidential manoeuvring also explains recent incidents in France's internal security and foreign policy. One of the murkiest of these was the prime minister's decision in late December to send two suspected Iranian terrorists back to Tehran instead of to Switzerland, which had asked for them to be extradited to stand trial for murder. In making this move, which raised hackles in Berne and questions elsewhere, Mr Balladur sided with his interior minister, Mr Charles Pasqua, against Mr Alain Juppe, the foreign minister, though all three are RPR men. This squares with the curious alliance of political convenience which Mr Balladur and Mr Pasqua seem to have struck up - the emollient, aloof prime minister and rough-hewn, populist interior minister complementing each other. Because he appeals to much the same constituency as Mr Chirac, Mr Pasqua appears for the moment to calculate that he would bring far more to - and have more power in - a Balladur rather than a Chirac presidency. This is also why, at a time when Mr Chirac is the only declared presidential candidate on the right, Mr Pasqua backs the introduction of a US-style primary election to choose the right's man for the Elysee in 1995. But in the process, Mr Balladur has alienated perhaps the most important man on today's French political scene - Mr Juppe, who is also secretary general of the RPR Gaullists. Mr Balladur could have used Mr Juppe's desire to get out from under Mr Chirac's shadow to his own advantage; instead, relations between prime and foreign minister have steadily coolled. They fell out first over Gatt. To guard his own back in the event of failure, Mr Juppe annoyed Mr Balladur by insisting on written instructions for anything he negotiated; Mr Balladur later got his own back by handing out fulsome praise to all French negotiators except Mr Juppe. The prime minister then aggravated the situation by trying some 'freelance diplomacy' in Saudi Arabia. In December Mr Balladur's chief aide flew out to Riyadh, without telling the local French embassy, to prepare Mr Balladur's visit there last month. That visit took place against the advice of the local ambassador. To chortling at the Quai d'Orsay, there was no mega-defence contract for Mr Balladur to sign, and the prime minister had to return empty-handed. The FFr9bn contract was only sealed last week. Mr Balladur is also seeking to enlarge the traditionally limited role of a French prime minister by trying his hand at defence as well as foreign policy; this month will see publication of a government defence white paper. This is all part of the 'cohabitation' game of treading on the constitutional preserve of Socialist President Francois Mitterrand. But treading on Mr Juppe's toes is a more dangerous ploy.</p>

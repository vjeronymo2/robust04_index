			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Departmental review of the request will consist of (1) determining if the activities are, in fact, necessary, and (2) evaluating whether the estimated cost is reasonable for the activities to be conducted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We are also proposing to make technical changes throughout 45 CFR part 212 to update references to the office's designation and the agency official's title. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Regulatory Procedures <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The Regulatory Flexibility Act (Public Law 96&hyph;354) requires the Federal Government to anticipate and reduce the impact of regulations and paperwork requirements on small entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The primary impact of this rule is on State governments. Therefore, we certify that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because it would simply require agencies to obtain advance approval from the Administration for Children and Families before incurring administrative costs in developing implementation plans for the repatriation of groups of eligible individuals. Thus, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Executive Order 12866 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Executive Order 12866 requires that regulations be reviewed to ensure that they are consistent with the priorities and principles set forth in the Executive Order. The Department determined that this rule is consistent with these priorities and principles. An assessment of the costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives (including not regulating) demonstrated that the approach taken in the regulation is the most cost-effective and least burdensome while still achieving the regulatory objectives. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Paperwork Reduction Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> This proposed amendment would require States to submit information regarding their activities and estimated costs for Departmental approval prior to the incurring of administrative expenses for planning and implementing group/emergency repatriation procedures. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) clearance under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. chapter 35) has been requested. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=2 --> (Catalogue of Federal Domestic Assistance Program No. 93.579, U.S. Repatriate Program) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> List of Subjects in 45 CFR Part 212 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Administrative cost, Repatriation, Reporting and recordkeeping Requirements, Social Security Act, U.S. Repatriate Program. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=2 --> Dated: June 23, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=2 --> Mary Jo Bane, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=2 --> Assistant Secretary for Children and Families. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=2 --> Approved: August 5, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=2 --> Donna E.

			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Advertising by banks 'wasted' BANKS and building societies are wasting millions of pounds a year on advertising, Mintel, the market research group, claims in a report published today. It says that customers are more influenced by other factors. For example, Mintel says, most people choose their bank or building society according to its location or the recommendation of a friend rather than as a result of advertising. Mintel says in a report compiled from a survey of 1,000 adults that 43 per cent of account holders base their choice of bank or building society on its proximity to their homes. Two out of five chose the same institutions as their parents, 15 per cent listened to the recommendation of a friend and only 5 per cent said they were affected by advertising or by direct mailshots. Mintel found, that people aged 15 to 19 are more likely than other age groups to be influenced by advertising, with 13 per cent admitting they were affected by advertising. However 32 per cent said they chose the same bank as their parents. The importance for the banks and building societies in catching customers when they are young is borne out by the survey, which showed that most people stayed with the institution at which they first opened an account.

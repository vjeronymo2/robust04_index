			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 24 Apr (AFP) -- The Cuban Government will  create a special department within the Foreign Ministry for  emigrants. This was announced on Saturday by Foreign Minister  Roberto Robaina to the 215 Cuban emigrants who are participating  in "The Nation and the Emigrants" conference. Robaina also  mentioned five additional decisions made by the government in an  attempt to make more flexible the relations with a large number  of emigrants, excluding the sector described as "aggressive."    However, participants at the conference who were asked to  comment on this today said that the six measures announced by  Robaina are not enough.    The decisions announced by Robaina are:    -- The creation of a special department for emigrants  within the Foreign Ministry.    -- The lowering, from five to one year, the time between  visits of emigrants who left the country "legally" and who wish  to return to visit their family.    -- The elimination of the order that during the emigrants  visit to the country they must stay in a hotel for Cubans  residing abroad.    -- Allowing a "small" group of Cuban youths who reside  abroad to attend the university in Cuba.    -- To put out a magazine for emigrants.    -- To give continuity to the contact the government  resumed with the emigrants through this conference.    It was not clear whether among the Cubans who left the  country "legally" the government is including those who left the  country for a short visit abroad and once there decided to stay.  Meanwhile, even though the required five-year term between  visits for those who left the country "legally" has been lowered  to one year, the request for a visa continues to be obligatory.    In the hallways of the Comodoro Hotel where those attending  the conference are staying, the comments on the decisions  announced was less than enthusiastic. "It is all right...for  starters," a businessman with commercial ties to Cuba said.  Another participant, who is visiting the island for the first  time since 1989, described the decisions as "a little less than  nothing." A third participant described the decisions as "candy  in the middle of a party that should have better prizes at the  end."    Attending the conference are well-known Cuban emigrants most  of whom reside in the United States and who peacefully and  "constructively" oppose the Castro government, and others who  openly support the system.    In private, several of the opposers expressed their concern  regarding an eventual "return with empty hands" to Miami and  other U.S. cities where groups of active anti-Castro emigrants  have accused them of being "traitors" because they went to Cuba.</p>

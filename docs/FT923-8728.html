			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Employers alter line on job cuts LATEST company policies on redundancies seek to preserve workforce morale and retain the most gifted employees, according to a report published today. The report from Incomes Data Services, the employment research service, examines how recent large-scale redundancies have been managed in large organisations such as Midland Bank, Royal Ordnance, and Federal Express. It says traditional methods of avoiding compulsory redundancies, such as natural wastage, have lost much of their effectiveness during the recession. Policies now, according to the report, are intended to minimise ill-feeling and to ensure that it is not the most able employees who leave. For those made redundant, numerous services are being increasingly offered, including help with job hunting. The report states: 'If compulsory redundancies are unavoidable, there are still steps companies can take to manage them efficiently and thereby avoid ill-feeling and loss of morale.' If the redundancies are only partial, it says, selection criteria can be used to avoid losing the most efficient and highly qualified employees. Some companies consider ability, experience or health. Bolton Metropolitan Council based its criteria on employees' attendance records. Federal Express used length of service for manual workers, but with other employees considered performance, skills, expertise and attainment of targets. Managing Redundancy.

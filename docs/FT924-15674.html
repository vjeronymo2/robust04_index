			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1992 (49): Flexibility is crucial - Few software packages perfectly match the requirements. True adaptability can be provided by supplying tools that the purchasers can use  -The right software tools for the job but many software packages never make the tools available in the first place. Most professional software designers build their systems from simple re-useable components. This enables them to change the package quickly if market conditions dictate. However, few if any of these tools are ever made available to the purchaser. This allows the developer to retain control of the software. For example, a large number of specialist packages are built around databases. The personnel management systems discussed elsewhere in this issue all have a database package at the core. Often this is a standard database, such as Oracle. Surprisingly few of the vendors highlight the advantages that this brings the system purchaser. A modern database package allows very complex, specific reports and analyses to be produced in minutes. The system at the Children's Society, (see case study: page 15) has 'soundex' searches in the Oracle layer. This means that a search for the name 'Thompson' will also match 'Thomson,' 'Thomason' and so on. It can go further and find 'Thomas' and even 'Timson,' for example. However, the system vendor has not brought this facility out to the surface and the soundex searches are not available to the users. Happily, this can be corrected by the systems staff adding a custom Oracle module themselves. It is this sort of flexibility that can make a big difference to how a company uses a software product. A large number of packages become 'shelfware' (ie they are bought - but never leave - the buyer's shelf) because they cannot perform a particular function. Although the rest of the package may be acceptable, this one lack may condemn it. For the vendor, it has the implications of little repeat business, even if they have sold the first copy. Increasingly, vendors are realising the importance of customisation and specials but the economics of software development make it prohibitively expensive. It is not viable to spend three days (at, say, Pounds 500 per day) customising a Pounds 100 package. However, it is possible for the user to tackle this instead, if the correct tools are provided. It is the users who understand their daily operations. They are the ones with experience. They alone understand the particular inter-relationships of their data. It differs for every company according to the culture and traditions of the management. While one managing director manages for cash, another looks for growth and yet another values market share. No one standard report can encapsulate the needs of all. There a number of common features between each: all will need totals and averages at some point. They will also need a set of date calculations for things like estimating current age from date of birth or length of service from date of joining. What the vendors have to do is to provide these basic tools in much the same way as calculator manufacturers provided buttons for the four common arithmetic operations. Increasingly, computer software vendors are using metaphors to try and de-mystify operations. Modern spreadsheets such as Excel mimic the traditional accountant's sheet and then add tools like 'summing' a column of figures on a single button. The entire GUI movement has been based on emulating a desktop on a screen. Thus, programs overlap on the screen and whatever you are working on floats to the top. Unfortunately, this metaphor has gone too far and many people's screens are as jumbled as their desks. Increasingly, non-computer people are becoming transformed subtly into complex programmers. City dealers build complex financial models for arbitrage calculations, little realising that they are programming. The downside is that they do not apply the disciplines that are beaten into the professional programmer - structure, layout and testing. Thus, many systems are impenetrable to an outsider. Many companies attest to the problems when the one person who developed it all leaves. This is balanced by the use of computers as an enabling technology. Queries and studies can be made that could never have been tackled before. KLM, the Dutch Airline, uses a complex rostering system which saves hundreds of thousands of pounds, (see case study: pages 8-9). It could never have been considered with a manual system. Its sickness recording system has also allowed them to decrease sick days and to highlight areas where healthcare training (such as techniques in lifting to reduce back injuries) was needed. If more data is made readily available, managers can answer more complex strategic questions. Indeed, the next problem will be selecting the relevant information from 'info-glut.' Tools are an important part of software packages to enable managers to perform their jobs more effectively. Used properly, they can cut, shape and polish information to produce a beautiful conclusion.</p>

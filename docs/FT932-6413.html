			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Arts: Coward's 'Relative Values' - Chichester Festival Theatre Sir Noel Pierce Coward wrote Relative Values in 1951 and dedicated it to his butler. The play is like an unfortunate martini which has lingered too long in the shadow of the Vermouth bottle: it is too sweet, and it lacks bite and body. But it suits the taste of director Tim Luscombe in the settled ambiance of the Festival Theatre at Chichester, where Relative Values is revived for the second time only since its opening. This is mild entertainment carried off with skill, an evening neither shaken nor stirred but rippled. Relative Values was Coward's first comedy since Blythe Spirit. It keeps an uneasy place in a tradition which looks back to Wilde and Shaw in its form, and nervously forward to the new wave of 1950s British theatre in its incipient concerns. The play flirts with English class obsession by showing class etiquette in action as the social revolution of 1945 slips into a dystropic past. Coward used the plot to serve up society in aspic. Countess Marshwood runs a house in Kent: Moxie the maid, and Crestwell the butler head a domestic entourage whose purpose is to maintain the distinctions which created it in the first place. This English calm finds itself threatened when the Countess' son proposes to marry an American film actress called Miranda. Moxie reveals that Miranda is her estranged and unknowing sister. What to do? Promote the maid to daughter-in-law? or pretend she is a friend? Both unthinkable. The Countess disrupts the impending marriage by using an American admirer of Miranda who arrives, with shameless fortuitousness, during dessert. Order reasserts itself, and Crestwell drinks to 'the final inglorious disintegration of the most unlikely dream that ever troubled the foolish heart of man - Social Equality.' As social polemic, this represents Coward at his weakest; as plot, it maintains a basic unity and credulity. Each scene pushes toward social rather than comic or dramatic consequences. In good farce, the chambermaid and the countess are of equal plot value, but in Coward the countess always pulls rank. However, the quality of the design and the acting offset the shortcomings of Coward's play. Rob Howell's beautiful wrap around screen suits the Hollywood view of England and nods at Coward's meticulous proscenium stage directions (for The Savoy Theatre) by flattening the open stage at the Chichester Theatre. It represents the inside of Marshwood House in clever trompe oeil style. Susan Hampshire as the Countess and Sarah Brightman as the American threat are neatly balanced, but Coward puts the Countess too much in control to make their exchanges exciting: 'I'm not quite as stupid as you think', says Miranda; 'I'm so glad' replies the Countess. Hampshire times the quick interchanges perfectly and her silvery voice means privilege. Elsewhere, Venetia Barrett as Lady Hayling, the battleship whom her admiral husband married, is the voice of aristocratic shock, all church fetes and outraged sensibility. Anthony Bate as the butler, proud to know his place and intelligent enough to see the choice he has made, links the scenes with limber ease. He says 'Comedies of manners swiftly become obsolete when there are no longer any manners,' predicting the play's and England's future in 1951. After all the affirmations of the status quo, it was change Coward feared most, or change beyond his control. The Countess provides the English answer - pretend nothing is happening: 'Class? Oh dear, I've forgotten what the word means.' Chichester Festival Theatre (0243 781312); in repertory until 29 July</p>

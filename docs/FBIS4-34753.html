			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" article by Manuel Navarro Escobedo: "Korea: </F> Dialogue vs. Sanctions"]    [Text] [No dateline as received] The announced talks  between DPRK President Kim Il-song and ROK President Kim  Yong-sam should contribute to greater mutual confidence, which  can ease the prevailing warlike climate and threat of sanctions  against the sides involved in the Korean peninsula's nuclear  dispute.    This summit of Kims could take place anytime and anywhere --  presumably in Pyongyang, Seoul, or, if this is not possible,  then Beijing -- with no preconditions, as expressed in the  invitation extended by the DPRK president to the ROK president  and delivered in Seoul by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter.    This would be the first time in history that the leaders of  both parts of Korea have met since the country was divided in  1948, when the North and the South declared themselves  republics. An attempt at reunification, which failed to  crystallize, was made in 1991 after several official contacts  between the two prime ministers.    Asian diplomatic sources do not rule out the PRC as the site  of the negotiations, considering this country's good relations  with the two neighboring states, and the desire to spare the  octogenarian DPRK leader a long trip.    The sources base their assertions on the fact that Beijing  is  one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council and  that, since the beginning of the problem in February 1993, the  PRC has rejected pressure tactics and threats and favored a  conciliatory solution. Beijing's veto power could cancel any UN  resolution.    In addition, Kim Il-song always uses a special train in his  short trips abroad, both to Europe and in Asia. This has been  interpreted as a sign that he cannot travel by air.    Carter, rector of a democratic foundation, traveled on a  private mission to Seoul and Pyongyang in mid-June with the goal  of finding a peaceful resolution to the complex and critical  nuclear controversy, which has kept the world on tenterhooks  because of the disturbing political and military maneuvers over  the past 16 months.    In addition, the mediation of the former White House  occupant  (1976-1980) took place at a time when the United States had  presented to the UN Security Council a draft resolution that  considers six punitive measures against the DPRK for its  reluctance to authorize a complete and thorough inspection of  its nine nuclear plants following an alleged diversion of  nuclear fuel.    Madeline Albright, Washington's delegate to the United  Nations, outlined the draft resolution's contents, which include  severe measures leading to a tight embargo if Pyongyang does not  change its position. The document, which has been endorsed by  Japan, the ROK, France, Great Britain, and other Washington  allies, proposes temporarily isolating the DPRK diplomatically,  beginning at the time when the measures are adopted. All  technical cooperation, particularly that involving nuclear  energy, and economic aid by the United Nations and its agencies  would likewise be cut off.    In an apparently concerted action, the Board of Directors of  the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] anticipated this  punitive plan and on 10 June suspended a yearly allocation of  $270,000 in technical assistance for the DPRK, which had been a  member since 1985 but has announced its decision to leave the  organization.    The draft resolution also calls for limiting Pyongyang's  activities in international organizations and establishing  controls on all scientific, economic, and educational exchanges  with the DPRK. The document bans the import and export of arms  and weapon components and all unscheduled air traffic to and  from DPRK.    This draft, prepared by Washington, which is expected to be  vetoed by the PRC and Russia -- Pyongyang's most important trade  partners -- gives the DPRK a 30-day grace period to  unconditionally fulfill the Nuclear Safeguards Agreement and the  inter-Korean accord on the denuclearization of the peninsula  signed in October 1991.    In this agreement, which was hailed by the world, the DPRK  and ROK heads of government pledged to refrain from developing,  manufacturing, or storing nuclear weapons. In direct reference  to the United States, the two countries supported the removal of  all nuclear arms from this northwest Asian region. Since it was  signed, however, the agreement has been a paper tiger.    According to unofficial reports, Pyongyang possesses nine  nuclear plants, Seoul has four, and the Pentagon has installed  more than 1,000 nuclear devices, including rockets and bombs of  various types, in U.S. military bases throughout the ROK, where  more than 40,000 soldiers are stationed.    Nevertheless, the U.S. efforts to implement punitive  measures  have virtually come to a standstill and appear unlikely to  succeed in light of Russia's and the PRC's refusal to support  the proposal and pressure from U.S. public sectors that favor a  negotiated solution.    Meanwhile, the leaders of Russia, who maintain a friendship  and cooperation agreement with Pyongyang and sell weapons to the  DPRK, have accused Washington of not consulting with them, and  they have called for an international conference among China,  Japan, the two Koreas, and the UN in an attempt to end the  conflict.    The Chinese, Pyongyang's powerful allies from the Korean war  (1950-1953), who firmly oppose any coercive measures and are  summoning the parties in the conflict to a dialogue and to  settle their differences, warn that sanctions will only engender  negative results. China says its goal is to denuclearize the  peninsula and to preserve peace and stability.    North Korea has warned, meanwhile, that sanctions would  constitute a declaration of war. It also argues that the  country does not intend to or have the capability to produce a  nuclear weapon, and it is claiming that there is a plot which,  it says, is aimed at suppressing the country's socialist  political system.    Encouraged by Washington, Seoul voiced its support for the  sanctions and consequently decreed a state of emergency for its  troops and civilian population, thereby sowing a climate of war  south of the 38th parallel.    The heated dispute has naturally created concern among U.S.  citizens, who in the long run are the ones who suffer casualties  (dead, wounded, and missing) in conflicts in which their  government gets involved. In the past, they have been  traumatized by defeats in Korea (1953) and Vietnam (1975).    This fear was reflected in a survey published by influential  NEWSWEEK magazine in its 18 June edition, the results of which  showed that the majority of U.S. citizens favor a negotiated  solution through the resumption of a high-level dialogue between  Washington and Pyongyang. So far, there have been meetings in  New York (June) and Geneva (July) in 1993. There is a  possibility that a third meeting could take place within the  next few months as a result of Jimmy Carter's mediation.    The figures published by NEWSWEEK reveal the general feeling  on the subject: 68 percent of those consulted favor a  negotiated solution, while only 25 percent prefer a hard-line  solution. In the same survey, 42 percent disapproved of  President William Clinton's policy toward Korea, which was only  supported by 31 percent.    A careful analysis of the true nature of the conflict will  take us back to 15 February 1993, when a special IAEA team tried  to carry out a special inspection of two military installations.  North Korean authorities turned back the inspection, which they  viewed as a violation of the country's sovereignty and national  independence.    Pyongyang accused the IAEA of plotting with the United  States  to conduct an espionage mission within its military centers, and  on 12 March the DPRK announced its decision to withdraw from the  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), which would have gone  into effect three months later, on 12 June, as stipulated in its  regulations. At the same time, the DPRK demanded talks with  Washington.    The DPRK joined the NPT in 1985 and signed the Nuclear  Safeguards Agreement in 1992. Since then, inspectors visited  the seven atomic energy plants subject to verification on six  occasions and certified that they were being used for peaceful  purposes.    Since then, a bitter dispute developed between the parties  involved, which were followed by intensive political efforts  conducted by several countries and the UN Security Council in an  attempt to find a satisfactory formula to ease tensions on the  Korean peninsula.    A UN Security Council resolution, approved with the  abstentions of China and Pakistan, urged the DPRK to reconsider  its withdrawal from the NPT and its refusal to permit IAEA  inspections. A refusal from the DPRK would be subject to  economic sanctions.    Washington agreed to negotiate as demanded by Pyongyang.  U.S. and DPRK representatives met at UN Headquarters in New  York. On 12 June, the DPRK temporarily delayed its withdrawal  from the NPT. The representatives again met in Geneva in July  that same year. Since then, contact at the Foreign  Ministry-level was interrupted, and there have only been brief  working sessions by officials in Beijing and New York whenever  the situation warrants.    As specific results of those ministerial meetings, the  United  States committed itself to suspend its Team Spirit annual  military exercises in South Korea and help Pyongyang change its  graphite reactors for light water reactors, which would prevent  the fabrication of nuclear weapons. In addition, it offered to  consider the possibility of establishing diplomatic relations,  and give its economic and technical support.    The DPRK agreed to resume its contacts with South Korea to  exchange ambassadors and let IAEA inspectors do their work to  guarantee safeguards.    Everything seemed to be moving along normally until April  1994, when a series of proposals, counterproposals, pressures,  and threats of sanctions again increased tension in the Korean  peninsula. This time, it was because the United States and the  IAEA suspected that the DPRK was storing plutonium extracted  from nuclear rods from its plants.    From all of this we can conclude that the next high-level  meeting between the North and South Koreas, together with  Pyongyang's offer to freeze its nuclear program and its  invitation to inspect its installations, should contribute to  reduce the current pressure and threats on the peninsula.</p>

			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Leaders set to tackle EC presidency crisis Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany will today start urgent talks with other European leaders in an attempt to head off a political crisis in the European Union following the failure of EU leaders to agree on a successor to Mr Jacques Delors as president of the European Commission. Chancellor Kohl, bitterly disappointed that his choice of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, Belgian prime minister, was blocked by a British veto, has called a special summit in Brussels on July 15 to resolve the dispute. However, informal discussions on the issue are expected to start today. Germany takes over the rotating EU presidency from Greece on Friday. Mr Kohl has the difficult task of coming up with a new candidate acceptable to all 12 member states. The bitterness of the dispute was underlined yesterday when Mr Klaus Kinkel, German foreign minister, said there was 'no need' to look for a compromise candidate despite the British veto - while Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, said there were no circumstances under which Britain would accept Mr Dehaene. 'The way in which this was handled makes it impossible for Mr Dehaene to do the job successfully for five years,' Mr Hurd told BBC's Breakfast with Frost programme. A key meeting will be when the Group of Seven industrial nations convene in Naples next month. Leaders might be able to agree on a nominee as part of a wider package of jobs including leadership of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the World Trade Organisation. Among several rumoured candidates for the Commission are Mr Peter Sutherland, outgoing Irish head of the Gatt world trade organisation, Viscount Etienne Davignon, a Belgian former industry commissioner who now heads the Societe Generale de Belgique, the Belgian conglomerate, and Mr Giuliano Amato, the former Italian prime minister. Mr Wilfried Martens, the former Belgian premier, is also being canvassed by some EU officials. The stalemate in Corfu could trigger a confrontation between member states and the European Parliament, which is due to scrutinise the Commission president-designate at its inaugural session on July 19. Efforts to agree on a successor to Mr Delors broke up early on Saturday. Mr Dehaene secured 10 votes at the end of two ballots. Mr Ruud Lubbers, Dutch prime minister, and Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU trade negotiator, later withdrew as candidates. The UK decision to continue blocking Mr Dehaene caused consternation. France and Germany were angered by the British refusal to bow to what they saw as a consensus. However, several member states - including Italy, Portugal and the Netherlands - agreed with the UK case that France and Germany had been heavy-handed in pushing Mr Dehaene. The Belgian premier remains in the race.</p>

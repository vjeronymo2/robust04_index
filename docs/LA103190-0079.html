			<p><P> October 31, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UAW-CHRYSLER ACCORD FOLLOWS INDUSTRY TREND;  </P> <P> LABOR: THE TENTATIVE PACT IS ONE THE AUTO MAKER HAD SAID IT COULDN'T AFFORD.  BUT BOTH SIDES SAY THEY WILL BENEFIT FROM THE CONTRACT.  </P> <P> The United Auto Workers and Chrysler Corp. reached a tentative agreement  Tuesday on a three-year contract, matching an industry pattern that the company  repeatedly had said it couldn't afford.  </P> <P> "It's a pattern settlement and a pattern settlement in all respects," UAW  President Owen Bieber said.  </P> <P> He was referring to a union goal set in mid-July of similar contracts for the  450,000 UAW workers at General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler.  </P> <P> Chrysler didn't give away the store, however, its chief negotiator, Anthony St.  John, said. "There are elements in this agreement that are particularly helpful  to Chrysler's case," said St. John, a Chrysler vice president.  </P> <P> The agreement covers 63,000 workers in Michigan, Missouri, Delaware, Alabama,  Illinois, Indiana, New York and Ohio.  </P> <P> Details were not released, but Chrysler appeared to have secured a new  production plan at its minivan plant in St. Louis.  </P> <P> A year ago, members of Local 110, covering about 3,500 workers at the St. Louis  factory, rejected a proposal to change from two straight shifts to three crews  on two shifts. The company said that would boost minivan production by 20% and  employment by 1,000 to 1,300 jobs.  </P> <P> Although the UAW's national leadership and the company had backed the change,  plant workers contended that it denied them any chance at overtime.  </P> <P> The contract will be reviewed by the 200-member Chrysler bargaining council in  Detroit before going to the rank and file for ratification.  </P> <P> St. John said there would be no change in the union's "30 and out" retirement  plan, which allows workers to retire when they have 30 years of seniority, no  matter how old they are.  </P> <P> The company had proposed holding off pension payments until a worker reached  60.  </P> <P> Bieber and St. John declined to answer questions about health-care provisions,  a sticking point in the talks. In the GM-Ford agreements, there was no change  in method of coverage, but the companies and the union agreed to look for ways  to cut costs.  </P> <P> Chrysler said it spent $684 million on health care last year. A company's  health-care bill is increased by a higher percentage of retirees, and Chrysler  has nearly one retiree for every active worker -- a higher proportion than GM  or Ford.  </P> <P> The UAW reached agreement with GM on Sept. 17. After that contract was  ratified, it took just six days for the union and Ford to agree.  </P> <P> The union terminated an extension of its Chrysler contract at midnight Monday  but told members to report to their jobs as usual Tuesday while bargaining  continued.  </P></p>

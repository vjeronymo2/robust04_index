			<p>BFN     [Text] A session of the Vitebsk City Council has resolved  to address the Supreme Soviet with a request to consider the  possibility of holding a nationwide referendum regarding the  issue of granting official status to the Russian language in  Belarus. The reason for such an appeal to the highest  legislative body was a poll conducted among Vitebsk residents,  which was held by an initiative group. The poll showed that  5,000 city residents support the idea of holding -- on the same  day as presidential elections -- a city-wide referendum  regarding the introduction of bilingualism. Such a stance is  also supported [words indistinct] by 52 people's deputies in the  Vitebsk City Council.</p>

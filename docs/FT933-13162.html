			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / World Trade News: UK seeks bigger US airline stakes THE UK has called on the US to allow foreign airlines to take larger stakes in US carriers. In evidence given to President Bill Clinton's emergency government commission on the US airline industry, the UK government also defended British Airways against accusations by US carriers that it was too dominant at the world's busiest international airport, London's Heathrow. Britain is keen to present a strong case to the Commission which it believes will influence talks already under way between London and Washington over reforming the rules on passenger traffic between the two countries. Earlier this week, the commission recommended tentatively that foreign airlines be allowed to own up to 49 per cent of the voting stock of US carriers. The current limit is 25 per cent. Its final report is to be published next month. The UK argued that US airlines have unfair access to the US domestic market. Most transatlantic passengers starting or ending in cities not served by UK carriers spent their entire journey on US carriers. 'Foreign airlines are effectively being denied access to one third of transatlantic traffic, approximately 3m of the 9m transatlantic passengers,' said the UK. This was 'a cause for concern'. The UK argued that BA's share of Heathrow business, at 38 per cent, was far less than most US carriers had at their main hub airports. The arguments are unlikely to sway US Department of Transportation officials. They have signalled their determination to win concessions from the UK government on US airlines' access to UK airports, especially Heathrow. Representatives from the US Department of Transportation and their UK counterparts will meet next week in London in the latest round of talks. The two transport ministers have set a deadline of April 1994 to agree on a new package.</p>

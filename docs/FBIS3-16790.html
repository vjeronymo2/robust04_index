			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sergey Blinnikov, prime minister of Karelia, a  constituent republic of the Russian Federation, has dropped out  of the race for chairmanship of the parliament. The election is  scheduled for April 17. He is expected to explain his decision  to the Supreme Soviet's session to be held in Petrozavodsk  Friday.    The incumbent Chairman Viktor Stepanov who is also running  for this position told Interfax that he regretted what happened.  He said that the interest of the electorate would not be met if  there was no alternative candidate. He also said that he did  not intend to quit the race and would not do so unless there  were important personal reasons. He described his rival's  decision as disrespectful of the electorate and thought that the  opposition would say that there was no choice in the election.    Observers noted that while 5,000 signatures were needed to  register a candidate in the election, Blinnikov's supporters had  collected 6,000 while Stepanov's had a total of 15,500  signatures.</p>

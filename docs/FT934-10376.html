			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Throgmorton launches new trust A NEW investment trust from fund management group Throgmorton aims to fill the 'financing gap' faced by many smaller companies. The Throgmorton Preferred Income Trust will buy preference shares issued by companies which wish to raise new capital. Throgmorton argues that 'despite the improvement in the economic outlook, it would appear that smaller companies are currently experiencing difficulties in obtaining borrowings on acceptable terms.' Raising money via an ordinary share issue on the stock market is expensive and Throgmorton believes that issuing preference shares will be a cost-effective alternative for companies raising sums of Pounds 2m-Pounds 3m. The costs to the company of an issue will be about Pounds 50,000 compared with between Pounds 300,000 and Pounds 400,000 for a rights issue. The trust will buy the whole of each preference issue, which will be redeemable in five to seven years. The yield on each issue will be negotiated with each company, but Throgmorton expects to receive a substantial margin over gilts with the same maturity. The trust will also take warrants to subscribe for about 5 per cent of each company's shares, in order to provide the prospect of capital growth. Preference shares were traditionally a main part of the UK stock market but since the second world war the ravages of inflation have reduced their appeal to investors. There is only about Pounds 2bn of straight (non-convertible) preference share capital outstanding. Shares in the Throgmorton trust are being placed with institutional investors at 100p each, and will offer a higher than average yield. Dividends will be paid twice yearly. Throgmorton hopes to raise between Pounds 30m and Pounds 60m to invest in 20 to 30 companies. Mr David Hughes, formerly director of corporate finance at venture capital group 3i, will manage the trust. He says the money will be gradually invested over the first year. Expenses of the issue are being restricted to 1.8 per cent (assuming the trust raises Pounds 30m). The annual management fee will be 1 per cent. The trust will be wound up after seven-and-a-half years.</p>

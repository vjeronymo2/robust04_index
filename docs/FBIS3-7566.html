			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In connection with the issue of suspected nuclear  arms development in the DPRK (North Korea), Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa said Japan would "take responsible measures  within the scope of the Constitution," if the UN Security  Council [UNSC] decides to impose sanctions against North Korea.  While hoping to settle the issue through diplomatic efforts and  avoid having to impose sanctions, the government instructed  various ministries and agencies -- with the Prime Minister's  Office playing the leading role--to study relevant laws and  ordinances, taking into account the various ways the UNSC may  consider imposing sanctions. Chinese cooperation is necessary  within the UNSC to decide on imposing sanctions against North  Korea. The effectiveness of sanctions also depends on China,  which borders North Korea. For the government, however,  studying the matter will involve constitutional issues linked to  revisions in the security policy, and human rights issues. If  imposing sanctions becomes a reality, serious political problems  are expected to develop.  <H5>  Restricting Exchanges </H5>   Japan almost imposed sanctions on North Korea in connection  with the 1983 incident in which terrorists tried to bomb ROK  VIP's in Rangoon, and the 1987 incident in which an ROK airliner  was blown up. Those sanctions consisted of four points: 1)  Restrictions on contacts between diplomats of the two nations;  2) prohibition, as a rule, on civil servants' visits to North  Korea; 3) prohibition, as a rule, on entry by North Korean civil  servants into Japan and strict screening of North Korean  civilians regarding their entry into Japan; and 4) suspension of  specially approved flights between Japan and North Korea.    This time, the government is considering the possibility of  implementing a measure to reject reentry permits to Korean  residents in Japan who have temporarily gone back home to North  Korea.    There are approximately 700,000 North and South Koreans  residing in Japan, of which about 200,000 are said to be North  Koreans. Approximately 100,000 North Korean residents have  returned there permanently since the end of the Korean war.  According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, some 15,000 North  Korean residents visited North Korea and reentered Japan in  1992. It is believed the majority of them "returned home" to  visit their relatives who have remained there. In some quarters  of the government, there are officials who strongly oppose the  idea of refusing reentry permits, judging: "Since North Korean  residents in Japan have been given permanent residence status,  it would be a problem from a humanitarian point of view to  impose restrictions on reentry permits."    The government is also considering plans to suspend trade  relations. In 1992, trade between Japan and North Korea totaled  approximately 60 billion yen. In the Foreign Exchange and  Foreign Trade Control Law, there is a provision for placing  trade under the control of the trade minister. As a result, the  application of this provision has been suggested.  <H5>  Suspension of Remittances to North Korea </H5>   In some quarters of the U.S. Congress, deep-rooted concerns  have been voiced about remittances to North Korea by residents  in Japan, arguing this may be one factor contributing to the  country's economic activity. However, the Japanese Government  does not have a good grasp of the actual situation.    The government needs to revise the finance minister's  notifications based on the Foreign Exchange Control Order [FECO]  if it wants to "stop the remittances." The FECO says that a  system, in which government approval is required to remit money  abroad, can be introduced by issuing ministerial notification  only when there are special reasons, such as UN resolutions.    In the past, such measures were taken when economic  sanctions  were imposed against Iraq and Libya. Ministry of Finance [MOF]  officials said: "Japan can cooperate with the United Nations in  imposing economic sanctions by adding North Korea to the  notification list."    On the other hand, the government can impose restrictions  on the flow of funds, money, carried out of the country by  travelers. The maximum amount of money a person can carry out  is 5 million yen. However, it seems the MOF is studying the  possibility of strengthening checkups at ports, and of taking  measures designed to reduce this limit for travelers going to  North Korea by revising ministerial notifications.    There is no doubt that such regulations will invite  criticism  that it is a discriminatory policy against North Koreans living  in Japan. After the 1987 incident, in which a Korean airliner  was blown up, violence and threats against North Koreans  residing in Japan became a social problem. At a news conference  held last month, Prime Minister Hosokawa commented on how Japan  will deal with the issue of possible sanctions against North  Korea, saying: "We must take the human rights issue into  consideration." He said this because of the aforementioned  incidents.  <H5>  Blockading the Seaborne Supply Route </H5>   The Japanese Government believes the possibility of armed  conflict on the Korean peninsula is currently very low.  However, it is inevitable that military tension will rise  should a blockade in the Sea of Japan and the Yellow Sea begin.    It is expected that most U.S. military personnel, weapons,  military ships, and aircraft will be sent to the ROK via Japan  to prepare for such a situation. U.S. military bases in Japan  will have no choice but to become strong points for supplying  fuel, ammunition, and food.    Article 6 of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty stipulates the  U.S. military can use U.S. military bases in Japan "for the  purpose of contributing to the maintenance of international  peace and security in the Far East" even when an armed attack is  not made on Japan. The Japanese and U.S. Governments are  expected to consult each other prior to using U.S. military  bases for this purpose. The Defense Agency [DA] and Foreign  Ministry interpret Article 6 to mean there are no legal problems  in using U.S. military bases in Japan.    As for the issue of Maritime Self-Defense Force [SDF] ships  joining any blockade, the majority of Japanese people think, in  relation to the right of collective self-defense which is banned  by the constitution, that "participation in the blockade is  impossible unless Japan introduces a new law that is equivalent  to the law for cooperating with UN peacekeeping operations  (PKO)" (according to a senior DA official).    The issue of logistics support, and supplying food and fuel  to U.S. military ships involved in military operations will be a  focal point. The DA is of the view that in order to provide  logistics support, it is necessary to clarify the SDF's power by  revising the Self-Defense Forces Act. It seems likely that the  issue of signing an acquisition and cross-servicing agreement  (ACSA) with the United States will emerge. This agreement is  required for Japan to offer transportation services, and to  provide ammunitions and fuel to the U.S. military.</p>

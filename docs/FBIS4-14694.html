			<p>BFN     [Text] Baku (March 31) TURAN -- Today Musavat Party made a  statement. It says that on March 29 when the session of Milli  Majlis [National Assembly] came to an end, the People's Deputy  and a member of Musavat Party, Adalyat Ragimli, was beaten  unmercifully by the Adviser of President's State Adviser, Neymat  Panakhli, in the building of the Parliament.    The essential fact is that Adalyat Ragimli criticized the  policy of the current Azeri government and their attempts to  shift the blame for the events of January 1990 onto the Popular  [People's] Front.    The Deputy was beaten in the presence of the employees of  Supreme Soviet, Minister of Internal Affairs and Procurator  General of the republic.    The statement of Musavat Party demands to take necessary  measures to punish Neymat Panakhli. "Otherwise reconciliation  between different political forces in the republic will be  impossible".</p>

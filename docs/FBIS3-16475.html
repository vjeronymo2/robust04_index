			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vasiliy Golovnin] </F>   [Text] Tokyo March 17 TASS -- Tokyo believes that Russia's  official membership of the Group of Seven industrialised  countries (G-7) should be decided gradually and "naturally" in  line with the accumulation of positive results of dialogues  between the leading industrial countries and Russia.    This was announced at a meeting between Japan's Foreign  Minister Tsutomu Hata, who is also deputy prime minister, with  Russian journalists ahead of his visit to Moscow on March 19.    Hata said Italy, which is president of the G-7 meetings this  year, will decide on inviting Russian President Boris Yeltsin to  the G-7 summit in Naples and on the form of his participation in  it.    The earlier tested scheme "seven plus one," in accordance  with which the Russian president has already participated in G-7  annual meeting, is quite suitable for discussing frankly and  openly political and economic issues of concern to all, he added.    "I consider the fact of Russia's regular participation in  G-7  meetings as important," Hata pointed out and stressed that a  change to the current formula would depend on the results of  dialogue between Moscow and the leading industrial powers of the  world.</p>

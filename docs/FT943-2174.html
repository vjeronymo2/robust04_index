			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / French appeal over access to Orly The French government yesterday raised the prospect of a new clash with the European Commission over aviation policy, announcing that it was appealing to the European Court of Justice in an attempt to delay the liberalisation of two of its most profitable domestic air routes. A statement issued by the transport ministry said that immediate competition on the routes from Orly airport in Paris to Toulouse and Marseilles would 'damage the balance of the country's internal air routes.' It called for a suspension of an April ruling by the Commission, which ordered France to open the routes by October 28, until the European Court had made its decision. The appeal is the latest step in a protracted battle to liberalise French domestic air routes. It follows a bitter struggle earlier this year concerning access to Orly airport for British carriers operating from London. The French government sought to oppose the opening of the London-Orly routes, but ultimately yielded to pressure from Brussels and Britain to allow Air UK, British Airways and TAT, its French affiliate, to fly to Orly. That agreement and commitments to facilitate international traffic to Orly helped clear the way for a FFr20bn (Pounds 2.4bn) capital injection for Air France, the loss-making state-owned carrier. A delay in the liberalisation of the two domestic routes would come as a blow to TAT, which is 49 per cent owned by British Airways. TAT officials were not available for comment yesterday, but the airline has said it wants to start services from Orly to Toulouse and Marseilles as quickly as possible. The original decision by the Commission to order the opening of the routes followed a complaint filed by TAT. Mr Bernard Bosson, French transport minister, said France was not against the principle of opening the routes in question but disagreed about the timing. The French government has said it will open the Orly-Marseilles route in April 1995 and the Orly-Toulouse route in April 1996. It has said, however, that it would limit the liberalisation of each of the routes to one new carrier. The routes are currently operated by Air Inter, the domestic affiliate of Air France. The airlines have resisted the liberalisation of profitable domestic routes, claiming that it is required by the French government to operate unprofitable routes in France.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg May 3 SAPA -- Independent Electoral  Commission [IEC] representative Helen Suzman on Tuesday [3 May]  night said a delay in incoming results was because of a "delay  all over", but she denied serious problems. The only problem  was "one or two" counting stations which had requested help with  reconciliation, she said. Asked why there was a breakdown in  the flow of results, Mrs Suzman responded: "It is because there  is a delay all over."    Reliable sources said earlier a halt to all further election  results issues had been called, and might last 24 hours.</p>

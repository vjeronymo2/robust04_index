			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / UK Company News: Diploma takes over Anachem for Pounds 10.4m DIPLOMA, the electronics, engineering and building components distributor, is moving into the biomedical market with the Pounds 10.4m purchase of a 90 per cent stake in Anachem, a distributor of liquid chemical analysis systems. Mr Christopher Thomas, chairman, said yesterday that Anachem would fit into Diploma's distribution philosophy, 'where the provision of high performance service is dependent on commited quality management and staff'. Diploma will dip into its cash pile of Pounds 26.7m - as reported at the September 30 1991 year end - to pay for the acquisition. A further payment of at least Pounds 1.3m could be due after three years to Anachem's managing director for the outstanding 10 per cent. Anachem distributes liquid chromotography systems - chemical methods of analysing mixtures by passing the liquid along absorbant materials such as chalk or paper. The liquid mixture will then separate as it seeps through. The company's main customers are pharmaceutical and biotechnology manufacturers, and research institutions. Anachem reported profits of Pounds 2.2m for the year to September 30 on sales of Pounds 11.8m. Net assets stood at Pounds 5.1m. Unpublished accounts for the six months to March 31 showed a 5 per cent rise in sales on the same period last year, and profits 'at least as high'. Anachem has Pounds 2.5m in cash.</p>

			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / International Company News: Argentaria in 25% retail expansion Argentaria, the Spanish state-controlled banking corporation which was partially privatised last year, is to raise its domestic branch network by about 25 per cent to nearly 2,000 offices with a three-year, Pta35bn (Dollars 273.4m) plan. The retail expansion follows Argentaria's failure to take over Banesto, the troubled bank group which was recapitalised earlier this year and acquired by Banco Santander in a public auction. Argentaria has a comparatively low number of domestic outlets. Rival bank Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, BBV, which also bid unsuccessfully for Banesto, has announced plans to add 250 offices to the 2,900 units of its branch network. The Argentaria investment is viewed as preparing a growth strategy in advance of a global share offering, expected next year. Argentaria claims the expansion will lift its domestic customer base to 6m clients from 5m. In the course of two offerings last year, the government raised Dollars 2.2bn by reducing public equity in the banking group to just over 50 per cent. The planned Argentaria Three disposal could place a further 25 per cent of the state's shareholding on the market.</p>

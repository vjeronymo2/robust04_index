			<p><P> July 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Higher Bid for Gateway Corp.: A group headed by Wasserstein Perella &amp; Co.  has raised its bid for the British food store chain Gateway Corp. by $71  million in an effort to defeat an offer from rival Isosceles PLC. The New York  investment firm and its partner, Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co., offered  $3.75 a share, up from $3.67. The new offer is worth about $3.34 billion. The  bidders, operating under the name Newgateway, said this was their final offer.  While the bid exceeds the $3.56-a-share cash portion of the Isosceles' offer,  it falls short of the $3.79 to $3.87 a share that Isosceles' advisers claim  their cash-and-stock bid is worth.  </P></p>

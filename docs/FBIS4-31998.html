			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 16 Jun (MTI) -- The gross debt burden of  the country has risen by HUF [Hungarian forint] 1.763 trillion  over the past three years. Of this, HUF 547 billion is from the  central budget deficit, part of which is due to the doubling of  net interest payments, according to the Finance Ministry's  report on Hungary's debts in the period between 1990 and 1993.    Government spokesperson Judit Juhasz told the press that the  situation improved only in the period between 1990 and 1992.  Last year's figures already showed a current account deficit  which was only partly counter-balanced by a considerable amount  of direct foreign investments.    Juhasz said the government had authorized the minister of  international economic relations to sign a European agreement on  the modification and extension of eased taxation terms. As a  result of this, from July 1, Hungary will be able to export  products such as meat and grain to European Union member-states  under more favourable terms.</p>

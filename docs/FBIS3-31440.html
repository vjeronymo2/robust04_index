			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with General-Major Manojlo Milovanovic, commander </F> of the general staff of the army of the Srpska republic, by  Slavoljub Kacarevic; place and date not given: "NATO Will Not  Strike"]    [Excerpts] It is said of General-Major Manojlo  Milovanovic, commander of the general staff of the army of the  Srpska republic, that he is the mastermind of this army. This  general, nicknamed "Mali" [Little] by his friends, caught our  attention when (in the first half of February] he started  negotiations in the name of the Serbian side and signed the  agreement on cease-fire around Sarajevo. [passage omitted]    [Kacarevic] Mr. General, there is plenty of talk about air  strikes. The Serbian side is supposed to meet the conditions  set by NATO by 21 February. If these strike do materialize,  what consequences will this have for the Serbian Army?    [Milovanovic] Nobody in the world wants the creation of a  Muslim state in the Balkans. They want that the peoples in the  Balkans exhaust themselves and decimate each other as much as  possible so that they could accomplish their interests more  easily. It is very well known who has what interests. For  example, France has the strongest interest in the former  Bosnia-Herzegovina, Germany in Croatia, and Turkey in the  eastern parts, that is to say, the territory of Macedonia and  Kosovo. However, nobody, perhaps with the exception of Turkey  and individual Islamic countries, wants the creation of the  Islamic state.    The West is constantly promising some sort of support to the  Muslims to keep up their combat morale. The threat of air  strikes is the best booster for Muslim morale. And all this has  been going on for over a year. Not one of their politicians has  made a statement without mentioning this possibility. In this  way, they maintain the morale of the Muslim fighters. However,  the realization of these air strikes is very complicated.  First, it is difficult to differentiate the targets and specify  what and whom to pound. Second, the world has become very much  involved in Bosnia through the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR]  and humanitarian organizations.    We are making it plain to everybody that if air strikes do  take place all foreigners on the territory of the Srpska  republic will become hostages. This also includes the  representatives of the International Red Cross, the UN High  Commissioner for Refugees [UNHCR], and, unfortunately, even  journalists.... Therefore, gentlemen, go ahead and attack!  This is one of our defense mechanisms. Furthermore, as of 1  March, they have been flying in our sky and recorded everything.  They have probably also placed numerous radio tracers [radio  lokator] on the ground, along the separating lines. However,  their problem is that they know all our capabilities [sentence  as published]. Earlier they did not know, for example, that we  can follow them all over Europe, and especially in Italy where  they are concentrating. In one combat raid, as we soldiers call  it, we can decimate their first shock group, which would consist  of some 50 to 60 aircraft. Not a single chief of a state whose  air force is taking part in the attack would be able to justify  this at home.    To become involved in such a war now would be a catastrophe,  however not for Bosnia, which has already met its fate anyway,  but for the entire world. Also, regardless of all their  technical equipment, they could, according to our estimates,  destroy 12 to 18 percent of our military hardware. This,  however, would not eliminate our advantage in military hardware  over the Muslims. The Muslims now live in 12 enclaves on the  territory of former Bosnia. They are all entirely within the  range of our arms. There are also UNPROFOR members in these  enclaves and they know very well that a sort of massacre of  international representatives would take place. We have no other  choice, we must defend ourselves.    [Kacarevic] Mr. General, is the claim of the western media  that the FRY Army is taking part in the combat on the Bosnian  battlefields correct?    [Milovanovic] This claim has recently been used for  propaganda purposes. The Western press has written extensively  about this, however, when they have remained without sufficient  proof, the matter was put off the agenda. The Yugoslav Army has  not taken place in the operations on the territory of former  Bosnia-Herzegovina since 19 May 1992. Regarding volunteers,  they are always welcome. [passage omitted]</p>

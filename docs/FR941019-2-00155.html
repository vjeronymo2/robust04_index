No. 36&hyph;04281) located in Greene County, Pennsylvania. The petitioner proposes to establish two separate and distinct primary intake escapeways during development of three-entry longwall gate sections; to have the total length of unattended supply cars maintained on the end of the supply track at 150 feet and other rail vehicles readily mobile on the longwall development section; to have a clearance of 42 inches on the wide side of the cars when an unattended trip of supply cars is parked on the supply track/intake escapeway of the three-entry development section; to periodically test the wide side clearances along the supply cars to assure that a stretcher can move through the area; and to post a reflective sign that indicates limited clearance at both the inby and outby ends of the supply cars and at the entrance of the mine. The petitioner proposes to establish two separate and distinct secondary escapeways on retreat that would be identified with signs and markers in the belt entry from the longwall face to the track entry at a distance not to exceed 1000 feet, and the minimum width of the travelway in the belt entry at two feet and maintained clear and free of obstruction; to periodically test the wide side clearances along that portion of the belt entry designated as an alternate escapeway to assure that a minimum clearance of two feet is maintained; to instruct personnel working in the area to use the primary escapeway in an emergency; to deenergize the longwall machinery and belt line when transporting persons if the primary escapeway is impassable; and to train all personnel assigned to work in the area prior to implementation of the proposed alternate method and during annual refresher training. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternative method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 2.

No. 36&hyph;08454) located in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The petitioner proposes to examine each seal for physical damage from the slope gunboat during the preshift examination after an air quantity reading is taken in by the intake portal and to test for the quantity and quality of air at the intake air split locations off the slope in the gangway portion of the working section. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 3.

No. 36&hyph;08454) located in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. Due to hazardous conditions and roof falls, certain areas of the intake air course cannot be safely traveled. The petitioner proposes to examine the intake haulage slope and primary escapeway from the gunboat/slope car with an alternative air quality evaluation at the section's intake level, and to travel and thoroughly examine these areas for hazardous conditions once a month. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternative method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

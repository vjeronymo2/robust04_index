			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / International Company News: Paramount net rises to Dollars 28m in second quarter PARAMOUNT Commun-ications, the publishing and entertainment group, continued its earnings recovery in the second quarter of its financial year, which ended on April 30. The company made a net profit of Dollars 28.3m, or 23 cents per share, in the three-month period, compared with a loss of Dollars 55m, or 47 cents a share, in the corresponding period of 1991. Mr Martin Davis, the Paramount chairman, said yesterday that the company was 'well on the road to a substantial year-to-year improvement in results.' He added that the entertainment division, which includes the Hollywood-based Paramount Pictures film and television programme studio, had generated Dollars 91.7m of operating income in the quarter, compared with a Dollars 40.6m loss a year ago. Paramount's publishing operations, which traditionally record the bulk of revenues and income in the second half of the year, suffered a Dollars 25.3m loss in the second quarter, slightly less than the Dollars 29.2m loss in the equivalent 1991 period. For the first six months of fiscal 1992 Paramount earned Dollars 46.7m, or 39 cents a share, against a loss of Dollars 62.3m, or 53 cents per share, in the first half of last year. Paramount's total revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 1992 were Dollars 927.9m, compared with Dollars 868.1m a year ago. Revenues for the first six months were Dollars 2bn, against Dollars 1.77bn in the same period of 1991. Mr Davis noted that in addition to the strong performance of Paramount's Hollywood operation, the second-quarter results also benefited from gains in the company's broadcast television holdings and from sharply higher operating income from Madison Square Garden, the New York sports and entertainment venue. Wall Street reacted indifferently to the Paramount profits recovery, and the share price was marked down Dollars 1 at Dollars 45 1/4 at the close yesterday.</p>

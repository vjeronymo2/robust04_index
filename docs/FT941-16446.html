			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Emerging Markets: News round-up Hong Kong China will this week announce another group of Chinese incorporated companies to be listed in Hong Kong. Charles Lee, chairman of the Hong Kong stock exchange, said they would be medium to small-sized firms involved in the infrastructure, transportation and telecommunications businesses. Lee added that it was possible that one or two of the companies in the group would seek listings in Europe and in the US as well. Poland The Polish government is considering introducing some form of taxation on capital gains. However, Mr Marek Borowski, the finance minister, said that the tax should be small so that it did not discourage investors or hamper the growth of the stock market, which has been a source of income. Poland has stepped up its efforts to lure more state firms into its landmark Mass Privatisation Programme before closing the list of participants at the end of this month. Mr Wieslaw Kaczmarek, the privatisation minister, met managers and union leaders from 56 state companies in an effort to persuade them to join 367 firms already enlisted for the programme. Zimbabwe Zimbabwe's central bank is to issue details soon about the new rules on increased foreign shareholdings in local firms. The central bank has already said that foreign investors would be allowed to buy up to 35 per cent of shares offered by local companies, with each individual investor limited to 10 per cent of equity offered. Israel The chairman of the Tel Aviv stock exchange is cautious about the outlook for 1994. Mr Haim Stoessel said that future developments depended increasingly on a mixture of political and economic factors that were not easily forecast. Stoessel added that 186 new companies offering their shares in 1993 and the number of shares traded reached 1,140 from 777 at the end of 1992.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov: "We Are Law-Abiding </F> People, but We Will Not Give Away Our City Property"]    [Text] I have to admit that I often hear, as of recently:  What is there for Chubays and Luzhkov to argue about? Well, I  want to say right away that I could have found some kind of  common language with Anatoliy Borisovich, had it concerned  something banal, of an everyday nature. Our conflict is not a  personal one. Primarily, we are talking about two radically  different approaches to denationalization and privatization of  property. It is a conflict of two points of view: of the Moscow  Government, and of the Committee for Management of State  Property [Goskomimushchestvo] headed by Chubays. I would like to  point out that the issue here is the attitude towards the  property that was created by the work of millions of people.  This very fact demands that we distribute the property in such a  way as not to harm those who created it. This is the concept  that was laid down as the basis for the privatization that is  going on in Moscow now, and we are defending it.    This is the reason why some are saying that Moscow is nearly  sinking the privatization process, that it is intentionally  reining it in, due to its own, parochial considerations, and,  therefore, it is ruining the system which is so orderly,  according to the Goskomimushchestvo's thinking.    At present we insist on the privatization procedure we have  chosen basically because the approach that is being defended by  the Goskomimushchestvo with such orthodox fanaticism can only  bring us, and is already doing so, to a collapse of the economy  instead of stabilization. We are not insisting on a different  approach because we are against privatization. On the contrary,  we see it as a powerful catalyst of the development of market  relations which will bring into the economy new banking and  commercial capital, new administrative structures, entrepreneurs  with a contemporary, constructive way of thinking, and good  organizers.    I have to say that Moscow was there at the very beginning of  privatization, and in number of privatized enterprises we are at  the front line, as they say. Last year we practically completed  privatization in trade, public catering, municipal and everyday  services, transportation, and construction. Small-scale, rapid  privatizing of trade facilities helped us resolve many problems  related to supplying a big city with manufactured goods and  food: More than half of all the food sold to Moscow residents  has been acquired by commercial structures. Last year the city  revenue received 21 billion rubles [R] from privatization; all  in all, we have received 37 billion since this work started. But  only an outsider can rejoice at those numbers. In reality, these  sums are so small that they constitute a very unimportant share  of our budget revenues.    This is what hides one of the aspects of our differences  with  the privatization program declared by the Goskomimushchestvo.    Free distribution of property or its sale at token prices  practically led to its being simply auctioned off. How else can  we view, for instance, the fact that functioning enterprises,  which are part of the single industrial complex of Moscow and  produce goods needed by Moscow and by all Russia, were sold as  real estate, and at 1991 prices at that. There is a multitude of  examples of such absurdity, but I will only cite one. The  Goskomimushchestvo priced ZIL [plant imeni Likhachev], the giant  of our machine building, at mere 4 billion rubles. This was at a  time when new equipment installed at the plant was valued by  experts at an incomparably higher price. The result? The ZIL  conveyors have stopped, as you know. As the plant has became a  joint-stock company, it does not have the money to pay wages,  and the plant managers have to appeal to the Government of  Moscow for help. But what do the new owners think, those who  bought the controlling bloc of shares? I do not think they are  overly concerned with the situation at the plant, with its many  thousands of workers. These people bought it cheap and are  treating it as a cheap commodity.    The ZIL story is a good example of how wasteful the  Goskomimushchestvo is in its treatment of government property.  Privatization brings practically nothing into the country's  revenue, which means that our budget does not have sufficient  sums to cover major social and investments programs.    Privatization "a la Chubays" highlights another dangerous  phenomenon. It fails to engender real owners. The workers'  collectives do not become such as they receive their enterprise  practically for nothing. Neither, definitely, does it transform  into owners those who invest their money, in the form of  vouchers, in enterprises or numerous funds. On top of that, many  people are still undecided about what to invest them in.  Meanwhile, voucher privatization is entering its final, I would  say landslide, stage. The deadline for voucher investments runs  out 1 July. And what next?    Here I would like to mention the third aspect of our  conflict. Currently, the Goskomimushchestvo is the sole owner of  all government property. This fact allows it to dictate its own  terms of privatization. But we insist on a very speedy division  of property into government and municipal. It is a matter of  principle for Moscow, given its capital status. This would allow  us to conduct privatization in such a way as not to harm the  interests of our city, to replenish its budget, and to implement  our social programs. However, we still have not received a  response to our proposal. Being law-abiding people, we, however,  do not intend to give up our city property and we definitely do  not intend to manage it thoughtlessly or negligently.    A recent session of the city government discussed the  results  of our privatization for the last year and its execution this  year. I want to emphasize right away that we are basing our work  on the government privatization program and adhere to the  approved regulatory acts. But at the same time, the program  stipulates that our city is carrying out the difficult functions  of a capital city, that we have a huge population and huge  property holdings and, therefore, the issue of managing this  property is of vital importance for us. Besides, we are entering  the final stage of voucher privatization and it is our duty to  help Moscow residents figure out where to invest their  privatization vouchers.    In our consistent privatization process we have determined  what should be privatized first, what should be done later, and  what should not be privatized at all. This, of course, refers to  the city's vital support systems.    Here is the final point. Privatization should entail the  emergence of new owners who will buy property and start  thinking, apart from profits, about the interests of Moscow and  its people.</p>

			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Management (The Growing Business): It pays to be precise - Exporting Letters of credit are examined Mike Warwick-Smith found out about the perils of letters of credit - the means by which payment is guaranteed for many exports - the hard way. He is managing director of Elsan, a Sussex company best known in the UK as a supplier of chemical toilets and healthcare chemicals. Elsan was shipping disinfectants to a new customer in the Middle East and one word was mis-spelt in a document. The ship was loading. Correcting the error might mean having to send the consignment on a later ship - and risking losing the order. He decided to let the shipment go, but his new customer's bank refused to honour the letter of credit because the documentation was not 100 per cent correct. Elsan stood to lose about Pounds 11,000 - no small sum for a company turning over Pounds 2m, about 10 per cent of it in export markets. Everything worked out in the end because the customer came back for more. Buyer and seller agreed for the cost of the initial consignment to be paid off in instalments of cash, and Warwick-Smith never made that mistake again. But many other people still do. Ian Campbell, director-general of the Institute of Export, says at least half of all letters of credit and their associated documentation have to be amended before payment can be made. Steve Beresford, NatWest's export finance specialist in Manchester, says: 'Compliance with credit terms and conditions is never easily achieved. About 65 per cent of documents presented to us in Manchester in 1993 were discrepant on first presentation.' In theory, letters of credit should be easy. An export customer opens one with his or her own bank. It amounts to a promise by the customer's bank to pay the exporter's bank when the goods have been delivered. To ensure delivery and payment, various questions must be settled, such as currency, method of shipment, port of delivery, inspection certificates prior to dispatch - proving the goods are what they are supposed to be - and correctly descriptive accompanying bills of lading during shipment. Time limits are set for delivery and the letter of credit's validity. If the details do not match exactly on all documentation, or specified procedures are not followed, the letter of credit may not be honoured. Details do not necessarily have to be 'correct' - such as through mis-spelling or typing errors in the letter of credit - provided they are consistently wrong in all the documentation. 'It's mind-boggling,' says Campbell. 'You have to check every word to make sure documents match each other and completely satisfy the conditions in the letter of credit. It's the exact match that counts, not the intention, meaning or even spelling. You can forget all this 'My word is my bond stuff'.' Nor are all letters of credit what they seem. Michael Palmer is export director of Tenby Electrical, a Birmingham manufacturer of light switches and connectors. The company turns over about Pounds 24m a year and exports are now at Pounds 8m. He received a Pounds 100,000 order in Nigeria, but had never heard of the bank issuing the letter of credit. Also, it specified shipment by air freight, which enables goods to be shifted - and stolen - faster at the receiving end. 'We asked our UK bank to confirm the letter of credit. It turned out the bank in Nigeria did not even exist. It was a straightforward fraud,' Palmer says. Other companies have been caught out in similar scams. Banks charge for confirming letters of credit. If checking leads to amendments, there will be a further fee. Mark Runiewicz of the Bank Relationship Consultancy, which tries to get clients better deals with their banks, urges caution. 'If bank charges work out at Pounds 120 and the transaction is only worth Pounds 2,000 - and that's not untypical as an export order for a small company - you may be wiping out the profits of the sale anyway,' he says. He also cites the example of an international bank which acted for both an exporter and his customer. The London branch charged Pounds 250 for confirming a letter of credit from the Hong Kong branch - in effect for confirming its own paper. Runiewicz says exporters need to think more carefully about letters of credit. Banks may like them because they offer security, but they are not always best, he says, for clinching an export sale and they add cost. Their complexity also increases the risk of things going wrong. 'The exporter should assess country risk and bank risk,' he says. He thinks trade within the European Union will increasingly be done on open account, as in the UK. Both Warwick-Smith and Palmer say the basic marketing principle of knowing your customers and markets is what really matters. In some countries, payment in advance may be the only safe way of doing business. Letters of credit and export credit insurance may be necessary in others, but regular customers who pay on time can earn the right to trade on open account wherever they are. Barclays now offers an on-line system for letters of credit and export documentation, useful for companies with many transactions capable of standardisation. There are also several stand-alone software packages available. Generally, however, these systems are more useful for importers wanting to open letters of credit in the UK. For smaller businesses, simple checklists of what to do when a letter of credit arrives in the post may be more useful than anything else. UK clearing banks have their own versions, some better than others, so it is worth collecting them. Sitpro, the Simpler Trade Procedures Board, an independent agency supported by the Department of Trade and Industry, also offers a checklist, which the Institute of Export is adopting under its own logo to offer members. Runiewicz recommends the human brain. 'Software and gizmos are all very well, but they don't solve the fundamental problems,' he says. 'Giving credit or not is a matter of judgment. Exporters can help themselves a lot more. Letters of credit are like the instructions for making model aircraft. They only work if you follow them properly.'</p>

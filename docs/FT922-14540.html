			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Bank pay deal sparks warning over German interest rates A 5.8 per cent pay package for German bank workers, agreed after the first strikes in the sector since the war, roused stern warnings at the weekend of continued high interest rates and inflation. It also heightened the prospect of disruptive action by other unions still negotiating. Average claims in manufacturing and construction are around 10 per cent. A crowd of 700 building workers demonstrating in Hamburg on Saturday heard their employers' 3.4 per cent offer described as 'a mockery'. While the bank settlement was below the 6.34 per cent accepted earlier by steel unions, it was still above the 5.5 per cent upper limit proposed last autumn - before the severity of the current economic downturn became apparent - by the government's five leading independent economic advisers. Mr Rudiger Pohl, one of the so-called five wise men, said yesterday that the Bundesbank would not be able to reduce interest rates if such settlements continued. Germany was in danger of becoming locked into long-term inflation. In present circumstances, pay awards of 4.5 per cent represented a 'justifiable medium-term limit', he added. Employers' groups said banks could afford the settlement because they were making normal profits at present. Other industries were not, and the deal should not be seen as a model for awards in manufacturing. The white-collar unions claimed the bank deal, including extra time off and other concessions, was worth 6.4 per cent overall. A jubilant Mr Gerhard Renner, chief negotiator for the DAG union, proclaimed the settlement 'a victory over pay dictatorship'. Meanwhile, a 10.5 per cent public sector claim and the employers' offer of 3.5 per cent are in arbitration following the collapse of negotiations. Engineering unions, representing the country's main wealth-creating industries and asking for 9.5 per cent, have yet to receive any offer. German inflation peaked last month and should soon be on its way down to less than 4 per cent before the end of the year, Mr Otmar Issing, chief economist at the Bundesbank, said yesterday on radio. However, growth may be weaker than forecast. The official expectation of a 1.5 per cent increase in gross national product this year was still possible, although it was less likely because the downturn might last longer than had at first been thought. Inflation in March reached 4.7 per cent, after an average for last year of 3.5 per cent.</p>

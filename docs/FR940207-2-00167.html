Each class of shares will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments of a Fund, and be identical in all respects, except as set forth below. The only differences among the various classes of shares of the same Fund will relate solely to (a) class-specific expenses consisting of (i) rule 12b&hyph;1 plan distribution and service fees, (ii) incremental transfer agency costs, and (iii) any other incremental expenses subsequently identified that should be properly allocated to one class, which shall be approved by the SEC pursuant to an amended order, (b) each class will vote separately as a class with respect to its rule 12b&hyph;1 plan, except as provided in condition 15, (c) any class may have different exchange privileges, (d) each class of shares, other than Class A shares, may have a conversion feature, and (e) any class may bear different identifying designations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The trustees of the Funds (the ``Trustees''), including a majority of the disinterested Trustees, shall have approved the Multiple Pricing System prior to the implementation of the Multiple Pricing System by the Funds. The minutes of the meetings of the Trustees regarding the deliberations of the Trustees with respect to the approvals necessary to implement the Multiple Pricing System will reflect in detail the reasons for the Trustees' determination that the Multiple Pricing System is in the best interests of both the Trust and its respective shareholders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. On an ongoing basis, the Trustees, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and otherwise, will monitor the Funds for the existence of any material conflicts between the interests of the various classes of shares. The Trustees, including a majority of the disinterested Trustees, shall take such action as is reasonably necessary to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop.The Adviser and the Distributor will be responsible for reporting any potential or existing conflicts to the Trustees. If a conflict arises, the Adviser and the Distributor at their own cost will remedy such conflict up to and including establishing a new registered management investment company. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The initial determination of the class expenses that will be allocated to a particular class and any subsequent changes thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the Trustees, including a majority of the Trustees who are not interested persons of the Trust. Any person authorized to direct the allocation and disposition of monies paid or payable by a Fund to meet class expenses shall provide to the Trustee, and the Trustees shall review, at least quarterly, a written report of the amount so expended and the purposes for which such expenditures were made. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The Trustees will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning distribution expenditures complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b&hyph;1, as it may be amended from time to time. In the statements, only distribution expenditures properly attributable to the sale of a particular class of shares will be used to support the distribution fee and service fee charged to shareholders of such class of shares. The statements, including the allocations upon which they are based, will be subject to the review and approval of the disinterested Trustees in the exercise of their fiduciary duties. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Dividends paid by a Fund with respect to each class of its shares, to the extent any dividends are paid, will be calculated in the same manner at the same time on the same day and will be in the same amount, except that distribution fee and service fee payments relating to each respective class of shares will be borne exclusively by that class, and any incremental transfer agency costs relating to a particular class of shares will be borne exclusively by that class. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the various classes and the proper allocation of expenses among such classes has been reviewed by an expert (the ``Expert''), who has rendered a report to applicants, which has been provided to the staff of the SEC that such methodology and procedures are adequate to ensure that such calculations and allocations will be made in an appropriate manner. On an ongoing basis, the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, will monitor the manner in which the calculations and allocations are being made and, based upon such review, will render at least annually a report to the Funds that the calculations and allocations are being made properly. The reports of the Expert shall be filed as part of the periodic reports filed with the SEC pursuant to sections 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act. The work papers of the Expert with respect to such reports, following request by the Funds (which the Funds agree to provide), will be available for inspection by the SEC staff upon the written request to the Trust for such work papers by a senior member of the Division of Investment Management or of a regional office of the SEC, limited to the Director, an Associate Director, the Chief Accountant, the Chief Financial Analyst, an Assistant Director, and any Regional Administrators or Associate and Assistant Administrators. The initial report of the Expert will be a ``report on policies and procedures placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness'' as defined and described in Statement of Auditing Standards No. 70 of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (the ``AICPA''), as it may be amended from time to time, or in similar auditing standards as may be adopted by the AICPA from time to time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

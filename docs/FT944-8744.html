			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Losing faith in reading Sir, Your paper should carry the following warning: 'This paper can seriously damage your faith.' Hardly a month goes by without some so-called agnostic 'scientist' or 'philosopher' insulting those of the Christian faith. I doubt if any other religion would tolerate such scorn as levied by the 'philosopher' on the back page interview of last weekend's paper (Private View, November 12/13). Dolores Rafter, Hartstown Medical Centre, 2 Hazelwood Avenue, Clonsilla, Dublin 15, Ireland</p>

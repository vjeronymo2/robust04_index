			<p>940927 FT  27 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Dissent because of misleading figures Sir, In his article (The Long View: 'When numbers deceive', September 24), Barry Riley expresses his concern at the obstacles in the way of measuring true performance. In the process, he castigates those who do not report return on capital and those who have problems with the latest accounting standard concerning acquisitions. One effect of new accounting rules passed by the majority of the Accounting Standards Board is that figures for return on capital will become increasingly misleading because reported capital will not contain the total cost of acquisitions. This was one reason for my dissenting opinion at the ASB. Donald Main, Mahogany Hall, The Common, Chipperfield, Herts WD4 9BX</p>

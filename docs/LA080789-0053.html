			<p><P> August 7, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> PLAYING IN ITALY: IT'S FANTASTICO;  </P> <P> FERRY COULD LIKE IT SO MUCH THAT HE'LL STAY  </P> <P> It sounds like a dream asignment: as much as $2 million to play about 30 games  of basketball while living amid the stunning splendors of Rome. Tooling around  town in a Lamborghini or Maserati. Postgame meals of scampi and risotto washed  down with Frascati. Midnight strolls along the Tiber or in the Piazza Navona,  where you can encounter some of the world's best ice cream or most glamorous  women.  </P> <P> Those puzzled by Danny Ferry's decision to shun the Clippers in favor of  playing in Italy for a year may not realize some of the great experiences that  may await a 22-year-old American with the imagination to expose himself to the  finest in European civilization and debauchery, with a lot of time and money to  enjoy both.  </P> <P> The whirlwind courtship that led to Ferry's snub of the Clippers in favor of  Messaggero Rome virtually assures him of superstar status in a country that has  embraced basketball with a fanaticism previously reserved only for soccer. Some  of the American players who have preceded him in going to Europe have found  life so exquisite that they decided to remain forever, in many cases marrying  native women and changing nationalities.  </P> <P> The vaunted style and hospitality will mean virtually all doors in Italian  society will be flung open. High-powered industrialists, who often serve as the  sugar daddies of European teams, are all too willing to proffer financial  advice, investment opportunities and endorsement ideas. With the help of such  well-heeled groupies, American players in Europe have been known to plunge into  lucrative sideline pursuits involving the wine-export business, veterinary  medicine, radio talk shows and the modeling of high-fashion suits in Milan.  </P> <P> On the court young Ferry will discover some pleasant advantages in choosing the  more elegant and fastidious style of the European game over the rigorous and  more brutal nature of the NBA.  </P> <P> A greater premium on shooting and the intolerance of referees for violent  jostling under the backboards will result in fewer bruises and less wear and  tear on the body. That has enabled many former NBA stars, such as Bob McAdoo  and Spencer Haywood, to prolong their careers well beyond retirement age in the  United States.  </P> <P> Road trips also will prove less grueling: Short hops from Rome to Venice bear  little in common with transcontinental red-eye trips, and gondola cruises  afford more relaxation and stimulation than hotel lobbies in Cleveland.  </P> <P> With only one or two games a week on the schedule, and a very Mediterranean  attitude toward practice sessions, professional basketball in Italy almost can  seem like the sporting pursuit of a gentleman of leisure compared to the  ruthless Darwinism of the NBA. But those appearances can be deceptive.  </P> <P> If your team does not win, forget about looking elsewhere to place the blame.  As the prized American import earning a salary more than 10 times that of the  best-paid Italian, you will be the scapegoat for losing games even if you score  40 points, pull down 20 rebounds and all but spoon-feed layups to your  teammates.  </P> <P> If you succumb to the abundance of the dining-table temptations and put on 10  or 20 pounds in the first weeks -- an affliction that strikes many of the  American players arriving in Italy -- be prepared for serious grumbling from  the owners. If your game falls below par or your team loses, be stoic when they  place you on a penitent diet of spinach and water. Or else be ready to dispense  with part of your paycheck for the hefty fines when you indulge in a pasta fix.  </P> <P> When you play away games against gritty little teams in Sardinia, where the  entire village is poised to celebrate for a week if the local team can defeat  Rome and its million-dollar American, be prepared for nothing short of  guerrilla warfare. Referees will be cowed into whistling you for fouls if you  come close to breathing on an opponent. Maniacal fans have been known to heat  up 100-lira coins with their cigarette lighters and toss them at the American  star. When the crowd runs out of change, burning cigars and cigarettes may rain  down on you -- especially if you are causing their team to lose.  </P> <P> A smart American player will make the best possible effort to learn the native  language as quickly as possible. But as you go through culture shock in the  early phase of your stay, don't be too bewildered when scenes of Babel-like  confusion surround you. Well-meaning coaches will try to bridge the  communication gap with their English, and many of the Europeans are  impressively fluent in the American lexicon of the sport. But don't lose your  cool when, in the heat of the game, you hear the coach rabidly exhorting you to  "make breakfast" when he really means you should join the fast break.  </P> <P> If you approach the season with a sense of adventure and respect for another  culture as well as an air of bemusement, you cannot fail to have a great time  as well as acquire a great education in a unique kind of life abroad. You can  always come home next year to try your luck in the NBA. But there is also a  chance you may not wish to do so.  </P></p>

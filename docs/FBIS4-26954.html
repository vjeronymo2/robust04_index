			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report compiled by editor Jiang Xia (3068 1115): "Changes </F> Take Place Quietly in the Rural Areas--Some Provincial Newspaper  Reporters Talk About Agriculture Upon Returning From  News-Covering Mission"]    [Text] Recently, our paper invited editors and reporters  from some provincial, municipal, and autonomous regional  newspapers, who are responsible for reporting on rural areas, to  a symposium in Beijing. Coming from all corners of the country,  they sat together for the purpose of discussing the question of  reporting on rural areas, but the discussions easily moved to  what they saw and heard on their news-gathering trips and their  own responses and feelings. Carried here are excerpts from  their talks. Though their feelings about the rural areas  now were mixed excitement and worry, they reached a consensus on  the following:  <H5>  The Situation: Development and Changes Are Predominant </H5>   Gong Junchun [7895 0193 4783] (LIAONING RIBAO): Changes in  Liaoning in the past few years are really encouraging. In the  past, when people from the northeast traveled southward, they  purchased rice, meat, and eggs to take home. They were known  throughout the country for this. Now agriculture is much more  developed in Liaoning. For the fourth successive year, grain  output in the province exceeded 15 billion kilograms. Not only  is this enough for local consumption but there is also some for  export. At the beginning of this year, for the first time in  history, 500 million kgs of husked and unhusked rice were sold  to Japan, and more than 600,000 live pigs and several hundred  million kgs of vegetables were sold to neighboring provinces.  Township and town enterprises have also experienced a speedy  development. Their total output value last year was 146 billion  yuan, an increase of 50 billion yuan over the previous year.  This is the result of the province adhering to the idea of  urban and rural areas serving each other and complementing each  other with their strong points.    Chen Taixiang [7115 3141 4382] (JILIN RIBAO): There used to  be more worries than joys in the situation in Jilin's rural  areas but lately there have been both worries and joys. This  year there has been a new turning point in which the joys have  outstripped the worries. The acreage of crops, investment in  agriculture, and the input of capital goods have all experienced  an increase this year over the same period last year. Peasants  are satisfied with the stability of the land contract policy,  readjustments of grain prices by the state, immediate payment in  cash by the state rather than IOUs for purchasing grain from  peasants, and measures to reduce financial burdens on peasants.    Han Zhi [7281 2535] and Xu Dongyang [1776 2639 3152]  (NEIMENGGU RIBAO): In the past, there was a drought in Inner  Mongolia nine out of 10 years. Sandstorms were almost  continuous disasters. Since the introduction of reform and  opening up, especially in the last few years, production  conditions have undergone tremendous changes. Bumper harvests  have been registered for several successive years in agriculture  and animal husbandry. Last year saw the highest grain output and  number of livestock, and the end of a 20-odd-year-long history  of importing grain from other provinces. peasants and herdsmen  are very enthusiastic in production. Last year alone, peasants  invested 280 million yuan in water conservation projects, and  herdsmen have also put 190 million yuan into the building of  natural-disaster-proof bases. The money they have invested  amounts to 70 percent of total investment.    Li Yanhui [2621 5333 6540] (TIANJIN RIBAO): Agriculture in  Tianjin is concentrated in suburban areas and its guiding idea  is to serve the city and enrich the peasants. Township and town  enterprises which were rather scattered and underdeveloped in  the past now have made overall progress. In some areas,  presentable industrial parks have taken shape and urbanization  has basically been realized in some other places.    Zeng Xianghui [2582 4382 1920] (HUBEI RIBAO): I have just  returned from a news-gathering trip to the rural areas. The  increase in the output of summer grain and oil-bearing crops  this year is expected to be the biggest in the province in  recent years. Since last year, much solid work has been done to  reduce peasant financial burdens, pay cash for grain purchased  by the state, and increase incomes. The increase in grain  prices at the end of last year has contributed to the increase  in the acreage of grain and oil-bearing crops this year.  Recently, there are signs of some kind of increase in peasant  burdens. In some parts, there is a shortage of cash to pay for  summer grain. Naturally, peasants have some worries. They are  afraid that there will be a deliberate downgrading of the grain  they sell and that they will re-experience difficulties in  selling grain.    Pang Dianxun [7894 3013 8113] (XINHUA RIBAO): The  comprehensive economic strength of Jiangsu's rural areas has  increased. The total output value of township and town  enterprises has exceeded 300 billion yuan, overtaking the output  value of urban industry for the first time. Engagement in  diversified undertakings has seen strong development. In 1993,  the average per capita income among peasants throughout the  province was more than 1,200 yuan. In the past two years,  Jiangsu was also troubled by the problem of shortages in rice  and cotton produced locally. The main reason was the low  comparative effectiveness and peasants felt that it did not pay  to grow grain and cotton. According to investigations, the  number of peasants who want to increase their income by  increasing acreage are less and less. In fact, 59 percent of  peasants want to cultivate farmland only to produce enough for  their own consumption.    Xu Shouli [1776 1343 4409] (DAZHONG RIBAO): Agriculture  and the rural economy are doing well in Shandong Province. By  last year, Shandong for the third year led the country in summer  grain production. It was also among the largest producers of  apples, peanuts, meat, eggs, dairy products, and aquatic  products. The province is also faced with difficulties.  Peasants, for example, find it difficult to deal with the  market. When making production plans and deciding projects,  they always do what others are doing and the result is that  within a given region, people are doing the same trade and  producing the same thing, causing great rises and falls in the  yield of certain products.    Wang Liya [3769 0448 0068] (HUNAN RIBAO): There are many  problems in rural areas, but if we look at the principal aspect  and the major trend, we must admit that the situation is good.  An important indication is that peasants are much more  conscious of commodities and the market and "hundreds respond to  a single call" in the market. Last year, there was virtually no  piling up of meat, poultry, eggs, aquatic products, and other  farm and sideline products.    Zhao Ruiquan [6392 3843 3123] (HEBEI RIBAO): I was also very  much impressed when I went to the rural areas. Peasants may not  understand the term "restructuring," but they are well-versed in  cultivating vegetables in plastic sheds and tending fruit trees.  If one household in a village takes the lead, the entire  village will quickly follow. Why is this? Because the economic  results are highly attractive. It is progress when peasants  proceed from this point in making production plans and  considering matters. It is also where the hope of rural  economic development lies.    Impressive progress has taken place in the rural areas.  Achievements, however, do not mean there are no problems and no  potential crises. Participants feel that the most urgent and  important thing is:  <H5>  Solid Attention Should Be Paid to Agriculture </H5>   Zhou Sixian [0719 1835 6343] (JIANGXI RIBAO): Agriculture  makes up an important proportion of the economy of Jiangxi. In  the last few decades, more than 50 billion kgs of grain has been  exported out of the province, which was a major contribution to  the country. The situation is pretty good now. In the past  year and more, leaders of the CPC Central Committee and the  State Council have discussed the issue of agriculture with  provincial, autonomous regional, and municipal leaders on  numerous occasions. As a result, over a dozen documents  concerning agriculture have been issued, indicating the  finalization of major principles and policies on agriculture and  rural work. This, however, cannot solve all the problems. Some  departments openly profess that agriculture should be  strengthened, but they are more enthusiastic in building  guesthouses and buying sedans. Many favorable policies by the  central authorities on supporting major grain and cotton  producing regions have not really been carried out. To really  strengthen the status of agriculture as the foundation of the  national economy, it is important to readjust policies so that  industry will be supportive of agriculture.    Wei Zhangguan [7614 4545 1351] (FUJIAN RIBAO): Breakthroughs  in the comprehensive development of hilly areas have been made  in Fujian in the past two years. Peasants cultivate crops to  solve the problem of food and clothing but make use of the  mountains to become well-off. There are also cases of empty  talk in developing agriculture. Some grass-roots local cadres  feel the cultivation of grain brings in very little income, and  that it is hard to produce real achievements in their official  careers. Opening up factories along the road, they believe, is  a much better alternative. The question is not just to arouse  the enthusiasm of peasants to grow grain but also to arouse the  enthusiasm of cadres at all levels to grasp agriculture and the  enthusiasm of agriculture-related departments in supporting  agriculture.    Chen Taixiang: The spirit of many policies from the central  government are not really carried out. In some areas,  grass-roots local organizations are very loose. Coverage by  wired broadcast systems has declined from 97 to 45 percent in  rural areas. Places for propagating spiritual civilization have  been reduced. At the same time, not enough work has been done  to preserve the enthusiasm of rural cadres. There are also the  tendencies of giving little publicity to what are reasonable  financial burdens for peasants.    Du Shiguo [2629 2514 0948] (HENAN RIBAO): Henan is a large  agricultural province and the general situation is pretty good.  Some areas work hard at building up agricultural production  bases to lead peasants to produce more. Rural areas face some  common problems and, in particular, people should be on special  guard against the rise of boasting and exaggeration and  formalism. There are areas that report bloated production  figures to get more favorable treatment.    Xu Shouli: One thing we should not neglect is that within  the same province, uneven economic development between different  regions is becoming more obvious. The annual income level  between peasants from the more developed areas in east Shandong  is about 1,000 yuan higher than that in underdeveloped west  Shandong. In fact, the annual income for 14 percent of the  peasants is under 500 yuan.    Li Dan [2621 0030] and Huang Shu [7806 3219] (HAINAN RIBAO):  In Hainan, the gap between the advanced and backward, the rich  and the poor is also very great. Though tremendous changes have  taken place in Hainan after the establishment of the province  and the special economic region, the job of helping poor  peasants is still a heavy one in this province, which is the  smallest in land area, the largest in sea area, and has an 80  percent peasant population. Many peasants still live in  thatched houses, and their living standard is below the poverty  line. Much of the land on the island still lies idle.  Actually, the province is most advantageously located in  developing marine products and out-of-season melons. The key is  that governments at all levels in the province should build up  crisscrossing "flyovers" between the peasants and the market.  In April this year, more than 30,000 tonnes of watermelon from  Wenchang County were sold to the north, Hong Kong, and Macao,  bringing in an income of over 50 million yuan. This alone  raised the income of the peasants and the county's revenue by 60  percent and 30 percent respectively over the same period last  year.    Wang Yuhuai [3769 3768 2037] (SHANXI RIBAO): Peasants still  run into many difficulties in entering the market with their  produce. Carrying goods to sell over a long distance, for  instance, is often based on verbal agreements instead of formal  written contracts. If changes occur in the market, they suffer  losses and find they would have been better off to sell the  produce right at their home, rather than transporting them a  long way to the market.    Gong Junchun: It is certainly not easy to solve the many  problems in rural areas. The greatest difficulty is not that  there are too many problems, nor does it lie in the obscurity of  central policies. It lies in the thinking, concepts, and  working style of some leaders. They "remember agriculture when  they are hungry but forget it they are full." They admit the  importance of developing agriculture in their speeches, but  attach little importance to it in their actions. Empty talk  will never really push agriculture to a higher level.    How do the scattered and individual farming families  enter the market? What should be done to ensure a smooth  transfer to a socialist market economy? Different areas have  different solutions. However, participants in the symposium felt  the basic way out is:  <H5>  The Means Must Be Found Among Peasants </H5>   Xu Shouli: In a large country like China, it is always  difficult to have leaders at any level come up with a universal  solution that can embrace and solve all problems. If leaders go  to the rural areas and go among the peasants, they will,  however, find solutions to some of the seemingly very difficult  problems. It may be very practical for leaders to learn from  the peasants. Of course, respecting peasant creativity does not  mean leaving them alone without any care. The responsibility of  leaders is to create favorable conditions for peasants to  explore and practice, and to be good at discovering and helping  peasants sum up and improve their experiences to guide and push  forward the overall situation.    Du Shiguo: Practice in Henan suggests that bringing  industry, agriculture, and trade together, and making  production, processing, and sales into one system are the most  effective measures to solve the contradictions between  small-scale farming and a large market. There are a number of  ways to do this, such as peasant households plus companies, or  factories plus peasant households, or processing enterprises  plus peasant households, or service organizations plus peasant  households, or specialized associations plus peasant households.  All these forms have one thing in common, i.e., they are joined  together by a production and sales contracts, a production based  system, and a service system. Wherever industry, farming, and  trade are integrated, people rarely rush for goods or find it  difficult to sell what they produce. The income of peasants in  such places has certainly increased.    Luo Xiaogang [5012 2556 1511] (SICHUAN RIBAO): In taking  their products to the market, peasants have been highly  creative. Those in Yuanba District, Guangyuan City, for  example, have established village-level companies that link  production with sales. Peasants in Nanbin District, Shizhu  County, have set up market information centers away from home to  open up markets for their home products. Sichuan is a large  agricultural province, with a farming population of 90 million.  If work is done well in agriculture, the whole province will be  doing well, and if peasants are well off, the entire province  will be rich. Therefore, how to increase the earnings of  peasants is a major issue. Restructuring agriculture is the key  to this issue. It means that, while guaranteeing a stable grain  yield, we should grasp well diversified undertakings and animal  husbandry. Raising live pigs is a pillar industry in increasing  peasant income, and there is great room for developing  high-quality farm produce. There are, indeed, conditions for  building Sichuan into China's largest meat and vegetable  producer. Restructuring agriculture also means great efforts  should be made to develop township and town enterprises. The  provincial government has decided to experiment with township  and town enterprises in 100 small cities and towns to pave the  way for the industrialization of rural areas and the integration  of urban and rural areas.    Chen Zhinong [7115 1807 6593] (ZHEJIANG RIBAO): In many  parts of Zhejiang, peasants have spontaneously decided to go in  for large-scale farming. Along with the development of  secondary and tertiary industries, many peasants want to leave  farmwork and subcontract their land to others. On the other  hand, some very experienced peasants wish to contract more land.  For the same patch of 20 mu of rice paddies, the per capita  income of one family cultivating it will obviously be several  times higher than 10 families. In Wenzhou, where large-scale  farming was done first, over 300,000 mu of land, or 15 percent  of total farmland, has been cultivated with large-scale farming  methods. More than 200,000 households, 14 percent, have  subcontracted their land. The number of experienced farming  families who wish to develop more land is on the rise, and the  scale of their farming is also increasing. Besides, to define  the property rights, invigorate small enterprises, and change  the losing situation in others, township and town enterprises  have carried out mergers, auctions, or annexation. Half of the  enterprises have adopted the share-holding system.    Pang Dianxun: In southern Jiangsu, 80 percent of peasants  have moved into the secondary and tertiary industries. As a  result, farms run by families and farms operated on the  share-holding system have become the trend. Successes in this  respect have been seen in Wuxi, Changshu, and Wuxian. In  northern Jiangsu, diversified undertakings have fattened peasant  purses. In 1993, diversified undertakings alone added 150 yuan  per capita in Yancheng.    Zeng Xianghui: Diversified undertakings have also been money  earners for peasants in Hubei. Last year, peasants in Hubei for  the first time caught up with the national average income level.  Much of the money came from diversified undertakings.    Wei Zhangguan: In more developed areas along the coast of  Fujian, land is becoming more concentrated under the operation  of experienced peasants. And a group of peasants operating on a  large scale, known as "mini-Hintons" (like farming families in  the United States represented by William Hinton), have emerged.  In the comprehensive land system reform experiment in eastern  Fujian, industrial parks with all kinds of township and town  enterprises operated by the state, overseas Chinese, and local  people have appeared.    Luo Xiaogang: Large numbers of laborers from Sichuan are  working in other provinces. Last year, more than 5 million  Sichuan laborers worked away from their home province. From a  long-term point of view, this movement of laborers has brought  gigantic changes to the employment structure and the entire  economic situation. The drift of laborers has become a  transcentury movement. It needs a certain period of time to  become more regular and should not be criticized all the time.  Much more should be done to guide the flow of laborers. The  provincial government views it as something of strategic  importance in revitalizing the rural economy in Sichuan and  proceeds from this understanding in tackling the issue.</p>

			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / International Company News: STET share offer oversubscribed DEMAND for shares and warrants in STET, the Italian state-owned company which controls the country's telecommunications activities, has almost doubled the quantity of paper on offer. The news, which follows the closure of the deal ahead of schedule on Tuesday evening, will raise L707bn (Dollars 592.1m) for IRI, the cash-strapped state holding company which controls STET. After all warrants are exercised, IRI's stake in STET will fall to around 53 per cent of its ordinary shares and just 1 per cent of its holding stock. IRI currently has about 69 per cent of STET's ordinary shares and 30 per cent of the savings stock, if all outstanding warrants are exercised. The secondary sale of equity in STET was launched on Monday. The offer was constructed in the form of 'packets', priced at L2,020,000 apiece. Each packet comprised 1,000 ordinary STET shares along with 50 warrants convertible into a further 500 ordinary shares and 100 warrants convertible into 1,000 savings shares. Around 6,700 offers, for a total of 680,000 of the 'packets' of shares and warrants being placed, were received, against the 350,000 packets on offer, according to the lead-manager, Mediobanca. Some 53 per cent of the offers had come from Italian investors and the remainder from abroad. Around 3,600 shareholders put in bids for over 215,000 packets, and will receive 175,000, according to Mediobanca.</p>

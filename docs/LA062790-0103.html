			<p><P> June 27, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IRA SAYS IT BOMBED EXCLUSIVE LONDON CLUB;  </P> <P> TERRORISM: THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT SEES THE ATTACK AS A WARNING THAT CIVILIANS  WILL NOT BE SPARED.  </P> <P> The Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility Tuesday for the powerful bomb  that shattered the ruling Conservative Party's exclusive Carlton Club in  central London the night before, and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's  government warned that the largely symbolic attack was a warning that civilians  no longer will be spared in the group's militant campaign for a united Ireland.  </P> <P> "This apparent change of tactics requires renewed vigilance on the part of  everyone," David Waddington, Britain's home secretary, told Parliament as the  two most seriously wounded victims from the blast were reported to be  recovering in Westminster Hospital.  </P> <P> Thatcher, the club's only woman member, was attending a European Community  summit meeting in Dublin when the bomb exploded at 8:30 p.m. Monday, but she  visited the site immediately after returning to London on Tuesday afternoon.  </P> <P> A dozen network television cameras followed her as she poked through the  wreckage of the 300-year-old Victorian mansion near Trafalgar Square.  </P> <P> "It is very much worse than I thought," she declared. "It gets in your throat  and nostrils. . . . These people don't like the results of democracy."  </P> <P> Thatcher speculated that the bomb may have been timed to coincide with the  Dublin summit, asserting that the guerrilla army resented recent progress in  Anglo-Irish relations.  </P> <P> The IRA's statement was issued in Dublin just after Thatcher left, and it  confirmed the worst fears of British officials who had predicted that the  outlawed group will now target ruling party politicians as well as the British  army units that have been similarly attacked in recent weeks.  </P> <P> The IRA wants to drive British forces out of Northern Ireland, and its  statement declared, "While such occupation continues, and the nationalist  people face daily oppression, the policy-makers and their military arm will not  be safe."  </P> <P> The IRA explained that it targeted the Conservative Party's posh, 158-year-old  private club because it was "the rest and recreation center for the British  government, who legislate for a military occupation of the north of Ireland."  </P> <P> "Like Brighton in 1984, the IRA has brought the war directly to those who keep  the British army on the streets and in the fields of Ireland." The Brighton  reference was to the October, 1984, bomb that ripped through the Grand Hotel  during the Conservative Party annual conference at the seaside resort on  England's south coast. Five people died in what many consider an assassination  attempt aimed at Thatcher.  </P> <P> Monday night's bomb, which police said was planted between the club's front  door and an inner security door less than an hour before the explosion, was the  most brazen attack on the British mainland since the 1984 bombing. And the  symbolism was lost on no one.  </P> <P> The bomb, declared London's prestigious daily, the Financial Times, "had been  placed at the heart not only of London, but of the Establishment. Those who  placed it had exploded the quiet preserves of members of the British governing  class."  </P> <P> Scotland Yard's chief of anti-terrorism, Cmdr. George Churchill-Coleman,  confirmed at a Tuesday news conference that "there's not much doubt" that the  IRA was behind the attack. "It is clear the same organization is behind the  bombings on the mainland. We are dealing with evil and ruthless individuals who  have no regard for human life."  </P> <P> Churchill-Coleman said investigators have determined that the bomb was a  sophisticated device consisting of 15 pounds of Semtex plastic explosives.  Police are still examining videotapes recorded by a security camera mounted  outside the club's front door for leads to the bombers' identities, he added.  </P> <P> The attack was timed to coincide with the dinner hour at the club, but, unlike  most nights at the club, there were fewer than 20 diners inside at the time,  and the most seriously injured was the club's 76-year-old porter, Charles  Henry.  </P> <P> He remained hospitalized Tuesday, as did Lord Kaberry, 82, a member of the  House of Lords. Seven others who were injured, including two Americans, were  treated at the scene or released after being hospitalized overnight.  </P></p>

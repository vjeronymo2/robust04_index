			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Unctad report urges market regulation The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, the main UN forum on development issues, is urging developing countries to improve the regulation and efficiency of domestic stock markets so as to tap the huge flows of foreign capital seeking high returns in emerging markets. This represents a big switch of policy for Unctad, which has in the past favoured loan finance from governments and banks for third world industrialisation. It reflects growing signs that foreign portfolio equity investment (FPEI) is becoming an increasingly important source of external finance for developing countries, and one that appears to be sustainable in the long term. In a report, Unctad notes that as a percentage of total long-term net resource flows FPEI has risen from 4 per cent in 1989 to 9 per cent in 1992. World Bank figures, which are on the conservative side, show that gross FPEI flows to developing nations rose from Dollars 3.5bn in 1989 to Dollars 13bn in 1992, before slipping to Dollars 11bn (Pounds 7.4bn) in 1993. FPEI is a welcome source of external finance, especially since it is not debt-creating, Unctad says. Global investors have tended to take a long-term view and foreign equity flows have not shown large fluctuations. However, the report admits that FPEI tends to increase market volatility, which is an argument for opening domestic markets gradually.</p>

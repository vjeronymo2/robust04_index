			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / International Company News: Portugal Telecom raises Es240bn Twenty-five per cent of state-owned Portugal Telecom is to be sold simultaneously in Lisbon, London and New York next May in an equity issue expected to raise about Es240bn (Dollars 1.49bn), the company said yesterday. An offer of American Depositary Receipts is to be made in New York. A second tranche, expected to raise about Es80bn, will be sold in Portugal while a third, divided into separate sections for UK and international investors, is to be sold in London. A consortium headed by Merrill Lynch, the US investment bank, will lead the global issue. The other members are Banco Essi, a Portuguese investment bank, Union Bank of Switzerland and S. G. Warburg, the London-based investment bank. Three separate valuations of Portugal Telecom are to be concluded shortly. The company expects a final value of Es800bn to Es1,000bn. Legislation setting out the terms of the sale is expected to be approved by the government later this month. Companhia Portuguesa Radio Marconi (CPRM), Portugal's intercontinental telecommunications operator, which is 49 per cent privately owned, is to be merged with Portugal Telecom before next year's equity issue, the company said. The state's holding in CPRM is to be transferred to Portugal Telecom and CPRM's private shareholders are to be offered an, as yet, undisclosed price for their shares. They will be able to use this offer as credit to acquire Portugal Telecom shares in May at the initial subscription price, without having to participate in an auction. This measure appears to rule out government approval for a proposed management buy-out of part of CPRM's operations. The international operations of CPRM, which has 40 overseas subsidiaries, could be separated from Portugal Telecom in late 1995 or 1996 and partially privatised. Portugal Telecom was formed from a merger of three state-owned companies in July, partly to gain sufficient size to acquire a place in one of the international telecommunications alliances taking shape. But this will not necessarily involve the acquisition of large holdings in Portugal Telecom. It said the equity issue would aim for as wide a dispersal of capital as possible. Limits would be fixed on individual acquisitions and Portugal Telecom's statutes would be 'armour plated' to prevent foreign companies gaining control.</p>

			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ARTICLE DISPLAYS AN 'EXCEPTIONAL TALENT'  </P> <P> How fortunate your Orange County readers are to have a writer of Joseph N.  Bell's caliber. His article entitled "Son's Dedication to Life Survives His  Irreparable Loss," (Nov. 2) is a gem. Mr. Bell's ability to extract the essence  of this tragic event, then accurately convey it to us in a deeply sensitive,  beautifully expressed manner demonstrates an exceptional talent.  </P> <P> I attended Josh Lapin's funeral and visited his family later in the week. Mr.  Bell related the Lapins' courage and closeness. He also mentioned several  quotes by Rabbi Mark S. Miller, who has a remarkable ability to lead a bereaved  family "through the valley of the shadow of death" into an affirmation of life.  </P> <P> The message we receive from this article should be read by everyone and tucked  away for the day when we seek strength and understanding of the process of  death. Although there are no words to lessen the pain the Lapins are  experiencing, I know they will cherish this writing.  </P> <P> I look for Mr. Bell's column daily and want to commend him for his ability to  provide us with the highest form of journalism, an amazing talent that captures  our hearts as well as our minds.  </P> <P> Winnie Ross, Corona del Mar  </P></p>

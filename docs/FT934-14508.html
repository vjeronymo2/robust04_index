			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Industry shops around for power INCREASING NUMBERS of companies are buying their electricity from a supplier other than their local power company, says a survey by Offer, the industry regulator, Michael Smith writes. More than half of the electricity in the competitive market is sold by electricity suppliers to customers outside the area where they have a distribution monopoly. Since electricity privatisation three years ago the 5,000 electricity consumers in England and Wales using more than 1MW have been able to shop around for their supplies. About a third of them are doing so, according to the Offer survey. PowerGen, the generator, and regional electricity companies operating outside their area, have increased their market share while that of National Power, the other large generator, has declined.</p>

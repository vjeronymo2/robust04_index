			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> W. HOLLYWOOD CONDO OWNERS LEFT IN LIMBO  </P> <P> Howard Shatsky knew that he was in trouble last month, when, after several  attempts, he couldn't enlist a real estate broker to help him sell his West  Hollywood condominium.  </P> <P> "Nobody wants to touch it," said Shatsky, who with his wife, Michelle, bought  their modest, one-bedroom condo a year ago after scraping together the $9,500  down payment.  </P> <P> Now, they want to sell it, but as the result of a state Court of Appeal ruling  that upheld a West Hollywood law prohibiting the conversion of apartment  buildings to condominiums without the city's approval, they and scores of other  condo owners are left in limbo.  </P> <P> And, convinced that they've become pawns in a legal tug of war between the city  and the developers who sold the units, some condo owners have accused city  officials of dragging their feet in finding a solution to help them.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'A Lot of Talk'  </P> <P> "We've heard a lot of talk, but that's all it is, talk," said condo owner  Landon Baretto, who angrily got up and walked out recently while two members of  the City Council met with his condominium association.  </P> <P> The ruling, issued in July by the Court of Appeal in Los Angeles, directed a  lower court to issue a restraining order barring future condominium conversions  that violate a ban imposed by West Hollywood officials in 1984.  </P> <P> But the three-judge panel left unresolved the outcome of conversions that  occurred in violation of the ban, saying West Hollywood officials are best  equipped to deal with the "variety of problems" the conversions pose.  </P> <P> City officials have interpreted the ruling as giving them control over what  happens to 26 buildings with about 600 units, at least 300 of which have been  sold to individuals whose property rights now appear to be under a cloud.  </P> <P> West Hollywood officials insist that they are not interested in penalizing  individual condo owners, saying that they want to bring to account the  developers who sold the units in violation of the ban.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Settlements Close  </P> <P> Mayor Abbe Land said last week that the city is near to settling with three of  the estimated 20 developers, which may soon clear up problems with three of the  buildings. She declined to identify the buildings or say how many units are  involved.  </P> <P> "When we get these (three) negotiations finalized, we hope that it will serve  as an incentive for a lot of the other developers to sit down and talk with  us," the mayor said.  </P> <P> The ban on conversions began as a moratorium imposed by the City Council the  day West Hollywood became a city in 1984. The council followed that up with an  ordinance in 1986 that prohibited the owners of apartment buildings from  converting rental units without first obtaining conditional-use permits from  the city.  </P> <P> After the developers who owned the buildings went ahead with the conversions,  citing permission from the county before cityhood, the city went to court to  halt the sales. But on three occasions, Los Angeles Superior Court judges ruled  in favor of the building owners.  </P> <P> City Atty. Michael Jenkins said West Hollywood is "bending over backward" in  its talks with the developers and is not seeking to levy fines against them.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Contribute Money  </P> <P> Instead, he said, they are being asked to contribute money to provide  affordable housing in West Hollywood that is roughly equivalent to the  so-called "in-lieu" fees charged developers as part of any new project.  </P> <P> Lawyers for various owners of the buildings who sold units as condos have  appealed the court decision to the state Supreme Court, which is expected to  decide by November whether to hear the matter.  </P> <P> Some condo owners, after having met with city officials, are upset that the  city has not simply exempted them from the condo conversion law and thus  dispelled the uncertainty surrounding their property titles.  </P> <P> But city officials and several lawyers familiar with the dispute say that to do  so would cause the city to lose any legal leverage it has in encouraging the  developers to come to terms.  </P> <P> "If (city officials) say, 'OK, we recognize that these are condominiums and not  apartments,' then what basis does the city have to go after the developers in  court, if need be?" real estate lawyer Phillip Chronis said.  </P> <P> "At this point, if they let the little guys off the hook, then the big guys get  off the hook with them," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Grown Impatient  </P> <P> That is no consolation to Shatsky and other condo owners who have grown  impatient in the two months since the appellate court decision.  </P> <P> "Nobody's going to buy a condo when you've got a city claiming, in effect, that  if you do, you won't really own it, because it was illegally converted,"  Shatsky said.  </P> <P> He and his wife were counting on being able to sell the condo to repay an  individual loan they obtained recently to help them buy a house in Los Angeles,  Shatsky said.  </P> <P> And, to add insult to injury, as far as they are concerned, under West  Hollywood's tough rent control law, the couple cannot charge enough rent for  their condo to cover the mortgage payment, real estate taxes and condo  association fees.  </P> <P> "It wouldn't be as bad if there was a sense that the city was concerned about  us," he said. "But here we are, trying to be patient, and who's doing anything  for us?"  </P> <P> Not everyone has been willing to wait.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Filed Suit Against City  </P> <P> Last month, Stephen and Allison Sapunor, who bought one of the affected condos  less than a week after the court ruling, filed suit against the city and the  seller, as well as the title company, escrow company and real estate broker  involved in the sale, claiming that they should have been warned about any  problems that might affect the title.  </P> <P> "To say that my clients, and, I'm sure, others as well, are innocent victims is  an understatement," said Ronald M. Greenberg, the couple's lawyer. The suit  seeks to have the couple's condo excluded from the list of properties the city  says were illegally converted.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a renters' rights activist has criticized city officials for  ignoring the plight of tenants in the former apartment buildings who were  evicted when the apartments were converted to condominiums.  </P> <P> "We sympathize with condo buyers and don't wish them any more trauma, but the  ones who got the short end of the stick were those tenants who got evicted  needlessly," said Larry Gross, executive director of the Coalition for Economic  Survival.  </P> <P> He said the city's negotiations with developers should "include some kind of  remedy for (the tenants), whether it is in the form of a financial settlement  or assisting them to obtain affordable housing."  </P></p>

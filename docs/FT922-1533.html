			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / Central banks act on fraud: Guidelines designed to prevent repeat of BCCI disaster NEW guidelines on minimum standards for bank regulation, designed to reduce the risk of big banking frauds, are to be issued over the next few weeks by the main industrial countries. The rules - to be issued by the Basle-based Committee on Banking Supervision  -are intended to give regulators additional jurisdiction over activities of banks outside their national territories. Swapping of information among regulators on banks operating in more than one country will also be encouraged by the guidelines. Regulators and central bankers from the 11 nations in the Group of 10 industrial countries - US, Japan, Germany, France, Canada, Britain, Italy, Switzerland, Sweden, the Netherlands and Belgium - are represented on the committee. It is headed by Mr Gerald Corrigan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and has been working on ways to tighten banking regulation worldwide, particularly in the light of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International scandal. Many of the defects in supervising BCCI were due to the the bank's complex management structure and its spread of operations around the world. This led to ambiguities in supervising responsibilities among national regulators, including the Bank of England. The committee will issue its directive in the form of an update of the so-called Basle Concordat on banking regulation, which was last strengthened in 1983. The new rules will in some cases put in concrete form standards which already apply in some countries. They are also intended to serve as guidelines for regulatory bodies outside the G10, especially in the developing world. The main points are: Regulatory agencies in specific countries which cover the head office of an international bank will have the right to inspect records of branches of the bank in other countries. That should make it easier for the so-called 'home' regulator to gain the information it needs to find out about, for instance, suspected fraud. If the home regulator believes the bank in question is being run improperly  -even though the improper activities may be showing up mainly in foreign operations - then it should have the power to take appropriate action. This could mean closing the bank. An individual bank should ensure its operations are organised in such a way that it can be properly supervised by a regulator in one country, at the site of a designated head office which is where its top management is based. This is designed to ensure that banks do not deliberately split management functions among several centres to make supervision more difficult. Opening of international bank branches should require the go-ahead of supervisors in both the 'home' and the 'host' country. This should avoid banks deliberately establishing operations in specific states because they feel the regulatory agencies are lax.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Beijing Political Situation" column written by Jen Hui-wen </F> (0117 1979 2429) on 30 March 1994 in Beijing: "Why Liu Huaqing  Does Not Renounce the Use of Force Against Taiwan"]    [Text] Premier Li Peng delivered his "Government Work  Report" at the Second Session of the Eighth National People's  Congress [NPC] on 10 March. When talking about the Taiwan  issue, Li pointed out: In the new year, we should continue to  unswervingly follow the policy of "peaceful reunification and  one country, two systems" and work actively to promote the great  cause of reunifying the country. It is necessary to uphold the  principle of one country and solve differences between the two  sides of the strait through increased contacts and  consultations. Moreover, at the Second Session of the Eighth  National Committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference [CPPCC] in March, Guo Pingtan, vice  president of the All-China Federation of Taiwan Compatriots,  stressed that "an awareness of Taiwan is not tantamount to an  awareness of Taiwan independence" and that "the aspiration of  Taiwan compatriots to become masters in administering Taiwan is  fair, reasonable, and just and is different from "Taiwan  independence." Consequently, some media maintain that communist  China has recently toned down the Taiwan issue, most likely in  an effort to find a mutually-acceptable breakthrough point in  the peace talks as quickly as possible. In fact, what Li Peng  and Guo Pingtan said were reaffirmations of the basic stand of  the White Paper entitled "The Taiwan Issue and the Reunification  of China," which was issued by the State Council on 1 September  1992, and this basic stand had its origin with General Secretary  Jiang Zemin's report before the 14th party congress on 12  October 1992.  <H5>  The Circumstances Under Which China Will Use Force Against </H5> Taiwan    If there should be new moves in communist China's Taiwan  policy, it is, as this writer pointed out in this column on 4  March, that the impact of Taiwan President Li Teng-hui's  "holiday diplomacy" has forced communist China to review its  tactics toward reunification with Taiwan. Specifically, it  should be prepared for both eventualities. While basing itself  on "peaceful reunification," it should also prepare for  "reunification by force." In the view of communist China,  without preparing for "reunification by force" it will be hard  to realize "peaceful reunification"; after the possibility of  "peaceful reunification" is ruled out, "reunification by force"  will become necessary.    According to a source in Beijing, it was reported in the 19  March TONGXUN JIANBAO [News Dispatches in Brief] of the CPC  Central Committee's General Office that, when talking with  People's Liberation Army [PLA] delegates attending the NPC and  CPPCC sessions on 18 March, Liu Huaqing, vice chairman of the  Central Military Commission, specifically stressed the need to  be prepared for "reunification by force."    Liu pointed out: The question of whether there will be war  between the two sides of the strait depends on the Taiwan  authorities. He said: "Reunification of the motherland through  peaceful means is the common aspiration of all Chinese. The  people on both sides are Chinese. It would be extremely  unfortunate if the compatriots on both sides should resort to  arms and kill one another due to a split in China's sovereignty  and territorial integrity. This is something that we are very  reluctant to see, but it cannot be determined by our subjective  desire. Li Teng-hui's basic strategy is to work for Taiwan  independence. If Taiwan declares independence, this should be  resolved by war. We stand firm on matters of principle. Why do  our troops retain the two characters meaning `liberation'?  Because our country has yet to be fully reunified, and it is  probably necessary to safeguard state sovereignty and  territorial integrity through military means."    Liu added: "We put forward the principle of `peaceful  reunification and one country, two systems,' i.e. achieving  reunification under the principle of `I will not eat you up nor  should you eat me up.' This expresses our greatest sincerity for  peace. So far, however, we have not seen such sincerity on the  part of Li Teng-hui. If the senior Chiang (Chiang Kai-shek) and  the junior Chiang (Chiang Ching-kuo) were still alive, they  would not tolerate `Taiwan independence,' `one China, one  Taiwan,' and `two Chinas.' Why do we say that Li Teng-hui does  not have sincerity for the peace talks? He himself knows the  answer very well. He openly pushes forward international  activities for `Taiwan independence,' supports the Democratic  Progressive Party, and squeezes out and attacks the backbone  forces in the Kuomintang who uphold one China. This is known to  all. Precisely because of this, we cannot but prepare for the  worst and make preparations for `reunification by force.'"    According to an expert on the Taiwan issue at the Chinese  Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, Liu Huqing did not  advocate "reunification by force." His original intention was  that the Taiwan people would urge the Taiwan authorities to set  store by the righteous cause of the nation and strive for the  peaceful reunification of the two sides.  <H5>  Liu Huaqing Cites 10 Facts To Show That Li Teng-hui Is </H5> Working for Taiwan Independence    The source said: In his talk, Liu cited 10 facts to show  that Li Teng-hui has persisted in working for "Taiwan  independence" since he took office as Taiwan president.    1. The roping in of and collusion with anti-China and  anti-communist congressmen and political forces in the congress  in supporting the practice of "Taiwan independence," "one China,  one Taiwan," and "two Chinas."    2. Collusion with the anti-China, anti-communist  political forces in Japan in supporting "Taiwan independence"  and engaging in the long-standing activities of being  antagonistic to the mainland.    3. Acceleration of the expansion of military strength,  incitement of hostile sentiments among Taiwan compatriots  against the mainland, and moving toward the goal of Taiwan  independence.    4. Creation of the so-called "theory of military  expansion" to sow dissension between Southeast Asian countries  and China.    5. Continued dispatch of hostile elements to the mainland  to steal intelligence on the party, government, Army, and  economy.    6. Continued provision of economic aid under various  names to overseas and outside-the-border organizations hostile  to the mainland.    7. Collusion with the Tibetan separatist, the Dalai Lama,  in conducting separatist activities.    8. Support for the British Hong Kong authorities' acts of  violating the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the agreements  between the two countries.    9. Creation of numerous incidents of shooting and killing  mainland compatriots (fishermen in the coastal areas) on the  Taiwan Strait.    10. When the Olympic Committee decided on the country to  host the 2000 Olympics last year, a major issue of principle  which had a bearing on national dignity, Taiwan voted for  Australia instead of the Chinese mainland.    As pointed out by the aforesaid expert in the Taiwan issue,  Liu Huaqing cited the fact that Li Teng-hui engages in "Taiwan  independence" activities to enable PLA officers and men to  clearly understand Li Teng-hui's true colors and to warn Li not  to go further down the path of "Taiwan independence" or even  count on the involvement of the United States and other Western  countries in supporting "Taiwan independence." Otherwise, a war  to liberate Taiwan will become inevitable.  <H5>  Deng Xiaoping Wants To Curb Taiwan Independence Through </H5> Economic Links    The source added: To work for peaceful reunification with  Taiwan, communist China has adopted a series of measures to  boost development in cross-strait relations. On the political  front, those going to Taiwan will no longer be held accountable  for the crimes they committed before the founding of the PRC.  On the military front, the shelling of Jinmen and other islands  have been suspended, and some forward positions and observation  posts in the coastal areas of Fujian are being turned into  economic development zones or tourist spots. On the economic  front, the mainland has opened the door wide to promote  exchanges. Taiwan businessmen are welcome to invest in the  mainland or carry out trade activities; in fact, the mainland  has given them preferential terms and legal guarantees. On  other fronts, such as personnel contacts, post and  telecommunications, communications, science and technology,  culture, sports, academic research, and news, the mainland is  also vigorously encouraging exchanges and cooperation. The  mainland has set up the Association for Relations Across the  Taiwan Strait, a government-sanctioned nongovernmental  organization, to establish contacts with the Straits Exchange  Foundation and other relevant nongovernmental organizations in  Taiwan to boost development in cross-strait relations. The  Wang-Koo meeting held in April 1993, during which four  agreements were signed, represents an important step of  historical significance in cross-strait relations. An  atmosphere of relaxation, which has never been seen in the past  40 years and more, has emerged in the Taiwan Strait. This is  favorable to peaceful reunification.    Of the numerous measures, Deng Xiaoping reportedly puts  particular emphasis on the need to increase cross-strait  economic links. He said: "By closely linking the economy of  the two sides we can curb `Taiwan independence' to a maximum  degree." To this end, the communist Chinese authorities  recently approved the establishment of several Taiwan investment  zones in the coastal areas to suit the situation of Taiwan  investments on the mainland. Meanwhile, at its sixth meeting in  March this year, the Eighth NPC Standing Committee approved the  "Law of the PRC on Protecting Investments by Taiwan  Compatriots." The protection of Taiwan investments in terms of  a law will further promote cross-strait economic cooperation.    However, as the Kuomintang and the CPC have many  long-standing grievances against one another, plus the fact that  the international forces support "Taiwan independence" by every  possible means, people dare not be optimistic about the prospect  of the two sides burying the hatchet.</p>

			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Business and the Law: Ruling on EU's competence - European Court The European Union has exclusive competence to conclude international agreements relating to goods, but its competence in respect of agreements on services and intellectual property is to be shared with the member states, the European Court of Justice ruled last week. The Court's opinion had been sought by the European Commission in the context of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade Uruguay Round agreements. At the start of the round in 1986, the Commission was granted the power to negotiate on behalf of the European Community and the member states. However, it was stated that this did not prejudge the question of the competence of the Community and the member states on particular issues. The final act and the WTO agreement were signed by the Council of Ministers, the Commission and the member states. Prior to the date of signature, the Commission sought the Court's opinion as to the EU's competence in concluding agreements in three areas - goods, services and intellectual property. The Court said it was generally clear the Community had exclusive competence to conclude international agreements relating to goods. Such goods included products under the Euratom Treaty. For products covered by the European Coal and Steel Treaty, member states had exclusive competence. The Community had exclusive competence, on the other hand, for international agreements which covered different types of goods, including those within the ECSC Treaty. For agricultural products, while it was true that a specific Treaty of Rome provision relating to agriculture served as the legal base for the agreement on agriculture, this fact did not impede the international commitments relating to agricultural products from being covered by the EC treaty provisions relating to the common commercial policy. These gave the Community exclusive competence. In relation to services, the Court first reiterated that the common commercial policy provisions of the Rome treaty were to be interpreted widely and the examples given in the relevant treaty provisions treated as non-exhaustive. Thus services were not excluded as a matter of principle from the scope of the common commercial policy. Insofar as the relevant agreement on services  -the GATS - was concerned, the Court said there was no reason why trans-frontier supplies of services should not be treated in the same way as goods and therefore be covered by the common commercial policy, for which the Community has exclusive competence. Other types of services - where the beneficiary of the service went physically to the state where the service was provided, where a subsidiary was established in the state where the service was to be provided, and where individuals supplied services to other states - did not come within the scope of the common commercial policy. The Court also held specifically that transport services did not fall within the common commercial policy. The mere fact that embargo measures taken by the Council which affected transport services were taken under the common commercial policy did not change this position. However, the Court did hold that the Community shared competence with the member states to conclude the GATS. In making this finding, the Court relied on, among others, the internal market provisions of the Rome treaty which allowed any related harmonisation measures to limit the powers of the member states to negotiate with third countries. In respect of intellectual property, the Court said provisions in the TRIPs agreement concerning the prohibition on counterfeit goods were covered by the common commercial policy. Other provisions not so closely connected with external trade were not within the Community's exclusive competence. However, as with the GATS, the Court said the Community shared competence with the member states to conclude the TRIPs. Finally, the Court said, notwithstanding its opinion, it was necessary to bear in mind the obligation on member states and the EU to co-operate closely in international matters. Opinion 1/94, ECJ FC, November 15 1994.</p>

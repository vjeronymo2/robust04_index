			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [EC Document No. DOC/PESC/94/50: "Declaration by the </F> European Union on Rwanda"]    [Text] The European Union, recalling its declaration of 18  April 1994 on Rwanda, again appeals urgently to all parties to  the conflict to bring an end to the genocide now taking place in  the country.    The European Union expresses its full support for the United  Nations' humanitarian efforts and in this context welcomes the  resolution that is currently before the Security Council. The  European Union looks forward to an urgent decision on measures  which can be implemented soon.    The European Union welcomes the initiative of the United  Nations High Commissioner on human rights to conduct a mission  to both Rwanda and Burundi and supports the call for a special  meeting of the UN Commission on human rights.    The European Union expresses its appreciation and support  for  the efforts of the OAU and to President Mwinyi of Tanzania for  their initiatives in convening a regional conference, in which  both the authorities of Rwanda and the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic  Front] will be invited.    The European Union urges the two sides to agree on the need  to respect the Arusha Agreement, which, through the way of  negotiation, offers the best available basis for national  reconciliation. In this context the European Union supports the  call for an early imposition of an arms embargo on Rwanda, and  calls on all concerned to refrain from any action that is liable  to exacerbate the situation.    The European Union is eager to increase its humanitarian aid  whenever and where such aid can be brought to the populations  that have suffered so cruelly from the violence. In this  respect it will continue its immediate assistance to refugees in  the neighbouring countries and will endeavour to equally assist  the stricken populations within Rwanda, whenever conditions  allow this.    The European Union has decided on 6 May 1994 to dispatch a  Troika mission, on a development ministers level, to visit as  soon as possible the countries neighbouring Rwanda, with a view  to evaluating the humanitarian situation vis-a-vis the influx of  the refugees.</p>

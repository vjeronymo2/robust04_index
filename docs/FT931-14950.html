			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Silent phone language Deaf people will be able to talk to each other by telephone with a videophone being developed by British Telecom. BT claims it is the only company working on a system aimed at people who are deaf or have impaired hearing. Users could use sign language and lip-reading. A video link would solve the problems of textphones, which are slow to use and thus cost more than speech phones. BT says sign language is as fast as speech and more acceptable than text. BT is refining the system after field trials and examining ways of reducing costs. BT Laboratories: UK, 0473 647448.</p>

			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Defiant Clarke pledges to maintain recovery Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, told the Commons last night that the package of taxation measures and public spending cuts he would unveil tomorrow would ensure that the strength of the economic recovery was sustained. Ignoring cries of 'resign' from jeering Labour MPs he made it clear that the proposals would fill the gap in his Budget calculations resulting from the government's dramatic eight-vote defeat (319-311). The result meant Labour had succeeded in its bid to prevent the planned increase from 8 per cent to 17.5 per cent value added tax on domestic fuel from April. The Conservative MPs who voted against the government were: Mr Michael Carttiss, Mr Paul Marland, Mr Tony Marlow, Mr Richard Shepherd, Mr David Sumberg, Mrs Ann Winterton, and Mr Nicholas Winterton. Tories who abstained were: Mr Phil Gallie, Mr Christopher Gill, Sir Richard Body, Sir Rhodes Boyson, Mrs Teresa Gorman, Mr William Powell, Sir Teddy Taylor and Mr John Wilkinson. Jubilant Labour MPs cheered when Mr Clarke undertook to include a clause in the forthcoming finance bill to hold the VAT on domestic fuel at the 8 per cent rate. He said his package of measures to fill the gap caused by Labour's 'opportunistic' manoeuvre would be designed to ensure that the scheduled reduction in the public sector borrowing requirement remained on course. Mr Clarke said: 'Proceeding in that way is essential to keep this recovery on course to achieve the prosperity and jobs we need in this country.' Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, said the move to increase VAT on domestic had been stopped dead in its tracks. He described it as a 'humiliating defeat' for the cabinet, for the chancellor and for Mr John Major, the prime minister. Mr Brown said VAT should never have been imposed on domestic fuel in the first place in view of the pledges given by the prime minister that its scope would not be extended. Mr Major gestured in irritation when Mr Brown insisted that 'promises made by political parties at elections should be kept'. The shadow chancellor told protesting Tory backbenchers that they would have to listen to the British people. He said that the government's defeat signalled a turning point in British politics. To further Labour cheers he said: 'The Conservative party may remain in office. But they are tired. They are discredited and they are out of touch.' Ministers scoffed when Mr Brown said that it was the Labour party that now represented and spoke for the people of Britain. Mr Clarke rejected a suggestion by Mr Brown that he should consult opposition leaders before reaching decisions about the package of proposals to be unveiled tomorrow. Backed by government cheers the chancellor said that the failure of Labour MPs to produce any practical proposals to replace the revenue lost by keeping VAT on domestic fuel at 8 per cent showed that they were 'utterly unfitted to take forward the affairs of this country'. Mr Clarke said Labour MPs had been irresponsible as well as opportunistic in defeating the government. 'They may gloat today, but we have the responsibility of keeping British industry on course tomorrow,' he said. Mr Malcolm Bruce, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, said the government had suffered a 'monumental rejection' of its policies. A discredited government had been rejected by the Commons and it should get out, he said.</p>

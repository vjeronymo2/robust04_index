			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Free-market gunslingers lose their fire: A look at an organisation true to its code As the Institute of Directors prepares for a change of leadership, Britain's main organisation for business leaders is stoical about its future. The organisation which chose 'thriving on change' as the theme for yesterday's annual convention has no plans to do so. The event was only just saved from being a flop by the vigour of the mid-afternoon speech by Mr Peter Morgan, the outgoing director-general. Last year's affair was a hard act to follow, with Mr Bill Gates of Microsoft among speakers who pulled in some 3,200 delegates. This year's poor attendance - fewer than the 2,800 delegates registered - was evidence of a deeper problem for the IoD. A standard bearer for enterprise, the free market and free trade, the IoD was in its prime during the Thatcher era. But whereas in the 1980s it was pushing on an open door in its pleas for de-regulation, it is now meeting more resistance. With a member seconded to the Department of Trade and Industry to explore and promote ways of cutting regulation, the IoD claims it is still scoring victories for its small-business constituency. But it admits that the climate has changed. What it disputes is that the change has made it redundant. 'We are not in a popularity contest,' says Mr Gordon Leak, head of media communications. 'We are there to represent our members. The political pendulum is not a factor in the IoD's thinking - principles are.' The change makes its lobbying function more necessary rather than less so, it argues. But, more than that, it believes that the nature of the recovery is going to raise its profile as an educator and promoter of small business. 'Employment in the private sector will never be the same again,' Mr Morgan declared yesterday, echoing the IoD belief that growth is going to rest principally on a rise in entrepreneurs. Where the IoD differs from the resurgent Confederation of British Industry, it says, is in the IoD's emphasis on the individual. Its members certainly believe that to be the case. 'The IoD represents the small businessman, where the CBI is more the organisation for big business like the ICIs - although the CBI would deny this,' said one delegate yesterday. In spite of such loyalty, the IoD has come off the boil, with membership of about 33,000 in Britain and 48,000 worldwide, down about 5,000 from its peak. But recruitment is picking up and the IoD can expect to lose fewer members to bankruptcy. Holding true to the faith, its loyal core may argue in stronger and stronger tones that being out in the cold makes the organisation's voice ever more necessary, but it is also likely to make the annual convention ever more of a fringe event.</p>

			<p><P> December 31, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LOOKING TO 1991;  </P> <P> THE NEW YEAR PROMISES TREMENDOUS PROGRESS, FRUSTRATING SETBACKS AND DAUNTING  CHALLENGES FOR ORANGE COUNTY. THERE IS TRANSPORTATION MONEY APLENTY, BUT SOCIAL  SERVICE AGENCIES COULD GO BEGGING. STRIDES ARE EXPECTED ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL  FRONT, BUT EDUCATORS WILL HAVE TO DO MORE WITH LESS AND FIGHT FOR EVERY DOLLAR  FROM THE STATE.  </P> <P> After a year highlighted by a series of development battles, 1991 opens with  the county housing market on the skids. As a result, those issues may recede in  the coming year. Tranquility will come at a price, however: Fewer new homes  means fewer housing permits and fewer new taxpayers at a time when local  governments are desperate for money.  </P> <P> Hardest hit will be the county's growing underclass. Health services for poor  people were cut in 1990, and will likely be hit harder in 1991. Demand,  however, will soar. The slowing economy brings a host of problems, all of which  cost money to treat: Unemployment means more workers seeking welfare, more  families requesting Aid to Families with Dependent Children, more homeless  people in dire need of shelter.  </P> <P> In addition to its other budget woes, the county Board of Supervisors must  tackle the politically explosive question of acquiring land for a new jail,  most likely in Gypsum Canyon near Anaheim.  </P> <P> Environmentalists and educators will have battles of their own. Toxic waste  dumpers will get a tougher look from the Orange County district attorney, and a  local school district is joining others across the state in taking the case for  more state funding to court.  </P> <P> Yet, while some services struggle to get by, others will suffer from an  embarrassment of riches: Barring a court challenge, the new county half-cent  tax for transportation goes into effect on April 1, and new road construction  will not be far behind.  </P> <P> And even as local leaders chart the county's course through a rough-and-tumble  year, the 1990 census will provide a new snapshot of who we are. The census  will confirm the county's explosive growth during the past decade, paving the  way for a new congressional seat and rejiggered supervisorial districts. But it  will probably also reveal an increasingly diverse and complex county, one where  poverty and unemployment have found a foothold in a land long known for its  affluence.  </P> <P> With all those issues coming together at once, 1991 promises to be a daunting  one for the County Board of Supervisors. And at the same time that the board  prepares to unravel its myriad budget and social problems, a political storm is  quietly gathering as well. After nine years of relative tranquility, the new  census findings will bring the return of reapportionment, the once-a-decade  process of trimming territory from fast-growing supervisorial districts and  tacking it on the slower-growing ones.  </P> <P> That means that Supervisors Thomas F. Riley and Gaddi H. Vasquez, whose  districts cover the booming areas of south and east Orange County, will each  lose turf. Supervisors Don R. Roth, Roger R. Stanton and Harriett M. Wieder  will pick up ground because their districts have grown more slowly since the  1980 census.  </P> <P> Although the board represents residents of the whole county, supervisors are  elected by their individual districts, and fussing with the boundaries is sure  to stir political rivalries. While redistricting is unlikely to affect many  significant policy matters, it will make a difference to constituents seeking  their supervisor's help.  </P> <P> Costa Mesa residents, for instance, may soon find that Riley is no longer their  voice on the board. In order to balance out the growth in Riley's district,  that city may wind up with Stanton or Wieder, or perhaps split between them.  </P> <P> If it were just a mathematical equation, redistricting would be complicated but  relatively uncontroversial. But it is not.  </P> <P> "I would like to think we could do this pretty quickly," Riley said. "But the  last time, we did have some challenges, and I expect we will again."  </P> <P> Supervisors traditionally use reapportionment as an opportunity to strengthen  their political base, carving out precincts that they have struggled to carry  in exchange for areas where their support may be stronger.  </P> <P> At the center of that shuffling in 1991 will be Vasquez, who takes over as the  board's new chairman in January. Vasquez has indicated to some of his  colleagues that he would like to shift his district northward, dropping some  South County precinc That would surprise few obserdistrict has caused him  problems.  </P> <P> In 1990, for instance, some Vasquez constituents in Lake Forest expressed  dismay at the supervisor's continued opposition to a new jail in Gypsum Canyon.  Vasquez's north county constituents applaud that position of keeping a new jail  away from them, but building the Gypsum Canyon facility would allow the county  to close the James A. Musick Branch Jail near Lake Forest. It's an issue that  pits one half of his district against the other -- a nettlesome problem, but  one that reapportionment may offer the opportunity to resolve.  </P></p>

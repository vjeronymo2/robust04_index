			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Most companies, of course, are not eligible for prime-rate loans. For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> them, the terms of borrowing are generally less favorable. While  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DRI/McGraw-Hill does not forecast long-term, non-prime loan rates, some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> insight can be gained from how such loans rates differ from prime loan rates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on a telephone conversation with the Federal Reserve System, DOE  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> learned that most commercial loans were in the 6 percent to 15 percent range.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Using the higher rate, 15 percent, and deducting the applicable changes in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumer price index, the Department calculated real rates of interest ranging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from 10.1 percent in 2014 to 11.2 percent in 1995, with a 21-year average of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10.46 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alternatively, the Department looked at the divergence of the 15 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loans from the then current prime rate; such loans were 50 percent greater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than the 10 percent prime rate prevailing in 1990. By applying a 50 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase to the projected prime interest rates, the Department obtained  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nominal rates of interest of 12.56 percent to 12.75 percent. After a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deduction of the expected changes in the consumer price index, real rates of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest ranged from 7.76 percent to 9.87 percent, averaging 8.05 percent over  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the 21-year period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another possible financing mechanism would be for the corporation to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> finance the purchase of the more efficient equipment by displacing investment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capital. In Table 8 of DRI/McGraw-Hill's forecasts, there are annual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projections of the after-tax costs of financial capital for each year between  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1995 and 2015. After converting the numbers to pre-tax costs, and after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deducting the expected changes in the consumer price index, the Department  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obtained the respective real rates of interest. The costs of financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capital are projected to range from 11.61 percent in 1995 to 12.86 percent in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2015. The consumer price index rates forecasts are the same as before, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the resulting real finance rates range from 7.67 percent in 2000 to 7.96  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent in 2015, with the 21-year average being 7.86 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Of the different possible means of companies paying for conservation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> improvements in lighting equipment, the range of real rates of interest is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from 3.55 percent to 11.12 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Economic theory suggests that in deriving a commercial discount rate,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Department should consider the opportunity costs of commercial investments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that were foregone. Therefore, the Department also investigated real rates of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> return from commercial investment activities between 1961 and 1990. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data were compiled from Annual Statistical Digests of the Board of Governors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Federal Reserve System. The variables that were examined were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commercial trade credit, i.e., bankers acceptances; time deposits, i.e.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certificates of deposits; U.S. Treasury securities; and commercial paper.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the 30-year period, the average real investment returns realized in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commercial sector ranged from 2.02 percent for bankers' acceptances (which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constituted 70 percent of the investment dollars), to 2.29 percent for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investments in Treasury securities (which constituted 9 percent of commercial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investment dollars).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When more risky investments, such as tax-exempt (class B) and corporate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (AA) bonds were examined, their real rates were 1.27 percent and 3.52 percent,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respectively, over the 1970-to-1986 period. These real rates, too, were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantially outside of the purchase finance range. The real rates for such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bonds in earlier years also fell below the purchase financing range of rates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After considering the above, the Department elected to use four percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as the commercial discount rate. The Department believes that this rate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximates the real costs likely to be incurred by private businesses which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are able to finance small additional investments in energy efficiency by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reducing relatively liquid corporate investments, e.g., bankers' acceptances,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or by obtaining loans at or near the prime interest rate, without diminishing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their normal business investment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, if increasing investments in more energy efficient technology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are assumed to displace other, more profitable business investments, or would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require loans available only at more typical commercial interest rates, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximate discount rate would be higher. For example, between 1980 and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1991, the real rates of return to nonfinancial corporations averaged between 7  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and 8 percent based on data contained in Table 1.16 of the National Income and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Product Accounts, as presented in the Department of Commerce's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Survey of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Current Business  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and, as noted above, real commercial interest rates often  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceeded 7 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

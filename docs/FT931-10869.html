			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / French premier hits at UK's 'dead-end' economic policy BRITAIN WAS heading down a dead-end, Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French prime minister, said yesterday in his strongest attack yet on UK economic and monetary policies. 'I feel today that Britain is going down a dead-end path. And that is true for everything,' he said. UK interest rate cuts and the reduction in the value of sterling had not helped the economy to recover, he said. 'You can see that confidence is not coming back and unemployment in Britain is rising at a pace clearly faster than elsewhere.' He said Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, was the victim of the radical free-market policies of his predecessor, Lady Thatcher. Mr Beregovoy's outburst will increase tensions in Franco-British relations, placed under fresh strain recently by the controversial decision of Hoover, the US appliance maker, to close a plant near Dijon and shift production to Scotland. 'You can see where unfettered liberalism gets you,' said Mr Beregovoy. 'The Scottish workers, a pistol loaded with job cuts at their heads, have agreed to give up employment rights, the right to strike, and accepted a blow to their pension funds and wage cuts.' His remarks also reflect suspicion in some French government quarters that US and UK pressure was an element in the recent speculative attacks against the franc, though this could ease following the Bundesbank's rates cut, announced after his statement. Mr Beregovoy called for a meeting of finance ministers of the Group of Seven industrialised nations to discuss a world growth initiative. 'It is European co-operation and international co-operation which can conjure up stronger growth in the months to come,' he said. The EC should react strongly to recent US trade measures against European products. Philip Stephens, Political Editor, writes: Downing Street signalled that Mr Major was not prepared to engage in a slanging match with the French prime minister although he could defend strongly both Britain's interest rate policy and the assistance which persuaded Hoover to relocate. The view at Westminster was that the approach of the French general election would prompt politicians on all sides to seek votes by taking swipes at Britain.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The new pension and health system was greeted with  certain reservations by the Colombian financial system. In  giving the reason for their reservations, the financial  institutions argue that a number of inequities place private  pension funds at a disadvantage compared with the Social  Security Institute (ISS).    Nevertheless, it is hoped that with proper regulations, not  only will there be greater competition, but also a smooth  implementation of the law.    For insurers, the reform is a positive step because it ends  the government monopoly over pensions and health care and  launches a process consisting in offering a pension based on the  savings of every worker.    In addition, it is emphasized that for the first time in the  country's history, competition is allowed between public and  private entities, with complete freedom for every worker to  choose between the systems based on the quality of services  offered in terms of pensions and health care.    There is one drawback, however: The cost of the reform aimed  at expanding retirement and health care coverage will be  substantial.    William Fadul, president of the Union of Colombian Insurers  (FASECOLDA), said it will be necessary to review differences  established in the number of weeks of payment required and the  age at which one becomes eligible for a pension, as well as the  generous criteria for determining disability.    For the National Association of Financial Institutions  (ANIF), the reform could be described as "battered but  surviving," inasmuch as the imbalances favor the ISS.    "They did everything possible to discriminate against the  funds, meaning that the workers earning the lowest wages will  have to pay a kind of toll to join," ANIF President Javier  Fernandez Riva said.    He emphasized the workers' freedom to choose because it will  promote competitiion and improve ISS services, but he is  concerned that before one may transfer to a fund, a statement  before a notary is required.    Invertir [Invest] President Fernando Borda said the reform  is  good, but could have been better. He did admit, however, that it  was impossible to do more because it was very difficult to  juggle the interests of employers, workers, financial  institutions, and the unions.    He said that for those earning over the minimum wage, it may  be better to join a private fund because with a good yield, a  larger pension can be had.    Invermanana President Juan Francisco Hernandez said that  much  of the working population earning the minimum wage should stick  with the ISS because if a minimum wage is guaranteed, why pay  150 weeks more?</p>

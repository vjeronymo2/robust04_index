			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Eliza Olczyk: "Politicians Like To Be Silent; </F> Escape From the Media"]    [Text] Political meetings closed to the press are an  ordinary matter for politicians today. After a short period of  general openness of the political life, which was, perhaps, only  during the term of office of the "contract" Sejm, we saw a  comeback to a secret life. There is usually one rule: The  opposition meets and discusses matters openly, whereas the  governing parties hold meetings behind closed doors.    The opposition which invites mass media to all its meetings,  organizes press conferences, and shares information whenever  journalists want it, stresses in this way that it has nothing to  hide from the people. This attitude changes radically the  moment the opposition becomes a governing party.  <H5>  Through a Ladder to Lansk </H5>   It should be admitted that as far as avoiding journalists or  giving evasive answers is concerned, the consecutive governing  parties display inexhaustible invention.    After one of the meetings of the directorate (that is, the  leadership of the present governing coalition) last autumn,  journalists learned that the politicians discussed... potato  harvesting.    After submitting his resignation from the post of deputy  prime minister and finance minister, Marek Borowski entrenched  himself in his office and it was difficult to "squeeze" a word  of comment out of him.    The ladder that Democratic Left Alliance leader Aleksander  Kwasniewski used to leave the Sejm premises will probably go  down in the history of the Polish parliamentary system.    Recently sessions of politicians held outside Warsaw have  been very popular. In a forest it is much easier to hide from  journalists and all information reach the media with  considerable delay. It is difficult to say what purpose this is  supposed to serve -- the information reaches the media sooner or  later anyway.    Perhaps it is the spring that makes the politicians seek  refuge from the media outside Warsaw. Last Friday in Jablonna  there was a meeting of the National Council of Radio and  Television and the leadership of the Polish Television  (participating in the meeting was, among other persons, Wieslaw  Walendziak, the Supervisory Board of the Polish Television and  the Board of Directors, the directors of the First and the  Second Program, as well as the heads of the regional sections).  Invited to the meeting was also Government Press Office Head  Dariusz Jadowski and President's Spokesman Andrzej Drzycimski  (the latter did not arrive). The meeting was, needless to say,  closed to the press, even though it was devoted to the  activities of a component of the mass media -- the television.    The government decided to hold a session of the Council of  Ministers in Lansk. The government building is hidden in a  forest near a beautiful lake. It is separated from the nearest  village by kilometers of forests. Behind the doors there are no  crowds of journalists demanding immediate answers to thousands  of inquisitive questions.  <H5>  The Government Point of View </H5>   Freedom of speech and openness of the political life are  undoubtedly cumbersome to the participants of this life. The  openness of the political life is desirable for those who do not  participate in it, and it serves the purpose of calling those  who are governing the country at the moment to account. Those  who are in power do not like to be called to account. They are  not very favorably disposed toward independent press, because it  discusses issues that they would willingly conceal. The  existence of the free press forces the subordinated press to be  objective -- it cannot omit important information because it  would lose its readers. Therefore, subordination of the entire  press is a desired state of affairs for all those who are in  power. Since this state of affairs is not easy to accomplish,  politicians are hiding.    They say that playing politics far from people's eyes is  quite common also in countries with rooted democracies. No one  is surprised by the fact that government spokesmen refuse to  make any comments. Western parliaments are not visited by large  groups of journalists, as is the case in our Sejm.    On the other hand, however, in deeply rooted democracies no  one accuses the press of speculating, being aggressive and  nonobjective, and of pursuing sensational news only, instead of  showing positive models and printing official communiques when  they are issued.</p>

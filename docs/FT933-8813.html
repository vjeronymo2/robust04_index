			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Letter: Where VW was badly advised in GM affair Sir, If the manner in which Messrs Piech and Lopez have been conducting business so far is in any way representative of the way they intend to run the company, the future of Volkswagen looks very bleak indeed. In their handling of the Der Spiegel affair they simply broke the most elementary rules of corporate public relations behaviour. First, they disregarded the basic rule, especially in the automotive industry, never to react in this way to articles in the press. Then they topped it off by asking the courts to order rebuttals to be printed and, even worse, pressed for a gag order. Mr Piech almost unbelievably failed to foresee Der Spiegel's very predictable reaction. It asked and obtained from the court a suspension of the ban and, by doing so, allowed the magazine to present sufficient evidence to prove the substance of their allegations before the courts. For Opel it was an unexpected opportunity that allowed it to submit its case practically on its own terms. It eagerly offered Der Spiegel the assistance of 22 GM and Opel witnesses and four legal experts. All volunteers, as they claim. Although Der Spiegel has a solid reputation for investigative reporting, it is difficult to believe that it did not get any help from Opel when researching the story. It therefore looks very much as if Piech, with both eyes wide open, fell into a trap set by Opel. 'I was badly advised,' Piech later ruefully remarked. An example of very poor managerial judgment from a man who claims to be the only one qualified to save the embattled company. And with the help of a man who increasingly seems to be responsible for this 'fine mess he got Volkswagen in to'.

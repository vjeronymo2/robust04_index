			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / US offers to send troops to Somalia THE US has offered to provide up to 30,000 armed troops to deliver relief supplies to thousands of starving people in Somalia and will use force if necessary, AP reports from Washington. The troops would be part of a proposed multinational force operating under United Nations auspices that would attempt to end the disruption of food supplies by feuding clans in the stricken African nation, officials said. Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, acting secretary of state, made the offer on Wednesday to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general, in response to his plea for more help in a so-far unsuccessful UN relief mission, they added. Mr Boutros Ghali did not decide immediately whether to accept the offer, conditional on other nations also providing troops as part of the operation. 'It was a tentative discussion,' said one official, 'but there was broad agreement in the UN Security Council that things aren't working out.' The troops would help deliver supplies and also provide security, the official said.</p>

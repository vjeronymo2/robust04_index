"Certain member states want to transform the European Union  (EU) into a fish shop," he stated on the BRTN [Dutch-language  Belgian Radio and Television]. According to him, tough words  were expressed within the Council toward these two countries.  "Too much is too much," he said, feeling that the demands made  by these two countries is excessive.    Mr. Claes used the financial argument: "Spain and Portugal  would be well-advised to take account of the fact that Norway  will be a net contributor to the Community budget, with all the  benefits which that implies for the four cohesion countries  (Spain, Portugal, Greece, and Ireland -- editor's note)," he  said.    The Belgian foreign minister added that Oslo had already  taken two steps toward the EU: The first during its accession  to the European Economic Area, the free-trade agreement between  the EC and the EFTA countries (except Switzerland, which voted  against it) which stipulates that the countries receiving  cohesion funds should receive an extra fishing quota of 11,000  tonnes of cod in Norwegian waters, and the second during the  negotiations of recent days, during which "appreciable steps"  have been taken.    Mr. Claes added that, nevertheless, he was still "confident"  about the chances of unravelling this Gordian knot "this very  night."</p>

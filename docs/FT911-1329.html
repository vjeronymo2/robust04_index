			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / International Company News: Norton starts internal inquiry THE PROFITS of a German fasteners company bought by Norton Group, better known for its motorcycle business, have been paid into court because of an ownership dispute. The new management of Norton has launched an internal investigation into both the German company and a US subsidiary called Pro-Fit, a distributor of pipe fittings bought in 1988. Both were acquired as profitable businesses to support the development of the motorcycles and rotary engines. Mr Norman Wilson, a new non-executive director of Norton, said the inquiry was particularly concerned with the Pounds 8.2m German purchase. He described the situation as a mess. Earnings were being paid into court and Norton did not even know what it owned because of the dispute, which was mentioned in the acquisition document. The results of the internal inquiry would be handed over to the Department of Trade and Industry, which launched an investigation into Norton's affairs in January. At that time a poorly supported Pounds 6.5m rights issue, related to the FUS Beteiligungs-und Verwaltungs acquisition, was struggling to a conclusion. Although shareholders approved the FUS purchase in November, some dissidents tried to block it. Part of the controversy was that the vendor of the business was a Channel Islands trust company set up to benefit the offspring of Mr James Tildesley, Norton's chairman, who resigned about 10 days ago. Norton's shares were suspended at 18p on April 1 because of a delay in publishing its results for the six months to October 31. Mr Wilson said Pounds 6m was owed to Midland Bank, which was being co-operative.</p>

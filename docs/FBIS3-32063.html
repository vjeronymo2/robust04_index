			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Address to the nation by President Gonzalo Sanchez de </F> Lozada; place not given -- live or recorded]    [Excerpts] My dear fellow Bolivian citizens: The reason  that moved me to talk to you this evening is that I have good  news to give you -- tomorrow we will submit to Congress a bill  on the government's project to turn state-owned enterprises into  mixed corporations under government control. This bill will  enable us to keep our promise to create 500,000 new jobs for  Bolivians during our administration. I am sure you are well  aware that a privatization drive is under way all over the  world. Even Russia and East European countries are privatizing  their public companies. But Bolivia has chosen another path.  Rather than selling its assets, Bolivia has decided to invite  foreign and domestic capital to invest in our state-owned  enterprises an amount of money that is comparable to the value  of the companies' equity. In other words, instead of having one  YPFB [Bolivian Government Oil Deposits], we will have two YPFBs.  We will incorporate new and needed management techniques and  technology. Principally, the capital inflow will create  investments which will in turn generate new openings and create  new jobs. We are well aware that the biggest problem in Bolivia  is the shortage of openings. This is why we give so much  importance to this bill and consider it of paramount importance  for the future of our country. The remaining part of these  enterprises, which will be owned by the government, will be  apportioned among Bolivians. We will establish between five and  10 pension funds so that each Bolivian may have his own savings  and be covered for his old age. We estimate that this will  happen in 1995. [passage omitted]    We cannot disregard the importance of this bill. You may  wonder why we took so long to draft this bill that only  comprises four chapters and 11 articles. Well, we took our time  because we had to discuss it with foreign and domestic  investors, and with the Bolivian people -- we have conducted  public opinion polls and established task forces to make an  in-depth study of the project. We consulted everyone because it  would be totally worthless to draft a bill that is rejected by  everybody and that yields no results. I ask you to bear this in  mind. [passage omitted]    Foreign and domestic private investors in our state-owned  enterprises will have their profits, their returns, but the  Bolivian people will also stand to gain because all those over  18 will have access to the aforementioned pension funds that  will provide them with a sure pension for their old age.    It is my considered opinion that this bill will be  instrumental in creating new jobs and establishing the first  social security system in South America to provide coverage for  all Bolivians, without exception. I think the new investments  will constitute a driving force to spur domestic growth and  benefit all Bolivians. I think we can double our growth rate to  a pace similar to that of Chile, rather than at our current pace  which only serves to cover our basic necessities while leaving  unemployment unsolved.    We have an agenda. By Carnival Sunday [16 January] -- within  two weeks -- we will have submitted to Congress an educational  reform bill. Thank God, we have been able to reach a consensus  on a basic project. We will draft a bill on this project. This  law will not be controversial because we have discussed it with  all sectors -- the church, teachers, parents -- and we deem it  very important because -- while Bolivia urgently needs new jobs  -- one cannot overlook the need for a better education system.  We can no longer endure the present education standards -- they  are a complete disaster and a disgrace. We want to change our  education system by consensus, we want all Bolivians to become  involved in it so that nobody feels obliged to accept something  against his will. But we must effect this change.    Moreover, we are also studying the popular participation  project. We are not sure if this will be a law or a supreme  decree -- we will seek the people's advice on this issue even if  we are accused of dragging our feet. We take our time because a  sense of responsibility guides all our actions. Our  administration is not arrogant and despotic; we seek other  people's opinions, we discuss things so as to avoid instituting  policies that wreak disaster on the country like in the past.    Finally, we are working on the national budget, which will  have a deficit of only 3 percent, as agreed during our  negotiations with the IMF. We estimate that inflation in 1994  will be 7.5 percent and that the country will grow by 4 percent.  We intend to invest at least $450 million in the public sector.  We are putting together a budget that is based on austerity.  We will implement cutbacks in government spending instead of  increasing taxes. There will be no tax increases. We will  modify the tax system so that it is more productive and less  damaging, but we will not increase taxes.    One thing that I do want to make clear is that it never  crossed our minds -- and it never will -- to freeze savings or  bank accounts. I do not know where this rumor originated, but  it is an evil rumor that is very damaging to our country.  [passage omitted]    I want to state very clearly that as long as I am the  president of the Republic, savings, whether in dollars or  bolivianos, will not be touched. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> November 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'PRO-CHOICE INTENSITY'  </P> <P> Schneider's article on abortion blandly states that the issue is one of faith  versus reason.  </P> <P> I read the article curious to see how one could "reason" to a pro-abortion  stance and explain the scientific facts regarding the life, humanity and early  viability of the fetus as "faith."  </P> <P> My curiosity went unsatisfied; nowhere in the article's 30 paragraphs is there  any such explanation.  </P> <P> Schneider has it backwards as is evidenced by the concentration of pro-abortion  arguments onthe emotional issues of rape and incest when, in fact, 98% of the  1.5 million abortions a year in the United States involve neither.  </P> <P> RICHARD M.

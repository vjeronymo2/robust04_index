			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Tougher legislation on insider dealing planned THE GOVERNMENT is to intro-duce tough legislation against insider dealing, in an attempt to improve its poor prosecutions record against individuals and companies which make huge dealing profits from the use of confidential information. The legislation, to be introduced in parliament next month as part of the Criminal Justice Bill, includes some new offences and closes loopholes in the existing law. For the first time, dealing in gilt-edged stock on the basis of inside information will be banned. According to a Treasury official, inside information in such a case would include advance knowledge of a change in government-controlled interest rates. Advance knowledge of UK trade figures, however, would not be regarded as inside information, because such information is too 'general' under the terms of the act. It will also become illegal for someone with inside information to encourage someone else to deal in shares, even if that other person is not told the information. This is in part aimed at stamping out the 'broker's lunch', a venerable City tradition, during which a director talks freely about his or her company's prospects over a relaxed meal with brokers in the City. If brokers subsequently encourage their clients or market makers to deal in shares of that company, the brokers will be guilty of insider trading - even if they do not pass on to clients or market makers information they have been given by the director. The definition of inside information will also be broadened to cover information which affects a company's share price, even though the information is not about that particular company. The current draft of the new law defines inside information as information 'not only where it is about the company but also where it may affect a company's business prospects'. The Treasury official gave an example: 'If someone discovered that a company had closed down and then sold the shares of that company's competitor, that would be insider trading.' The British Merchant Banking Association is concerned that City firms' traditional way of doing business will be threatened by the new law. It fears that analysts will not be able to talk to any quoted companies - as they do regularly now - without receiving inside information. The Treasury said yesterday that analysts' research will have to be based on publicly available information. It said it had 'bent over backwards' to ensure that analysts would be able to publish research so long as this research was the result of 'diligent digging' into publicly available information. It will also be illegal to deal on the basis of confidential information relating to a 'class of issuers of securities', as well as information relating to an individual issuer. Unpublished information relating to an industry, rather than a single company, will become inside information. The government was obliged to replace the Companies Securities (Insider Dealing) Act so that UK law becomes consistent with a new European directive on insider dealing.</p>

			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Observer: Major vs Marlow The House of Commons experienced a frisson of history when Tony Marlow became the first Tory MP since Leo Amery - 54 years ago - to call in such stark terms in the Commons for the resignation of his own leader and prime minister. Amery, a diminutive figure but much more of a political heavyweight than Marlow, told Neville Chamberlain to go after the failure of the Norwegian campaign in May 1940. Amery quoted Cromwell's declaration to the long parliament: 'You have sat here too long for any good you have been doing. Depart, I say, and let us have done with you. In the name of God, go.' Chamberlain went two days later, and Churchill took over. We spy no Churchills in the wings in 1994.</p>

			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Record number of jobless seek mental help RECORD numbers of unemployed people are being referred by their doctors to clinical psychologists, the British Psychological Society said yesterday. The society said that in calculating the full costs of unemployment it was essential to include the social costs of increased physical and mental ill-health and the added reliance on the National Health Service and welfare systems. Dr Jenny Cozens, a lecturer at Leeds University and a clinical and occupational psychologist, said that there was a two-year waiting list in some areas to see a clinical psychologist. She said there was an 'indisputable link' between unemployment and mental stress. Psychologists in parts of the Midlands were being inundated with requests for help because of the pit closure programmes. Dr Dilys Davies, a clinical psychologist for North East Warwickshire Health Authority, said the emotional impact of job loss on middle class men in areas such as the south-east - worst hit by the recession - could be devastating. She said: 'They internalise it more than working class men and see it as a personal failure. In working class communities where there is a history of unemployment people do not take it as personally.' Nevertheless she said unemployment was worse for poor people because alternative work was more limited. Mr Andrew Stephenson, aged 37, a security consultant who became unemployed last August and a founder of Reaction, a self-help group in Sheffield, said: 'I felt isolated and I did not want to talk to my friends about it when I lost my job. 'There was a lurking fear that because things change so quickly I would be left behind if I did not get a job quickly. One does also deteriorate very quickly if you just sit in front of the television.'</p>

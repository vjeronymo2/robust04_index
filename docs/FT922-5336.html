			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Letter: Reality of industry hidden Sir, May I echo every word of Leon di Marco's letter (May 20) about the government's blindness to the perilous state of Britain's manufacturing industry. But may I warn that we still face a flood of misleading government propaganda in its endeavours to paint a sympathetic picture of manufacturing leading Britain out of recession. At MSF's conference in Bournemouth on May 16, a resolution was passed reaffirming our membership's belief that Britain needs 'a thriving, expanding and competitive manufacturing industry as the key sector of the economy on whose success all else ultimately depends'. We know that a major change is needed in government industrial strategy if this is to happen. To put pressure on the government we need to open up the debate. That cannot be done if the truth about the state of manufacturing is hidden from public view. It is up to papers like the FT diligently to examine the reality of what is happening. On the same day Mr Di Marco's letter was published the current account deficit went over Pounds 1bn again. Yet in the last few months we have had regular statements from ministers (and, indeed, the CBI) telling us that the figures showed encouraging trends in exports and imports. MSF is determined that the near silence about the plight of Britain's manufacturing industry is ended. Our members - in manufacturing and the services - depend on a highly skilled, properly rewarded, scientifically backed industry which can put Britain back into the lead again.

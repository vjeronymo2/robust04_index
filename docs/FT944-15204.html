			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / International Company News: Sun returns to its shining performance of 1980s - Positive trends have helped the US computer company to report record earnings We have hit a home run]' boasts Mr Scott McNealy, chairman and chief executive of Sun Microsystems, after the computer workstation manufacturer surprised Wall Street with record first-quarter sales and earnings. Net income more than doubled to Dollars 38.4m, or 40 cents a share, from Dollars 16.6m, or 16 cents, in the same period last year. Analysts had been projecting earnings of about 26 cents a share. Revenues for the quarter were Dollars 1.273bn, up nearly 33 per cent from Dollars 960.5m. Sun's share price rose Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 32 1/4 yesterday. 'All of our business units met or exceeded our plans,' says Mr McNealy. 'Our desktop computer unit growth was phenomenal. Unit sales more than doubled. Our high-end server, storage arrays and database servers did very well. 'Our technical workstations and graphics workstations did very well . . . You don't achieve these kind of numbers because one product line or one geographic area did well. You have to hit the lot.' First-quarter shipments of workstations and servers jumped nearly 50 per cent from a year ago to 74,000 systems in the quarter, the company said. Shipments would have been higher but for a shortage of D-Ram (dynamic random access memory) chips during the quarter, says Mr McNealy. 'Our backlog is still higher than we would like.' With memory chip shortages easing, Sun expects to reduce its order backlog in the current quarter. Orders booked during the first quarter were Dollars 1.27bn, up 33 per cent from Dollars 942.1m a year earlier. For Sun, the first-quarter results represent a return to the shining performance of previous years. After breaking business growth records in the 1980s, its performance dimmed as growth in the market for computer workstations slowed and competitors, offering more powerful workstations, bit into Sun's market. Sun still holds a commanding lead in the Dollars 10bn workstation market for powerful desktop computers used by engineers, designers and financial analysts. The company, however, is increasingly turning to the broader market for 'enterprise' computing based on networks of desktop computers and servers. 'We want to be known as the world's best supplier of network computing products,' says Mr McNealy. The trend towards computer networking - on a local, company and global scale  -presents big opportunities for Sun, he says, as many businesses move from mainframes to cheaper, more flexible networks of smaller machines. At the same time, departments and branch offices are 'upsizing' PC networks by adding powerful 'servers'. Sun is the 'rightsizing' computer supplier, says Mr McNealy. Sun's Solaris software, a version of Unix, is gaining momentum in the networking market after a rocky start. SunSoft, the company's system software unit, distributed 82,000 Solaris licences during the first quarter, the company said. A version of Solaris designed to run on Intel-based servers is now 'up and running', says Mr McNealy. 'Novell, the leading network software supplier, is vulnerable to competition, he adds. 'Novell is a soft underbelly and everybody is going after their market. We see a real opportunity to do well there.' Another positive trend for Sun is the growth of global networking. 'The Internet is growing like crazy and 56 per cent of the servers on the Internet are from Sun. As the Internet grows, we grow,' says Mr McNealy. He is more cautious, however, about consumer use of high-speed networks. 'A lot of money will be lost on the information highway over the next few years. We'd just rather not lose (money) there.' Sun is also moving to upgrade the performance of its workstations with a new microprocessor chip, called UltraSparc. First samples of the new chip have just arrived. 'You will see faster workstations and servers based on UltraSparc in about a year,' says Mr McNealy.</p>

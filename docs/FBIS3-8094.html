Markiewicz learned of his dismissal at 1345 yesterday [1  March], one hour after a news conference at which he had  publicly signed a document awarding PolSat Television a license  to operate a nationwide television channel. Loss of the  chairmanship of this Broadcasting Council does not mean loss of  membership thereof, and Markiewicz is still a member. His  duties, however, have been taken over by the hitherto deputy  chairman, Maciej Ilowiecki.    Ilowiecki was angry when he heard the news about Markiewicz.  "That just shows how democracy works in this country," he said.  "The president had no right to dismiss the chairman. That can  only be done jointly by the Sejm, the Senate, and the president,  and only if the president rejects a report by the Council or the  chairman breaks the law on broadcasting. Therefore, I await  evidence of such an offense."    Andrzej Drzycimski, the presidential spokesman, said that  the  decision to recall Markiewicz was dictated by the fact that  "Markiewicz had failed to observe the provisions of the law on  radio and television broadcasting." According to Drzycimski,  the Council wanted to grant PolSat a broadcasting monopoly.  "Among the evidence of this is that PolSat was to be awarded a  license to operate a nationwide channel and satellite channels  at the same time, and was to be allocated regional frequencies,"  Drzycimski wrote in a communique.    Drzycimski claims that Markiewicz's plan to merge local  stations into larger networks is also a violation of the  broadcasting law. Drzycimski did not mention PolSat by name but  referred to all of the stations owned by Zygmunt Solorz, owner  of PolSat. The president has already criticized the  Broadcasting Council several times for granting PolSat a  nationwide television license.    Drzycimski's communique also mentions the controversial  issue  of documents on the subject of the companies that were competing  for broadcasting licenses. The State Protection Office [UOP] is  said to have conveyed these documents to Markiewicz before he  made his final choice as to who would be awarded the  broadcasting license. Drzycimski also claimed that Markiewicz  was in the possession of material on the subject of some of the  broadcasting license applicants that "gives reason to believe  that there is a possible danger to state security."    During the news conference, Markiewicz said that the UOP  material contained virtually nothing that could disqualify  Solorz in the eyes of the Broadcasting Council. He said there  was certainly nothing on Solarz in the papers he received from  the prime minister before the final choice was made, and nothing  in the unofficial material he received from a high-ranking UOP  official almost at the very last moment. "This unofficial  material, which was not even signed, contained observations that  discredited four applicants for the broadcasting license, but  Solorz was not one of them. There was some speculation about  Solorz. That is all," said Markiewicz.    In the opinion of UOP spokesman Irena Popoff, from all of  the  documents he had received, Markiewicz could not have known any  more about the applicants than the president and the prime  minister.    According to the prime minister's press secretary, Ewa  Wachowicz, the UOP material supplied to the prime minister did  not question PolSat's eligibility to apply for the broadcasting  license.    Markiewicz admitted that, on the day the license was  awarded,  he had held a bitter conversation with the president. Lech  Walesa had accused him of accepting a bribe from Solarz. "As a  Solidarity member, I find that accusation scandalous," said  Markiewicz.    On Tuesday [1 March], at 1500 hours, the Broadcasting  Council, already informed of Markiewicz's demise, presented, in  the presence of journalists, PolSat representatives with  PolSat's broadcasting license. The license was signed by  Markiewicz and by the Council's deputy chairman, Maciej  Ilowiecki.    Asked to comment on Lech Walesa's negative decision  concerning him, Markiewicz said: "As a member of the  Broadcasting Council, I am not at liberty to comment on  decisions by the head of state. I received news of this  decision at 1345, and I acknowledged it, which does not mean  that I immediately began to study the broadcasting law. The law  says that the president appoints the chairman of the Council but  does not say who dismisses him."    Andrzej Zarebski, secretary to the Council, said that the  Council has resolved unanimously to petition the Supreme Court,  the Constitutional Tribunal, and the Sejm to investigate whether  the president has the right to dismiss the chairman of the  Broadcasting Council. According to Professor Stanislaw Piatek, a  media expert, the broadcasting law fails to define the precise  manner in which the chairman of the Broadcasting Council is  dismissed.</p>

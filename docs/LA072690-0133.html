			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STUBBORN LEAK GROUNDS SHUTTLE ATLANTIS UNTIL FALL  </P> <P> NASA's last-ditch effort to fix an Atlantis hydrogen leak on the launch pad  failed Wednesday and the agency had to postpone the shuttle flight until later  this year.  </P> <P> NASA engineers, who had hoped to avoid a long delay by quickly repairing the  leak while the ship was on the pad, said the shuttle must be returned to the  hangar for more work. It had been scheduled for use in a secret military  mission next month.  </P> <P> The shuttle Columbia, also being repaired since a different kind of hydrogen  leak caused a planned May launch to be scrubbed, will be the next shuttle to  fly. It is scheduled for an astronomy mission in September, and NASA officials  said they expect it to be ready in time.  </P> <P> The developments came as a space agency team began probing NASA's most  publicized problem: the flawed mirror on the $1.5-billion Hubble Space  Telescope.  </P> <P> The team of seven, led by Lew Allen, director of the National Aeronautics and  Space Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, heard testimony in secret at  Hughes Danbury Optical Systems Inc., which made the mirror.  </P> <P> The flaw has halved the effectiveness of the telescope, which was put into  orbit in April.  </P> <P> Experts had hoped that the problem with Atlantis could be solved with simple  launch pad repairs, but the leak reappeared during a test Wednesday and  engineers concluded they still did not fully understand the problem.  </P> <P> "We were not able to fix it. We have learned more, so we will roll back  smarter," William Lenoir, head of NASA's space flight program, said.  </P> <P> NASA will try to launch Atlantis for the classified Pentagon flight in  November.  </P> <P> The latest leak, detected when liquid hydrogen was pumped into Atlantis'  external fuel tank, was about the size of the leak detected in two previous  tests and was in the same area, a flange in a pipe that carries liquid hydrogen  from the tank to the main engines.  </P> <P> Workers tightened bolts around the flange and checked the welds, though  engineers said they doubted that would be enough to correct the problem.  </P> <P> Had the spot held Wednesday, NASA would have tried to launch Atlantis in  mid-August and Columbia in September. Now, officials intend to get Columbia  ready to be moved to the launch pad in early August, shuttle director Robert L.  Crippen said.  </P> <P> NASA officials want to get at least one shuttle up before Discovery's mission  in October with Ulysses, a satellite that will explore the sun's poles.  Discovery has a 19-day "window" in which it must lift off or the mission will  have to be delayed 13 months.  </P></p>

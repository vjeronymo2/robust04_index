			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Soccer clubs may win reprieve for stadium terraces Ministers may drop the requirement for Britain's leading football clubs to have all-seater stadiums by August in a move that could mean a reprieve for terrace culture. They are considering whether to extend this summer's deadline - which in England includes Premiership and First Division clubs - on a case-by-case basis, and whether to combine this with a law change to remove the all-seater requirement. This would be part of a reform of the three acts governing sports grounds, which ministers would like rationalised into one under wider deregulation moves. If the proposed reform makes it on to the 1994-95 legislative timetable, as the Department of National Heritage is understood to have requested, this could mean a permanent reprieve for some terraces - with their tradition of songs and chants and cheaper admission prices. But the department said last night that the fact that the three acts might be rationalised should not lead people to assume the government was necessarily going to change its policy. Although several clubs are struggling to meet the August deadline, such a policy reversal would probably be viewed dimly by those that have already spent heavily to upgrade their grounds. The apparent softening of the government's stance stems from two main factors: A growing feeling that the Taylor report into the 1989 Hillsborough disaster, which led to the all-seater requirement, took an understandably but unnecessarily rigid line. Some 95 fans were crushed to death on the terraces at the Sheffield ground. Improvements in ground safety technology. Mr Iain Sproat, national heritage minister, is understood to have been impressed by a system that monitors pressure around a stadium. Mr Tom Pendry, a Labour national heritage spokesman, recently referred to this system, saying: 'I firmly believe that, in the light of new developments, supporters should be given the opportunity to stand in new, safer areas.' One club which will apply for an extension to the August deadline is Barnsley, according to Mr Michael Spinks, general manager. The club has planning consent for a 4,500-seater stand lifting its seating capacity to more than 14,000, but the earliest this will open is 1995. Rebates for sports clubs, Page 9</p>

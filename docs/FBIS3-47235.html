			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] At 0900 on 10 January, His Excellency [H.E.] Hun  Sen, second prime minister of Cambodia's royal national  government, received H.E. Jacques Chirac, former French prime  minister and mayor of Paris, and his colleagues at the office of  the Council of Ministers.    On this occasion H.E. Hun Sen talked about the current  situation in Cambodia. He asked the French Government to assist  Cambodia in the fields of agriculture, water policy,  communication lines linking cities and rural areas, electricity,  and professional training. H.E. Hun Sen also suggested that  France, cochairman of the Paris international conference on  Cambodia, help push signatory countries to quickly implement  their pledges to provide appropriate aid (?in accordance with)  the territorial integrity and Cambodia's rehabilitation.    Concerning the Khmer Rouge issue, H.E. Hun Sen said that the  stance of the Royal Government of Cambodia [RGC] remains the  same, that is, it is always keeping the door open for the Khmer  Rouge to join in the country's construction as government  advisers or even member of the royal government, if a majority  of the National Assembly agrees by amending the constitution.  He also said that the Khmer Rouge have shown no intention of  being reconciled with the nation and taking part in the  rebuilding of Cambodia. On the contrary, they have intensified  their activities in attacking the Khmer Royal Armed Forces  [KRAF] more vigorously. H.E. Hun Sen stressed that the RGC can  accept the Khmer Rouge only when they properly respect the three  conditions set by His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk, namely, the  cease-fire, the demobilization and inclusion of Khmer Rouge  troops into the KRAF, and the handing over of the territory  being controlled by the Khmer Rouge to the RGC. H.E. Hun Sen  said that if the Khmer Rouge continue to fight and talk at the  same time, the RGC cannot accept this. H.E. Hun Sen also  appealed to the French Government to use its influence to  prevent infiltrations by the Khmer Rouge along the border.    H.E. Jacques Chirac promised to do all he could to continue  providing garbage trucks, help Phnom Penh City to have  sufficient electricity, assist in providing clean water to the  city, and help train Cambodian students who have just finished  their studies.    As for the RGC's request for the French Government to help  build a park along the Tonle Sap River in front of the royal  palace stretching to the base of the Chrouy Changva bridge, H.E.  Jacques Chirac said studies would be conducted with the Phnom  Penh City side first.</p>

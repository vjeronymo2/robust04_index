			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Arts: Today's Television Sift through the nonsense on screen as the holiday looms and you can find the odd serious offering. First Sight (7.30pm BBC2) is a timely look at the drinks trade - from the other side of the law. Booze-running is big business, as America found out during Prohibition; though our Channel-leaping trippers loading up with the product of grape, grain and hop have yet to resort to shoot-outs with the customs officers we see going about their eagle-eyed calling. More divided sympathies, more trouble in store awaiting the day of reckoning in Channel 4's Witness (9pm). Morehouse College, Atlanta, teaches its black students to be proud, confident and ruthless. When these qualities are allied to extremism - any sort of religious fundamentalism or political militancy - it all starts to look alarming. The irony is that the place turns out the rigidly conservative mindset one associates with the wearers of white sheets rather than black skin - yet it produced Martin Luther King and the film director Spike Lee. A disturbing film.</p>

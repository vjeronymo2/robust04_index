			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] The ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy  in Liberia] faction in Liberia, headed by Alhaji Koromah, seems  to be heading for a confrontation with ECOMOG [Economic  Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group]  forces. On Saturday [25 June] the two sides exchanged fire in a  shoot-out in a suburb of Brewerville. ECOMOG say they were  forced to shoot back in self-defense. Then on Sunday, a cache  of weapons was seized from Koromah's house in a joint raid by  ECOMOG and Liberian Defense Ministry forces. ULIMO were  protesting strongly about the raid, and say they have been  singled out unfairly, and today their military spokesman, Kales  Dumbuya, phoned us up from Monrovia to complain. On the line,  Josephine Hazely asked Mr. Dumbuya what they were unhappy about.    [Begin recording] [Dumbuya] The house of the national  chairman is not something hidden; it is not somewhere hidden.  We were rather surprised to see the ECOMOG going there to say  that they are going to search. They once searched the place and  the arms and ammunition that was there they were not hiding.  They were open. The field commander has visited that area  before with those arms there, so we were rather taken aback by  the fact that they had to loot computers and money and other  valuables from the house under the pretext that they have gone  to search for arms.    [Hazely] Why did you have that quantity of arms and  ammunition in the residence of Alhaji Koromah?    [Dumbuya] Those things are fallacies. They took only four  arms from the chairman's residence, four arms with some  ammunition that was to be used for the protection of the  national chairman, a signatory to the Cotonou Accord. We were  not....    [Hazely, interrupting] They say, the ECOMOG says that these  arms were being moved to destabilize Monrovia.    [Dumbuya] Josephine, that is another fallacy. That is  fallacy to the large extent. There is nothing like moving on to  Monrovia. We have kept these arms and ammunition for the  protection of the national chairman. ECOMOG is aware of that.    [Hazely] If you say the arms and the ammunition were for the  protection of your chairman, Alhaji Koromah, how come you had so  many? According to ECOMOG, they said they have seized 26,000  rounds of ammunition along with assault rifles, rocket propelled  grenades and launchers, and communication sets.    [Dumbuya] Josephine, that is another fallacy as I said.  There was a communication set that ECOMOG and everybody was  aware of, because when we want to contact the front we go to  that communication set and contact the front. So it was not  hidden, as I said. The arms and ammunition that was there, they  were overstated. They were overstated to make us look bad.  ECOMOG is aware that arms and ammunition were there in the  chairman's compound. They have gone there. They have seen  armed men holding them -- the two squad [word indistinct]  protecting the national chairman of an organization that is  signatory to the accord here, for Heavens sake. So there is  nothing like having anything under our sleeves to attack  Monrovia. What are we going to attack, to do what?    [Hazely] But you realize also that the house of your  chairman, Alhaji Koromah, was not the only one raided. Also  they went to the home of Roosevelt Johnson.    [Dumbuya] That is another fallacy. There is nothing like  searching Roosevelt Johnson's house, and even if they really  went around there, they gave him enough chance to move his arms  and ammunition. They just gave him chance to move these things  in the barracks, so I mean, don't let them fool you, my sister.  [end recording]</p>

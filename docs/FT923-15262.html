			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Brussels posts Brussels' cyclical game of musical chairs is under way, with the announcement yesterday that Mr Karel Van Miert will take over responsibility for the environment, until Rome names a commissioner to succeed Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, appointed environment minister in Italy's new cabinet, writes David Buchan from Brussels. In 1989, Mr Van Miert ended up with transport and consumer protection, but he may get environment in the next Commission, which would run only for 1993-1994. Most governments are expected to keep their present commissioners. But Mr Ionnis Palaiokrassas, Greek finance minister, will replace Ms Vasso Papandreou, who has run social policy. That dossier may be sought by Mr Jean-Claude Juncker, Luxembourg's finance minister. Sir Leon Brittan is expected to be re-nominated the UK's senior commissioner, though he wants the external affairs job which Mr Frans Andriessen wants to keep.</p>

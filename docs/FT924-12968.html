			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / The UK Economy: Lamont predicts recovery based on low inflation Mr Norman Lamont issued this statement after cutting interest rates: HAVING reviewed with the Bank of England the various indicators of inflationary pressure, I have concluded that a further cut in interest rates of 1 per cent would be fully consistent with the government's inflation objectives as set out in my statement to the Commons' Treasury and Civil Service Select Committee. M0 (the narrow measure of the money supply) is close to the centre of its target range. Although no monitoring range has been set for M4 (the broad measure of the money supply) its annual rate of growth, approaching 5 per cent, is at its lowest level for 20 years. M4 lending is also growing slowly. House prices fell 2.75 per cent last month, bringing the fall over 12 months to 7.5 per cent. Surveys of inflationary expectations point to continuing downward pressure. The producer prices index, excluding food, drink and tobacco, rose by only 2.6 per cent over the past year. There has not been a lower rate of growth since 1969. Recent data and surveys, in this country as in the rest of the world, show that disinflationary forces remain strong and confidence weak. The exchange rate has fluctuated around a level which, in current conditions, does not pose a significant threat to the government's inflation objectives in the short term. These indicators, on top of the progress we have made in curbing inflation, provide a firm basis for a sustainable reduction in UK interest rates. This will be welcome to millions of families up and down the country with mortgages; and to British business, which now has the lowest official interest rates in the European Community and a highly competitive exchange rate. We have now had a substantial, but justified, easing of monetary conditions since sterling's membership of the exchange rate mechanism was suspended. Provided cost and price inflation are kept firmly under control, British industry can look forward with confidence to a pick-up in domestic and overseas sales. Over the weeks ahead the government will be consulting closely with industry; and I shall set out the prospects for the British economy, together with the government's expenditure plans, in the Autumn Statement next month. A recovery based on low inflation is the only path to the secure jobs and rising prosperity we all want to see. I am not prepared to place that prospect in jeopardy by taking any risks with inflation and will be ready to tighten policy if our inflation objective should be threatened further ahead.</p>

			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / International Company News: Bramalea threat of liquidation BRAMALEA, one of two real estate developers controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family, has warned that it faces liquidation unless a group of recalcitrant debenture holders agrees to support a debt-restructuring plan, writes Bernard Simon in Toronto. Mr Marvin Marshall, Bramalea's chief executive, said European individual holders whom the company met in London this week were supportive of the plan. The plan aims to cut Bramalea's debt from CDollars 4.9bn to about CDollars 2bn (USDollars 1.6bn) over five years through asset sales and concessions from lenders.</p>

			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie unable to hold above 2,500 AN ATTEMPT by the UK equity market to extend the recovery of the previous session faded away yesterday as investors grew increasingly nervous ahead of this morning's meeting of the Bundesbank's policy-making council. Firmness in the D-Mark emphasised fears that the German central bank might tighten policy today, and cast deeper clouds over prospects for UK interest rates. Blue chip share prices opened strongly, as an initial gain in the September futures contract on the FT-SE Index buttressed hopes for an extension of the recovery seen at the close of the previous session. The Footsie quickly advanced by 17.1, managing once again to move above the 2,500 mark, which has proved an elusive target recently. It was soon clear, however, that institutional buying support was sadly lacking and, as the premium on the Footsie contract faded away, so did the gain on the underlying index. Although the market held in positive territory for the rest of the day, there was little genuine support. A sluggish start on Wall Street, which was 5.68 Dow points off in UK hours, left London to close in lifeless trading. The FT-SE Index ended just a net 2.4 up at 2,486.4. Seaq volume remained low, with the 404m-share total swollen by the completion of Tuesday afterover of 374.1m on Tuesday represented customer, or retail, business of only Pounds 854.3m, still a dismal figure from the point of view of the London-based securities industry. The lack of investment interest was reflected in the expectedly poor start for Anglian Group, which opened at a discount to the share offer price after a poor response to the public offer. Tomorrow brings the start of dealings in MFI Furniture, which had a similarly unsuccessful journey through the public sale process. Shares in Wellcome edged higher as the London market awaited the close of the share offer period at the end of next week. Traders said the market had been virtually put 'on hold' until the outcome of today's meeting at the Bundesbank is known. Reiterated political support for Britain's place in the European exchange rate mechanism left the City of London to wait nervously for any decision on German monetary disciplines. Two small trading programmes were identified yesterday, but such was the lack of enthusiasm in the market that the overall trend of share prices was not affected. The banking sector continued to find some support, with the exception of TSB, which gave ground as hopes for a bid receded. A few very small, scattered gains among the store shares reflected little more than a technical rally in a badly battered area of the stock market. In its latest analysis of the UK economy, Goldman Sachs commented that 'there is now mounting evidence that the Conservatives' election victory has not proved to be the catalyst required to shake consumers out of their torpor. This is bad news for the manufacturing recovery which started in February.'</p>

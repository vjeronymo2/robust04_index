			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Mahathir's Asia line delights Japanese: Malaysia's prime minister calls for Asia to say No to the west and tells Tokyo to stop apologising for wartime atrocities Dr Mahathir Mohamad is enjoying unprecedented media exposure in Japan. During recent weeks, the Malaysian prime minister has appeared on Japanese national television and in mainstream dailies; his face covers popular weekly magazines and his name decorates books on the shelves of Tokyo's big bookshops. The spotlight on Mr Mahathir has helped sales of his new book, An Asia that can Say No: A Card against the West. It is co-authored with Mr Shintaro Ishihara, the popular rightist politician and author of a controversial best-seller, A Japan That Can Say No, in which he claimed America's prejudice towards 'yellow people' was behind the US-Japan trade friction and called for Japan to stand up against US demands. The new publication rejects increasing western economic and political influences in Asia and maintains that Asian nations, which share the same values, are distinct from the US and Europe. The Apec meetings in Indonesia have raised interest in the region and the premier among the Japanese public, along with Dr Mahathir's recent comments endorsing Japan's bid for the UN Securities Council seat. Moreover, his disapproval of Japan's unceasing apologies over the atrocities during the second world war has also been applauded by Japanese bureaucrats and politicians. Others have latched on to the media's Mahathir drive. Mr Kenichi Ohmae, the management guru and former head of business consultants McKinsey in Japan, has published a book on Dr Mahathir, and a biography has also hit the shops. At a time when Japan the country is groping for a bigger political and economic role in Asia, many Japanese have embraced the outspoken Dr Mahathir as a representative of the region who is allowing Japan to break from its past. Dr Mahathir's message is plain enough. He wants Japan to play a leading role in Asia, and stand up for the region in the international arena - in the Group of Seven industrialised nations meetings and the United Nations. Aside from his anti-western laments, he also lists grievances about Japan's relations with Asia. He criticises Japan for closing its markets to Asian imports and for the lack of technology transfers. His foremost criticism is Japan's indecisiveness towards forming an East Asian Economic Caucus, a regional economic bloc. The plan groups together Asean and north-east Asian countries including Japan and China, but excludes US, Canada and Australia. Dr Mahathir believes Apec should be a loose grouping mainly concerned with helping development of Asia-Pacific's weaker countries but that it has been taken over by the US, which already has its own regional trade bloc, Nafta. He says small Asian countries need the caucus to counter 'closed' regional trade blocs like the EU and Nafta and to raise their profiles in the global arena. The caucus scheme has angered the US, and Japanese government officials and business groups have been non-committal towards Dr Mahathir's plan, not wanting to upset the US. Mr Mahathir acknowledges Japan's deep 'affinity' with the US, and acknowledges that the US has helped Japan achieve its economic success. However, he says Japan needs to re-evaluate such relations. 'The EAEC will take off as long as Japan takes charge,' he says. Mr Mahathir's criticism has pointed out a growing dilemma in the Japanese government. On the one hand many officials and business executives are cautiously seeking a gradual shift in Japan's foreign and trade policy from the US towards Asia. Such a trend is already apparent in economic relations. The strong yen has prompted industries to move manufacturing operations to Asia, boosting investments, while the increasing economic affluence of the region has made it the largest export destination for Japan. Last year, Japan's trade surplus with the region surpassed its surplus with the US for the first time. Ten years ago, Japan exported a third more to the US than to Asia - now the balance is the other way. On the other hand, the US remains the central pillar in foreign and trade policy. Some Japanese officials camp argue that the country's economic stability cannot be maintained without strong economic ties with the US, and that the international community will not accept a security policy independent from America's. In a recent magazine interview, Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the back-room strategist of Japanese politics, also questioned Japan's budding allegiance with Asia. Where would Japan be without the US, and will Asian countries trust a Japan without America's backing, he asked. So far, Japan has yet to resolve the debate over whether it is a part of the east or west - an issue which has raged for over a century. However, the economic and political links with the region are becoming too deep to ignore.</p>

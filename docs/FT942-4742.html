			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / US insurer to revive A&amp;A with Dollars 200m injection Alexander &amp; Alexander, the US insurance broker, is to get a Dollars 200m capital injection from the country's biggest property/casualty insurer, American International Group, as part of a plan to revive its ailing finances. The deal will leave AIG with preferred stock convertible into 21 per cent of A&amp;A's shares. The broker also slashed its dividend from 25 cents to just 2.5 cents to help preserve its depleted capital. A&amp;A also announced late yesterday that Mr Frank Zarb, formerly a vice-chairman at financial services group Travelers, had been appointed chairman, chief executive and president. Mr Zarb ran Travelers' securities broker, Smith Barney, for five years, turning it around from losses into one of the most profitable retail brokers in the US. Since then he has run its Primerica Financial Services arm and asset management companies. A&amp;A has suffered from legal settlements, depressed conditions in the property/casualty insurance market and a failure to cut costs. Its former chairman and chief executive, Mr Tinsley Irvin, was removed in January. Both AIG and A&amp;A denied that the deal would undermine the broker's independence. Under an eight-year standstill agreement, AIG cannot take a voting stake of more than 9.9 per cent in the company. Prudential, the US insurer, already owns 9.9 per cent of the common stock. A&amp;A, which in the 1980s bought the Canadian firm Reed Stenhouse, as well as Sphere Drake and Alexander Howden in the UK, is the second biggest broker in the world after Marsh &amp; McLennan. It suffered fraud-related losses at Alexander Howden, and in 1992 announced a Dollars 145m after-tax charge to cover asbestos and environmental liabilities taken on with Sphere Drake. Part of the Dollars 200m from AIG will be used to buy reinsurance to cover the Sphere Drake losses, the broker said. Its assessment of the scale of these losses has not changed since 1992. AIG will receive an 8 per cent dividend on its convertible preference stock, payable in the form of additional securities. The stock is convertible into common shares at Dollars 17 a share - a rate fixed during discussions between the two companies on May 13, when the share price slumped towards Dollars 14. Yesterday the shares rose Dollars 1 3/8 to close at Dollars 17 3/4.</p>

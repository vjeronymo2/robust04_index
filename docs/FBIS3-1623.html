First paragraph is  editor's note]    [Text] Editor's note: With the development of social  productive forces, new conflicts and problems in rural areas  constantly arise. On the one hand, hundreds of millions of  peasants have successfully created a lot of fresh experiences so  that these conflicts can be settled. But on the other hand,  real help given by government departments is also badly needed  to settle these new conflicts and problems. Over the past few  years the Central Party Committee and the State Council worked  out many new policies on the basis of practical experience  achieved by hundreds of millions of peasants so as to guide the  ever-deepening rural reform and to make constant progress in  developing the rural economy. However, it is not easy to  implement these policies because it is necessary for various  localities to further refine them, to work out concrete methods  for implementation in line with local conditions, and to do a  lot of work for implementation. This article reflects such a  situation, and comrades engaging in rural work are advised to  read it. The central authorities have formulated a policy of  principle on the issue of transferring contracted farmland, but  obviously, various localities must do a lot of painstaking work  on its implementation.    Zheng Guomin is a peasant from Wanghuangdi village in  Gushanzi Town, Tiefa City, Liaoning Province. Over the past  five years, he consistently cultivated over 100 mu of farmland  and was considered a leading grain-grower in his village, and  his living standard was counted as relatively comfortable. A  few days ago this writer went to his home for investigation and  recorded the conversation with him so that comrades being  enthusiastic in rural work can think about it.    [Che Shujue] I have heard that you are a leading  grain-grower of this village. How much land do you cultivate?  How about the benefit?    [Zheng Guomin] Over the past few years, I cultivated 130 mu  of farmland every year. There are two other households which  are similar to mine. I have 36 mu of self-responsible farmland  [zi jia ze ren tian 5261 1367 6307 0177 3944], 36 mu of farmland  allotted by the village, 51 mu of contracted farmland  transferred from five households, and seven mu of wasteland.  These plots of land are basically for raising wheat and corn,  the average per mu yield is 650 kg -- which is a high yield in  this village -- and the net per mu income is over 100 yuan.  Last year I built this two-story house and spent more than  50,000 yuan, which was all earned by farming.    [Che] Which households transferred their contracted farmland  to you? How did they transfer it?    [Zheng] Some of the five households are working in coal  mines (the Xiaonan Coal Mine is near here), some are doing  business, and others are school teachers and correspondents in  towns. Regarding the method of transferring contracted land, I  contract it and bargain for the price once a year. I give  approximately 75 to 100 kg of grain per mu, whereas I bear all  the expenses on the land.    [Che] How many workers and animals does your family have?    [Zheng] My family has five members and two are engaged in  farm work. I am now 55 years' old and I have an 18-year-old  daughter, and we are the ones who work on the farmland. I have  three horses and a cart. I hire casual laborers in the busy  season. It is not a problem to work on these plots of farmland.    [Che] Do you apply manure or chemical fertilizer to your  farmland?    [Zheng] I mainly rely on chemical fertilizer. Chemical  fertilizer is too expensive and prices are soaring, but I still  have to use it. I do not have enough manure to use, so I can  only apply manure to my self-responsible farmland, but I cannot  use it in contracted land transferred from others. Moreover, I  only contract land from others once a year. I do not know whose  farmland I will contract next year.    [Che] How many people in your village go to other places for  work? How about their income? How do they cultivate their  farmland?    [Zheng] As far as male laborers of our village are  concerned, over 200 of them go to work in coal mines throughout  the year, and each earns 300 to 400 yuan a month. Since most of  them do not give up their farmland, their wives and children at  home are engaged in farming. The yields are not high but merely  for their daily consumption. They also want to transfer their  contracted farmland to others, but they feel that the return of  75 kg of grain per mu is still not good enough. Moreover, a  more important reason is that they worry that the transfer of  contracted farmland in private will not last long. They want to  transfer their contracted farmland to others for a longer  period, but they worry that people like me, who take over the  contracted farmland, will not always do so. I also think of  contracting their farmland for a longer period, but I do not do  so for fear of policy changes from this year to that year. Hey!  We fear this or that, just like "using a hemp stalk to hit a  wolf."    [Che] According to your capability and the situation of your  village, can you still contract more farmland?    [Zheng] Sure I can! There is a lot of farmland which I can  contract, but as I have already said, I worry about policy  changes. Actually, the more farmland I can cultivate, the more  it pays. Let me figure it. If I cultivate 50 mu of farmland, I  cannot earn much after deducting the cost, expenses, and human  and animal feeds. But if I cultivate more than 50 mu, the more  I cultivate, the more it pays. I have said before that I can  earn 100 yuan per mu in farming, but this is the case only if I  cultivate 50 mu of farmland, which means that the net profit of  working on a mu will exceed 100 yuan if I cultivate more  farmland. This year, if grain prices soar again, I think it  will pay more in the days to come if more farmland is cultivated.    [Che] As you have only a cart, is it possible to cultivate  more land?    [Zheng] A cart certainly will not work. I must buy a  tractor if I have 200 to 300 mu of land to cultivate. If this  was a common practice long ago, I would have bought a tractor  first rather than building this small house. Even if no one  drives the tractor, I will let my daughter try it.</p>

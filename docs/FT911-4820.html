			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / International Company News: Kroger returns to the black with Dollars 5.4m net KROGER, the large US retail grocery chain which took on a hefty debt load when it conducted a defensive restructuring in 1988, yesterday reported first-quarter earnings of Dollars 5.36m after tax. This compares with a Dollars 10.3m deficit in the same period a year earlier. The figure was scored on sales up by 7.6 per cent at Dollars 4.91bn, with like-for-like sales rising by 5 per cent. Profits before interest, tax and depreciation, rose by 11 per cent to Dollars 212.7m. The net figure, however, is struck after interest charges of Dollars 125.2m, and an extraordinary charge of Dollars 5.43m - the latter relating to the early retirement of group debt. In the previous year, interest charges were almost 6 per cent higher at Dollars 132.9m, but there were no extraordinary charges. Kroger's chairman, Mr Joseph Pichler, said that the decline in financing costs was partly due to a lower total debt load, and to moves taken to restructure the debt so that its cost was reduced. Kroger geared itself up when it undertook a large restructuring - involving the payment of a sizeable one-off dividend to shareholders - designed to see off two unwanted takeover bids. Mr Pichler added that the sales growth had been spread over the group's retail operations, which range from supermarkets to convenience stores. Particularly strong performances came from own-label and speciality goods, such as delicatessen, floral and pharmacy products.</p>

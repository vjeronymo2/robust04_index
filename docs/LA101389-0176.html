			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> POPE ATTACKS BIRTH CONTROL IN INDONESIA ON LAST DAY OF VISIT  </P> <P> John Paul II today attacked birth control in Indonesia, a Third World pioneer  in restricting population growth.  </P> <P> In a speech on the last day of his five-day visit to predominantly Muslim  Indonesia, he told Catholic bishops: "You are sometimes painfully aware that  certain traditional practices and other contemporary social influences bring  about an obscuring of fundamental principles regarding family life and the  responsible transmission of life." Vatican officials confirmed that this was a  reference to birth control as well as polygamy and the subordinate position of  women.  </P> <P> Aggressive promotion of birth control has been official policy since 1970 in  Indonesia, the world's fifth most populous country. President Suharto this year  received the first U.N. award for population growth control.  </P></p>

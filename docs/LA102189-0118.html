			<p><P> October 21, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ALEMANY PUTS CRESPI TURNOVERS TO GOOD USE IN 28-21 WIN  </P> <P> The inability to cling to the football has left Crespi High grasping -- and  gasping -- for its life.  </P> <P> The Celts fumbled four times and Alemany converted two of the turnovers into 14  points en route to a 28-21 Del Rey League upset on Friday night at Alemany.  </P> <P> The loss dropped the Celts to 4-3 overall, 0-2 in league play.  </P> <P> "We just can't afford to turn the ball over like this every week and expect to  win ballgames," Crespi Coach Tim Lins said. "The way we're playing right now,  we'd be lucky to slip in (to the playoffs)."  </P> <P> The Indians, on the other hand, are in fine shape.  </P> <P> "This was a massive win," Alemany Coach Pat Blackburn said. "This is the finest  win I've ever had as a coach."  </P> <P> And he can thank quarterback Joey Rosselli and tailback Terry Barnum.  </P> <P> The tandem starred in the first half as Alemany (4-3, 1-0) built a 21-7  halftime lead.  </P> <P> Any thoughts of a Crespi rout similar to the 49-0 victory of last season were  quickly put to rest.  </P> <P> Rosselli connected with Frank Winton for a 52-yard touchdown on the fifth play  of the game, and Alemany was off and running.  </P> <P> Rosselli finished 10 of 18 for 189 yards and three touchdowns. And when he  wasn't passing, Barnum was finding the end zone.  </P> <P> Barnum, a sophomore, caught a 49-yard touchdown pass from Rosselli in the first  quarter, then added a 78-yard scoring run after a Crespi fumble in the second  quarter. Barnum darted for 135 yards in 19 carries.  </P> <P> Leonice Brown, who gained 148 yards in 21 carries for Crespi, also fumbled  twice. Three times, including Brown's miscue that set up Barnum's run, the  Celts turned the ball over in Indian territory.  </P> <P> Brown scored on a 30-yard run to tie the score, 7-7.  </P> <P> The Celts took the second-half kickoff and ate up more than seven minutes  before quarterback Bill Canalez connected with tight end Christian Fauria for a  three-yard touchdown.  </P> <P> However, a Canalez fumble late in the third quarter cost the Celts dearly.  </P> <P> Rosselli converted it into an 18-yard touchdown pass to Scott Goldsmith.  </P> <P> Another Canalez-to-Fauria touchdown pass made it interesting, but it wasn't  enough.  </P> <P> The Indians' big-play capability was evident throughout the first half. Alemany  gained 230 yards before intermission, and 179 of them came on scoring plays.  </P> <P> Rosselli had 115 yards passing after his third attempt.  </P></p>

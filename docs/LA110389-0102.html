			<p><P> November 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'LIFE GOES ON' FOR SUDDENLY JOBLESS WORKERS;  </P> <P> EMPLOYMENT: HERALD STAFFERS ARE ALREADY PICKING UP THE PIECES AND GETTING ON  WITH THEIR CAREERS. FOR MOST, THIS MEANS STARTING A JOB SEARCH.  </P> <P> Herald Examiner account executive Kevin Mallett wasted little time.  </P> <P> Thursday morning found the 30-year-old newspaper executive filling out a job  application at a competing paper the day after the Herald announced it would  close forever.  </P> <P> "Life goes on," said Mallett, who had been with the Herald seven months. "I  have a wife, two kids and a mortgage. You have to lick your wounds. Then you've  just got to get up and get going."  </P> <P> After an evening of emotional get-togethers at local bars and restaurants, many  of the Herald's roughly 750 employees had already taken some steps Thursday to  find new jobs and begin new lives.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a trio of Los Angeles investors whose bid for the Herald Examiner  was rejected Thursday said they will make a new offer that includes more cash,  according to United Press International.  </P> <P> Attorney Richard R. Hopkins told the news service that the investment group,  which includes entrepreneur Peter A. O'Neil and former Herald controller John  Reid, wanted to convert the paper to a tabloid, rename it the Los Angeles Post  and rehire most of the staff.  </P> <P> The offer apparently had no impact on plans to shut down the Herald for good.  The Herald's owner, Hearst Corp., said employees will continue to receive  paychecks and health benefits for the next 60 days, and a firm will be hired to  help employees find news jobs elsewhere.  </P> <P> Employees dropped by the Herald's downtown Los Angeles office Thursday to  collect their belongings, visit with colleagues, gather job tips and pick up  plans for a wake this Sunday evening at the Los Angeles Press Club.  </P> <P> But many were still shaking their heads in disbelief.  </P> <P> "I've been sort of numb since all of this started," said David Limrite, 31,  feature section art director. "I haven't had time to deal with it. The first  day I don't walk in here will be when it really hits."  </P> <P> If some employees weren't ready to start looking for jobs, several companies  had already launched recruitment efforts aimed at Herald workers. Reporters and  editors said newspapers from across the nation had begun calling up prospects,  and faxed job notices had been posted on bulletin boards.  </P> <P> Recruiters from the Orange County Register occupied a room in a downtown hotel  to interview applicants, and other newspapers were reportedly flying in their  headhunters. The Times has already hired a few Herald staff writers, who began  work immediately.  </P> <P> On the sidewalks around the Herald's offices, officials from financial and  insurance firms were handing out flyers. "I came down here to get the last  issue, and while I was here I thought I might as well headhunt," said Dick  Compton, an insurance and financial sales executive.  </P> <P> Several Herald employees said they believed that the paper's demise was  inevitable and had begun searching for new jobs long ago.  </P> <P> "I'm in the process of interviewing for another job," said entertainment  listing editor Barak Zimmerman. "If anybody didn't see it coming, they were  playing ostrich."  </P> <P> But many Herald employees were in no rush to find jobs -- yet.  </P> <P> "It will be tight for a while," said television and film writer Nancy Randle,  but "it's been five intense years and I need a little breathing space."  </P></p>

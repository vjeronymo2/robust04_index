			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / UK dominant in European PCs THE UK and Ireland continued to dominate European personal computer manufacturing last year and are now responsible for three out of every five PCs built in Europe, according to Dataquest, the market research group. Total PC sales last year exceeded 8.3m, worth Dollars 28bn (Pounds 15.8bn). In its latest report, Dataquest estimates that of 5.4m PCs made in Europe last year 4.2m were built by companies which bought semiconductors from overseas for European PC production, and that 57 per cent of this production took place in the UK and Ireland. Including 'screwdriver' assembly, the UK alone represents nearly two-thirds of total European PC manufacturing, led by companies such as Acorn in Cambridge, IBM in Greenock, Research Machines in Oxford and Victor in High Wycombe. Italy is the largest volume manufacturer after the UK and Ireland, closely followed by France and Germany. In spite of declining margins both Olivetti and Apple also show strong growth in local production. Other volume assembly plants that are emerging include Compaq, Elonex and Goldstar in the UK and Vobis in Germany. Dataquest forecasts that between last year and 1995 European PC manufacturing will grow in line with the end-user PC market at a compound growth rate of more than 11 per cent. Other trends which are identified in the report include the growing role played by 'no-name' companies in the European industry which account for 25 per cent of all PC production in Europe - equivalent to IBM's production - the continuing move towards more powerful PCs, shorter product life cycles and a further blurring of the differences between high-end desktop PCs and UNIX workstations. Dataquest also predicts that software developments will fuel PC memory chip demand. Mr Mike Williams, a Dataquest semiconductor research analyst, said '1991 was clearly a tough year for personal computer dealerships in Europe. However semiconductor memory chip sales soared by 32.5 per cent compared with an overall unit PC market growth of 12 per cent'. This growth in memory chip sales reflects the move towards memory-hungry software and aggressive marketing tactics by PC suppliers. European PC Manufacturing and Semiconductor Demand.

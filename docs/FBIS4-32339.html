			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["F.B." interview with Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic; </F> place and date not given: "But for Us War Continues"]    [Text] [L'ESPRESSO] Mr. President, can we talk in terms of  normality in Sarajevo now?    [Izetbegovic] Definitely not. It will take a long time yet  before we can talk in terms of a normalization. I do not yet see  any solution to the problems of the city and of Bosnia. And I am  afraid that the issues concerning Sarajevo will be resolved  last. Let us not forget that it is still a city under siege.    [L'ESPRESSO] You do not seem to have much confidence in the  negotiations.    [Izetbegovic] I am sure that the negotiations, like those in  Geneva, are useful. But it is a zigzag process. Ultimately we  will reach a solution. Of the only two possible solutions --  peace or war -- only one is feasible. But I do not believe in  the short term, because the negotiations are very unpleasant.    [L'ESPRESSO] Let us return to Sarajevo. There is a great  deal of unrest. First, the problem was survival. Now, it is  how to make a living: There is no work...    [Izetbegovic] Yes, work is the main problem. We are in the  position of someone who is seriously ill; as long as he is ill,  he has only one problem -- how to recover. But once he has  recovered, he realizes that he has innumerable probes. Now, for  instance, the markets are full of goods, but there is not yet  the money needed to buy them. The situation will return to  normal only when production has been set back in motion.    [L'ESPRESSO] But why is an attempt not made to make this  process quicker?    [Izetbegovic] It is impossible. The most complex problem  facing the world now is in fact Bosnia. And the most  complicated problem in Bosnia is Sarajevo. Nobody now knows the  solution. Look at the map. We are here. Around us there are  the Serbs. And we in turn surround the Serbs who surround  Sarajevo. Everyone is surrounded. So how is it possible to  predict how it will end? There has been talk about a  protectorate of Bosnia on the part of the world community: I  leave people to talk. But any solution that Europe were to  choose would be a non-solution.    [L'ESPRESSO] You say that the embargo on Bosnia should be  lifted. Will you succeed in this?    [Izetbegovic] No, I do not think it is possible. But we have  a duty to demand it. We could achieve another result -- that of  depriving the Serbs of their heavy weapons. Let us remember  that peace will only be possible if there is a balance of  forces. This war, like all wars, is the result of an imbalance  of armaments. In any case, the international community's  response is significant -- when it says that more weapons means  more bloodshed. So it should work to take the weapons -- heavy  weapons, at least -- away from those who have them.    [L'ESPRESSO] Are you not aware that people are very tired of  this war? Even the soldiers of the Muslim army?    [Izetbegovic] I think that this tiredness exists mainly on  the Serbian side. We want peace, but we can continue the war.  There is no tiredness among our soldiers, because our morale is  different from theirs. We are the victims, and soldiers  defending their own land always have a higher level of morale  than the aggressors. The Serbs had 100 times more equipment and  weapons than us. And still they failed to enter even Mostar or  Tuzla.    [L'ESPRESSO] Let me ask you to assign some grades. Which  countries do you consider Bosnia's best friends? And who is at  the bottom of the list?    [Izetbegovic] The Muslim countries are in first place, then  Germany, Italy, Belgium. At the bottom? France and Britain.</p>

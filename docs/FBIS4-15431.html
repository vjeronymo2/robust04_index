			<p>BFN     [Text] Riga, Apr 07, BNS -- President Boris Yeltsin's  April 5 decision clearly reflects the aggressive intentions of  Russia's foreign policy to keep Latvia in its sphere of  influence, the Latvian Saeima (parliament) Homeland and Freedom  faction said.    The reference by Ambassador Aleksandr Rannikh to a technical  mistake is curious from the point of view of international  relations and only indicates of various understanding of  political tactics by various Russian leaders, said faction head  Maris Grinblats. It's not enough to consider that Russia has  given up its aggressive plans.    Grinblats characterized the anticipated signature of the  agreement on the Skrunda radar functioning and the status of  military retirees in Latvia as a "political suicide."</p>

			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Information highway comes to a crossroads: Paul Cheeseright catches up on a Herefordshire experiment in local computing An experiment in stimulating rural economic development by providing a community with a package of the latest computer and communications technology has reached a crossroads. In the next two weeks, sponsors and local interests running the scheme at Kington, Herefordshire, will decide the extent to which the project should become a moneymaking exercise and the extent to which it will meet, often unorganised, community demands. What is clear is the idea that simply installing more than Pounds 250,000 of electronic equipment in the community would itself stimulate rapid economic development has been disproved. Decisions over the future of Kington Connected Community Company (KC3), the company set up to run the project, will be reached after an intricate diplomatic minuet as the financial sponsors seek to induce KC3 to take the decisions they would like, without appearing to dictate events. There is nothing more difficult to deal with than a partnership, sighed one sponsor. Discussion will be around a new business plan worked out for KC3 by Morton Hodson, the Worcester consultants, and financed by the Rural Development Commission, one of the main national sponsors. Local sponsors include Leominster District Council, which provided KC3 with a building, and Hereford and Worcestershire Training and Enterprise Council. The main technical support has come from Apple, which through Rothwell, its agents, provided 34 computers, and BT, which has fitted Kington into its ISDN system, giving it state-of-the-art communications. Mr Russell Brady, Apple's corporate relations officer, said Apple was 'reasonably happy' so far. He went to the heart of what sponsors see as the Kington problem. 'What is required from Kington is to get some projects management skills into the community,' he said. 'Management skills have to be put on top of the enthusiasm and that is up to the community to work out.' The Morton Hodson recommendations for Kington are not yet known but their general drift is fairly clear. They will seek to reconcile, in a business plan, commercial need and community duty. 'There's got to be a balance,' said Mr Gerald Harris, a Morton Hodson partner. 'But it's got to work in financial terms.' The business plan should have been ready last April, but the task was more complicated than expected. Not only that - Morton Hodson was drawn into immediate management problems at KC3, he said. The problem is that KC3 has a lot of gear but no money. At the moment it does not earn enough to pay staff. 'There are too many machines and not enough bodies to drive them,' said Mr Phil Pattington, director of technical services at Rothwell. The orthodox approach to regeneration projects is to put the first 85 per cent of resources into people and cash, and 15 per cent into gear. At Kington, it has been the other way round. There are lots of ideas about using the computers, but not necessarily ideas which produce revenue to keep the operation going. The challenge is both to produce revenue and to keep faith with the local community. The original brief, recalled Mr Miles Swinburne, the KC3 project manager, was 50-50 community-commercial activity. 'If you start using too much (of the equipment) on the commercial side, people on the community side cry 'foul',' he said. It is a sign of the pressures for change already working on KC3 that Mr Swinburne now spends his time working up outside projects - employment and tourist information databases for example - and that a new manager has been recruited to run the KC3 telecentre in the town centre. 'We tried the completely neutral approach of saying 'here we are, what do you want to do?' But it wasn't focused enough,' Mr Swinburne said. 'We're having to be more proactive, suggesting things beforehand, rather than later.'</p>

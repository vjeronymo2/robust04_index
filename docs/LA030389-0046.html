			<p><P> March 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> STRONG CAST, BUT LITTLE WARMTH IN 'OUT COLD'  </P> <P> To watch nifty actors try to breathe a little life into torpid, tacky material  is bad enough. When, in the case of "Out Cold" (selected theaters), the talents  squandered are those of John Lithgow, Teri Garr and Randy Quaid, it feels like  a criminal offense.  </P> <P> "Out Cold" clearly sees itself as black comedy of the "Blood Simple" vein, when  it's really only misfired situation comedy with a little dirt under its  fingernails. From the stylishness of the titles comes a note of hope that this  may be something promising -- a photo collage it's telling us that Garr,  Lithgow and his buddy, Bruce McGill, have been pals since high school, through  the Army and back into civilian life; that Garr and McGill have married and  that the men have opened a modest butcher shop together.  </P> <P> Alas, that's it for the charm. Picking them up a decade or more later, Lithgow  is a wimp, McGill a bully and Garr a ditzy version of a James M. Cain dangerous  dame. When McGill slaps her around, Garr hires Quaid, the lowest rent detective  on the San Pedro docks, to document her husband's philandering. The inept Quaid  gets something more; photos of what he thinks is a liaison, but is actually  evidence of a murder, involving Lithgow, Garr and McGill, only one of them  innocently.  </P> <P> A lot of the humor in the George Malko, Leonard Glasser script comes from the  appearance and disappearance of the corpse, frozen -- in the butcher shop  locker -- into a sort of permanent Highland fling. It's about this time you  realize that this enterprise (rated R for language and grisly situations) has  not a single character to care about. And also that, thanks to Malcolm  Mowbray's flaccid direction, the corpse isn't the only one around to seem  trapped forever.  </P> <P> Ah, but audiences can be out, in the twinkling of an eye, an escape you might  devoutly wish for this cast. Incidentally, this is the second film to mix Quaid  and raw meat of very dubious origin. If this is a trend, it should be nipped in  the bud, now.  </P></p>

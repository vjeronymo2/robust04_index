			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest, May 6, RIA -- Foreign police officers  will assist their Russian colleagues in combating the  illegitimate transfer of capital from Russia to European  countries.    According to Yuriy Melnikov, chief of the Interpol National  Central Bureau in Russia, an understanding on this score was  reached in the course of the 23rd European Interpol Regional  Conference.    In the words of Melnikov, due to certain telecommunications  measures, the system of prompt contacts between police services  of 44 countries incorporated in European Interpol will be  enhanced. The direct dialogue with colleagues from other  countries, noted Melnikov, helped us clear up some particularly  acute problems facing Russian law-enforcement officers, such as,  the wide-scale penetration into the country of weapons of  foreign make, including laser guns being bought by Russian  Mafiosi.</p>

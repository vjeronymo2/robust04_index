			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Premier issues rallying call to Italian youth MR Giuliano Amato, Italy's prime minister, yesterday called on the country's younger generation, made cynical by growing revelations of political corruption, to go into public service. Complaining of traditional weaknesses in Italy's public administration, which were reflected in its position in international bodies, he called on the young to take up a civil service career for moral, rather than just economic, grounds. 'We are always under-represented compared with our financial contribution in leading international organisations such as the European Commission and the World Bank,' he said. 'Before creating a European ruling class, we need to create a national ruling class.' His remarks, in a lecture at Milan's prestigious Bocconi University on the political responsibility of the class running the economy, came a day after President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro refused to sign a government decree Mr Amato had submitted to minimise the legal consequences for those accused of illegal political funding. Mr Amato's visit to Milan was his first to the city, which has spearheaded the country's growing investigations into political corruption, since he became prime minister last June. Seated in the front row was Mr Francesco Saverio Borrelli, Milan's chief public prosecutor who has headed the corruption investigations in the city. A statement opposing Mr Amato's decree on political funding, given in the name of Milan magistrates and read by Mr Borrelli to television cameras on Sunday, undoubtedly contributed to President Scalfaro's decision not to sign the decree. The audience included representatives from the top echelon of Italian business and finance, including a number of businessmen whose companies or families have become enmeshed in the corruption investigation. Among those present were Mr Giovanni Agnelli and Mr Cesare Romiti, chairman and chief executive of Fiat, and Mr Marco Tronchetti Provera, managing director of Pirelli, one of whose brothers was recently arrested by the Milan magistrates. Mr Amato, who was alternately heckled and cheered by students in the packed lecture hall, notably avoided any mention of the current investigations.</p>

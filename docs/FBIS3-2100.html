One objective is to ensure the full and smooth implementation  of the new tax system, the other being to ensure a steady growth  in tax revenues.    The provincial taxation work conference, which concluded  yesterday [23 February], revealed that the new tax system has  been functioning normally on the whole (?without increasing the  overall burden on enterprises) since the province began  implementing it more than a month ago. While the provincial tax  revenue in January was up 80 percent over the same month last  year, commodity prices did not fluctuate violently because of  the tax reforms.    The provincial tax bureau demanded that the vast number of  taxation cadres in the province conscientiously take good charge  of the study, propaganda of and training in the new tax system,  as well as fully and correctly implement the new tax system.  The cadres should also earnestly strengthen the administration  and use of the special receipt for value-added tax and further  do a good job in the [words indistinct] of value-added tax.  Taxation departments at all levels should earnestly and  properly track and supervise the implementation of the new tax  system.    Vice Governor Yu Xingde attended and addressed the meeting.</p>

			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / US Money and Credit: Investors have high hopes of Clinton delivering goods THE DATE February 17, when President Clinton is due to unveil his economic plans, is taking on immense importance for the US credit markets. For weeks now the bond market has been rallying in the expectation that Mr Clinton will unveil a package which seriously sets about reducing the US federal budget deficit. February 17 will determine whether or not that faith is well placed. The stakes are extremely high. Mr David Hale, of Kemper Financial Services, says it will be 'one of the most defining moments' of the Clinton Presidency and 'there is no way to overstate the importance of the message which it will convey, both in terms of policy substance and political themes'. A credible message could give a further boost to the bond market rally, while a botched job would almost certainly send the market sharply into reverse. For now, though, the market seems able to shrug off any amount of 'bad' news  -that is to say good news about the US economy, which normally sends bond prices lower on fears of inflation. The past week has brought a further raft of evidence to support the view that the US economy is now growing reasonably strongly: new home sales, car sales and retail sales have been surging; the index of leading economic indicators had its largest monthly jump in a decade in December; and factory orders leapt 5.3 per cent in January. Despite this, the bond market continued to rally, with the benchmark 30-year issue ending on Friday night with a yield of 7.15 per cent, down from 7.19 a week earlier. Several factors besides Clintonomics lie behind this strength. Perhaps most important, investors are finally coming to accept that inflation is not a near-term threat. Productivity improvements are helping the economy to expand with a minimum of cost pressures, as was underlined last week by figures showing a 4 per cent annual rate jump in productivity in the fourth quarter. Last Friday's much-awaited January employment report was also sufficiently mixed - a sizeable drop in the jobless rate was due mainly to people leaving the workforce - for the market to keep its nerve. Renewed overseas interest in US bonds may also have been a factor in the market's strength. Rate cuts on Thursday by both the Bundesbank and Bank of Japan make US yields that more competitive, while the strengthening dollar offers the possibility of currency appreciation. Additionally, the market was bolstered by an announcement that the government will be scaling back the size of this week's quarterly refunding auction, to Dollars 35.5bn from November's Dollars 37bn, with the cuts coming in the 30-year issue and 10-year maturity. The treasury left open the question, which has been circulating in Washington circles for more than a year, of a policy switch involving reduced borrowing at the 30-year maturity, in the hope of lowering stubbornly high long rates. The treasury is to do a 'thorough review' of the borrowing mix over the next few months. But the market's strength has also been due to the fact that just now good economic news may also be good for bonds, since a self-reviving US will put less pressure on Mr Clinton to produce an expensive stimulatory package (the market is happy with signs that he is aiming for around Dollars 31bn), and gives him more scope to cut the deficit. The long bond is already on the point of reaching its cyclical low of 7.11 per cent, and many analysts expect it to breach the 7 per cent barrier during 1993, taking yields to their lowest level in two decades. But first Mr Clinton must deliver the goods.</p>

			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AN ADAGE OF ROCK  </P> <P> Re Darrin Navarro's April 9 letter charging that I stole the quote about Elvis  Costello:  </P> <P> This is entirely the doing of the editor of the letters. My April 2 letter  said: "Perhaps the old adage is true: 'The reason critics hate House of Lords  (in this case) and love Elvis Costello is that most critics LOOK like Elvis  Costello.' "  </P> <P> My letter then went on to crucify critics (as, of course, they should be).  </P> <P> GENE SIMMONS  </P> <P> New York  </P> <P> Simmons is a member of the rock group Kiss. His "old adage" reference was  inadvertently deleted when his letter was condensed for publication.  </P> <P> Letters should be brief and must include the writer's name, address and phone  number. No pseudonyms may be used. Letters are subject to editing and  condensation. Mention date of publication when referring to a specific article.  Mail to Calendar Letters, Los Angeles Times, Times Mirror Square, Los Angeles  90053.  </P></p>

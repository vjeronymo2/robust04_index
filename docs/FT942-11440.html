			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Survey of International Corporate Finance (8): Insecurity at securities houses - The reluctance of UK investment banks to integrate activities In mid-March, it was announced that Kleinwort Benson and Barclays de Zoete Wedd were teaming up to bid - ultimately successfully - for the role as the British government's adviser on the next stage of electricity privatisation. To some observers, it was a clever combination of two companies who realised they were far more attractive together than either of them were individually. But to others, the implications were ominous. If companies, which already have reasonable expertise in advising, distributing and underwriting securities transactions cannot compete on their own for government privatisation business, what future is there for the non-integrated securities firm? In analysing how the US securities firms have transformed the business on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean, investment bankers say the most important contribution has been the structural role model; the integrated investment bank. In the years immediately following London's Big Bang, deregulating the old divide between those who broked securities for retail clients and those who traded them, firms made a mad dash to consolidate. UK and Continental banks bought up capacity, much of it at exorbitant prices, only to find the newcomer's business culture was alien to his own and could not be integrated. In Britain, some companies, such as Barings and Schroder, have determinedly stuck to their core businesses, declining to follow the US model and have done so highly successfully. Other Continental players follow the model of Dutch-based ABN-Amro. The bank acquired UK stockbroker Hoare-Govett in 1992 and says it wishes only to act as stockbroker, not market maker in securities. That approach, it says, has made it more attractive to corporate clients who fear the potential conflicts of interest at an integrated company. In the UK, industry participants point to the success of Cazenove, the family-owned stockbroking firm which dominates corporate broking in Britain. It has never made any pretense of integration and although its profits are not published, is said to have made steady progress all through the years of the latest UK recession. Another company which has eschewed the integrated route is Schroders, which posted record pre-tax profits in 1993, at Pounds 195.8m, an 85 per cent rise on the previous year. It also revealed its hidden reserves for the first time, showing it had some Pounds 102m in capital on its books. However, Schroders has relatively little capacity to distribute securities - a shortcoming which some analysts believe may undermine its ability to attract the corporate clients who contributed so much to its success last year. But the question for companies such as Schroders is whether the changes in the way companies are financed is so fundamental that only the multi-purpose securities house will be able to compete effectively. 'If you look around the globe outside Britain, you will see that the business is going the other way. It's all integrated - it's all singing, all dancing securities houses,' said a director at a leading UK merchant bank. Aside from reasons of tradition, City officials say there are some anomalies which make the non-integrated investment bank in Britain more resilient to competitive pressures than it would be elsewhere. For one thing, capital raising exercises for existing UK companies are almost always subject to the pre-emptive rights of current shareholders. That means the current shareholders get to buy new shares at a discount and those who help underwrite an offering earn a fee which bears no relation to the risk involved. In that environment, companies may seek the services of a separate corporate adviser and stockbroker. But if US-style book-building exercises ever came into play, merchant bank advisers would be risking their own capital in bringing issues to market, requiring them to have advisory, underwriting and distribution capacity. Integrated investment banking now encompasses the origination, structuring, issuing, trading and distribution of debt and equity securities at home and abroad. Other functions such as corporate finance advisory and mergers and acquisitions activities, as well as fund management are usually part of the core activities as well. 'The principal driver of most of these strategies is defensive,' analysts at Salomon Brothers, the US-based securities house, said in a recent research report. Because banks fear the loss of corporate clients to the securities markets - rapidly replacing traditional bank loans as the principal source of finance  -banks have had to alter their strategies. But increasingly, the Salomon report notes, integration means geographical integration - not just product integration. Indeed, the US investment banks, who top the league tables in almost every aspect of the securities industry, say it is their international expertise, not just their command of their home market, which has made them serious contenders for European corporate finance and merger and acquisition business. 'We can sell a German steel producer to an Indonesian buyer,' said one official at Goldman Sachs, the US-based investment bank which has been among the most successful in cracking the European markets. But that kind of global integration is simply not possible without a cash- generating home market, securities industry officials concede. 'To the extent that we have a significant presence in the US market we have been able to afford running an office, in say, Hong Kong at a loss for 10 years,' said one Goldman Sachs official. But outside the US, it is difficult to find a domestic capital market capable of generating that kind of cash. 'My greatest disappointment has been the realisation that we (in the UK) will never get the kind of home market out of the EC that we had hoped. At least not in my lifetime,' said a board member at one leading UK merchant bank.</p>

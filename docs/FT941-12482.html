			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Why you can't lose The National Association of Pension Funds has issued a pamphlet* aimed at people who believe that, because they do not plan to remain with one employer all their lives, there is no point in joining an occupational scheme since benefits will be lost with each move, writes Norma Cohen. The pamphlet points out, however, that frozen pension contributions will continue to rise in line with prices, up to a ceiling of 5 per cent, and that even those who have left a scheme can qualify for some additional benefits for their dependents. The advice comes as government regulators are preparing to review the files of nearly 500,000 people who may have been persuaded improperly to transfer their frozen pension assets to a personal pension scheme that makes them worse off in retirement. The NAPF is the industry's trade body and its chairman, Ron Amy, says: 'Even if you do not plan to spend many years in a job, it is still normally worth joining the pension scheme because you will continue to enjoy the benefits even after you have left it.' *'Leaving Your Job and Keeping Your Pension.' Available free by sending a stamped, self-addressed 9in x 4in envelope to Department CL5, NAPF, 12-18 Grosvenor Gardens, London SW1W ODH.</p>

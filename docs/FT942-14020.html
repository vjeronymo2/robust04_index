			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Anti-trust move on US teller network The US Justice Department yesterday cracked its anti-trust whip against the largest regional network of bank teller machines in US, in a move that could herald actions against other such networks. Ms Janet Reno, attorney general, announced her department had filed a proposal in federal court settling charges against Electronic Payment Services, which operates the MAC teller network mostly in the north-eastern US. The Justice Department said MAC had required member banks to use its computer processing services and used its control over the processing system to prevent member banks from joining up with competing networks. 'The MAC network has prevented more than 1,000 banks in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware and elsewhere from joining other ATM (automatic teller machines) networks in addition to MAC, the dominant network. This illegal practice affects one seventh of the population of this country,' Ms Reno said. ATM networks play a particularly important role in the US financial system because US banking laws prevent a bank from simply opening up a branch outside its home state, although in certain controlled circumstances they may operate in another state through a subsidiary. MAC is the largest regional network, with around 14,000 ATMs and 107,000 point-of-sale terminals serving around 28m card-holders in 26 states. Justice Department officials said its exclusion practices did not appear to be copied by other networks. Nevertheless, at a recent meeting of independent bankers Ms Reno invited complaints against other networks. MAC had already settled a suit brought against it by New York Switch, which operates the rival NYCE network, by agreeing to phase out its ban on allowing outside data processors to handle transactions over its network. Ms Reno said the settlement would increase consumer choice by allowing bank customers to take their cards to machines belonging to a range of competing networks.</p>

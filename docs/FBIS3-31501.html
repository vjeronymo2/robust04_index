In the opinion of the Polish president, the security of this  part of the European continent depended in a considerable degree  on the economic cooperation in the region.    "Societies want to live better and more peacefully. The  point is to add to these values, and not to go back or avoid  problems of the regional economic cooperation. It is necessary  to make use of all the possibilities," Walesa said, adding that  "we were living in a different epoch, in times of pluralism,  freedom and free market where there existed neither a frontal  threat nor confrontation."    Minister Botnaru stressed Lech Walesa's achievements in the  process of dismantling communism. He thanked the Polish  president for such a prompt recognition of the sovereignty of  the republics of the former Soviet Union.    The Moldovan minister assured Lech Walesa that Moldova would  not depart from the road of reforms which would be continued  irrespective of the election results.    The foreign ministers of Poland and Moldova, Andrzej  Olechowski and Ion Botnaru, respectively, presented to the  president plans of future cooperation between the two countries.  While speaking about the Polish minority in Moldova, Botnaru  said that soon there would be new legal solutions which would  make it possible for Poles to get back some buildings where they  would be able to conduct educational and cultural work.</p>

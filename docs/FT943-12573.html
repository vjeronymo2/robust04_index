			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Obituary: 'First lady' among German industrialists - Grete Schickedanz Grete Schickedanz, known as the 'first lady' in German industry, died last Saturday, aged 82, her family said yesterday. 'She was an outstanding personality among German industry,' said Mr Edmund Stoiber, prime minister of Bavaria and a prominent member of the Christian Social Union, the sister party of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's governing Christian Democrats. 'She had ideas and concepts, and she forms a part of Germany's, and Europe's, economic history.' Mr Richard von Weizsacker, the former federal president, described her as 'the First Lady of German industry'. As head of Quelle, Germany's - and Europe's - largest mail-order house, there was hardly a day this indefatigable lady did not take an interest in business. She was present when, in 1991, Quelle laid the foundation stone for its huge branch in Leipzig, in the eastern state of Saxony. Donned in furs and pearls, and flanked by Mr Kohl, she mused loudly that DM1bn (Pounds 400m) was a lot to invest in Leipzig, and wondered if the company could afford it. An aide was said to have replied quickly: 'Of course we have the money]' Quelle last year had a turnover of DM17bn. Since unification, it has invested more than DM2.5bn in eastern Germany, and is considered one of Germany's most successful privately-run businesses. Born in Furth, Bavaria, on October 20, 1911, Grete Lachner - her maiden name  -started in retailing at the age of 15 by joining Quelle, a company with a staff of five founded by Gustav Schickedanz, who was born in 1895. The coupled married in June 1942. During the 1930s, the company expanded rapidly, despite rampant inflation and unemployment. When the second world war broke out, Quelle had an annual turnover of 40m Reichmarks. Despite Allied bombing of its warehouses and its headquarters in Furth, near Nuremberg, the couple decided to set up business again in 1946. The business steadily regained its market share. It soon became the largest, most modern mail-order company in Germany, priding itself on quality for money and its fast and reliable service. Grete Schickedanz was also driven by a social conscience. At the end of the war, she founded a textile business to provide basic necessities for those whose homes had been destroyed. With Mrs Schickedanz at the helm, the group diversified in the 1960s and 1970s, particularly in film processing, fashion and furniture, and set up optician outlets throughout Germany. When her husband died in March 1977, Mrs Schickedanz continued to manage the business, rarely missing an opportunity to shape its direction, especially after German unification. She was helped by her two sons-in-law, Hans Dedi and Wolfgang Buhler, the current chairman.</p>

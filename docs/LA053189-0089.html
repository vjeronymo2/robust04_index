			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: QINTEX UNIT'S CHIEF NAMED UA PRESIDENT  </P> <P> David Evans, president and chief executive of Beverly Hills-based Qintex  Entertainment, has been named to those positions at its successor, United  Artists Corp. Australian-owned Qintex is acquiring the major Hollywood studio  as part of the $1-billion purchase of MGM/UA Communications, which will be  completed this summer.  </P> <P> Evans, who came to this country from Australia five years ago, also named four  key executives at UA. Not surprisingly, three of the appointees are from the  MGM/UA ranks and one is from Qintex. All have participated in managing UA since  the acquisition was announced March 31, the announcement said.  </P> <P> Richard Berger, president of the MGM/UA film group, holds the same title at UA.  Steve Mills, formerly senior executive vice president-programming at Qintex,  has been named president of the UA television production group. David M.  Forbes, MGM/UA marketing and distribution president, moves to the same position  at UA. John Goldwyn, previously MGM/UA executive vice president, was promoted  to president-production of UA's film group.  </P> <P> Qintex Entertainment Chairman Christopher Skase, who controls its parent,  Australian TV broadcaster Qintex Group, signed a definitive agreement to buy  MGM/UA from its 82% owner, Kirk Kerkorian. The agreement calls for Kerkorian to  buy back the MGM name and some other assets for $250 million. Kerkorian has  said he will make films with a new MGM.  </P> <P> As a result of the deal, Kerkorian also will be Skase's business associate. He  is to invest $75 million in Qintex group. Further, UA will distribute films  made by the new MGM, as well as from the 34-title, post-1986 MGM library.  Qintex will own the UA library, including the 1989 Academy Award-winning "Rain  Man." Turner Broadcasting purchased the old MGM library in 1985 from Kerkorian.  </P></p>

			<p>920729 FT  29 JUL 92 / Observer: Chopin around Birdsong, as Observer noted yesterday, may be the order of the day on Classic FM's test transmissions but its potential offerings are being peppered with birdshot. Shostakovich's ninth symphony is deemed OK but his sixth is definitely out. Likewise Samuel Barber's overture to School For Scandal is judged a no-no, while his Knoxville clears the audio-hurdle. With the help of the ear of broadcaster and writer Robin Ray, supplemented by those of a group of young music graduates, Classic's programme controller (and part-time tv chef) Michael Bukht says 5,000 pieces have already been found accessible and melodic enough to make the schedules when the station is launched in September.</p>

			<p><P> July 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ADVANTAGE, THE AMERICAN WAY;  </P> <P> AFTER FLEEING APARTHEID, AUTHOR MARK MATHABANE HAS HIS OWN SPECIAL SPIN ON U.S.  RACE RELATIONS  </P> <P> At times he seems a combination of Martin Luther King Jr., whom he paraphrases  often, and Gandhi, whose countenance he resembles, as he speaks in soft,  earnest tones while sporting little, round spectacles like the ones the Mahatma  wore.  </P> <P> Mark Mathabane, one muses, is a man in the process of self-creation.  </P> <P> The 29-year-old author of "Kaffir Boy in America" (Charles Scribner's Sons),  the recently published sequel to his best-selling autobiography, "Kaffir Boy"  -- his story of the horrors of growing up black under South African apartheid  -- is explaining why he is not as angry as he says many African Americans would  like him to be.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Knows Anger's Consequences  </P> <P> "Given my experiences with apartheid" (the white minority government's policy  of racial separation in South Africa), Mathabane finds it difficult to carry  the burden of so much hostility around with him daily, he says. "I know the  consequences of that much anger." It is self-defeating.  </P> <P> "That is the most important lesson my mother taught me. I had to transcend the  hatred and anger, despite the pain -- and that's likely a daily battle because  of the racist incidents I will encounter. But if I did not succumb to those  negative emotions, I had a better chance of preserving my humanity."  </P> <P> Sweat streaks Mathabane's smooth face as he reaches for a cup of orange juice.  He's sitting in the hot sun at the Tennis Place in Los Angeles after lobbing a  few balls over the net for a photograph.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tennis Helped Him Flee  </P> <P> Tennis is what allowed Mathabane to flee the circumscribed life ordained for  him by whites in South Africa. Wimbledon tennis champion Stan Smith met the  teen-age Mathabane while in South Africa. Smith saw the accomplished but  largely self-taught player at a tournament and arranged a tennis scholarship  for him at tiny Limestone College in Gaffney, S.C.  </P> <P> When Mathabane, who was more interested in grades than athletics (and never had  the talent to play world-class tennis anyway, he writes) lost his scholarship,  Smith continued to pay for his college education.  </P> <P> Smith and other whites have been very important to Mathabane's success in  America; though, after 10 years here, the author and lecturer says he is fully  aware of the racism that exists here.  </P> <P> Whatever bitterness he held toward whites because of the brutality he suffered  at their hands in South Africa had to be weighed against the "important  friendships I have formed with white people. I have accepted them for what the  content of their characters revealed."  </P> <P> Black Americans he has met while attending schools in the United States, and  those he has encountered while promoting the new book, often have difficulty  accepting this view, he says.  </P> <P> But "I know the danger of lumping all whites in the same foul band as the  racists and consigning them to perdition simply because of collective guilt. I  know the danger of doing that because the corollary . . . is this: What do you  do with those black people who inflict so much pain on their own people?"  </P> <P> Mathabane is leaning forward, his voice growing softer as his emotions  intensify.  </P> <P> "In South Africa, we had the (black) police and the heads of the homelands,"  areas to which the white government has forcibly relocated blacks, "who were  just as corrupt and brutal as the whites."  </P> <P> In the United States, "we have (black) drug dealers feeding poison to young  minds. So, do you say, because of my blackness I am in solidarity with those  people?" Unfortunately, he continues, "there are some who do, as is shown by  the startling example of a drug kingpin in D.C., who was arrested. When he  appeared in court, there was this vocal congregation of blacks there in support  of him, because the police who made the arrest were white. That is dangerous.  The reality is that there are good black people and bad black people, just as  there are good white people and bad. If we are ever to have the moral  consistency, which is the strongest weapon of our cause, we ought to have the  courage and willingness to be able to transcend judgment of people based on  their skin color."  </P> <P> When Mathabane speaks his voice is mellifluous, caressing and musical like so  many black South African accents. But each word is issued with the precision of  a needle entering a vein. So impressive is his manner of speech that one might  forget that his comments -- like his new book -- cover previously explored  social terrain, albeit it with uncommon poetic vigor and through the eyes of a  South African immigrant.  </P> <P> In 1979, while at Quincy College in Illinois -- it was his third school in one  year, at each of the others he'd been viewed as a loner by blacks and whites,  or too uppity, or too studious -- he discovered black literature. Richard  Wright's searing autobiography, "Black Boy," was the first. This classic, a  depiction of Wright's youth in the South, mirrored Mathabane's harrowing  childhood under apartheid.  </P> <P> The next day, he went back to the school library and asked for more books by  black authors. The Franciscan priest who was the head librarian "guided me to  the treasure.  </P> <P> "I checked out Richard Wright's 'Native Son,' Eldridge Cleaver's 'Soul on Ice,'  W.E.B. Du Bois's 'Souls of Black Folks,' 'The Autobiography of Malcolm X,'  Franz Fanon's 'The Wretched of the Earth,' Claude Brown's 'Manchild in the  Promised Land,' James Baldwin's 'The Fire Next Time' and 'Notes of a Native  Son,' Maya Angelou's 'I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,' James Weldon Johnson's  'The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man,' and the autobiography and incendiary  speeches of Frederick Douglass."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Consumed Western Classics  </P> <P> These men and women, Mathabane continues in his book, "had written about what I  felt and thought, what I had been through as a black man, what I desired, what  I dreamed about. . . ."  </P> <P> The idealistic author is clearly the repository of much intelligence, having  consumed the classics of Western literature and devoured the revolutionary  documents of the United States -- he traveled on the long, often bewildering  flight from South Africa to America with dog-eared copies of the Constitution,  the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence.  </P> <P> When he arrived, he was to learn that the America he had read about, heard  about on Voice of America broadcasts, seen on the cover of black magazines, was  grossly different from the reality. He saw subtle, socially sanctioned -- if  not legal -- apartheid in the United States. He saw black ghettoes in America  as squalid and filled with the panoply of pathologies bred of oppression --  alcoholism, domestic abuse, gangs -- that existed in his black township of  Alexandra where he grew up.  </P> <P> But he writes that in America, through education, he found "a second chance in  life -- a life I have dedicated to the struggle for justice."  </P> <P> Even when his intelligence is the echo of what others have already felt,  thought and dreamed, it does not negate whatever truth may exist there. And one  hears, as Mathabane speaks so carefully -- always seeming to weigh perception  against reality, fury against logic -- an intellect constantly refining itself;  a man tuning himself into a more astute receptor and generator of ideas.  </P> <P> On the difference between a black living in the American North and South,  Mathabane says: "In the North, the tendency was to pretend that 'We like you"  and then you turn around and you have this dagger going into your back. In the  South, you knew where you stood. If somebody didn't like you, they would tell  you to your face."  </P> <P> But, Mathabane adds, "in the South I have found more genuine progress than all  the liberal sentiments that I had heard in New York."  </P> <P> New York is one of the most "polarized cities in America. It is a two-tier  society with a vengeance and the people at the bottom of the totem pole are  black. You have your so-called liberals saying, 'Oh, don't worry. These things  will be taken care of.' But they perpetuate something that is just as deadly,  this attitude that black people are incapable of defining their agenda . . . of  pushing it as effectively as any other group." Rather, "they say 'Tell us what  is the problem and we'll do it for you.' "  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lives With Family  </P> <P> Mathabane now lives in Kernersville, N.C. -- between Winston-Salem and  Greensboro -- with his wife, Gail, a white American writer he met while at  Columbia University, their daughter, Bianca, and several of his siblings who  were brought to America by Oprah Winfrey.  </P> <P> In the South, Mathabane found "black communities that were some of the most  powerful and successful I'd seen anywhere. And there was not this destructive  anger. These people were content and proud and knew what it is that they were  fighting against."  </P> <P> The successful Southern black communities Mathabane saw underscore the  importance of identity and self-perception to black progress in America, he  believes. African Americans must think beyond their numerical status in  America, which makes them a minority, he says. They must see themselves as part  of the larger black world -- which includes Africa and the Caribbean -- but  most importantly as part of the "human" family, he asserts.  </P> <P> "We do ourselves a disservice by making it seem that our whole identity is  predicated upon race. As a black from Africa, as part of the majority, my  identity and pride were never that much in question -- even under apartheid."  </P> <P> Though immigrants by their nature -- driven, tenacious, bold -- are more  motivated than others, Mathabane believes that coming from a majority culture,  having a strong sense of identity and family values, accounts for the success  of so many West Indian and African blacks in the United States.  </P> <P> "It's amazing," he says, "what happens when you finally free your mind of those  mental shackles. When you realize that the most important thing I have to fight  as a black person in an oppressive, racist society is what I think about  myself. It is so easy to fall into the state of saying, 'I am a victim.' It is  formidable, but (African Americans) have to succeed in America despite racism.  You have to, this is your fate. This is your lot. You belong here."  </P> <P> If Mathabane sounds like a soapbox orator, it's because he believes words are  weapons. And he laments, in person and in print, that he may have come to the  United States a generation too late.  </P> <P> "The progressive movement in America has lost its soul," he writes. He longs  for the '60s when "courage and idealism" fueled "the civil rights movement, the  Great Society and the New Frontier." A time when "whites and blacks . . . stood  side by side."  </P> <P> He abhors the "rabid" conservatism of the Ronald Reagan years.  </P> <P> "I think Ronald Reagan has achieved a true revolution. He has turned blacks  into these creatures called buppies (black upwardly mobile professionals),"  bemoans Mathabane. These black counterparts to yuppies, he says, make the  "egregious mistake of forgetting that many of them came from a ghetto and that  they are needed in that ghetto, as examples, much more than anything."  </P> <P> Instead, "they arrange themselves in these enclaves and imbibe all the goals of  materialistic happiness, forgetting one of the important things about blacks is  their spirit of community. They forget that it does not take much to touch the  life of a boy or girl in a positive manner."  </P> <P> Mathabane, true to his beliefs, works with young people through his local  library, explaining to them the importance of education and how it transformed  his life. The first part of that life will be put on film by Winfrey, whose  production company, Harpo Productions, purchased the movie rights to "Kaffir  Boy."  </P> <P> In July, 1986, when Mathabane appeared on Winfrey's program, the talk show host  and philanthropist flew his grandmother, mother, three sisters and brother to  Chicago for the show. His mother saw America and told her son: "Child this is  Canaan. This is the land of milk and honey."  </P> <P> His family had lived in a place where there was one facecloth among them, where  police regularly raided homes, forcing family members to stand naked before the  dawn. Once here, they gave Mathabane a litany of why they loved America, he  recounts in his book:  </P> <P> "We aren't required to carry passes."  </P> <P> "We can go anywhere we want."  </P> <P> "We can ride in the same buses and use the same toilet as anyone."  </P> <P> "In America all people are equal."  </P> <P> Toward the end of his book, Mathabane writes: "I knew that there was more to  America than what my family saw, heard, or was exposed to, but I did not want  to lessen their sense of joy and liberation. After all, their visit to America  was only supposed to last a month. If they had to go back to South Africa, I  wanted them to know that somewhere they could breathe free. . . ."  </P></p>

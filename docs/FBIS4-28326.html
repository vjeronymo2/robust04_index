			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Japanese Authorities Must Stop Suppressing Chongnyon and </F> Koreans in Japan At Once and Apologize for it -- DPRK Foreign  Ministry Statement --" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, June 9 (KCNA) -- The DPRK Foreign  Ministry issued a statement today denouncing the Japanese  authorities' suppression of the General Association of Korean  Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) and Koreans in Japan.    The statement reads:    Japan has carried into extremes its hostile policy toward  Chongnyon and our republic today.    The Japanese authorities recently committed another fascist  outrage by sending several hundred police and raiding the Kyoto  prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon in broad daylight and  searching many places including houses of Chongnyon officials on  the groundless pretext of "violation of the national land  utilization law" in the wake of their undisguised crackdown on  the Osaka prefectural organizations of Chongnyon in April.    This is part of the premeditated anti-DPRK moves the  Japanese  authorities committed by taking advantage of the U.S. attempts  to isolate and stifle our republic over the "nuclear issue". It  signifies the beginning of their wholesale suppression of  Chongnyon. It is a grave challenge to our republic, an  independent and sovereign state.    The DPRK Government strongly denounces the Japanese  authorities' suppression of Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan,  considering it the worst human rights abuse, an illegal act of  political repression and a typical example of their national  chauvinistic crime.    Now, the Japanese authorities are running about recklessly,  standing on the forefront of the United States' anti-DPRK  "cooperation system".    They went the length of making haste with legislative  measures for the establishment of a wartime system like  "emergency legislature" in anticipation of "sanctions" on our  republic, and even crying for sea blockade.    This is an open revelation of Japan's will to involve itself  in another war of aggression on Korea by following the United  States in case of emergency.    The entire Korean people can hardly repress resentment at  the  fact that Japan, which occupied Korea for nearly half a century  and inflicted immeasurable misfortunes and hardships upon it, is  still suppressing and persecuting by means of strong arm Koreans  in Japan, the victims of drafting by her and their descendents,  without any justification, far from atoning for its past crimes  through generations.    The Japanese authorities who have consistently pursued a  hostile policy towards us are now intending to stage a comeback  to our republic, joining the United States and the South Korean  authorities in crying for "sanctions" over the "nuclear issue".  This shows that their aggressive nature remains unchanged.    It is a mistake if Japan, which raked in big profits with  the  backing of the United States during the Korean war, expects  another "shower of gold" in a second Korean war.    The time has already changed.    If Japan, failing to atone for the never-to-be-condoned  crimes it had committed against the Korean people in the past,  should take the van or be inevigled or join force in any  "sanctions" against us, we would regard it as a declaration of  war, and Japan would be unable to evade a deserving punishment  for it.    The DPRK Government and the Korean people strongly demand  that the Japanese authorities promptly stop their suppression of  Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan and apologize for it and sternly  punish the chief culprits in the case.    The Japanese authorities must immediately give up such  foolhardy acts as pursuing a hostile policy toward our republic  and suppression of Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan.    We will closely follow every move of the Japanese  authorities.</p>

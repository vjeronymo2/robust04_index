			<p><P> November 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LABOR: WORKPLACE DEMOCRACY COULD REVITALIZE DOUGLAS  </P> <P> There's no doubt about it: The small group of executives at the  multibillion-dollar McDonnell Douglas Corp. needed tremendous courage when they  wisely decided earlier this year to revolutionize the way of life at their  Douglas Aircraft subsidiary in Long Beach.  </P> <P> They knew that they would create near-chaos initially among both managers and  the 17,600 Douglas workers when they started trying to make the company a model  of workplace democracy, probably the largest yet attempted in the United  States. Workplace democracy means involving workers directly in company  decision making.  </P> <P> The executives also knew that, like most revolutions, their own would almost  surely ignite a counterrevolution that could destroy the new system and further  weaken the financially troubled company.  </P> <P> Even if the revolution succeeded, success could take months and perhaps even  longer to be realized, and a lengthy time lapse between the first wobbly  beginning and a thriving workplace democracy could seriously hurt the company's  already lagging production schedule and its standing on Wall Street.  </P> <P> However, it was a gamble worth taking. The dramatic changes being made offer  the best chance for Douglas employees to improve their jobs and incomes and for  the company to start making substantial profits.  </P> <P> Other giant corporations such as General Motors, Ford, and AT&amp;T have  introduced workplace democracy in some of their facilities. But the joint  venture of General Motors and Toyota at the New United Motors Manufacturing  Inc. (NUMMI) plant in Fremont, Calif., is one of the few using the system as  extensively as Douglas plans to do. And NUMMI involves far fewer workers.  </P> <P> Douglas' entire organizational structure was streamlined. There was a drastic  and much needed cut in the number of management levels. The number of workers  in each team was sharply reduced to an average of nine, and they are headed by  elected instead of company-appointed team leaders.  </P> <P> Almost every working day at 4:30 p.m., top company executives meet with  officers of the United Auto Workers or other elected worker representatives to  jointly make decisions about almost all company policies.  </P> <P> Human resources vice presidents and worker representatives have offices so  close to one another that they can make daily decisions together by walking at  most a few feet to talk to each other face to face. Most shop floor decisions  are made by workers and their team leaders. In sum, Douglas ain't what it used  to be just a few months ago, and it isn't what it will be in a few more months  -- if, that is, all goes as the nervy company and union leaders plan.  </P> <P> One of the more troublesome "ifs" is the infighting among members and officers  of UAW Local 148 that represents most of the Douglas Long Beach workers.  Another equally troublesome problem is the confusion and bitterness in the  ranks of management.  </P> <P> UAW Local 148 is badly split over both the concept of workplace democracy and  the way that it is being implemented at Douglas. They are fighting each other  more furiously than they often battled management in the past.  </P> <P> Some, like a relatively small faction of UAW members and leaders across the  country, see the new system as a sellout that allows both company and union  officers to join forces and unfairly manipulate workers.  </P> <P> A majority of delegates at the million-member UAW's last convention supported  workplace democracy, but those who fear it continue denouncing those trying to  make it succeed.  </P> <P> And those who like it, such as UAW Local 148 President Douglas Griffith, have  nothing but contempt for those trying to either get rid of the system directly,  or indirectly, by demanding so many drastic changes that the system will die  from the shock of major surgery.  </P> <P> The naysayers at Douglas belong to a group called RAP (Responsible Action  Program), and RAP members are linked to a nationwide dissident faction within  the UAW called New Directions.  </P> <P> One RAP member and former local official, Glen Plunkett, says workplace  democracy may be able to succeed at Douglas, but not while men like the local's  president, Griffith, have anything to do with it. That's a clear sign that  internal union politics are a factor in the system's future at Douglas.  </P> <P> But Griffith exudes confidence: "We want to get to a self-managing work force,  where managers are coaches, mentors and cheer leaders, not traditional  policemen."  </P> <P> Also optimistic is UAW Regional Director Bruce Lee, who is an architect of the  system that is working so well at NUMMI and is helping to make it operational  at Douglas.  </P> <P> The system can function well if Lee and others in the UAW can minimize union  politics and get the workers to cooperate both with each other and with  management. Lee insists that will be done.  </P> <P> The other big "if" in the path of success at Douglas is the cooperation of  company managers, some of whom are frustrated by the drastic change that has  already taken away much of their old authority.  </P> <P> That management side of the problem began when key corporate executives shocked  5,200 managers, supervisors and other company executives last February by  telling them that they were not being fired but that almost all of their jobs  were being eliminated.  </P> <P> Those who wanted to could stay by reapplying for a job and passing personality  and other tests to make sure that they really were leaders who could be team  players, not just order-givers.  </P> <P> The decision, so abruptly announced, that managers must democratize or get out  badly damaged morale. The goal of bringing about the necessary sweeping  attitudinal changes could have been handled with more finesse.  </P> <P> But at least Douglas managers are not uncertain now about the general direction  that they are supposed to be going as managers. And when their roles are  defined more clearly, they can join Doulgas workers and the union in  effectively implementing an exciting example of democracy in the workplace.  </P></p>

			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Glaxo falls on FDA silence Pharmaceuticals group Glaxo underperformed the sector in thin trading as disappointed marketmakers adjusted their trading books after the group failed to receive US approval for two of its products. The US Food and Drug Administration, which is responsible for licensing the use of new or adapted pharmaceuticals treatments tends to make about a third of its annual approvals at the end of the year. It was expected to sanction the sale of Imigran, the anti-migraine treatment in tablet form, and Serevent, Glaxo's anti asthma treatment. Some traders who had bought stock or marked up prices in advance of an announcement were clearing their dealing books yesterday. The shares dipped 9 to 725p, ending the year little changed although they have clawed back from a low of 514p in the summer.</p>

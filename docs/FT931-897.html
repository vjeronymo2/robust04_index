			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Man in the News: A bold leap into the Big Blue - Lou Gerstner / The appointment of a new boss at IBM The fate of the world's largest high-technology company - ailing International Business Machines - was yesterday entrusted to a man who knows plenty about selling cigarettes, crackers and credit cards, but who is no computer expert. IBM announced that its two-month search for a new chief executive had ended with the appointment of 51-year-old Mr Lou Gerstner, chairman of R J R Nabisco, the cigarettes and food business, and former president of American Express. He will succeed Mr John Akers, who is stepping down early because of the company's poor financial performance. Mr Gerstner takes on one of the hardest jobs in corporate America - turning around a company which has been synonymous with US industrial might for the past 30 years but is now floundering for direction, with an entrenched bureaucratic culture which responds too slowly to the pace of change in the information technology industry. In choosing Mr Gerstner, the IBM board is taking two gambles. The first is that the company's problems can be fixed by a new broom - a 'change agent' in the fashionable management jargon - who comes not only from outside the company, but from outside the computer industry too. The second is that Mr Gerstner is the right agent of change, for while he is often described as one of America's best managers, his track record at R J R is mixed. Some American observers argue that IBM's main problem is a lack of technological vision, which Mr Gerstner will find hard to provide. But others maintain the company's difficulties stem from weak management, which he may correct. Mr James Burke, the director who headed IBM's search, indicated yesterday that the board took the latter view. 'The company is not run as much like a business as it needs to be,' he said, pointing out that technological know-how was only one of eleven qualities the board listed as desirable. Others included 'unusual leader with immediate credibility' and 'customer-oriented'. Mr Gerstner, the son of a distribution manager for a New York brewing company, took an MBA at Harvard and spent his early career at management consultants McKinsey &amp; Co before joining American Express. It was there that he made his name as a clever strategist who played a crucial role in revitalising the credit card business. He eventually became heir-apparent to Mr James Robinson, the chief executive ousted in a boardroom coup earlier this year. 'The best young manager I've ever seen,' one eminent non-executive director of American Express once said of him. But in March 1989, possibly frustrated at playing second fiddle to Mr Robinson, Mr Gerstner accepted one of the most enticing business challenges of the day - to shake up poorly performing R J R Nabisco, which had just been acquired by management buy-out specialists Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts in the biggest and most ferocious takeover bid of the 1980s. Mr Gerstner slashed R J R's bloated cost structure and quickly sold off some Dollars 6bn of peripheral assets to help reduce the buy-out's Dollars 30bn debt burden. The company's borrowings are now down to a manageable Dollars 14bn, thanks to a series of refinancings. This experience will be invaluable in tackling one of IBM's most pressing problems - the excess fat which still afflicts the group. Despite numerous rounds of job cuts, observers reckon IBM may still need to cut its 300,000 work-force by up to 100,000. Furthermore, Mr Gerstner's personality, and status as an outsider, should help him revive a stifling, inbred corporate culture in which decisions are too often made to protect individuals or groups rather than to increase competitiveness. He is a stocky, round-faced, impatient man who elicits considerable loyalty from staff despite sometimes seeming insensitive. 'His insensitivity is going to be a problem at IBM,' says an old friend, 'because there are a lot of teddy bears who like to be hugged.' In his first year at R J R he travelled more than 150,000 miles, talking to people at all levels of the company, and he is likely to bring a similarly down-to-earth approach to IBM, where insiders often complain about the remoteness of top management. Additionally, his preference for setting broad strategy but then delegating responsibility down the line is likely to fit well with IBM's own devolution programme, implemented by Mr Akers a year ago. This involves its various businesses acting increasingly independently - and possibly being spun off altogether - while the chief executive's role becomes, in Mr Akers's phrase, that of a 'portfolio manager' allocating cash and managing central services. But while Mr Gerstner's cost-cutting credentials seem good, there is less certainty about his ability to expand a business over the long term. In the three full years since the buy-out, R J R's operating profits have been flat at about Dollars 2.9bn. Tobacco is the larger of R J R's two divisions and makes a handsome return on sales. However, with cigarette consumption on a slow but relentless decline in the core US market, the game is all about grabbing market share. Here, R J R's record has not been impressive. According to Mr John Maxwell at analysts Wheat, First, Butcher, &amp; Singer, the company's total share of the US cigarette market has slipped from 31.8 per cent in 1988 to 28.8 per cent last year, while its arch-rival, Philip Morris, has moved from 39.3 per cent to 42.3 per cent. On the food side, the story is similar, albeit more cheerful. At home, Nabisco has generally clung on to its chunky market shares in the biscuit and snacks markets. But it had to cope with a slowdown in US consumer spending; a squeeze by retailers; and a price war. Increased marketing support has been needed and profit growth has been slow. In short, there have been successes and failures and the prevailing view is that much has yet to be proven. 'Mr Gerstner created a strategic plan and is probably more than a third of the way through,' says Mr Barry Ziegler, analyst at A G Edwards. 'But now he's leaving in mid-stream.' One of his toughest tasks at IBM, given his non-computer background, may be articulating a new sense of strategic and technological direction. The company has clung for far too long to the bulky mainframe computer, and its own proprietary software, while the world around it has moved to much greater reliance on desktop models arranged in networks and using standard software. IBM still has to decide its role in the computer industry of the 1990s, and then dispose of those parts of the business which do not fit. This involves placing tough technological bets. Still, Mr Gerstner is not a complete technological novice and he has a reputation as a very rapid learner and a man who surrounds himself with good, diverse lieutenants. He took a degree in engineering, and sits (or did until yesterday) on the board of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph. At American Express, one of the world's most sophisticated users of information technology, he was the moving force behind the development of an important new computer system. 'He really likes this stuff', says an old colleague. He also has an invaluable, intimate adviser in his brother Richard, who ran IBM's personal computer business and Asian operations before retiring recently because of ill-health. IBM itself is hardly short of technological talent. The challenge for Mr Gerstner is to tap it effectively. A popular move, inside the company and the computer industry generally, would be for Mr Gerstner to appoint well-respected technologist Mr James Cannavino as group president, succeeding Mr Jack Kuehler, who will retire this year. Mr Cannavino currently heads IBM's personal systems division - the personal computer and computer workstation businesses. By pairing the two men, IBM could achieve a balance between hard-driven 'portfolio management' and technological vision. There is a successful precedent for the leap Mr Gerstner is making. Ten years ago, Mr John Sculley, then chief executive of Pepsi-Cola, amazed the business world by joining Apple Computer, which after a bumpy patch has become one of the world's most successful personal computer companies. However, in an interview some years ago Mr Sculley said he felt it essential for the head of such a company to have a clear grasp of technological directions and acknowledged that it took him several years before he felt confident in this respect. At IBM the issues are bigger and more complex than at Apple, and Mr Gerstner does not have the luxury of a long learning curve. The crisis requires rapid action.

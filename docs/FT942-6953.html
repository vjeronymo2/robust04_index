			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / S&amp;N sells 450 pubs for Pounds 108m Scottish &amp; Newcastle, the brewing and leisure group, has sold 450 former Chef &amp; Brewer pubs for Pounds 108m. The pubs have been bought by a private company created by Mr Michael Cannon, the former chairman of JA Devenish, the pub group which was bought by Greenalls last year for Pounds 214m. Mr Cannon's new vehicle, the Magic Pub Company, has sold on 168 of the pubs for about Pounds 30m to Labatt, the Canadian brewing group which has been expanding in the UK. Labatt now has 526 pubs, making it the UK's fourth largest independent pub retailer. Scottish &amp; Newcastle gave an undertaking to sell 450 pubs from the 1,650-strong Chef &amp; Brewer chain when it purchased them from Grand Metropolitan in November. It still must sell a further 700 pubs within a year to get below the 2,000 ceiling set by the government's 1989 Beer Order. Mr Cannon acquired a half-interest in a Bristol pub for Pounds 30,000 in 1974. He went on to float Inn Leisure on the USM in 1982. In 1986 Inn Leisure's 40 outlets merged with Devenish's 314, and Mr Cannon became chairman and chief executive of the full group the following year. Mr Cannon, 52, whose family's stake in Devenish was worth Pounds 26m at the time of last summer's takeover, said his wife had thought he was going to retire - but he could not resist this opportunity. He said: 'This deal creates at a stroke a major new independent force in the highly-rated free trade pub sector. Over the next few years we will make a sizeable investment in refurbishing and upgrading the estate and believe we can enhance its performance significantly.' Mr Michael Izza, managing director of Labatt UK's retailing said: 'Part of our plan for growth is to buy pubs in order to own our retail distribution. We intend to carefully expand our pub retailing interests as quality locations become available.' Labatt brands are distributed in more than 10,000 UK pubs and its Canadian lager is one of the top 10 lager brands. Mr Cannon and his team were advised by Flemings. The Pounds 100m financing package includes Pounds 57m of senior debt underwritten by Flemings and Lloyds Bank. The equity came from management themselves and a Pounds 23m syndicate led by CINVen.</p>

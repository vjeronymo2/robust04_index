			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / Japan's defence budget likely to be reduced THE JAPANESE defence budget is likely to suffer its first cut in real terms for 32 years under plans for the 1993 budget drawn up by the Finance Ministry. The Y4,700bn (Pounds 25bn) defence budget has become one of the main targets for Finance Ministry cuts to finance higher investment in public works to help to revive the flagging economy. Although the main reason for the cut is the need to stimulate the economy, it marks the long delayed impact of the end of the Cold War on Japanese defence policy. The planned cuts in the 1993 budget are likely to lead to a review of the medium-term defence spending plan, adopted in 1990, which envisaged real growth in the defence budget of 3 per cent a year between 1991 and 1995. Defence spending in Japan has had a privileged status despite the country's constitution which limits the role of its forces to providing a minimum level of national self-defence. Between 1961 and 1979 defence spending grew at an average of about 14 per cent a year. In the 1980s the growth slowed but was always more than 5 per cent a year. Last year's budget rose by 3.6 per cent and this year the defence forces have called for a 3.8 per cent increase in spending. The Self Defence Agency is fighting a fierce rearguard action against the Finance Ministry which is believed to have proposed the budget should be cut to below 1992 levels. A senior SDA official said: 'We will never accept zero growth.' The debate should come to a head in the second week in December. The SDA says Japanese defence policy needs to reflect the strong growth of defence spending in nearby South Korea and China. It also argues there is limited room for cuts because about 80 per cent of the budget is made up by staff costs or payments on contracts which have already been awared. The SDA believes the budget will need to be expanded to respond to calls from the US for Japan to carry a larger burden of the costs of US forces stationed in Japan as well as international peace keeping operations. The debate over the budget is complicated by negotiations between the defence forces and the US government over plans for Japan to buy two Awacs reconnaissance aircraft. A deal is likely to be made within the next few months adding about Y120bn to the budget. This would make a significant contribution to reducing Japan's politically sensitive trade surplus with the US. Overall public spending is likely to grow by about 1 per cent to about Y72,000bn. However spending on public works will rise by about 5 per cent to about Y8,600bn. This will mainly be financed by cuts in current expenditure on welfare programmes, which account for Y12,300bn and education (Y6,000bn) as well as defence. Despite the low growth in overall spending, Finance Ministry officials describe the budget as supportive because they are maintaining spending despite a drop of about Y5,000bn in tax revenues.</p>

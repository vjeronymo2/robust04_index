			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / International Company News: Grolsch plans to sell German brewery Grolsch, the Dutch brewer with UK links, yesterday announced plans to sell Wickuler, its German brewery, only three years after acquiring it. Wickuler is to be sold for an undisclosed price to Brau und Brunnen, the large German brewer, in exchange for handling the distribution of Grolsch lager throughout Germany. Grolsch said the partnership with Brau und Brunnen would allow it to lift its beer distribution in Germany more quickly than using Wickuler to gain gradual access for the Grolsch brand. It expects more than 6,000 cafes in Germany to stock Grolsch within the next few years. News of the deal comes less than two weeks after Grolsch announced an agreement with Bass, the UK's largest brewery, to set up a joint venture company to market and distribute Grolsch lager in Britain and Ireland. Grolsch's 1991 acquisition of Wickuler was hailed at the time as a bold but rare attempt by a foreign brewer to capture part of Germany's severely fragmented beer market. Grolsch restructured Wickuler and reduced its range of 20 local beers to three main regional beers that are popular around Germany's Ruhr region. It halved the workforce to 400 people and closed the Wuppertal operation in favour of the main brewery in Cologne. However, the company said yesterday the trend towards concentration in German brewing had placed it in a dilemma - either match the pace of acquisitions by bigger German brewers or find a German partner for distribution. Grolsch, which owns Ruddles in the UK, declined to give the sale price for Wickuler or comment on earlier reports that it paid about Fl 100m (Dollars 52.6m) for it in 1991. In Amsterdam, Grolsch's shares rose by 3 per cent to close up Fl 1.50 at Fl 50.50 after an earlier high of Fl 51.50.</p>

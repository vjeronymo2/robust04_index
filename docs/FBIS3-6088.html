			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Persistent Anti-Military-Base Move Is Needed"] </F>   [Text] A Japan-U.S. foreign and defense ministerial  Security Consultative Committee meeting was held at the prime  minister's official residence in Tokyo on 11 March. At the  meeting, the issue of U.S. military bases on Okinawa was taken  up. In a joint announcement released after the meeting, it was  specified that "the two sides pledged to continue their efforts  for consolidation and realignment of facilities and areas,  particularly on Okinawa."    At a vice ministerial meeting held at the Defense Agency  after the joint announcement was released, U.S. Defense  Undersecretary Frank Wisner reportedly hinted at the possibility  of the early return of the Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield.    Since the coalition government was inaugurated, Okinawa  Prefectural Governor Ota; concerned cities, towns, and villages;  and civic groups have been looking forward to seeing progress in  talks on military base affairs. We appreciate the fact that at  the first security consultative committee meeting under the new  government, the United States indicated a forward-looking  attitude on the return of lands being used by the U.S. forces  and the abolition of military practices.    When the U.S. official's remarks on the return of the  Yomitan  Auxiliary Airfield by end of this year were reported, Yomitan  residents welcomed the report with happy expectations. However,  the relocation of the parachute training area and the  maintenance of functions of the adjacent communications facility  are preconditions for materializing the "early return" of the  Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield. When Director General Yoneyama of  the Defense Facilities Administration Agency [DFAA] visited the  United States on 26 February, a high-raking U.S. official showed  him a forward-looking attitude in connection with the return of  the airfield. In view of this, it can be said that Defense  Undersecretary Wisner's reported remarks were to reconfirm what  the high-ranking U.S. official said to DFAA Director-General  Yoneyama.    About this time last year, it was constantly reported that  the U.S. forces were considering relocating the parachute  training area to Camp Hansen adjacent to Kin town and Ginoza  village, which later objected to the relocation of the training  area. Unless this issue involving both Kin town and Ginoza  village is settled, Yomitan villagers will not be able to openly  welcome the return of the Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield.    At the ministerial meeting, Foreign Minister Hata and  Defense  Agency Director General Aichi singled out the issues stemming  from the military bases and called for the return of the Naha  Port, the stoppage of live-fire exercise across highway 104, and  the return of the Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield. In response,  Secretary of State Christopher reportedly said that he is aware  of the situation.    If the U.S. forces should again study possible construction  of the parachuting training area in Kin town, which is calling  for stopping the live-fire exercise, it would run counter to the  Japan-U.S. announcement that "the two sides pledged to continue  their efforts for consolidation and realignment of facilities  and areas."    The two governments have to bring those issues to a  satisfactory settlement with the outcome of the ministerial  meeting confirming that each military base issue is an important  issue to be solved.    The Japan-U.S. Security Consultative Committee, which was  originally started as a vice ministerial-level meeting, was  upgraded to a ministerial meeting in December 1990. The two  sides held the first ministerial meeting recently with the goal  of reconfirming the two countries' stand of maintaining the  Japan-U.S. security system amid worsening bilateral economic and  trade relations.    On the issue of military bases on Okinawa, the joint  announcement says: "The continued harmonious use of facilities  and areas by U.S. forces in Japan is indispensable to deterrence  and to the readiness of U.S. forces in Japan." We believe that  maintaining harmonious relations between towns and villages is  also indispensable in addition to harmonious relations between  the locals and U.S. forces.    The Yomitan Village Office has already mapped out its own  plan for use of lands after their return. But before that, it  is necessary to solve such issues as land ownership involving  former land owners and farmers who are tacitly allowed to engage  in farming in the area of the Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield. At  the same time, it is necessary to take this opportunity to give  impetus to moves calling for the return of military bases and  the solution of issues resulting from military exercises.</p>

			<p><P> February 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JURY AWARD IN CHRISTIAN CASE  </P> <P> The award of $21.75 million to Hudson's lover for his "emotional distress"  makes a laughing stock of justice in this country, and opens a veritable  Pandora's box.  </P> <P> Unless this verdict is eventually reversed, one can foresee an army of  "ambulance chasers" entering the scene. Every living or recently deceased AIDS  victim who had some wealth will now be a possible legal target by any of his  previous sex partners, even if they did not in fact contact the disease.  </P> <P> Perhaps the assessment of damages should not be done by juries, but by a  committee of realistic professional experts.  </P> <P> JACK BLANKLEY  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

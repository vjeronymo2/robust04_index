			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Candidate of Geographical Sciences V. </F> Baranovskyy: "Ukraine--Incidence of Disease Among the  Population"]    [Text] The very concept of "health" is evaluated in  different ways, and debates continue surrounding the concepts of  "health" and "illness." The most expansive concept of "health"  today was proposed by the WHO in 1963: "Health is a state of  complete physical, spiritual and social well-being of the  population, and not only the absence of disease and physical  defects."    Significant structural-dynamic violations of human health,  physical development and changes in the nature of the pathology  of the population are taking place under difficult contemporary  ecological conditions--a gradual rise, in the pattern of  morbidity and mortality among the population, of the share of  non-epidemiological chronic illnesses and a corresponding  decrease in the share of infectious diseases. The causes for  these phenomena include the fast pace of life and an  acceleration of production rhythms. Disruptions of the  ecological equilibrium and, as a consequence, increased  nervous-emotional strain in the face of a certain  conservativeness of the functions of the organism, occur as a  result of the constant interference of man in nature, and could  be the cause of complications in the health of the population.    Most indicators of health, as is well known, are of a  negative nature (morbidity, mortality, invalidity etc.), giving  an idea of the state of health versus an "opposite." The  incidence of disease among the population is the most sensitive  indicator describing the influence of the environment on man,  but the statistical values are not always sufficiently reliable  or comparable. Mortality, on the contrary, can be considered as  a conditionally resultant influence of the environment. This  indicator is subject to compulsory recording, with a uniform  categorization of the cause of death accepted both in this  country and abroad. The official indicator of the morbidity rate  is calculated over a year per 100,000 population. It is  subdivided into initial (first revealed) and overall (rate of  illness, extent). The latter includes the morbidity rates of  past years for a certain moment in time, and morbidity as  revealed for the first time.    The map offered to the readers depicts the level of  initially  revealed morbidity of the population by oblasts, and its  structure and dynamic over 10 years. The structure of the  morbidity rate, as we see, is predominated by diseases of the  respiratory organs, nervous system, skin, circulatory system  etc. The structure of the mortality rate of the population  presents a different picture. First is mortality from diseases  of organs of the circulatory system, then newly created  malignancies, accidents and others.    The analysis we performed showed that the territorial  breakdown of the incidence of disease among the population  correlates closely with the ecological situation in Ukraine.  This question is considered in more concrete fashion in the  "Medical-Biological Atlas of Ukraine," now completed by the  author. It comprises text and map portions. The cartographic  section includes the author's maps and maps that have been  published by other specialists. The total size is 123 pages, of  which 71 are maps, 45 of those by the author. The map scales are  1:7,000,000 (one centimeter to 70 kilometers), 1:6,000,000 (one  centimeter to 60 kilometers ) and 1:5,000,000 (one centimeter to  50 kilometers).    The cost of publishing the atlas is about 3,000--5,000  dollars U.S., and it will thus not be possible to manage without  sponsors. An abridged, "newspaper" version of the atlas will  come out soon as a special supplement to the newspaper ZELENYY  SVIT.   <FIG ID=JPRS-USR-049-30A>      Ukraine: Incidence of Disease Among the Population </FIG>     1.

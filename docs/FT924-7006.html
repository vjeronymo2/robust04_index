			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Survey of Turkish Finance, Investment and Industry (4): Policies criticised as incompatible / Banking - a successful sector. But are there too many players? LIBERALISATION has brought with it two big questions. Is Turkey overbanked? And is it over-regulated? Concern also remains as to whether it is over-dominated by the big four: Ziraat (the largest commercial institution, with branches in London, New York and Frankfurt, and which controls about 40 per cent of total deposits and supplies credit to the agricultural sector), Akbank, Isbank and Yap ve Kredi. Banking is one of the country's most successful economic sectors - not least when performance is identified on the Istanbul Stock Exchange - though profits are currently leaner than last year. But arguments have persisted, which Mr Rusdu Saracoglu, the central bank governor, tactfully tides over, about the extent to which the government is committed to curb inflation and is resorting to short-term advances from the central bank in order to finance economic growth. Mr Saracoglu regrets that the central bank is seen as 'an arm of the government', rather than an independent entity. The World Bank also wonders whether the government has a coherent banking policy for the next three years. Inflation of about 70 per cent in itself causes less concern than a feeling that the government should try to find a balance between the inflation rate, the growth rate, the balance of payments and the financing of the budget deficit. But the governor has urged that Turkey should follow the German example and make the central bank more independent of the government, and even impose a legal limit on the value of bank notes in circulation. The central bank believes there are too many small banks, and that new licences handed out by the Treasury were a mistake. Of more than 80 local players, including commercial and investment banks, only 12 had more than 100 branches, and 25 have less than 10. Some bankers argue that Turkey is not overbanked, but over-branched. Mr Erol Sabanc, managing director of Akbank, one of the most profitable institutions, has said: 'I don't believe we need so many banks. Mergers among government banks can and should be done, and also in the private sector.' But since the sector seems to be profitable and successful, there is resistance to change. In theory, the 1980s were a decade of reform and restructuring, to enable Turkish banks to integrate and compete in the international arena. Interest rates on loans and deposits were freed, as was the foreign exchange market. However, much of the state-regulated system has remained - hampered by the political in-fighting of the various offices which control and run the economy. Liberalising legislation came into force at the beginning of 1980, when there were 5,975 bank branches and total bank deposits amounted to TL813.7bn (Pounds 64.7m). Interest rates were floated, and soon rose exorbitantly, leaving the already under-capitalised banks with a large quantity of non-performing loans, and encouraging more informal finance houses to start business. At the end of 1990, there were 40 deposit-taking banks, eight of which were in the public sector. There were also 26 foreign banks. As with the rest of the economy, the banking system faces some confusion in the sometimes contradictory views it receives from the offices of Mr Suleyman Demirel, the prime minister; Mrs Tansu Ciller, the minister of state with responsibility for the economy; and Mr Rusdu Saracoglu. The last has held his position since July 30 1987. Also at issue has been the question of whether certain govenment policies are compatible. For instance, given the aims of sustaining economic growth and making the economy more competitive internationally, is it also realistic to expect to keep inflation low? There has been some streamlining of domestic commercial banking, through improvements in trade finance, cash management, personnel training and technology. Standardised reporting and external auditing have become common practice. Meanwhile, the past year or so has not been without difficulties. 'The year 1991,' the governor of the central bank said last April, 'proved to be a rather difficult one in conducting monetary policy. . . We entered with the advent of the Gulf war. The environment of uncertainty hit the banking sector hard, and in just 10 days, nearly 12 per cent of total Turkish lira deposits and 11.5 per cent of foreign exchange deposits were withdrawn from the banks.' The governor claims, with some justification, that the central bank's intervention prevented a damaging flight of capital - even at the cost of running down reserves. Political uncertainties resulted in a general election, but, as the governor pointed out: 'For the first time in its history, Turkey managed to hold a general election without resorting to any foreign exchange restrictions.' Yet he remains staunchly at odds with having to fund the government's soaring public deficit, as are the authorities involved with the privatisation of state economic enterprises - particularly where the public sector is involved. Turkey's banking ambitions extend outside the country. Its Eximbank has extended credits of Dollars 50m to Hungary, for the import of Turkish intermediate, consumer and investment goods, and Dollars 50m to Uzbekistan. Last May, Mr Demirel announced a Dollars 1.2bn package of export credits and soft loans for six of the Moslem central Asian states. In 1991, Turkey's Eximbank had nominal capital of TL2,000bn, and aimed to increase the competitiveness of exports. But perhaps the government in Ankara should look more closely at banking problems at home before becoming over-ambitious abroad.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                 TURKEY'S TOP BANKS: 1991 (DOLLARS M)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                           Tier One    Capital/assets   Pre-tax                           capital        ratio (%)     profits   Assets  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1  TC Ziraat Bankas         700             6.74         385    10,383 2  Akbank                   543            14.90         294     3,646 3  Turkiye Is Bankas        262             4.81          94     5,449 4  Yap ve Kredi             260             6.93         101     3,746 5  Turkiye Garanti Bankas   213             9.11          96     2,334 6  Turkiye Emlak Bankas*    153             2.77          51     5,510 7  Vakflar Bank             130             4.28          25     3,032  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *1990                                Source: The Banker, September 1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

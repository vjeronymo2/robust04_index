			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Letter: G7 - the capital picture and political reality Your leader 'G7 under pressure' (April 30) was right in castigating the US but wrong in minimising the problems of potential capital shortages. Demand for capital has been outstripping supply at record levels in recent years, so leading to historically high real long-term interest rates. These rates will go still higher in the period ahead. This will result from still greater increases in public sector borrowing by leading industrial countries (the US federal government may alone borrow upwards of a record Dollars 300bn this year) and from significant borrowing by Middle East and east European countries (albeit not as massive as some have suggested, but nevertheless significant). The G7 issued a statement at the end of its meeting in typically arcane and abstruse language. At least it acknowledged 'the persistence of high real interest rates'. Let us hope that when it meets in London at the summit level in July it can be clearer - real long-term rates will only start to fall when most of the G7 governments cut their mounting budget deficits. Meanwhile, given the bleak outlook for long-term rates, corporate borrowers need to focus far more on equity financing; developing countries and those in eastern Europe need to accelerate the pace of privatisation, while institutions such as the EBRD and IFC need to do far more to assist these countries to build securities markets.

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Following his two and  one-half hour meeting with UN special envoy Joe Clark today,  President Rauf Denktas told journalists: We are discussing the  issues you know about. The point is that either the amended  document should be restored to its original form or certain  elements that we consider satisfactory should be added to it.  Denktas said that after his meeting with Kliridhis tomorrow,  Clark will probably bring certain answers to the Turkish Cypriot  side. Asked if elements satisfactory to the Turkish Cypriots  will be added to the package, Denktas said: I do not know. We  will see tomorrow.    Denktas pointed out that the UN officials are insisting on  their proposals while the Turkish Cypriots are insisting on  their own views. He stressed that the Turkish Cypriot side made  certain flexible proposals during the talks and will wait for  the results.    Replying to another question, Denktas said the element of  time is still being stressed in the talks. He said: According  to the UN officials, tomorrow is the last day, but if they see  any encouraging signs, they will probably stay another couple of  days.</p>

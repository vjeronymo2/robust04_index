			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / International Company News: Hungarian drug group rises 190% CHINOIN, the Hungarian pharmaceuticals company in which Sanofi of France has a substantial minority shareholding, increased after-tax profits by 190 per cent for 1991. Chinoin's net profits rose to Ft2.29bn (Dollars 29m) on sales of Ft14bn. The performance owes much to the success of Jumex, the drug against Parkinson's disease which was the first Hungarian compound to be approved for use in the US, and Ipriflavon, a treatment for osteoporosis. Royalties from the two helped Chinoin increase sales in western countries by 44 per cent and compensated for the collapse of the Soviet market. Chinoin's earnings trend indicates that the profit-related purchase price for the 40 per cent stake acquired by Sanofi will move towards the top end of the Dollars 75m-Dollars 150m range agreed with the Hungarian authorities last year. Sanofi also has an option to take its shareholding to a majority from 1994. Chinoin's figures contrast markedly with those of other western joint ventures in Hungary which have generally suffered disappointing sales and profits.</p>

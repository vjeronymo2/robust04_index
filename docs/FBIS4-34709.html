			<p>BFN     [Text] London -- Economy Minister Jorge Camet has said that  Peru wants a Brady Plan-style agreement to reduce the debt it  owes to banks before the end of the year. He said he hopes to  conclude negotiations with creditor banks by the end of the  year, and has great expectations over the amount by which the  debt might be reduced. He explained that commercial banks have  taken several provisions to prevent losses in Peru, and that  consequently the government hopes to make a good deal. Peru owes  international commercial banks approximately $6 billion, 50  percent of which is overdue interest.    Camet said Peru should be given favorable treatment on  payment of overdue interest. "We will obviously be granted a big  discount on capital and interest," he said.    The minister noted that the Democratic Constituent Congress  (CCD) should conclude its investigations into the alleged  irregularities involving the Mantaro and Pachitea ships in order  to expedite negotiations over the foreign debt.    Talks with Peruvian creditors have been delayed pending a  resolution by the Chemical Bank and American Express, which  granted $37 million in credit for buying the ships.    Camet explained that the Peruvian Government does not intend  to return to the international capital markets soon. "Instead of  borrowing to repay our debt, we must arrange to repay it over a  long period. Peru has enough reserves for one year of imports.  Besides, we must repay our rescheduled debt," he said.    The minister attended a conference sponsored in London by  the  International Herald Tribune and by the Inter-American  Development Bank. In his lecture, he said that Peruvian  economic reforms are irreversible, and that the result of the  presidential elections scheduled for April 1995 will not affect  them.</p>

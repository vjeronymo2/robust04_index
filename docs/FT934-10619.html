			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / UK Company News: J Sainsbury rings up 11% rise - Supermarket opening programme to continue at upwards of 20 a year THE FURORE surrounding J Sainsbury's announcement that it was cutting prices on 300 own-label lines obscured an 11 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 434m. The figures for the 28 weeks to September 25 were broadly in line with analysts' expectations but could not stop Sainsbury's shares falling 15p to 385p as the food retailing sector was hit by fears of a price war. 'These are really very good figures, which suggests that Sainsbury's was not forced into launching its price campaign because it was losing sales,' said one analyst. 'It has chosen to seize the initiative.' Group turnover increased 10.9 per cent to Pounds 5,87bn, with total sales in the UK up 9.1 per cent to Pounds 5.18bn. Sales in the supermarkets division increased 8.9 per cent to Pounds 4.66bn, with existing stores contributing 1.8 points of the increase and new space 7.1 points. Grocery inflation is running at about 2 per cent, which means underlying sales in Sainsbury's existing stores have fallen slightly since last year, but Mr David Sainsbury, chairman, said it was not a cause for concern. 'Underlying sales have been going up only slightly or going down slightly for the past 10 years,' he said. 'It's nothing new.' Supermarket operating profits rose 13.3 per cent to Pounds 391.1m. Mr Sainsbury said the company planned to continue opening between 20 and 23 supermarkets a year, but admitted the company was unlikely to enjoy the sales growth it had in the past, increasing the importance of developing the other businesses. Savacentre, the hypermarket operation, increased sales 7.2 per cent to Pounds 332.2m, with operating profits up 17.8 per cent to Pounds 19.1m. Sainsbury opened its first new Savacentre for three years this year and said it saw scope for expanding the chain from 10 stores to between 25 and 30. Homebase, the DIY chain, increased sales by 14.7 per cent to Pounds 181.9m and operating profits by 31.6 per cent to Pounds 11.9m. In the US, which Sainsbury now sees as an important avenue for expansion, the Shaw's supermarket chain lifted sales 4.2 per cent to Dollars 1.04bn, (Pounds 680m) with operating profits up 17.7 per cent to Dollars 25.2m. Earnings per share increased by 9 per cent to 16.34p, with the interim dividend raised from 2.7p to 3p.</p>

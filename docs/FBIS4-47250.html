			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Conversation between Yelena Svetova and Vladimir </F> Sergeyevich Kovalenko, academician, New York Academy of  Sciences, professor, Kiev Polytechnic Institute (KPI), director,  Institute of Laser Equipment and Technology, interspersed with  commentary: ``Just Born and Already Universely Known. So They  Say of the New Laser Equipment and Technology Institute Recently  Appearing on the Scientific Map of the Ukraine''; the first four  paragraphs are an introduction]    [Text] In actuality, scientists already long ago called  this department of the university in the capital an  ``institute.'' Indeed, it was difficult for them to visualize  that the personnel of the laser technologies laboratory of the  KPI were by themselves capable of reaching the world level of  development work and that the results of its activity would draw  the closest attention in many countries.    And indeed, the former laboratory director, now the director  of the new institute, professor Vladimir Kovalenko, is  acknowledged to be one of the world's leading specialists in the  modern technologies field. Accordingly, he was one of the first  in the former USSR to be elected an academician of the New York  Academy of Sciences and has become a member of the most  prestigious international organizations of laser specialists,  the coauthor and coeditor of many ultramodern scientific  publications and catalogues.    The new scientific research institute is a structural  subdivision of the Kiev Polytechnic Institute, intended to bring  together the efforts of scientists at the university and many  research institutes for solving problems in the scientific  branch. This will assist considerably in regeneration of the  Ukrainian economy.    At the KPI research in the field of laser equipment and  technology has already been in progress for more than 30 years.  The university laboratory, headed by Professor Kovalenko, has  been transformed into a singular interbranch instructional,  methodological and scientific center. His students have proposed  to practical workers more than a few new methods for large-scale  working of objects from metal, their hardening and local  alloying, using laser radiation. Control points have been  established at many enterprises where KPI representatives are  helping to introduce modern technological processes.    ``Many feel that the establishment of new scientific  institutes at the height of a very serious crisis is Utopian.  After all, you are in no position to receive the most necessary  material resources. How do you dare take the risk?'' I say in  addressing the director.    ``On the other hand, we have a primary resource --  intellectual,'' responds Vladimir Sergeyevich Kovalenko. ``Only  several years ago the former USSR accounted for more than  32%  of the world's engineers and scientists, with the Ukraine  accounting for about 7%. This is an enormous potential on  which  our young country rests its hopes. With respect to the  technologies which we have developed, it is precisely they which  it is desirable be used extensively in our complex times. They  are easily applied in small shops and laboratories and in  commercial service facilities where they can be used  successfully in cutting, joining and marking metals and other  materials and filling a great many other orders. And saturate  the market with products produced without gigantic production  sites and unwieldy equipment.    Why are many academic institutes on the rocks? They are in  the stage of introduction of innovations into industry for  organizing new experimental lines of production (when  considerable sums have still not been earned) and have no  relatively inexpensive work force. We, adhering to the  experience of the leading, well-developed countries, intend to  rely on young people, students, who have energy, enthusiasm,  assertiveness and ambition. They have their entire lives before  them and therefore they do not fear to take a risk.    And still another circumstance. I became aware of it during  my foreign trips, especially the last, when over the course of  several months I lectured at one of the largest universities in  the United States, located at the center of the state of Ohio.''    ``I see here: in the documents which the Americans gave you  were called a `Distinguished Visiting Professor'...''    ``It appears that they have such an official title. But let  me finish my thought. Abroad they regard our work with extreme  respect, they intend to cooperate with us, carry out joint  research experiments and exchange students. And representatives  of the Ukrainian diaspora are even interested in having their  children receive a higher education in the Ukraine. This will  mean additional income for the KPI.''    The cessation of the activity of the Council for Mutual  Economic Assistance (SEV) and the disappearance from the map of  such a country as the GDR for only a short time stopped the  scientific and creative contacts between the two largest  universities in Europe -- Kiev Polytechnic Institute and the  ``Friedrich Schiller'' University at Jena. Now it is not  ideological compatibility, but the significance of the research  conducted at the KPI which has again attracted the attention of  German scientists and has forced renewal of the joint work on  developing new laser technologies and diagnostic systems which  was interrupted for a year (this work was carried out earlier  within the framework of the Complex Program of the Member  Countries of the SEV, intended to run to the year 2000).    ``As a result of cessation of SEV activity, the funding of  our joint work also ceased,'' continues Professor Kovalenko.    ``For some time we knew nothing about the future fate of our  joint research. But then a letter was received from Germany in  which they proposed a new program to run until 1995. It is  ensured funding by the Association of Rectors of German  Universities and makes provision for activation of the exchange  of specialists and intensification of scientific research in the  field of laser technologies and equipment.''    For a long time Professor Kovalenko presented lectures to  students and specialists in China, Japan and many other  countries, also including countries of the former socialist  camp, with which mutually advantageous agreements also have been  concluded.    The distant island of Taiwan, with which the Ukraine has no  diplomatic relations and where we have no trade or cultural  representatives, opened its formerly tightly sealed doors to the  scientists of the Ukraine. The first among them to be invited  was Vladimir Kovalenko. Over the course of three weeks he  presented lectures and consulted with Taiwanese colleagues on  new technologies. The principal organizer and sponsor of the  visit of Vladimir Sergeyevich to the island was the general  director of one of the largest international companies in the  world engaged in the fabrication and application of computer  systems, which is located there. It specializes in deliveries of  very complex equipment to the countries of East Europe.    ``Recent events have made possible a new look at the problem  of using the latest advances in science and technology in  different economic branches,'' says the scientist in ending our  conservation. ``We can and must develop fundamentally new  aspects of increase in the quality of production, find  many-sided approaches to the introduction of highly efficient  technologies under conditions of a developing market. The former  mechanisms of innovative processes are hopelessly outdated.    Despite the crisis we have succeeded in acquiring a solid  material base: laser apparatus, computers and other equipment.  The Laser Technology Center, which includes the new institute  and the department at the KPI, will provide strong encouragement  for the development of a high-priority field and will enable  Ukrainian scientists rightfully to enter the world laser  community.''</p>

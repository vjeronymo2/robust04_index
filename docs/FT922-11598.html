			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (11): Bourses are deflated by the Bundesbank's refusal to compromise THE SECOND quarter is traditionally a relatively quiet period for continental European equities, as shareholders participate in capital-raising exercises which have been announced with the previous year's corporate results, or wait for dividends to be paid before making fresh share purchases. But this year any share price rises in the April-June period are likely to be tempered by a higher risk factor, caused by interest rate considerations and political uncertainty. Last month, investors began to question the timing of the first interest rate cut in continental Europe, when an overshooting of money supply growth and stubbornly high inflation in Germany prompted the Bundesbank to reiterate its commitment to a stable Deutsche Mark. A growing consensus that German interest rates would not be reduced until well into the second half of this year deflated buoyant stock markets throughout the continent. According to the FT-A World Indices, Europe excluding the UK closed the first quarter with a gain of 7.1 per cent in local currency terms, compared with a 10 per cent gain at the beginning of March. The Bundesbank's refusal to compromise on interest rates, despite evidence that countries throughout Europe need a looser monetary policy to boost their flagging economic strength, has prompted speculation that a realignment in the exchange rate mechanism (ERM) is necessary. It is difficult to guess who would take the lead. France believes that its interest rates are artificially high, because of Germany's dominant position in the ERM; Belgium and the Netherlands have little fiscal flexibility; and Italy is committed to its 'lira dura' policy. Even Portugal's recent entry into the wide band of the ERM was not seen as an opportune moment. Current fears that a revaluation of the D-Mark is inevitable are likely to hang over continental bourses during the current quarter. European stock markets are also unsettled by the emergence of vocal minority parties in France, Italy and Germany. Italian shares slid 7.3 per cent in March, on fears that the new 'leagues' in the prosperous north would attract voters away from the leading parties in the general election on April 5, which would make it harder than usual to form a lasting coalition government. France, by contrast, was cheered by the sacking of its first female prime minister, Edith Cresson, at the start of April. She was replaced by the finance minister, Pierre Beregovoy, who is liked by the stock market because of his commitment to improving equity investment in France and his hard line on inflation. Lisa Hosking, global strategist at SG Warburg Securities, says France is a 'clear success story', because French companies have become much more competitive through restructuring, and, through their transatlantic acquisitions of the past few years, will benefit from the eventual economic recovery in the US. Also, shares in highly-leveraged companies will react swiftly to any cut in domestic interest rates. Germany, whose new-year rally has been capped by the Bundesbank's stance on inflation, is likely to tread water in the second quarter, until wage negotiations in the engineering and public sectors are completed. However, its longer-term outlook remains positive, with earnings expected to recover in 1993, and the removal of supplementary taxes at the end of July should revive domestic consumer demand. Spain proved to be a big disappointment in the first quarter, because persistently high inflation ruled out the hoped-for cut in interest rates. In spite of its being one of the cheapest European markets, analysts have also been put off by the lack of improvement in the wage structure.</p>

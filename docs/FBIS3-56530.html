			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Vilnius, Jan 17, BNS -- MP Vytautas Petkevicius,  member of the ruling Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party [LDDP],  was approved as the new chairman of the parliament's National  Security Committee Monday.    Petkevicius was supported by all seven committee members  present at the meeting. Five other committee members, all  representatives of the rightist opposition, were not present.    The new chairman said he will resign immediately if work  does  not go smooth in the new post. Petkevicius said his primary aim  is to deal with the critical situation in the armed forces. 82  deaths were reported in the Voluntary State Defense Service over  the past two years. Legal action in the state defense system was  taken 162 times for the loss of weapons, assaults and other  criminal offenses.    Petkevicius was elected in accordance with the parliament's  resolution saying that the post would belong to the ruling LDDP  faction. But neither Petkevicius, not three other members of the  committee, have registered themselves on the LDDP faction after  the new faction registration rules came into effect.    Petkevicius was the acting chairman of the committee for  several months after the resignation of MP Gediminas Kirkilas.  [passage omitted]</p>

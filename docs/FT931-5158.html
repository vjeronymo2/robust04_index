			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Swiss voters show signs of human weakness THE Swiss have long prided themselves on having such a strong civic sense that they will even vote for tax increases. Yesterday, true to form, 55.2 per cent of those voting in a referendum approved an increase in fuel taxes that will raise petrol prices by 20 centimes (9p) per litre. But some Swiss see this, and the positive outcome of another vote yesterday, on legalising gambling casinos, as evidence of a less admirable and perhaps ominous trend among their countrymen. According to this view, these votes show that the Swiss are becoming more like everyone else. They would rather let the government tap new and relatively painless sources of income than have it cut services to reduce its bloated deficit. The Swiss federal government's deficit has soared in the past two years, reaching SFr2.86bn (Pounds 1.3bn) last year, about one per cent of gross domestic product. Rising welfare payments and revenue shortfalls caused by the recession mean that this year's budget deficit of SFr3.3bn will be substantially exceeded, Mr Otto Stich, the finance minister, has predicted. Mr Stich tried hard last autumn to win his colleagues' support for swingeing spending cuts. When he failed, he proposed the two revenue raising measures that were approved yesterday. Mr Stich said that the petrol tax would add SFr1.3bn a year to federal coffers, while still leaving Swiss petrol prices lower than those in neighbouring countries. He claimed casino legalisation would merely bring Switzerland in line with other European countries, but opponents argued that their country did not need another institution for money launderers to test. Mr Stich believes the government, which proposes to take 80 per cent of casinos' gross revenues, will raise about SFr150m a year from this source, but it is unlikely to come quickly. Police forces have warned that neither the potential casino operators nor the law enforcement agencies are competent yet to deal with the kinds of criminals attracted to casinos. A third national referendum, calling for the total abolition of vivisection, was overwhelmingly defeated, with 72 per cent of those voting opposed. The issue is a frequent one in the Swiss plebiscite lists. Swiss voters return to the polls in June on two highly controversial topics related to the Swiss army. One petition calls on the people to forbid the army from buying new fighter aircraft for 10 years. The other would reduce the number of battlefield train ing grounds at the army's disposal.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 21 KYODO -- A senior Liberal Democratic  Party (LDP) official said Tuesday he got the impression that  North Korea has nuclear weapons during his recent trip to  Pyongyang.    "From the series of talks (with North Korean officials), I  got an impression that the country possesses nuclear weapons,"  Yoichi Tani told a press conference.    Tani, along with former Defense Agency head Taku Yamasaki,  visited North Korea last week and held talks with North Korean  officials, including Korean Workers' Party Secretaries Kim  Yong-son and Hwang Chang-yop.    Tani criticized recent remarks by Prime Minister Tsutomu  Hata, who said he did not believe North Korea has atomic bombs.  "I don't have the slightest idea why he said such a thing," Tani  said.    Yamasaki, also at the press conference, said North Korea is  now considering opening the door to its market after solving the  nuclear issue diplomatically.</p>

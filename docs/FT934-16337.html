			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / 'We only have weeks to agree on HK' BRITAIN and China have 'weeks rather than months' to agree on Hong Kong's political development before the legislative process will have to be set in train, Mr Chris Patten, the colony's governor, said yesterday. Mr Patten flies to London early next month for a cabinet meeting at which ministers will discuss the way ahead for Hong Kong. It is expected that this meeting will decide whether to push ahead with the colony's political development without China's approval. In opening the 1993-94 session of the Legislative Council (Legco), Hong Kong's law-making body, Mr Patten said Britain believed that a legislature which was openly and fairly elected was the best way to underpin the rule of law in the colony. In seeking a credible legislature, 'there is a point beyond which I do not believe that we could justifiably go, even in the pursuit of an agreement (with China) to which we genuinely aspire.' The governor confirmed that during the summer Britain had offered to reduce the size of the electorate able to vote in elections due in 1995, and had fallen in line with China's preferred structure for an electoral college which will choose 10 of Legco's 60 members. Pro-democracy politicians have accused Mr Patten of a 'huge climbdown' and a betrayal of his democratic agenda. The governor ended his speech with an impassioned defence of the democratic ideal and challenged Hong Kong and its legislature to stand up for what it believed. Britain would not be more bold in introducing democracy than Hong Kong wanted it to be. 'We cannot be bolder than you because liberty stands in the heart. When it shrivels there, nothing can save it.' During his two-hour address Mr Patten made a plea to China to separate issues relating to Hong Kong's economy from its dispute with Britain over the colony's political development. Beijing's failure to approve a planned expansion of Hong Kong's container port would cost the colony, after 1997, an estimated HKDollars 20bn (Pounds 1.7bn) in lost output, Mr Patten added. Its refusal to deal with matters before the Joint Liaison Group (JLG), a Sino-British diplomatic forum negotiating the detail of Hong Kong's transfer to China, risked the colony's 'vital legal and commercial relations with the outside world'. Hong Kong residents' rights to visa-free travel, the validity of air-service agreements, extradition treaties, and the rights on non-Chinese after the takeover were in limbo because of Beijing's decision not to co-operate in the JLG. 'If progress in the JLG does not speed up significantly, there is a high risk that the work will not be finished before 1997, and we will then face a legal vacuum,' Mr Patten went on. He also sought to shrug off his image as a one-issue governor, also promising more money for education, health, the arts and the environment, as well more money to fight corruption and to be used for roads to improve trade with China. The governor also foreshadowed a government position paper on pensions and outlined a legislative programme designed to bolster consumer protection and safety at work. He reiterated the government's forecast of a 5.5 per cent growth in output in 1993 but shaved its inflation forecast to 9 per cent from 9.5 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, April 23 (AFP) -- An estimated 7,000 people  marched through Paris Saturday [23 April] to protest the Bosnian  Serb shelling of the besieged Moslem enclave of Gorazde.    Marchers were jeered by a group of around 80 Serb protestors  denouncing what they called a "witch-hunt" against Bosnian  Serbs, and police had to intervene to separate the two sides.    The march, called by around 20 human rights groups and  trades  unions, was led by a number of personalities including writers  Bernard Henri Levy, Daniel Rondeau and Pascal Bruckner.    Organizers said 7,000 people took part in the march. Police  put the attendance at around 1,200.    Demonstrators chanted "Weapons for Bosnia" and "UN, why do  you let them (the Moslems) be killed?"    They called for the use of all means, including military, to  save the town, which came under renewed Bosnian Serb shelling  Saturday in defiance of Friday's ultimatum from the North  Atlantic Treaty Organisation to halt their offensive immediately  or face air strikes.</p>

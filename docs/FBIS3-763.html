Only a few white Bophuthatswana government  officials arrived for work at the government offices in Mmabatho  and there was little economic activity in the downtown  Mmabatho/Mafikeng central business districts.    Hardly any public transport was running during the usually  busy early morning peak hour. Mini-taxis were standing idle at  their ranks and most vehicles on the roads were driven by white  motorists.    The Mega City shopping complex in central Mmabatho, which  was  looted on Thursday night, was still closed on Monday morning.  Most shops and department stores in Mafikeng were also closed.    There was still a strong presence of South African troops  deployed on street corners and protecting key points in Mmabatho  and Mafikeng.    The South African Defence Force has declined to give details  of the number of troops sent to Bophuthatswana to quell the  disturbances. But it would appear that at least two crack army  battalions equipped with a variety of highly mobile armoured  personnel carriers are deployed in the Mmabatho/Mafikeng area.</p>

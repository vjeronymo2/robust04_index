			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["We Will Determinedly Counter U.S. `Special Inspection' and </F> `Sanctions', DPRK FM Spokesman" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, June 7 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the  Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  today answered a question put by KCNA as regards the recent  statement of the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State, Gallucci,  alleging that the DPRK has unilaterally forced core refueling,  deliberately destroying the possibility of later measurement of  fuel rods.    He said:    His statement is inconsistent with the fact.    There has been a series of contacts between us and the  United  States over the question of core refueling operation.    At the contact on May 28, we transferred to the U.S. side a  document explaining our method of preserving the technical  possibility of later measurement of fuel rods.    Expressing interest in our method, the U.S. side promised us  to give an answer after sincerely studying it by mobilizing its  home nuclear experts.    It even said that the third-stage talks would be possible,  if  the technical possibility were preserved, whether the pace of  core refueling operation was fast, or not.    We have awaited an affirmative answer from the United  States,  encouraged by such attitude of it.    And we had the willingness to thrash out a compromise by  coordinating the opinion that might be raised by them in the  answer.    The U.S. side, however, far from giving an answer to us,  unilaterally declared that the technical possibility for the  measurement of fuel rods had been destroyed, timing to coincide  with the submission of an unreasonable report by the secretariat  of the International Atomic Energy Agency to the United Nations  Security Council.    We are simply surprised by this.    After all, we have had no consultation with the United  States  on the question of the method of preserving the possibility for  the measurement of fuel rods and have lost the last chance of  meeting it halfway.    As can be seen in the above, it is not the DPRK but the  United States that refused a compromise over the measurement of  fuel rods and broke the foundation of the third-stage talks.    The United States is now coming out with the ill-boding  assertion that since the possibility of the measurement of fuel  rods was gone, "a special inspection" of the two military sites  should be made.    Keeping pace with it, the agency is bringing forth the issue  of "a special inspection" again.    So, it is obvious that the United States, ignoring our  method, unilaterally declared that the possibility of the  measurement of fuel rods was gone, motivated by the intention to  invent a pretext of "a special inspection."    The present situation reminds us of march last year when we  declared the withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty, rejecting "a special inspection."    The demand for "a special inspection" is a gross  infringement  upon our sovereignty and a graphic expression of the policy for  stifling the DPRK.    The inspection of our military sites is out of question.    Our position for resolving the issue through dialogue and  negotiation remains unchanged. But we will resolutely counter  without the slightest compromise any attempt to encroach upon  our sovereignty, crying for "a special inspection" and  "sanctions." This is the unswerving will of all our people and  Army.</p>

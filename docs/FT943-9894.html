			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Kuwait KUWAIT yesterday signed a contract with a Russian state arms company to buy armoured personnel carriers and multiple rocket launchers, the state news agency Itar-Tass reported, writes Chrystia Freeland in Moscow. Kuwait is the first country to buy Russia's Smerch rocket launchers, which are the successors to the Katyusha system. A spokesman for Rosvooruzhenye, the state company through which the weapons are being sold, would not specify the price or quantity of armaments negotiated in the contract. Yesterday's deal is the most recent step in Russia's effort to revive its massive but cash-strapped defence sector by finding foreign buyers for the arms the Kremlin no longer wants or can afford. Government officials said yesterday that the Ministry of Defence, traditionally allowed nearly unlimited access to the state purse, is falling behind in payments to arms factories. The government's debt to the defence industry is one reason for Russia's dramatic fall in industrial production this year.</p>

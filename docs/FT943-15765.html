			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / International Bonds: Borrowers take advantage of re-awakened eurolira sector After a lull due to the volatility of the Italian government bond market, three borrowers took advantage of renewed interest in the eurolira market and attractive swap opportunities to launch L700bn-worth of issues yesterday. Dealers said swap opportunities had been available for a week or more, as the gap between the secondary eurolira bond market and the lira swaps market widened, allowing deals to be priced with double-digit coupons. The growing yield differential between German and Italian bonds and the perceived weakness of the lira then started to attract retail investors and portfolio managers back to the eurolira market, in spite of continuing nervousness about the Italian government bond market. Austria's Osterreichische Kontrollbank launched the first of the three five-year issues, a L200bn offering of 10 per cent bonds arranged by Swiss Bank Corporation, followed by a L200bn deal with a 10 1/4 per cent coupon for Deutsche Bank. The third deal off the blocks was a L300bn offering for Commerzbank, arranged by IMI Bank. The issue made up for its late arrival and slightly lower rating (the other two are both rated triple-A) with a 10 1/2 per cent coupon. In spite of concern that the heavy flow of paper would quickly exhaust interest, dealers reported demand from Germany, Switzerland and the Benelux region. The concentration on the five-year area, where the best swap rates were available, suited retail investors. Two large yen offerings for the Province of British Colombia, which launched three small deals in the sector on Tuesday, and the Kingdom of Sweden were driven by strong demand for yen assets from Japanese investors. Japanese institutions had been selling US bonds due to currency concerns and were cash-rich, dealers said. The 4 per cent coupon on British Colombia's five-year issue via Daiwa and the 3.10 per cent coupon on Sweden's short-dated deal arranged by IBJ proved attractive, according to traders, as Japanese investors such as insurance companies are interested in coupon rather than yield spread levels. In the D-Mark sector, the triple-A rated City of Paris launched its first foreign currency bond offering, a DM130m five-year deal arranged by Banque Paribas. Decentralisation has allowed French municipalities greater freedom to diversify their funding, which traditionally has mainly come from the French agency, Credit Local de France. The deal was targeted at retail investors in Germany, Switzerland and the Benelux region. In the dollar market, Essar Gujarat, the Indian steel company, launched the first floating-rate note by a private-sector Indian company. The deal was broadly placed with institutions according to lead manager Chase Investment Bank.</p>

			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Islamic bank opens in Jakarta Indonesia's first Islamic bank opens today with the express support of President Suharto and other leading members of the government. Bank Muamalat Indonesia will not offer interest rates but will instead pay 'profits' accrued from deposits, writes william Keeling in Jakarta. 'It's a sham, really. Profit payments are interest rates under a different name,' said one local banker. Critics argue that the timing of launching the bank, which has a capital of Rp100bn (Pounds 27.6m), is designed to boost the Islamic credentials of the ruling Golkar party in the first week of an election campaign.</p>

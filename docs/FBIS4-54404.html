			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 28 (CTK) -- The Czech Republic and  Bulgaria hold identical views on the prepared conference of the  "Stability Pact" to take place in late May in Paris, Czech and  Bulgarian Foreign Ministers Josef Zieleniec and Stanislav  Daskalov told journalists today.    The Pact on Security and Stability in Europe was proposed by  French Premier Edouard Balladur in June 1993. It aims to ensure  stability and security in Europe and protect economic and trade  interests of European countries and to end in conclusion, by its  member states, of agreements on good neighborliness and on  respecting ethnic minority rights. According to the French  plan, European countries and the United States and Canada would  be signatories of the pact.    Daskalov said that Bulgaria considered every initiative  aimed  at stability in Europe profitable. He added, however, that the  prepared documents should put all countries on an equal footing.    Daskalov said that Bulgaria did not have problems either  with  borders or with ethnic minorities and it announced earlier that  it would not participate in round-table discussions on these  issues. Nevertheless it actively supports the preparation of the  Paris conference and hopes that the submitted document would  correspond to its interests, he added.    Daskalov told CTK that as far as the 800,000 Turks living in  Bulgaria are concerned Bulgaria believes that their rights had  been ensured in the course of last years' democratic changes.    In practice this issue had been successfully solved through  attracting the Turkish population to managing of the state, he  said. "It is important not only to demand that rights are  observed but to share responsibility," he said. Over one  hundred of mayors of Turkish origin had been elected during the  latest local elections, Daskalov said.    Moreover, the Movement for Rights and Freedoms, the third  strongest political party in Parliament, represented the Turkish  minority in Parliament, Daskalov said. He pointed to the fact  that Bulgarian Premier Lyuben Berov was a representative of this  very movement. "I do not know whether there exists another state  in Europe whose premier is a representative of a certain  minority group," Daskalov said.    He said that Bulgaria had settled problems in this field. If  it was not so then events similar to those in neighboring  Yugoslavia could happened in Bulgaria. On the contrary, thanks  to the fact that ethnic minority problems had been solved and  thanks to its moderate internal and foreign policy Bulgaria had  a certain stabilizing role in the Balkans, Daskalov said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Gaza City, Occupied Gaza Strip, April 14 (AFP)--The  Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) threatened Thursday [14  April] to carry out three more "surprise" attacks on Israeli  targets following the killing of 12 Israelis in two bus bombings.    "There are three more attacks to come," Hamas said in a  communique sent to AFP in Gaza City.    On April 7, a suicide bomber blew up a bus at 'Afula killing  seven Israelis and wounding 45 in the first attack to avenge the  mosque massacre of 30 Muslims by a Jewish settler in Hebron on  February 25.    Hamas said it was proud to claim responsibility in the name  of its armed branch 'Izz al-Din al-Qassam for Wednesday's attack  at Hadera that left five dead apart from the bomber and 30  wounded.    "The enemy prime minister (Yitzhaq) Rabin and his  chief-of-staff Ehud Baraq can expect three more surprises to  make them control the settlers," Hamas announced.    "The Hadera attack is another victory for 'Izz al-Din  al-Qassam's intelligence and security network," it boasted. "Our  hero got through all of Israel's security checks."    Israel "totally" sealed off the occupied territories after  the 'Afula bombing in a bid to halt more killings and announced  that security had been stepped up for Wednesday's memorial day  for fallen soldiers and independence day on Thursday.    Hamas warned Arabs living in Israel to keep away from public  places where Jews gathered. "We advise them not to get on  Israeli buses."    The communique also criticized PLO chairman Yasir 'Arafat  for  voicing regret at the murders. "'Izz al-Din al-Qassam swears by  God and the gun to defend our national rights."    [In a related report, Paris AFP in English at 0904 GMT on 14  April adds the following: "The young Hamas militant who died  carrying out the Hadera bus bombing had been arrested several  times for clashes with Israeli troops, residents of his home  village said Thursday.    ["They named the bomber as 22-year-old 'Amr Salih 'Amarnah  and said he was from the occupied West Bank village of Ya'bad,  east of Hadera where a bomb on a bus Wednesday killed five  Israelis and wounded 30.    ["Israeli troops had arrested 'Amarnah several times,  villagers told AFP.    ["Police said the assailant in the Hadera bombing, which  coincided with Israel's memorial day for its soldiers who have  fallen in battle, came from the West Bank but did not name him.    ["They said he had also placed a second bomb in the Hadera  central bus station, timed to explode 90 minutes after the first  blast and at a time when Israelis observed a minute of silence  for their fallen soldiers.    ["Explosives experts blew up the second bomb."]    [In another related report, Paris AFP in English at 0915 GMT  on 14 April adds the following: "Hamas spokesman Ibrahim  Ghawshah, in an interview published Thursday, said the group was  ready to halt deadly attacks on civilians inside the Jewish  state if Israelis stopped `killing our children.'    ["`The principle of reciprocity is the same everywhere,' he  told the London-based Arabic newspaper AL-HAYAH.    ["`When Rabin stops killing our children and our women,  Hamas  will stop attacking civilians and it will target only troops and  settlers,' the spokesman said.    ["`The shabab (youths) of the intifadah will do miracles and  will prove that the Israeli army is a paper tiger,' Ghawshah  warned.    ["He also blasted 'Arafat for expressing regrets. `The blood  of Palestinian children and women is not cheaper than the blood  of Israeli civilians,' he said."]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Luiz Caversan] </F>   [Text] Varig [Rio Grande do Sul Airline] -- the most  important Brazilian airline, and the largest in South America --  yesterday announced it was suspending payments, for two months,  on its "leasing" [preceding word in English] contract (rent with  purchasing preference) on 50 of its planes. Varig President  Rubel Thomas made the announcement in Rio de Janeiro.    Varig has grounded 80 of its planes, including Boeing and  Mcdonnell-Douglas planes -- 50 of which are under "leasing"  contracts. Thomas said the suspension of payments while  contract periods and values are being renegotiated (which will  be conducted by the Bankers Trust) is within the company's  reorganization plan. The company has been accumulating losses  since 1990. Last year it lost $380 million.    Varig pays $500 million for its planes annually. The  two-month postponement will save $83 million. Thomas did not  say exactly who the creditors are -- mentioning only that they  are Japanese, Americans, and Europeans -- or how much it is owed  to each. He said the payment due in March, which should have  been deposited today, will not be made.    Thomas said the company has two types of "leasing"  contracts:  Operational contracts (with the manufacturer or its  representative and includes a cash deposit), and financial  contracts (the guarantee is the plane itself). Seventy percent  of Varig's contracts are financial and 30 percent are  operational (with deposits totaling $100 million).    Rubel Thomas said there are two reasons for "calling  creditors for talks." He said the first is that currently  "there is a large international offer of `leasing' contracts,  and prices have dropped significantly. We are paying prices  that were agreed when rates were much higher, and we need to  renegotiate."    Second reason: In 1993 Varig had revenues of almost $2.5  billion, of which only 19 percent, or $460 million, was  available to cover investment costs. This is "insufficient to  cover our investments," which total $500 million, Thomas said.    The Varig president said the company will delay payments for  only two months. "Our domestic commitments will not be affected  at all," Thomas said, adding that the 60 day period might even  be reduced. "We want to conclude the negotiations as quickly as  possible."    This type of maneuver is not common in Brazil, but Thomas  stressed that difficulties have forced various foreign companies  to renegotiate. He mentioned, among others, United Airlines,  Continental, and SAS [Scandinavian Airlines System]. "Evergreen,  for instance, is doing what we are doing now," he said.    "We will pay everything we owe and maintain all our  commitments," Thomas stressed, recalling that during the 67  years of Varig's existence the company "always honored its  commitments." Thomas said: "Negotiations will be tough but  necessary. I am convinced we are doing something serious and  looking after the interests of shareholders and customers."</p>

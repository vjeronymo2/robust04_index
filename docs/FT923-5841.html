			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Charterail signals poor outlook for BR sell-off: Collapse is a setback for private-sector trains LAST night's collapse of Charterail, the private company that set out to pioneer the transfer of freight from Britain's roads to its railways, is more than just bad news for the environment. It also paints a gloomy picture of the prospects for railways after privatisation. The root of the problem is the difference between the methods of charging for use of roads and rail. For a lorry operator starting up a freight service, the cost of using the roads - basically road tax and fuel duty - is a relatively minor factor. For a train operator, payments for use of the railway infrastructure typically represent more than half the costs. When Charterail was formed in 1990 it looked an exciting way of getting freight back on to the railways. Specially developed road and rail wagons enabled road trailers to be hauled to the railhead and driven directly on to swivel-action rail wagons without the need for costly lifting equipment. The idea was to provide a door-to-door distribution service of the sort that had become uneconomic for British Rail. Trailers could be collected from customers, driven to railheads, transferred to rail for the long-distance part of their journey, then delivered by road at the other end. Charterail, owned 22 per cent by BR and 78 per cent by the private sector, started by taking over a BR contract to deliver pet food from the Pedigree Petfoods plant in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, to London. This year it launched its first new service, a daily overnight train in each direction between London and Scotland, serving more than a dozen customers. Its costs, however, were largely out of its control. Locomotives, crews and access to the railway tracks were all provided by BR, and had to be paid for. Charterail says it had expected BR to reap productivity gains as services grew and to pass them on to Charterail in the form of lower prices. It did not. Nor, as recession deepened, was BR prepared to cut its rates to preserve Charterail's competitive position against road hauliers. In the end Charterail simply could not afford to go on. Some backers were prepared to put more money into the business if BR would lower its rates and put more money up as well. But yesterday BR refused to do either, and Charterail's directors pulled the plug. The question remaining is what this says about any private-sector rail company's ability to run trains profitably. Under the privatisation plan currently proposed, BR will remain in ownership of all Britain's railway tracks after privatisation. It will also continue to employ most of the drivers and own most of the trains, renting them out to prospective train operators such as Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Group. If, however, BR is convinced that the lowest commercial rates it can charge for trains or tracks put the cost of operating them beyond the reach of the private sector, it is hard to see where the private entrants are going to come from.</p>

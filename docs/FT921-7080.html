			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Vickers cuts it fine FT-SE Index: 2,559.7 (+17.4) The market's reaction to Vickers' results confirms the market's unhealthy preoccupation with dividends. Vickers' shares were marked up by over 4 per cent on the strength of a smaller than expected dividend cut. Last week, Shell's were marked down because its dividend increase did not quite match inflation: British Aerospace's rose on relief that its dividend was maintained. Admittedly the reaction to both British Aerospace and Vickers suggests the market has discounted a lot of bad news on dividends, so the downside risk from here could be limited. But the problem with the dividend obsession is twofold. Companies are encouraged to pay too much because they are worried about the market's immediate reaction. The market is tempted to value shares on short-run dividend performance rather than underlying earnings prospects. While there are still several questions over British Aerospace's future, Vickers' case is less moot. Gearing is low, and the defence business is doing well thanks to the Challenger order. But there is no real prospect of an end to the slump in demand for Rolls-Royce cars. Nor has Vickers yet found a partner to share Rolls-Royce development costs. Doubtless that will continue to detract from the recovery prospects of the shares.</p>

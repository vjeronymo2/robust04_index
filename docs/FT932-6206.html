			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Mining group quits race for pits YOUNG GROUP, the independent mining company, yesterday said it would not compete for 20 pits British Coal is putting out to tender. The company was previously thought to be one of the likeliest bidders. The leases of the first four were advertised yesterday - Easington, Bolsover, Cotgrave and Silverhill - although there are likely to be few bidders. Mr Brian Calver, chief executive of Young Group, said: 'We do not think there is sufficient market.' Mr Calver added: 'It is reasonable to suppose British Coal knows what it is doing and is getting rid of the 20 with the worst assets and the least chance of winning markets. We ought to be able to run at lower costs than British Coal but not to that degree.' The first four are among the least attractive of the 20 pits British Coal is putting out to tender over the next few weeks. Bolsover in Derbyshire has virtually no reserves left. The advertisements come at the end of a week which has confirmed how difficult it will be for any mining organisation, in the public or private sector, to find a market for coal. In response to a British Coal offer to provide subsidised coal at less than two thirds of production costs, National Power, the main electricity generator and the largest consumer of coal in the UK, said it would only consider how much coal to take in the autumn. Both National Power and PowerGen, the only other generator in England and Wales, have coal stocks more than three times higher than they want. If there were no political pressure on them they would buy no more than they have already contracted for. Young Group is saving its energies for the privatisation of British Coal in two to three years and may make a bid then. Mr Malcolm Edwards, former commercial director of British Coal, is considering bidding for some of the 20 but none of the first four. 'I do not think there will be a lot of players,' he said. Mr Richard Budge, chief executive of RJB Mining, will be pleased if that remains the case. He said yesterday that he would bid for the licence to run Easington. Easington, sunk in 1899, was one of the last two pits in the Durham coalfield when it ceased production this month. In 1947, when the industry was nationalised, Durham had 128 collieries employing 108,000 men. Easington produced 1.3m tonnes of coal last year, which Mr Budge said was of 'beautiful quality' and could be sold into the domestic and industrial markets. He plans to bid for up to 11 pits in the belief that British Coal's concentration on the electricity supply market leaves gaps in other markets. RJB will have its work cut out if it wins the Easington licence. According to John T. Boyd, the US consultancy, Easington had the least potential of 21 pits it inspected last year as part of the government's review of its pit closure plans.</p>

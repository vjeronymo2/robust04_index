			<p>BFN     [Text] Public security organs throughout the province have  brought the role of discipline inspection, supervision, and  auditing departments into full play; persisted in managing  police forces strictly; strengthened legal inspection; strictly  enforced auditing rules and regulations; and exercised strict  supervision over everything; thus achieving phased results in  their anticorruption struggle. During the struggle, among  public security personnel across the province, 343 cadres at the  county and section levels and 204 county and city public  security bureau directors and political commissars earnestly  conducted self-examination and self-correction. Anticorruption  reporting telephone lines were installed; 308 submissions of  anticorruption cases were handled; 170 police officers and men  were seriously investigated and punished; the unhealthy  practices of wantonly collecting fees, fines, and apportionments  was severely curbed; 20 wanton-collection items were scrapped;  excessively collected fees amounting to 430,000 yuan were  returned to their owners, while fees amounting to 640,000 yuan  were turned to the state treasury; and 169 companies and  economies entities of various types operated by public security  organs were cleared up and rectified, or were disbanded and  decoupled from the public security organs. The province also  set up 158 law enforcement and inspection teams to earnestly  conduct a mass law enforcement survey and solve problems  cropping up in the course of law enforcement, such as bending  the law for the benefit of relatives or friends, bending the law  out for personal considerations, not being strict in enforcing  laws, and not enforcing laws impartially, thus putting an end to  the unhealthy practices of engaging in smuggling, protecting  smuggling, and seizing smugglers or smuggled goods by  overstepping their authority.    Auditing and supervision departments have served not only as  guardians for economic management, but also as doctors for money  management. Since 1989, they have halted and corrected  discipline violations involving a total amount of 13.46 million  yuan and have increased revenues amounting to 320,000 yuan by  saving losses and waste, thus promoting public security organs  to use their limited funds where they were needed most.</p>

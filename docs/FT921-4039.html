			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (News): Chancellor signals start of unified bulletin - Statements Change MR Norman Lamont yesterday rose uniquely to the occasion of the Budget ceremony by announcing that, after next year, the ceremony will cease to exist. The chancellor said that the time-honoured exercise of dealing with taxation and spending in two separate government statements will be replaced by a unified annual budget. Sounding the death knell for well over a century of British economic tradition, Mr Lamont said the first overall fiscal statement combining tax and spending would come in December 1993. This would bring together in a single form the decisions at present dealt with separately in the March Budget and a November Autumn Statement. Rather like the switch to decimal coinage in 1971, the move ends an endearingly arcane British custom and brings the UK into line with most industrialised and developing countries. Since Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, has also promised to end the separation of tax and expenditure decisions, yesterday's announcement appears final. Although, after 1993, Budget Day may never be the same, the Treasury yesterday brushed aside any idea that the whole procedure would be scrapped. The wooden Budget box bearing Queen Victoria's monogram in gold letters - which dates from Gladstone's day - looks likely to remain an essential accompaniment. 'A lot of the trappings will be the same. Whoever he is, the chancellor will want to have his big day,' the Treasury said. The decision, which has been under active discussion within the Treasury for more than a year, is intended to improve policy presentation and improve decision-making. The present system was first set down by Sir Robert Walpole in the 18th century, and refined by Gladstone in 1860. Mr Lamont said it was not only 'illogical' but also had 'undesirable consequences'. Separation of tax proposals from expenditure had contributed to Britain's 'excessively complex tax system'. Momentum towards ending the practice has been building up since it was criticised in the early 1980s by the Armstrong committee on budgetary reform and by the Treasury and the Civil Service Committee. The move was given a warm welcome yesterday in the City. Bringing together the two halves of fiscal policy was termed 'eminently sensible' by Mr Nigel Richardson, an economist at merchant bankers SG Warburg. Under Mr Lamont's proposals, the annual December fiscal statement would contain tax plans for the coming fiscal year as well as expenditure plans for the three years ahead. The date of the annual Finance Bill would be brought forward from April to January.</p>

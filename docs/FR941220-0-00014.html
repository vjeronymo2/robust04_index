			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Requirements for the Plan of Care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We set forth the criteria that would have to be met in order for the plan of care to be considered acceptable. We addressed:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Those items that must be contained in the plan of care.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The specificity of the physician's orders for services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The timing of review of the plan of care.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The termination of the plan of care.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Requirements for Qualifying Skilled Services To Be Covered and Billable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We described the overall nature of the services that must be furnished for the care to be considered skilled care and the general concepts under which a decision regarding whether the services are reasonable and necessary should be made.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. Dependent Services Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We proposed that the services listed below would be covered only if the beneficiary had a need for at least one of the qualifying skilled services. We also proposed requirements, based on the statute or long-standing policy, that these services must meet in order to be covered by Medicare.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Home health aide services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Medical social services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Occupational therapy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Durable medical equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Medical supplies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Services of interns and residents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> G. Allowable Administrative Costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We proposed that, in general, payment for certain services would be made as an administrative cost.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> H. Place of Service Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We proposed, for purposes of Medicare coverage of home health services, that a beneficiary's home is any place in which a beneficiary resides that does not meet the definition of a hospital, skilled nursing facility (SNF), or nursing facility as defined in sections 1861(e)(1), 1819(a)(1), or 1919(a)(1) of the Act, respectively.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We proposed that for services to be covered in an outpatient setting, they had to require equipment that could not be made available in the beneficiary's home or were services that were furnished while the beneficiary was at the facility to receive services requiring equipment that could not be made available in his or her home. We proposed that an outpatient setting might include a hospital, SNF, rehabilitation center, or outpatient department affiliated with a medical school, with which the HHA has an arrangement to provide services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> I. Number of Visits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We proposed that all Medicare home health services would be covered under Part A if the beneficiary had Part A entitlement and, if the beneficiary had only Part B entitlement, under Part B. We proposed that, if all coverage requirements were met, payment could be made for an unlimited number of covered visits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> J. Excluded Services  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We specified that certain items would be excluded from coverage as Medicare home health services:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Drugs and biologicals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Transportation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Services that would not be covered as inpatient hospital services. (Note: Although we discussed this proposed provision in the preamble of the proposed rule, it was inadvertently omitted from the proposed regulation text).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Housekeeping services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Services covered as end stage renal disease services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Prosthetic devices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Medical social services provided to family members.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> K. Condition of Participation: Clinical Records  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We proposed that the discharge summary, including the patient's medical and health status at discharge, must be sent to the attending physician.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

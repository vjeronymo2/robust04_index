			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Europe tries again on single stock market STOCK exchanges in the European Community have agreed to look again at ways of creating a single European stock market, 18 months after their last initiative collapsed in disarray. Co-operation between the exchanges would make it easier for investors to trade in European stocks outside their domestic market, relieving them of the need to trade on each domestic exchange. The Federation of Stock Exchanges in the EC said yesterday it had set up a working group to 'consider the options for the evolution of an efficient European securities market'. This was taken as a sign that the exchanges have overcome much of the disagreement, which led to the scrapping of their last initiative, known as Euroquote, in July last year. Disagreement at that stage centred on the type of market that should be built. Some countries, such as the UK, wanted a wholesale market for large investors while others, led by France, believed the market should be for retail investors who want to trade small volumes of shares. The exchanges are understood to have agreed now to focus on a wholesale market. A blueprint for the market already exists in London, but other European exchanges have balked at the idea of granting the London market official recognition as the European wholesale market.</p>

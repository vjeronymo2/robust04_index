			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / UK Company News: CE Heath to float Australian subsidiary IN A move signalling its intention to concentrate on international insurance broking, CE Heath, the listed UK broker, yesterday announced the flotation of its long-established Australian underwriting business. The group hopes to generate about ADollars 108m (Pounds 44m) via the sale of 72m shares in CE Heath International Holdings, its Australian subsidiary, representing about 45 per cent of the company's enlarged capital. The money is to be used to repay debt and fund the Australian subsidiary's expansion. Mr Peter Presland, chief executive, accepted that the flotation - which will reduce HIH's contribution to Heath's profits - would be dilutive, which was one of the reasons for a negative response from the market which marked the shares down 21p to 418p. After the flotation, which should go ahead in May, Heath aims to retain a 44 per cent holding in the enlarged venture, with HIH management holding 11 per cent. With long term investment in mind Heath will purchase from HIH its shareholding in Trade Indemnity - representing 5 per cent of the issued share capital - for Pounds 7.4m cash. In addition Heath will purchase from HIH its 80 per cent holding in Lloyds New York Insurance Group for Pounds 3.3m cash. Some ADollars 45.2m of the proceeds are to earmarked to finance the expansion of HIH, which specialised in commercial liability business. ADollars 5m is to be allocated for the expenses of the flotation, ADollars 40m to repay bank debt and ADollars 17.8m to repay inter-company debt. Ord Minnett Securities, the Australian stockbroker, will manage and underwrite the flotation. The deal is subject to shareholders' approval. In the year to December 31 HIH earned unaudited pre-tax profits of ADollars 24.6m on gross premium income of ADollars 365.7m. HIH directors forecast a pre-tax profit of ADollars 43.7m for 1992, on the assumption that the flotation goes ahead without any hitches.</p>

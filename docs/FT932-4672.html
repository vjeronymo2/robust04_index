			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Critchley moves ahead to Pounds 3.05m CRITCHLEY GROUP, the electrical cable accessories manufacturer which came to the market in November, increased pre-tax profits by 35 per cent over the year to March 31. Strong demand in the UK and overseas, coupled with the acquisition of EPC Identification Systems of the US in April last year, helped lift profits to Pounds 3.05m (Pounds 2.26m). Turnover increased 24 per cent to Pounds 24m (Pounds 19.2m) of which Pounds 1.89m was attributable to EPC. Overseas sales accounted for 43 per cent. Earnings per share rose 25 per cent to 19.1p (15.3p) out of which a 4.8p dividend is proposed. The core electrical cable accessories and identification products business increased sales 26 per cent to Pounds 17.4m (Pounds 13.8m) and operating profit 14.5 per cent to Pounds 2.54m (Pounds 2.22m). New products, particularly HSI, the computerised wire marking system which is now Critchley's biggest seller, and sale of cable accessories manufactured in LFH (Limited Fire Hazard) plastic materials, made 'good contributions.' Main customers in the UK for these products include thepower generation, oil and gas, and rail industries. Direct exports from the UK rose 21 per cent mainly reflecting strong demand for specialist products. Mr Chris Humphrey, finance director, said margins were 'fractionally' higher. The group's two other companies, Critchley Wound Components and Critchley Enclosures, both serving the electronics industry, also improved their performance. In April the group acquired the BT Label Centre for Pounds 1.5m cash. The business, subsequently renamed Critchley Label Centre, produces printed plastic identification labels for BT and a growing number of industrial users.</p>

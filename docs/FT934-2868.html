			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Graduate recruiters' university visits drop Graduate recruiters are abandoning the 'milk round' of visits to universities to recruit students as competition for jobs increases, careers advisers said yesterday. For every 100 bookings made with universities to meet students in 1990-91, only 38 were made this year, according to the Association of Graduate Careers Advisory Services. At the 'new' universities which were polytechnics until last year, there have been only 24 bookings this year for every 100 in 1990-91. Ms Margaret Wallis, president of the association, said employers wanted graduates who were prepared to take the initiative in looking for work. Releasing its survey of destinations for graduates in 1992, the association said total graduate unemployment had risen to 12.9 per cent, from 11.5 per cent the previous year. Employers in fact recruited more graduates in 1992; the increased unemployment rate was caused by a rise of 9.7 per cent in graduate numbers. But the survey shows those pupils who leave schools in England and Wales with A-levels are twice as likely as graduates to be unemployed. What Do Graduates Do?

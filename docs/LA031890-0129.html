			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROSTENKOWSKI'S DEFICIT PLAN  </P> <P> Here we go again! Rostenkowski's proposal to "freeze" Social Security benefits  in 1991 (i.e., cancel the cost of living adjustment due that year) continues  the shameful deception of the public that has been going on for 20 years.  </P> <P> The Society Security Trust funds are running healthy surpluses at this time,  and the effect of the congressman's proposal will be to make them even larger.  Then, under the phony bookkeeping used by the government, this huge sum will be  subtracted from the budget deficit to make it appear to be smaller than it  actually is!  </P> <P> LEO KLAVENS  </P> <P> Westlake Village  </P></p>

			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Accelerated downtrend for German carmakers A MIXED day for bourses saw Swiss shares easier in spite of a rate cut, Spain still unhappy about measures to protect the peseta, and more pain for German carmakers as investors broke off their recent love affair, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT's carmakers accelerated their downtrend, BMW losing DM29 to DM485 for a fall of 12.1 per cent on the week so far, Daimler by DM30.30 to DM597.70 for 8.2 per cent and Volkswagen by DM11.50 to DM295 for a four-day fall of 8.1 per cent. The DAX index fell 26.89, or 1.7 per cent on the day to 1,530.94. Paribas Capital Markets said that Deutsche Bank was reported to be downgrading BMW and Daimler by around 5 per cent and VW by 10-15 per cent; Dresdner said that it was recalculating its figures to incorporate exchange rate problems; and, in London, James Capel put out a sell note on BMW. Turnover rose from DM4.9bn to DM5.1bn. Banks, again, held up much better than average. Deutsche Bank closed at DM656, down DM5.50 on the day and on the week. Even more interest rate-sensitive, Bayernhypo and Bayernverein rose another DM1 and DM1.50 to DM394 and DM411 respectively, up DM7 and DM4 on the past four days. MADRID fell to its lowest level since December 1986 as foreign investors sold heavily following the reintroduction of currency controls on Wednesday. The general index lost 7.07 or 3.4 per cent to 198.15 while the Ibex was 3.8 per cent weaker. Turnover swelled to some Pta17bn. Analysts agreed that there was a massive capital outflow as foreign institutions sold positions and traders were anticipating another choppy day today. PARIS stabilised as pressure on the franc eased slightly after several days of turbulence. The CAC-40 index closed just 0.57 ahead at 1,829.50 after a day's high of 1,853.17. Among the session's movers Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez lost FFr21 or 3.9 per cent to FFr510 after warning that second half earnings would be affected by weakness in the property sector. Lafarge Coppee gained FFr10 to FFr289 on better-than-expected figures while Michelin improved FFr5.50 to FFr201.50 following a meeting with analysts. Saint-Louis closed down FFr55 or 4.7 per cent at FFr1,095 on a fall in first half earnings published after Wednesday's close. MILAN fell victim to anxiety about interest rates, and a 2.58 rise to 367.12 in the Comit index was replaced by a 1.3 per cent drop, in lira terms, in the Italian component of the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 index in the London afternoon. Sip, after Wednesday's 14 per cent increase in first half gross profits, fell L12.1 to L969.4 on worries that it could be hit by political wrangling over the future of the telecommunications sector, and the proposed 0.75 per cent tax on corporate net assets. Fiat fixed L43 higher at L3,621, but retreated to L3,565 on the kerb ahead of more than halved pre-tax profits for the first half of 1992. Cir, Mr Carlo De Benedetti's holding company, tumbled L47.5, or 5 per cent to L904.3 on worries about the outlook for Olivetti, its main unit, which fixed L25 lower at L1,715 and fell to L1,680 on the kerb. AMSTERDAM ended flat as a predicted further interest rate cut by the central bank failed to materialise. The CBS Tendency index closed unchanged at 113.1. Nedlloyd finished down Fl 1.20 at Fl 35.50 with news coming during the session that Mr Torstein Hagen had won a court ruling enabling him to take his seat on the board of the transport group. A negative analysts' meeting left DSM down Fl 2.70 at Fl 24.60 while news of improved prospects for Philips' CD-I system lifted the shares 40 cents to Fl 24.60. VIENNA eased slightly as the impetus from Wednesday's cut in the money market intervention rate faded. The ATX index ended down 7.94 at 828.11. Vienna Airport went against the trend, rising Sch42 to Sch498 after reporting a 56 per cent increase in first half net profits. STOCKHOLM scored a 16.8 per cent rise in the banks and finance index, encouraged by a government pledge to build a safety net under the country's shaky financial system. S-E-Banken, which faces a SKr1bn loan exposure to the troubled bank holding group, Gota, was the day's winner, the restricted A rising SKr2 to SKr12.5. Handelsbanken B rose SKr3 to SKr26. However, other shares were mixed to lower and the Affarsvalden General index eased 0.30 to 708.90. Professionals noted, meanwhile, that the banks and finance index had fallen by more than 70 per cent this year before yesterday's recovery.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - SEP 24  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                           Hourly changes  Open     10.30am  11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close 1046.29  1045.30  1042.91  1042.02  1042.48  1042.51  1040.60  1041.31  -----------------------------------------------------------------------       Day's High  1047.51                Day's Low  1039.35  -----------------------------------------------------------------------      Sep 23       Sep 22       Sep 21       Sep 18       Sep 17     1043.77      1044.34      1050.43      1070.95      1058.13  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

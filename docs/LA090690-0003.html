			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAMPAIGN WATCH;  </P> <P> LUNGREN'S MURKY AD  </P> <P> Republican candidate Dan Lungren kicked off the race for state attorney general  with a controversial ad campaign that is murky and exploitative.  </P> <P> The radio and TV commercials accuse Lungren's Democratic opponent, San  Francisco Dist. Atty.  </P> <P> Arlo Smith, of going soft on crime by accepting a plea bargain in a rape and  drug case involving wealthy businessman Donald E. Werby.  </P> <P> The commercials, which on radio sound like a news report, are misleading in  their omission of some key facts. Werby was indicted by a grand jury for having  sex with teen-age prostitutes, dispensing cocaine to minors and attempted  bribery. The real estate tycoon pleaded guilty to reduced charges and was  sentenced to three years probation, nine months of community service and  ordered to pay a $300,000 fine to a program for runaway youths.  </P> <P> Lungren's TV ads say, "This, after Werby and his brother had given thousands to  Smith's political campaign." The implication is the money bought Werby a better  deal. In fact, Smith returned the money before the plea bargain.  </P> <P> "I am not embarrassed by the ad, but I am sorry there is some  misinterpretation," Lungren said. The ads now read, "Although Smith returned  Werby's political contribution, he should have turned the case over to the  state attorney general because of potential conflict of interest."  </P> <P> Smith's record of plea bargaining and convictions is a legitimate and serious  issue. Lungren's commercial only trivialized it.  </P></p>

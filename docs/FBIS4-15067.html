			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yevgeniy Spiridonov (ADS) report in the "Military </F> Industrial Complex" column: "The State Defense Industry  Committee (Goskomoboronprom) Warns That Defense Is Weakening.  Enterprises Do Not Want To Fill Military Orders at Their Own  Expense"]    [Text] If the government allocates a mere 5.5 trillion  rubles [R] for defense, arms, and military hardware production  while at least R28 trillion is required to maintain Russia's  defense capability, a decision should be made to abolish the  military order in principle because the funds allocated will  barely be enough to cover defense enterprise debts, and will  secure standby status for the space and nuclear forces. This  was announced by Yuriy Glybin, Goskomoboronprom's first deputy  chairman, at a joint session of Goskomoboronprom and the State  Duma's Committee on Industry, Construction, Transport, and Power  Engineering leadership held at the defense industries  headquarters on 4 April.    Mr. Glybin complained that in order to offset the cost of  arms and military hardware production, unpaid by the Defense  Ministry, defense industry enterprises have to seek credits from  commercial banks and repay them out of their profits received  from marketing civilian goods. Last year, for example, no more  than 30 percent of enterprises in the defense sector were  solvent, mainly because, Yuriy Glybin believes, they had to pay  R400 billion from their profits to repay commercial credits on  defense orders. The Defense Ministry still owes the enterprises  R870 billion. Naturally the enterprises are refusing to credit  state defense expenditures, and by the end of March, for  instance, they have signed merely 35 percent of contracts sought  by customers.    Vitaliy Vizirov, chief of Goskomoboronprom's Main Science,  Technology, and Conversion Directorate, said in particular that  in the military aviation sector only 17 aircraft are to be  manufactured -- half of an annual production program of one  enterprise. Last year, he said, not a single new military  equipment or weapon prototype was developed. A mere 3 to 7  percent of the requisite funds is allocated to continue the  building of warships, so they will take some 20 years to  complete. Armor production capacities are also operated at 8 to  10 percent.    Yelena Novikova, chief of Goskomoboronprom's General  Economic  Directorate, stated that with the defense expenditures  envisioned under the 1994 draft budget, one should think not  about filling the military production order but about closing  and converting, in a civilized way, nearly one-third of defense  enterprises so as not to leave 1.4 million people without the  means of livelihood.    The meeting closed without any specific decisions or  political statements although some parliamentarians were ready  to raise the question of whether the situation within the  military industrial complex has not come about a result of high  treason on the part of the executive branch. At any rate, the  parliamentarians promised the defense industry their support in  discussing the draft budget in the State Duma on condition that  the latter "put an end to political inaction."</p>

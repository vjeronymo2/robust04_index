			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Survey of Vietnam (3): Communism losing its lustre - Party membership is no longer seen as the only path to prosperity Their eyes flicking restlessly to and fro, the plainclothes policemen watching the Buddhist monks at the Linh Mu pagoda are easily identified among the foreign tourists and Vietnamese souvenir hawkers on the banks of the Perfume River. They are watching with good reason. In May, the dozen monks at this pagoda on the outskirts of the old imperial capital of Hue were at the centre of the most serious threat to the authority of the Vietnamese Communist Party for many years. The trouble began when a man committed suicide at the temple by dousing himself with petrol and setting himself ablaze. The monks, belonging to the Unified Buddhist Church which has long resisted incorporation into the official church sanctioned by the government, said the dead man was a devout Buddhist; the authorities said he had problems with his wife. When Thich Tri Tuu, the abbot, was taken away for questioning about the incident, about 1,000 people staged a demonstration on a bridge in the centre of Hue. A government car was overturned and set on fire before the security forces dispersed the crowd. Four monks, including the abbot, were among those subsequently arrested. They were sentenced to 3-4 years in jail at a trial in November, according to news agency reports from Hanoi. The unrest appears to have spread from central Vietnam to the south, and the head of a pagoda near Vung Tau has also been arrested. 'There is no freedom of religion,' said one of the grey-robed monks at the Linh Mu pagoda recently. 'We are trying to develop Buddhism among the people, and most people are Buddhists, so the government is scared. Buddhism does not fit in with Marxism-Leninism . . . It is hard for both Catholics and Buddhists.' Supporters of the government and western diplomats say the monks have links to south Vietnamese anti-communists. Yet it was from this pagoda that a monk went to Saigon (now Ho Chi Minh City) in 1963 to perform a much publicised act of self-immolation in protest against the persecution of Buddhists by Ngo Dinh Diem, the South Vietnamese president then confronting the Communist north. Opinion is divided as to the seriousness of the threat to the government's authority posed by the Hue demonstration. The rise of religious feeling is certainly regarded as more significant than the feeble anti-communist plots organised by dissatisfied south Vietnamese living in exile in the US that are occasionally uncovered by the government. The interior ministry and the security forces maintain a tight grip on the country. Asked about the demonstration, a Hue student said: 'The people had a fight with the police. The police won. They took photographs to make arrests. If anyone talks about the incident they go to jail.' In the countryside, where four fifths of Vietnam's people live, the party's control has been loosened by the collapse of agricultural co-operatives and the liberalisation of the rice trade. In the towns, which have an estimated 3.5m unemployed, but no organised opposition to the government has emerged. 'I don't see the Communist Party fading away in the Soviet sense,' says one western diplomat. 'It's secure as long as it controls the army. There is no urban intellectual dissidence.' Although it controls the levers of power, the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) - like communist parties everywhere - is floundering ideologically. Having adopted free market economic policies, it is communist only in its name and its political structure. By emphasising nationalism and pointing out that the party successfully rid Vietnam of the French and the Americans in the 1950s and the 1970s, the CPV can claim a measure of legitimacy and the support of much of the older generation for the one-party state. But half the population is under 20, and young men and women have no memories of French colonialism or the more recent war against the US and its south Vietnamese allies. In Hanoi, the CPV has sought to boost its dwindling popularity among the young by promoting such activities as a beauty pageant in the opera house and a beer festival in the Vietnam-Russia Friendship Palace, but with the economy being liberalised to allow the establishment of foreign and local private companies, membership of the party is no longer seen as the only path to prosperity and influence. The party's reputation, meanwhile, has been tarnished by the increased corruption that has accompanied economic reform and the leadership's inability to control its members in the provinces. When the communist people's committee in Ho Chi Minh City closed 44 of the city's 58 nightclubs this year, it emerged that the 14 remaining open were owned by the committee itself. Whereas many young Vietnamese either ignore the party or want it to loosen its grip, its ageing supporters complain that some of the good aspects of communism - free education, for example - have been thrown out with the bad. Perhaps the best argument that the CPV makes to justify its continued dominance is that it can ensure stability during this hectic period of economic transformation. Vietnamese leaders say that the communist states of eastern Europe were wrong to allow democratisation before reforming their economies, since the resulting anarchy made the introduction of coherent reforms all but impossible. Most Vietnamese and foreign business executives agree; the Vietnamese economy is growing fast to the benefit of the whole population. The disputes in Vietnam about the direction and pace of reform will be discussed at a forthcoming party conference, and the fact that the meeting has been put back from December to January indicates the intensity of political manoeuvring within the party's ranks. Coming in the middle of the CPV's seventh five-year congress, this mid-term review is the first of its kind in Vietnam, and students of communism have noted that similar conferences heralded the collapse of communist parties an the arrival of democracy in eastern Europe. In the absence of any serious contender for power, the immediate effects in Vietnam are unlikely to be so drastic. But Vo Van Kiet, the prime minister who is closely associated with the reform programme, will have a struggle on his hands as he tries to steer a course between those who favour faster liberalisation and hardliners fearful of change.</p>

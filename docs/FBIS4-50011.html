			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Yijun (1728 4135 0193)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 12 May (XINHUA) -- Premier Li Peng met with  Malaysian Prime Minister Mohamed Mahathir at the Ziguang  Pavilion of Zhongnanhai this afternoon. Both sides expressed a  willingness to peacefully resolve the Nansha [Spratly] Islands  issue through dialogue on the basis of friendly cooperation.    Li Peng extended a welcome to Mahathir for paying a working  visit to China and for participating in the 1994 China Beijing  international high-level economic forum.    During the meeting, both sides satisfactorily reviewed the  all-round and rapid development of bilateral relations since the  two countries established diplomatic relations 20 years ago, and  they said that they would work together to further develop  bilateral relations.    Li Peng said: After the end of the cold war, the world has  been developing in the direction of multipolarization. This is  the positive side, but many contradictions and problems exist  that need to be resolved.    He said: World affairs should be managed jointly by all  countries of the world. The practice of hegemony and power  politics will get one nowhere. All countries, big or small,  rich or poor, and strong or weak, are equal, and they should  enter into friendly cooperation. Disputes between nations  should be solved peacefully through consultation and dialogue on  a equal footing. It is necessary to establish a world political  and economic order that is just and reasonable. The United  Nations should do something more for the developing nations.    In discussing former Japanese Justice Minister Shigeto  Nagano's remark on the Nanjing Massacre, Li Peng said: Nagano's  remarks, which reversed black and white and distorted history,  show that there is a force in Japan which is attempting to  negate and beautify its history of aggression. Naturally, the  remarks were condemned by all Asian countries that suffered from  Japan's aggression.    He said: After Shigeto Nagano made his remarks, the Hata  administration has made many speeches and has taken some  measures.    Japanese Prime Minister Hata himself has conveyed an oral  message to Premier Li Peng. He expressed his regret over what  happened and reiterated that he will carry out a deep  self-examination on Japan's past aggression and colonial rule,  and that the young generation will be educated accordingly. Li  Peng expressed his appreciation for such efforts.    Li Peng said: Sino-Malaysian relations are very good. We do  not have any problems that need to be resolved urgently.    Commenting on the Nansha Islands issue, Li Peng said: "We  should resolve peacefully the issue through dialogue with  statesmen's farsightedness and friendly attitudes. Comrade Deng  Xiaoping proposed long ago that we should put aside disputes and  carry out joint development. We should explore and discuss the  issues with Malaysia based on the above principle."    Mahathir said: Both Malaysia and China are developing  countries which share many common points in dealing with both  regional and international affairs.    He indicated: Malaysia very much appreciates China's stand  of peacefully resolving the Nansha dispute and opposes the  internationalization of the Nansha issue. Malaysia is willing  to hold bilateral talks on the basis of friendly cooperation to  seek ways to resolve this issue.    Commenting on democracy, Mahathir expressed his belief that  we should respect the specific situations in various countries.  It is not commendable or feasible to apply the same democratic  concept to countries that are undergoing different stages of  development.</p>

			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Italians rush to retire Italian workers are rushing to take early retirement because of fears of sharp cuts in pension benefits in the 1995 budget. State pensions bodies have so far this year received retirement requests totalling 460,000, nearly double the number in the whole of 1993. The conservative government of prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, which has pledged to take action to reduce state spending and debts, has focused on the generous and much-abused pensions system. The government, which must present its 1995 budget to parliament before the end of this month, plans deficit cuts of at least L45,000bn (Pounds 18.5bn), including up to L9,000bn from pensions. Italians can retire on up to 80 per cent of their final salary. Italy has some 20m pensioners, just over one in three of the total population, with over a third of the state's total annual expenditure used to cover the cost, and payments far exceeding contributions.</p>

			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / People: 'Classic HR requirements' at SCA New Zealand is about as far away as you can get from Sweden, but it is to New Zealander Larry Simpson that the big Swedish pulp and paper group SCA has turned to make the highly unusual appointment of a foreigner to be group human resources director, writes Hugh Carnegy. Simpson, currently in charge of human resources in Europe and Africa for DHL, will leave his present base in Brussels later next month for Stockholm where, according to SCA information chief Sten Lindholm, he will be unique as a non-native personnel director in a big Swedish corporation. SCA counts one other foreigner - Briton Colin Williams - among the ranks of its top nine executives. He heads SCA Packaging, but is based in Brussels. Lindholm says SCA is looking to Simpson to bring a breadth of vision to the management of human resources in the group, which has been undergoing significant restructuring. Simpson, 45, took his time saying yes to the job. He was first approached a year ago. But he says he is 'very impressed' by the quality of his new Swedish colleagues - and attracted by life in the somewhat staid but beautiful city of Stockholm. 'Sixty five per cent of SCA's business is derived from outside Sweden so it is logical for them to have a mix of people at the top - to have a broad view and not just a Swedish view,' he says. He perceives some 'classic HR requirements' at SCA, including the development of senior management, recruitment, mobility of staff and pension and cost issues. Simpson has worked for 13 years for DHL, first in New Zealand, then in Singapore, before moving to Europe. He is looking forward to enjoying Sweden's ample opportunities for skiing and sailing. But his first priority is to learn Swedish - even if that is unlikely to be a real requirement in Stockholm where even most taxi drivers seem fluent in English.</p>

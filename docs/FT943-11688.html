			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Flying the flag crowds the air: The problem at the heart of airline competition To understand why air transport is one of the last industries to face the rigours of competition in Europe, a good starting point is Terminal 2, at London's Heathrow airport. From the spectators' gallery overlooking the European hub, the picture is clear. Spain's Iberia sits alongside Air France. Germany's Lufthansa follows the Dutch KLM carrier on to the runway. The blue insignia on the tail of Belgium's Sabena pokes out from behind Italy's Alitalia. 'The biggest barrier to air transport liberalisation in Europe is this crazy idea that every member state has to have its own airline,' said a European Commission official. The result is that a relatively small land-mass is supporting too many airlines. Europe's state-owned airlines occupy the same place as flags, languages and national anthems in the hearts of Europe's citizens. 'People still assume there is something glamorous about flying,' said the official. 'But. . . airlines are just glorified bus companies.' National pride more than anything explains why, six months after a Brussels committee urged Europe to speed up liberalisation of its airways, the Commission was yesterday unable to veto the last of three cases of state-aid to airlines to come before it this year - Air France, Greece's Olympic and TAT of Portugal. 'It wasn't really a question of what Brussels believed, it was a question of what it could get away with,' said an industry official yesterday. To the horror of private airlines without state subsidies, such as British Airways, and state-owned airlines that have restructured before privatisation, such as Lufthansa, the Commission allowed the French government to pump FFr20bn (Pounds 2.4bn) into the bankrupt Air France and the Greek government to inject Dr54bn (Pounds 147m) into Olympic. Earlier this month, the Portuguese Airline TAP was allowed to benefit from Es180bn (Pounds 723m) of government money. According to industry analysts, the decision to allow the French government and others to have their way is merely prolonging the agony for airlines that before long will have to face full-blown competition. 'FFr20bn is enough money to create a new airline from scratch,' said Mr Kevin Murphy, airline analyst at Morgan Stanley in New York. 'That kind of subsidy will only perpetuate the inefficiencies that already exist at Air France.' Yesterday the US administration made clear its dismay at the Brussels decision. 'In the late 1980s and early 1990s, when PanAm and Eastern Airlines went under,' said a US diplomat in Brussels, 'the US government resisted enormous pressure to intervene. In the long run, US carriers and consumers are better for it. The European Commission should have stood up to these subsidies in the same way.' The diplomat also noted that the Commission's conditions on state aid to Air France left the door open for further aid and were not tough enough to offset the 'negative and distortive effects' on competition. The decision, and the other state-aid approvals, formed part of Brussels' careful approach to liberalising this most sensitive of industries. Its conclusions - in what looked like an attempt to steer a course between the EU's liberalisers and more interventionist members  - argued that although privatisation was the implicit answer to the industry's woes, a restructuring period was necessary first. The most recent hand-outs were thus the so-called 'one time-last time' payments, which would allow carriers to get back on to a normal commercial footing before privatisation. The question now is how long the airlines can delay privatisation. The one condition that Air France's rivals would have liked to have seen imposed by the Commission would have been a definite date for privatisation. But none was set. Mr Bernard Bosson, the French transport minister gave a vague reassurance that privatisation would follow the three-year restructuring. 'What is happening now, is that everybody knows that the contraction of the airline industry is inevitable in Europe,' said the Commission official. 'Governments are trying to make sure that when the fight finally comes, their national carriers will be the ones that survive.' Until then - so far British Airways and British Midland remain the only EU 'flag-carriers' to operate entirely privately - consumers will remain the overall losers. According to the report on which the Commission's decision was based, European airlines' operating costs are about 48 per cent higher than those of their US counterparts and total labour costs nearly 37 per cent higher. In addition, global competition is hotting up. 'In the US, cost structures are coming down even further, and that will affect European carriers' competitive capability,' said Mr Murphy. 'It is obvious that not all the national carriers will survive,' Mr Peter Hobel of Lufthansa said yesterday. 'Some will just end up servicing regional traffic.'</p>

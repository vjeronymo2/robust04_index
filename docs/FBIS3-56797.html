			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kiev, 17 January -- The leadership of the State  Independence of Ukraine [DSU] association said the trilateral  agreement signed in Moscow proves that the policy of Ukraine's  President Leonid Kravchuk, aimed at Ukraine's unilateral  disarmament, is leading our state to a national disaster. This  was said in a DSU statement to Supreme Council Chairman Ivan  Plyushch.    "Despite our critical attitude to the composition of the  Supreme Council and some of its decisions, we cannot fail to see  that today it is a lesser evil compared to the presidential  structures," the statement stresses. The DSU sees Ukraine's  Supreme Council as an obstacle to the defeatist policy of  Ukraine's president and believes that after the current Supreme  Council is dissolved, Leonid Kravchuk will use the temporary  period of one-man rule to bring Ukraine to its knees with the  help of Clinton and Yeltsin.    The DSU reminds Plyushch that the decision to hold early  elections on 27 March was adopted in violation of the  Constitution, under the president's pressure. It calls on the  chairman of Ukraine's Supreme Council to initiate a proposal at  the next Supreme Council session to postpone the Supreme Council  elections to a later date. The date of the parliamentary  elections can be set to coincide with the next presidential  election or with the expiry of the current Supreme Council's  five-year term, the DSU believes.    During this time, according to the DSU, the Supreme Council  must approve a law on impeachment of the president of Ukraine  and apply it before the next elections.</p>

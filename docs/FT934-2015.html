			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / The GATT Deal: Period of drift comes to an end for European Union countries - Europe Amid the euphoria in Brussels yesterday, it was easy to exaggerate the immediate impact of a Gatt world trade deal on the European Union. A conclusion of the Uruguay Round will not cure the worst recession since 1974. The number of people out of work in Europe will still rise to nearly 20m next year. Once member countries see the fine print of the text agreed in the multilateral negotiations in Geneva, the bickering will begin again. But to dwell on these points is to miss the big picture. After a period of drift and paralysis, Europe has managed to settle its internal differences and act coherently on the world stage. A hard-fought Gatt agreement, in which Europe was seen to defend its vital commercial interest, may come to be viewed as a psychological turning-point, however much French brinkmanship tested the collective nerve. Europe has been trapped in crisis for the past 18 months, starting with the Danish rejection of the Maastricht treaty in June 1992. This was followed by the 'petit oui' to Maastricht in France, and, in August, the collapse of the European exchange rate mechanism, and the continuing civil war in former Yugoslavia. Divisions over trade were, potentially, more explosive. In the run-up to the December 15 deadline, diplomats in Brussels warned that failure to reach a Gatt deal could crack the Franco-German alliance which remains the anchor of the European Union, whatever its present strains. Export-dependent German industry was adamant that no amount of concern over 5m French farmers should sabotage a successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round. A Gaullist-led government in France, trapped by its aggressive election campaign rhetoric, warned that it would not countenance a deal which overrode its national interests. The stand-off within the EU - and the ensuing complications in negotiations with the US - risked a slide into 1930s-style protectionism and the end of a common European trade policy. A de facto split beckoned between 'northern liberals' including the UK, Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark, and a French-led protectionist-leaning rump including Greece, Spain, and Portugal. French demands for stronger European trade weapons mirror this division. For Germany and the UK, the principle that a free-trade leaning minority can use their combined voting weight to thwart trade retaliation dates back to the 1958 Treaty of Rome. For France and her allies, the question is whether Europe can punch her weight in international trade not just against the US and Japan, but also against the rising might of China and East Asia. At yesterday's meeting of foreign ministers in Brussels, a compromise on aspects of the trade weapons debate appeared in sight. 'If we can get a deal, it would end months of mutual suspicion,' said one diplomat. For the European Commission, a Gatt deal marks a second triumph in less than week, the first being the better-than-expected reception which heads of government gave to the white paper on employment, growth and competitiveness at the Brussels summit. For Sir Leon Brittan, the chief EU trade negotiator, it marks the progression from intellectual heavyweight to deal-maker on a grand scale and a serious candidate to succeed Mr Jacques Delors as Commission president. The difficulty now will be to keep up momentum. One senior EU official says that the current state of play in international trade resembles the political debate in Europe in the 1950s when states had to choose between a free trade area and strong institutional mechanisms to manage the customs union and harmonise economic policies. In this view, today's gains must be translated into tomorrow's lasting trade framework to cover exchange rate movements, the environment, competition, and social policy, including low wage labour.</p>

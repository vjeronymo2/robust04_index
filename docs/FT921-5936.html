			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / 'Category killer' strikes in Toyland TOYS 'R' US, the chain based in the US, has seized 18 per cent of the UK toy market in just seven years, according to a report, John Thornhill writes. Its performance highlights the impact of 'category killers' on retail markets. 'Category killers' are highly efficient distribution channels which sell a wide range of goods at discounted prices from low-cost edge-of-town superstores. Corporate Intelligence Group, a retail research company, found that Toys 'R' Us, which opened its first UK store in 1985, is the clear leader in the Pounds 990m toy market. Argos, the catalogue showroom retailer, is second with 14 per cent of the market followed by Woolworth, owned by Kingfisher, with 13 per cent. Other retail sectors appear vulnerable to such forms of competition. Ikea, the Swedish furniture group, has opened three big outlets in the UK and has slow but steady expansion plans. Nevada Bob, a US golf equipment retailer which runs six superstores in the UK, plans to open more than 40 further stores by 1995 with the aim of capturing 12 per cent to 15 per cent of the Pounds 500m market. Mr Robert Clark, director of Corporate Intelligence, said US 'category killers' succeeded because of the strength of their determination to win customers. 'They have a huge domestic market where they are first able to perfect their technique and build up sufficient financial strength to move across borders.' The report suggests that Toys 'R' Us will command more than 20 per cent of the UK toy market by the end of this year. The success of Toys 'R' Us plus the recession have led to the demise of a string of smaller toy retailers, the report adds. Retail Research Report 39.

On  Wednesday [2 March], the German Bundesbank stated that the M3  money supply in January -- after it was seasonally adjusted --  was superior to the average level of the fourth quarter 1993  with an annual rate of 20.6 percent.    Apart from the notes and coins in circulation, the money  supply M3 also includes sight deposits, time deposits with  maturities of less than four years, and savings deposits.  According to the Bundesbank, all these components grew rapidly  in January. "The pace of expansion was strongest for sight  deposits." For 1994, the Bundesbank is seeking a monetary  increase between 4 and 6 percent.</p>

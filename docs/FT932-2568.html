			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / S Korean steel executives held SOUTH KOREAN prosecutors have completed their corruption investigation of Pohang Iron and Steel (Posco), the country's main steel company, by arresting two company officials. They also claim that Mr Park Tae-joon, who established the state-controlled group 25 years ago and served as its chairman until last October, received a total of Won3.9bn (Pounds 3.2m) in bribes from subcontrac-tors and embezzled another Won79m. Mr Park fled to Japan after the government began an unprecedented tax audit of Posco in February. Mr Hwang Kyung-ro, who briefly succeeded Mr Park as chairman before resigning in April, was arrested on bribery charges along with Mr Yoo Sang-boo, a vice-president and former manager of plant construction. The presidents of two subcontractors who allegedly bribed the Posco executives have also been arrested. The probe of Posco, which is part of the new government's anti-corruption campaign, has been criticised as being politically motivated. Mr Park, a former senior official in the ruling Democratic Liberal party, last year opposed the presidential candidacy of Mr Kim Young-sam, who was elected last December. Posco is one of the few companies that has been extensively investigated by the new government on corruption charges. The results of the investigation have proved to be surprising since Mr Park was considered to be one of the country's most able businessmen, with a reputation for honesty. Mr Park, a former army general, was ordered by then military government in 1968 to create the nation's steel industry from scratch. Despite doubts that he would succeed, he transformed Posco into the world's third largest steel company and one that remains profitable while most of its main international competitors suffer losses. Mr Park was also a pioneer in providing social services to his workers, although his management style was criticised for being authoritarian.</p>

			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Arts: Peter Grimes - Opera in concert The high point of Mstislav Rostropovich's current Britten Festival at the Barbican was intended to be the two concert performances of Peter Grimes. Up to a point, the intention was realised. On Sunday, the excellence of the London Symphony Orchestra and Chorus was the ballast of the performance. Since the principal gain of such operas-in-concert is the host of opportunities offered for close-up examination of the score, the fine quality of the playing only enhanced admiration for the myriad fine detail of the music. A beautifully poised viola solo launching the Passacaglia offered a notable instance; so too the pithily characterful utterance of the Act 3 dance band, placed just close enough to allow the listener to note anew how subtly Britten worked its nippy pleasantries into the fabric of gathering dramatic tensions. A front-rank cast had been engaged: again, the pleasures of witnessing its most assured members in action fed one's admiration for the phrases Britten wrote for their characters. A singer's aim on such occasions should be the nicely judged infusion of characterisation into the smooth, clear delivery of notes. Such sharp-profiled singer-actors as John Dobson (Boles), John Connell (Swallow), Anne Collins (Mrs Sedley), Menai Davies (Auntie) and the sparky Jason Howard (Keene) - all experienced in the Grimes productions of Glyndebourne, ENO or Covent Garden - hit home their points with vivid economy. It was good to hear Ryland Davies taking a character role, the Rector, with such elegance. Platform entrances and exits added to the concert-drama - not, though, the addled boo-hoo-ing of the female chorus-member filling in for the boy apprentice. But the three principals, newcomers to their roles, revealed their inexperience in ways that sometimes rocked the concert-opera balance. Bryn Terfel's preening of his youthfully magnificent bass-baritone made only a superficial connection with Balstrode. Nancy Gustafson, dressed as a handsome West Coast belle with a glitter of diamonds in her hair, sang with a generalised warmth that too rarely found the centre of Ellen's precisely placed notes. It can be no easy matter to undertake one's first Grimes in the city where Peter Pears and Jon Vickers have held sway. The Canadian Ben Heppner, a heroic singer of uncommon intelligence, sensitivity and bounteous vocal gifts, struggled with those portions of the vocal writing most closely linked with Pears's tenorial idiosyncrasies. He will surely find his way deeper into the role, and should be fervently encouraged to do so - but, let us hope, under a conductor less far removed from the opera's 'real world' than Rostropovich. To be brutally frank, it seemed to me that on this showing, and for all the conductor's generosity and musicianly enthusiasm, he hasn't a clue of how Peter Grimes actually goes. Second Barbican Grimes concert tomorrow</p>

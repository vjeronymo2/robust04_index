			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Du Cann resigns from the Lonrho board SIR Edward du Cann, who last August stepped down as chairman of Lonrho, yesterday resigned as a director of the international trading group. A former chairman of the Conservative party, Sir Edward was forced to step down as chairman last year after the Department of Trade and Industry said it was applying to have him disqualified as a company director. It is understood that Sir Edward, aged 67, decided to resign as a director because he was not as fully occupied in his post as he was when he was chairman. There was also little possibility of him holding the Lonrho chair again. The DTI yesterday said the move to have Sir Edward disqualified - because of his involvement in Homes Assured, a mortgage broker which collapsed in September 1989 - was unlikely to come to fruition within the year.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 11 Apr (TANJUG) -- The ruling Socialist  Party of Serbia [SPS] today condemned the NATO attack against  the positions of the Srpska republic army and warned that it  could have immeasurable consequences on the escalation of the  war in former Bosnia-Herzegovina and on the stability in the  Balkans.    By committing the unannounced, treacherous April act, NATO  has sided with the Muslims in the civil war in former  Bosnia-Herzegovina, a statement by the SPS main committee says,  and adds that NATO forces directly helped the Muslim offensive  by military means and clearly declared their support to the  forces that favor war.    The SPS believes that this action instigates and encourages  the militancy of the Muslim side, and hardens their unrealistic  aspirations, which could put in jeopardy the peace process by  strengthening those who advocate the war option in solving the  Bosnian drama.    This action threatens all constructive approaches to find a  just solution through political negotiations and in a peaceful  manner and resumes the policy of pressure, which places the  sides in the conflict on an unequal footing, the statement says.    The SPS warns that this brutal act also represents a basis  for preserving and maintaining permanent instability in the  Balkans and that pressure, saber rattling, frequent border  provocations, and bombing are all integral parts of a scenario  for the escalation of the war in the area.    By giving cover to NATO for this act of aggression, the  United Nations is losing its credibility in the peace mission in  the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, the SPS main committee says and  concludes that by covering up and falsifying the facts, by  concealing the Muslim offensive, smuggling weapons to the Muslim  side, by making a decision to deploy Turkish forces in Bosnia,  and now by bombing the Serb positions -- the United Nations has  confirmed that it is a mere instrument in the hands of those  countries that want to achieve their interests and aspirations  in the Balkans by prolonging the war.    The SPS believes that the way out of this situation must be  sought through the prompt reaching of a truce in order to create  conditions for the resumption of negotiations, the SPS says.    The statement says that political negotiations are the only  way to reach a just and lasting solution to the conflict in the  former Bosnia-Herzegovina and appeals to those circles in the  international community who want peace in the Balkans to support  such efforts.</p>

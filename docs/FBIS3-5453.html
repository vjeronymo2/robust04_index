A delegation led by U.S. Deputy Assistant Trade  Representative Peter Collins met with Seoul officials for  negotiations focusing on intellectual property and opening the  South Korean market to American cars.    The talks opened just weeks before a report will be  submitted  to the U.S. Congress on the status of South Korea's intellectual  property rights protection. A final decision on whether to drop  South Korea from the priority watch list or label it as a  priority foreign country is due late next month.    Washington is demanding that Seoul continue to crack down on  violators and upgrade its laws to match those of the  trade-related intellectual properties (TRIPs) of the Uruguay  Round. For instance, a movie with an acknowledged copyright in  one country automatically receives the same copyright protection  in all other nations under the terms of TRIPs. South Korean law,  however, only recognizes a movie copyright from after 1987.  Seoul explained that it conducted a special crackdown on  violators in the January-October period last year, which helped  improve the situation.    On another front, Washington took issue with various  barriers  in South Korea when buying U.S. cars such as high tariffs and  the acquisition tax. U.S. officials also described what they  saw as psychological barriers, such as worries about a tax audit  when purchasing a foreign automobile. Seoul replied that it does  not erect such barriers and that its current 10 percent tariff  is not high compared with common international practice. It  explained the rate has already been lowered from 15 percent and  thus cannot be reduced further this year. The European union  also levies a 10 percent tariff on imported cars, South Korea  pointed out.</p>

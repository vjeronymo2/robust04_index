			<p>BFN     [Text] Hangzhou, April 19 (XINHUA) -- The Qinshan nuclear  power plant, the first designed and built by China itself, has  started commercial operation.    According to local officials, the power plant in coastal  Zhejiang Province, has so far generated 2.93 billion kwh of  electricity, and the waste gas, waste water and trash produced  are far below the limits set by the central government.    The officials attributed the achievement to the effective  measures adopted by the Qinshan nuclear power corporation.    For instance, the company has used TV, radio and exhibitions  to enhance consciousness of safety in production among workers  in a bid to ensure that the nuclear power plant operates safely  on a long-term basis.    The Qinshan nuclear power plant started full-load trial  operation in July 1992. Its construction began in 1985 and took  six years to complete.</p>

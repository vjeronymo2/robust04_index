			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Tough approach by Offer could cut power prices Domestic electricity prices could rise by significantly less than feared next year following indications by Offer, the industry regulator, that it will take a tough approach in reviewing the regional power companies' highly profitable distribution businesses. Some regional electricity companies said privately last night they would consider calling in the Monopolies and Mergers Commission if Professor Stephen Littlechild, Offer director-general, sticks to the policies he has indicated he favours in a confidential letter to them. Analysts say his policies could lead to prices, excluding tax, falling by up to 7 per cent from next April. This would go a considerable way towards alleviating the 9.5 per cent rise which will result from the increase in the rate of value added tax, scheduled to rise from 8 per cent to 17.5 per cent at the same time. Further price falls are likely. Prof Littlechild indicated that he expects distribution prices, which account for about a quarter of the final cost of electricity, to rise by 3 to 4 percentage points below the rate of inflation in future. Securities houses warned that if Prof Littlechild does not compromise, the companies could suffer a fall in earnings per share of up to 30 per cent in the year from next April, when the price controls are due to take effect. Shares in the regional electricity companies fell sharply yesterday after details of Prof Littlechild's letter leaked out. East Midlands Electricity, based in Nottingham, fell 27p to 571p, Bristol-based Sweb declined 23p to 595p and Yorkshire Electricity fell 22p to 587p. Several electricity company chief executives said Prof Littlechild's letter was merely an opening shot. 'It is not that much worse than we expected,' said one. 'He is bound to be open to compromise.' However, recent criticism of the regulatory system will encourage Prof Littlechild to adopt a settlement that will be seen as harsh on the companies. Negotiations on the distribution price review, promised by the government when the industry was privatised four years ago, have already been under way for several months, and are due for completion in July. Companies could challenge the outcome at the MMC before next April. In his letter, Prof Littlechild has suggested an appropriate rate of return on assets should be about 6 per cent. The companies' main concern is his suggestion that the assets could be calculated on market capitalisation shortly after privatisation, not on the cost of replacing current assets. Prof Littlechild indicated he will change the way prices are regulated. Existing controls relate maximum allowed revenue to volumes of power sold. Prof Littlechild has suggested that the revised formula should also be influenced by customer numbers and a fixed cost element. London stocks, Page 17 Lex, Page 26</p>

			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Survey of the UK Gas Market (1): Support for liberalisation gathers pace - Although political uncertainties continue to surround the planned opening of the UK gas market, Robert Corzine finds there is a growing belief that competition can be made to work Ten months have passed since the government gave the go-ahead for the planned liberalisation of the UK gas market, the fifth largest in the world and one of the fastest growing. But the subject has continued to spark off intense debate among industry executives, politicians and consumer groups. Last December, Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, brushed aside warnings from the Monopolies and Mergers Commission and approved a fast-track timetable for the full opening of the domestic gas market in 1998. It was high time, he said, that the 18m household consumers now served by British Gas had a choice of supplier. Officials from Ofgas, the industry regulator, spoke of a future in which a multitude of suppliers would emerge. Supermarket and department store chains, as well as credit card companies, might vie against the gas subsidiaries of leading oil companies and regional electricity companies for a share in the market. But by the summer, the brave new competitive gas world envisioned by the government and Ofgas was fast falling apart. The idea that millions of consumers (and voters) would soon be counting the cash saved as a result of introducing competition gave way to front page scare stories. 'Eight million face gas price hikes,' screamed the headlines. Ofgas fought a rearguard action to contain the damage, claiming that the end of uniform national prices would lead to only minor regional variations. It also gave assurances that the elderly and disabled would not suffer as a result of the introduction of competition. But the government's refusal to make a commitment to include a new Gas Act in this year's legislative programme merely added to the uncertainty. To many in the industry it looked as if government ministers had decided that gas competition was just too risky a project to embark upon so close to an election. Many now believe those dark days of summer have passed. In recent months support for liberalisation has gathered pace. British Gas now says it welcomes competition, and wants to see a new gas bill passed this year so that it has maximum freedom to restructure its businesses. Consumer associations say that they, too, want competition. Even the opposition Labour Party has said that it does not want to defend British Gas's monopoly. Although the government remains non-committal about whether gas will be included in the Queen's Speech in mid-November, there is growing confidence that some form of gas bill or government statement of support may be in the offing. But not all of the uncertainties raised during the summer have been swept away with the change of season. The concerns raised in recent months were enough to cause the Trade and Industry Select Committee of the House of Commons to focus its current round of hearings on gas liberalisation. Many of British Gas's would-be competitors are confident that the hearings will merely confirm that competition with adequate safeguards is the best way forward. But there is no certainty that competition will deliver the substantially lower prices and higher standards of service its proponents argue are attainable. Clare Spottiswoode, director general of Ofgas, is optimistic that gas deregulation will not mean higher prices, as some critics have contended. 'I don't see that anyone will lose as a result of competition,' she says. However, she admits that this is a 'leap of faith' on her part because there is no evidence from other countries to support her view. Indeed, it is the fact that no other large western industrialised country has embarked on a similar path which worries some of those charged with implementing the complex structural and technical changes in the industry required to make competition work. British Gas, for example, has asked for at least a six-month delay in the first phase of competition beginning in 1996. Executives at its TransCo pipeline subsidiary describe the current timetable as a 'high risk strategy'. They want more time to ensure that the new market-based mechanisms to balance the inflow and consumption of gas actually work. But even though uncertainties persist, the limited competition introduced so far and the prospect of a much more open market in the future have triggered dramatic changes within the UK gas industry. British Gas is undergoing a root-and-branch restructuring, one of the largest ever attempted in the UK, according to its executives. Within three years 25,000 jobs, a third of its workforce, will be gone and thousands of regional and district offices and high street retail shops will be closed. Senior management has also launched a cultural revolution to turn what has been one of the UK's most bureaucratic and hierarchical companies into one which Richard Giordano, chairman, says will be 'more dynamic and commercially astute'. Change is also the order of the day for the independent gas marketing companies which have blossomed in recent years in response to regulatory actions to promote limited competition in the mainly commercial and industrial markets. The independents, with low overheads, have easily undercut prices charged by British Gas, which until recently was barred by the regulator from offering discounts. They quickly captured 55 per cent of the mainly commercial market over 2,500 therms a year. But during the past year, intense competition has broken out among the independents, with the result that margins have narrowed dramatically. There are unlikely to be any early improvements, as Ofgas has recently lifted many of the temporary restraints it had imposed on British Gas to ensure that competition took hold. The harsh operating environment is such that most independents predict it will lead to a wave of rationalisation over the next two years. Many independents are subsidiaries of large international oil and gas companies, and thus should be able to ride out the hard times. Financially weaker companies may have to merge or seek market niches to survive. But in spite of the problems and upheavals affecting the industry, there is a growing belief that competition can be made to work if the final political go-ahead is given. Ms Spottiswoode is among the optimists. 'When we started work on this we thought there were a lot of contentious issues. But there are not really that many. The real problem is the legislative timetable.'</p>

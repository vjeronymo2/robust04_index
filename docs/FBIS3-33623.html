There are internal and external  factors that would not allow this to happen, and the Army  officers themselves are aware that this should not happen.    De Leon added that the activities in which some citizens  might have engaged near the Government House before his  announcement of the recent changes in the National Defense  General Staff are routine and Guatemalans can be certain that  there is absolute peace in this sense. Some day we will be able  to dissipate from the minds of our fellow countrymen the idea of  the traditional coup d'etat because the officers are aware of  the democratic role they must play. The commander general of  the Army has all the support of the High Command.    Referring to the three changes that have occurred in the  military leadership during his government, De Leon Carpio  explained that those are institutional and not personal  decisions of the president. De Leon Carpio added that these  changes are in line with adjustments by a government that  assumed power in a situation unprecedented in history because no  president has accepted the challenge he faced -- to become  president amid an institutional crisis, the legacy of former  President Jorge Serrano.    I accepted the command of a vessel about to sink amid  turbulence. Now, however, I am satisfied that I have guided the  vessel to more peaceful waters because I strengthened the  institutions. The political difficulty has been overcome since  the purge achieved by a referendum that made history. Entirely  secure in the institutional since, we currently have political  stability.    The first change was the removal of General Jose Domingo  Garcia Samayoa, who was the defense minister. This change had  to take place given the fact that we were trying to strengthen  the democratic system and the same chain of command that had  been in place up until 25 May could not be maintained.    The second change, which occurred 21 days later, was the  removal of General Roberto Perussina, who had replaced Garcia in  the said post. This decision was also based on the same logic.  The third and most outstanding change took place on 18 February  and involved General Jose Luis Quilo Ayuso, who was replaced in  the post of chief of the National Defense General Staff by  General Marco Antonio Gonzalez Taracena. This change confirms  the strengthening of the institutions.    De Leon explained the situation once the institutional  crisis  was solved: I can say that I have settled and not merely sat in  the presidency, and that I am willing to face the social and  economic problems. In order to solve the main problems, we will  have to implement a government agenda that considers the  investment of 28 percent of the budget to fight poverty. In  addition, we are facing a serious financial problem, and this is  why we need to obtain resources through taxes.    Regarding the current social crisis, I must clarify that  this  is a problem that I inherited, which does not mean that I will  ignore it. In the beginning I concentrated on consolidating  democracy and prepared, on a temporary basis, a 180-day program  with a few resources to tackle some social problems. Now we must  develop the government plan, which should not be subject to the  interests of any specific sector. Although our policies might  agree with the interests of some groups on certain aspects, they  are definite, and our goals regarding the exchange, credit,  labor, monetary, and other fields are clearly established. I  have not bowed to political, military, or economic interests.    In order to promote this work, I am inviting Guatemalans to  help me create a national project with the participation of all  sectors of this society.    Regarding the controversy triggered by an apparent change  in course, which came when he moved from human rights ombudsman  to his current position as president, the president affirmed  that his point of view regarding the Civilian Self-Defense  Patrols [PAC] had not changed in the least.    I have recordings in which I clearly present my position on  the PAC's. I have kept the same point of view since I wrote the  constitutional provisions on the issue as a member of the Group  of 30 at the National Constituent Assembly. I upheld my position  as human rights ombudsman and I now have the opportunity to  continue defending it as president.    My attitude remains the same. I believe the PAC's are groups  of civilians being used militarily. They are a necessary evil  because we are at war, a war whose main objective is to diminish  the insurgent movements' power.    I believe that the confusion began when a PAC member gave me  a rifle when I visited a hamlet where there were hundreds of  other patrolmen. The photograph of that instance circled the  world and was misinterpreted. They did not report what followed.  The peasant gave me the weapon and told me that it represented  the surrender of all PAC weapons to their commander in chief  once peace is signed in Guatemala.    I must clearly state that there are some PAC leaders who are  guilty of abuse. These men must be punished in accordance with  the law. The case of journalist Jorge Carpio could be an  example, if it can be proven that the attack during which three  people died was carried out by one of these groups.    The president also stated that hundreds of peasants all over  the country and particularly in the east have voluntarily left  the patrols. Many have gone on to organize peace and  development committees. I have also ordered the gradual  dissolution of the PAC's in areas where they are now unnecessary.    I continue to uphold my values and principles. I believe  there are patrol leaders who should be punished. Even so, I  maintain what I said repeatedly when I was ombudsman: These  groups must not be disbanded as long as we have an armed  conflict. Those who want them disbanded are acting on personal  interest or out of ignorance.  <H5>  A Government in Search of Peace </H5>   Almost at the close of our interview, de Leon Carpio said  that his main goal is to give his successor a nation in peace,  even though he received it in war. Although he does not believe  he can change the nation's structure, he said he wants to create  irreversible conditions that will promote such changes.    The truth of the matter is that Guatemalans are aware of the  honesty in which we are handling the matters of state. There  are no more obscure or secret transactions taking place, and,  although there is still corruption in the Executive Branch, we  are fighting to eliminate it, which in itself sets a precedent  in Latin America.    The one most important thing about my administration is that  I am going to leave the country with a taste for participation,  which is growing through honesty. I want to be remembered as  the honest president who knew how to administrate the country  properly.    De Leon Carpio also addressed the course that privatization  of state enterprises could take. On this he explained that it  has been proven that the state is an inefficient administrator.  It will be necessary to force it to compete. If our  Constitution states that there must be no monopolies, we must  find a way to eliminate them in a manner in which the end  beneficiaries are the customers who use the services. I am ready  to make whatever decisions are needed, even if that implies some  sort of political cost. I am ready to privatize as soon as the  time is right. Other presidents have been afraid to face this  problem because it will be costly at the polls later on. I have  no party. Therefore, it is easier for me to make these decisions.    The workers must leave their fears about this policy behind.  They have an example in FEGUA [Guatemalan Railroad Company].  This enterprise already went through the process. The ones who  got the most out of it were the workers. Not only do they get  their wages, but they are now working for a disciplined and  visionary corporation with highly promising plans for the future.    Privatization should not be misunderstood, because its goal  is to improve the services and goods for the customers. Through  this process, then, public schools and hospitals will be better  managed. It is the people themselves who are the best ones to  carry this out because they can organize family committees or  trusteeships to get the best results. In so doing we will be  implementing social supervision.</p>

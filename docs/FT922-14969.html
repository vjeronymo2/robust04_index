			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Japan at lowest level since December 1986 SHARE prices extended their losses on selling by arbitrageurs and institutional investors, and the Nikkei average weakened to its lowest level since December 1986, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei ended 295.76 down at 18,286.03 and has lost 7 per cent in the past three days. Index-linked buying and light bargain hunting lifted the Nikkei to the day's high of 18,804.40 in the morning. It fell to the session's low of 18,023.53 in the afternoon, dragged down by a fall in bond prices and a weaker yen. Volume expanded to 350m shares from 300m. Declines led rises by 848 to 133, with 72 issues unchanged. A total of 754 stocks hit new lows for this year. The Topix index of all first section shares shed 37.79 to 1,321.88, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 4.82 to 1,050.44. Rumours that a Middle Eastern investor had started to liquidate holdings in Japanese stocks and bonds sent jitters through the markets. Additionally, rumours that a middle-sized life assurer was in financial trouble also shook confidence. Banks, speculative stocks and high-priced small-capital issues led the market's decline. Foreigners were seen selling bank stocks because they were still regarded as expensive relative to the Nikkei average. Industrial Bank of Japan plunged Y220 to Y1,780 and Sakura Bank lost Y60 to Y950. Analysts also attributed the declines to companies selling off cross-holdings. Short-term investors, who had invested in speculative issues on margin, sold for a second day due to heavy falls in margin collateral values. Nippon Carbon dropped by its daily limit of Y100 to Y750 and Clarion, the session's most active issue, also fell the day's maximum of Y100 to Y740. But some speculative favourites regained strength on bargain hunting. Meiji Milk Products climbed Y34 to Y780 and Okamoto Industries Y45 to Y1,040. Some investors in need of cash were seen liquidating high-priced issues. Sega Enterprises fell Y300 to Y9,800 and Nintendo Y400 to Y9,000. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone lost a net Y10,000, setting a closing all-time low of Y605,000 after touching Y595,000. Buying by US pension funds lifted some international blue chips. Sony advanced Y50 to Y4,050 and Toshiba added Y15 at Y560. However, Hitachi slipped Y9 to Y761 and Matsushita Electric Industrial eased Y10 to Y1,250 on profit-taking. Traders noted buying of low-liquidity Nikkei component stocks towards the end of the session. Shimura Kako was up Y25 to Y645 and Nippon Piston Ring gained Y30 to Y552. In Osaka, the OSE average dropped 470.38 to 19,621.24 in volume of 27.1m shares. Roundup THE Pacific Basin was mixed as the fall in Tokyo continued to weigh on the region. HONG KONG rose in late trading, with strong activity in HSBC following the HKDollars 1 fall on Wednesday. It closed unchanged at HKDollars 38.75. The Hang Seng index gained 14.31 to 4,924.27 but overall turnover was sharply lower at HKDollars 1.72bn, after HKDollars 2.14bn. SEOUL closed at the year's low. The composite index lost 13.33 to 585.67 in turnover of Won462.9bn (Won329.7bn). SINGAPORE recovered a little of the ground lost on Wednesday, the Straits Times Industrial index improving 4.68 to 1,398.74 in volume of 31.4m shares, against 42.9m. KUALA LUMPUR finished on a mixed note with the composite index a marginal 0.25 off at 588.12 in volume of 33.5m shares, after 34.4m. TAIWAN reversed Wednesday's downtrend, the weighted index gaining 57.48 or 1.2 per cent to 4,733.96. Turnover fell to TDollars 15.4bn from TDollars 24.5bn. BOMBAY registered a record high, the BSE index appreciating 102.76 to 4,387.76. AUSTRALIA closed at a six-month low. The All Ordinaries index relinquished 12.8 to 1,561.2 in turnover of ADollars 278.4m.</p>

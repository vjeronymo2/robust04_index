			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Letter: Lysold is not a viable answer for Lloyd's Sir, Mr David Springbett (Letters, August 3) cannot go on getting away with his 'Improved solution for Lloyd's'. His plan is worse than naive; it is deceptively attractive to Names who have suffered enough and makes a number of unsustainable false promises. Mr Springbett's planned company, Lysold, is to take all the reserves from syndicates and from Lloyd's centrally. Out of these reserves he will produce a surplus of Pounds 1bn to capitalise Lysold and, without having to use any Funds at Lloyd's of Names for 18 months, he will pay off all litigation. He will also take over all run-off functions in Lloyd's, buy some managing and members' agencies, triple hardship terms, underwrite the estate protection plan, take over Lioncover's and Centrewrite's liabilities and more. And, finally, he will have enough left over to underwrite 25 per cent of Lloyd's capacity as a corporate Name in 1994. His suggestion that 1994 Names and subsequent Names pay a 'royalty' of between Pounds 250m and Pounds 500m a year for the next 25 years to Lysold may explain some of the magic. The only problem is that Lysold would be the only corporate Name at Lloyd's, if not the only Name. The providers of corporate capital have made it quite clear they are not prepared to pay for past losses. Lysold, if ever licensed by any authority, would be clearly unviable; 1994 syndicates would not have a penny of cash or reserves, having surrendered them all to Lysold. There would be no central fund, so I doubt that we would have many Names for 1994, or that many of our clients would value our security. The current management is striving to reform Lloyd's to take advantage of favourable market conditions. It is a great pity that we cannot all unite in that purpose. Ill-considered 'improved solutions', prepared without consultation with the management or our advisers, are an unhelpful distraction.

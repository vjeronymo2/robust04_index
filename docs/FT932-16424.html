			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Business and the Law: Pacific hot potato - Barclays' challenge to California's unitary tax system has reached the US Supreme Court The long-running legal battle over California's controversial system for taxing the operations of foreign companies has finally reached the US Supreme Court. Some time next month the justices will have to decide whether to review the nine-year-old case brought by Barclays Bank of the UK, which alleges that the state's unitary tax system is unconstitutional. The case is being followed closely by a number of foreign governments and multinationals with subsidiaries in California, and it could spark the first confrontation with President Bill Clinton over his pledge to increase the overall contribution made by foreign companies to the US fiscal pot. Under California's unitary tax system foreign-owned companies operating in the state are taxed on the percentage of their worldwide payroll, sales and property within California, rather than their locally earned income. Companies are liable to pay tax on this basis even if their California operations make no profit. At issue in the Barclays litigation is more than Dollars 500m in taxes plus interest paid by foreign multinationals into California's coffers up to 1988, when the state relaxed its unitary tax rules to allow companies to opt out of paying unitary tax in return for paying a fee. The history of the litigation is complex. In 1984 Barclays Bank, with the support of other multinational corporations and several foreign governments, filed a lawsuit alleging the California system was unconstitutional as its so-called 'worldwide combined reporting' regime interfered with the US federal government's ability to conduct foreign policy. After several battles in California's lower courts the case reached the state's appeals court in December 1990 where the judges ruled in Barclays' favour. But in May last year the California Supreme Court reversed that decision. While acknowledging that four US presidents have opposed state unitary taxes, the California Supreme Court held that Congress, which holds power over foreign commerce, has not opposed the tax. The law 'does not give executive (branch) officials carte blanche to declare state tax methods null when they irritate our trading partners,' Justice Armand Arabian said. The case has now reached the US Supreme Court along with two others which have been running in parallel - one involving Alcan Aluminum of Canada and the other Colgate-Palmolive, the US-based multinational. In February Barclays filed a petition with the US Supreme Court for certiorari (to have the California Supreme Court's decision quashed). Alcan and Colgate are expected to file similar motions shortly. The California Franchise Tax Board and others interested in filing amicus briefs, supporting either Barclays or California, have until April 24 to submit their views to the court before the justices decide on whether to review the case. The state's fear is that if it loses either the Barclays or Alcan cases, domestic multinationals will also demand the withdrawal of the unitary tax on the basis that they have the right to equal treatment. That could cost the state as much as Dollars 3.3bn in tax refunds and an estimated Dollars 110m a year in revenue. The equal treatment argument lies at the heart of the Colgate case. Colgate is attempting to overturn an earlier US Supreme Court decision on the issue in which the justices upheld the basic fairness of California's 'worldwide combined reporting' method of taxing US-based multinationals. Will the US Supreme Court agree to review the Barclays case? Most US lawyers believe that the whole issue of the taxation of US subsidiaries of foreign multinationals has become such a political hot potato since the US presidential election that the justices would find it hard not to accept the issue for review. But the bigger question is whether President Clinton will support the Californian case as he promised to do during last year's presidential election campaign. Lawyers acting for California wrote to the new administration last month reminding the president of his campaign promise that 'a Clinton administration would be pro-California in this litigation'. The state tax authorities know that unless the president specifically instructs the US solicitor general to file an amicus brief in support of the California case by the April 24 deadline the solicitor general will, as a matter of course, continue the policy of previous US administrations and file a brief in support of Barclays. If the Clinton administration does follow through on the president's campaign promise, 'it will be yet another indication of changes affecting foreign investment in the US as a result of the Clinton presidency', says Mr Charles Engros, a partner of Lord Day &amp; Lord, Barrett Smith, the US law firm. It could also produce the first confrontation between the US and foreign governments over America's tough new approach to the taxation of foreign multinationals. Senior sources in the UK Inland Revenue confirm that the British government will be filing an amicus brief with the court in favour of Barclays' position and that Britain's stance will be supported by the EC member states and other governments around the world, including Canada and Japan. Previous US administrations have always opposed unitary taxation of foreign-owned multinationals and have also been firm in their support of Barclays at each stage of the litigation, according to a Inland Revenue spokesman. The UK government has been holding 'high-level' discussions with the US administration and is confident of its continued support, he said. Earlier indications of a policy change came 'before President Clinton was aware of the full international ramifications of the issue and the reasons for previous US administrations strong support for Barclays'. One of those ramifications is the possibility of retaliatory action against US multinationals by foreign governments. The UK took powers in the 1985 Finance Act, now enshrined in section 812 of the Taxes Act, to bar tax credits to the parent companies of US groups with subsidiaries in the UK. These powers have never been used. The government has always taken the view counter-measures are a last resort, the spokesman said. But if the Barclays case fails there would be considerable parliamentary pressure to invoke the retaliatory legislation. Barclays is reluctant to talk about the litigation while the issue is so 'politically sensitive'. However, it admits that if the Supreme Court refuses to grant certiorari, or reviews the case and upholds California, it may be the end of the road so far as it is concerned. The costs of the eight-year legal battle have not been enormous compared with the Dollars 30m in taxes it hopes to recover if it wins. But the bank would be reluctant to begin all over again at state level looking for new grounds on which to challenge the unitary tax. Other multinationals might be prepared to take up the fight, but some US lawyers believe that if Barclays loses, it might be the signal for a political solution to the whole unitary tax problem. 'It is within Congress's power to pass legislation which may overturn the court's decision, if they are so inclined,' says Mr Engross. After more than a decade of wrangling many companies and governments will be hoping - one way or another - to see the back of the issue in 1993.</p>

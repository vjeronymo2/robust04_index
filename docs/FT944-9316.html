			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Arts: Harnoncourt and more - South Bank Music On Sunday at the Royal Festival Hall the Philharmonia concluded its cycle of Beethoven symphonies under Nikolaus Harnoncourt with the Ninth, prefaced by the C minor piano concerto. The soloist in the latter should have been Martha Argerich, but her place was taken by the 22-year-old Till Fellner, the Viennese winner of last year's Clara Haskil competition: tingling with musical intelligence, light-fingered and agile, but a touch self-effacing still. Brio was notably absent from Harnoncourt's opening Allegro con brio, which may have left Fellner slightly at a loss. The first orchestral statement was briskly up-tempo, but in Harnoncourt's hands the music soon became dour and square-cut: not a good springboard for the soloist. In the Largo Fellner hoped that thoughtful sincerity would do duty for full-blooded projection, but it didn't. Only in the Rondo did he and Harnoncourt find a common ground, where the young pianist could show his real promise, mettle and wit. In the 'Choral' Symphony, Harnoncourt's rigorous attention to phrasing and voicing paid off handsomely. Chiefly on the stringed instruments - I was astonished that he tolerated the horns' and timpani's smudgy dotted-triplets when he had demanded such sharp precision from his strings; yet the Scherzo was a model of urgency. The Allegro had been just as lithe, though it lacked some ballast: for Beethoven's gravity, six double-basses are simply too few in the Festival Hall. The great Adagio was all temperate, studied density, though my companion repined at Harnoncourt's turning it into 'a mere Andante'. Difficult: we know that 18th and 19th century Adagios went faster than they have done in the last 50-odd years; but how far we should adjust our sensibilities to historical rectitude is a moot point. With the sterling Philharmonia Chorus in the Finale, Hans Peter Blochwitz (a late substitute) stood out among the soloists for style and brightness, sturdily abetted by Luba Orgonasova and Ann Murray. Stephen Roberts's baritone was disappointing. Harnoncourt took the visionary passages with a kind of measured breathlessness - no mystical haze, but controlled awe; and he raced away at last to an honest, inspiriting close. As highly calculated performances go, this one was rewarding far beyond the norm. There had been a pre-concert concert at 6 o'clock, the second in the Philharmonia's 'Music of Today' series: an excellent bonus in principle, but this time a damp squib. Instead of the music originally announced, by Heine Goebells and Michael Torke, we got one piece for 14 players by James MacMillan. As the orchestra's Visiting Composer, he runs the series. The Exorcism of Rio Sumpul is a bleeding-heart response to something that happened in the Third World in 1986, in the spirit of many pieces by Nigel Osborne and MacMillan's teacher John Casken. Supposedly, helicopters of the El Salvador military came to shoot out a peasant village; miraculously nobody was killed; then the parish priest and children, and soon everyone else, took up 'a strangely comical dance' of relief and devout thanks. Not a bad scenario; but MacMillan's lengthy spoken introduction mentioned only what would anyway be obvious, the little ensemble sounded shy and wan in the big hall. The music fell of the intensity he promised. Two nights earlier, the Birmingham Contemporary Music Group, Electro-Acoustic Sound Theatre and student choirs (under Jonty Harrison) gave their all to the 1972 'Europa-version' of Stockhausen's Momente in the Queen Elizabeth Hall. It used sometimes to be taken for a momentous work, but it paled on re-acquaintance. It came from one of Stockhausen's crazier periods, when his marital life was undergoing fission. What the innumerable short-breathed 'moments' of the music could not convey - erotic rapture, mostly - is meant to be stuffed into the spoken texts and giggles. Though the dominating soprano, Angela Tunstall, was superbly equal to every demand, the score now seems a patchy thing for its length, propped up by music-theatrical whimsy. There is much better Stockhausen than this autobiographical silliness.</p>

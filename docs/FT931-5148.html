			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / German influence in Nato 'declining' GERMANY'S influence in Nato is rapidly declining, its credibility is being questioned, and it no longer deserves special treatment now that the cold war is over, General Klaus Naumann, the country's chief of staff, said yesterday, writes Judy Dempsey in Berlin. His comments follow debate among the country's political parties about how far the Bundeswehr, or armed forces, should become involved in activities outside Nato territory, as well as playing a role in UN peace-keeping and conciliation operations. They coincide with remarks by Mr Hans Dietrich Genscher, the former foreign minister, who yesterday told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper that the country's soldiers had the right to know about cuts in personnel as well as future Bundeswehr activities. Bundeswehr operations are restricted by the 1949 constitution, which limits German troops to operations on Nato territory. But Gen Naumann said it was time for the country to 'share risks'. 'You can almost see German influence in the alliance crumbling before your eyes. We Germans must realise that the basis of any alliance is the willingness to share risks. We must no longer be allowed to play a special role,' he said. This is not Gen Naumann's first public criticism of German dithering over a defence policy. In January he said Nato was disappointed with Bonn's decision not to participate in air surveillance operations if the UN imposed a no-fly zone over Bosnia-Hercegovina.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Vietnamese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Communist Party of Vietnam [CPV] Central  Committee's Ideology and Culture Department recently held a news  conference to announce the mid-term party conference.    The Seventh CPV Central Committee decided to hold the  mid-term national party conference according to Article 15 of  the party statutes. Empowered by the party Central Committee,  the Political Bureau decided that the mid-term national party  conference will open in Hanoi on 20 January 1994 and will meet  until 25 January 1994.    The mid-term national party conference will review the  implementation of the Seventh Party Congress resolution, sum up  the actual results of the renovation process obtained since the  Sixth Party Congress, and define major policies and measures  aimed at successfully implementing the Seventh Party Congress  resolution.    The conference will hold a by-election to chose a number of  members for the party Central Committee as stipulated in Article  13 of the party statutes.    The mid-term national party conference will be attended by  649 delegates, three advisers to the CPV Central Committee, and  10 former Political Bureau members.    The Political Bureau affirms that the mid-term national  party  conference will be a major party conference and an important  event in the political life of our party and people and that it,  however, is not a party congress. The conference will be  organized in a solemn fashion, but it should bear the character  of an internal meeting. Its activities should be carried out in  a practical, effective, and thrifty manner without any showy  displays and ceremonies.</p>

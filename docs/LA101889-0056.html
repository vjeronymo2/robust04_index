			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT DIPS 0.1%, THE FIRST DECLINE IN 6 MONTHS  </P> <P> Industrial production dipped 0.1% in September, the first drop in six months,  the Federal Reserve said Tuesday in a report that reflected continued weakness  in the manufacturing sector of the economy.  </P> <P> But Michael Evans of Evans Economics Inc., a Washington forecasting firm, said  that "while the economy is not strong, there's no sign of a downturn."  </P> <P> The Fed said last month's decline in output was the first since a 0.2% drop  last February. It followed a revised gain of 0.3% in August and an unchanged  rate in July.  </P> <P> Cynthia Latta, an economist at the DRI/McGraw-Hill forecasting firm in  Lexington, Mass., said industrial production has been cut in half this year,  compared to 1988.  </P> <P> "This confirms that demand is slowing," she said. "When you get a slowdown in  the economy, it tends to show up first in the goods sector."  </P> <P> In another report, the Fed said the operating rate of the nation's factories,  mines and utilities also fell in September, by 0.2 percentage point to 83.6%.  This also reflected the decline in the production rate.  </P></p>

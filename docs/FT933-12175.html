			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Survey of Cardiff Bay and the Barrage (8): Early lettings welcomed - Property: A difficult scene THE LARGEST pre-let contracts in the UK, in both 1991 and 1992, were negotiated on 170 acres of land owned by Grosvenor Waterside, the property development arm of Associated British Ports, in one segment of Cardiff Bay. The brick-built, flat-roofed, Welsh Health Common Services Authority building, covering 150,000 sq ft, and costing Pounds 15m, is now approaching completion and will be ready for occupation from September. Work is about to start on a Pounds 16m building for NCM Credit Insurance, which will result in the creation of a flagship 119,000 sq ft office development built to a very high specificiation in pink granite, with an atrium, facing the inner harbour. Also planned for Capital Waterside, which adjoins the historic Pier Head building, once the headquarters for all the Great Western Railway's dock operations, are a new Welsh national opera house, which will be the subject of an international design competition, a high quality 200-250 bed hotel, 25,000 sq ft of shops and 200 houses. 'These lettings represent a significant commitment to the bay,' according to Mike Rees, director-in-charge of the Cardiff office of Chesterton. And Rhys James, partner with DTZ Debenham Thorpe, adds: 'In the present climate these deals represent real success. Now what Grosvenor Waterside has to do is to create a better mix on the site. The group needs to find clients who will take around 10,000 sq ft of space, so that one or two very large buildings do not dominate. Grosvenor has planning permission for 800,000 sq ft on the site, which is plenty of capacity for such a mix.' Despite these two big successes, the general property scene in Cardiff has not been any easier than elsewhere in Britain as the recession bites. 'There are clients looking around but they cannot get rid of their present leases, especially those wanting to move out of the south east of England,' Mr James says. Among those looking, according to Mike Hall, of Cooke and Arkwright, are the Property Services Agency, on behalf of the Lord Chancellor's department, which is seeking 45,000 sq ft for a relocation from London; the insurance group Axa, which wants about the same space; the Department of Health and Social Services; and Maryland Bank, an American finance house which is understood to have Cardiff as one of three potential centres for a European operation. Any one of these would continue the office-market momentum developed by the health authority and NCM. The bay itself, a relatively small part of the Welsh capital, has been successful in the past two years with a number of high-profile names arriving, among them the Prudential which took 22,000 sq ft a year ago at Atlantic House for a regional headquarters for 150 staff. The bay has been given a further boost with the rescue of Alexandra Gate, a development on the eastern edge of the bay area, the developer of which was a local firm which subsequently went into receivership. Welsh Water is to move its corporate headquarters from another building in the city to Alexandra Gate, a campus-type development, with the private mining group, Ryan, and Wales and the West Housing Association taking the other two blocks. These moves have met some criticism, however. Chesterton's Mr Hall argues that the incentive packages offered through public and quasi-public sources have made comparable city centre schemes uncompetitive. There are about 200,000 sq ft - 18 months supply - of good-quality accommodation available in the centre of Cardiff. The largest of these is Principality Building Society's own development in Queen Street, the city's main shopping street, where about 55,000 sq ft out of the 65,000 sq ft built is still available. Mr Hall also says that potential entrants to the bay, such as Legal and General, and Canada Life Assurance, have been been frightened off by the lack of speculative developments, poor access and difficult parking. 'About 100,000 sq ft of offices, both refurbished and second-hand, remain vacant at the commercial heart of the bay at Mount Stuart Square, but poor accessibility, specification and parking are likely to result in these remaining vacant in the short- to medium-term.' Cardiff rents remain, generally, below those asked in Bristol and further east along the M4 motorway corridor. DTZ Debenham Thorpe's Mr James believes around Pounds 16 a sq ft is as much as could be obtained. 'Two years ago we were hoping to reach the Pounds 20 level'. The Welsh Health Services building has been let on a 25-year full repair and insurance lease, at an average rent for the first five years of Pounds 14.50 per sq ft with five year reviews. NCM has negotiated a 15-year lease at a rate in excess of Pounds 15. The shorter-than-normal term represents a compromise agreed with Grosvenor Waterside between normal UK practice and 10-year deals, common in the Netherlands where NCM is based. Cooke and Arkwright's Mike Hall agrees that 'between Pounds 14 and Pounds 16 is about the top of the market at the moment, especially in the bay'. These rates, however, take no account of hidden incentives, which neither developer nor client is willing to discuss. Mr Rees believes a client such as the Prudential may have extracted a rent-free period equal to 12-18 months rent. The dice are, naturally, very much loaded in the tenants' favour in the present economic climate. 'Of all the deals done in Cardiff in the last year,' says Mr James, 'just over 90 per cent were leasehold. That is, they were in the tenant's favour, with attractive break clauses and rent-free periods. The developer is now almost looking to the first rent review to recover.' According to Jim Fitzsimmons, the property development manager for Cardiff Bay, the main developments will come on stream at the right time when the economy generally is emerging from recession. A key area is known as the Bridge, located between the city centre and the bay. Here around 1m sq ft of office development is planned around a new city square at the top of the main highway out of the bay. 'Once the barrage is completed we expect a strong level of interest. We will have large amounts of land available, too, at this time,' Fitzsimmons argues. Elsewhere there is strong activity at the moment in the retail sector, with Comet, MFI and McDonalds going to an out-of-town location developed by television contractor HTV, near a recently opened site on which both Tesco and Marks and Spencer have stores. In the city centre, too, there is interest in a development being undertaken on the site of a former Allders store in the main Queen Street shopping thoroughfare by a London and Edinburgh Trust (LET) and BICC joint venture. Known as Queen's Arcade, it is planned to open at Easter 1994, with the largest units totallling around 25,000 sq ft. Pre-lets have been arranged with Dolcis, Argos and Leeds Permanent building society, and others are expected in the next few weeks. Tesco is also taking a prestige site for a superstore on the western side of the barrage in Penarth Haven, where a successful marina and housing development has already taken place. On the industrial side, the Bay has three fully-serviced sites at Ocean Park, Pengam and Tremorfa. Sites at the 100-acre Ocean Park, which has been zoned for B1/B2 development, are being offered at Pounds 150,000 per acre on a 999-year lease with an option to convert to full freehold for a peppercorn sum. The development is expected eventually to provide 1.2m sq ft of factory floor space, 150.000 sq ft of offices, 300 homes and 30,000 sq ft of leisure facilities. According to the CBDC, there are signs of renewed interest among developers, with a number of interested parties talking about schemes in the region of 140,000sq ft to 180,000 sq ft.  -------------------------------------------------------- CARDIFF BAY OFFICE LOCATION PROPOSALS  -------------------------------------------------------- THE BRIDGE  -------------------------------------------------------- City centre location 850,000 sq ft offices Car parking Hotel Small retail element Car parking  -------------------------------------------------------- CAPITAL WATERSIDE  -------------------------------------------------------- Waterfront location Consent for 1m sq ft offices First class hotel Site for opera house Retail/leisure  -------------------------------------------------------- MOUNT STUART SQUARE  -------------------------------------------------------- Professional environment 250,000 sq ft offices 100,000 sq ft historic building refurbishment Car parking  -------------------------------------------------------- ATLANTIC WHARF  -------------------------------------------------------- Campus site 350,000 sq ft B1 offices  -------------------------------------------------------- OCEAN PARK  -------------------------------------------------------- Campus site 150,000 sq ft B1 offices  -------------------------------------------------------- FERRY ROAD  -------------------------------------------------------- Campus site 1m sq ft B1 offices  -------------------------------------------------------- PENARTH HAVEN  -------------------------------------------------------- Campus site 30,000 sq ft B1 offices  --------------------------------------------------------</p>

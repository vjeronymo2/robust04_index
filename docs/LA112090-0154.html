			<p><P> November 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIET EMIGRES MAKING OWN NEWS  </P> <P> Soviet emigres came out in force Sunday night to celebrate the 10th anniversary  and 500th issue of Panorama, a Los Angeles-based, Russian-language weekly. More  than honoring a newspaper, however, the ebullient crowd of 1,100 who packed  Temple Beth El in West Hollywood seemed to be celebrating their own coming of  age in America.  </P> <P> It was a moment between the old and new countries and cultures. The buffet  tables were so numerous and groaned with such an abundance of Russian salads  and snacks that, in spite of the crowd, there was nothing remotely resembling a  Soviet queue.  </P> <P> The women wore everything from gold lame to casual pants and tops; the men  ranged from tuxes or double breasted suits to unmatched jackets and trousers.  </P> <P> Virtually everyone spoke Russian as they stood under clusters of colorful  balloons and accepted sweet wine or Champagne from bartenders wearing berets,  scarves, and T-shirts bearing the Panorama logo printed in Russian.  </P> <P> Editor and publisher Alexander Polovets took to the stage with some of the  paper's contributors and supporters, such as actor Ilya Baskin, columnist Si  Frumkin and lawyer Boris Gorbis, to read greetings from President Bush, Vice  President Quayle, Mayor Bradley, Governor-elect Pete Wilson and Gov.  Deukmejian.  </P> <P> Testimonials and plaques were read and presented from the county, the city and  the Jewish Federation Council of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> And then, on to a Russian language multimedia performance, most of it comedy or  satire, relying heavily on reminders of the hardships of life in the old  country.  </P> <P> "Panorama is the one thing we can all be proud of," Gorbis said.  </P> <P> Describing himself as Panorama's "first paid subscriber," Gorbis, who  immigrated here in 1975, said: "There are things in the community that divide  us. These are people who never wanted to be a community. They were suspicious  of community. It meant connection to the authorities.  </P> <P> "That Panorama has become such a unifying force and voice in the Russian  community is an incredible feat."  </P></p>

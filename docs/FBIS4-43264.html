			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Helena Sjogren report: "Bildt Pleased With Yes Victory"] </F>   [Text] "An important signal to Sweden in the run-up to our  forthcoming referendum" -- this was [Prime Minister] Carl  Bildt's comment on Austria's emphatic yes to the European Union  [EU].    European cooperation that country after country wants to  join  is cooperation that Sweden cannot remain outside, Bildt writes  in a press statement.    Bildt interprets the Austrians' massive yes to membership in  the Union as a wish for influence. Austria does not want to  stand outside the peace and security order that is now emerging.    Opposition leader Ingvar Carlsson also expressed happiness  with the result of the referendum yesterday:    "It is enormously positive bearing in mind that Austria like  Sweden is a neutral country."    According to the opinion polls, there were many people who  did not make up their minds until the last minute.    "This indicates that it is very difficult to measure  election  results using opinion polls. In the past I have said that I do  not believe that we in Sweden can predict election results using  opinion polls. I am even more convinced now," Ingvar Carlsson  told TIDNINGARNAS TELEGRAMBYRA.    Odd Engstrom (Social Democratic Party), the spokesman for  the  Yes to Europe organization, said that Austria's referendum  result will be an example for Sweden.    Eva-Britt Svensson (Social Democratic Party), one of the two  chairmen of the No to the EU organization, believes that an  important reason for the Austrian result is the fact that the no  side in Austria did not have any similar organization.    "There has been no organization that the broad opposition to  the EU in Austria has been able to identify with," she said.  ``That is why this broad opposition has not shown itself in the  result.    ``Instead that right-wing populist, Haider, has frightened  people off.    ``Here in Sweden we conduct the debate differently, using  objective arguments.''    Svensson does not believe that the Austrian result will  influence public opinion in Sweden.    Marianne Samuelsson, spokesman for the Green Ecology Party,  which is campaigning against EU membership, was not particularly  surprised by the yes victory:    "It is true that it is probably a bigger majority than we  were expecting," she told DAGENS NYHETER. "And this will of  course have an influence on the Swedish people."</p>

			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Observer: The siren calls of Paris Does the British government ever talk to itself? Lord Lawson, bidding to be next boss of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, is not the only Brit seeking a cushy job in Paris. Robert Priddle, a deputy secretary at the DTI, is also being pushed to be executive director of the International Energy Agency. It's all rather odd. The IEA is an OECD affiliate - they share the same headquarters in Paris's fashionable 16th arrondissement - and it's unusual for a government to chase the two top jobs in allied institutions, especially when both are hotly contested. Number 10 and the Treasury have thrown their collective weight behind Lawson's candidacy for the OECD. However, the DTI has been backing Priddle, 55, for the IEA post - against candidates from Belgium, Norway and Italy - since the middle of last year. Although there is no vacancy yet, the present incumbent, Helga Steeg, 66, is expected to retire later this year, after 10 years in the post. Priddle is better qualified than his present post - head of the DTI's corporate and consumer affairs division - might suggest. An energy expert, he chaired the IEA governing board between October 1991 and September 1992. He was also in charge of the UK government's energy policy until late October 1992, when he was transferred to his present post one week after the crisis over coal pit closures. Qualified he may be; but with a government apparently unable to get its internal communications straight, he may still have problems getting that message through.</p>

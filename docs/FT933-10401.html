			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / UK Company News: CE Heath raises Pounds 21m in share sale CE HEATH and CE Heath International Holdings yesterday announced the successful completion of the placing of 32.4m HIH shares held by Risk Management Holdings, a wholly owned subsidiary of Heath. HIH is the Australian holding company which owns Heath's underwriting operations in Australasia and the Pacific Basin and was, until its flotation on the Australian stock exchange in June 1992, a subsidiary of Heath. Following its listing Heath's interest was reduced to below 50 per cent. Yesterday's placing left the insurance broking group with just 25 per cent of the company. The shares have been placed by MacQuarie Equities with a number of institutional investors worldwide at ADollars 1.40 apiece, against their last traded price of ADollars 1.42. The placing will raise some Pounds 21m before tax, against a book value at March 31 of about Pounds 14.3m. Of the net proceeds, Pounds 11m will be used to reduce bank borrowings. The balance will be used to fund expansion.</p>

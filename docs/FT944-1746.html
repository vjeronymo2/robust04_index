			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Management: What's the score on choice? Selecting a test involves more than flipping through a few catalogues and picking one that sounds good. Conscientious employers should consider a number of factors before choosing a test. David Bartram of Hull University, and a member of the British Psychological Society's test standards committee, encourages employers to examine any potential test for: Scope - what areas of ability or personality are you trying to cover? Accuracy or reliability - will the same test yield similar results if the same individual sits in two weeks' time? Validity - does the test measure what it says it does? For example, if a test yields a score on a person's persuasiveness, will the person who scores high on that scale actually be more persuasive than others who score low on the scale? A good test should always include statistical data to back up its claims of validity, and the BPS competency courses should train users to be able to read these statistics. Fairness - is there any evidence to show that the test is unfairly biased against certain groups, such as women or ethnic minorities? Acceptability - how well will the test you are planning to use fit into the organisation and its image? Practicality - assess the time, resources and cost factors involved with the test.</p>

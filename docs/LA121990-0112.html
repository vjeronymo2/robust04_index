			<p><P> December 19, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GETTY BECOMES A REFUGE FOR VICTIMS OF WAR;  </P> <P> ART: CONSERVATORS SAVE DAMAGED ROMANIAN TREASURES.  </P> <P> The J. Paul Getty Trust may be known as an ivory tower, but it is developing a  new image as an enlightened good neighbor. The Getty can't care for the entire  globe's cultural heritage any more than it can buy all the treasures offered  for sale, but it can become a catalyst for international cooperation as it  adopts a world view of where its money should go, trust officials say.  </P> <P> "We can't do it all, but we are constantly looking for ways that we can make a  significant difference, and to get the most bang for the buck," said Harold  Williams, director of the trust. Going it alone is not necessarily the best  answer, according to Williams, who speaks of "leveraging" resources and  "collaborating" with other institutions as the Getty creates a distinctive  place for itself in the international art community.  </P> <P> The latest example of this expansive point of view could hardly be more  dramatic. Four Italian paintings from the National Art Museum of Romania in  Bucharest that sustained drastic damage during the Romanian revolution last  December are undergoing treatment in J. Paul Getty Museum's conservation  laboratory. Romanian conservator Simona Predescu, who has come to Malibu for  six months, is working with Getty staff to restore these survivors of war.  </P> <P> The most highly revered -- and the most severely damaged -- is "Young Mother,"  a luminous painting of a woman nursing a baby by Orazio Lomi Gentileschi. A  strip of canvas about 3 or 4 inches wide was ripped out of the lower  mid-section of the painting by a bullet that penetrated a wall of the museum.  One section of the severed strip fell to the floor and was saved, but another  portion burned up and must be re-created, Predescu explained. She will work  with Getty associate conservator Elizabeth Mention to rejoin the salvaged piece  and to make a replacement for the missing part.  </P> <P> The conservators must fashion a patch of canvas that matches the texture and  weight of fabric used for the original painting, then join the patch and the  salvaged piece by attaching threads around the edges with a synthetic resin.  After building up a gesso background on exposed canvas areas, Mention will  paint in the blank spots with the help of photographs. The treatment will also  include a thorough cleaning, removing a border that was added to enlarge the  painting and replacing a late 19th-Century canvas lining.  </P> <P> Daunting as the task appears to be, the situation could have been much worse,  Mention said. If the mother's and baby's faces had been lost, the painting  probably could not have been saved.  </P> <P> Another victim of the Romanian revolution, a Bolognese School "Allegoric Scene"  attributed to Carlo Nuvolone, was torn by gunfire on its lower right corner.  Genovese painter Luigi Miradori's "The Guarding Angel," in which an angel shows  a kneeling man the differences between heaven and hell, was riddled by flying  debris. Its entire surface was roughed up and dozens of holes appeared where  paint got so hot that it blistered and dropped off. The fourth Romanian-owned  painting at the Getty is Pietro da Cortona's "Virgin With Child," which was  bombarded by particles of broken plaster and other materials when a shell  exploded inside the museum.  </P> <P> The bullets that flew through Bucharest last December were aimed at human  targets and many of them hit their marks. After a week of bloodletting that  started in the western town of Timisoara and wound up in the capital city,  thousands of Romanians had been felled and dictator Nicolae Ceausescu was  destined to join the dead. But the uprising also wreaked havoc on cultural  treasures, Predescu said. The country's most valuable cache of art was in the  National Art Museum of Romania, unfortunately located next to a prime target:  the presidential palace in the heart of Bucharest.  </P> <P> This complex of government buildings was the site of intense combat. Machine  guns battered the museum from the outside, ripping through paintings as they  penetrated thick walls. Combatants who hid inside the museum were snuffed out  with more firepower, which filled the galleries with shrapnel, smoke and flying  debris.  </P> <P> When the fighting finally ceased, the museum's four conservators were faced  with the devastating sight of fried, pock-marked, shredded artworks. Hundreds  of pieces were damaged -- some beyond repair, others only in need of cleaning,  Predescu said.  </P> <P> A delegation of Romanian cultural leaders subsequently came to the United  States, seeking aid but also establishing contacts with American colleagues.  Several Getty administrators and staff members have visited Central and Eastern  Europe during the past year as well, to determine what help is needed. As a  result of these exchanges, four paintings were selected for treatment at the  Getty. Several Dutch paintings are undergoing conservation at the Rijksmuseum  in Amsterdam and some Italian works are expected to be treated in Italy.  </P> <P> Instead of mounting an independent salvage operation, the Getty invited a  Romanian conservator to visit the laboratory and join in the work. Predescu  prevailed over a senior colleague because she could speak English and drive a  car -- two important survival skills in Southern California.  </P> <P> "As important as these paintings are, it's more important that the conservator  has come here," Williams said. Giving Predescu access to the latest in American  conservation techniques and technology, an experience that she will take home  to Bucharest and share with her colleagues, is a way of leveraging the Getty's  support, he said.  </P> <P> Predescu noted that her studio in Bucharest is too small to accommodate large  artworks and that the museum's equipment is relatively primitive. There are no  X-ray facilities like the Getty's which examined the damaged paintings. Instead  of relining paintings with heat-activated adhesives on a modern vacuum table,  as Getty conservators do, Predescu said she uses an iron and natural glue.  </P> <P> Predescu is highly skilled, however, and Getty conservators say they are  benefiting from the exchange as well. "We don't see damage like this. It's a  great experience for all of us," said conservator Mark Leonard.  </P> <P> In an effort to learn all they can about the visiting paintings, Getty  scientists will analyze microscopic samples of paint chips to determine the  kinds of ground coats and pigments used, the structure of layers and disclose  other information that may prove useful in the future.  </P> <P> "Our collection is quite well cared for, so we hope to do more of this,"  Leonard said, pointing out two other painting conservation projects that have  been accepted in exchange for showing the works at the J. Paul Getty Museum.  </P> <P> One, Agnolo Bronzino's Mannerist "Portrait of a Young Man," is already cleaned  and on view at the museum. The painting, which belongs to the Nelson-Atkins  Museum of Art in Kansas City, Mo., was recently treated in the Getty lab by  Nelson-Atkins conservator Scott Heffley. The other project concerns "Mars and  Venus Surprised by Vulcan" by Paris Bordone, a large painting from the  Staatliche Museen in West Berlin, which is awaiting treatment by Getty  conservators.  </P> <P> These collaborations are typical of a trust-wide effort to find appropriate  ways to be of service and advance scholarship, said Deborah Gribbon, associate  director for curatorial affairs at the Getty. "It's important to emphasize that  we are not aiding the needy. These are genuine colleagues with whom we have  been out of touch. We want to find out what help they think they need," she  said.  </P> <P> Determining what help is needed and establishing priorities can be difficult,  however. Deborah Marrow, director of the Getty's grant program, said that  grants to Central European scholars are under consideration and noted that her  program is being scrutinized to see if it suits the needs of such applicants.  </P> <P> "We are still sorting out the situation," said Williams, who has visited  Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia. "It is traumatic to move into a free market  because of inflation, problems with fuel oil and the specter of unemployment. A  lot of institutions are over-staffed . . . and many are looking at a 20% cut  (in spending power)," he said.  </P> <P> The severity of the problem was sharply illustrated by a visit to a university  in Krakow, Williams recalled. "I asked if they would like significant support  for the university library, and I was told, 'Of course, but we have 750 art  history students and we don't even have a slide projector to show them  artworks.' "  </P> <P> The Getty will probably provide the slide projector, but "there are no quick  fixes," Williams said. Still, "it's clear that even a small amount of aid has a  big impact in terms of morale," he said.  </P> <P> One thing the trust plans to do is to co-host (with the Mellon Foundation in  New York) a meeting of foundations that want to help Central Europe. "These are  people who don't talk to each other," Williams said, expressing the hope that  bringing them together "to exchange views might avoid duplication and make them  more effective."  </P></p>

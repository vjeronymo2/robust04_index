			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / City regulators angry over Taurus decision THE government's decision to hand regulatory responsibility for Taurus, the stock market's planned settlement system, to the stock exchange was greeted with barely concealed anger in some City regulatory circles yesterday. Mr John Redwood, corporate affairs minister, has decided not to give the task to the existing investment watchdogs for fear of adding to the bureaucracy created by the Financial Services Act. Yet some investment regulators argue that giving the job to the exchange, with the Department of Trade and Industry retaining overall responsibility, will lead to conflicts between regulatory agencies, and will expose 'horrendous' conflicts of interest within the exchange. It will mean that both the exchange and the existing self-regulating organisations will be responsible for assessing whether an investment firm is 'fit and proper' to operate. Differences of opinion could cause problems, one senior regulator said privately yesterday. 'We all feel it won't work. It will fall down where there is a difference of opinion,' he said. A further difficulty, he said, was that the exchange would act as regulator and commercial operator of Taurus. This would create conflicts of interest, as it would be forced at times to discipline investment firms that were in fact among its biggest customers. Mr Redwood's decision, conveyed to regulators last Friday, is due to be announced formally on Thursday when the DTI publishes its long-awaited legal regulations paving the way for Taurus. At the same time, he will announce an annual ceiling for the Taurus compensation scheme of Pounds 100m - far less than the Pounds 1bn he had urged earlier, but more than the Pounds 50m originally proposed by the exchange. The launch of Taurus - probably in about a year - will create an important regulatory task. The many brokers, custodians, registrars and others linked electronically to the system will need to be assessed on their technical expertise and their fitness and properness, as well as their capital adequacy. Giving this job to the existing investment regulators would have brought registrars, custodians and nominees within the scope of the FSA - something that the DTI, already recoiling from the over-complexity of the existing regulatory structure, was not willing to do.</p>

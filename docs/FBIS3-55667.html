			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Jan 10, BNS -- Estonian President Lennart  Meri in a statement, addressed to the public on Sunday [9  January], explained the reasons behind holding back his  approval to new ministerial nominations.    Meri, denying allegations by some leading politicians, said  there was no constitutional crisis in Estonia. Meri said he as  the country's president had based his actions on the president's  rights and responsibilities, as stipulated by the Constitution.    He quoted the Constitution's Article 90, which says that no  minister can be relieved of duties or appointed to office  without a presidential ruling, which in turn has to be preceded  by a formal proposal by the prime minister. The choice between  approval or non- approval of the candidate is left with the  president, Meri says in the statement.    "The proposal concerning changes in the Cabinet, submitted  by the prime minister on Jan. 6, was a rather large-scale one:  the proposal suggested the replacement of the foreign minister,  the economics, the finance minister and the defense minister;  the defense minister was to replace the foreign minister, the  rest of the vacant ministerial positions were to be given to  three members of the parliament. The President of the Republic,  taking as basis the prime minister's proposal, made a decision  in a smaller scale than what was suggested. With this ruling  from Jan. 7, 1994, the president didn't create a constitutional  crisis. On the contrary, while making my decision I proceeded  from the presidential oath: to faithfully fulfil my duties with  all my abilities and to the best of my judgement for the good  of the Estonian people and the Republic," the president said.    Meri said he had talked with Prime Minister Mart Laar about  the possibilities to more effectively organize the state  leadership work already in September. The prime minister then  had considered it unnecessary to make changes in the Cabinet.    "The outcome of the local elections, which were held after  that, showed that power relations between the political forces  in Estonia had changed during the year. The prime minister made  his conclusions and decided on Cabinet changes, for which  purpose he started to resolve the crisis emerged in the Pro  Patria (party). International developments went their own way,  which was not quite favorable for Estonia. Therefore I suggested  to the prime minister and the foreign minister on Dec. 22 to  postpone making changes in the Cabinet until late February, so  that we could realistically take into account the new power  relations in Europe. /--/ These arguments, which directly  concern Estonia's security policy, were not taken into account  and the proposed Cabinet changes regrettably have coincided with  crucial foreign political events," the president's statement  reads.    Meri says no concrete shortcomings were pointed at in the  work of Economics Minister Toomas Sildmae. He says Sildmae also  enjoys the trust of many Cabinet members. The president says he  has met Heiki Kranich, candidate for the post of the finance  minister, only twice so far, and economics minister nominee  Toivo Jurgenson, only once.    "Under such circumstances it would have been irresponsible  of  me to approve the candidates. I once more say: I have sworn to  the State Assembly and to the people to fulfil my duties to the  best of my judgement. Therefore please allow me to once again  emphasize that in a democratic practice of state leadership the  advisability of decisions by the head of the government has to  be clear to the Estonian citizens, the State Assembly and the  president," Meri says.    The president said he had made a decision to some extent  different from what had been suggested, thus giving the prime  minister the opportunity to once again and with full seriousness  wage giving or not giving the control levers of the country's  economy into the hands of the best experts.    "I regret that the government has interpreted my position  from a one-sided point of view and presented the problem in a  different light, in order to exert pressure on me by referring  to a constitutional crisis. I am particularly worried by the  time-point. At present we should concentrate our forces on the  most critical section of the front -- on the foreign policy, on  ensuring Estonia's security. The head of the government has  chosen the wrong time and the wrong way," the president says.</p>

The condition of the wounded man, a new immigrant from  Russia, is not grave. He was transferred to Kaplan Hospital.  Our correspondents Yehudit Yehezqeli and Nisim Qeynan report  that the assailant escaped on foot.    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0505 GMT on 15 February  carries an interview with a police officer who says the police  have captured an "18-year-old Arab suspect from Gaza, who led  police to where he threw the ax he used in the attack."]    A Border Police force captured two members of an Islamic  Jihad band in Gaza. Two Uzi submachine guns, which were stolen  with eight other submachine guns from Moshav Hodiyya in the  south about 10 days ago, were found in their possession.    Faris Abu-Zakar, a member of the Popular Front for the  Liberation of Palestine's Red Eagles in Rafah, wounded Friday in  a clash with soldiers, has died of his wounds.</p>

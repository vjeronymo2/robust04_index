			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Great expectations and low profits for agencies If advertising agencies were not already suffused with gloom, the latest annual profitability survey* by Touche Ross will dispel any doubts that they are facing a structural crisis every bit as profound as that being experienced by other once-powerful UK industries. The Touche Ross survey, published tomorrow shows that average profit margins  -operating profit as a percentage of turnover - have fallen for the third year (from 1.9 per cent to 1.8 per cent), the lowest for seven years. At the same time average staff costs per head increased by 6.6 per cent, while average gross income per head grew by only 2.9 per cent. As agencies have become less profitable, they have also become more indebted; long term debt increased by 15 per cent to Pounds 1.33bn. Interest costs now account for 36 per cent of the potential pre-tax profits of the agencies, compared with 26 per cent in the previous year's survey. Pre-tax profits fell for all of the 13 publicly-quoted agencies, except the media-buying CIA group; nine of those surveyed saw pre-tax profits fall by 35 per cent or more. The survey compares the financial performances of 50 agency groups - public and private, UK and foreign - covering December 1990 to November 1991. Average pre-tax profits of the 50 agency groups surveyed remained unchanged, at Pounds 3.2m; but excluding WPP - which accounted for 56 per cent of the total pre-tax profits of all agencies in the survey - the remaining agencies reported a fall in average pre-tax profits of 16 per cent. The survey suggests that the larger fish - WPP, Saatchi and Saatchi, and the Lowe Group - have increased in strength relative to some of the minnows. Those three agencies accounted for 89 per cent of the total pre-tax profits of the surveyed companies against 75 per cent previously. One aspect which is bound to be closely studied is the section dealing with aggregate operating profit per employee, down by 1 per cent to Pounds 4,882, against an 11.5 per cent increase in 1991's survey; in 1988 the figure was Pounds 6,029. Heading the table of gross income per employee - a key indicator of agency strength - is Butterfield Day Devito Hockney, followed by Geers Gross (since acquired by Publicis) and Edwards Martin Thornton. David Miles of Touche Ross says 'a typical response among agencies (to their financial problems) has been to reduce staff numbers but not overall levels of reward. Expectations remain high in a sector where 'tightening one's belt' still means something the mechanic does to the GTi convertible.' Admittedly the survey is retrospective, but according to research** published next week by Zenith Media, part of Saatchi and Saatchi, there is nothing to comfort anxious agency heads in the run-up to Christmas. Instead of the traditional rise in advertising expenditure in the final quarter, Zenith forecasts a fall of 7 per cent in television advertising revenue. What Zenith's forecasts appear to confirm is a double-dip in television advertising revenues; the last quarter of 1990 registered a real decline of 10 per cent. Such advertising revenue collapses, precisely in the period when companies normally spend the bulk of their advertising budgets, have not been seen since 1974 (a last quarter real decline of 18 per cent) and 1969 (decline of 11 per cent). Frank Harrison, who has carried out the research for Zenith, believes there are two reasons for the collapse. 'Companies with foreign parents, reporting profits in non-UK currencies, have seen their UK contribution significantly reduced following the unforeseen withdrawal of the pound from the ERM and its subsequent devaluation. And with the economic recession deeper and more protracted than expected, many companies are finding it difficult to meet profit targets for 1992 and have consequently cut back on advertising in quarter four.' Nor are agencies alone in their fear that the recession may now actually be turning into slump. From January 1 1993, Channel 4 will be responsible for selling its own air-time to advertisers; further down the road is the projected Channel 5. Channel 4 is safeguarded to some extent: if advertising revenues fall below 14 per cent of terrestrial net advertising revenue (TNAR), then ITV must top up revenue to a maximum of 2 per cent of TNAR. But without some return of consumer confidence - and willingness to spend - advertisers will show little inclination to restore slashed marketing budgets. The end result could be an even tighter squeeze, not just on advertising agencies but on also some successful bidders in the ITV network, who made their bids on very different anticipated advertising revenue forecasts. *How Advertising Agencies Made Their Profits In 1991; available from Nicola Toosey, Touche Ross, Hill House, 1 Little New Street, London EC4A 3TR; 071 936 3000.

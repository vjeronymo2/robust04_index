			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Fresh bids invited for city's bus companies The Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Authority announced yesterday that it was ready to consider revised bids for both of its bus companies, Charles Batchelor writes. The authority is to consider a revised bid, thought to be worth nearly Pounds 25m, for Greater Manchester Buses North from an employee buy-out team. It has also invited British Bus, a private company that was initially the preferred bidder, to resubmit its bid. The authority has also given the employee buy-out team which has bid for Greater Manchester Buses South until Tuesday to confirm they are able to continue with their bid, thought to be worth about Pounds 15m. Stagecoach Holdings, a Perth-based bus company, has made a bid believed to be worth about Pounds 20m.</p>

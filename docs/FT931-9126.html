			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / The law is an asset If he is not careful, Mr Douglas Hurd will be subjected to Lord Salisbury's verdict on the late Mr Iain Macleod - that he is 'too clever by half'. Or, as old-fashioned British nannies warned their charges: 'You are so sharp you might cut yourself.' The foreign secretary must have known that this might be the response to yesterday's statement on the bill to ratify the Maastricht treaty. He was at his most persuasive, his dulcet tones confirming that here was a delicate one. His argument does take some swallowing. On January 20 Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, the foreign office minister responsible for seeing the bill through, said that if a certain Labour amendment - number 27 on the list - was carried, 'United Kingdom law would not conform to the provisions of the treaty, so we could not ratify it'. Yesterday his boss, Mr Hurd, said that 'amendment number 27 would . . . not have any effect on the treaty itself . . .' What has happened in the intervening weeks is that the government nearly fell off its perch. Conservative opponents thought that by supporting the amendment they could sink the treaty; Labour enthusiasts for the EC's social programme thought that the amendment would oblige the government to renegotiate the whole deal, and sign up to their beloved 'social chapter'. The government's lawyers have now come to the rescue. They have done what the best mouthpieces always do in such circumstances. They have thought again. This is hardly surprising: they have a powerful client. They were wrong on January 20, and right yesterday. For the celebrated amendment simply excludes the protocol on social policy from the bill. That protocol itself excuses Britain from participation in the social chapter, which the other 11 members of the EC have agreed to implement. Either way, there are no legally-binding rights or obligations that affect Britain, so there need be no legislation on this point. Deleting the protocol would not bring the social chapter into effect in Britain. I cannot understand why the Labour party ever thought it would. It might have wrecked the treaty. The Tory Eurosceptics cannot be blamed for thinking that it could, since in earlier efforts to frighten pro-European Labour MPs off their party's amendment both Mr Hurd and Mr Garel-Jones rammed home that very argument. No longer. 'In summary,' said Mr Hurd yesterday, 'the law officers consider that, while incorporation of the protocol in domestic law is desirable, it is not necessary for ratification or implementation of the Maastricht treaty.' Being right this time may not be well received. Labour's amendment was tabled in May 1992; the government should have thought of yesterday's formulation long before now. Yet the penalty may be no more than a prolongation of the irascible season in parliament. In the end Mr John Major must ratify the Maastricht treaty, and he must do it straight. He may play parliamentary games but he cannot make use of what would be seen as a dodgy constitutional device. These imperatives are self-evident. If the prime minister does not get his treaty through he will have failed in every European endeavour he has undertaken since, as chancellor, he floated the notion of the 'hard ecu'. Far from placing Britain at the heart of Europe, he would have presided over its collapse into the North Sea. With such a record the question of his survival in office would become irrelevant. There would quite simply be no point to him. Using the royal prerogative in what would be a questionable attempt to side-step parliament might save the treaty, but only at the cost of Mr Major's reputation for honesty and plain dealing. Payment of such a price would leave him politically bankrupt. Yesterday's statement by Mr Hurd need not have that effect. As the foreign secretary said, the important test is the third reading, when the Commons, if true to past form, will vote overwhelmingly in favour of the bill as it then stands, with or without amendment number 27. The treaty can then be ratified in the name of the Queen. There is nothing odd here. All international agreements of such importance are signed in the names of the heads of the participating states. Sitting at a table in Maastricht on February 7 1992 the German foreign and finance ministers, then Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher and Mr Theodor Waigel, signed the 'Treaty on European Union' on behalf of the president of the federal republic. Chancellor Helmut Kohl's name does not appear; yet his government had to seek the assent of both houses of parliament for what were rightly regarded as alterations in Germany's basic law. It was more complicated in France. Messrs Roland Dumas and Pierre Beregovoy signed for President Francois Mitterrand. What followed next was peculiarly French. The 'Conseil Constitutionel' ruled that the treaty required changes in the French constitution. Parliament assented to those on May 25 1992. The required majority in such cases is three-fifths of the votes of both houses sitting together. On July 1 the president used his powers to seek ratification of the treaty by means of referendum. In the US the power to make treaties is vested in the president, acting with the advice and consent of two-thirds of the Senate. Even that is not unlimited; the Supreme Court has repeatedly asserted the supremacy of the US constitution over any treaty. If a future president tries to develop the North American Free Trade Agreement into some kind of political union with Canada and Mexico it will be necessary to win the votes of two-thirds of both houses of Congress, plus three-quarters of the states. Mr Hurd's problem, and Mr Major's, is that in Britain there is no written constitution to tell them what to do. Their bill provides, in three short paragraphs, for the incorporation into British law of the deals done by the government excepting those relating to co-operation in foreign and security policy or justice and home affairs matters. This is logical. Where a law needs changing to suit the treaty, as do the European Communities Act of 1972 and the European Parliamentary Elections Act of 1978, a parliamentary vote is required. Where no change is needed, no new law is needed. The foreign secretary should have been clever enough to have said all that in the first place.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] In an interview with KURDISTAN NWAY, which will be  published tomorrow, Wednesday, brother Jalal Talabani, secretary  general of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK], said  disarmament is essential. He added: We hope that Kurdistan  will become a region where only the regular forces carry arms in  defense of our borders.    Asked to comment on Kurdistan Democratic Party leader Mas'ud  Barzani's proposal for the disarmament of Iraq's Kurdistan and  its protection by the international community, brother Talabani  said the PUK is ready to take the necessary steps to implement  this sacred objective. He added: It is essential that we  ourselves take this step under the supervision of the Kurdistan  region government. We could form a committee made up of the  interior minister, minister of the peshmerga affairs, and the  director of the police corps to achieve this objective, he added.    Brother Talabani pointed out that expediting the  normalization of the situation and ensuring the return of  security and order to the sons of our people in Kurdistan would  contribute to creating the atmosphere and necessary grounds for  establishing the rule of law, democracy, and human rights.</p>

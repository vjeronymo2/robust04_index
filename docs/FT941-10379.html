			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Sterling falls sharply against leading currencies Sterling fell sharply yesterday against leading currencies after Tuesday's quarter-point cut in UK base rates and against a background of political problems for the government. In London the pound closed at DM2.5708, more than 4 pfennigs lower than its level before the rate cut and 2 1/2 pfennigs down on the day. It eased further in New York to DM2.5672. Against the dollar it fell just under a cent to Dollars 1.4605 in London, and closed at the same level in New York. Mr Steve Hannah, chief economist at IBJ International, commenting on the cut, said: 'This has not come across as a convincing, well-planned move.' Many City traders complained they were unable to understand government policy which eased rates while releasing a report indicating that inflation could move up. The FT-SE 100 share index fell by 36.5 points before recovering to finish 11.1 points lower at 3,429.1. UK long gilts finished about  1/3 -point down. Before the US and UK interest rate changes, sterling had been at recent peaks against the dollar and D-Mark. It touched DM2.62 last month, a high since it left the ERM in September 1992 and reached its highest level against the dollar since October.

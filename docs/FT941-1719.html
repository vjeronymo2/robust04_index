			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Pension alarm brings a subdued response When the storm over mis-selling of personal pensions to people transferring out of occupational schemes broke last December the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulator, took the lead in urging investors not to panic. Mr Andrew Large, SIB chairman, insisted that those who bought private pension plans need take no urgent action. Many in the life industry muttered that it was SIB itself, by its handling of the pilot study showing widespread non-compliance with regulators' standards, that had increased the prospect of a panic by investors. Three months on, however, although several cases have received great publicity, there is little evidence of widespread customer unease in respect of the estimated 500,000 pension transfers. Mr David Linnell, compliance officer of Prudential, the UK's largest life company, said that advertisements placed since last December attracted only about 230 responses. He said that perhaps as many again came in to Prudential through other channels. TSB Life took an even more pro-active stance in its efforts to reassure. It wrote to all 44,000 of its pension transfer customers, receiving 1,400 letters and calls in reply seeking further information. Allied Dunbar, the financial services subsidiary of BAT, which is estimated to have about 50,000 pension transfers, said it had received about 150 queries. Even the high profile taken by SIB has attracted only a few hundred letters. In spite of the best efforts of the life industry the rarity of customer responses cannot be attributed entirely to high levels of satisfaction and confidence in the advice given. Legal &amp; General, which is estimated to have a similar number of cases, said it had received only a few queries. It suggested this might be because people who took out personal pensions were likely to feel more confident of their pension - even now - than if they had not made their own arrangements. Other theories are more ominous. Allied Dunbar said that many people might be waiting for the SIB report on compensation to be published in the summer, as Mr Large suggested, and that the number of inquiries would rise after that. Also less positive is the suggestion that people may have turned for advice to the occupational schemes they left rather than to the agents through whom they transferred. But perhaps most important, and admitted by the life industry to be a factor in the sales process, is people's reluctance to consider their future financial position, especially if they are some way off retirement. The life industry is taking comfort from the absence of reaction. In the end, however, compensation will have to be paid to all who have suffered from following poor advice - whether they realise this or not - and it will be up to the industry to ensure that this happens.</p>

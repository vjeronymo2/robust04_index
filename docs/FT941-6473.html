			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / US inflation fear hits markets: Unexpected increase in economic expansion marred by sharp price rises International bond and stock markets fell heavily yesterday after a closely watched US economic index showed some sharp increases in manufacturing costs. At the same time, the US government reported that gross domestic product in the final quarter of last year rose at a revised real annual rate of 7.5 per cent, far above the 5.9 per cent preliminary estimate and the largest quarterly expansion since the first three months of 1984. The bond market, however, was far more influenced by the price data from the National Association of Purchasing Managers monthly survey. Although its composite index fell only slightly to 56.6 per cent from 57.7 per cent in January, indicating continued healthy expansion, the association's price index surged to 67 per cent from 59.8 per cent the previous month. Renewed inflation fears left the US benchmark 30-year bond down more than 1 1/2 points by late afternoon, with the yield rising to 6.782 per cent. It was the largest one-day decline in US bond prices for six months. European bond markets fell sharply on the back of the US sell-off. New York traders said investors were selling bonds because they believed any sign of resurgent inflation would increase the likelihood of another monetary policy tightening by the Federal Reserve. The US central bank last tightened policy by pushing up short-term interest rates on February 4. The selling in the bond market spread to the stock market, where investors were equally perturbed by the prospect of another Fed rate rise. At one stage the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down more than 40 points, but by the close it had rallied to end down 22.79 at 3,809.23. The setback in bond markets drove share prices lower in London in an effective rerun of Thursday's rout. The FT-SE 100 Index closed at the lowest point of the day, down 57.5 at 3,270.6. Trading volume in the stock market remained fairly moderate, however, and the pressure again focused on stock index futures. Continental equity markets were also heavily marked down after the US figures, with the CAC-40 index in Paris retreating more than 2 per cent and the German Dax index of leading shares sliding 1 per cent during official hours and another 2 per cent in after-hours trading. The revised US GDP figures brought real annual growth to 3 per cent in 1993, the best since the 3.9 per cent of 1988. More than half of the upward revision was accounted for by exports, which grew at a 20.5 per cent annual rate in the quarter and outstripped the recalculated 16.2 per cent expansion in imports. The overall thrust of the Purchasing Managers survey was also bullish. The report noted that 'the strength in new orders strongly suggests future continued growth, but very likely at a lower, more sustainable level'. Increases in prices, it said, were 'primarily in products whose prices were severely depressed', such as aluminium, brass, copper, nickel and zinc. Of the component parts of the index, both new orders and the backlog in orders grew in February, but at a lower rate than in January. New export orders rose to the highest level in 4 1/2 years, while import orders also grew, but at a lower rate than in plier deliveries were at the highest level since June 1988, indicating strong demand from manufacturers. The government's GDP report for the final quarter also showed broad-based strength, together with low inflation.

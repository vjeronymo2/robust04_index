Zanegin, doctor of historical sciences: </F> "Trump Card: American-Chinese Relations on the Geopolitical  Scales"]    [Text] Great revolutions usually attract attention by their  social, domestic, and international repercussions. Yet such  cataclysms change fundamentally not only the social but also the  geopolitical picture of the world. The Chinese people's  revolution is undoubtedly such. It led the Chinese people onto  the path of socialist building and in less than half a century  of complex, zigzag-like development raised China, this  semicolonial country in the recent past, to the level of  structure-forming value of the modern world order.    The victory of the revolution caused a fundamental change in  China's international position. In line with the strengthening  of popular-democratic statehood and the successes in economic  building, China's importance in world politics grew. But decades  passed before, in our time, on the frontier of the 21st century,  the geopolitical potential of the Chinese revolution began to  manifest itself comprehensively and in full. For this to happen  it took transition to a qualitatively different level of the  basic indicators of domestic, primarily economic, development.  There was, in addition, a regrouping of international forces  which brought about the need for a restoration of the  geopolitical balance upset by the breakdown of the coalition of  socialist countries, the disintegration of the Soviet Union, and  the present Russian administration's abandonment of the mission  of maintenance of the geopolitical balance, strategic stability,  and general peace bequeathed it by history.    As a result, irrespective of how Beijing sees the country's  future international role, socialist China, by virtue of its  geopolitical size, military power (availability of a deterrent  nuclear arsenal), political status (permanent membership of the  UN Security Council), and social attractiveness for a large  group of countries, is already changing from the status of  regional power to a center of power of a global order and a  factor of deterrence and geopolitical balance, replacing in this  sense the former Soviet Union, and now also Russia, which is  incapable as yet of occupying the place of a structure-forming  value in the world geopolitical equation. The aspiration to  balance is a law of international (geopolitical) interaction, it  would seem. It may be recognized by a state or states and then  becomes, as has been the case repeatedly in the history of  international relations, the basis of a particular type of  policy. But even when this does not occur, a trend toward  balance is inevitably manifested, irrespective of the political  wishes of this subject of the international process or the  other, so that it might at any moment become a political  reality. There are signs that it is China that could perform an  appreciable role in the process of the formation of a new  strategic balance and geopolitical stability and in the creation  of that new system of international relations that will  inevitably emerge from the present chaos.    This prospect seems quite certain. How China's socioeconomic  and political system might evolve in our time is another matter.  It is hard also to foresee of what significance China will be  for Russia in its new geopolitical capacity. But this will  depend to a large extent on Russia.    A substantial part of our country to the east of Baykal  belongs to the Pacific geopolitical theater. The prospects of  the development of this part of Russia will depend to an  appreciable extent on its economic integration in the  Asia-Pacific economic space which is taking shape, in its  northeast subregion particularly. In connection with the loss of  important ports in the seas of the Atlantic there is growing  significance for Russia as a whole in the maritime areas of the  Far East with convenient harbors ensuring an entry to the  Pacific. There is every reason to suppose that Russian strategy  will in time have to be paying the main attention to the  Asia-Pacific direction, if, of course, Russia is destined to  develop in accordance with its position of world power linking  by the continental Eurasian spaces the Atlantic with the  Pacific, Europe with Asia, and West with East.    Nor can we close our eyes to the fact that in Moscow's  natural, traditional geopolitical movement eastward present-day  Russia is encountering resistance on the part of maritime  Pacific powers--the United States and Japan--which are by no  means interested in the appearance in the Pacific of a new  strategic value or simply a competitor even.    Under these conditions the significance of China and  good-neighbor relations with it for the future of Russia should  not evoke the least doubts. Land borders extending for thousands  of kilometers separate densely populated and industrially  developed areas of China from desert and backward areas of  Russia. A population of more than 1 billion seeking points of  contact for its forces, a dynamic, enterprising, and relatively  stable state which is prepared to defend its values and which  possesses all the necessary instruments for this--it is with  such a China that Russia will have to deal under the conditions  of the inevitable loss of illusions apropos the West and the  highly ponderable probability of the development of rivalry with  the United States.    Yet the approach of Russia, meaning the present political  leadership, is oriented, as it were, toward a complication of  Russian-Chinese relations for many years to come. It is  sufficient to say that the "Concept of Foreign Policy of the  Russian Federation" recommends that we build relations with  China with consideration of "the differences in ideology and  social and political systems." This same document, on the same  page, outlines the prospect of "strategic partnership" with the  United States in the Asia-Pacific region based on a "commitment  to common democratic values."    Corresponding to these aims is foreign policy practice: The  search for pragmatic advantages and the deals that are being  concluded conceal only somewhat the malevolent approach, colored  with ideological intolerance, of the Russian regime to relations  with a most important state occupying a key position in the  Asia-Pacific region and moving toward the level of global  geopolitical interaction.    It would seem that the possibility of the appearance of a  new  geopolitical rival of such a scale is beginning to trouble the  United States also. This is manifested, specifically, in  American foreign policy assertiveness in the new states on  China's periphery. Washington, clearly disturbed by China's  growing strategic importance, is seeking geopolitical levers for  containing Chinese communism. It is hoped to entrust the brunt  of this task to Russia, evidently. Washington's confidence that  Russia's radical democrats will further America's plans to  loosen the socialist system in China and direct this country's  development in accordance with the East European or Russian  model is easily divined here. If these plans fail, Russia, which  borders China, would have to draw onto itself the main Chinese  forces and, in the event of a conflict, involve its soldiers in  a war for others' interests. The United States itself here,  separated from the Asian continent by ocean expanses, where it  has, in addition, decisive superiority in naval forces, would  remain aloof from the bloodshed.    An analogy suggests itself: At the start of the 1970's also  the American side attempted to gain superiority to the Soviet  Union by playing the "China card." In just the same way in our  time Russia has been assigned the role of trump card in the  geopolitical game upon which Washington has embarked for the  purpose of depriving China of the fruits of the socialist  revolution, which has converted this once backward country into  an international factor of world significance.</p>

			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / Survey of Azerbaijan (5): Between Russia, Turkey and Asia - Diplomacy and power politics on the Caspian Sea The basic pillars of Azerbaijani foreign policy are to balance its interests between Russia and Turkey in the first place; to increase its developing contacts with Western states, using the leverage of its Caspian Sea oil; to remain on good but not close relations with neighbouring Iran, where millions of Azeris also live; to continue membership of the Commonwealth of Independent States, and to develop, especially, better relations with the Central Asian states, which are, like Azerbaijan, moderately Moslem. These new objectives, expounded by President Heydar Aliev and Mr Vafa Gulizade, his adviser on foreign affairs, are meant to address two issues. First and most urgently, they are seen as a way of achieving a ceasefire in the undeclared war with Armenia - a conflict that Armenia has in the last two years been winning. It is Azerbaijan's view that only Russia is capable of stopping the war - arguing that Moscow is making it possible for Armenia to fight. Says Mr Gulizade: 'Armenia receives 90 per cent of its supplies from Russia, and thus Russia could stop her in a minute. As soon as Russia threatens supplies, Armenia will negotiate.' A ceasefire has presently been arranged, under Russian auspices (by Gen. Pavel Grachev, the Russian defence minister). This tentative agreement is supposed to be followed by talks between Mr Aliev and Mr Levan Ter-Petrosian, the Armenian president, probably also in Moscow. Mr Aliev, in an interview, was sceptical: 'We have had so many ceasefires. In many of them, the Armenians used the time to again attack. I am not against the Russian initiative but our key demand is that the Armenians withdraw.' In invoking Russian aid to settle the war, Mr Aliev is, as he knows well, being drawn into a complex negotiation. Russia will settle the wars along its borders at a price. One is a share of a rich Azerbaijani oil deal led by British Petroleum (see article on oil), in addition to the right to establish new military installations. When the latter question was put to Mr Aliev, he claimed, 'The issue has not come up before me.' Mr Gulizade is a little more forthcoming: 'In principle I'm not against it. The world in which we live is a world of realities. And in the real world, countries can lease bases in other countries. There is nothing against it.' Turkey, on the other hand - 'a brother country', as Mr Gulizade calls it - has less obvious political influence but more of a goal to which Azerbaijan can strive. In a February trip to Ankara, Mr Aliev won the important declaration from Turkey's leadership that he was a valued friend. This was vital because, since he was instrumental in the fall of Mr Abulfaz Elchibey, the previous president who was decidedly pro-Turkish, Mr Aliev needed to ensure that relations with Ankara were not too raw. In addition, there is grave concern in Ankara about Russia's ambitions in the largely Turkic, former Soviet republics of Azerbaijan and Central Asia. Ankara, which until recently was viewed as the west's bulwark in Central Asia and the Caucasus, believes with some cause that Russia is trying to bully its way into the region and push Turkey out. Azerbaijan's key politicians agree that much of the republic's future is dependent on how Russia asserts its perceived rights in its 'near abroad.' 'If Russia's policy doesn't moderate, and the west doesn't become a balancing force in this region, we realise there is going to be a problem for Azerbaijan - for any government of Azerbaijan,' said Mr Isa Gambar, leader of the opposition Mussawat political party. The West is seen by Mr Aliev as 'the natural direction of our policy'. He says that 'we share similar values - a belief in democracy, in the rule of law and in the market system. We must build the culture of these here and for that we will need assistance'. The long-sought oil agreement is key to most of Azerbaijan's plans, both political and economic. The currently discussed Dollars 250m signing bonus from the BP-led western consortium would offer Mr Aliev immediate tools to improve his influence at home and abroad. Domestically, he is still widely respected and has a commanding presence, but he needs to start delivering tangible achievements. On foreign policy, it has not gone unnoticed in Baku that the huge oil contracts already signed in the neighbouring Caspian Sea state of Kazakhstan have helped give its president, Mr Nursultan Nazarbaev, access to the highest power circles abroad. Mr Nazarbaev, for example, recently returned from a successful visit to Washington where he was granted almost Dollars 400m in assistance. Azerbaijan leaders hope the oil agreement will gain them similar western aid. Together with religion, energy is the main common bond between Azerbaijan and its neighbours across the Caspian Sea. The region's natural gas and oil wealth links energy inextricably with its political future. This makes a Central Asian-Azerbaijan alliance vital, particularly an increase in trade across the Caspian. Thus far, however, Caucasia and Central Asia have had very differing political cultures. Conservative Central Asia was remarkably free of anti-Soviet campaigns, unlike the Caucasus which saw widescale anti-Soviet protest movements. Air traffic between Baku and Central Asia's key hub, the Uzbekistan capital of Tashkent, has been severed for more than a year. The breach began when Azerbaijan allowed an Uzbek political opposition figure to stay in Baku after he was assaulted in Tashkent. Azerbaijan leaders have tended to take a far more lenient posture toward political rivalry than have Central Asia's presidents. This is part of Azerbaijan's paradox - its resources and political character could give it a smooth eventual transition into a country that can do business with a wide range of Asian and western nations. But its strategic location on the edge of the Moslem world and the former Soviet southern rim makes it a highly tempting target for Russian ambitions.</p>

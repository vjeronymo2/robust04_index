			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / People (Names in the News): Sons bring Ziff back to zero On Bill Ziff's retirement earlier this year, Wired, the trendy San Francisco magazine, described him as 'the most powerful unknown publisher in America, but arguably the most powerful man in computing', writes Louise Kehoe. Just a few weeks later, Ziff's high-tech publishing empire was put on the block by his three sons, who announced that they had no interest in following their father's footsteps but would instead form an investment firm. Over the past few days the wishes of the Ziffs junior have been fulfilled. Most of the assets of Ziff Communications have been sold off in three parcels for about Dollars 2bn. The sales mark the end of a decade in which the name Ziff has become synonymous with influence in the personal computer industry. When Ziff publications praised a new product, it was a sure fire success. When they panned it, it was all but dead. The success of Ziff's publishing business is all the more remarkable because it was built from the scraps of a much broader publishing group that included magazines about cars, hi-fi and many other special interests. In 1982, Bill Ziff was diagnosed as having terminal cancer. He sold off most of the assets of the business, founded by his father, that he had built up over the previous 29 years for Dollars 712.5m. But buyers showed little interest in the company's fledgling computer magazines. Despite his doctors' negative prognoses, Bill Ziff recovered his health and built the remnants of his family business into a new publishing empire focused on the computer industry. The Ziff family is 'delighted' by the terms of the sale of its businesses, Dirk Ziff, the oldest of the sons said last week. It is hard to imagine, however, that Bill Ziff does not regret his sons' decision not to carry on the publishing dynasty.</p>

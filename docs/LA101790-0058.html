			<p><P> October 17, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> WELL REACTIVATED AT COUNTY CENTER  </P> <P> The County Board of Supervisors decided Tuesday to reactivate a well at the  County Government Center in Ventura because the county exceeded a city-imposed  water limit last summer.  </P> <P> Because of heavy watering at the center, the county used nearly 2 million  gallons over the water limit imposed last spring by Ventura as a  drought-fighting measure.  </P> <P> The well, in operation from 1932 to 1982, doesn't meet drinking water standards  because of its salt content, said Peter S. Pedroff, director of the county's  General Services Agency. But it could be used for irrigation and to cut down on  the county's need for potable city water, he said. The well could be in  operation by November at a cost of about $25,000, he said.  </P> <P> The well water must be used generously, he said, because its salt content could  damage grass, plants and trees if too little is used.  </P> <P> Signs would be installed to tell passers-by that the county isn't wasting  drinking water to irrigate county grounds.  </P> <P> Pedroff said the county stayed under its city water allocation during the last  billing period, which ended Monday, because of several water-conservation  practices that were imposed.

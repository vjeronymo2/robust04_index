The World Petroleum Congress, an international oil  representative organization, was founded in London, England, in  1933 and has 40 major members from oil producers and consumers.  The World Petroleum Congress, which is held every four years,  has become an important international event that attracts utmost  attention from petroleum companies worldwide. China won the bid  to host the 15th congress in March of 1993 and will host the  grand gathering of worldwide oil industries in Beijing in  October 1997.    In his congratulatory letter, Premier Li Peng said: "The  World Petroleum Congress is a large-scale and high-level  international scientific conference with wide-ranging topics and  great influence. China is happy to host the 15th World Petroleum  Congress in Beijing. Hosting this congress fully represents the  achievements of China's petroleum and petrochemical industries  in developing oil-related science and technology. I believe  this meeting will strengthen the scientific and cultural  exchanges and cooperation of world petroleum and petrochemical  industries, and it will have a significant and profound bearing  on China's further opening up and promotion of the socialist  modernization."    Zou Jiahua, vice premier of the State Council, attended the  inaugural meeting and gave an important speech. He said: To  convene the 15th World Petroleum Congress in Beijing is a  significant event for both Beijing Municipality and China,  reflecting that China's petroleum and petrochemical industries  have reached the world's forefront. The continuous and stable  development of China's petroleum and petrochemical industries is  inseparable from acquiring and developing advanced technology.  The World Petroleum Congress provides us a good opportunity to  learn from and conduct exchanges with international  counterparts. Moreover, it will promote further cooperation. He  hoped that all sides concerned would coordinate well with one  another and accomplish various preparatory tasks carefully and  thoroughly to make this congress a success.

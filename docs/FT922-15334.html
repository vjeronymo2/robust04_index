			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Kuwait to bail out banks with bond sale KUWAIT's consultative assembly yesterday approved a plan to clear the emirate's commercial banks of Dollars 20bn (Pounds 11.5bn) of bad debts through an exceptional sale of government bonds. The National Council's long-awaited approval, by a vote of 41 to 14 with two abstentions, has no legal power in itself, but had been sought by the government to give the debt buy-out political credibility. Kuwait's banks and companies have been waiting for final clearance of the plan before they can produce accounts for the period since Iraq's invasion in August 1990. It is widely seen, therefore, as a prerequisite to kick-starting Kuwait's post-war economy. About a quarter of the debt has lain on the books of Kuwait's commercial banks since the catastrophic crash of the informal Souq al Manakh stock market in 1982. Under the plan, the banks will receive bonds to the value of the debt, which will then be taken over by the government. Debtors will then have 20 years to repay. However, each debtor will have to produce accounts to allow an assessment of their ability to repay, and at what rates of interest. Critics of the plan say this will discourage debtors from revealing their full assets while at the same time doing nothing to trim the vast bureaucracy in Kuwait's financial system which has been struggling with the Souq al Manakh bad debts for the past decade. Force may be needed to make Iraq respect Kuwait's border, the emirate's envoy to the United Nations said in a recent newspaper interview, Reuter reports from Kuwait. Mr Mohammed Abu al-Hassan told the Al-Anbaa daily Iraq had set up several border posts inside Kuwait's territory in a clear breach of the Gulf War ceasefire agreement.</p>

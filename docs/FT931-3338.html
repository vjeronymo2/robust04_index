			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / International Company News: Swire doubles its stake in Fraser Brokers SWIRE Pacific, part of the Hong Kong-based aviation-to-property group, is to increase its stake in Fraser Insurance Brokers, a London insurance and reinsurance broker, to 80 per cent. Fraser, in which Swire bought 40 per cent in 1991, will now be known as the Swire Fraser Group. Swire will pay Fraser's existing shareholders a percentage of profits earned by the broker over the next three years in return for the extra holding. No further details of the transaction were made available. Fraser specialises in a number of London market areas, including reinsurance, financial insurances and stop-loss policies - personal reinsurance policies bought by Lloyd's Names. The group was formed in 1986.</p>

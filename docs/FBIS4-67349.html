			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Xu Shangxiang [5171 1424 3276]: "An Alarm: </F> Harmful Effects of Acid Rain Expanding in China"]    [Excerpts] In recent years, the harmful effects of acid  rain in China have been expanding. In 1992, the amount of sulfur  dioxide emitted into the atmosphere surpassed 17 million tons,  and surveys indicate that a quarter of the cities in northern  China have atmospheric sulfur dioxide concentrations above the  permissible level of 0.15 mg/m[.sup]3[/]. In southern China,  the acidity of precipitation is increasing perceptibly, and the  area subject to acid rain, which originally was confined to the  Chongqing-Guiyang and Nanchang-Changsha regions, now includes  the Fuzhou-Xiamen, Changzhou-Shanghai-Hangzhou, and  Qingdao-Jinan areas. The harmful effects of acid rain are now  among the ten major environmental problems facing China's  modernization.    1. Destruction of Forests. Before acid rain reaches the  ground, it damages the leaves of trees, causing them to become  yellow, gradually lessening their photosynthetic ability,  leaching out nutrients, and causing the leaves to wither and  fall. When acid rain enters the soil, it dissolves inorganic  nutrients, leaches them away, and also decreases the amounts of  organic matter in the soil, thus decreasing soil fertility. Acid  rain also hinders root development, retards the growth of trees,  and decreases their resistance to disease and insect pests, with  the result that large areas of forest are killed. In the  mid-1980's, precipitation in Sichuan had become significantly  acid (in 1989 the pH of rain in Chongqing had fallen to 4.21),  and acid rain was abundant in the Chengdu and Chongqing regions;  as a result, the huashan pines at Fengjie, the firs of Mount  Emei, and the masson pines in the hills south of Chongqing have  been damaged over an area of more than 100,000 mu.    2. Corrosion of Buildings and Structures. Acid rain can  react  chemically with limestone, sandstone, concrete, and metals. The  resulting corrosion damages or defaces buildings, statues, and  cultural relics. It has been reported in the press that owing to  the effects of acid rain the Leshan Buddha, the largest statue  of the Buddha in the world, is already seriously affected: its  face is pitted, its nose is blackened, its body is wasting away,  material has been lost from the hands, feet and shoulders, and  the outer garment is being worn away, making urgent measures  necessary. High-voltage electric transmission lines, railways,  metal bridges, motor vehicles and skyscrapers are being corroded  by acid rain, which decreases their service life and  necessitates more frequent repair. Surveys in Guangdong and  Guangxi provinces found that the cost of rustproofing metal  equipment such as that described above exceeds 100 million yuan.    In addition, acid rain causes corrosion or fading of paints  and organic coatings, weakens fabrics and causes them to fade,  ages rubber and plastic, and degrades and destroys paper  products, thus decreasing or eliminating their utility value.    3. Dying Lakes. Although no acidification of lakes has yet  been found in China, bicarbonate levels in some reservoirs of  the Jiajiang, Danleng and Mingshan regions (covering about 5,000  square kilometers) have fallen to 0.5 meq/liter  [milliequivalents per liter]; in the Zigong, Rongxian, Wanxian,  Liangping, and Zhijiang regions (about 8,000 square kilometers),  bicarbonate levels in some reservoirs are between 0.5 and 1.0  meq/liter. Under the international Gallway standard, water  bodies with bicarbonate levels below 0.5 meq/liter are  classified as sensitive to acidification; those with bicarbonate  levels above 0.5 meq/liter are classified as not sensitive to  acidification. Thus, the first group of reservoirs mentioned  above is sensitive to acidification: owing to their low  bicarbonate levels, they have a weak buffer capacity for  resisting acidification and a latent proneness to acidification.  The latter group of reservoirs is potentially sensitive. Thus,  the problem of acidification of lakes must not be ignored.    4. Decreased Crop Yields. When acid rain falls, the leaves  of  crops are the first to be damaged. Rusty spots appear on them  and they turn yellow. Their absorptive ability and  photosynthetic ability are weakened, and the internal  organization of the leaves is damaged, resulted in the leaching  out of sugars, amino acids, and pectin and retarding their  growth. Acid rain also decreases the sprouting rate of seeds and  the root development of plants; and because the absorptive  ability of soils is decreased, seedling growth is slow and crop  yields fall. On 15 March 1979, a fall of acid rain that occurred  in a zone including the Fenghuang, Changsha and Xiangtan areas  of Hunan Province and the Songtao region of Guizhou Province  caused a major decline in crop yields over an area of 350 square  kilometers.    Acid rain leaches such inorganic components as potassium,  calcium and magnesium from the soil and can decompose rock,  alter soil components, accelerate the leaching of potassium and  magnesium and promote wind erosion of the soil; it can depress  the vital activity of microorganisms, slow the degradation of  organic matter, and cause a decline in soil fertility, which  also decreases crop yields. According to Ministry of Agriculture  statistics, 5.3 million hectares of agricultural land in China  is affected by acid rain and fluorine pollution, and the annual  loss of grain output exceeds 6.3 billion kilograms.    As the acidity of precipitation increases, toxic metals such  as aluminum, mercury, cadmium and lead can be leached from rocks  or the soil and can be absorbed by plants. Elevated cadmium  levels have been found in plants of the lettuce family. Toxic  metals in vegetables and fruits may not affect yields, but they  do lower the food value of produce and may make it inedible.</p>

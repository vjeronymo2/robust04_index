			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sections 251.13 to 152.16 prescribe the procedures to be followed in closed meetings, adopting virtually all of the former Tribunal's rules. Section 251.13 drops the requirement of closed meetings for internal personnel matters, since the Panels are without authority to hire or maintain personnel, but it adds to the discretion of the Panel to go into closed session to deliberate on a motion or objection raised orally at hearing. Section 251.16 directs that transcripts of closed meetings shall be kept at the Copyright Office, which is the official address for all arbitration proceedings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> 3. Subpart 3_Public Access to and Inspection of Records <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> As in subpart B, the copyright Office is proposing in subpart C to adopt the former Tribunal's rules with respect to public access to and inspection of records, but with some important changes. The range of documents available to the public is expanded. Section 251.21 provides that, with limited exceptions, all records of the Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panels, and also those of the Librarian of Congress assembled and/or created under 17 U.S.C. 801 and 802, are available for public inspection and copying. Thus, for example, rulings or decisions of the Librarian made before the convening of an Arbitration Panel would be publicly available. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The same difficulties raised by adoption of a single official address, as discussed above, also arise with respect to the location of documents. While all filings with a CARP required by the proposed rules must be submitted through the Copyright Office, certain documents other than filings may, during the course of a proceeding, be in the sole possession of a Panel. Example are a document admitted into evidence during the course of a hearing to impeach the testimony of a witness, or the transcript of an ongoing proceeding. Section 251.22 therefore specifies that all documents and records in the sole possession of a Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel and not required to be filed with the Copyright Office may be maintained by the chairperson at the location of the hearing, or at a location specified by the Panel. All requests for access, however, must be directed to the Copyright Office, and not the Arbitration Panel. In the case of documents solely in the possession of the Panel, the Copyright Office shall made arrangements to allow the person making the request to inspect and copy them. The schedule of fees for services of this sort are those currently charged by the Copyright Office for like services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the Copyright Office already has its own Freedom of Information Act and Privacy Act guidelines, see 37 CFR parts 203 and 204, it is not adopting the former Tribunal regulations related to those Acts. The Office acknowledges that some adjustments to those rules may be required by the peculiarities of the Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel system, but we believe there should be some practical experience before we identify any necessary changes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> 4. Subpart D_Standards of Conduct <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Office is not proposing any regulations at this time, but as part of this proceeding we are inquiring as to standards of conduct that should apply to the arbitrators. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> The Copyright Office is proposing to repeal subpart D, as it appeared in the former Tribunal's rules, and replace it with rules governing standards of conduct for arbitrators. Former subpart D contained Equal Employment Opportunity provisions for the Tribunal, which are no longer relevant for CARPs since they are without authority to hire personnel or maintain a staff. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> 5. Subpart E_Procedures of Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panels <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> As with so many of the rules of this subchapter, the new bifurcated system of the Reform Act requires some changes in the former Tribunal's rules governing the conduct of proceedings. Nevertheless, although consequential adjustments are needed, we believe that the over-all system of procedures long used by the Tribunal in rate adjustment and distribution proceedings have served the public interest well and should be preserved. Maintaining the Tribunal's system to the extent possible should reduce the learning process for parties that have appeared before the former Tribunal for many years and should also, we hope, avoid some confusion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Application of CARPs Procedures and Practice. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  For the most part the hearing procedures and motions practice applicable to the CARPs are carried over from those of the former Tribunal. Section 251.40 specifies that the procedural rules of this subpart E apply only to the Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panels and not to the actions of the Librarian or the Copyright Office, unless otherwise expressly provided in this subpart. The section also states that subpart E only applies to CARPs, and not to other arbitration proceedings under the Copyright Code. The Office is not statutorily required to apply these rules to other arbitration proceedings. Although it is possible that some or all of these rules may ultimately be adopted for other arbitration purposes; the statement clarifies the issue as of now and grants the Office flexibility in making future decisions on the point. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Formal Hearings and Other CARP Proceedings. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 251.41 direct the Panels to conduct formal hearings for rate adjustment and royalty distribution proceedings. All parties intending to participate in a hearing must file a notice of their intention to do so. The Panels are also allowed to conduct other proceedings in the exercise of their basic functions, subject to section 251.7. For example, in the course of a distribution controversy, a legal issue may arise which requires resolution before the proper distribution can be determined. The Panel could conduct a proceeding to resolve that issue, which would be part of its function in determining the distribution. It may also happen that resolution of the legal question will permit the parties to the proceeding to settle their differences, thereby avoiding the need for a Panel distribution determination. The Panel, however, is still subject to section 251.7, and could not conduct a rulemaking proceeding affecting any provisions of subpart E. Section 251.41 also recognizes that, in the interest of reducing the expense of litigation, some parties may wish to have their royalty entitlement or rate determined solely by written submissions, and a procedure for petitioning the Librarian to have a ``paper'' proceeding is provided. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Suspension or Waiver of Rules; Ad Hoc Procedures. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As noted above, although it is clear that the Arbitration Panels have no rulemaking authority, section 251.42 authorizes them to waive or suspend the rules of subpart E for purposes of a particular proceeding. This carries on a practice formerly used by the Tribunal, and allows the Panels flexibility in addressing the specific conditions and circumstances of each proceeding; if the Panels were not allowed this flexibility, the resulting procedural rigidity could produce injustices. In cases where subpart E is silent as to the correct procedure to be observed, the Panel may follow its own procedures, as long as they are consistent with the Administrative Procedure Act. However, as with suspension or waiver, the ad hoc procedures adopted by that Panel apply only to that particular proceeding and that particular Panel. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Brazil goes nuts for a new king: Christina Lamb meets three 'royals' as the country votes on whether to restore the monarchy AN EIGHTY-year-old man with caterpillar eyebrows, bushy moustache and a floppy felt hat, living in a candy pink and white palace in the mountains above Rio de Janeiro and speaking Portuguese with a thick French accent, Dom Pedro Gastao de Orleans e Braganca seems an unlikely threat to the Brazilian republic. But the great grandson of the country's last emperor, together with a radical right-wing recluse and a former surfer, is one of three eccentric candidates campaigning for Brazilians to vote for the restoration of the monarchy in a bizarre plebiscite on Wednesday. Dismissed by most politicians as 'maluco' or crazy, the so-called 'royal option' is drawing astonishing support from Brazilians fed up with a presidential republic which has left Latin America's biggest country with the world's worst income distribution, 1,500 per cent annual inflation and rampant corruption. Only one elected president has completed a mandate in the past 65 years, the rest opting out through suicide or resignation, dying before taking office, forced out by military coups or impeached, as in the case of the last President Fernando Collor. By contrast, the 67-year-long monarchy, cut short in 1889, is regarded as a golden era of stability and glory. After a century of prohibition of monarchist politics, tell-tale gold crown lapel pins are being sported by public figures as diverse as Paulo Protasio, the head of Rio's Chamber of Commerce, Mario Henrique Simonsen, a conservative former finance minister, Sandra de Sa, a left-wing folk singer and Dona Neuma, the first lady of Rio's oldest samba school. 'It's a natural choice for a country where social groups and events such as carnival always use 'king' to refer to something good and dignified,' says Roberto da Matta, one of Brazil's best-known sociologists and himself a monarchist. But the chances of Brazil reverting to its ancient title of kingdom are being weakened by a split in the House of Braganca, the Brazilian royal family. At the last count, there are a dozen imperial relatives with claims on the throne and little in common except for the Braganca name and bright blue eyes. Of the three leading contenders, Dom Pedro is the most senior member of the family and most direct descendant of the last emperor, Dom Pedro II. He divides his time between Seville in Spain and Brazil's royal winter capital of Petropolis, where he lives surrounded by oil paintings of his ancestors in a palace that used to be the emperor's guest house. Riding horseback along the cobbled streets, where he has long been a tourist attraction, Dom Pedro is also a popular figure among locals, who shout 'Long live the king]' as he passes. 'It is not that I am asking to be king but if it is my duty to save my people then I will,' says Dom Pedro, in between complaining about the difficulty of finding blacksmiths to shoe his English thoroughbred. Stressing that 'a monarch should protect his people against the government,' Dom Pedro refers to his nephew, Spain's King Juan Carlos, as providing who an 'extraordinary example'. Dom Pedro denies that monarchy would be a step back, asking: 'Is there a greater example of modernity than Japan, one of the most traditional monarchies in the world?' But his claim is jeopardised by the fact that his father renounced his rights to the then-defunct throne in 1908 in order to marry a Czech countess of non-royal lineage. His most serious rival is his cousin, 54-year-old Dom Luiz, whom Dom Pedro describes as 'a crazy fanatic who thinks going to the beach is a sin.' The oldest of 12 brothers, Dom Luiz is a member of a right-wing militant group called Tradition, Family, Property, which allegedly lit candles in support of military dictatorships in the 1960s and '70s. Although he ventures rarely from his modest apartment in Sao Paulo, Dom Luiz promises to break his vow of chastity and marry 'if it is necessary to produce heirs.' His eloquent lawyer brother, Dom Bertrand, who acts as his spokesman, says: 'The republic has brought nothing but political chaos and economic decadence. Under the monarchy, we were a first-world country with the world's second telephone and postage systems.' He claims that monarchy would be a cheap option for Brazil, and says: 'The running of (Britain's) Buckingham Palace costs only 20 per cent of Brazil's presidential palace running costs.' The most active candidate is 38-year-old Dom Joao Henrique, Dom Pedro's favourite nephew. Known as Little Prince Johnny, the glamorous former beach bum has swapped his surfing gear for European suits, and riding the waves of Bali for a hectic programme of talk shows and speeches. A regular figure in Rio's social columns, Dom Joao runs a hotel, the prince's guesthouse, and is a leading environmental photographer. Surrounded by royal memorabilia in his rented sea-front flat, where ancient leather-bound tomes jostle with modern art and jazz books, Dom Joao argues: 'The system is totally rotten. Even if you put an honest man in the presidency, it will not work because the president is elected and prisoner of political parties and economic interest groups. A king, by contrast, is impartial.' He adds: 'Restoring the monarchy will not achieve immediate miracles, such as reducing inflation or making food appear in the mouths of the hungry millions, but at least it would give stabilisation.' Were the royal option to prevail in the plebiscite, it would be left to the nation's congress to decide on who should be crowned - and it is there that Dom Joao's chance lies. Several political parties have already asked him to run for senator or congressman. But the mere fact that a big industrial country should, in the 1990s, even be contemplating restoring a monarchy that was unseated more than a century ago reflects tremendous disillusion with the present system. Public disgruntlement has increased in recent months as those named in the Collorgate corruption scandal continue to stay free to enjoy their wealth, Meanwhile, the new president, Itamar Franco, has got through a record three finance ministers in six months. With so many other problems to tackle, and a largely illiterate population, the farcical nature of the plebiscite was highlighted by an poll last week which found that 52 per cent of those questioned did not understand what they were voting for. Apart from choosing between monarchy and republicanism, Brazil's 90m voters must also decide between parliamentarianism and presidentialism, begging the question of what would happen if they vote for both presidentialism and monarchy. The level of confusion is illustrated by Marcia, the cleaner of the Financial Times' Brazil office, who says: 'I am going to vote for the king as president.'</p>

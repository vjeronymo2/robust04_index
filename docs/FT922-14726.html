			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Books: Serious Steiner PROOFS AND THREE PARABLES by George Steiner Faber &amp; Faber Pounds 5.99, 114 pages GEORGE STEINER is writing fiction again. How can one tell? Because this resembles everything else he writes: serious opinions trenchantly put. His thin new volume, Proofs and Three Parables, advances his slowly accreted critical thinking; these four stories are not narrative romps but allegories for argument and scripts for thought. Steiner believes that honest literary criticism is a passionate private experience seeking to persuade, and that its professional versions have about them neither rigour nor proof. His own criticism is everywhere driven by a strident liberalism which rightly refuses to forget the Holocaust. After Treblinka, when God is a shout in the street, criticism can do no better than remember. His brilliant Death of Tragedy (1961) stopped short, after elegant discussions of Corneille, Holderlin and the Greeks. On a train in Poland, Steiner hears of Russian officer prisoners eaten alive by the starved guard dogs of a retreating German army, the survivors shot by the liberating Russians lest the ranks see the abjection of their commanders; a woman tells of her sister in the Matthausen death-camp, but, says Steiner 'I will not set it down here, for it is the kind of thing under which language breaks.' With such knowledge, Steiner can write fiction in Proofs and Three Parables only by making it continuous with his politics. On May Day, 1981, Steiner lectured at Christ's College, Cambridge and punningly predicted the decline of Communism in Europe: then, May Day ('m'aider') was a cry for help. Now in 'Proofs', another cry: the 'Professore', a Marxist proof reader in Italy faces the collapse of messianic Marxism. This collapse tests the Western idealist more stringently than the Eastern pragmatist. Steiner works the problem through with long speeches from the Professore's reading-group in Marxist Revolutionary Theory and Praxis, and with the pointed allegory of failing eyesight (the Professore's left eye ceases to function). Soon, the Marxist group disintegrates: what then is to be done? The Professore joins the Communist Party, the PCI, only to discover that it has become the Party of the Democratic Left. The other stories include a bizarre version of Desert Island Discs and the volume concludes with a religious debate, 'Conversation Piece': how could God ask such a thing of Abraham? What did Sarah know? Can God play jokes? And why do men argue over scriptural authority? Proofs and Three Parables is not Steiner at his pellucid best, but if it sends one back to reread Language and Silence or In Bluebeard's Castle then it will have done enough.</p>

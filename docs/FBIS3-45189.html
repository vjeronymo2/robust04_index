			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [XINHUA commentator's article: "Ensure Payment for </F> Teachers' Overdue Salaries"]    [Text] Beijing, 12 Jan (XINHUA) -- The new year has  passed; however, in some localities teachers' overdue salaries  have not been paid. The Spring Festival is approaching, but  some teachers have not received payment for their work for the  entire year.    The State Education Commission recently disclosed to the  press that new progress has been made nationwide in paying the  overdue salaries of primary and middle school teachers.  However, ten provinces have made slow progress in this regard.    It goes without saying that delaying payment for teachers'  salaries is not allowed. Teachers put in a lot of hard work to  impart knowledge and educate people. Certainly they deserve  payment according to their work. No matter what causes the  delay, it is unbearable and unreasonable in terms of common  sense and reason. Today, when we value education and respect  teachers more and more, such absurd phenomenon must not occur.    In principle, the key to solving the problem lies in local  governments, particularly major leaders. According to the  regulations of China's "Compulsory Education Law," local party  committees and governments entrusted with developing China's  education are responsible for placing priority on developing  education and on truly respecting teachers and valuing  education; they also are responsible for taking resolute  measures to ensure local input into education. Among these  responsibilities is paying salaries to teachers in full and in a  timely manner.    Governments at all levels should pay close attention to  solving this payment arrears problem within a specified time.  This is not only an issue of attitude, but also relates to  China's educational development. Since the central authorities  repeatedly lay injunctions on localities to solve the problem of  teachers' overdue salaries, some localities have moved slowly or  even made various excuses to postpone action. This is  absolutely not allowed.    To strictly follow the arrangement made by the central  authorities' relevant departments, to adopt feasible measures,  and to ensure payment for teachers' overdue salaries by the  Spring Festival so middle and primary school teachers can enjoy  a happy Spring Festival -- these tasks should be handled  thoroughly and importantly by party and government departments  in those localities where teachers' overdue salaries have not  been paid yet.    It is hoped payment for teachers' salaries will no longer be  delayed.</p>

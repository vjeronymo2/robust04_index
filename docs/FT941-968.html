			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Coca-Cola faces Tokyo penalty tax The Japanese tax authorities have charged Coca-Cola Japan, a subsidiary of the world's largest soft drinks company, with a penalty tax bill of Y15bn (Pounds 96m) for improper income transfers. The country's National Tax Administration Agency has ruled that Y36bn in brand and marketing royalty payments, which Coca-Cola transferred to its US parent during the three years to March 1992, were too high. It has demanded an extra tax payment. Coca-Cola said the decision would not affect its earning prospects, due to likely tax redemptions in the US, but it made clear it would reject the demand. Mr Roi Suzuki, president of Coca-Cola Japan, said the royalties were based on the immeasurable value of Coca-Cola's trademark and were fair and reasonable. The Japanese decision comes amid rising anxiety over the US government's moves to tighten its tax grip on foreign multinationals operating in the US. Tax authorities there have claimed that multinationals often abuse international transfer price rules which state that goods and services sold from one group company to another should be priced as though sold to any outside company. By setting higher or lower transfer prices, multinational companies, including Japanese vehicle and electronics makers, are accused of shifting their US profits abroad to avoid US taxation. In 1992 the US Internal Revenue Service ruled that Kawasaki Heavy Industries had been avoiding US taxes and charged itY1.2bn. Last year Nissan Motor paid Y17bn in penalty taxes.</p>

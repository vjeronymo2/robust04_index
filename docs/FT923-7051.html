			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / International Company News: Nordbanken shake-up will cut staff by 1,400 NORDBANKEN, Sweden's ailing state-owned bank, yesterday announced a group re-organisation plan which included a cut in staff by 1,400 people over the next 18 months. The bank's short-term aim was to cut its costs drastically, introduce substantial savings and improve its customer services with the eventual objective of being privatised, according to Mr Hans Dalborg, the bank's chief executive. In May, the Swedish government was forced to rescue Nordbanken with a SKr20bn (Dollars 3.76bn) financial package of guarantees and loans and it will become the sole owner of the bank at the end of this month. In the first four months of the year the bank suffered a SKr1.97bn operating loss due to bad debts and non-performing loan provisions and its financial position remains precarious. Nordbanken said it planned to widen share ownership in Carnegie, the group's investment and stockbroking arm as part of an aim to focus the bank more on its activities inside Sweden. Institutions, individuals and Carnegie's customers are invited to buy shares in the subsidiary which will be floated on the stock market. Nordbanken remains a minority shareholder. Carnegie operates in eight countries and is wholly-owned by Nordbanken. Jyske Bank, Denmark's fourth biggest banking group, expects a pre-tax loss for 1992 after posting a DKr479m (Dollars 85m) deficit for the first half of 1992. The bank gave no estimate for the expected full-year result but forecast a positive performance for the rest of 1992. The bank last year reported a DKr178m pre-tax profit. It attributed its disappointing first-half result to difficult trading conditions in the Danish finance sector, coupled with high interest rates and a slump in domestic private demand and business activity.</p>

			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: The radical Liberals - The Election and You / The Lib Dem's far-reaching tax plan IF YOU WANT radicalism, vote Liberal Democrat. The party's plans include a complete overhaul of the tax and social security systems, setting them apart from the Tories and Labour. Sceptics might argue that as the third party, the Liberal Democrats have the luxury of putting forward ambitious plans they know they are unlikely to have to implement. The broad aim is to create a simpler and fairer system of taxation and pensions to benefit those on low incomes at the cost of the very wealthy. What follows is a broad summary of the main ideas. Income tax and National Insurance: These taxes are to be integrated into one. The 20 per cent tax band introduced by Norman Lamont would be abolished and 1p added to the basic rate of tax, making it 26p. Those earning up to Pounds 33,000 would pay 35 per cent tax on income (26 per cent in income tax and 9 per cent National Insurance); at Pounds 33,000 up to Pounds 50,000, the rate would be 42 per cent (33 per cent income tax and 9 per cent NIC); those earning over Pounds 50,000 would pay 50 per cent (41 per cent income tax and 9 per cent NIC). The party estimates that 80 per cent of taxpayers would fall into the first band. Pensioners and small savers would be entirely exempt from NIC. VAT: Would be reduced by 0.5 per cent in 1993/4 and a further 0.5 per cent in 1995/6. Personal allowances: These would eventually be replaced by a tax credit system. Individuals now deduct their personal allowance from their earnings to obtain their taxable income. This benefits higher rate taxpayers in particular because the allowance reduces that element of their earnings which is taxed at the top rate. Under the Liberal Democrats, tax would be calculated on gross earnings. The 'tax credit' would then be deducted from this figure. The effect would be to equalise the worth of the tax credit between the various tax bands. Married couple's allowance: This would be frozen and the Chancellor's proposal to allow its transferability adhered to. Capital Gains Tax: Radical reform again. The system of CGT exemptions would be removed. A lower CGT threshold would be established but there would be some transferability of allowances between income and capital gains. Inheritance Tax: Like Labour, the Liberal Democrats want to reform this tax to make the beneficiary, and not the estate, liable for IHT. You would be given a Pounds 50,000 IHT exemption. If it is used up, you would then be granted a Pounds 5,000 annual allowance which would roll-up for 10 years. So the maximum IHT exemption at any one time for an individual would be Pounds 50,000. The aim is to encourage wider distribution of wealth. If you left Pounds 150,000 to your eldest son, he would pay IHT on Pounds 100,000. But if you left it to your three children, there would be no IHT. There would be exemptions or concessions for family businesses. Tessas, Peps: To be replaced eventually by a single savings scheme known as a Registered Savings Account. This would be an account for tax purposes into which cash deposits, shares or money for a pension, would be placed. You would obtain tax relief at your marginal tax rate on the investment, with the account enjoying relief on income and capital gains. There would be income tax to pay once you realised the assets. Pensions: The aim is to increase the basic state pension immediately. For single pensioners, this would mean a rise of Pounds 5 a week and Pounds 8 for married couples. Means testing would end and everyone would receive the pension by right. It would be funded partly through the abolition of the State earnings related pension scheme (Serps), though those with Serps entitlements would receive their Serps pension. The retirement age would be 65 years for men and women.</p>

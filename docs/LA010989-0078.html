			<p><P> January 9, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> India will seek extradition of former Union Carbide Corp. Chairman Warren  Anderson in the Bhopal gas case, a government prosecutor said. U.S. Prasad told  a Bhopal court that arrest warrants issued in November for Anderson and two  other Carbide officials had not been served because of U.S. and Hong Kong legal  restrictions. The U.S. Justice Department said an arrest warrant that specified  automatic $1,000 bail for Anderson was not covered by U.S. laws on  international judicial assistance. A warrant could not be served on Union  Carbide Asst. Secretary John Macdonald or on Peter Wintle, a senior official of  Union Carbide Eastern, for the same reason, Prasad said. All three have been  charged in a criminal suit over the 1984 disaster, in which more than 3,000  people died. Meanwhile, the Indian judge who awarded $270 million in interim  compensation to the victims of the Bhopal gas disaster was formally replaced.  After an October High Court judgment upholding the contention of Union Carbide  Corp. that Judge M. W. Deo had shown bias in making the interim award, the case  was handed over to Judge Shamboo Singh.  </P></p>

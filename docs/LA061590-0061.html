			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HEALTH SECRETARY TAKES AIM AT OLDER SMOKERS;  </P> <P> TOBACCO: IT IS 'NEVER TOO LATE TO STOP' AND REAP BENEFITS OF DOING SO, SULLIVAN  SAYS. IT IS THE LATEST PHASE OF HIS ANTI-CIGARETTE CAMPAIGN.  </P> <P> Health and Human Services Secretary Louis W. Sullivan Thursday took his  anti-smoking crusade on the road, appealing to older Americans, many of whom  have been puffing on cigarettes for decades.  </P> <P> It is "never too late to stop," he said.  </P> <P> Sullivan said that the federal government will start a special public service  campaign in the fall, complete with mass mailings to doctors, television  commercials and celebrity endorsements, to help Americans over the age of 50  "quit that horrible habit."  </P> <P> "Your body can repair much of the damage smoking has done," Sullivan told  delegates to the biennial convention of the American Assn. of Retired Persons.  </P> <P> The 32-million-member AARP will join Sullivan's department and another Cabinet  agency, the Department of Veterans Affairs, in the drive.  </P> <P> With budget stringency preventing development of major new spending programs,  Sullivan has adopted the smoking issue as a high-profile campaign for the huge  federal department he heads.  </P> <P> "You may know that I have helped our community groups oppose tobacco company  plans to market new cigarettes to blacks as well as young white females as well  as existing brands to sports fans and to minors," Sullivan told the delegates.  "Now, it is your turn."  </P> <P> R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. abandoned a major investment in a proposed brand,  Uptown, aimed at black consumers, after Sullivan assailed the company in  January. A day after his speech, in which Sullivan accused the company of  "slick and sinister" efforts to promote "the culture of cancer," Reynolds  dropped its plan to test market the new cigarette in Philadelphia.  </P> <P> Uptown was a mentholated cigarette, aimed at black smokers. About 75% of black  smokers use mentholated brands, compared with only 23% of white smokers.  </P> <P> Sullivan also chastised Reynolds after it was disclosed that the company was  considering marketing plans for a brand to be called Dakota, aimed at  uneducated young white women between the ages of 18 and 24. Sullivan has  mounted a continuous broadside of criticism against the tobacco industry,  including a charge that sports events are taking "blood money" by allowing  sponsorship by cigarette producers.  </P> <P> Sullivan said that more than 13 million people 50 and older smoke, but  two-thirds of them say they want to quit.  </P> <P> "Some older Americans who smoked for decades may think that the damage smoking  does to their bodies cannot be reversed," he said. "I am here to tell you that  such thinking is wrong -- dead wrong. It is never too late to stop."  </P> <P> Sullivan said that even those who have smoked for nearly 50 years can add to  their longevity by quitting. "Your body can repair much of the damage smoking  has done if you stop."  </P> <P> The functions of the heart and the blood circulation begin to improve within  months after a person stops using cigarettes, the secretary said. A year after  a smoker quits, "the extra risk of dying from a heart attack caused by smoking  is gone," he said.  </P> <P> Sullivan told the delegates that "smokers who have diseases like emphysema and  bronchitis also have hope if they stop smoking, because those conditions will  stabilize and get no worse -- once a smoker stops."  </P> <P> Despite the massive wave of publicity since the 1964 surgeon general's report  linking lung cancer and smoking, millions of people are still unaware of the  threat, Sullivan told a news conference after his convention speech.  </P> <P> About 30% of low-income Americans either do not know or do not believe that  smoking endangers their health, he said. More than 400,000 people a year die  from diseases linked to smoking, he said.  </P> <P> The campaign will make a special effort to reach doctors through mailings,  contacts with professional societies and communications to hospital staffs. The  drive will be started in late September, linked to a special report by the  surgeon general on the benefits of quitting smoking.  </P> <P> Sullivan told the AARP delegates, whose membership age ranges from 50 to the  90s, that "older smokers who stop will sleep better and breathe better. They  will walk farther without running out of breath."  </P> <P> Sullivan said also that his department will step up its efforts to detect and  punish abuse of older Americans. New regulations for nursing homes receiving  federal funds will become effective Oct. 1. "We will require stronger reporting  investigations, resolution and follow-up of abuse incidents in nursing homes  that want to continue as Medicare or Medicaid providers," Sullivan said.  </P> <P> A recent report by the House Committee on Aging indicated that there has been a  substantial increase in physical abuse, violence and mistreatment against older  Americans.  </P> <P> "We want the states to report abuse convictions for possible sanctions" against  nursing homes, Sullivan told the delegates.  </P> <P> The government can levy fines against nursing homes in which abuse takes place  or bar the institutions from participating in federally financed programs.  </P> <P> "To abuse an elderly person, whether at home or in a nursing home, is an  inhuman act," Sullivan said. "It is a crime pure and simple."  </P> <P> </P> <P> BACKGROUND  </P> <P> Emboldened by passage of a smoking ban on virtually all domestic airline  flights, tobacco foes in Congress are targeting cigarette marketing practices.  Congress last acted on cigarette advertising in 1984, when it adopted the  current series of rotating label warnings. New proposals would bar the use of  alluring models and other imagery in cigarette ads and create a federally  funded education and media campaign to warn of smoking's dangers.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. ZOO CHIEF ABRUPTLY QUITS DURING PROBE  </P> <P> Los Angeles Zoo Director Warren D. Thomas abruptly resigned Friday, his 16-year  tenure ending amid allegations of chronic deficiencies and fiscal improprieties  at the Griffith Park facility.  </P> <P> Announcement of the resignation came just hours before City Controller Rick  Tuttle released an audit that concluded that Thomas had violated several  provisions of the City Charter in his operation of a special fund into which he  deposited $78,003 in city money without the knowledge of his superiors.  </P> <P> Thomas, 59, will leave his $83,000-a-year post in January, and receive no  special benefits, Mayor Tom Bradley said at a news conference. Bradley said the  early retirement was voluntary. Thomas was not available for comment.  </P> <P> Thomas has been credited with spearheading efforts that have brought the Los  Angeles Zoo a large and varied collection of exotic and endangered wildlife,  but management problems have plagued his administration in recent years.  </P> <P> For the last month, the zoo director has been under investigation by the  Department of Recreation and Parks, which oversees the facility, because of  alleged violations of the federal Animal Welfare Act that investigators said  went uncorrected for years.  </P> <P> City officials also have been examining the special account, called the Zoo  Emergency Fund, which Thomas created in 1987 and which he alone controlled.  </P> <P> The money in the account originated as donations and as fees from film studios,  television networks and other businesses that used the zoo for filming and  promotions. The money should have been deposited with the city, the audit  concluded. Instead, Thomas "diverted" it to an account he had established with  the Greater Los Angeles Zoo Assn., a private, nonprofit organization that helps  run the zoo, according to the audit.  </P> <P> Thomas apparently used some of the money to purchase equipment for the zoo, but  auditors could find no documentation for expenditures totaling $2,344. The  audit also requested that Thomas return $1,878 in unspent travel advance money  that he had not replaced in the account.  </P> <P> Bradley and Recreation and Parks Department officials were circumspect about  the controversies, declining to comment on Thomas' performance or answer  questions about the fund.  </P> <P> "As far as we're concerned, Dr. Thomas is retiring and that closes all the  books on any issues," said Sheldon Jensen, assistant general manager of the  Recreation and Parks Department. It was not clear whether, in light of the new  audit, the department might proceed with reported disciplinary measures against  Thomas.  </P> <P> Thomas decided to step down, Jensen said, because he was "very concerned" about  damage to the zoo's reputation.  </P> <P> "He felt that because of the recent difficulties . . . the Los Angeles Zoo was  attaining a reputation that was denigrating that fine institution, both the  institution and himself," Jensen said.  </P> <P> Jensen credited Thomas with building one of the greatest animal collections in  the United States, if not in the world. Thomas has also worked on projects to  save endangered species and reintroduce captive species to the wild, Jensen  said.  </P> <P> Attendance at the zoo grew dramatically during Thomas' tenure and the facility  has become one of the city's biggest tourist attractions. Last year, 2 million  people visited the zoo and 50,000 individuals and families bought memberships  in the Greater Los Angeles Zoo Assn.  </P> <P> The department will not immediately seek a replacement for Thomas, Jensen said,  but will instead undertake a study aimed at reorganizing the zoo and possibly  turning its operation over to a nonprofit zoological society, similar to the  group that operates the San Diego Zoo and Wild Animal Park.  </P> <P> The resignation was accepted "with a certain amount of concern and sadness,"  Jensen added, "because Warren Thomas, although he has been in the press lately  in a negative sense, has provided a great amount for the zoo."  </P> <P> Thomas' retirement brings to an end a turbulent era for the 26-year-old  institution. A gregarious man who is sometimes described as charismatic, Thomas  also is seen by some current and former associates as arrogant.  </P> <P> In an interview last month, Thomas referred to critics at the Humane Society of  the United States as unqualified "Joe Blows off the street" and said that  federal zoo inspectors did not understand how zoos are run.  </P> <P> City officials had attempted to fire him in 1986, but he sued and was  reinstated the following year by a federal judge, who ruled that his rights had  been violated. At the time, the officials cited a number of problems with the  purchase and sale of animals as well as Thomas' alleged use of racial and  ethnic epithets when speaking about zoo employees. They also alleged that  Thomas took zoo supplies for his personal use.  </P> <P> The recent controversy began last month after The Times reported that the zoo  had been cited repeatedly by the U.S. Department of Agriculture over more than  three years for inadequate food storage, sanitation and drainage problems, pest  and rodent contamination, inadequate housing, run-down animal barns and other  alleged violations.  </P> <P> Nearly a year ago, the USDA sent a certified letter to Thomas demanding an  immediate response to a lengthy list of violations, but did not get a response.  </P> <P> At one point, USDA officials said, they considered closing the facility.  William DeHaven, a USDA official in Sacramento, said Friday that the zoo has  made substantial progress since it reached a low point in July and is no longer  in danger of being shut.  </P> <P> City Councilman Joel Wachs, who has been holding hearings on the zoo, said he  would continue to press for a full explanation of the USDA violations and the  zoo emergency account. "We're not sweeping this under the rug," he said.  </P> <P> John W. Grandy, a vice president of the Humane Society of the United States,  said it was hoped that Thomas' departure would "usher in a new and a better day  for the future of the zoo." He said the city should appoint a blue-ribbon  committee to restore public confidence in the zoo.  </P> <P> Thomas will remain on the job assisting city officials in reorganizing the zoo  structure before he leaves in January, according to Jensen.  </P> <P> Thomas R. Tellefsen, chairman of Greater Los Angeles Zoo Assn.'s executive  committee, voiced concern that Thomas is staying on.  </P> <P> "I think this is going to be a very difficult situation with Warren continuing  in his role during that time," he said.  </P> <P> According to the audit released Friday, the zoo association owes the city the  $78,003 it held in the account for Thomas. However, the audit said, that amount  might be lowered if the Board of Recreation and Parks approves some  expenditures made by Thomas.  </P> <P> Thomas' purchase of equipment with the money violates the City Charter because  such purchases must be made through the city purchasing agent, the audit said.  </P> <P> The audit also criticized Thomas' use of money from the fund to pay for a trip  to Ethiopia this year. In requesting leave time for the trip, Thomas told his  supervisor that the association would pay for it. In fact, however, the  association's board had rejected the trip in 1989, the audit said. In the end,  Thomas took an advance for the trip from the Zoo Emergency Fund.  </P> <P> Tellefsen said zoo association officials will meet with the city on the matter  and would repay any money due.  </P> <P> BUSINESS AS USUAL AT ZOO -- Director's resignation has little impact on  animals, visitors.B1  </P></p>

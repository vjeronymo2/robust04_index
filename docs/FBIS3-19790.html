			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [EC Document No. DOC/IP/94/234: "Agreement on the Fourth </F> Research and Technological Development Framework Program of the  European Union"]    [Text] An extremely important decision for European  research was made on Monday, 21 March. Nine months after being  proposed by the Commission, the Union's 4th Framework Program  for Research and Technological Development [RTD] (1994-99) was  the subject of an agreement between the various institutions.    "It is very satisfying," said Commissioner Antonio Ruberti,  that it was possible to increase the total amount henceforth  allocated to the program from ECU12 billion to ECU12.3 billion.  This ensures the genuine continuity of the Community research  effort. The reserve of ECU0.7 billion, to be unfrozen in 1996,  will make it possible to increase the amount of funds available.    This new framework program will make it possible to put into  action broad guidelines set out in the White Paper on Growth,  Competitiveness, and Employment approved by the heads of state  and government last December. Research and technological  development occupies a strategic position among these guidelines.    The agreement also signalled an important victory at the  institutional level, in that it served as a successful test of  the conciliation procedure -- part of the co-decision procedure  set out in the Maastricht Treaty which closely links the  European Parliament to the decisions made.    The discussion on specific programs intended to ensure the  operational implementation of the 4th framework program can be  initiated immediately. In the coming days and in light of  today's agreement, the Commission will finalize the proposals  for specific programs which it adopted on 9 March. It will  spare no effort to facilitate their approval before the end of  this year.    With a total budget of ECU12.3 billion, plus a reserve of  ECU0.7 billion to be unfrozen in 1996, the 4th framework program  will cover the entire Community research effort for the period  1994-98.    Called upon to contribute significantly toward improving the  scientific and technological foundations of the European  industrial system and improving the quality of life, it will aim  primarily to ensure:     -  improved coordination and rationalized  research efforts in Europe;    -  improved concentration within each  field of research and RTD actions on a lower number of problems  and generic technologies having an impact on multiple  sectors;    -  improved distribution of research results, especially  to small- and medium-sized businesses;    -  increased support by RTD  in implementing the Union's other policies;    -  the development of  links between research and education or training by undertaking,  for the first time, research into the needs of education,  training, and methodologies;    -  lastly, without this list being  exhaustive, to better exploit the possible synergies between  research policy and the policy on economic and social cohesion,  while respecting the specific nature of each.</p>

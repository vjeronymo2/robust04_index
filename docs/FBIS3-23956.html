Approaches to the extension of mortgage credits on the real  estate market are being developed and standard credit products  convenient for consumers are being created. Sergey Ivanovich  Potapov, member of the Council of Russia's Association of  Mortgage Banks, president of the Yunifyucher Firm, told our  correspondent about the state of the mentioned problem and ways  of solving it.    Talking about what is missing for the formation of a  civilized real estate market in Russia, I want to dwell on the  basic factors. First, the absence of a comprehensive mortgage  law. Second, the absence of realistically operating mortgage  mechanisms. Third, the absence of a unified computer service of  registration of real estate facilities and deals with them.  Fourth, the tax policy of the state does not fully take into  account the justification for preferential terms for the  subjects of the real estate market. Fifth, the training of new  people working in this sphere has only begun. Sixth, the  formation of a positive image.    The extension of mortgage credits is one of the elements  necessary for the creation of market relations; of course, not  only in the housing sphere. However, mortgage in its present  sense does not yet exist in Russia. Today we have a very  distinctive "mortgage," all the problems of which are caused by  the crisis state of the economy and by the lack of a  comprehensive legislative base, without which it is impossible  to fully actuate the classic mechanism of extension of mortgage  credits.    At the present stage, subjects of the real estate  market--mortgage banks, insurance companies, available housing,  independent appraisers, and real estate firms--cannot manage  without state assistance. It is not a matter of monetary  subsidies, which can only spur on inflationary processes. We  expect the most rapid coordination of the "rules of the game" on  the real estate market from the state.    At the same time, the Association of Mortgage Banks  established in August of last year is the leading active  lobbyist in the good sense of this word, which promotes the  fermentation of the process of adoption of a comprehensive  mortgage law. This law must take into account without fail the  mortgage of housing, of nonresidential premises, of land, and so  forth. It must expand the field of activity not only for banks,  but also for the system of real estate appraisal and mortgage  insurance, as well as for investment-construction companies.    In our country there is tremendous interest in mortgages.  The  number of mortgage banks is growing and their affiliates are  being opened in Russian cities. According to the evaluations of  our firm's experts, the extension of mortgage credits in Russia  should attract no less than 50 percent of all the financiers.  However, a great deal will have to be done to reach these goals.    In the real estate community there are two points of view of  the formation of the legislative base in Russia--evolutionary  and revolutionary. The advocates of the first assume that in a  short time it is impossible to do with real estate legislation  what in economically developed countries was perfected for  centuries. Advocates of more radical views have a no less  weighty argument: If we are unable to establish normal mutual  relations on the real estate market, of course, taking the  experience of other countries into consideration, we will  definitely destroy the country's economy.    I think that this year is decisive and it will take place  against the background of the integration of real estate and  financial markets. In this connection the problem of an  efficient utilization of real estate by its owners is of no  small importance. Tens of thousands of real estate facilities  throughout the country have already been privatized. Most of  them, just as they did not see builders last year, so, very  possibly, will not see them in the very near future. At the same  time, the cost of leasing premises is rising steadily, which is  due to the shortage of real estate equipped in accordance with  elementary norms. Only economic levers, which bring about an  efficient use of property, can change this situation. A property  tax at the rate of 1 percent of the value of realistically  appraised real estate is the simplest. The introduction of such  a basic rate is next year's task. Without this the process of  formation of the real estate market cannot be accelerated.    It must be stated that the body of directors of industrial  enterprises, who are forced to attract credit resources and to  interact with credit extending banks, are interested in the  appraisal of a realistic property value. At the same time,  insurance savings of enterprises will make up 5 to 8 percent.    With regard to construction organizations the problem of  searching for finances in order to retain their house building  collectives worries them more than making profits. For example,  they are very interested in shareholding in housing construction  and seek opportunities to attract the population's funds. Most  builders believe that for the time being matters pertaining to  the extension of mortgage credits, basically, are theoretical.  In their opinion, there are very few real plans and practical  achievements here.    For the most part Russian mortgage banks work with juridical  persons. Some of them also tried to work with natural persons.  However, they incurred neither substantial losses nor obtained  profit and, therefore, abandoned such an activity. It must be  admitted that, of course, mortgage banks managed to achieve  something, but this represented only a small part of their  potentials. I repeat: There is a need for a firm comprehensive  legislative mortgage base, which unequivocally interprets the  mortgage of land, of housing, and of nonresidential structures.    What positive sprouts are there? First of all, mortgage  banks  actively seek their market and conduct negotiations with  investors and large organizations, which are ready to subsidize  borrowers interested in mortgage credits. For example, Moscow's  municipal council is ready to cooperate with some banks, which  made a good showing, such as the Joint-Stock Mortgage Bank and  the Standartbank. A draft decree of the municipal council on the  development of the extension of mortgage credits in Moscow has  been prepared and in accordance with it mortgage banks will be  creditors for citizens on waiting lists for free municipal  housing in local bodies of power. The municipal council intends  to subsidize such credits through the commercial sale of  municipal housing. Various big organizations can also play the  same role as the municipal council. After all, all large  monopolist enterprises build housing for their workers with  their own funds. They are forced to do this and incur big  expenses on the construction and operation of buildings.  Therefore, they are interested in mortgage credit subsidy. This  would enable them to relieve themselves of this problem and to  transfer housing to the ownership of their workers. In order to  ensure current expenditures, the bank must act as an ordinary  commercial bank--to issue commercial credits and to actively  operate on the interbank market. Banks began to establish  subsidiary firms for operations on the real estate market and to  ask well-known firms for assistance in the appraisal of  residential and nonresidential premises and their sale if  credits are not returned. For example, our firm has drafted a  package of mutual contractual relations among the bank, the  client, and the real estate firm concerning the appraisal and  sale of an apartment not bought out by the client.    What should be done in order to attain progress in mortgage  development in Russia?    Naturally, with the large number of credit products and  their  modifications it is difficult to get oriented in them.  Therefore, if the opportunity of getting mortgage credits is now  granted to our population, it will be sufficient to make do with  only a small number of versions of credit products. This is  convenient both for the bank and for the investor. It is simpler  to buy up mortgages. If every mortgage is individual, it will  not be possible to sell it wholesale on the secondary market.  Let us turn to the concept of a "securities market." In what  cases does it develop? When such a concept as the grade of a  security appears. Owing to it, stocks and bonds find extensive  application--they are the same, standard. When the moment comes  that the market accepts only a small number of credit products,  it will become very convenient for banks to operate.    The issue of mortgage credits by banks both to citizens and  to juridical persons should become constant practice in bank  operation. At first these will be credits within the framework  of specific programs, where there are already investors and  organizations ready to subsidize these credits. Such examples  already exist. The Standartbank, which has begun such operations  with the Kama Motor Vehicle Plant, can be mentioned. Several  thousands of long-term credits have been issued at a low  interest. This is a large-scale plan, according to which the  issue of about 10,000 credits until 1995-1996 is anticipated. A  great deal will depend on investors, that is, on the resources  that they are prepared to invest in mortgages. Bank plans also  include the extension of credits to private individuals. All  over the world it is believed that for banks these are the least  risky operations owing to the small sums. In the 19th century it  was precisely the private issue of large credits into the same  hands that was the cause of the collapse of the first commercial  banks in Russia. As a rule, large amounts of credits are not  issued to natural persons. However, the risk of nonreturn also  exists. In order to reduce it, very serious prerequisites are  needed. I will try to note the main ones:    1. The availability of reliable data on the borrower's  income, which is necessary for an evaluation of his solvency. An  efficient operation of the tax service is required for this.    2. The establishment of a bank of data on borrowers' credit  histories at the level of cities and regions. If a person has a  bad credit dossier, no bank will grant him credit.    3. Insurance companies must provide another type of  service--insurance of the return of mortgage credits.    4. Firms insuring the purity of the title of ownership,  which  does not yet exist in our country, are needed.    It is very important to have reliable information on the  value of real estate. Our firm--Yunifyucher--plans to  computerize this kind of information all over Russia. We are  mainly interested in the value of enterprises, office premises,  and municipal housing so that our clients--banks and other  financial institutions--may be able to use these data.  Negotiations are now being conducted with several American  firms, which have computer real estate bases both in the United  States and all over the world. At our clients' requests we hope  to receive information through the real estate telecommunication  system operated by us.    There should be a surplus of information on the real estate  market. True, everything depends on the condition of the real  estate and where it is located. There are unfinished projects,  with which nothing can be done--they are ruins. There are  projects not meeting international standards, in which technical  backwardness is inherent even at the planning stage. Foreign  investors more often prefer to dismantle abandoned projects and  to build in their places first-class hotels, profitable houses,  and supermarkets. Unfinished projects must be sold at cut-rate  prices, but economic sanctions must be established for those who  simply stake out a claim in expectation of better times. Russia  has lost too much, transferring money to foundation pits so that  they may disfigure its appearance for a long time. There should  be only economic levers here. But the scope for activity is  wide. Firms working with real estate do not hamper each other.  Specialization has already appeared: some are reconstructing  private houses, some lease out housing, and some sell cottages  with land plots. I will touch upon the characteristics of the  Yunifyucher Firm, which I head. Its name reflects the idea of  combining people's efforts for the creation of a worthy future.  Our philosophy is based on the fact that we are surrounded not  by competitors in the form of real estate firms, but by  colleagues, together with whom we are creating a civilized real  estate market. We are trying to counterpose the systems  approach, "turnkey" work, and a system of guarantees for the  client to amateur brokers.    About 970 firms connected with the buying and selling of  dwellings advertise themselves in Moscow now. Things are going  well for approximately 110 of them. Fifty such firms are former  state structures established with large investments and,  therefore, have strong starting positions. They had access to  information and powerful connections, which at times plays a  decisive role. However, private firms achieved everything by  themselves, beginning from small things. For example,  Yunifyucher had a charter fund of only 1,000 rubles. Like the  legal association BAISO and the SAVVA Firm our firm has gained  recognition only through its own efforts.    In June 1993 we presented the first real estate  telecommunication system. The development of a remote access  system is being completed now. It will enable our subscribers,  sitting in Vladivostok, Yekaterinburg, San Francisco, or a dacha  near Moscow, to communicate with Yunifyucher by telephone, to  access our central computer, and to make any request in an  arbitrary form. For example, there is a need for a prestigious  office in the center of Moscow with an area of 200 square meters  or a separate building in the capital. At present we are ready  to discuss with interested financial institutions and legal  structures the question of the establishment of a joint-stock  company, which will introduce the real estate telecommunication  system into the Russian market.    I will also touch upon the realtors' guild. It unites  professionals and, therefore, the very participation in the  guild gives a certain image to a firm and indirectly attracts  clients to it. The guild raised the question of licensing real  estate activity. When this is carried out, there will be fewer  amateurs and simply incidental people in our business. In the  United States there are brokers, who have received licenses and  who are able to work on their own. The same can also be in our  country. The fact that the guild gives information and  methodological materials to its members is also important. It  widely popularizes mortgage ideas, realizing what important  place in its infrastructure is assigned to realtors.    I think that it is important for people who make decisions  to  pursue their policy in the real estate sphere through serious  firms. After all, the wider the contact with professionals, the  bigger the guarantees that policy in the real estate sphere will  bring success in the realization of the housing program,  development of cities, and an efficient utilization of our  country's land.</p>

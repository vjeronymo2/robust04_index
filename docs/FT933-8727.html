			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Wider EC trade area would mean CAP rethink, study says RECENT EVENTS pointing to further integration of eastern Europe with the European Community have unleashed forces that eventually will lower world farm commodity prices and force a restructuring of the Common Agriculture Policy, according to a study by three US farm economists. The study says the changes would be neutral to the US in net welfare terms, with farm exporters' losses more than matched by gains to consumers through lower food prices. According to the study by Mr James Gleckler, Mr Robert Koopman and Mr Luther Tweeten, full integration into the EC of the European Free Trade Area countries and the eastern European states of Hungary, Poland, the Czech and Slovak Republics, the former Yugoslavia, Romania, Bulgaria and Albania, would lift the cost to the EC budget of the nine main commodities regulated by the CAP to Dollars 4.7bn at the end of the century from Dollars 3.6bn in 1989. At the same time, world prices for course grains would fall by almost 18 per cent, with beef, maize and sugar prices falling by 8-9 per cent. Only pork prices would rise - by about 2 per cent. 'Because many of the eastern regions are impoverished and eligible for special assistance in addition to that for commodities, full integration would greatly expand CAP budget requirements,' the study says. 'The burden of financing CAP for an agriculture sector roughly twice the size of the present EC would fall squarely on the shoulders of the original 12 members. 'The Community, already facing crisis in financing agricultural programmes, could need to restructure the CAP. Lower price supports, production controls, and a shift to direct payments are possible reforms.' European integration would cost US farmers about Dollars 2.2bn a year by the end of the century, with maize and beef producers losing most. But gains from lower food prices would amount to more than Dollars 2.3bn. A farm trade official in London said yesterday that there had been no formal studies in the EC of the likely cost to the CAP of European integration. '(The costs) could be massive, but since this is not going to happen before the end of the century, it depends on so many incalculable assumptions that predictions are meaningless,' he said. In Brussels, an EC farm official said a preliminary study was being carried out at Kiel University in Germany that suggested the cost impact of integration 'would not be as important as these American academics claim'.

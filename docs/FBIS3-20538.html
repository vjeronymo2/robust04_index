			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mao Xiaorui (3029 0879 3843) and Wang Yanyan </F> (3769 3601 3601): "Adjusting the Structure, Empowering, Changing  Habits of Thought, Considering the Overall Situation--Directors  of Some Provincial Agricultural Bureaus Discuss the Problem of  Farmers' Income"]    [Text] Developing township enterprises is the key to  increasing farmers' income    Yu Jingzhong [0151 2417 1813], Director of the Jiangsu  Agricultural Bureau: The average income of farmers in the  Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou areas of Jiangsu is currently over  2,000 yuan, while in northern Jiangsu it is less than 1,000  yuan. The difference is due to township enterprises. Practice  proves that developing township enterprises is the key to  increasing farmers' income.    One argument is that developing township enterprises will  affect agricultural production, but really, this is totally  untrue. My province is the birthplace of township enterprises,  and currently, the gross productive value and export for earning  foreign exchange by township enterprises in the province  occupies 50 percent of the province's total productive value and  export for earning foreign exchange respectively. It really is  like "half of the country." Meanwhile, township enterprises in  Jiangsu Province have created the means by which industry can  help agriculture. This is especially the case in southern  Jiangsu where, annually and per capita, every township employee  contributes 120 yuan to the agriculture development fund, 60  percent of agricultural expenditures comes from township  enterprises, and agriculture and industry in southern Jiangsu  have entered a "period of mutual assistance." Agricultural  products continue to increase. Southern Jiangsu's experience  proves that there is "no agricultural stability without  industry."    At present, the biggest problem in Jiangsu is how to improve  farmers' income in the northern part of the province. Our  general thinking is to do our utmost to go the way of merging  trade, industry, and agriculture in order to develop agriculture  as we link up the northern and southern parts to develop  township enterprises, develop multiple operations which will  promote sideline industries, supplying their primary  accumulation to township enterprises in northern Jiangsu. The  vegetable processing company run by the Agriculture Bureau in  Lian Yun Gang municipality selected the "company plus farming  families" way. It created over $7 million in 1993 from exports,  with a gross profit of 15 million yuan. Farmers' income  increased dramatically.    In 1993, township enterprises in Jiangsu absorbed as many as  10 million people from the surplus labor force.  <H3>  We must correctly handle the contradiction between making  farmers prosperous and making contributions to the state. </H3>   Deng Daokun [6772 6670 0981], Director of the  Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Bureau of Hubei: If  farmers are not prosperous -- then they will themselves be  lagging in their contributions to agriculture, and stable  development of agriculture will be impossible; it will also make  it hard to work the rural market, which will affect the working  of the entire domestic economy; meanwhile, it will cause a lot  of political problems. So, the problem of increasing farmers'  income is not only an economic problem but also a political  problem. Due to the relatively low profitability of agriculture,  farmers now have little enthusiasm for planting grains. The key  to resolving this problem is to balance the contradiction  between making farmers prosperous and making contributions to  the state. I think we must do the following several things well  right now in order to resolve this contradiction:    1) Under the prerequisite of complying with value laws,  implement efficient market adjustment for agricultural products.    2) To guarantee efficient supply and accomplish  macroadjustment and control, we must set up a storage system for  major agricultural products, and carry out adjustment by means  of such economic means as benefits, taxes, and prices, along  with relevant polices. This will guarantee the current profits  of producers of major and big agricultural products, and make  their income no lower than that of others engaged in  nonagricultural industries.    3) As major agriculture producing areas still require  stronger adjustment of their industrial structure, develop "one  excellent and two high" agriculture, to increase the incomes of  farmers in major producing areas.    4) Establish a protective agriculture risk fund system, to  protect major and big agricultural products and by-products from  substantial price fluctuations.    5) Vigorously develop secondary and tertiary industry,  transfer the surplus labor force, accomplish intensive farming  in agriculture, and operate on a scale which will improve  current labor productivity. In addition, we must perfect the  market system.    If we do not take efficient steps to increase the income of  grain planting farmers, it will be hard to continue agricultural  production.  <H3>  The key point in increasing farmers' income is to establish  extensive agriculture concepts. </H3>   Zhao Xiaodao [6392 1420 6670], Director of the  Agriculture Bureau of Zhejiang: the key to growth is to  adjust and perfect the agricultural structure. We must  establish extensive agricultural concepts, adjust the structure  and develop "one excellent two high" agriculture, including  development of secondary and tertiary industry. It won't work if  grain production just has grain production in mind; we must look  at agriculture via the market economy concept.    The per capita annual income of Zhejiang farmers is 1,600  yuan, but there are still some farmers making between 400 and  500 yuan, including over 2 million farmers who still have  trouble obtaining sufficient food and clothing. Due to the  development of secondary and tertiary industry, 15 percent of  farmers have an income of over 3,000 yuan. So the key to  increasing farmers income is to develop secondary and tertiary  industry.    Based on the current situation, what is important is to  resolve the problem of low comparative profits from grains,  cotton, and vegetable oil, while developing secondary and  tertiary industry. Chiefly, the price reforms for agricultural  products and by-products must support each other; on the one  hand, we should put price subsidies on productive links, clarify  property rights, stabilize contracted rights, make operational  rights more flexible to promote operation of scale, and change  the situation of inefficient agricultural operation of scale.  Taking the road of capital construction has prompt efficiency  for backward mountainous areas.    In addition, when formulating concrete measures, we must  resolve the problem of poor implementation.  <H5>  The biggest national concern is to increase farmers' income. </H5>   Wang Shousen [3769 1108 2773], Director of the  Agriculture Bureau of Shaanxi: In the last year, the per capita  income of farmers in Shanxi was 559 yuan, which was 225 yuan  less than the national per capita farmers' income. This year,  the gap is even greater, increasing to 250 yuan. There are many  reasons for this situation, but the major problem is backward  thoughts and concepts, not having jumped out of the narrow  circle of self-sufficiency to have sufficient food and clothing.  This then leads to slow adjustment of industrial structure,  undeveloped township enterprises, a low level of  industrialization for agricultural products, and a loss of  value-adding.    The important problem now is to study why farmers' income is  not high, and why their enthusiasm and investment in agriculture  has declined. Based on current phenomena, it is due chiefly to  the rising prices of productive materials. The policy of rising  grains and cotton was just issued last year. When wheat has just  been planted, there are eight months to the harvest, and there  is a tendency for the prices of productive materials to rise.  Therefore, there must be a protective system for organizing  production, for if there is any trouble, who can farmers depend  on? Who will take care of farmers who suffer disaster? If we  free the prices of productive materials, to what degree can it  go? What is unreasonable now is that whatever farmers investing  is linked with markets, but whatever farmers sell is linked with  the planned economy. If let go, the income of grain planting  farmers will go lower and lower. So we have to consider  carefully the transfer of profits, and consider the farmers'  ability to assume burdens. Overall, the state hasn't figured  out a way to develop agricultural products according to the laws  of a market economy.    I believe that the state cannot rely on raising the prices  of  agricultural products through financial subsidy as the way of  increasing farmers' income, and not consider other ways. If  farmers were subsidized through a per capita annual fiscal  increase, they would only get 30 yuan each. To increase farmers'  income we must depend on going out beyond agriculture, extending  to nonagricultural industry, doing fine and deep processing to  resolve the problem of employing the surplus labor force. In  other words, develop township enterprises. Also, the government  has to provide leadership and support in the detailed work of  increasing farmers' incomes. In 1992, the gross output of apples  in Shaanxi was 840,000 tons, which created sales difficulties.  In 1993, the gross output was 1.12 million tons, but the  government took energetic measures, taking advantage of Xian's  fame, holding apple trade talks, negotiating transportation  problems on behalf of the provincial party committee....  Through the efforts of leaders and masses, there have been no  apple sales difficulties this year. Farmers say that the  provincial party committee has done a good thing for them. This  issue taught us that we can't just simply push farmers to the  markets, we have to help them create markets. The government has  an undeniable responsibility in this. At the same time, it also  instructed us what agricultural departments should do under the  market economy.    We must also strengthen and accelerate establishment and  perfection of the market operation system. Overall, the biggest  national concerning of China is to increase farmers' income, and  this is our principal mission at present.

			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Letter: Traps that inhibit growth of grant-maintained schools Sir, You are to be congratulated on avoiding many of the elephant-traps into which some of your colleagues have fallen when considering the impact of grant-maintained schools (Leading article: 'A strategy for UK education', May 6). But one or two have caught you. The Department of Education and Science has rejected nearly half the applications by schools threatened with closure, so GM status has not totally inhibited closure - except perhaps where local education authorities have failed to bring proposals forward. The DES has provided a 'decentralised administration to manage' GM schools - in each of the schools themselves - and if the DES's 'mechanism of control' is weak it is intentionally so. First, schools cannot make strides if they do not take risks (and those risks may on occasion be ill-judged); second, most schools flourish when politicians leave them alone, not when (however good their intentions) they have the capacity for infinite intervention. (And anyway, the education offered by Stratford School has emphatically not been thrown into turmoil). As for funding, although the DES may in due course need to establish an agency - like the Benefits Agency - to fund the growing GM sector, regional bodies 'representing the community' are not justified. An effective market offers choice not only to a local majority of consumers, but also, and more effectively than 'representative' structures, to minorities. Finally, a stable institutional framework is exactly what is not required for education to flourish. Institutions must be capable of adapting to the demands of parents, pupils and the wider community, and mechanisms and policies should be tailored to help them to adapt. Unencumbered, grant-maintained schools are both vital and flexible. Andrew Turner, director, Choice in Education, 36 Great Smith Street, London SW1P 3BU</p>

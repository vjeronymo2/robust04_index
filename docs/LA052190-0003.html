			<p><P> May 21, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDICIAL CHOICES FOR VARIOUS COURT POSTS  </P> <P> Only one Superior Court seat, Office No. 8, is being contested in Los Angeles  County, and we strongly urge that the incumbent, Judge Lourdes G. Baird, be  reelected.  </P> <P> Judge Baird, a former federal prosecutor with wide experience, is one of the  most outstanding jurists currently sitting on the Superior Court bench. That is  one reason, among many in her distinguished career, that led President Bush to  submit her name for Senate confirmation as the new United States attorney for  Los Angeles. Judge Baird's nomination now is pending before the Judiciary  Committee. Until it acts and the full Senate votes, which may take some time,  the people of Los Angeles County will want to retain the services of a jurist  of proven excellence.  </P> <P> For three of the four contested Municipal Court seats, the decision is equally  clear. In Office No. 13 of the Los Angeles Municipal Court, for example, the  incumbent, Judge Emily A. Stevens, is an experienced member of the bar whose  intelligence, fairness and hard work on the bench have won her the respect not  only of her judicial colleagues, but also of the prosecuting and defense  attorneys who appear before her. For those reasons, she has been rated well  qualified by the Los Angeles County Bar Assn. Her opponent has been rated  unqualified. We urge that Judge Stevens be reelected.  </P> <P> Similarly, in the Antelope Valley Municipal Court Judicial District No. 1, the  incumbent, Judge Richard E. Spann, is an experienced, highly respected jurist  with close ties to the community. He has been rated well- qualified by the bar  association, while his opponent has been deemed unqualified. Judge Spann should  be elected to another term.  </P> <P> In the race for the open Downey Judicial District seat, the only candidate  rated well-qualified by the bar association's rigorous evaluation system is  Marvin Licker. That, coupled with the experience he has gained as a court  commissioner, leads us to recommend Licker's election to the seat.  </P> <P> Four candidates rated well-qualified by the association are seeking the open  Santa Monica Municipal Court Office No. 3. Two of them, labor lawyer David B.  Finkel, a member of the Santa Monica City Council, and Municipal Court  Commissioner Norman Perry Tarle, are particularly worthy. Both have outstanding  records of public service and tough-minded but compassionate notions of how  judges of the Municipal Court ought to discharge their duties.  </P> <P> However, Tarle's five years of applicable, hands-on experience as a court  commissioner gives him a slight edge in what is, on the merits, a very close  race. For that reason, we recommend that Commissioner Norman Perry Tarle be  elected to Office No. 3.  </P></p>

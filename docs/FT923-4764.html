			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Mixed fortunes for Courtaulds Textiles COURTAULDS Textiles had mixed fortunes in the first half of the year. Among the hardest hit areas were US lace sales, where customers had over-ordered last year. 'We turned the machines off which was very costly but the right thing to do,' said Mr Martin Taylor, chief executive. Sales of soft furnishings and towels in the UK were depressed by the slack housing market. Margins held up as a result of tight cost control. Margins also improved in the company's own-label clothes, where operating profits were higher despite a 16 per cent fall in sales to Pounds 102.2m. Retail competition cut margins in branded clothing and left operating profits at Pounds 1.7m (Pounds 2.8m) Lingerie label Gossard maintained profits. COMMENT There are limits to what a good management can do in the face of such grim market conditions as those which face Courtaulds Textiles. The company has worked hard to cut costs and debt, and shareholders should be pleased to see their dividend rise while interest payments to banks fall yet again. Nevertheless, the profits outlook is a little worse now than a few months ago. The company should make Pounds 44m for the full year and show earnings of 33p a share. That puts the shares on 11.5 times earnings, a touch below the rest of the sector, which will look increasingly cheap if the dollar recovers.</p>

			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Mercosur pact on customs The four member countries of South America's Mercosur trade pact have agreed on a compromise formula allowing the creation of a customs union on January 1 1995. The presidents of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay signed on Friday at a summit in Buenos Aires documents establishing a common external tariff structure that will come into effect next January. The four overcame a long-standing dispute between Argentina and Brazil over common tariffs by agreeing to tariffs of 0-20 per cent for nearly all their imports. They also compromised over protection for the high-tech goods that comprise 15 per cent of their trade. Brazil wants to protect its struggling telecommunications, computer and capital goods industries. Disagreement over tariffs, plus Brazil's inability to stabilise its economy and Argentina's informal request to join the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) last year, threatened to disrupt establishment of Mercosur. However, Argentina and Brazil agreed that each country would apply separate tariffs for high-technology goods until next decade, when all four countries would introduce a common tariff of 14-16 per cent.</p>

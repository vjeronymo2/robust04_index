According to statistics, some 80 percent of the province's  12,778 foreign-funded firms are making profits, 15 percent  maintain a balance and the other three percent to five percent  are losing money.    The promising investment environment and profitable  production spur foreign business people to expand their projects.    It is estimated that the increased amount of foreign  investment so far this year is nearly 2 billion yuan.    Foreign-funded enterprises have become a major force in  exports from the province.    Last year, foreign-funded companies achieved an export value  of 3.004 billion dollars, constituting 52.9 percent of the total  for Fujian.    Their exports include garments, shoes, electronic and  chemical products and building materials. The markets are in  Europe, the United States and Japan.    The average foreign investment in each foreign-funded  project  was 2.41 million U.S. dollars last year, much higher than the  average for the country as a whole.    Overseas funds are increasing in infrastructure, the power  industry and service sector.    A number of foreign-funded electric power projects have been  approved by the province. The Meizhou Bay power plant is a  solely foreign funded project. Its initial investment topped  350 million U.S. dollars.    Foreign-funded firms have also started to conduct management  based on Chinese monetary and taxation policies.    In addition, many of them have set up retirement insurance  schemes for their employees.</p>

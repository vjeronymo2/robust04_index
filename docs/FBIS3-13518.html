			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "In Quest of a New Role"] </F>   [Text] It is over 15 months since a virtual coup was  staged and Russian puppets took over in the Muslim-inhabited  Republic of Tajikistan. For months the Persian-speaking Tajik  people witnessed the catastrophic crimes perpetrated by the  Russian forces and antipopular government of Uzbekistan [as  published] in the country.    In this period, tens of thousands of Muslim men, women,  youth, and children, have been dragged into blood and dust and  the call to prayer has been snuffed out in most parts of the  country. Theological schools have been closed down and most of  the intelligentsia, writers, clerics, and university staff  members have been martyred or arrested. Hundreds of thousands  of people have been rendered homeless in the debilitating winter  and are wandering in mountains and wildernesses. Most of the  people are being shot with a hail of bullets before the eyes of  their families merely for belonging to a certain tribe or  district and the cities of Tajikistan have become the tramping  ground for murderers and ruffians who enjoy Russian support.    Even though the Western mass media has boycotted all news of  events in Tajikistan in a coordinated measure, some reports  squeeze through the cracks and tell of the depth of savagery and  brutality of the former communists and supporters of Russia.  There is no doubt that the Russian Government has had the main  role in the events in Tajikistan in the past year.    The people of Tajikistan will not forget Russia's  obstructionism in preventing fuel and foodstuffs from reaching  Dushanbe during the brief period that a popular government was  in power in Tajikistan. The Tajiks are well aware that the  puppet regime -- which right from the outset has brought nothing  for the people but poverty, hunger, misfortune, killing, and  plunder -- cannot survive even for a day without Russian support.    Following the UN's announcement of the 16 March date for  talks between the leaders of national Islamic groups of  Tajikistan with the ruling regime and the Russian Government,  Russia is seeking to wrest the initiative and to direct the  talks toward its own longterm interests.    It is being said that the Russian first deputy foreign  minister has been in Iran for a few days and has had talks with  the leaders of some Islamic national Tajik groups. Reports of  these meetings were carried in some foreign media and in some  Moscow publications. However, the officials of our Foreign  Ministry have apparently not deemed it necessary to disseminate  the news of these talks inside Iran as well! The Russian first  deputy foreign minister has made immense efforts to convince the  Tajik leaders to accept Moscow as the venue for the talks but  they seem to have expressed a preference for Tehran or Islamabad.    The Russians, who have played the main part in creating the  present situation in Tajikistan, are now seeking to assume a new  role of a mediator between the Tajik Government and opposition  while retaining the role of big brother. The latest reports  indicate that the Tajik group leaders have agreed that the first  round of talks should begin on 16 March in Moscow.    Our Tajik brothers and sisters should maintain as strong a  stance in the talks as they displayed during their rightful  struggle and should not succumb to the blackmail and whipping up  of any kind of atmosphere. Undoubtedly, the Islamic Republic of  Iran will not forget the oppressed Muslims of Tajikistan in  these difficult days and will -- as has been stressed repeatedly  by the leader of the Revolution, His Eminence Ayatollah  Khamene'i -- support their just aspirations to attain freedom  and independence.</p>

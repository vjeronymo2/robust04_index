			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Willy Wo-lap Lam] </F>   [Excerpt] Prime Minister Li Peng is touring Guangdong to  personally ensure that recentralisation policies announced by  Beijing in the past fortnight will be enforced in the  localities. However, Mr Li, who suffered a heart attack last  year and has lost the bulk of his economic decision-making  powers to Executive Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji, is also anxious to  secure regional support to consolidate his power base. Sources  in Guangdong said the premier, who flew into Guangzhou last  week, had pledged his support for the radical reforms being  carried out in the future-oriented province.    The Chinese-run Hong Kong daily, WEN WEI PO, reported  yesterday that Mr Li, who usually comes to Guangdong at least  once a year, had already visited the Pearl River estuary boom  towns of Zhongshan and Foshan. The paper said the premier was  anxious to get a personal understanding of supplies in the  market and the people's living conditions before the Lunar New  Year.    Sources in Guangdong said, however, that Mr Li's principal  objective was to ensure the application of decisions to boost  Beijing's macro-level control over the economy, which were made  at a Politburo meeting last month. A large part of the  recentralisation measures is aimed at reducing the authority of  localities in making investments in capital construction and in  fixing their own tax rates. Chinese papers yesterday quoted the  Finance Minister, Liu Zhongli, as saying that local governments  had no right to set their own value-added tax rates on property.    It is understood that Guangdong, which has among all  provinces marketed the largest number of commercial and  residential buildings in Hong Kong and overseas, is anxious to  grant tax remissions to favoured customers. "Li Peng has hit  home the point that in spite of its ability to secure  development funds from non-governmental sources, Guangdong must  heed central edicts on the scale of investment so as not to  exacerbate inflation," a source said. "Moreover, the premier is  worried about a new spate of speculation in real estate and  stocks, as well as the opening up of development zones for which  investments have not been secured."

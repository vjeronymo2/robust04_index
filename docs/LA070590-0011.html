			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BACK TO BASICS: SLICING A CHIFFONADE OF GREENS OR HERBS  </P> <P> Chiffonade is an elaborate name for a simple food-preparation technique. The  term refers to leafy greens and herbs cut into thin ribbons.  </P> <P> To prepare a chiffonade of spinach, wash the leaves well, trimming away the  stems and any discolored areas. Dry, then stack five or six leaves (Step 1),  placing the larger leaves on the bottom.  </P> <P> Beginning at one side, roll the leaves into a tight cylinder (Step 2). Hold the  cylinder with one hand and slice it into fine strips (Step 3). When unrolled,  the leaves are thin ribbons (Step 4).  </P> <P> Basil, sorrel, endive, lettuce and cabbage leaves are also excellent choices  for preparing a chiffonade. The ribbons may serve as garnishes or beds for  other foods. They may also be sauteed with butter, moistened with stock, milk  or cream and used as a garnish for soup.  </P> <P>  Suggestions for column topics may be sent to Back to Basics, Food Section, The  Times, Times Mirror Square, Los Angeles 90053.  </P> <P> </P></p>

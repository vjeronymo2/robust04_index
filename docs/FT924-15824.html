			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / PSA arm taken over by Tarmac: Government pays buyer Pounds 50m TARMAC, Britain's biggest construction and building materials group, yesterday took over the Property Services Agency's projects division. The move puts under threat the jobs of 900 former government employees. The government has paid the company almost Pounds 50m to take over responsibility for the division, one of the country's biggest construction organisations, employing 1,800 people. Mr John Redwood, environment minister, said: 'It was the best deal we could have got. It would have cost the taxpayer a lot more if we had been forced to shut down the division rather than disposing of it to Tarmac.' For many years the projects division has designed and managed the construction of buildings for government and other public-sector bodies. Tarmac said it could guarantee work for only 925 people. The Environment Department said it was too early to say how many people would be left without work. Some might be employed on a temporary basis with Tarmac. Others might be transferred elsewhere in the public sector or opt for voluntary redundancy. Mr Redwood said the cash payment to Tarmac recognised that money needed to be invested in the business if it was to continue. In addition to the Pounds 49.75m payment, the government had offered to provide financial assistance to help with redundancy payments if they rose above a certain level. He said Tarmac's offer was chosen from a final shortlist of six. About 60 companies, including some international groups, originally expressed interest in acquiring the division. attracted by the prospect of taking advantage of its public-sector contacts. The division, which last year had a turnover of Pounds 190m has wide experience of building offices, courts, prisons, laboratories, civil and military airports. Its experience of public-sector building requirements and strong links with government departments has meant that it has continued to win a large share of work even though most public-sector construction contracts are now subject to competitive tender. Control of the Property Services Agency is being switched to the private sector in two stages, and the PSA's building management operations will be offered for sale later this year. NEW DESIGN orders for construction work have fallen and there is little chance of improvement next year, the Royal Institute of British Architects said in its quarterly report yesterday. The value of new commissions fell 14 per cent to Pounds 1.12bn in the second quarter of this year. Wales and Scotland were worst affected, with 36 per cent falls in orders. The south-west was the only area to record a rise in new commissions, up 14 per cent. The institute said: 'The optimism generated by the election has disappeared. Despondency is the order of the day throughout the industry. Our view is that 1993 will be another year of depressed workloads for the profession.' Just 18 per cent of practices expect a rise in work over the next six months, compared with 28 per cent last quarter. A further 126 staff are to be made redundant at the Construction Industry Training Board, which blamed reduced income due to the recession.</p>

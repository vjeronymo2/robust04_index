			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Heat ray control paint for space use developed by  Nippon Paint Co., Ltd. to control the temperatures of the  surface and interior of satellites has been certified for the  first time by the National Aerospace Laboratory as the official  paint for common parts used in space. Two types of products are  available for antennas and sensors. They are scheduled to be  used for the largest domestically produced satellite, the  ``ADEOS,'' scheduled for launch in 1996. If production costs are  reduced, many predict that it can be used for automobiles and  the interior of buildings to control temperature increases.    Nippon Paint has developed two types of heat ray control  paint for antennas by using basic paint material containing  silicon resin, the ``NOVA 500 ASTRO WHITE'' (registered name),  and for equipment by using basic paint material containing  urethane resin, the ``NOVA 500 ASTRO BLACK'' (registered name).    The company states they have independently developed a  special white pigment for antennas to control solar energy  absorption. By adding this pigment to the paint they have  achieved a solar energy absorption rate of about 0.26, and a  solar energy vertical radiation rate of about 0.88 for the  antenna which controlled the surface temperature to about  120&deg;C; the unpainted antenna would have reached nearly  500&deg;C. Also the new paint is high in elasticity, and  therefore will not crack even when exposed to big differences in  temperature. Addition of inorganic special ultraviolet absorbant  also increases weatherability.    On the other hand, paint for use on equipment such as  sensors, receivers, and recorders mounted on satellites has the  function of irradiating outward the heat rays emitted by  equipment on board. Details of the technology have not been  disclosed, but the key to their success lies in the new  synthesis of a special elastic urethane resin which is excellent  at heat radiation. Approximately 0.89 of the vertical radiation  rate for solar energy was achieved.    The company solved the problem of paint gasification by  developing a technology to remove that portion of the resin with  low molecular weight. If not so treated, elements of the paint  film are gasified and given off during formation under a vacuum.</p>

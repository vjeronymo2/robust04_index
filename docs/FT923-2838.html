			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Document leak highlights fragility of Ulster talks AN IRISH government paper on Northern Ireland has been leaked, raising the stakes at the round-table talks on the province's future which resume at Stormont today. The paper has angered the Democratic Unionist party. The paper confirms the Irish government's willingness to negotiate its territorial claim to Northern Ireland, but says important concessions will be required from Ulster's unionists in return. Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the DUP, said yesterday: 'It is clear the message the Irish government wants to give is that it is digging in its heels.' He and the Reverend Ian Paisley, the party leader, walked out of the talks - which involve the British and Irish Governments and the four Ulster constitutional political parties - last week, saying that unless the Irish Republic 'realistically addresses' its territorial claim to Northern Ireland, they will not participate further. Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist party leader, has warned that his delegates will also withdraw from the talks in the coming weeks if there is no indication of progress on this issue. Both parties want the Irish government to commit itself to a referendum to amend Articles Two and Three of the Republic's constitution. Mr Robinson said yesterday: 'We cannot have any relationship with the Irish Republic while they have a territorial claim over Northern Ireland.' The Dublin-based Irish Times published extracts from an Irish government position paper submitted to the talks on August 28. One extract says the Irish government 'does not rule out constitutional change resulting from the present negotiations' but adds that the Irish electorate 'will be particularly sensitive to the impact of any proposed amendment on the position of the nationalist minority in Northern Ireland'. It describes the minority as 'victims' of the Government of Ireland Act, which partitioned Ireland in 1920. The extract goes on to say: 'If as certain delegations have urged, proposals for constitutional change emerging from the negotiations were to include changes to the Irish constitution, the strength and quality of the link between both parts of Ireland would be one of the important factors in shaping the judgment of the electorate in this regard. 'Those who urge that the division introduced by the act should be endorsed by the nationalist community have a corresponding duty to say how the evident flaws of the original, purportedly temporary, provisions would be addressed' The Irish foreign ministry said: 'The talks are confidential and it is regrettable there should be continued leaks. It makes things more difficult for (participants) to reveal their positions if they think it is going to be published in the papers the next day.' ARTICLES TWO AND THREE OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND Article 2 The national territory consists of the whole island of Ireland, its islands and the territorial seas. Article 3 Pending the re-integration of the national territory, and without prejudice to the right of the parliament and the government established by this constitution to exercise jurisdiction over the whole of that territory, the laws enacted by that parliament shall have the like are and extent of application as the laws of Saorstat Eireann 'the Irish Free State) and the like extra-territorial effect.</p>

			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Survey of Housing Associations (8): Private firms may get public cash - Grants Government is considering offering grants direct to private housebuilders to build and operate social housing developments similar to those run by housing associations, writes ANDREW TAYLOR. This would satisfy the government's desire to provide greater competition for the supply of social housing as well as, possibly, encouraging greater private sector investment in rented housing. The grant would be similar to the housing association grant (HAG) administered by the Housing Corporation. Private sector developers, however, may be reluctant to become landlords of social housing developments, according to Mr Alan Cherry, chairman of Countryside Properties and chairman of the social housing committee of the House Builders Federation. He says that many developers would be unwilling to cope with the extra bureaucracy needed to ensure proper accountability and management of public money when they already had well-established relationships with housing associations. These relationships could be threatened if builders were to compete directly with associations. All social housing required some form of long term management which would not interest housebuilders. There was also no suggestion of more government money. The private sector would have to share an already shrinking government budget for social housing, said Mr Cherry. He added: 'Most housebuilders who are working with housing associations are opposed to the idea of direct grant and can see no additional benefits to be gained.' He said that long term partnership schemes involving private sector developers and housing associations were now producing three new homes for the price of two and were proving the most cost effective way of generating more accommodation for people in need.</p>

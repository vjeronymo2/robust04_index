			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: How to find a cure for your CGT headache - Capital gains tax complexities for the private investor 165,000 last year - but probably causes headaches for many more. The tax is payable on only a limited number of assets and there are reliefs available. An individual is entitled to an annual allowance (Pounds 5,500 in 1991-92); to an indexation allowance giving protection from the effects of post-1982 inflation; and to offset losses against gains. In the past five years, many equity investors must have been wishing they had done well enough to worry about CGT. Nevertheless, for substantial private investors, the process of calculating the CGT bill is complex and time-consuming. Without careful planning, the tax can take a nasty bite from your investment profits. Investors often indulge in potentially costly transactions known as 'bed and breakfast' deals to avoid future CGT bills. The end of the tax year is the time for investors to work out their CGT liability. For some, it could be worth realising some gains to use up as much as possible of this year's allowance - it cannot be carried forward. And, there is the election to consider. Labour plans If Labour forms the next government, CGT changes may focus on two issues: the level of annual exemption and the possibility of making a structural reform of the tax. Chris Smith, the party's Treasury spokesman, said Labour does not have immediate plans to change CGT. However, there is speculation that the present annual exemption is likely to be reduced, although it might stay above the level of the basic income tax allowance (Pounds 3,295 at present). Rumours that the annual CGT exemption could be dropped to as low as Pounds 1,000 have been denied robustly. Smith said Labour is considering changes which would relate to the length of time an investment had been held. 'Our medium-term aim is to look at a differential rate to encourage longer-term holdings,' he said. Those with gains realised over a shorter period would, therefore, pay a higher rate than others. Smith added that the tiers might not even be restricted to two bands but could be extended to three. He would not speculate on how long the 'shorter' and 'longer' term might be. Investments which usually are exempt from CGT The good news is that there is a large range of items which do not face the bite of the tax. These include: Your main home (including a caravans or houseboat); personal equity plans; gilts; National Savings (certificates, yearly plan, premium bonds, capital bonds, SAYE deposits); life insurance policies; currency for personal use abroad; betting winnings; shares issued after March 18 1986 under the BES and sold more than five years after you bought them; damages awarded to you for personal or professional wrong or injury; gifts to charities; gift of heritage property; and chattels with a predictable life of no more than 50 years when you first acquired them (so long as they were not used in your business). Gains on chattels with a predictable life of more than 50 years may be CGT-free subject to certain rules.</p>

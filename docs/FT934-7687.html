			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (43): Well worth the risks - Successful joint venture profile: Shanghai Bell 'OUR BIGGEST problem is management' says Mr Bert Degraeve, the Belgian who is general manager of Shanghai Bell, one of Shanghai's most successful joint ventures between Chinese and foreign companies. A shortage of skilled managers is also China's biggest problem in attracting investors, he argues. Set up in 1985, Shanghai Bell Telephone Equipment Manufacturing, epitomises the kind of high-technology investment which China craves. Telephone exchanges and switches from its Shanghai factory, designed to some of the latest overseas standards, are being slotted almost daily into the country's over-stretched telecommunications network. The group was created as a joint venture between the Shanghai Ministry of Post and Telecommunications, which owns 60 per cent; Alcatel Bell, the Belgian telecoms group, which holds 32 per cent; and the Belgian government with 8 per cent. The attractions for the foreign owners are clear. While the Belgian market for exchanges is 300,000 lines a year (a measurement of the exchanges' capacity), the Chinese market is already nine times the size. This year, Shanghai Bell expects turnover to be USDollars 450m, compared to USDollars 230m last year and Dollars 80m in 1990, even though the price of the products has halved in the past eight years. However, the price of entry to the Chinese market was the government's requirement that foreign technology be transfered to the joint venture. Alcatel Bell introduced not only the exchange and switch manufacturing capability, but set up a subsidiary of Shanghai Bell, called Shanghai Belling, to make wafers for silicon chips. In Mr Degraeve's view, foreign companies' concerns about losing control of the business after they have transferred technology 'are justified.' But in the end 'you have to take the risk,' he says. In Shanghai Bell's case, the requirement was easier to fulfil than it had expected: it discovered a virtually unused wafer fabrication plant already in Shanghai, with plastic covers still on the equipment, and took it over. The bigger issue, he argues, is how to transfer management standards. Like other high-tech companies, Alcatel Bell was attracted to Shanghai by the large number of technically qualified graduates emerging from its universities. But although the graduates are technically qualified, one of his hardest tasks is to instill a sense of precision and high standards into his staff. 'You can see the circumstances in which people are living, the crowded rooms, the clutter, the traffic, the noise. Then you expect people to come in this gate and turn around 360 degrees' to produce precisely-engineered products - 'that is what we are demanding of them.' His job is made harder because the Cultural Revolution has left a shortage of trained 40 to 50-year-olds - 'the result is that company structure is then distorted' by a disproportionate number of young staff, he says. Despite these problems, Shanghai Bell believes it has a head start and a competitive advantage which will put it ahead of other rivals; US telecom groups now have the eye on the market. The same may not be true, however, of Belling, its subsidiary. Mr Lu De Chun, Belling's general manager, acknowledges that Belling's chips are some way below the standards of the best international plants. Only between 60 per cent and 90 per cent of wafers pass the tests at the end of the production line, compared to 99 per cent in the most highly automated Japanese plants. Belling's most complicated chips need to be be sent to South Korea and Taiwan for assembly. At the moment, 85 per cent of Belling's business is with Shanghai Bell; the parent company is keen on owning local suppliers of components because of the difficulty and expense of importing.</p>

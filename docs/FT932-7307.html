			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Cairns Group to press G7 over Gatt THE Cairns Group of agricultural exporting countries is to hold a meeting next month aimed at pressing for agreement at the Group of Seven's Tokyo summit in July on a framework for completing the Uruguay Round this year, writes Alexander Nicoll, Asia Editor. Mr Peter Cook, Australian trade minister, said in London yesterday that the meeting in Bangkok on June 26-27 would ensure the interests of the group's 14 members were reflected in Tokyo. He saw encouraging signs that Gatt talks were producing a 'decent' market access package and that differences between the US and the European Community were being bridged. G7 countries, he said, 'must understand that other countries expect the outcome to be genuinely trade-liberalising, and that it will reflect the legitimate interests of all countries, not just the majors'. The importance of agriculture must not be lost in the struggle to resolve differences between the US and EC, he added.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The FSA, which was enacted in 1985, applies to any farmer participating in a federal farm subsidies program. One of the main provisions of the FSA requires farmers who cultivate highly erodible land (which includes the majority of the farmland surrounding Lamar) to develop and implement soil conservation plans. The conservation plan is to document the decisions of an affected farmer with respect to location, land use, tillage systems, and conservation treatment measures and schedules. The plan is to be based on the local Soil Conservation Service technical guide, and it is to be approved by the local soil conservation district. See 16 U.S.C. 3812(a)(2). The law provides that if such a conservation plan is actively applied by January 1, 1990 or 2 years after the Soil Conservation Service has completed a soil survey for the farm, whichever is later, affected farmers shall have until January 1, 1995 to comply with the plan without being subject to ineligibility for certain program loans, payments, and benefits.   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the area surrounding Lamar, approximately 75&hyph;80 percent of the agricultural lands are subject to the soil conservation requirements. According to the Southeast Regional Soil Conservation Service (SCS) office, all of the farmers subject to the FSA in the Lamar area have developed conservation plans, and most of the farmers in the Lamar area have already begun at least partial implementation of these plans. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  The local SCS office has estimated that the implementation of these plans will result in a 70 percent reduction in wind erosion emissions from the non-irrigated farmland surrounding Lamar (which represents 85 percent of the farmland subject to the FSA in the Lamar area).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Per December 4, 1992 telephone coversation between Vicki Stamper, U.S. EPA Region VIII, and Lorenz Sutherland, Southeast Colorado Regional SCS office. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  While the State is relying on these provisions to reduce the PM&hyph;10 emissions from wind erosion in the Lamar area, the State did not adopt these measures into the SIP or take credit for these control measures. Since these measures are federally mandated and will be implemented by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, it is not necessary for the State to adopt these measures into the SIP. No credit was taken for these measures because of the difficulty in estimating the effectiveness of these measures and, moreover, because no credit was needed to demonstrate attainment or maintenance of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS in Lamar (see section II.A.4. of this document). Nevertheless, EPA does believe that the provisions of the FSA will have a significant impact on the emissions from wind erosion from agricultural land in the Lamar area.   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RACT does not require controls on stationary sources in the Lamar nonattainment area because the point source emissions in the Lamar area are de minimis, and control of such sources would not expedite attainment and maintenance of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS. See 57 FR 13540, 13543.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are also Statewide control measures that apply in the Lamar area. Colorado Regulation No. 4 requires new wood stoves to meet the emission requirements of EPA's Standards of Performance for New Residential Wood Heaters in 40 CFR 60.532(b). Colorado Regulation No. 3 regulates the construction and modification of new stationary sources of PM&hyph;10. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  These measures will help to reduce emissions from new stationary source growth and residential wood combustion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> The State is required by the amended Clean Air Act to adopt a revised new source review permit program for the construction and operation of new and modified stationary sources. See Section 189(a)(1)(A). This SIP revision, which was submitted by the State on January 15, 1993, was due independent of the November 15, 1991 moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area SIP requirements addressed in this action and will be addressed in a separate notice. See section 189(a)(2)(A) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> A more detailed discussion of the individual source contributions, the associated control measures, and an explanation as to why certain available control measures were not adopted, can be found in the TSD. EPA has reviewed the State's explanation and associated documentation and concluded that it adequately justifies the control measures to be implemented. The Lamar PM&hyph;10 SIP demonstrates that the area will attain the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS by December 31, 1994. By this notice, EPA is proposing to approve Colorado's SIP submittal for Lamar as meeting the RACM (including RACT) requirement. However, EPA is not proposing action on Regulations No. 3 and 4 because EPA has previously approved these regulations in separate actions (see the TSD for further information).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> 4. Demonstration   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> As noted, the initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas must submit a demonstration (including air quality modeling) showing that the plan will provide for attainment as expeditiously as practicable but no later than December 31, 1994 (see section 189(a)(1)(B) of the Act). Alternatively, the State must show that attainment by December 31, 1994 is impracticable.   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA regulations provide that the adequacy of a control strategy to provide for timely attainment must be demonstrated by means of a proportional model or dispersion model or other procedure which is shown to be adequate and appropriate (see 40 CFR 51.112(a)). EPA policy specifies that the preferred approach for estimating the air quality impacts of emissions of PM&hyph;10 is to use receptor modeling in combination with dispersion modeling. However, on July 5, 1990, EPA issued guidance providing that, in certain situations, it may be more appropriate to rely on a receptor model demonstration alone as the basis for the attainment demonstration (see July 5, 1990 memo to Regional Air Branch Chiefs from Robert D. Bauman, Chief of SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> /Particulate Matter Programs Branch and Joseph Tikvart, Chief of Source Receptor Analysis Branch). Lamar met the criteria discussed in the July 5, 1990 memo to justify using receptor modeling alone and had originally planned to use this approach in its attainment demonstration. However, after further review, the State determined that the chemical mass balance (CMB) analysis (i.e., analysis of source contributions from PM&hyph;10 monitoring filters) to be used in the receptor model was inadequate and decided to base the attainment and maintenance demonstration on simple emissions rollback modeling, which involves using the ratio of the design day ambient concentration of 101 &mu;g/m3 to the design day emissions and projecting future concentrations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

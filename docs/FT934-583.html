			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / London outpaces continental bourses as investors pour in The London stock market climbed to another record close yesterday as dealers scrambled for shares to balance their trading books before Christmas. The move reflected a positive investment environment throughout continental Europe where five of the six top bourses hit new highs yesterday. German institutional investors took Frankfurt up just more than 1 per cent to a fresh record as west German inflation figures showed a slowing monthly figure. Paris was lifted to its highest close by a strong French bond market and an inflow from mutual funds. Among the others, in Zurich, Amsterdam and Madrid, equities hit their fifth consecutive record figures, boosted by continued strong liquidity and hopes of lower interest rates in the new year. But the gain of about 1.2 per cent in London outpaced gains in the other European bourses. The FT-SE 100 Index, which represents the UK's 100 most highly valued companies, closed up 40.8 on the day at 3,396.5 after breaking briefly through 3,400. The London market is fuelled by hopes that bank base rates will fall again in the new year, down from the current 5.5 per cent. Renewed demand for shares yesterday caught out the market-making firms, which were already having great difficulty finding stock for delivery to the buyers who have been driving the market ahead for the past month. The FT-SE 100 has risen more than 1,000 points since the UK left the European exchange rate mechanism in September 1992. This year investment institutions and the securities firms that service them have made substantial profits. Buying pressure was exacerbated by continuing background activity in the derivatives markets. Foreign investors have been funnelling money into the UK since the summer and using derivatives as an efficient way into the stock market.

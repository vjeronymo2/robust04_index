			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Beirut, 3 Jun (JANA) -- The Israeli enemy has  perpetrated an abominable massacre in the heart of Lebanese  territory against Lebanese nationals, which left 45 dead and  over 70 others injured. This attack, which targeted densely  populated areas, showed total disregard for international  conventions and charters.    Israeli war planes yesterday launched air raids on several  villages and towns north of Ba'labak, and these raids also  caused extensive damage to property. Press reports indicate  that the Israeli planes dropped large quantities of bombs and  tried to land but were prevented from doing so by the Lebanese  antiaircraft defense on the ground. [passage omitted]    A source at the General People's Committee for Unity stated  last week that the Israeli enemy is continuing its aggression  against the Arab nation and is violating its sovereignty and  territory with its military arsenal and weapons of destruction  supplied by the West, mainly the U.S. Government, in a blatant  defiance of all international resolutions. Moreover, their  conspiratorial acts are stepped up whenever they want to impose  further capitulation on the Arab regimes against the will of the  masses, which reject defeat and surrender.    The violations and the aggression taking place today against  Lebanon's sovereignty and its Arab people must be an incentive  for frustrating all attempts of capitulation and attempts to  impose the fait accompli. It must also be an incentive for  confronting this act of aggression with the responsibility  required by the Arab charters, foremost the Joint Arab Defense  Treaty, so that Lebanon is no longer a daily target for the  aggression of the Israelis and their savage raids, whose aim is  to attack civilians and break the strong spirit of resistance to  the Israeli enemy and to the occupation.    Proceeding from the constants of the great 1 September  revolution and in accordance with the resolutions adopted by the  Basic People's Congresses, which stressed the need to confront  the continuous imperialist-backed Israeli aggression against the  Arab nation, the General People's Committee for Unity in the  Great Jamahiriyah condemns Israel's terrorism, which is  manifested in its continued occupation of Arab territories, from  southern Lebanon to the Golan Heights and in the Umm Rashrash  [Elat] area. It also condemns its practice of aggression and  its kidnapping of civilians, which nobody tries to prevent the  Israeli entity from following. We also call for the  implementation of the Arab charters and treaties to confront  this situation.</p>

			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / UK 'tough' with Iraq BRITAIN yesterday summoned Iraq's senior diplomat in London to demand the release of two Britons detained in Baghdad, following charges that the US administration had acted much more robustly to free an American citizen held by Iraq. The two Britons, Mr Paul Ride and Mr Michael Wainwright, are serving long jail sentences after being convicted of entering the country illegally. Mr Chad Hall, the American citizen freed by the Iraqi authorities at the weekend after being held for only two days, was detained on a similar charge of illegal entry. Mr David Gore-Booth, deputy under-secretary at the Foreign Office, was 'extremely tough' in demanding a response from the Iraqis. The Foreign Office has clearly been stung into action by complaints of the families of the two imprisoned men and by opposition politicians that Britain has been doing too little to secure their release.</p>

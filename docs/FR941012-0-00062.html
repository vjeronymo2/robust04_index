			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Finally, several commenters said that employers should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not be required to pay for certain PPE because the custom in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the logging industry is that employees, especially piece-rate workers, provide their own PPE, particularly logging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> boots (Ex. 5&hyph;11, 5&hyph;24, 5&hyph;45, 5&hyph;67, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These commenters said that piece-rate workers provide all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``tools of the trade,'' that includes some types of PPE.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the record also shows that some logging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establishments do provide logging boots (Ex. 5&hyph;32; Tr. W1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 177). For example, one commenter said: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> [T]he way we set it up is that when you're with us  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for one year we will buy you three pair of boots  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and we will supply all safety equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After you are with us for one month, we will supply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety chaps, the helmet, the whole works. The first  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> day you come on the job we will supply the helmet, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> helmet with the eye protection and the ear protection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Tr. W1 177).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter said:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In most instances items such as ear plugs, safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> glasses, bucking chaps or any other safety item  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to work in a safe environment are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided (Ex. 5&hyph;32). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OSHA has carefully reviewed the evidence in the record  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and, for several reasons, has decided in the final rule to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delete the general requirement that the employer be required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to provide logging boots. However, the final rule does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require that such boots be worn by logging employees, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> holds the employer responsible for assuring that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employee has logging boots and wears them. As to the other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> PPE requirements specified in paragraph (d), OSHA has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retained the language of the pulpwood logging and proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards that the employer provide such PPE at no cost to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the employee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The OSH Act imposes on employers the responsibility for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance with standards and for providing safe working  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions for employees. This responsibility has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recognized in OSHA's personal protective equipment standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at 29 CFR 1910.132 through 29 CFR 1910.138. Section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1910.132(a) establishes the employer's obligation to provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and maintain personal protective equipment whenever such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment is necessary by reason of the hazards in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> workplace.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1910.132(b) does recognize that in some limited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumstances that employees may provide their own PPE.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, OSHA emphasizes that this practice is not the norm,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but rather an exception based on unusual or specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumstances. In addition, section 1910.132(b) underscores  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the employer's continuing obligation to assure the adequacy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and maintenance of the PPE.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The record shows that special circumstances exist in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the logging industry which may make it appropriate for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employees to provide their own logging boots. First, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> record shows that the logging industry is highly transient,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and that logging boots, unlike other PPE required by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final rule, are not the kind of PPE that can be reused.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Logging boots purchased to fit one employee may not fit the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> next employee. It is important that logging boots fit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> properly or the boot may not provide the necessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protection. Therefore, based on current turnover rates in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the industry, employers would have to purchase non-reusable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> logging boots costing $200 to $400 many times a year for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> newly-hired employees, even though there is a significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> likelihood that these employees will remain in the job for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only a short time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, the record shows that logging employees tend to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> move from one logging establishment to another, taking their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``tools of the trade'' with them, particularly their logging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> boots. OSHA believes it may be appropriate in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> situation to allow employees to take their logging boots to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the next place of employment, rather than requiring the new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employer to provide logging boots. Logging boots are both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> portable (i.e., not limited in use to or maintained at a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particular workplace, like respirators for instance) and in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> most cases they fit only that particular employee therefore  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they cannot be reused by other employees. The other items  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of PPE required by the final rule, such as leg and head  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protection, tend to be both less personal to the employee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and more connected to the workplace itself, and can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> readily used by other employees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

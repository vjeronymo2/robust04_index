			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / How to Spend It: 'That's just what I've always wanted' - Gift ideas for the person with a special interest, here are a number of suggestions that you might not have thought of . . . / The Cook What to buy for enthusiasts and experts - it is an annual dilemma. Their hobbies ought to provide a host of ideas. But what if they have already got your chosen gift, or - even worse - what if it is not the right make or design? The Weekend FT's experts offer some suggestions . . . Three gifts please: one to get the day off to a good start, the second to facilitate cooking for the next decade at least, and the third to allow my family and friends to enjoy our meals together even more in 1995. The first is a chrome plated citrus press that will produce sensational fresh orange juice for breakfast (without which no breakfast is complete). It is German and costs Pounds 43.40 from Divertimenti, SW3 (071-581 8065) or W1 (071-935 0689). One fell swoop of the hand lever produces just the juice  -no pips or pith. Just as good later in the day when you need lemon or lime juice for cooking. The second, which would definitely necessitate a large sack, would be the full range of Global cooking knives. These are Japanese, the blades made from Molybdenum/vanadium stainless steel which has been icetempered and hardened so that they remain razor sharp longer than other steel and resist rust, stains and corrosion. I have ogled them in Richard Dare's kitchen shop, NW1 (071-722 9428) and even held them - they are perfectly weighted. But the cheapest costs Pounds 25 and the complete range comprises 29 knives so I have put them down quickly. Finally, one of the biggest transformations in cooking around the world over the past decade has been the increased use of different oils - olive, hazelnut, sesame, walnut are the most common but pistachio, pineseed, groundnut and almond oil are distinctive, too. I would like a mixed case please from an everyday, fruity olive oil for cooking to an extra virgin cold pressed olive oil, a type that now commands such high prices that they are usually only available in designer half bottles. Santa Claus for this present would take the form of a delivery man from The Oil Merchant, W12 (081-740 1335) or Taylor &amp; Lake, SW8 (071-622 9156). And my wish for 1995 - that somehow there will be enough food for everyone on this planet.</p>

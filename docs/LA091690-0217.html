			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MISSING MANNERS  </P> <P> I couldn't agree more with the comment made by Kaufman's sister: "Dating is  where the shameless really shine." As a 27-year-old woman who has been dating  for several years, I have encountered som very ill-mannered individuals.  </P> <P> On one unfortunate date, the man with whom I was having dinner proceeded to  tell me that at that particular moment, he could call nine or 10 women and they  would go out with them just like that, and he snapped his fingers. I didn't  know whether I should say something like "That's great. Maybe you should start  a baseball team" or call a taxi. Being the polite person I am, I didn't say a  thing and sat through dinner listening to how rich, successful, handsome, tall  and educated this guy was. He forgot to mention he was also an egomaniac.  </P> <P> What ever happened to the old-fashioned notion of just being nice and honest. I  guess the trend now is to be rude. Oh well, I have never been able to keep up  with the trends.  </P> <P> ELENA ANAGNOSTOPOULOS  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

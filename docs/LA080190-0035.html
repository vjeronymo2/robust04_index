			<p><P> August 1, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Show Goes On for Grateful Dead: The Grateful Dead will go ahead with planned  shows despite the death last week of keyboard player Brent Mydland, and it is  uncertain when a replacement for Mydland will be named. "It's possible that  they'll start off (without a new member)," said publicist Dennis McNally of the  tour that begins Aug. 31 with a three-night Bay Area stand in Mountain View and  continues on the East Coast and in Europe. A report that Dead fan and friend  Bruce Hornsby had been invited to join the band for some of the shows was  labeled unfounded by both McNally and Hornsby's manager, Tim Neese.

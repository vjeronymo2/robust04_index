			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / HK airport project chief replaced HONG KONG'S business community was last night taken by surprise when Mr Richard Allen, the man who has overseen the construction of Hong Kong's new airport for the past two years, was replaced as chief executive of the Provisional Airport Authority (PAA), Simon Holberton writes from Hong Kong. The PAA said that Mr Allen would be succeeded as chief executive today by Mr Hank Townsend, a senior executive of Bechtel Corporation. Mr Townsend was until recently an adviser to the Hong Kong government on its HKDollars 175bn (Pounds 16bn) airport and related infrastructure projects. After a meeting of the board of the PAA, the authority released a statement saying Mr Allen was leaving by mutual agreement. In two years Mr Allen built up the PAA from nothing to an organisation employing 200 people. He was seen as less successful in building harmonious relationships with the PAA's contractors. The airport project, expected to cost in excess of HKDollars 60bn, has been dogged by the long-running dispute between Britain and China about the colony's political development. This row has cast doubt over the PAA's ability to complete the project before Hong Kong reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.</p>

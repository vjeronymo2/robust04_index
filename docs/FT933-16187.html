			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / UK Gilts: Strong pound revives interest rate hopes THE BETTING in the gilt market that the UK government will cut interest rates in the foreseeable future strengthened on the back of monetary easing in Germany and a stronger pound. Gilt prices recorded another healthy rise over the week, with the gains especially marked at the short end of the yield curve. Even though Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer, has ruled out cutting interest rates in the short term, few people in the gilt market expect him to keep to his word should the next spate of UK economic data indicate that signs of recovery are weakening. While today's announcement of the latest figures for consumer credit will provide some signs of underlying demand in the economy, most of the action on gilts trading will probably be postponed until next week, when the new data include figures for last month's inflation and unemployment. Over the week, 10-year gilts saw a fall in yields of about 7 basis points, for a yield reduction of a healthy 45 basis points in the past month. On Friday night, the 8 per cent Treasury bond maturing in 2003 was quoted at 102 5/8 , up about half a point on the week, with its yield registering 7.6 per cent. The gilt market shrugged off the relative lack of success of a Pounds 3.25bn auction of 10-year bonds, the biggest ever, which attracted generally poor support from overseas investors. The cover - the ratio of offers to accepted bids - was only 1.1. This means that with only slightly less bidding not all the issue would have been sold. However, a rally in the market later prompted the Bank of England to issue Pounds 800m of 15-year bonds which attracted some buying interest on Thursday and Friday. The Bank is also issuing today Pounds 300m of index-linked bonds, in the form of Pounds 150m of 2.5 per cent stock due 2009 and the same amount of 2.5 per cent bonds maturing in 2024. The Bank is well advanced with its fund-raising. In the first three months of the year it has borrowed roughly Pounds 20bn, two-thirds through auctions and the rest through taps and other gilt sales. This leaves it in a reasonably good position to borrow the money it needs to fund the expected Pounds 50bn deficit for 1993-94. Many in the market take the view that investors, both in the UK and abroad, are well poised to buy this level of gilts, assuming that little happens to upset notions that inflation is under control. Last week's announcement that pay rises in manufacturing in the three months to the end of April averaged just 2.1 per cent, the lowest figure since the Confederation of British Industry started recording these numbers in 1977, further underlined theories that inflation pressures are subdued for the time being. Sterling's strength has helped the gilt market to show its recent healthy tone. On Friday, the pound's value as measured by the Bank's trade-weight index edged up to 81.4 - close to the high for the year of 81.6 registered two months ago - with a generally good showing against both the D-Mark and the dollar. Even though it closed slightly down on Friday night against the D-Mark at 2.5575, this was only  1/2 pfennig below its highest level for the year against the currency. While few figures last week gave any concrete indications of the speed of any recovery, most of the anecdotal evidence gave the impression of economic weakness. In particular, a record number of businesses collapsed in England, Wales and Scotland in the second quarter, illustrating specifically the fragile state of many small companies. Although figures for company failures are generally thought of as giving few insights into future economic trends, it may not require many more pieces of poor economic news before Mr Clarke starts to think seriously about bringing down base rates from 6 per cent for the first cut since January. The cut in German interest rates last week - the discount rate came down  1/2 percentage point to 6.75 per cent and the Lombard rate fell  1/4 point to 8.25 per cent - may create a better backcloth for such a move.</p>

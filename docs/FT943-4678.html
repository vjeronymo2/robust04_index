			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / US displaces Japan as most competitive nation After eight years as undisputed economic pacesetter Japan has lost its ranking as the world's most competitive economy to the US. It has slipped to third place after Singapore, according to the latest World Competitiveness Report published today. Three other East Asian nations - Hong Kong, Malaysia and Taiwan - make the top 20 while Italy, with the world's fifth largest economy, comes an ignominious 32nd out of 41 nations assessed - behind Turkey, Colombia and Indonesia. Germany, the highest rated European country, comes fifth. The rankings, which attempt to measure the ability of a country to outperform its competitors, are compiled annually by the Swiss-based International Institute for Management Development and the World Economic Forum. This is the first time industrialised and developing countries have been included in the same scoreboard, although China and Russia were excluded for lack of comparable information. Countries are ranked in eight areas, such as domestic economic strength, infrastructure and management, on the basis of 381 criteria which range from computers per capita to alcohol and drug abuse. About a third of the data comes from a poll of 2,850 business executives worldwide. The US resurgence is attributed principally to the strong and early economic recovery, coupled with high scores on entrepreneurship, internationalisation and 'financial vitality'. Japan's ranking has been hit by the worst economic recession in decades and increasing disaffection with the political system, although it continues to lead in management and technology. Second-placed Singapore, which has consistently topped the competitiveness rankings among developing countries, is rated first for the extent to which government policies help competitiveness, and for the quality of its labour force. Hong Kong, which came fourth overall, remains handicapped by uncertainties over China's repossession of the colony in 1997. Germany and Switzerland head a fairly stable European pack. Britain came 14th in the global league but moved up two places in the European rankings (from 11th to 9th) on the back of deregulation moves and economic recovery. Italy's performance reflects a gloomy opinion survey due to 'the profound disenchantment of the Italian people with everything which touches their government or public institutions'. On government policies, Italy was rated bottom among the 41 nations. The latest rankings also show good performances by Chile, Mexico, Argentina and Colombia. Lean and mean, Page 4</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Final regulations published on May 14, 1993 (58 FR 28660), establish a recycling program for ozone-depleting refrigerants recovered during the servicing and disposal of air-conditioning and refrigeration equipment. Together with the prohibition on venting during the service, repair, and disposal of class I and class II substances (see the listing notice January 22, 1991; 56 FR 2420) that took effect on July 1, 1992, these regulations should substantially reduce the emissions of ozone-depleting refrigerants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The petition filed by the CMA asks for reconsideration of leak repair provisions under &sect;82.156(i) as they relate to industry process refrigeration equipment. In particular, the petitioners raised concerns regarding the ability to repair or retrofit some industrial process refrigeration equipment within the timeframes established by the final rule. CMA's concerns involve the need to shut down equipment and/or obtain custom built parts within the appropriate timeframes. CMA also raised the possibility of delays caused by other regulatory requirements related to changes at plants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has evaluated CMA's information and is now reconsidering the leak repair provisions in light of this information. Moreover, EPA believes that this information warrants review and response pursuant to section 307(d)(7)(B) of the Clean Air Act. In order to review and evaluate the ability of the owners and operators of industrial process refrigeration equipment to comply with the leak repair provisions when extenuating circumstances exist, EPA will reconsider the regulatory requirements applicable to repairing leaks in accordance with section 307(d) of the Clean Air Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Issuance of Stay  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA hereby issues a three-month administrative stay of the effectiveness of provisions of &sect;82.156(i) as they apply to industrial process refrigeration equipment, including all applicable compliance dates, promulgated as final federal rules requiring the reduction of emissions of ozone-depleting substances during the servicing and disposal of air-conditioning and refrigeration equipment (58 FR 28660). EPA will reconsider these rules, as discussed above and, following the notice and comment procedures of section 307(d) of the Clean Air Act, will take appropriate action. If, after reconsideration of these provisions, EPA determines that it is appropriate to impose leak repair requirements that are stricter than the existing rules, EPA will propose an adequate compliance period from the date of final action on reconsideration. EPA will seek to ensure that the affected parties are not unduly prejudiced by the Agency's reconsideration. Any EPA proposal regarding changes to the leak repair requirements and the appropriate compliance period would be subject to the notice and comment procedures of Clean Air Act section 307(d).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the settlement agreement between EPA and CMA set a tight deadline for the completion of the rulemaking, EPA will reconsider the rules in question as expeditiously as practicable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Authority for Stay and Reconsideration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The administrative stay and reconsideration of the rules and associated compliance periods announced by this notice are being undertaken pursuant to section 307(d)(7)(B) of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7607(d)(7)(B). That provision authorizes the Administrator to stay the effectiveness of a rule for three months if it was impracticable to raise an objection or if the grounds for an objection arose after the period for public comment and if the objection is of central relevance to the outcome of the rule. Because some of the issues in the petition for reconsideration may have been impracticable to raise during the comment period, EPA is authorized to stay the effectiveness of the relevant provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Proposed Additional Temporary Stay  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA may not be able to complete the reconsideration (including any appropriate regulatory action) of the rules stayed by this notice within the three-month period expressly provided in section 307(d)(7)(B). If EPA does not complete the reconsideration in this timeframe, then it might be appropriate to extend temporarily the stay of the effectiveness of the leak repair requirements for industrial process refrigeration and applicable compliance dates until EPA completes final rulemaking action upon reconsideration. EPA is going through notice and comment rulemaking to decide whether to extend the stay beyond this initial three-month period. In the Proposed Rules Section of today's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , EPA proposes a temporary extension of the stay beyond the three months, only to the extent necessary to complete reconsideration of the rules in question.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Effective Date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This action will become final on September 16, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

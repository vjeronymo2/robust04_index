			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Third installment of four-part article by Shinobu Takeda of </F> NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN's Industrial News Department: "Centennial  Change in Construction Industry"]    [Text] Leading general contractors were all banned from  bidding for public works projects in relation to a series of  bribery scandals, and as a result, excluded from public works.  Also, controls within bid-rigging groups are weakening.  Unexpected changes at the construction sites of public works  are emerging nationwide. For example, companies from different  types of businesses or from other prefectures are winning  contracts, something inconceivable in the past. Because the  change is so sudden, local gpvernments and the construction  industry are not able to cope with it.  <H5>  General Contractors as Subcontractors </H5>   Takao Mikoshiba, managing director of Ishikawajima-Harima  Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. [Ishihari], said in bewilderment, "We  do not have the experience of using general contractors as  subcontractors...." His concern results from the fact that his  company has been awarded a lump-sum contract for not only the  machinery part but also the civil engineering part of the  construction of a basement parking lot in Fukui City which is  worth approximately 51 million yen in total. But, the  management of engineering works for a machinery manufacturer is  impossible. Although there is a need to subcontract general  contractors, they are usually Ishihari's large clients from whom  it takes up orders for such construction machinery as shield  drilling machines and cranes. Until the completion of the  construction due in March 1996, the person in charge of the  project at Ishihari will not feel relaxed.    Many local governments are in trouble because the bribery  scandals involving general contractors have widened and too many  companies are disqualified from bidding for public works  projects. A construction company in Niigata says, "The  prefectural government mainly awarded contracts to Takenaka  Komuten Co., Ltd., which was not involved in the scandals.  However, Takenaka was not able to cope with the task since its  know-how was limited."    Although Obayashi Corporation was suspended from bidding  because its vice president and executives were arrested on  suspicion of bribing former mayor of Sendai, it was not excluded  from the construction of Sendai's Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG)  base. Also, Nagano City has unofficially contracted with a  joint venture (JV) that includes Kajima Corporation, which was  barred from bidding in March, for the construction of the main  structure of speed skate rink for the [1998 Nagano] Winter  Olympics.    Because so many companies were involved in bribery scandals,  the Sendai City government had to reselect the contractors for  the LNG base construction project twice before it finally  contracted with Obayashi and JDC Corporation. Under the  pressing conditions in which no more delay was allowed because  the time limit for a change from town gas to natural gas was  approaching, the Sendai City government had no choice but to  ignore the fact that Obayashi had been banned from bidding for  public works projects.    The case of Nagano City is the same. Plenty of larch is used  in building a speed skate rink that has an elaborate wooden  structure with a suspended roof. Changing the members of the JV  was impossible because the time left for the construction to be  completed before the opening of the Nagano Olympics was barely  enough. Shigeru Ban, Structure Design manager at Kajima which  designed the rink, said in high spirits, "We will build a unique  facility that cannot be found anywhere else."  <H5>  "80 Percent of Estimated Price" </H5>   Under a conditional open competitive bidding system  introduced experimentally by the Hiroshima prefectural  government, Daioh Corporation (Kochi City, President Kusuo  Yasuoka), a Shikoku-based construction firm, won the contracts  for the construction of administration building of Hiroshima  Prefectural Junior College of Health and Welfare at Mihara, and  tunnel construction for a prefectural road in Fukuyama City.  The fact that a construction company from a different  prefecture at the other side of the Inland Sea won a contract in  Hiroshima has attracted attention as well as the fact that its  bid price was "80 percent of the prefectural government's  estimated price," (according to a medium general contractor).    "In the construction industry, the overall profit margin for  completed construction projects is approximately 10 percent.  When the difference between the estimated price and the bid  price is larger than that, there is no profit," Kenji Maeda,  chairman of Japan Federation of Construction Contractors, Inc.,  says. In Hiroshima, the managing director responsible for the  Hiroshima branch office of a major general contractor is said to  be still active as the coordinator for a bid-rigging group. He  has not tolerated a company to place a bid at a low price that  deviates from the concerted actions of other bid-riggers. But,  it seems that he was not able to control companies outside the  prefecture. Things are changing from their roots at the  forefront of bidding for public works projects in the local  areas.  <H5>  Restricting Entry of Companies </H5>   At the second floor of a building in front of JR [Japan  Railways] Kannai Station in Yokohama is Purchasing Section,  Property Custody Division, Planning and Finance Bureau of the  Yokohama City government. A paper which reads "Businessmen, No  Entry Please" has been posted next to the reception desk since  last January. There is also a notice next to it saying,  "Consultation is offered at the section next to the reception."  Although some construction companies protested, "Are you going  not to let us do business?" Terumasa Ikeda, chief of Purchasing  Section, refuted, "What kind of business activity is possible by  coming inside our office?"    As a matter of fact, whether one can go beyond the reception  desk and enter the office is a big problem for small and medium  construction firms. Almost lacking the ability to determine a  bid price by making estimates on their own, they have used  former officials of the autonomous bodies and have them talk  with the person responsible for a public works project to find  out the estimated price of the project, and used the price as a  reference up to now. This practice will be no longer possible.    "Making an estimate for a project before bidding will cost  you about 0.5 percent of the amount of a contract, if you do it  seriously," Tetsu Goto, president of Tokyu Construction Co.,  Ltd., says. Under the open competitive bidding system, a  construction company might suffer a total loss after failing to  win a number of contracts. There is a possibility that, "a firm  that earns about 10 billion yen a year can go bankrupt for the  estimation costs after placing 10 unsuccessful bids." Prior to  the introduction of open competitive bidding system, Yokohama  City held hearings on the new system with the local construction  companies, and the firms requested one after another to "reduce  the number of projects to be contracted under the open bidding  system as much as possible."    Many local autonomous bodies have started to consider the  introduction of entry restriction similar to that of Yokohama.  It is becoming more difficult for construction companies to  walk around the lobbies of the government offices and collect  information. Also in the United States, gathering information  through former government officials is difficult. Because of  this, there has been a scandal in which a congressman was used  to collect information for a bidding from the section in charge.  "In Japan also, local assembly members might be used," says the  person in charge at a major general contractor, frowning at the  next possible cause of corruption.</p>

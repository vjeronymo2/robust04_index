			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> BIG KIDS SPOIL FUN AS LEUZINGER ROLLS OVER HAWTHORNE, 76-65  </P> <P> Leave it to the big kids to spoil all the fun for the little guys.  </P> <P> Hawthorne and Leuzinger High Schools' youthful backcourt players were having a  great time trading baskets -- just like a neighborhood pickup game -- in the  first half of their El Segundo tournament semifinal game Wednesday night in the  El Segundo High gym.  </P> <P> That was before Leuzinger's big, bad seniors -- center Frank Willis and power  forward Ty Merriweather -- started throwing bodies around in the second half.  Willis and Merriweather were all business in leading Leuzinger to a 76-65  victory.  </P> <P> But this latest chapter of one of South Bay's most intense cross-town rivalries  was fun while it lasted.  </P> <P> "It's like family out there," Leuzinger Coach Phil Sherman said. "The kids on  both teams are all friends. You don't see too many tempers flare up out there."  </P> <P> Sherman starts a pair of sophomores in his backcourt, while Hawthorne's Richard  Wells starts a sophomore and a junior. In the first three quarters, the  talented youngsters put on a show.  </P> <P> Leuzinger sophomore Troy Matthews scored 10 of his 14 points -- including two  three-point baskets -- before halftime.  </P> <P> And 15-year-old sophomore Dominic Ellison scored 15 of his 17 in the half,  including a pair of leaning jump shots from the baseline that brought Hawthorne  a 39-39 tie at the buzzer. Ellison, a crafty ballhandler, added 13 assists on  the night.  </P> <P> Hawthorne junior Shanta Cotright finished with 17 points, but Leuzinger's  Willis -- a 6-foot-8 post player -- dominated the boards and Merriweather took  advantage by scoring several easy inside baskets to help the Olympians (3-0)  pull away in the second half.  </P> <P> Willis finished with 17 points and Merriweather led all scorers with 19.  </P> <P> Senior guard Robert Northern added 12 points for Leuzinger and sophomore Antwan  Lewis scored eight.  </P> <P> Leuzinger advances to meet the winner of tonight's 7:30 semifinal between El  Segundo and Mira Costa in the championship game Friday night at 7:30.  </P> <P> Hawthorne dropped to 2-4.  </P></p>

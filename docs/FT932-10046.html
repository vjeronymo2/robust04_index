			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Tomkins' thin slices Tomkins' latest trading announcement does little to dispel the view that the conglomerate is more intent on rewriting numbers on bits of paper than taking decisive steps to reshape Ranks Hovis McDougall. Tomkins' shares have wobbled recently so it decided to release a progress report before entering its closed period. Given current sensitivities about price-sensitive information, such an approach is certainly to be commended. That said, not a lot emerged. Much of the progress made has been pretty standard stuff. Tomkins has chopped about 5 per cent of RHM's workforce  - or 1,500 jobs. It has shut RHM's UK and US head offices. Some of RHM's sacred cows - such as its research and development budget - have already gone through the mincer. Tomkins will take a Pounds 90m provision to cover such costs. Although the scale of provisioning is not large by the standards of a BTR or Hanson, it still represents about 7 per cent of the purchase price. David Tweedie would hardly approve. As a piece of financial engineering, the acquisition's appeal is now becoming apparent. The industrial logic, though, remains as opaque as ever. The rationalisation of RHM's milling and baking businesses is proceeding much as the previous management had already outlined. The great assault on the industry's capacity problems has not yet been made. Meanwhile, the competition may even intensify. ABF has lost several percentage points of market share in the past few years. It seems rather keen to win it back.</p>

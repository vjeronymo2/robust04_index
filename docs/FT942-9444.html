			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Swedish stock futures already a significant market Sir, I read with some interest of the Sydney Futures Exchange's plans to launch individual stock futures on May 16 ('Sydney to trade share futures', May 12), but was rather dismayed that the existing market for Swedish stock futures was not given the credit it deserves. Stock futures have been listed on both OMLX, the London Securities and Derivatives Exchange and OM Stockholm for several years. At present, a total of 23 Swedish companies has stock futures available on them and it is our intention to launch further contracts in due course. As such, this can hardly be described as a 'handful'. I would also like to point out that volumes are rising at an exponential rate. The year-on-year increase to the end of April was some 238 per cent with almost 90,000 contracts traded. I would also like to point out that, with a total volume of 23.3m contracts, the total volume of Swedish derivatives traded last year exceeded that of the Sydney Futures Exchange by 1.75m contracts, thus making it a significant market in outright and comparative terms. David Courtney, marketing director, OMLX, The London Securities and Derivatives Exchange, 107 Cannon Street, London EC4N 5AD</p>

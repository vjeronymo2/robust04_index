			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / A tick on the old clock: Vanessa Houlder explains why every second counts Insomniacs will find tomorrow night even longer than usual. The night will be extended by an extra second, to correct the earth's erratic timekeeping. The extra second will be inserted at midnight, Greenwich Mean Time; but in the UK, this means at 1am on Friday, because British Summer Time is one hour ahead. An extra second will be broadcast in the national time signal, which is transmitted by Rugby Radio Station, and the BBC may broadcast seven 'pips' in its time signal instead of six. This leap second, as it is called, highlights some unexpected complexities in the practical aspects of keeping time. For technicians, as well as philosophers, the nature of time is a curiously elusive concept. The difficulty does not lie in the accuracy of clocks. In 1955, when atomic clocks were introduced, it became possible to keep time with hitherto unknown precision. These clocks, which work by monitoring the frequency at which an atom of the chemical element Caesium vibrates, are accurate to one second in 1m years. Rather, the problem arises with the traditional way of measuring time, namely the length of a day. The length of the day depends on the speed at which the earth rotates, which - despite appearances - is not constant. Like a spinning top which gradually loses its momentum, the earth is slowing down. As a result, it is occasionally necessary to add an extra second to clocks, to keep them in step with the length of the day. 'It is a compromise,' says Ms Martine Feissel, director of Central Bureau of the International Earth Rotation Service, a Paris-based organisation created in 1988. 'On the one hand, there is high precision international atomic time. At the same time we do not want to be too far from the earth's rotation.' The service is the world's authority on when clocks should introduce a leap second. From its 30 radio stations all over the world, it makes minute measurements of quasars - objects in the sky so remote that they can be assumed to be fixed - from which it can calculate the earth's movements and hence the moment at which it is appropriate to realign clocks. The service decides whether to add a leap second six months in advance of its introduction, which is generally in June or December - although there is provision for the leap second to be introduced in March or September. Ms Feissel cautiously predicts that the next leap second is likely to be at the end of June next year. If so, it will be the 20th leap second to be introduced since 1972. Before then, measurements of time were less precise. At first sight, the addition of 19 leap seconds in 22 years suggests that the earth is slowing down remarkably quickly. In fact, even if the speed of the earth's rotation were to stabilise, the earth rotation service would still be forced to declare the occasional leap second. The reason lies with the definition of the atomic second, which is the equivalent of 9.19bn vibrations in a Caesium atom. When the second was redefined in terms of atomic vibrations in the 1960s, scientists decided to base it on the length of a day in 1900, which is an important reference point for astronomers. That means the occasional leap second is needed just to make up for the slowdown in the earth's rotation which has already occurred since 1900. In principle, negative leap seconds, in which the seconds are left out rather than inserted, could be needed as well as leap seconds. Although the long-term trend is for the earth to rotate more slowly, there are periods when it speeds up, for complex reasons concerning winds, tides and the movement of the earth's molten core. Is the time, money and effort spent on synchronising clocks with the earth's movements well spent? On the face of it, the worst that would happen if they were allowed to get out of kilter, is that the sun, moon and stars would rise and set a few seconds earlier than previously. After all, for most people, an extra second here or there is a matter of supreme indifference. But for a small group of people, Thursday's realignment of clocks is vital. For some scientists and navigators, clocks must remain in close synchronisation with the rotation of the earth. Anyone using astro-navigation on the high seas would find that a one-second mistake could result in an error of a quarter of a mile in a ship's position. And that could prove fatal.</p>

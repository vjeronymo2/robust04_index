			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev, [no dateline as received] -- A regular two-day  round of negotiations between Russian and Ukraine on issues of  dividing the Black Sea Fleet ended 9 June. The sides were led  by Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov and Yuriy  Dubinin, Russia's ambassador-at-large.    According to Shamrov, the current round was marked by a  desire to find a compromise decision to solve the Black Sea  Fleet issue. "After an agreement in principle was reached on  dividing the fleets, specific lists of ships and vessels as well  as the infrastructure subject to division were determined, and  also a basis was laid down for a document which outlines the  status of the base of the Russian Black Sea Fleet," Shmarov said.    In the opinion of one of the members of the Ukrainian  delegation "the progress at the negotiations was slow and one  might expect them to become more lively after the 26 June  presidential elections."    As presidential representative in Sevastopol Mykola Hlushko  said in an interview with UNIAN, uncertainty, as far as the  location of the Black Sea Fleet main base is concerned, hampers  the division of the coastal infrastructure. According to him,  the Russian side insisted that Sevastopol be selected as the  main base. The local authorities, remarked Hlushko, were more  inclined to agree with the proposal of the Ukrainian side: to  determine that the Black Sea Fleet main base should be not  Sevastopol as a whole, but that the base should be in the city  of Sevastopol, i.e. on its territory.    Hlushko emphasized that today only Ukraine renders financial  aid to Sevastopol: [word indistinct] to the value of 50 billion  karbovantsi were allocated by the government to maintain the  city, 33 billion karbovantsi of target aid were extended on a  nonrepayment basis to finish the construction of purification  systems at the Mezhgornyy water reservoir. On 8 June Sevastopol  received target credits to the value of 50 billion karbovantsi  (at the interest rate of 123 percent for a term of 40 days) to  purchase foods products.    Replying to a question from the UNIAN correspondent on  whether the city authorities would change their stand after the  26 June elections, Hlushko expressed his conviction that the  development of relations between Sevastopol and Kiev along other  ways is unrealistic.    The president's representative in Sevastopol mentioned the  sum Russia would have to pay for the possible rent of the land  and the immovable property of the Black Sea Fleet--2.5 trillion  [as received] karbovantsi per annum. This money would be  channelled to the city budget exclusively. Hlushko believes  that a separate agreement between the governments of Ukraine,  Russia, and Crimea with the participation of Sevastopol should  stipulate the annual sum to be paid by Russia for the  development of the city's infrastructure.    In an exclusive interview with UNIAN, the Ukrainian Naval  Forces commander, Volodymyr Bezkorovaynyy, pointed out that at  the next round of negotiations attention would be paid to the  infrastructure only, because "the issue on the division of ships  and vessels has been solved." The vice admiral also emphasized  the importance of noninterference on the part of the destructive  forces at present, so that the "work done by the delegations  would not be accelerated artificially by rallies and provocative  statements."    Answering a question from UNIAN, the head of the Russian  delegation said that the sides are working on an agreement,  which could be signed at the top level (presumably, at the level  of prime ministers).    In the near future the negotiations will be continued by the  delegations in their present composition, possibly in Moscow,  although the Ukrainian side insists that they should be held  beyond the borders of Russia and Ukraine.</p>

			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Technology: Corporate computing seeks safe pair of hands - IT security after the Virgin affair When it emerged that British Airways employees had accessed Virgin Atlantic computer data to poach customers and analyse route profitability, it was not just the airline industry which was shocked. Virgin had contracted out its information technology work to British Airways in a typical example of the practice known as facilities management (FM). Since this kind of arrangement is increasingly common across many different industrial sectors, who else faces this sort of risk? FM involves a third party taking over a client's computing needs, with the user then left to carry on with his original business. The outside contractor can supply its own personnel, or inherit the IT staff from the client. Either way, the user is spared the chore of hunting down and retaining scarce computer professionals. The practice began in the 1980s when some large organisations felt they were being diverted from their main objectives as budgets and personnel were swallowed up in the rise of IT. Banks in particular saw the IT department grow in significance to a point where computing threatened to become a core business in itself. The rising cost of keeping up with technology and the sense that IT was acquiring a disproportionate importance within organisations demanded a practical solution. The services sector within the IT industry spotted an opportunity and was quick to supply it. FM was born. From the start, hiving off the human and technical headaches of running a large computer system was seen as a big step. How far could an outside contractor be trusted? The FM industry maintained the integrity of third parties was practically guaranteed. For an IT contractor to abuse confidentiality would be suicidal. The airline industry was one of the first to adopt FM in a big way, with many carriers contracting out the task of running computerised reservation systems (CRSs). It takes millions of lines of code and large mainframe computers to process passenger and load data. British Airways has acknowledged expertise in the CRS field, which is why Virgin Airlines stores booking and flight load data on the British Airways Booking System (Babs). Other airlines do the same. British Midland Airways has recently renewed its contract with Babs. But the Virgin affair forced BMA to study security closely. BMA demanded that BA chairman Sir Colin Marshall gave a written undertaking that client security would be respected. But BMA also opted for a more concrete policy. The most commercially sensitive passenger information is kept in off-line computer systems that cannot be accessed via Babs. This secure database can only be interrogated through BMA's terminals. Des Butler, manager of agency automation at BMA, explains: 'We've every confidence in the BA people we deal with, but you have to keep some things at a remove.' He adds that professional respect does not mean letting down one's guard in an infamously competitive sector. Banks were also quick to move into FM - as both suppliers and users of third-party IT services. Barclays Computer Operations (BCO) was spun off when its parent bank decided to cash in on its IT experience. Tony Tatton-Brown, senior sales manager at BCO, points out his company's banking background means confidentiality is to the fore. BCO's clients can expect the same level of security as Barclays' customers. And Tatton-Brown thinks that should apply to any user of FM services. 'Once you say you're in the service business, you simply cannot entertain the concept of ever looking at user data.' Barclays is also an FM customer. Olivetti has a Pounds 100m contract to manage computer and banking equipment right across Barclays' branch network. Barclays uses very few Olivetti systems. But in one move, it has replaced more than 200 maintenance contracts for vital technical support with one contractor. Olivetti handles the various equipment providers and Barclays gets on with banking. Other computer hardware makers are rushing to diversify into service provision. Unisys, for example, is exploiting years of experience building large banking systems to set up shop as a financial systems house. It already manages and maintains electronic branch equipment for the Trustee Savings Bank and won FM business worth Pounds 40m in 1992. Since Unysis and Olivetti are firmly rooted in the IT industry, they are hardly potential competitors of clients. But how worried should the FM world be about farming out responsibility for sensitive information? Electronic Data Systems (EDS) cut its teeth in FM and grew into a worldwide computer services empire. Alan Stevens, EDS UK marketing manager, believes FM contracts must leave no room for doubt. 'The crucial issue is that both the supplier and customer enter into an agreement that protects not only their interests but also covers ethics.' The Computer Services Association is the relevant industry body and its code of conduct is unequivocal in respect of FM suppliers. Proper security for clients is imperative. But industry bodies proliferate in the IT industry. Blue chip companies such as British Steel and Barclays Bank have joined the European Security Forum (ESF). They meet to swap information on security and British Airways is a participant. A somewhat embarrassed ESF suggests that Virgin failed to appreciate the true commercial value of data held on computer. In other words, do not rely on the honour of your IT contractors. Virgin is reviewing its exposure to third-party IT support. It might be unjust to apply Butler's suspicion across the world of FM, but Virgin discovered that computers can prove a soft underbelly.</p>

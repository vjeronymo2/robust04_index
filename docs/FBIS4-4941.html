			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ha Won from Tokyo] </F>   [Text] North Korea and China are stepping up bilateral  military cooperation, THE SANKEI SHIMBUN reported on 5 April,  quoting a Hong Kong-based U.S. Congressional source on Asian  affairs.    According to the paper, North Korea has developed long-range  missiles with modern technologies from China. China, in return,  is exporting missiles and other arms to the Middle East region  via North Korean ports.    The source said that the China North Industries Group and  Poly Technologies Incorporated are working in close military  cooperation with North Korea. Both manufacture and sell arms  and are directly controlled by the People's Liberation Army.  The source added that the bilateral relations of cooperation  between China and North Korea have been maintained for a long  period of time through these organs.    In particular, the China North Industries Group has recently  provided modern missile technology to North Korea, enabling it  to complete the development of long-range missiles, the paper  reported.    The paper pointed out that chances are very slim that China,  which accounts for 85 percent of major imported goods to North  Korea, will take part in practical sanctions against North  Korea, even if it abstains when the UN Security Council votes on  economic sanctions against North Korea.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following discussion is intended to address comments received relative to weekly examinations for hazardous conditions to the area of deepest penetration in rooms where no pillars have been recovered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is a common practice in the mining industry to develop rooms off of a set of advancing entries with the return-side rooms being mined on the advance and intake-side rooms being mined on retreat. Once each set of rooms is developed to the projected depth, mining is considered completed in that specific area. As each set of rooms is advanced, connections are normally made between the previously developed rooms and the set of rooms being advanced. The rooms are usually connected by crosscuts at the point of deepest penetration. Work in these rooms is discontinued as each set of rooms is completed, creating a worked-out area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters have raised questions concerning the extent of the examination required in these sets of rooms once they are completed. Also, comments have suggested that in this mining scenario, the area may not be considered worked out until the final set of intake-side rooms is completed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency considers rooms and sets of rooms where mining is completed to be worked-out areas. Therefore, a weekly examination for hazardous conditions by traveling to the area of deepest penetration of the rooms or set of rooms is required. The required examination includes measurements of oxygen and methane concentrations and tests to determine if the air is moving in its proper direction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the rooms are connected from the first set of return rooms to the point of deepest penetration of the return rooms with no barriers providing separation, and similarly connected on the intake side, travel around the periphery of the rooms to the area of deepest penetration and conducting the required air and methane tests will satisfy the requirements of the section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As provided in existing &sect;75.364(a)(1), an alternate method which provides effective evaluation of the area may be approved in the ventilation plan. However, approval of an alternate method in lieu of examination at the points of deepest penetration within a developed area would be unlikely unless the area were penetrated and ventilated by shafts, bleeder entries, or some other effective method of adequately evaluating ventilation of the area. Comments are specifically solicited on the issues discussed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It has been suggested to the Agency that the requirement to evaluate the effectiveness of bleeder systems under paragraph (a)(2)(iii) can be satisfied by simply traveling the bleeder entries. Since the purpose of traveling bleeder entries is to evaluate the effectiveness of the bleeder system, this cannot be accomplished by simply traveling the entries. It is inherent in the requirement that the entries be traveled that the examiner periodically stop at critical locations to make such tests and measurements as may be necessary to determine that the bleeder system is working effectively. It would serve no purpose to require that the entries be traveled without an evaluation of the system's effectiveness. Although the Agency believes that the rule accurately reflects this intent and is not proposing to change the standard at this time, comments are solicited on this issue. Specifically, the comments should address the need for specifying where tests and measurements should be made, the nature of these tests and measurements, and whether this information should be included in the ventilation plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (b) is proposed for revision to address conditions to be checked by the weekly examiner. Under the existing rule, the weekly examiner is required to examine for hazardous conditions. The preamble to the existing rule states the Agency's position that ``Most 'hazards' are violations of mandatory standards.'' As with the preshift examiner, requiring the weekly examiner to look for all violations could distract the examiner from the more important aspects of the examination. Nonetheless, the Agency feels there is merit in placing the examiner and the operator in a proactive rather than a reactive role in terms of identifying hazards. Consistent with proposed &sect;75.360(b), the Agency is proposing that, similar to the previous standard, the weekly examination include an examination for hazardous conditions as well as noncompliance with mandatory safety or health standards that could result in a hazardous condition. The preamble to the existing rule states the Agency's position that ``*&blank;*&blank;* most hazardous conditions in a mine would result from a violation of a safety or health standard.'' (57 FR 20897, May 15, 1992.) It further states that requiring the examiner to look for all violations could distract the examiner from the more important aspects of the examination . Upon reconsideration, the Agency is proposing that the weekly examination be expanded to include an examination for noncompliance with mandatory safety or health standards that could result in a hazardous condition, as well as other hazardous conditions. This proposal places the examiner and the operator in a proactive rather than a reactive role and therefore has the potential to enhance safety by identifying a condition before a hazard exists.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

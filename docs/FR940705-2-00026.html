App.), notice is hereby given that the Naval Research Advisory Committee will meet on July 18 through 22, and July 25 through 29, 1994, at the Naval Command, Control and Ocean Surveillance Center, Research, Development, Test and Evaluation Division, San Diego, California. The sessions on July 18 through 22, and July 25 through 28, 1994, will commence at 8:00 a.m. and terminate at 5:00 p.m.; and the session on July 29, 1994, will commence at 8:30 a.m. and terminate at 11:30 a.m. All sessions of these meetings will be closed to the public. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of these meetings is to discuss basic and advanced research. All sessions of the meetings will be devoted to briefings, discussions, and technical examination of information related to Naval research and development, and modeling and simulation technology. Premature public disclosure of this information would be likely to significantly frustrate implementation of proposed policy actions by the Department of the Navy. The information involved is specifically authorized by Executive Order to be withheld from the public if the agency determines it to be in their best interest. It therefore is <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  appropriate that all sessions of the meetings be closed to the <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  general public. The agency-protected information to be discussed is so inextricably intertwined with unclassified matters as to preclude opening any portion of these meetings. Accordingly, the Secretary of the Navy has determined in writing that the public interest requires that all sessions of these meetings be closed to the public because they will be concerned with matters listed in section 552b(c)(9)(B) of title 5, United States Code. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For further information concerning these meetings contact: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Captain M.

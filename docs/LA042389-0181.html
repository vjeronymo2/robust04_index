			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOSPICE CARE  </P> <P> Thank you for your editorial supporting the conclusions of the Orange County  Grand Jury report that recommends the establishment of hospice care in Orange  County. The need is immediate and will increase substantially over the next  decade. It now costs $150 per day per patient in a hospice facility, as opposed  to $1,200 per day in an intensive care hospital unit.  </P> <P> Our Hospice Orange County steering committee is building an organization to  fund and operate a facility that will provide quality, compassionate care for  terminally ill patients and give comfort and financial relief to their  families. We are now evaluating business plan proposals from Coopers &amp;  Lybrand, Ernst &amp; Whinney and a San Diego-based health care consulting firm.  United Way has provided an office for us, and we have obtained a California  Community Foundation Grant.  </P> <P> Our broad-based committee has benefited from the generous participation of  advisers, such as Corrine Bayley, vice president, St. Joseph Health System; Dr.  Rex Ehling, county health officer; Penny Weismuller, AIDS coordinator of the  county Health Care Agency, and many others knowledgeable in this field.  </P> <P> We appreciate the efforts of the grand jury and its human services committee  for bringing the critical issue of hospice care to the attention of the Board  of Supervisors.  </P> <P> DR. ROSS CONNER  </P> <P> SINDEE SMOLOWITZ  </P> <P> Co-Chairs  </P> <P> Hospice Orange County  </P> <P> Steering Committee  </P></p>

			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Equity Markets: Other markets FRANKFURT Thursday sees the last Bundesbank council meeting for a month. UBS says that after the welter of comments from the Bundesbank about the demotion of M3, it would seem that we are now in for a period of further cuts in repo rates, but in small steps, even with further progress in the wage round. UBS, however, does not expect any further cut in the discount rate until the end of April. Consensus estimates are for a 35 per cent fall in profits from BASF on Thursday and a 9 per cent decline from Bayer on Friday.

Hoare Govett says the company will be one of the major beneficiaries of dollar strength while the scope for recovery in earnings at FNS East (now renamed Edwards) and at Finast Ohio is significant. PARIS LVMH, the world's largest luxury goods group, reports on Thursday, and forecasts are for a 5 - 10 per cent decline in full-year net profit. BSN is seen posting a 5 per cent decline in 1993 net profit on the same day. Pinault-Printemps, the retail group which has triggered protests from minority investors with its all-share offer for full control of La Redoute, its mail order subsidiary, reports on Friday. Consensus estimates are for a 13 per cent decline in net profits. MILAN Parmalat, the diary products group whose shares slid at the end of last week after it said it would seek a mandate from shareholders to raise up to L500bn over the next five years through bonds and warrants, is in Edinburgh today and London tomorrow with presentations to analysts .

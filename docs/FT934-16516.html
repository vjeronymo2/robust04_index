			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Tests for video link may cost BT Pounds 75m BRITISH Telecommunications is proposing to test its video-on-demand entertainment service in as many as 250,000 homes next year. The experiment is expected to cost about Pounds 75m and would probably be conducted in rural areas such as Suffolk or Sussex. BT technologists believe pictures of VHS or Super VHS quality can be delivered down telephone lines to 90 per cent of the 23m homes connected to the BT network. The digitally compressed pictures which would go through a special decoder could go down the telephone wire at the same time as a conversation. If the experiment succeeds BT would go ahead with the investment of several billion pounds needed to create a national system. Recently the Independent Television Commission said it thought that a video-on-demand service would not need a special licence under broadcasting legislation. BT envisages a system where a menu is produced on a television screen and viewers are able to call up the movie or programme of their choice. Cable TV, Separate Section</p>

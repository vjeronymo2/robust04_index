			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Lopex makes Pounds 3.5m cash call to repay debt LOPEX, the communications group, is to raise Pounds 3.5m in a 1-for-1 rights issue to repay debt. The issue is priced at 17p per share and will allow Lopex to pay off its estimated Pounds 3.5m debt. Its shares closed yesterday at 24p, down 1p. Lopex, struggling in the beleaguered advertising sector, incurred pre-tax losses of Pounds 125,000 in the first half of 1992, after losses of Pounds 398,000 for the whole of 1991. It is however, projecting profits of Pounds 200,000 for the year ending December 1992, but no final dividend. Mr Barrie Warman, finance director, said: 'Our clients have been looking at us with a bit of a jaundiced eye. Our main problem is with TV companies, which have very strict balance sheet criteria.' The issue is underwritten by Kleinwort Benson. It is being accompanied by the establishment of an employee trust, to be endowed with Pounds 1.2m of unpaid performance bonuses, which will subscribe to the new shares and sub-underwrite about a third of the issue. 'We want to see the cash transferred to the trust reinvested in the group, enlarging Lopex's equity base,' said Mr Warman. Most of the group's revenue comes from the depressed UK market. Its public relations and direct mailing side has fared far better than advertising.</p>

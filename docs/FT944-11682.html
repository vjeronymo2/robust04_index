			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / International Company News: Report casts doubt on control of markets As the international capital market becomes more integrated it is becoming impossible for even the biggest governments to control their own financial markets, claims a report by the McKinsey Global Institute, published today. 'Market forces are proving to be irresistible,' says the report produced over the last year by McKinsey's financial institutions group. It says that 'the challenge for policymakers, whether or not they like the growing power of the global capital market, is to learn to work with the market rather than resist or control it'. It warns that failure to tackle fiscal problems by a number of developed countries could result in 'unsustainable levels of indebtedness'. The report highlights four driving forces behind globalisation of markets: liberalisation of regulation; the increased quality and availability of information and infrastructure (and the ease with which the technology can be transferred worldwide); the securitisation of the flow of funds; and the growing use of derivatives. It says that the size of the market tripled between 1980 and 1992, reaching an estimated Dollars 35,000bn in 1992. It could reach Dollars 53,000bn in real terms by the end of the decade, an amount equivalent to three times the size of the gross domestic product of the developed countries and 19 times the size of their exports. The report predicts that market rather than government activity will determine prices in all main markets, with a global approach to the relationship between risk and return extending beyond bonds into equities. The internationalisation of the commodity and bond markets which began in the 1970s and 1980s has already begun in the equity markets, evidenced by the recent rise in international issuance. The report is optimistic about the developed world's capacity to generate savings, which it expects to increase sharply over the next two decades as a result of demographic factors. These resources can be channelled to the investment opportunities offered by the developing world, but only if governments adopt the right policies. 'On balance, if policy-makers can adjust to a global framework in developing policy, we see far more potential for benefit than harm from a mature global capital market.'

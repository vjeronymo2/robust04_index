			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / US quits base in Philippines today US personnel pull out today from the Philippines' Subic Naval Base, the largest American overseas military facility, as part of a process that puts an end to a 45-year military presence. Washington originally occupied the country in 1898 as a colony. At its busiest in the late 1980s Subic, which served as repair and supply centre for the US Seventh Fleet, was home to more than 6,000 staff and troops and their 5,000 or so dependents. A year ago the Philippine Senate voted down an administration-sponsored treaty that would have extended the bases' stay by another 10 years. American spending from the bases represented about 5 per cent of annual Philippine gross national product, but some argued that it distorted growth. The remaining 1,000 base staff are moving to Cubi Point, an adjacent naval air station where the final goodbyes are due in November. An agency formed by Philippine civilian and military officials will now operate the Subic facility. The Philippines continues to have a mutual defence treaty with Washington, and Mr Richard Solomon, the new American ambassador to Manila, said yesterday that the US was ready to work out a new arrangement which could include joint military training and intelligence gathering. The physical infrastructure facilities in the 55,000 acre Subic site are, meanwhile, attracting investors from Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea and Hong Kong. Its deep harbour and airstrip offer easy transport. It has its own electric power generator that could shield industries from the pernicious power cuts in Manila. A Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority has been created to oversee the transformation of the base area into an industrial enclave. Taiwanese investors appear to be the keenest. They are proposing long-term leases on select sites in the facility which they want to convert into a transshipment port and storage area similar to Kaoh-shiung in southern Taiwan. Singapore's Keppel Corporation wants to set up a ship-repair yard. South Koreans are also looking at possible locations for light industries, and there are signs of interest from large Japanese trading houses.</p>

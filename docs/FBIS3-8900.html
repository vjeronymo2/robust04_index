			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Robert Jakubowski: "London Taken"] </F>   [Text] After four years of talks, Poland has at last  concluded a deal on a reduction of the debts it owes to  commercial banks in the London Club. We still have to pay more  than half of the $13-billion debt, but most of it does not have  to be paid for several years' time.    Polish negotiators reached agreement with the commercial  banks in Frankfurt on the night of Thursday to Friday [10-11  March]. The chief of the Polish delegation, Krzysztof Krowacki,  says that the entire Polish debt (including interest) will be  reduced by 45.2 percent. Poland will purchase a part of the  debt this year, but at a low price. The remainder will be  converted into bonds with a term of 20 or 30 years.    During the four years of talks, Poland kept saying it wanted  a 50-percent reduction in its debts, the same percentage waived  by the Paris Club of commercial banks in 1990. But, over the  past year, Krowacki spoke only of the "relativity" of the  conditions necessary for a reduction.    Our negotiators were not so much concerned with the size of  the reduction. Of greater concern was that Poland should not  repay too much, at least not in the beginning. For the time  being, we are not going to pay more than $400 million per year  and, after five years, not more than $0.5 billion.    Following the news of the agreement, the price of the Polish  debt on secondary markets fell from 46 to 41.5 cents. "If the  price had risen, it woid have meant that the deal was a success  for the banks," joked Krowacki. The dealers handling the Polish  debt also explained the fallen price by the fact that Poland  will repay its creditors less than expected, and much later than  expected.    Prime Minister Pawlak said that the rapid and favorable  agreement is largely attributable to the German banks.    "The Germans have the strongest links to the Polish economy,  and that is why they wanted to see this deal concluded as  quickly as possible," says James Lister-Cheese of the U.S.  Morgan Stanley investment bank.    "The signing of the agreement means that, as of 1995, we are  going to service our debts fully. In this way, our financial  relations with the West will undergo a complete normalization,"  says Finance Minister Henryk Chmielak.    Banks and other financial institutions will be all the more  willing to give us loans, and foreign investors will have more  courage to enter Poland if the banks that finance them stop  treating Poland as a high risk.    The conclusion of the agreement with the London Club was  also  one of the conditions imposed on us by the IMF and the World  Bank.</p>

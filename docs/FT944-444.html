			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / Clinton suffers new setback as director of CIA resigns President Bill Clinton last night suffered the loss of another senior member of his administration when he accepted 'with regret' the resignation of Mr James Woolsey, director of the Central Intelligence Agency. In a brief White House statement, Mr Clinton commended Mr Woolsey for 'having advanced the transformation of US intelligence in the aftermath of the Cold War'. Mr Woolsey, sailing in the Caribbean with his wife and three sons, offered no reason for his resignation, conveyed to the president at the weekend, other than family considerations. His departure was not a complete surprise in Washington. It was no secret that he was unhappy over relations with a White House largely uninterested in intelligence matters, though Mr Woolsey did not make a habit of complaining in public. He also came under heavy fire in Congress for failing to discipline senior CIA officers severely over Aldrich Ames - the spy for the Soviets sentenced to life imprisonment this year for having betrayed US covert operations. A sexual harassment case settled in favour of a woman CIA officer further damaged the agency's reputation. Mr Woolsey is the third Cabinet-level member of the administration to leave in the past two months. Mr Lloyd Bentsen resigned as treasury secretary this month and will be replaced by Mr Robert Rubin, head of the White House national economic council. Earlier yesterday, Mr Clinton named Mr Dan Glickman as agriculture secretary to succeed Mr Mike Espy, who resigned under an ethical cloud. Mr Glickman, a Democratic former congressman from Kansas and a leading member of the House intelligence committee, had been mentioned as a replacement for Mr Woolsey. Mr John Deutch, deputy secretary of defence, and Mr Morton Abramowicz, a former diplomat who runs the Carnegie Endowment think-tank in Washington, now head most possible short-lists for the CIA post. But there may be reluctance to break up the successful team at the Pentagon under Mr William Perry, defence secretary, while Mr Abramowicz's criticisms of US policy on Bosnia have not endeared him to the White House. Retiring members of Congress, possibly including some Republicans, may be considered, but several Democrats have blotted their copybooks. Mr Dave McCurdy of Oklahoma, for example, who lobbied for the CIA position before it went to Mr Woolsey, recently described Mr Clinton as 'a transitional figure'. No date for the announcement of a successor has been set. Sex trial reprieve for Clinton, Page 2</p>

			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Arts: Lisbon looks to its cultural laurels - But Richard Fairman feels that the real Portugal lurks elsewhere The European cultural roundabout has almost finished its first spin. The honour of being Europe's cultural capital city is being rotated year by year among the member countries and there are only a couple left to go, although the four new members who join in 1995 could prolong the scheme. This year it is the turn of Lisbon. With the examples of the cities who have gone before, Lisbon has planned a wide-ranging programme of events. One of the ways of making sure that the benefits are not all spent in the course of one year is to put investment into capital projects. Glasgow, for example, built the Royal Concert Hall and Lisbon has followed suit by refurbishing the Coliseu, which is used for the city's most prestigious concerts. Another is to delve back into the city's cultural history. This is to mine a rich vein in Lisbon. In a gallery at the National Museum of Archaeology, part of the mightily imposing Hyeronimite Monastery at Belem just outside central Lisbon, an exhibition called Subterranean Lisbon follows the history of the various civilisations that have settled in the area up to the earthquake and fire of 1755, which devastated so much of the city. As far as the performing arts are concerned, a cultural capital only derives lasting benefit from its year in the spotlight if it can use some of the money being made available to encourage home-grown performers. A number of smaller Portuguese groups have won a hand-out from Lisbon 94 to put towards new work, which should raise the output of cultural activity even if it cannot be guaranteed to raise the standard. Modern dance is apt to be a hit-or-miss affair. At the Teatro Sao Luis two choreographers - Francisco Camacho and Vera Mantero - presented a joint programme of new dance events early in April. The first involved three women with multi-faceted talents. One ironed her dress while she was still wearing it. Another fondled a head of Medusa. The third poured water into her right ear from an oil-can. All three stood stock still for about half an hour. Maybe I am old-fashioned, but I always thought dance involved movement of some kind, even if it was only the occasional pirouette. The Edinburgh fringe beckons. A visit to the opera is likely to be a safer bet. Unlike Spain, which produces a stream of world-class opera singers, Portugal has not imposed itself on the international operatic scene to an equivalent degree. Nevertheless, it does have the Teatro Sao Carlos, which is worth a visit on its own account. In the 18th century Lisbon briefly enjoyed the most splendid opera-house in Europe, which opened in March 1775 and was destroyed by the earthquake a few months later. The Sao Carlos, inaugurated in 1793, replaced it, beautiful, simple but elegant. Callas famously sang La traviata there in the 1950s, but the challenge now is to encourage more indigenous talent. The new production of Beethoven's Fidelio was sung mostly by visiting foreign singers, but produced and designed by a Portuguese team. By and large they did themselves credit. According to the libretto, the opera is set next door in Spain, as was customary at the time for any difficult political subject, but few productions interest themselves any more in identifying a particular locale (unless it be Nazi Germany). The producer Paulo Ferreira de Castro and designers Manuel Graca Dias and Egas Jose Vieira contented themselves with an unspecified modern location. Guards wielding rifles formed an ominous presence. Searchlights periodically scanned the auditorium. Most of the action was par for the course, but the producer has an eye for a coup de theatre. At the end, pages of Beethoven's score floated down from the ceiling, while the chorus appeared among the audience in boxes on the upper tiers - a splendid conclusion, as their singing raised the roof from there. There were two strong voices in the main roles: Nadine Secunde as Leonore and Jan Blinkhof as Florestan. John Macurdy was a laid-back Rocco. Elvira Ferreira (evidently a local favourite) and Gunnar Gudbjornsson were an acceptable Marzelline and Jacquino. Bodo Brinkmann's blustering Pizarro was upstaged in his aria by the prison alsations, which let out a ferocious din as he strode to the front of the stage to start singing - a hair-raising effect. The conductor Thomas Fulton was at his best in the noise and energy of the final scene. Yet, after all this, the suspicion remains that real Portuguese culture is lurking elsewhere. Lunch at a small restaurant off the beaten track was interrupted by the arrival of a lottery-ticket salesman, who introduced his wares in the traditional fashion - with a fado, to the untutored ear a cross between folk singing and a quiet yodel. 'You can't learn fado', our Portuguese guide observed, 'you have to be born with it'. Perhaps that is the secret of an indigenous culture in any country.</p>

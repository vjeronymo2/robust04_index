			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Funds act over pensions - After Maxwell, many are making reforms IF YOU belong to an occupational pension scheme, you could have cause to be grateful to the dead tycoon Robert Maxwell. Because of the way he raided the pension funds of his various companies, the UK government set up a wide-ranging review of the sector. Legislation, aimed at making pensions more secure and providing some kind of compensation should the safeguards fail, is expected in the 1994/95 parliamentary session. There is evidence, however, that pension schemes are prepared to put their own houses in order. A survey of 170 by Pensions Management magazine shows many have reviewed their procedures and about one-third have made changes. Most of these are concerned with tightening security procedures when money is moved; for example, when assets are bought and sold. It was laxity in this area which allowed Maxwell to siphon off huge sums from his companies' pension schemes. The way Maxwell dominated the trustees of his schemes also was central to the thefts, and a significant number of the funds surveyed have reviewed their arrangements. Some have removed senior directors as trustees; others have appointed new trustees from the work force, or have employed a professional, independent trustee. If you belong to a pension scheme, you might not know that changes of this kind have been made. As John Cunliffe, a pension lawyer with McKenna &amp; Co, explains: 'Although schemes will usually want to publicise the fact that they have made improvements, there is a contrary view which says, 'If we have a well-run scheme, we don't want to alarm members by telling them we have found it necessary to tighten our procedures'.' Most schemes, however, do want everyone to know what is going on. The Pensions Management survey shows that, after the Maxwell scandal, almost 90 per cent have made efforts to re-assure members that their money is safe. But what should you do if you belong to one of the others? When you join an occupational pension scheme, you have an automatic right to details of its operation. This includes conditions of membership, how contributions are calculated, the benefits payable, the trustees' annual report, the trust deed and rules, and the latest actuarial valuation. A contact address for further information must also be given. The problem is that much of this information is not written with the average scheme member in mind. So, once you have it, you probably will not know what to do with it. And while there is no neat solution, Don Hall, of the Occupational Pensions Advisory Service (OPAS), says there are some warning signs for which members can look out. One is the failure of a scheme to provide information. Hall says disclosure problems have figured in most of the serious cases with which OPAS has dealt. Many workers are concerned because their employers are taking contribution 'holidays.' This in itself should not be a problem, but check your trustees' annual report if you are worried. This must tell you if there is a discrepancy between the contributions paid to the scheme and the amount recommended by the actuary. If there is, you could have cause for anxiety. The annual report also will show if your pension fund invests in your employing company. You might have grounds for worry if the level of self-investment has increased greatly since the last report. Hall says the best advice he can give scheme members is to take an active interest and ask lots of questions. How is the scheme invested? Who are the actuaries? Are benefits paid promptly? If you are concerned about some aspect of your scheme, your queries should go first to the trustees. In most cases, they should be able to put your mind at rest. If they cannot, you should contact OPAS; it has no statutory power but its experienced advisers will be able to assess your complaint and suggest ways to pursue it. Ultimately, the only course of action could be for the member to leave the scheme and transfer his benefits. 'It is very sad if it should come to this because most schemes give their members a very good deal,' says Cunliffe. 'But, with hindsight, Maxwell pensioners would have done well to transfer out of their schemes.' OPAS, 11 Belgrave Road, London SWlV IRS. Tel: 071-233-8080.</p>

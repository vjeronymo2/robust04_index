			<p><P> December 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OREGON STATE FALLS, 117-113, TO KIMBLE'S 53  </P> <P> In a shootout between local favorite Gary Payton and Loyola Marymount's Bo  Kimble, the Lions beat 21st-ranked Oregon State Tuesday night, 117-113.  </P> <P> A crowd of 9,183 saw Gill Coliseum -- which began the evening as Payton's Place  -- end up as Kimble's Corner.  </P> <P> The Beaver All-American fouled out with 48 points. His fifth foul provided  Kimble with the last of his 53 points and allowed Loyola to build a three-point  lead in the final minute.  </P> <P> Payton's total tied Mel Counts' 26-year-old school record, while Kimble's total  -- his third in a row of more than 50 -- broke the record for an Oregon State  opponent of 46 set by Louisiana State's Pete Maravich in 1969. It was also a  Loyola school record. Kimble hit 21 of 27 shots from the field, 10 of 11 free  throws and added a game-high 12 rebounds in the absence of Hank Gathers.  Loyola's total was the most ever scored against Oregon State.  </P> <P> In Loyola's first victory over a ranked team since beating Wyoming in the NCAA  tournament in March, 1988, the Lions overcame several double-figure deficits.  </P> <P> When Payton opened the second-half scoring, the Beavers led, 68-58. But Loyola  stormed back when Per Stumer hit two three-pointers, and Jeff Fryer connected  on five more. The Lions, who shot 59% (to Oregon State's 58.5%) hit 10 of 20  three-point attempts. The Beavers hit only one.  </P> <P> Loyola took its first lead since the opening minute at 71-70 but didn't go  ahead for good until the 59-second mark, when, with the score tied at 112-112,  Kimble drove into the lane, drew contact from Payton and sank the shot. Payton  was called for the foul, and Kimble completed the three-point play.  </P> <P> "I just told our guys I was disappointed we didn't get our (scoring) average,"  Lion Coach Paul Westhead quipped. "I knew we were all right when we got down  12, but two minutes later it was back to four. Once the game gets going like  that, we're in good shape. Sometimes we give so much you get caught up in the  run."  </P> <P> Oregon State Coach Jim Anderson agreed. "The system got to us," he said.  </P> <P> In improving to 6-1, Loyola got 22 points from Fryer and 18 from Terrell  Lowery. Four players from Oregon State (5-2) supported Payton with double  figures.  </P> <P> Among its accomplishments Tuesday, Loyola was able to force 19 turnovers. The  Beavers were averaging only 12.  </P> <P> "I don't usually brag about our defense, but we were very tough," Westhead  said. "We played our press very well. It was evident we had tired Oregon State  in the first half."  </P> <P> The fast-paced first half rapidly became a duel between Payton and Kimble, who  scored 28 apiece by halftime. Payton paced the Beavers to a 12-point lead  midway through the period and had 18 points nine minutes into the game.  </P> <P> Then Kimble began working inside, and Loyola trimmed the lead to 52-50 with two  minutes left in the half.  </P> <P> When Kimble left with three fouls, the Beavers followed with a 10-0 spurt and  appeared close to burying Loyola before the half. Kimble quickly re-entered the  game and responded with two consecutive baskets. Then Lowery hit a spinning  drive at the buzzer to cut the halftime lead to 66-58.  </P> <P> Once the Lions caught up down the stretch, the margin in the final six minutes  was never more than two points until Kimble's clinching basket.  </P> <P> "The great thing was it wasn't like we just stopped the show and said get the  ball to Bo," Westhead said. "Eighty-five percent (of his scoring) was in the  flow."  </P> <P> Said Anderson: "Kimble was an unstoppable force."  </P></p>

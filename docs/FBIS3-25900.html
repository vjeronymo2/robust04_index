			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Li Desheng (2621 1795 3932): "From the Lushan Meeting </F> to the 13 September Incident"]    [Text] Beginning in 1969, I worked under the direct  leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong for more than four years, and  this was the most unforgettable experience of my life.    In this article I am going to narrate some historical facts  I  personally witnessed in the struggle led by Comrade Mao Zedong  against the Lin Biao Counterrevolutionary Clique in  commemoration of that great person.    In July 1969 the party central leadership decided to  transfer  me to work in Beijing. At that time I was an alternate member  of the Central Committee's Political Bureau. At first I was  appointed to work in the Routine Work Group [ye wu zu 2814 0523  4809] of the State Council and in the Executive Group [ban shi  zu 6586 0057 4809] of the Central Military Commission. I was  concurrently first secretary of the Anhui Provincial CPC  Committee. Sometime later I was also appointed to be director  of the General Political Department of the People's Liberation  Army.    In August 1970, on the eve of the Second Plenary Session of  the Ninth CPC Central Committee, I went to Anhui's Huaibei area,  where production remained in a backward condition, to conduct  investigations and studies for nearly a month. There, I  received the meeting notice and directly went to Lushan from  Anhui.    The Second Plenary Session of the Ninth CPC Central  Committee  opened on 23 August 1970. Chairman Mao presided over that day's  meeting, and Premier Zhou announced the three subjects on the  plenum's agenda, namely, the revision of the PRC Constitution,  the formulation of the national economic plan, and the issue of  war preparations.    According to the announced agenda, Kang Sheng should deliver  a report on the draft of the Constitution, but at this moment,  Lin Biao spoke. Although the agenda announced by Premier Zhou  did not list Lin Biao's speech, as Lin was then vice chairman of  the party Central Committee, it was regarded as normal if he  spoke ahead of Kang Sheng. In his speech, Lin Biao talked a lot  about Chairman Mao's genius. He said: "Chairman Mao's status  of being a great leader, head of state, and supreme commander"  is a "feature" of the new Constitution. Such a leading position  "must be recognized by all people except some extremely  counterrevolutionaries at home and abroad." That evening after  Lin Biao's speech, at the meeting of the Political Bureau to  discuss the outline of the national economic plan, Wu Faxian  suddenly proposed that people attending the plenum of the  Central Committee the next day listen to the recording of Lin  Biao's speech and discuss this speech. The plenum thus made  such an arrangement.    The next day problems arose in the discussions of various  groups. People who had ganged up around Lin Biao spoke  separately in the north China group, the central and south China  group, the southwest China group, and the northwest China group  to express the same opinions according to the arrangements made  by Ye Qun beforehand. They all advocated the theory of genius  and insisted on setting the post of state president and electing  Chairman Mao to be state president.    Before that, Chairman Mao had officially proposed that no  state presidency be set, and this had also been discussed and  approved by the Political Bureau. So comrades in the Political  Bureau were all aware of this. It was impossible that Lin Biao  was unaware of this. However, why did he mention this again at  the plenum?    In order to support this action, Chen Boda and Ye Qun had  long made preparations. After going up to Lushan, they hastily  collected some quotations. After Chen Boda's selection, they  compiled a document entitled "Some Quotations of Engels, Lenin,  and Chairman Mao on Genius" overnight and then distributed it to  some people. The day after Lin Biao spoke, in addition to the  several generals commanded by Ye Qun, Chen Boda also made a  speech in the north China group. He even said: "A very small  number of people even denounced the thesis that Comrade Mao  Zedong has comprehensively defended and developed  Marxism-Leninism in a talented and creative way as an "irony.'"  "Some people tried to use Chairman Mao's greatness and modesty  to belittle Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought." "Some  counterrevolutionaries were very glad to hear that Chairman Mao  would not be state president, and they even danced for joy!" In  order to act as quickly as possible to support Lin Biao, he  distributed his speech in the north China group's second  briefing on the morning of 25 August. As Lin Biao was vice  chairman of the party, many people thought that Lin's speech was  endorsed by Chairman Mao, and as Chen Boda was a member of the  Standing Committee of the Political Bureau, his speech was also  rather weighty. The distribution of the briefing changed the  atmosphere of the plenum. People discussed it inside and  outside the meetings and the agenda was completely disrupted.  The intensification of the contradictions forced Chairman Mao  to personally make a ruling.    What was to be done at the next step at the plenum? People  were deeply concerned.    On the afternoon of 25 August, the Standing Committee of the  Political Bureau held an enlarged meeting which was attended by  all group leaders. Chairman Mao took a resolute action and  announced three instructions at the meeting.    First, the plenum should be adjourned immediately, and the  discussion on Lin Biao's speech at the opening meeting should be  stopped. Second, the north China group's second briefing should  be retrieved. Third, no people should be purged, and unity  should be kept according to the spirit of the ninth party  congress, because Chen Boda's speech in the north China group  violated the guideline laid down by the ninth party congress.  Chairman Mao then sternly said: If you continue to act in this  way, I will leave Lushan and you may continue to stir up trouble  as you like. No one should continue to mention the issue of  setting up a state presidency. Those who insist on setting up a  state presidency may take the post themselves. Anyway, I will  never be state president! He also told Lin Biao: I advise you  not to take the state presidency as well, and those who insist  on setting such a post should take it themselves!    Several days after that, Premier Zhou relayed Chairman Mao's  instruction to me: I should return to Beijing to take charge of  the work of the Executive Group of the Central Military  Commission so that Huang Yongsheng could go to Lushang and  attend the meeting. Comrade Li Xiannian also returned to Beijing  to replace Comrade Ji Dengkui so he could attend the meeting at  Lushan.    After returning to Beijing, I was not quite clear about the  happenings at the plenum, and I was told later about what  happened there. On 1 September Chairman Mao wrote "My Opinion"  at Lushan, and the writing was sent to Beijing. I carefully read  it many times. Chairman Mao's essay pointed out the nature of  the event and openly criticized Chen Boda, but it still  "protected" Lin Biao and left an opportunity for him to correct  his mistakes.    On 16 December, according to Chairman Mao's opinion, the  Political Bureau decided to hold the North China conference to  further expose Chen Boda's mistakes. The conference lasted from  22 December 1970 to 24 January 1971. At the conference, on  behalf of the party central leadership, Premier Zhou  systematically exposed Chen Boda's crimes and announced the  party Central Committee's decision on reorganizing the leading  body of the Beijing Military Region. I was appointed to be  commander of the Beijing Military Region, and Ji Dengkui was  appointed to be its political commissar. Before the announcement  of my new appointment, Chairman Mao personally talked with me.    On the basis of the north China conference, the central  leadership prepared another report meeting to criticize Chen and  party rectification. Premier Zhou led me and Huang Yongsheng,  Wu Faxian, Li Zuopeng, and Qiu Huizuo to see Lin Biao in  Beidaihe. Premier Zhou told me the purpose of our trip was to  relay Chairman Mao's opinion on telling Lin Biao to attend the  forthcoming report meeting criticizing Chen and party  rectification. We were going to say something so that he might  act in a face-saving way.    When we met with Lin Biao in Beidaihe, he only told Huang,  Wu, Li, Qiu to make self-criticism, but he himself still refused  to admit his own mistake and did not express his willingness to  attend the meeting.    After returning from Beidaihe, Premier Zhou again took us to  see Chairman Mao, and reported what happened in Beidaihe to the  chairman. After listening to our report, Chairman Mao sternly  criticized Huang, Wu, Li, and Qiu to their faces: "You have  moved to the brink of the precipice! Are you going to jump or  be pushed down the precipice? Or are you willing to be pulled  back? All will depend on yourselves!" Chairman Mao was also  unsatisfied with Lin Biao's attitude, but he did not say  anything before Huang, Wu, Li, and Qiu.    In the campaign of criticizing Chen Boda and rectifying the  party's style, Chairman Mao read a large quantity of materials  and found that the activities of Lin Biao and company were  extremely suspicious. He decided to make an inspection tour to  the south in order to further find out the facts and to make  some preparations for the convention of the forthcoming Third  Plenary Session of the Ninth CPC Central Committee.    On 14 August 1971 Chairman Mao left Beijing and started his  inspection tour to the south. He first arrived in Wuhan, and  then went to Changsha, Nanchang, and Hangzhou. In his journey  he met with local party, government, and military leaders, and  mainly talked with them about the struggle beginning from the  Lushan meeting in 1970. He pointed out: "At the Lushan  meeting, they launched a sudden attack and carried out  underground activities. Why did they not dare to act openly?  Because they had a guilty conscience. Their sudden attack and  underground activities were all conducted in an organized and  planned way according to a certain guideline, and the guideline  was to set the state presidency and to advocate `genius' for the  purpose of opposing the line laid down by the ninth party  congress and to overturn the three-point agenda for the Second  Plenary Session of the Ninth CPC Central Committee. A certain  person was anxious to become state president, and tried to split  the party and to usurp the power." "Comrade Lin Biao did not  consult me before he made his speech, and he did not let me read  his script beforehand." He added: "This time, Vice Chairman  Lin should still be protected, and no conclusion was made on  blaming him. Of course, he should still bear certain  responsibility. What should be done to other people involved?  Our principle remains one for educating the erring people.  That is, `learning from past mistakes to avoid future ones, and  cure the sickness to save the patient.'"    After arriving in Nanchang on 31 August, Chairman Mao was  told that Zhou Yuchi, a backbone member of Lin Biao's clique,  transported an amphibious vehicle away from Jiangxi by plane.  This aroused his vigilance. On 3 September, he left Nanchang  for Hangzhou.    When talking with local responsible comrades on the journey,  Chairman Mao repeatedly stressed that his words must not be  revealed to other people who were not present. However, on 5  September, when Li Zuopeng accompanied foreign visitors to  Wuhan, Liu Feng revealed Chairman Mao's words to Li. The next  day, as soon as he returned to Beijing, Li passed the message to  Huang Yongsheng and Qiu Huizuo. Huang told Ye Qun on the  telephone. Late on the evening of 5 September Lin Biao's  underlings in Guangzhou secretly reported the contents of  Chairman Mao's talk to Beijing's Yu Xinye, who took 15 pages of  notes. On 6 September Yu personally flew a helicopter to  Beidaihe and delivered the notes of the telephone report to Lin  Biao, Ye Qun, and Lin Liguo. The information from the two  difference sources shocked Lin Biao and company like a bolt from  the blue. Being startled, they decided to lay murderous hands  on Chairman Mao.    On 8 September, Lin Biao personally wrote an order with a  red  pencil: "Act according to the order relayed by Comrade Liguo  and Comrade Yuchi." At the same time, Ye Qun wrote a  confidential letter to be personally opened by Huang Yongsheng:  "The current situation is critical. We have decided to take  action in Shanghai." When the criminals were tried later, they  confessed that Lin Liguo and his accomplices worked out three  methods of assassinating Chairman Mao: First, to use  flamethrowers and bazookas to attack the train carrying Chairman  Mao; second, to use 100-mm antiaircraft guns against the train;  third, to order Wang Weiguo, political commissar of the Fourth  Air Force Army in Shanghai, to carry a pistol in to see Chairman  Mao on the train and take action during the meeting.    After coming to Hangzhou, Chairman Mao had the train moved  to  Shaoxing. On 10 September, Chairman Mao suddenly decided to set  off in the afternoon without asking any local people to see him  off. More than three hours later, the train arrived in Shanghai.  He did not leave the train; instead, he told his assistants to  telephone Xu Shiyou and summon him to Shanghai. The next  morning, the chairman talked with Xu Shiyou and Wang Hongwen on  the train. After the talk, he asked Wang Hongwen to lead Xu  Shiyou to the Jinjiang Hotel and have lunch there. As soon as  Wang Dongxing returned from seeing them off, Chairman Mao told  him: "We should depart now, and no need to notify them. The  train should go now, and nobody should be notified. Let the  vanguard train move first."    From 8 to 11 September, Lin Liguo, Zhou Yuchi, and other  accomplices gathered in a small bungalow of Beijing's Xijiao  Airport, and continued to plan the assassination of Chairman  Mao. Some of them proposed setting fire to Shanghai's Hongqiao  Airport and taking advantage of the chaotic condition to kill  the chairman. Some of them proposed the use of flamethrowers to  burn the chairman to death, some people proposed using military  planes to drop bombs, and another option was to lay explosives  on the Suofang Bridge near Suzhou to blow up the  train....However, before they had enough time to carry out the  bridge explosion plan, Chairman Mao's special train had safely  passed the bridge and sped northward without stopping. The train  passed Bangbu, Jinan, and Tianjin. Then Chairman Mao ordered  the train to stop, and told Zhang Yaoci to telephone Li Desheng,  Ji Dengkui, Wu De, and Wu Zhong, and summon them to the Fengtai  Railway Station.    At 12 o'clock on 12 September 1971 we met with Chairman Mao  in his special train in the Fengtai Railway Station. Comrade  Wang Dongxing was also present. Although the chairman was  somewhat tired after returning from the long journey to the  south and was considering the struggle against Lin Biao and his  company, he was still in a good mood and still talked in a  humorous way. He said: "They launched a sudden attack on  Lushan, and even tried to blast the mountain to pieces and stop  the rotation of the earth....The issue of genius is a  theoretical issue, and they held a viewpoint of idealism on this  issue....A genius is just a bit cleverer, and a genius still  must follow the mass line and rely on collective wisdom....What  nonsense, talking about the peak and saying that each sentence I  said could match 10,000 sentences other people said....I  mentioned six times that there is no need to set up a state  presidency. If one sentence could match 10,000 sentences, then  there were 60,000 sentences. However, he still did not hear  even half a sentence. There was no effect at all." Then  Chairman Mao faced me and said: "You may ask them about the  materials they distributed in Lushan, and may ask them three  times a year: 'Why didn't you give me your treasured object?'  And see what they would say!" Chairman Mao referred to the  fact that they did not deliver the collection of quotations on  "genius" they compiled in Lushan. At a meeting I mentioned this,  and at that time Chairman Mao said: "You should ask them to give  it to you!" After that, he always remembered this. Then,  Chairman Mao added: "Chen Boda was not the only evil backstage  manipulator [hei shou 7815 2087], there was still someone else."  This remark hinted Lin Biao.    Finally, Chairman Mao told me to carry out a task:  Transferring one division of troops to Nankou. At that moment,  Chairman Mao was not only alert, but also began to make concrete  arrangements because he had expected the worst possibility that  Lin Biao and his company might stage an armed coup d'etat.  After saying goodbye to the chairman, I immediately arranged  the transfer of one division.    I did not expect a serious incident to occur that very  night.    On the evening of 12 September I attended a meeting at the  Great Hall of the People. The meeting was chaired by Premier  Zhou, and the subject of discussion was the government work  report to be delivered to the forthcoming session of the Fourth  National People's Congress.    After 2200, the security guards in Beidaihe directly  telephoned the premier, saying that Lin Biao, Ye Qun, and Lin  Liguo would leave Shanhaiguan by plane, and the departure time  would be 0600 the next morning (13 September) and the  destination would be Guangzhou. Belonging to the same clique,  Huang Yongsheng, Wu Faxian, Li Zuopeng, and Qiu Huizuo also  planned to set off from Beijing at the same time the next  morning. The premier paid close attention to the development of  events, and felt that the developments went beyond his  expectations. He frowned and told the guards to closely watch  the happenings and report them to him at any time. Then, the  premier immediately asked Wu Faxian why a Trident flew to  Shanhaiguan, and ordered that the plane fly back immediately  without taking any people back to Beijing. Wu Faxian spoke  evasively and told a lie to the premier, saying that the plane  was carrying out the task of night flying test and could not  return because of a certain breakdown. Premier Zhou ordered:  "The plane must not be allowed to move and must remain there,  and must return as soon as the breakdown is fixed."    At that moment, Lin Biao and Ye Qun were aware that Premier  Zhou was inquiring about the movement of the Trident, and became  more panic-stricken. In order to conceal their plot of fleeing  to Guangzhou, at 2322 Ye Qun deliberately telephoned Premier  Zhou: "Vice Chairman Lin wants to move." The premier asked:  "Move by air or on the ground?" Ye Qun answered: "By air."  The premier asked: "Do you have a plane?" Ye Qun said: "No."  Ye Qun's answer gave herself away. At that moment, the premier  knew that not only did the Trident-256 remain in Shanhaiguan,  they had also dispatched an Il-14 to that place." Ye Qun's lie  proved that they had plotted to flee to the south. Premier Zhou  immediately called Li Zuopeng (because Shanhaiguan Airport was  managed by the Navy): "Special plane No 256 at the Shanhaiguan  Airport must not be allowed to move; only with an order jointly  issued by you, Huang Yongsheng, Wu Faxian, and me can the plane  take off." However, Li Zuopeng tampered with the premier's  order, and changed it into "only with the orders of one of the  four leaders can the plane take off." At that moment, the  premier frequently walked in and out, and I knew that something  must be happening."    At 0032 on 13 September the security guards in Beidaihe  reported that Lin Biao disregarded the obstruction of the guards  and forcefully made the plane take off! The Shanhaiguan Airport  reported this to Li Zuopeng three times and asked him what to do  if the plane attempted to take off. However, Li Zuopeng did not  issue an order to obstruct the plane. When Premier Zhou was  told about this, he immediately telephoned Chairman Mao to  report this to him and ask for instructions. After returning to  our room, the premier told me that Lin Biao had fled by plane!  He ordered me to rush to the Air Force Headquarters of the  Central Military Commission to assume personal command on his  behalf, and ordered me to report the situation to him without  delay. The premier also instructed me that I must not leave the  command post 24 hours a day. In fact, I did not leave Air Force  Headquarters for five consecutive days and nights. At the same  time, the premier sent Comrade Yang Dezhou to follow Wu Faxian  to the Xijiao Airport (in fact, keeping watch on Wu's action) to  control the situation. He also sent Comrade Ji Dengkui to  control the Air Force Headquarters of the Beijing Military  Region. The premier also issued a "no-fly order": "All  airports throughout the country must be closed; no plane is  allowed to take off. All radars must be set in motion to  monitor the skies." I rushed to Air Force Headquarters, jumped  out of my car, and rushed into the combat command office.  There, I summoned Liang Pu, chief of staff of the Air Force,  and both of us stared at the huge radar screen that covered the  whole wall. At that moment, on the screen, I clearly saw the  moving bright spot which indicated the position of the plane.  It was moving between Chengdeng and the Sino-Mongolian  borderline.    Premier Zhou asked the control officer: "Can they hear you  if you call plane 256 through radio?"    The control officer answered: "Yes, they can."    The premier said: "I need to talk to Pan Jingyin (we already  knew that Pan was the plane's pilot), please put me through."    The control officer said: "He turned on the radio, but did  not reply."    The premier said: "Then, please call plane 256 and tell them  that we want them to fly back, and they may land at either  Dongjiao Airport or Xijiao Airport in Beijing. I, Zhou Enlai,  will meet them at the airport."    The control officer reported: "He did not answer."    The plane took a tricky course. It first flew westward, and  then turned to the north.    Liang Pu and I nervously watched the huge screen. Liang Pu  said: "The plane is not flying in a normal condition." I  asked: "What do you mean?" Liang said: "First, it is not  flying along any international course; second, it is flying  northward, and will soon cross the border and enter Mongolia;  third, it is flying at a low altitude." I sat at a huge desk.  It was the commanding room of the Air Force, and there is a red  telephone through which I could directly call the premier. I  continuously reported to him the position, altitude, flying  direction of the plane. When I asked him how to handle the  event, he told me that he had asked Chairman Mao for  instructions. The chairman said: As the skies want to drop  rains and the mother wants to remarry herself, let him go as he  likes.    On the early morning of 13 September, the plane flew out of  China.    I reported this to the premier immediately.    At 0315 that morning, a report came from Shahe Airport: "A  helicopter just took off and flew northward toward Zhangjiakou."  I again immediately reported this to the premier. After asking  Chairman Mao for instructions, the premier instructed: "Effect  a forced landing. If it refuses to land, shoot it down!" I  ordered the Air Force of the Beijing Military Region to dispatch  eight Jian- 6 fighters to intercept the helicopter and forced it  to land in Huairou County. Zhou Yuchi killed Comrade Chen  Xiuwen, who drove the helicopter back, and then committed  suicide together with Yu Xinye. Li Weixin was captured alive.    What would happen after Lin Biao's plane flew out of China?  At that moment it was expected that Lin Biao might flee to the  Soviet Union. Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou made arrangements  against all consequences caused by the incident.    Local leaders must also be informed of the Lin Biao incident  as soon as possible in order to cope with any contingencies.  The premier personally phoned the principal leaders of all  military regions, provinces, autonomous regions, and  municipalities and informed them of the happenings in an  implicit but clear way.    After all the arrangements were made, Premier Zhou had  worked  more than 50 consecutive hours without rest. At 1400 on the  afternoon of 14 September, shortly after the premier fell  asleep, the Foreign Ministry delivered an urgent telegram from  the Chinese embassy in Mongolia. We could hardly awaken the  premier. He asked the secretary to read the telegram. When he  heard that Lin Biao's Trident-256 had crashed somewhere near  Ondorhaan in Mongolia, he immediately reported this to Chairman  Mao.    I started organizing the investigation that night. According  to Li Weixin's confession, we searched his residence and found a  large quantity of evidence of the Lin Biao Counterrevolutionary  Clique's crimes. Among other things, there was the "Outline of  Project 571," a plan for assassinating Chairman Mao. There was  also plenty of evidence showing that they planned to set up  another central power organ in south China. I immediately sent  some people to deliver the evidence to Premier Zhou and Chairman  Mao.    In the Air Force, a five-member group headed by Comrade Cao  Lihuai was set up to assist me.    In the course of the investigation, Chairman Mao stressed  the  need to act according to established policies, and repeatedly  told us that only a very small number of people were Lin Biao's  diehard followers, and the concrete historical conditions for  most erring comrades should be considered. At that time, as Lin  Biao was the party's vice chairman, people were not aware of his  conspiracy. So it is necessary to carry out the policy of  learning from past mistakes to avoid future ones, and curing the  sickness to save the patient when handling the erring comrades.  They should be forgiven as long as they correct their mistakes.    Concretely speaking, should all the tens of assistants and  secretaries working with Lin Biao be fired? I don't think this  is a proper way. Explanation should be given to them so that  they may receive reeducation and then be assigned to other  posts. They should not be fired, because they were sent by the  party to work with Lin Biao.    Chairman Mao's instructions ensured the smooth development  of  the investigation.    After the 13 September Incident, Chairman Mao seriously  reexamined various events during the Cultural Revolution, and  personally corrected some ultra-leftist practices. For example,  he instructed us to rehabilitate as many cadres as possible and  to do this as soon as possible. The old marshals and many old  comrades who were sent to other provinces by Lin Biao under the  pretext of "evacuation for the purpose of war preparations" were  successively allowed to return to Beijing.    After that, Chairman Mao also personally examined many  petitions and letters of appeal for the rehabilitation of old  cadres, and wrote his instructions on them. He entrusted such  affairs to the General Political Department. Under the  leadership of Premier Zhou and Marshal Ye, we did a great deal  of arduous work, thwarted the obstruction of the "Gang of Four,"  and rehabilitated a large number of senior officers in the armed  forces.</p>

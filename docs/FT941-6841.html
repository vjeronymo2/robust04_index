			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Labour costs not main problem Sir, Martin Wolf ('A relapse into Eurosclerosis', February 24) gives an eloquent exposition of the free-market perspective on Europe's jobs problem, but it is massively over-simplistic. While many of the points he makes are important, to put the prime responsibility for high EU unemployment on excessive labour costs gets us nowhere. First, much of the jobs problem in Europe at present concerns the lack of demand for unskilled, usually male workers. The US answer that Mr Wolf would have us embrace involves pushing down the market wage and non-wage costs for many workers. But will this ever really allow us to undercut competition in the tradeable sector from the developing world? And do not the high non-employment rates of unskilled males in the US also indicate that such a policy simply leads to withdrawal from the official labour market? Second, what of the countries supposedly putting the EU under such pressure  -the east Asian tigers mentioned by those business leaders you surveyed? Certainly they have used the power of the market in their climb to the top, but this has not involved complete deregulation or pure free-market forces but has balanced strategies to promote long-termism alongside the dynamism of market forces. Competitiveness increasingly means working closely with employees, encouraging continuing training and having flexible staffs - all things that may be threatened by an over-reliance on a short-term, hire-and-fire, insecure jobs market. Third, there is considerable evidence in economic literature that there are effective alternatives to the deregulated American model of capitalism. Why give up on them just because the EU is at the bottom of a severe recession (due to an excessive 'free market' belief in the power of low inflation to generate growth) and because structural changes are needed? As Professor Richard Freeman of Harvard University has commented of the US jobs success story: 'To many Europeans the virtues may look overwhelming, in terms of higher employment and reduced unemployment. To many Americans, the costs are devastating in terms of poverty, inner-city slums, homelessness . . . The US has not achieved nirvana - save for the highly skilled and the very rich.'

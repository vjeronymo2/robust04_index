			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NIGHT STALKER VERDICTS;  </P> <P> KILLER'S CHAIR IS EMPTY IN SOLEMN COURTROOM  </P> <P> For six months in 1985, Richard Ramirez was an elusive source of terror,  stalking random victims under cover of darkness. On Wednesday afternoon, as a  jury prepared to declare him guilty of 13 murders and 30 related felonies,  Ramirez again managed to vanish from view.  </P> <P> At his request, Ramirez was escorted by seven deputies to a courtroom holding  cell where, alone, he would listen to the verdicts via a sound system. His foot  chains jangled as he was led away.  </P> <P> So there was an empty yellow chair at the defense table as the verdicts came  in. It was one of the few unoccupied seats in the courtroom of Superior Court  Judge Michael A. Tynan, who has presided over the Night Stalker trial for six  months.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Courtroom Is Filled  </P> <P> The courtroom on this day was filled with seven relatives of Ramirez's victims  and more than 70 reporters, court watchers, detectives and district attorney's  personnel.  </P> <P> It took more than 30 minutes for all of the verdicts to be read. After  completing the first 10, Tynan's shaky-voiced clerk, Josephine Williams, asked  to be relieved of the task. Tynan continued himself.  </P> <P> During the reading, the 12 jurors and seven alternates stared solemnly ahead.  Deputy Dist. Atty. Phil Halpin jotted notes on a legal pad. Defense attorney  Daniel Hernandez stared at the judge as he repeated the words.  </P> <P> For each count, the same conclusion was read: "We the jury in the above  entitled action find the defendant Richard Ramirez guilty."  </P> <P> The dry legalese seemed in jarring contrast to the horror of the acts they  ascribed to Ramirez, count by count.  </P> <P> Among those present was Judith Arnold. One July day in 1985, she had discovered  the bodies of her parents, Maxon and and Lela Kneiding, in their Glendale home.  They had failed to show up in church. Both had been shot in the head and their  throats were slashed.  </P> <P> "I'm here to see justice done. It's been too long," Arnold had said minutes  before the jurors filed into the 11th-floor courtroom of the downtown Criminal  Courthouse.  </P> <P> Arnold, her husband Bill's arm around her shoulder, sat flush-faced as the  verdicts were read. When Tynan came to the Kneidings' names, counts 28 through  30, Arnold gripped her husband's right hand tightly and shut her eyes.  </P> <P> "Guilty," said the judge evenly.  </P> <P> Arnold breathed deeply, opened her eyes, and daubed at her tears with a tissue.  </P> <P> A little later, Arnold said she felt "somewhat" relieved. She said she would  reserve further comment until after the penalty phase of the trial, in which  Ramirez could be sentenced to death.  </P> <P> Also present were the son and two grandchildren of Joyce Nelson, a 61-year-old  Monterey Park resident bludgeoned to death in July, 1985.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Too Sick to Watch  </P> <P> Before the verdict in the Nelson murder was announced, her granddaughter  hurriedly left the courtroom. She whispered to her father that she was too sick  to watch.  </P> <P> Besides Ramirez, other regulars at his trial were missing at the end Wednesday.  About 10 women of all ages had appeared faithfully as Ramirez's case slowly  wound its way through the preliminary hearing phase and into trial.  </P> <P> The women never fully explained the attraction Ramirez held for them, although  some said they were convinced of his innocence and a few described him as  attractive. In any case, none showed up for the verdict.  </P></p>

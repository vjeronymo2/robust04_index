			<p><P> January 23, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON CALIFORNIA: PRESERVING THE PROGRESS AT YOSEMITE  </P> <P> I remember the first time I saw California. It was 1967, an early spring just  before the Summer of Love. I had dropped out of college and come chugging  across the great American desert in a rusty Ford with no spare tire. My hair  snaked down my neck and I was, in all respects, a cliche of the period except  for one thing. I was not headed to San Francisco to be a revolutionary. I was  headed here, to Yosemite.  </P> <P> Having quit the academic life, I needed a place of refuge. So, for about three  weeks, I spent my days settled into an armchair in the great hall of the  Ahwahnee Hotel here. If you have lived long in California, surely you know this  place. The ceilings are as high as a cathedral, the walls draped with Navajo  rugs, the windows bright with the light of the valley.  </P> <P> Every morning I would find my armchair and read murder mysteries while the sun  warmed up the valley. In the afternoons I would take walks and at night sleep  in the car. Yosemite was the most benign and lovely place I had ever seen. I  was mostly broke and paid for nothing except a few groceries. I finished a  half-dozen books in my chair and watched spring arrive through the windows. No  one ever questioned my right to the armchair or asked me to leave, and that  first spring remains one of the best memories of California.  </P> <P> I tell this story to illustrate a point. You can walk into the Ahwahnee Hotel  today and still find that same armchair in the same place. The Ahwahnee and  Yosemite Valley have changed very little in the 20 years or so since my first  visit. It's part of what I love about this place. I can depend on the status  quo here.  </P> <P> I bring up this subject because this year marks the centennial for Yosemite. In  the coming months you will hear more and more about the centennial celebration,  and you will also hear a rising debate over the future of the park.  </P> <P> Some of our more esteemed environmental groups will lay claim to the argument  that the National Park Service has betrayed Yosemite. They will say the  government has failed to carry out a management plan to institute major changes  in the park. It is true enough that the plan was not carried out. It is not  true that this amounts to a betrayal of the park.  </P> <P> Perhaps you recall this plan, which became famous for its unusual approach. The  Park Service sent tens of thousands of questionnaires to people of all  persuasions, trying to find what kind of Yosemite they wanted. About 20,000  answers came back. The vast majority indicated that they preferred the park to  remain pretty much as it was. In other words, they wanted the status quo.  </P> <P> A couple of examples from the survey: Only about one-third of the respondents  said they would favor excluding cars from the park, and only one-fourth wanted  the number of overnight accommodations reduced.  </P> <P> Yet the final plan included both these elements. It proposed a scheme whereby  no one could simply drive into the valley. A bus trip would be required. Hotel  rooms would decline in number and employee housing would be moved out of the  valley, forcing the workers to commute over the same roads used by visitors.  </P> <P> Why did the Park Service endorse a plan that the public clearly did not want?  Most likely it was intimidated by the major conservation groups who have always  regarded Yosemite as holy ground. Yosemite is the place, after all, that  nurtured the naturalist John Muir, environmentalist David Brower, photographer  Ansel Adams. You can go on and on. If social engineering was necessary to  "save" a place as sacred as Yosemite, then so be it.  </P> <P> But save Yosemite from what? It's true that on three or four weekends each  summer the valley becomes so crowded it looks like Van Nuys with scenery.  Anyone crazy enough to visit Yosemite on July 4 deserves all the misery they  get.  </P> <P> Otherwise, Yosemite's problems are minor, and this truth has finally been  recognized by the Park Service. Instead of enforcing its mandated nightmare,  the Park Service has tinkered here and there. Traffic flow has been smoothed  and a free shuttle bus operates inside the valley. Some ugly congestion spots  have been removed.  </P> <P> And it works. You can still drive into the valley with a picnic basket or a  couple of bicycles and have a swell time. You can, in the summertime, walk 100  feet from the road and hardly be aware that you share Yosemite with thousands  of others.  </P> <P> You could even snuggle into my armchair for a good read, and I bet no one would  bother you. That's the kind of place Yosemite was, and still is. Not such a bad  gift for a centennial.  </P></p>

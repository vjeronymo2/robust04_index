			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace </F> and reconciliation in Chiapas, in his Mexico City office on 1  June]    [Text] Ladies and gentlemen: We have reached a crucial  stage in the peace process in Chiapas. The fact that the  Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN] has concluded  consultations for an honorable peace in Chiapas -- consultations  that resulted from the talks in San Cristobal de las Casas -- is  an indication of the EZLN's sense of responsibility. As  everyone knows, the EZLN's CCRI- CG [Clandestine Indian  Revolutionary Movement - General Command] has declared itself in  permanent session to discuss the opinions received and to make a  response, which would be made known to the public.    Therefore, we are at a crucial stage of the peace  reconstruction process. The communities that were consulted  were precisely those that decided to go to war. The fact that  these communities have been consulted on the possibility of  peace is in itself a political fact of the utmost importance.  Of course, the conclusion of the consultation does not mean  that a new step in favor of peace has been taken. Three  strategic possibilities are presented as an outcome of the  Chiapas conflict.    The first one is that decisions by the sides, accidents, or  social events foreign to the sides lead to an act of  belligerence in the future. The second one is that the current  situation, which has prevented war, might continue by the will  of the sides as a result of new political decisions and the  continuation of the truce, that is, by mediation and  communication.    The third possibility is that, as a result of the EZLN's  current decision to hold consultations and the Mexican  Government's own decisions, a new step can be taken to construct  peace, which can increase security for the Chiapas community,  the Mexican Army, the EZLN, and the country in general.    The point we have reached is the result of a special effort  for peace on the part of the government, the Mexican Army, the  State of Chiapas, the Mexican Congress, the Chiapas Congress,  the Higher Court of Justice of Chiapas, the Mexican society, and  the EZLN, as well as mediation and the communities. All of these  political forces have unanimously supported peace. This is not  the time to wait with our arms crossed. If the required steps  are not taken before the August elections, it will be very  difficult to make any headway in the future.    To consolidate progress in the peace process, today, I  presented to the president of the Republic a confidential report  on the status of the conflict and the political actions that the  government can take, indicating the solution that I regard as  the most appropriate considering the causes of the uprising and  the solution that can protect the interests of society and the  Mexican State. In this report, I requested the president of the  Republic's support for decisions that might represent a new  response of harmony to the EZLN's probable answer.    In addition, today, I sent to the EZLN General Command a  confidential communique mentioning the points that would  increase the tranquility of society and the Mexican Army,  reassure the EZLN itself, and represent a significant  contribution for the peace process.    Society is not asking to have the sides confront one another  in a dilemma of peace or war. Instead, society demands a clear,  unambiguous demonstration, such as the demonstrations at the  beginning of the year, which made it possible to stop the war.    On the one hand, society asks for a public expression --  with  nonbelligerent actions -- of the EZLN's commitment for a  political solution. On the other, society asks for a full  definition -- with nonbelligerent actions -- on the part of the  Mexican Government.    No one should grow impatient in this decisive hour. For this  reason, I hereby appeal to all political, social, and civil  forces, economic sectors, national leaders, and the local and  international media, to join their voices in support of the  peace process.    The possibility of a new step forward in the peace process  is, not only in the hands of the EZLN, but in the hands of the  government and civil society. This is the time for those truly  concerned for peace to express themselves.</p>

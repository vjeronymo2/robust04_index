			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Linking Kashmir and the Nuclear Issue"] </F>   [Text] President Farooq Leghari, currently on a visit to  the United States, has in an interview with Cable News Network  (CNN) urged the U.S. to play a key role in resolving the Kashmir  issue. He has, at the same time, sought to establish a linkage  between Kashmir and the nuclear issue, which remains high on the  U.S. agenda. However, the problem is that current U.S. policy  favours dealing with the two issues separately. This was fairly  evident from the observations of the U.S. deputy secretary of  state after his recent visit to the subcontinent. Kashmir, as  far as the U.S. is concerned, is to be dealt with by India and  Pakistan, bilaterally, under the terms of the Simla Agreement.  This, of course, suits India which has successfully managed to  avoid meaningful bilateral negotiations with Pakistan on the  Kashmir issue for over two decades. At the same time, India has  consistently turned down proposals for involving any third party  in the matter and asserted, at times with a touch of the  indignant, that the two neighbours were perfectly capable of  resolving their own problems. However, it is clear that Pakistan  now sees a third party role as unavoidable if India is to be  pushed into addressing the Kashmir issue seriously and put an  end to its efforts to resolve it through sheer brute force.  Such a role would be far from unprecedented in the context of  settling matters between the two countries. As President  Leghari pointed out at another forum, the Indus Basin Treaty and  the Runn of Kutch award were agreements reached on difficult  issues only after third party intercession.    As for the nuclear issue, not only is the U.S. unwilling to  link it with Kashmir, it also seems to be giving way to India's  contention that the nuclear programmes of India and Pakistan  cannot be treated on a par and should be dealt with separately  by the United States. In effect, this means that the U.S. should  continue to pressurise Pakistan through various means, such as  the Pressler Amendment, while India continues developing its  nuclear potential as well as missile technology. It may well be  in this context that President Leghari has struck a tough note  on the issue of inspection, of any kind, of nuclear sites.  While a recent statement of the foreign minister made it seem  as if Pakistan was willing to consider on merits a U.S. proposal  for non-intrusive inspection, the president has now pointedly  emphasised the aspect of linkage by asserting that Pakistan will  accept inspection or verification regimes only in the context of  a regional solution involving India. The U.S. may have logical  grounds for believing that certain major issues pertaining to  the subcontinent are more amenable to a solution, when dealt  with separately, but if such a mode is seen to work to the  advantage of only one party the other is bound to see linkage,  at least in some areas, as unavoidable.</p>

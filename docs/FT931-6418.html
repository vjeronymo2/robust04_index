			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Tokyo defies US anger over supercomputer THE Japanese government yesterday brushed aside US criticism of its supercomputer procurement policy and went ahead with the installation of a Japanese-made supercomputer in an attempt to end one of the most controversial trade disputes between the two countries. Japan's National Institute for Fusion Science, a government research institute, has installed a supercomputer made by NEC, the Japanese electronics group, which won a contract over Cray Research, a leading US manufacturer. The installation of the NEC machine rejects outright claims by the US that the Japanese company won the contract as a result of a public procurement policy that favours Japanese companies. It comes as the US has stepped up pressure on Japan to open its markets, particularly for high technology electronic products. Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, expressed concern on Friday about Japanese public procurement of supercomputers. The US is sending Mr Ira Wolf, assistant trade rep-resentative, to Japan at the end of the week to discuss a number of thorny trade issues, and is more than likely to touch on government procurement of supercomputers. Cray Research said yesterday it had not been able to evaluate, at a demonstration held by the Japanese research institute, whether NEC's machine met the performance criteria required to satisfy the terms of the bid. The US company has questioned whether NEC's machine could actually do what it professed to do and claimed that the institute had used an evaluation process that favoured NEC's machine. The Japanese government, which set up a Supercomputer Procurement Review Board after US threats of retaliation, rejected Cray's complaint last October. The research institute held a test of the NEC machine's performance last week and found it met required criteria. The Japanese side believes it holds a trump card and is not prepared to bow readily to US demands. 'Cray has already supplied a few supercomputers to Japanese government institutes,' Mr Tadashi Watanabe, general manager of NEC's supercomputer marketing division, pointed out yesterday. 'But not one US public body has bought a Japanese supercomputer.' A representative of the research institute said: 'We are the ones who bought the supercomputer so we are the ones who need to be satisfied by the NEC machine's performance.'</p>

			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Bundesbank's waiting game THE BUNDESBANK has emerged from the foreign exchange turbulence of the past month with its international credibility fully restored. Sterling, the French franc and any other pretenders to the D-Mark's anti-inflationary throne have been put firmly in their place. But at home, the Bundesbank's position is far less comfortable. Until Mr Helmut Kohl's solidarity talks bear tangible fruit, the Bundesbank must remain unyielding. Official German interest rates have now been too high for too long. But they may have to remain high for a while longer. The Bundesbank has performed its foreign exchange balancing act with great skill. It has kept official interest rates high, offering only a modest cut in the discount rate which has been more than offset by a trade-weighted appreciation of the D-Mark. But heavy intervention to support the franc has caused short-term money market interest rates to fall by almost a full percentage point since their August peak, allowing a number of European countries to cut their interest rates too. Blunt instrument Yet Germany's domestic imbalances are more than the Bundesbank's artistry can handle alone. Loose fiscal policy continues to stoke up domestic inflationary pressure outside the traded goods sector. But monetary policy is proving to be a very blunt instrument with which to deal with this service sector inflation. The rapid growth of the distorted broad money aggregate only confirms the resilience of publicly subsidised spending and investment to high interest rates. The Bundesbank may choose to ignore this broad money overshoot but it cannot ignore the underlying inflationary pressure. Private service output grew by 5 per cent in the year to the second quarter and service sector prices are rising at an annual 5.2 per cent, explaining why consumer price inflation is still creeping up. The new value-added tax, to be introduced in January, will also raise consumer price inflation and risks feeding into wage demands. The longer that the Bundesbank is left alone to deal with these problems, the greater the risks. High interest rates and a strong D-Mark already have German industry in a vice: industrial output grew by just 0.8 per cent in the year to the second quarter, orders are depressed and profits are squeezed. The last thing that Germany needs is a deep recession in the traded goods sector which pulls the rest of the economy down with it and pushes the fiscal deficit out of control. Veiled promises Yet the Bundesbank cannot move unless there is an offsetting tightening of fiscal policy and evidence that wage demands will moderate over the coming year. Veiled promises of compromises to come are not enough. The rest of the German political establishment must shoulder its share of the burden. Mr Kohl must propose higher and more progressive income taxes to close the fiscal deficit. The unions must agree to zero real wage growth in west Germany based on an inflation rate next year of no more than 3 per cent. The employers, with union agreement, must scrap the misguided plan for wage convergence between the eastern and western lander. Only then will the Bundesbank be right to yield. For now it has no choice but to leave the discount and Lombard rates unchanged, however unpopular both in Germany and in Europe. Germany's European partners already have good reason to feel aggrieved. But they should address their complaints to Bonn.</p>

The document envisages close ties between the  republic and NATO, especially regarding reform in the armed  forces, officer training, and joint exercises. It stipulates  involvement of Ukraine's military subunits in UN and CSCE  operations, open national defense and budget planning,  democratic control over the military sphere, and exchange of  relevant information. Partnership for Peace member countries  can consult NATO members when faced with a direct threat to  their territorial integrity, political independence, or  security, but this does not imply security guarantees on the  part of the NATO.    Ukraine's Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Borys Tarasyuk  told UNIAN: "It is of special importance to Ukraine to be able  to initiate such consultations, since Ukrainian political  circles have for a long time been voicing concern over the  state's security, especially in the wake of parliament's  confirmation on 3 February of the country's intention to get rid  of nuclear weapons completely."    "Membership in Partnership for Peace will enable Ukraine to  build its armed forces on a new basis, approaching world  standards, and involve its military subunits in various  operations run by the UN and the CSCE which will enhance its  authority," said Yuriy Serheyev, head of the information  directorate at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, commenting on  the signing of the document.</p>

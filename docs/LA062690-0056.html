			<p><P> June 26, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: PEOPLE WATCH  </P> <P> Melina Mercouri for Mayor: Melina Mercouri, Greece's popular actress turned  fiery socialist politician, will seek to become mayor of Athens in municipal  elections in October. The Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK), which was  defeated in a general election last June after eight years in power, has chosen  Mercouri as its candidate against the ruling New Democracy Party.  </P> <P> "Mercouri is probably the only person in PASOK popular enough to attract even  conservative voters. If she wins the election, it could mean a new start for  our party," a senior PASOK official said. Mercouri, 65, served as culture  minister from 1981 until 1989 in the government of former Prime Minister  Andreas Papandreou and led a campaign to promote Athens as host for the 1996  Olympic Games. She is best known for her role as a prostitute in the 1960 film  "Never on Sunday," for which she won an Oscar nomination. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

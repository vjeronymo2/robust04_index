			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (America): US stocks fail to sustain their early gains Wall Street US MARKETS finished a volatile week in mixed form. Share prices rose strongly in the morning, following better consumer confidence figures and an upward revision of fourth quarter gross domestic product, but fell back amid profit-taking to end slightly lower, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 1.78 at 3,267.67, having at one stage been more than 20 points higher. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended down 1.14 at 412.72, while the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks slipped 0.49 to 633.46. Turnover on the NYSE was 203m shares. After a raft of conflicting economic statistics in recent days, yesterday's news was on the upbeat side. The revision in fourth quarter GDP was expected, but the change from the original estimate of a 0.3 per cent rise in GDP to a 0.8 per cent rise was slightly bigger than anticipated. In addition, the University of Michigan's consumer confidence index for February showed a modest improvement in sentiment, which helped offset Tuesday's big drop in consumer confidence as measured by the Conference Board. Auto stocks were in demand after Merrill Lynch, the big securities house, upgraded its intermediate-term rating on the big three manufacturers from 'neutral' to 'above average'. General Motors rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 37 1/2 , Chrysler Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 17 and Ford Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 37. May Department Stores rose Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 61 7/8 on the news that the company plans to dissolve a real estate partnership with Prudential Insurance, which will allow May to take a Dollars 200m pre-tax gain in its second quarter earnings. Coca-Cola rose Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 81 3/4 after investors shrugged off news of a multi-million dollar lawsuit filed by 7-Up Company alleging that Coca-Cola was disrupting 7-Up's arrangements in the lemon and lime segment of the soft drinks market. McDonnell Douglas fell Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 63 1/2 after Taiwan Aerospace said it may reduce its investment in the US company's airliner business from 40 per cent, as originally planned, to as low as 25 per cent. Callaway Golf, makers of the popular Big Bertha driver, enjoyed an impressive first full day on the market. The stock finished at Dollars 32 3/8 , well up on the initial offering price of Dollars 20. Home Shopping Network jumped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 8 1/4 on the news that the cable television group is in talks about a possible merger with rival shopping network QVC. On the over-the-counter market, MCI Communications rose Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 35 in turnover of 2.9m shares after the company won a two-year contract for long-distance telephone services from the US federal government. Novell slipped Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 61 3/4 despite fiscal first quarter net income of 34 cents a share that was in line with expectations. SunWest Financial Services rose Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 32 1/4 after the New Mexico-based finance group said it was considering merger proposals from several parties. Canada TORONTO closed mixed in moderate trading. The TSE-300 closed at 3,581.94, down 2.14, although advances led declines by 299 to 283 in volume of 26.8m shares. Trading value fell to CDollars 285.5m from Dollars 384.2m.</p>

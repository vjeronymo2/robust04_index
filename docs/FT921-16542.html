			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report Sizeable changes in aluminium and zinc stocks at London Metal Exchange warehouses were reported on New Year's Eve and prompted an apparently perverse reaction. Aluminium stocks moved closer towards 1m tonnes with a 32,225 tonnes rise taking the total to a record 987,150 tonnes. Traders said this produced some dealer selling before trade buying interest reversed the trend so, despite the stock rise, aluminium for delivery in three months ended New Year's Eve Dollars 1.75 up at Dollars 1,150.50 a tonne. Zinc stocks fell by 4,600 tonnes to 152,000 tonnes after a big shipment out of Rotterdam. Traders said this was possibly the tail-end of a large merchant shipment of Peruvian metal to the US. Three-month zinc prices closed on December 31 down 50 cents at Dollars 1,115 a tonne. Dealers said trading was very thin. Copper prices were under modest downside pressure after news that LME stocks rose by 1,925 tonnes to 327,425 tonnes, the highest since March, 1984. Cocoa futures closed with moderate losses after active fund-selling. With New York also sharply weaker, near-March tested what was seen as key support at Pounds 742 a tonne. Dealers said there was no fundamental reason behind the drop in price, other than long speculator liquidation. Compiled from Reuters</p>

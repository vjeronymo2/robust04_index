			<p>BFN     [Text] The prime minister has declared in the Rajya Sabha  that there is no pressure from any quarter on the indigenous  missile program. Mr. Narasimha also categorically stated that  India will not be swayed in any manner by what Pakistan does.  We have our own threat perceptions, and there is no question of  equating India with Pakistan.    Intervening during question hour, the prime minister allayed  fears that the United States is bringing pressure on the  government to slow down the missile program. These are  unnecessary doubts, he said, and added that since there is no  pressure, the question of slowing down the development and  induction of various missiles does not arise. Answering a  supplementary, Mr. Narasimha Rao said many matters came up for  discussion during the talks, the American deputy secretary of  state, Mr. Talbott, had with him in New Delhi recently. Both  sides, he said, agreed that there is no pressure on India and  there should be none either.    Earlier, replying to the main question the minister of state  for defense, Mr. Mallikarjun, told the members amid thumping of  desks that the defense scientists have given the country the  capability to counter any missile threat from Pakistan. He said  there is no program to make any Intercontinental Ballistic  Missile--ICBM. He said that Prithvi is expected to be inducted  into the defense forces during the current financial year and  Trishul next year. Development work on the medium range  surface-to-air missile Akash and the third generation antitank  missile Nag is expected to be completed during 1995-96.    After this, both these missiles will enter the phase of  (?user class) -- production and induction. About Agni, he said,  with the third test the technology demonstration of the reentry  phase has been completed. In a written reply, Mr. Mallikarjun  also informed the house that offers have been received from  Russia, Israel, France, and Britain for the upgradation of the  MiG-21 aircraft.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has said that close  cooperation will be conducted with Turk-Is [Turkish  Confederation of Labor] on issues concerning the labor sector,  without changing the targets of the stability program.    Ciller received Turk-Is leader Bayram Meral and Secretary  General Semsi Denizer at the prime ministerial residence and  discussed the stability program with them. In a statement after  the meeting, Ciller said that she will benefit from the views of  Turk-Is regarding this issue, and that the Turk-Is proposals  will be studied.    [Begin Ciller recording] We will work together with them on  every single issue. We will study every single thing that can  be done in line with their requests, without changing the  targets of the program. We will do that on the basis of the  entire issue of the public economic enterprises. We will start  to work in very close cooperation as soon as possible. [end  recording]    The prime minister stressed that unless measures are taken,  more workers will be without jobs in the future. The basis of  our efforts, she said, is to minimize the suffering of the  workers, and to create jobs for more youths in the future.    [Begin Ciller recording] The aim is never to leave such  problems for our workers in the coming years. To achieve that,  we will discuss these issues together. Meral had very valuable  and good proposals to make. I gave instructions for all these  proposals to be studied one by one. This cooperation will  continue in the coming months. I want to state once again that  we will not make our workers suffer. We will ensure that they  get their legal rights in the best way, always, and under all  conditions. [end recording]    The Turk-Is leader said that if his proposals and views are  taken into consideration, the problems and difficulties of the  workers will be minimized.    In a statement to the press while leaving the residence,  Bayram Meral said that the prime minister thought Turk-Is' views  were reasonable and appropriate. He pointed out that Turk-Is'  requests in connection with the public economic enterprises will  be taken into consideration.    [Begin Meral recording] Turk-Is and the government will sit  around the table and try to minimize the problems by studying  every single installation. In this way we will minimize the  workers' suffering to almost no suffering at all. I hope we  will succeed. We told our prime minister of our views. She said  that she considers our views very positive and serious. We were  happy to hear that. The prime minister instructed State  Minister Datca to convene a meeting in a short time. [end  recording]    Replying to a question, Meral said that if the problems are  not solved, the decisions of the Turk-Is leaders council will be  implemented.    Asked if the planned labor actions were postponed, Meral  said: No. The Turk-Is leaders council has set up an action  committee. The action committee will meet on Tuesday. The  decisions it will reach will be implemented to the letter.</p>

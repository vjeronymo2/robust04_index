			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Nicaragua has sent several planeloads of Soviet Bloc weapons to Panama in  recent months to help strongman Manuel A. Noriega prepare his forces for any  U.S. military attack, according to Sandinista military and non-diplomatic U.S.  sources in Managua. The shipments included dozens of AK-47 assault rifles,  ammunition and other arms for guerrilla warfare, such as grenade launchers and  light artillery, the sources said. The Sandinistas were told that some, if not  all, the weapons are being used to equip the so-called Dignity Battalions, a  militia formed by Noriega. State Department spokesman Adam Shub said "we can  confirm" that Nicaragua sent the weapons.  </P></p>

			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Japan turns the corner What should be said to a country generous enough to provide its trading partners with goods and services worth Dollars 415bn more than it demanded in return, between 1989 and 1993? A hearty 'thank you' would seem a good start. No Japanese politician or official, not even one as inexperienced as the new socialist prime minister, Tomiichi Murayama, expects this from leaders of the other members of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries in Naples this weekend. What he can expect, instead, is a mixture of whining complaint with grudging approval of his country's efforts to reduce the amount it invests abroad. President Clinton's support for Japanese plans to stimulate the economy and increase imports at least falls into the latter category. US policymakers seem to have learnt some lessons since the bond markets started tumbling. A country expected by the OECD to run a current account deficit of Dollars 141bn this year needs to be careful when insulting the only significant exporter of capital. The deficit may be only 2.1 per cent of US gross domestic product, but it is large in the context of global capital flows. The realisation of US vulnerability to a Japanese investor strike is presumably why US treasury secretary Lloyd Bentsen said yesterday in Naples that 'we do want to see a strong dollar'. The concern is not idle. The 'basic balance' in the Japanese balance of payments, which is the sum of the current account and net long-term capital flows, was an almost incredible Dollars 82bn in the first three months of 1994. This has had to be recycled through short-term private capital flows and official foreign exchange intervention. It is hardly surprising that the yen has risen. Neither is it surprising that Japanese foreign exchange reserves have risen sharply, just as they did after the Louvre accord in February 1987, by Dollars 34.5bn between March 1993 and April 1994. This is a measure of the efforts of the Japanese to support the US dollar. Economic damage However bitter the US complaints about Japanese trade policy, the administration has recognised the extent of US-Japanese economic interdependence. Goldman Sachs argues in a recent paper that even if the entire US bilateral trade deficit with Japan of Dollars 60bn were to be eliminated, the net increase in the US wage bill would probably not be more than Dollars 7bn a year, a mere 0.2 per cent of US personal income. The damage done to the US economy by a collapsing dollar-yen exchange rate and soaring domestic interest rates, as Japanese investors retreat hurt, is certain to exceed that by a considerable margin. Japanese investors are indeed hurt, since the yen has been revalued by 14 per cent against the dollar since the beginning of the year. Such a revaluation entails a substantial decline in the domestic value of dollar-denominated assets. Furthermore, the rising yen endangers the Japanese recovery, by punishing an industrial sector whose output in May was still 12.8 per cent below its peak of three years earlier. Sensible policy The sensible policy is to let the forces of recovery and balance-of-payments adjustment work their way through the Japanese economy. One such force is the effects on liquidity of the intervention in foreign exchange markets. Another is the more positively sloping yield curve. The gap between interest rates on three-month money and 10-year bonds is now just over 2 percentage points, double what it was earlier in the year. This will help financial institutions, weighed down by bad property loans, to recapitalise themselves, on lines pioneered in the US by the Federal Reserve. Above all, there are signs of a consumer-led return to economic growth. In the first quarter of 1994 consumption grew at an annualised rate of 5.8 per cent, driving an annualised increase of 3.9 per cent in gross domestic product. The remarkable ability of Japanese companies to sustain employment during the recession is bound to help sustain consumer confidence, while the improvement in Japan's terms of trade boosts their purchasing power. Provided Japan's internationally exposed companies are not punished by further rises in the yen and it does not implement its planned tax on domestic consumption soon, the recovery should gather in strength. Meanwhile, export volume did not rise at all between January 1991 and January 1994, while import volume rose 9 per cent. Domestic demand-led recovery should stimulate imports further and bring about a significant reduction in the trade surplus. Also pressing Japan in that direction is its surplus on investment income, which reached Dollars 41bn in 1993, almost a fifth of imports. The Japanese should continue to support the dollar and push import liberalisation, in the interests not only of their consumers, but also of export-oriented manufacturing. As for the US, it needs to cool its rhetoric and let political and economic forces bring about the changes in Japan that it seeks.</p>

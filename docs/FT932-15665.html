			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Research - the key to success - Kevin Goldstein-Jackson explains how he picks profitable shares . . . and some that aren't - Diary of a Private Investor THE MAN at the boring cocktail party was disbelieving. 'Are you really Kevin Goldstein-Jackson?' he asked, I felt like replying: 'No. I am really Zarg from the planet Jupiter,' but I resisted the temptation. A few minutes earlier, I had been accosted by a woman who said: 'Oh] You do exist. I thought Kevin Goldstein-Jackson was all made up by journalists.' Once people are convinced I am not a product of someone's imagination, they tend to ask if the things I write about in Diary of a Private Investor are all true. Can I give them some hot share tips and how do I find out about companies before I invest in them? The answers to all these questions are comparatively easy. My brief for this column always has been to write about things that have happened (or are happening) to myself or my family. If I say I have had a particular investment experience, then it is true. The good experiences (like buying shares in NMC for 12.5p and selling them for 205p, or seeing certain shares double in price within a year) are just as valid as the bad experiences (like buying 1,500 shares at 300p in Gresham House Investment Trust for my personal pension scheme and seeing them fall to 8p). Under the Financial Services Act, I am unable to give people specific investment advice other than in the pages of approved publications such as the Financial Times. I cannot give people specific advice (like 'hot' share tips), either in person or by letter. Someone once said to me: 'I like to do what you seem to do. Walk around watching what people are buying. Trying to spot the next trends. But if you see a particular product that is selling well, how can you find out who made it so you can buy shares in the company? Even if there is a manufacturer's name on the product, that manufacturer might, in these days of multi-national corporations, be owned by another company - so how do you find the name of the ultimate owner?' In such cases, I go first to my local reference library and look at Who Owns Whom. This is a series of separate weighty volumes covering the UK, Europe, North America, Australasia and the Far East. It lists many thousands of subsidiaries, with details of their parent companies. If Who Owns Whom cannot provide the answer, then I might ask British Telecom's directory enquiries service to provide me with the number of the company named on the product so I can ask it directly. If the product is made overseas, then I try to find a friendly shop assistant who can tell me the name of the UK distributor. Sometimes, of course, the product is made by a private company and shares in it cannot be bought. Or the product comes from a public-quoted company which, for one reason or another, I would not touch with a barge pole. I also subscribe to Campaign, the weekly magazine for people in the advertising industry. It can be found in many public libraries and is very useful for giving advance notice of new-product launches, with details of the advertising agencies concerned and the makers. In previous FT articles, I have described a number of the things for which I look in a company before I invest. But to find many of those items (like details of directors, profits records and debt levels), I use three publications produced by Hemmington Scott Publishing of City Innovation Centre, 26-31 Whiskin Street, London EC1R 0DT. The most useful is the Hambro Company Guide, published every quarter; an annual subscription costs Pounds 99. It is also available, at a higher charge, on computer disc. The guide gives profits' records and other information about each UK-quoted company. The Arthur Andersen Corporate Register is published twice annually and costs Pounds 150 a year. This gives much more detailed information about directors  -very useful when I want to know the name of a company secretary to contact in order to get the annual report. It includes each company's address. The third Hemmington Scott publication is the Performance Rankings Guide, also published twice annually, for Pounds 135 a year. This, as its name implies, grades companies by a wide variety of criteria: from earnings per share based on a five-year trend, to profit margins within certain sectors. Many companies use the FT's Annual Reports service where, for the cost of a phone call, a reader can get a free copy of any of the reports produced by the participating companies. Details are given on the newspaper's share price pages. I have found this service to be fast and efficient, and the line is open 24 hours a day. Another useful publication is the Estimate Directory, obtainable from Edinburgh Financial Publishing, Freepost, Edinburgh EH3 0EN. This is published monthly and an annual subscription costs Pounds 350. But you can buy four issues - one sent each quarter - for just Pounds 120. The directory is quite new. It started in March last year and collects a wide variety of stockbrokers' estimates for the profits and earnings per share of many quoted UK companies. It also contains details of major shareholders, and a brief outline of the company's main activities. In future, whenever I am depressed about poor performance from a share I have selected, I will turn to the mid-February 1993 issue of the directory and look at the entry for Queens Moat Houses. It tells how, earlier this year, well-known brokers with highly-paid analysts were predicting profits for the company of Pounds 85-90m. I did not buy shares in Queens Moat. I had read the receivership sales notices in the FT and noted there were a lot of hotels for sale at quite low prices (including some well-known names). So, why did anyone think Queens Moat would perform well when, clearly, conditions were tough? Some people expect me to sit behind a flickering computer screen full of information. I think that is the quickest way not to see the wood for the trees - too much information can be just as damaging as too little. But, as well as the reference books mentioned earlier, I also have a large number of company reports plus a collection of press cuttings from the FT and other publications - especially the weekly Investors Chronicle. The cuttings all relate to particular companies in which I have money already or am monitoring for possible future investment. I also keep copies of the FT's share price pages for the last trading day in each year so that I can look back on the annual share price highs and lows for each company. As much as anything, I like to walk around in the real world, getting a 'feel' for a product, a company or a trend. Any private investor can do the same: it does not require any special skill or super-intelligence. I am just an ordinary person who wins sometimes and loses at others. So long as the profits are more than the losses, I will continue doing it my way.</p>

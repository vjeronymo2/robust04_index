			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Finance and The Family: F&amp;C optimistic as net assets rise 8.6% - At a Glance Foreign &amp; Colonial, the UK's largest investment trust, reported this week that net assets rose 8.6 per cent in the first half of the year, compared with a 5 per cent rise in the All-Share. The trust increased the interim dividend from 1.12p to 1.15p and forecast a final dividend of 2.3p. F&amp;C was generally optimistic about the outlook for most stock markets but warned that 'Unless President Clinton can demonstrate soon that he can revive the economy, Wall Street may begin to falter.' The trust's shares are now trading close to asset value.</p>

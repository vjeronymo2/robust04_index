			<p><P> January 17, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SPEEDY BURROUGHS RACES PAST ALHAMBRA  </P> <P> Fast five, those Alhambra High Moors. So fast, in fact, that they almost swiped  the Foothill League lead this past week quicker than you could say "Stop,  thief."  </P> <P> The Moors threatened to run Burroughs out of its own gym Tuesday night with a  fast and furious, who-has-the-ball-now? 25-point second quarter.  </P> <P> But Burroughs, the defending league champion, showed speed of its own, rolling  up a 32-point fourth quarter to hand Alhambra an 80-70 loss at Burroughs.  </P> <P> "They're guard-oriented and they penetrate," Burroughs Coach Ira Sollod said.  "We just had to catch our breath."  </P> <P> With no player taller than 6-foot-1, Alhambra (14-3, 2-1 in league play) relied  on hustle rather than muscle, moving the ball the way the Kings do the puck.  The Moors used perfectly executed trailer passes and shots off assists to  nullify a five-point first-quarter Burroughs' lead and take a 36-28 halftime  advantage.  </P> <P> Guard Hung Duong, averaging 24.9 points, scored 19 points -- 12 in the first  half. Sixth man Hon Trieu, who entered the game with 35 three-point baskets,  added six more toward a team-high 23 points.  </P> <P> "They were swinging the ball pretty good," said Burroughs forward S. J.  Boldvich, who scored 13 points to go with 12 rebounds and eight assists.  </P> <P> Forward Ray Velasquez, who scored a game-high 27 points, nullified Alhambra's  penetration by breaking loose on several fast breaks in the fourth quarter.  </P></p>

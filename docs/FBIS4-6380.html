			<p>BFN     [Text] This is a just-in news. According to Seoul radio  reports, today, approximately 150 members of the National  Federation of General Student Councils broke into the building  of the puppet Defense Ministry where the U.S. defense secretary  and the puppet defense minister were hatching a war plot.  Following this, the students waged a protest demonstration,  chanting slogans opposing Defense Secretary Perry's visit.    In groups, the students demonstrators broke through a guard  post at the front gate of the building around 11:30 AM and  stormed into it. The students staged a demonstration, lying on  the ground with placards reading "We oppose the United States  and Perry's visit!" "We do not want a war!" and "Yankee, Go  Home!" The students lifted up the placards protesting the U.S.  demand on the opening of South Korea's rice market and the  purchase of U.S. weapons.    The puppet clique, dismayed by the students' breaking into  the Defense Ministry building, mobilized some 300 armed  policemen into the spot and committed fascist suppression by  taking all the student protesters to the police station.</p>

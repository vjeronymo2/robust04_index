			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / International Company News: Sparbanken result points to bank sector's struggle LOSSES at Sparbanken Sverige deepened sharply in the first eight months, underlying the severity of the crisis in Sweden's banking sector. The savings bank group made an operating loss of SKr6.5bn (Dollars 1.1bn), against a SKr2.5bn deficit a year ago, after loan losses climbed 62 per cent to SKr10.4bn. It anticipates a full-year loss of SKr8.5bn, with loan losses soaring to SKr14.5bn. The figures are worse than those estimated in April when the government announced a SKr7.3bn bail-out of Forsta Sparbanken. 'The increased loan losses and the reduced operating income are due to the major deterioration which has occurred in the Swedish economy,' said the bank. It warned it might eventually need state help to maintain an 8 per cent capital ratio. Sparbanken Sverige is being formed from the merger of 11 savings banks, including Forsta Sparbanken and Swedbank.</p>

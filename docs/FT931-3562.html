			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Italy's Corruption Scandal: Philosophical investors push up share prices despite probes UNDETERRED by the almost daily spectacle of new boardroom-level arrivals into Milan's decrepit San Vittore prison on corruption allegations, Italian shares have risen by about 12 per cent this year. The resilience of equities to the revelations now involving most leading companies suggests that most investors are unconcerned by the arrests. Rather than tumbling with each new leak about kickbacks on contracts, the capitalisation of most companies has surged in 1993. The reasons lie in expectations of lower interest rates, the benefits of a cheaper lira for exporters and last summer's deal between unions and employers to abolish the scala mobile wage indexation system. Concern about corruption has so far been contained to a handful of cases. The pace of the rises also reflects many investors' under-weight positions in Italian stocks. Once sentiment began to shift last month, topping up depleted portfolios created a bandwagon effect. 'Once the ball started rolling, most investors had to start buying not to miss the market's performance, even if they had doubts about the fundamentals,' says one analyst. Concern about individual arrests has been brushed aside in the context of broader corporate prospects. 'Institutional investors understand that the companies are still in business. Arresting Mr Francesco Paolo Mattioli, Fiat's chief financial officer, doesn't mean it has stopped making cars. The question is whether the new Uno will be a good car, not whether a given executive is in jail,' says Mr Gianluca Codagnone, an analyst at Milan brokers Aloisio, Foglia, Ventura. Fiat's share price has climbed steadily this year, reaching L5,560 yesterday. That compares with L4,810 on February 17 last year, when Mr Mario Chiesa, the Socialist administrator whose testimony triggered the investigations, was arrested. Yet the general rise in prices on the bourse masks differing sectoral performances. Construction has been hit hardest. Shares in Fiat's Cogefar-Impresit building subsidiary have dropped to L2,730 from L3,443 when Mr Chiesa was arrested. Last May, Mr Enzo Papi, the group's former managing director, spent 55 days in San Vittore under interrogation by magistrates. The virtual freeze in public works contracts still dampens the sector's performance. The problems in the building sector have spilled over into related industries. Italmobiliare, the holding company for Mr Giampiero Pesenti, the industrialist detained last month and now freed, have sunk to L40,000 from L64,200 when Mr Chiesa was arrested last year. Italmobiliare's main subsidiary is Italcementi, Italy's biggest cement group. Like other cement and building materials concerns, it has been hurt by the building slowdown and problems at Ciments Francais, the French cement maker it bought last year. Companies dominated by single individuals embroiled in the investigations have also suffered disproportionately. Shares in the Filippo Fochi plant engineering group tumbled on the arrest of Mr Roberto Fochi, its chairman and managing director. His subsequent release from jail, combined with a big Iranian contract, was greeted by a marked recovery in the stock price. Sometimes negative factors have coincided, triggering particularly sharp falls. The Premafin group of Mr Salvatore Ligresti, the Milan property magnate arrested on corruption charges last year, stands out. Shares in Mr Ligresti's Grassetto building concern have tumbled by more than half since Mr Chiesa's arrest. Premafin's share price fall has been even more dramatic, reflecting the role of Mr Ligresti in the group. Premafin's shares have plummeted to L5,500 from L11,075 in mid-February 1992. Shares have also fallen in a handful of cases where investors believe companies may face one-off costs as a result of the investigations. Ferruzzi Finanziaria, one of Italy's biggest private-sector holding companies, and Montedison, its big chemicals and agro-industrial arm, both saw their shares slide when magistrates turned their attention to the ill-fated Enimont chemicals joint venture. Enimont was wound up in late 1990 when the state-owned Eni energy and chemicals group bought out Montedison's 40 per cent stake. The L2,800bn price paid is now under examination, amid allegations of deliberate over-valuation linked to kickbacks to political parties. The Enimont inquiries have already involved some of Italy's best-known entrepreneurs. Mr Raul Gardini, chairman of Montedison's parent company at the time, and Mr Sergio Cragnotti, former Ferruzzi executive who used to be Enimont's managing director, have been told by magistrates they are under investigation. In spite of the uncertainty created by the investigations, many analysts believe the corruption scandal will eventually help Italian companies. 'It will eventually be much easier for the market to judge companies on their skills and competitiveness, rather than the quality of their political contacts,' says Mr Codagnone. The demise of contracting through private tenders, which paved the way for many of the inflated public-sector deals now under investigation, may even help some state groups facing heavy investment programmes. One analyst points out that at least part of a contract - the part which might have represented kickbacks - would not now have to be paid. Most of his colleagues fear the close scrutiny likely to be given to big contracts may slow decision-making. However, they agree the greater transparency that should ensue will cut costs and improve efficiency in the end.</p>

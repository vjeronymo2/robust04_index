			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] A news conference by Foreign Minister Josef  Zieleniec took place today in the Mirror Hall of the Cernin  Palace. David Stahlavsky reports.    [Begin Stahlavsky recording] [passage omitted] Czech Foreign  Minister Josef Zieleniec mentioned the coming state visit by  President Vaclav Havel to India and Thailand. The foreign  minister, together with Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik and  Deputy Industry and Trade Minister Sabela, will accompany the  president.    [Zieleniec] This visit is important for us not only from the  viewpoint of publicity and symbolism but also from the practical  viewpoint with regard to developing trade contacts with this  region.    [Stahlavsky] Czech radio asked Zieleniec why President  Havel,  on his return from Thailand to Prague, is stopping in Kuwait for  brief talks. The foreign minister answered:    [Zieleniec] Precisely because we want to use this  opportunity  to emphasize contacts with Gulf countries. In principle, Kuwait  is very close to us. We have had intensive contacts since the  Gulf war, as well as rather good political, and particularly,  trade contacts, and for us Kuwait is a kind of gateway to this  region. As foreign minister, I must say that Kuwait's diplomacy  has always been very helpful in opening up new roads for us into  that area and, above all, has behaved always in a very friendly  manner toward us. These are the reasons we will make a stopover  there. We will also use this opportunity to have talks with the  highest representatives.</p>

			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / International Company News: Casio Computer slips to Y7.37bn Casio Computer, Japan's leading maker of digital watches, yesterday announced a 36.1 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the year ended March, but forecast a vigorous earnings rebound, reports William Dawkins from Tokyo. Pre-tax profits fell to Y7.37bn (Dollars 70.3m) last year on sales which fell by 1.3 per cent to Y322.22bn. Casio, which exports more than half its total sales, blamed its decline on the yen's sharp appreciation in value.</p>

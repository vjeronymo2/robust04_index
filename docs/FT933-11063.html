			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / EC rules 'do not cover pensions' A TEST case at the Employment Appeal Tribunal has established that pensions are not covered by the European Community directive that preserves the rights of employees when businesses change hands or work is contracted out. The case was over the pension rights of Mr Ernest Warrener, whose company changed hands in circumstances that were covered by the EC's Acquired Rights Directive 1977. The tribunal ruled that the new owner was not required to offer the same pension provisions to employees which they had enjoyed under their previous owner. The judgment was described as 'decisive' by Ms Melanie Tether, a partner of City solicitors Norton Rose. She said: 'The tribunal backs the government view that the directive protects only the accumulated rights of employees up to the time an undertaking is transferred.' This will come as a relief to contractors bidding for public-sector contracts, since pension provisions are often much more generous in the public sector. Last night Mr John Hall, director-general of the Cleaning and Support Services Association, said the judgment as 'very useful'. He said: 'It clears the air on one of the major issues hanging over the government's contracting-out programme.' However, a second test case completed yesterday at the tribunal confirmed that the directive can apply to contracting-out of public-sector services. In a judgment over a refuse collection contract in Eastbourne, East Sussex, the tribunal said that the pay and conditions of staff whose jobs are contracted out could be covered by the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) regulations 1981, which implemented the directive in UK law. This appears to confirm advice given by the government's law officers in the spring that recent cases in the European Court of Justice have widened the scope of the Tupe regulations to compulsory competitive tendering. Where the regulations apply, they protect the jobs and conditions of employment of the workforce when their jobs are transferred to another employer. However, the Eastbourne judgment was immediately greeted by Mr Jack Dromey of the TGWU general union as 'a historic verdict'. He invited the government to offer compensation to those who had lost their jobs or pay as a result of contracting out. Otherwise they would face thousands of claims for compensation for not properly implementing EC legislation.</p>

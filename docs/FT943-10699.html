			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: American General launches Dollars 2.6bn bid for Unitrin American General, the life insurance and financial services group, yesterday unveiled a hostile, Dollars 2.6bn cash bid for Unitrin, the health and property/casualty insurance group. The offer is the second big hostile bid in the US insurance industry this year, following an unsuccessful attempt by GE Capital to acquire Kemper earlier this year. American General said it had proposed three weeks ago paying Dollars 50 3/8 a share for Unitrin, but that its offer had been turned down by the company's board on July 26. It added that it might increase the offer if Unitrin could show it was worth more 'in the course of due diligence and negotiation'. Unitrin's shares closed at Dollars 39 3/4 yesterday, before the offer was disclosed. The announcement echoes the GE Capital bid for Kemper, which was only made public after Kemper had rebuffed a private offer. That announcement eventually flushed out a higher bid from Conseco, another insurance group. Unitrin, which last year had revenues of Dollars 1.3bn, was spun off from Teledyne, the manufacturing group, in 1990. American General said it believed the company, which has shareholders' capital of Dollars 2bn and assets of Dollars 4.8bn, was overcapitalised by Dollars 1.4bn. Releasing this capital would bring down the cost of the acquisition substantially. American General said its offer would be open until September 16.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Today Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said  the Greek position on Skopje's [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia--FYROM] name has been stated and the Greek Government  is not under any pressure. This was in reference to today's  press reports and to UN mediator Cyrus Vance's meeting with  Ambassador Khristos Zakharakis, the Foreign Ministry secretary  general. He said the government is talking with everyone who  has undertaken any initiative to resolve the issue and is  seeking solutions.    Venizelos reiterated that Greece remains firm in its  positions, and discussed the obvious U.S. interest toward a  Skopje solution.</p>

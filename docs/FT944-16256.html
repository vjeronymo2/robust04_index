			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / BNFL offer on nuclear waste Disposal of the UK's radioactive waste should be the responsibility of a single government organisation, says British Nuclear Fuels, the nuclear fuel reprocessing company. BNFL, in its submission to the government's review of radioactive waste policy, says this would be the most cost-effective way of dealing with the problem and offers itself for the part. It says: 'BNFL believes that we can, and should, play a major role in this area provided that it does not require us to accept risks which are incompatible with our commercial status.' BNFL supports the main proposals in the consultation document put out by the government in August, which favoured placing most of the UK's more radioactive waste underground. The company says, however, that it has the capacity to hold waste above ground for some years if deep disposal plans are put back. BNFL appeals to the government to pay attention to the costs of waste regulation so that its international competitiveness is not impaired. In another submission to the review the UK Atomic Energy Authority puts itself forward to manage the decommissioning of nuclear installations. Mr Derek Pooley, the chief executive, said this proposal would ensure decommissioning would be 'properly planned and co-ordinated over a long period'.</p>

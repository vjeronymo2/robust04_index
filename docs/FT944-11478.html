			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Advice to parents I have been helping my parents invest their offshore savings in such areas as equities, bonds and currencies although I have not been handling the funds or receiving any direct compensation for advice. Am I subject to regulation over this? And what if I started managing offshore funds for other members of my family but did get compensation for my efforts? Because you are not remunerated in any way and are simply advising members of your family, we do not believe that regulatory requirements apply to your situation. But it is essential that you do not offer financial advice to members of the public, whether for reward or not. (Murray Johnstone). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

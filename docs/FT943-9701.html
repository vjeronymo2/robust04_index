			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Belarus lifts some subsidies The Belarussian government has confirmed its sudden conversion to market reforms with a decision to lift subsidies on bread and milk. The move, which could lead to a tenfold price increase, suggests that President Alexander Lukashenko, once expected to adopt reactionary economic policies, was sincere in his post-election pledge to pursue reforms. Maintaining food subsidies has been a particularly costly choice because it has led to an exodus of goods from Belarus into neighbouring countries. Prime Minister Mikhail Chigir, the reformer whom Mr Lukashenko appointed shortly after his election last month, admitted that the leap in prices would cause hardship for Belarussians, but said that without price liberalisation other market reforms would be impossible. Russian conservatives had expected the new presidents of both Belarus and Ukraine to favour closer relations with Russia and a return to a centrally planned economy.</p>

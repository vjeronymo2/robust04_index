			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Marina Shakina, under the "Political Life" </F> rubric: "Will Valeriy Zorkin Become a Candidate for President?  Perhaps He Will Indeed Become a Candidate, but  President--Hardly"]    [Text] One of the most fascinating occupations engaged in  by people who take an interest in politics is calculating who  will attempt to become president in the next presidential  elections.    Recently, rumors have circulated that Ilya Konstantinov was  preparing to embark upon this arduous path and that he was  planning to take with him for company Valeriy Zorkin, former  chairman of the Constitutional Court.    The team of rivals inclined to fight for the presidency has  more or less been formed. The only ones who are still holding  back with their bids are the "die-hards"--Yeltsin, Gorbachev,  Chernomyrdin. But the rest are "pawing the ground." Yavlinskiy,  Zhirinovskiy, Shakhray, Rutskoy, Gaydar, Travkin.... Generally  speaking, one can put on the list any Russian politician who is  the slightest bit famous--you will not go wrong.    Judging by everything, at the presidential elections the  situation be a repeat of that before 12 December--no general  candidates, no one will yield to anyone and withdraw their  candidacy for the benefit of a more popular like-minded  candidate, everyone for himself. If there are many candidates,  that means that there is no generally accepted leader. If there  are many claimants, that means that there is not one, after all.  <H5>  His Favorite Clothing--the Peacemaker's Toga </H5>   Valeriy Zorkin is in an unusual position. He is one of the  few whose name is at this point not associated with one of the  parties, and not even with a political force. Although a fairly  wide spectrum of parties considers him one of their own. But  right now he is not interested in them, but on the contrary,  they in him.    During the period of the parliamentary election campaign, he  received offers to be entered on the election lists of Civic  Union, Aksyuchits' Christian-democratic movement, and the  Agrarian Party. But he, thanking everyone for the honor,  declined the offers, since he was still a member of the  Constitutional Court.    Today his name is being counted upon by Ilya Konstantinov,  who has been freed from Lefortovo and has conceived the plan to  resurrect the National Salvation Front. And in principle, this  fact evokes no surprise. If we recall the recent past, the  National Salvation Front should be experiencing a special  feeling of gratitude toward Valeriy Zorkin.    After all, in its time, the Constitutional Court, under  Zorkin's leadership, declared unconstitutional the edict of the  president that banned this same front. Of course, Zorkin  considers that this gratitude is inappropriate--he was only  carrying out his duty, checking the actions of the president  with the Constitution. But nevertheless, the front owes its  existence to the Constitutional Court and its former chairman.    Is Valeriy Zorkin himself up on these plans for the future?  He declares that he is not. "I am flattered, it is an honor for  me, that Konstantinov has raised me to his level.... But for me,  this is a complete surprise."    Of course, these self-abasing curtsies to Konstantinov and  his "level" should not be taken literally--Valeriy Zorkin is  simply a very well-bred and modest person. It seems to me that  he would answer any offer in this way, regardless from whom it  came. Or not?    Valeriy Zorkin was always not simply a jurist, not simply a  judge, not simply the chairman of the Constitutional Court, but  a man endowed with a political temperament. The role of the  chairman of the Constitutional Court, to which he came as a  result of purely political actions--an expert of the  Constitutional Commission, an elaborator of the law on the  Constitutional Court--was, as is now seen perfectly distinctly,  always perceived by him as a political post.  <H5>  The Judge of All </H5>   The thesis of the political sterility of constitutional  judges seemed to many a bit of craftiness about which it was  indecent to speak aloud. With tacit silence, everyone pretended  that, yes indeed, the court is outside of politics.    But admit it, if you become judge of the president and  of the deputies, if you have the right to tell the head of  state, "You are wrong," or if you do the same with regard to  those elected by the people, and if your decision is not subject  to discussion, then that elevates you in your own eyes and even  makes you sort of their equal. It is an insidious thing,  judging. How sweet for an untempered man....    Without a doubt, this role was very, very much to Valeriy  Zorkin's taste. He considered it his calling--not calling in our  everyday vernacular, which has lost its innermost, sacral sense  and signifies only a talent, an inclination for something. But  Calling with a capital C, that is, a concept from among the  class of divine categories, a manifestation of a higher will.    Valeriy Zorkin does not particularly conceal that he  believes  in divine providence and that today he has not drawn back from  politics but cocks his ear to fate. He is frozen in  expectation--how will his life be ordered?    It is partly from this--the man does not belong to himself  and does not himself choose a path for himself--that his passive  position also results. Zorkin considers it unacceptable to offer  himself and his name to various political forces and to engage  in trade with the aim of reaching the highest quotation of his  own political stock.    So, judging from everything, Zorkin perceived the role of  the  chairman of the Constitutional Court as a calling also to embody  a measure of morality in politics. He saw himself not as a  political leader, but as a spiritual one, as a person who shows  what is good and what is bad, with everyone hearkening to  him.... A judge and a spiritual authority are two incompatible  things. A spiritual leader is strong not in the lines of a  verdict, but in the entire scope of his personality.    It cannot be denied that Zorkin did not attempt--I do not  even know how to say this--to acquire, to play, to imitate this  scope of personality. In general, to be at the level of the  ideal that lived in his soul. But the results would hardly  convince even him himself. And he is hardly to blame for this.  <H5>  Piecemeal Centrism </H5>   The fact is that, for reasons of the most objective of  circumstances of political life, the perfectly honorable role of  peacemaker that he chose was an absolute failure. During  Zorkin's tenure as chairman of the Constitutional Court, events  developed according to a confrontational scenario, and not  because of the perniciousness of the interested parties  (although this was also present to a small degree), but by  virtue of the fact that the political opponents were striving  for opposite and incompatible things.    Even if civil peace was, at great effort, preserved, there  was no peace in hearts and minds. And there is none now. And to  represent the matter as such that we will take a little bit from  the leftists and a little bit from the rightists, and we will  have centrism and political splendor--that is either uncommon  naivete or conscious game-playing. Zorkin is not the only one  who has been caught up in this.    But it is not just that the role of peacemaker is not yet a  timely one in our country, and therefore, it cannot be crowned  with success. Zorkin was not even able to create the image of a  peacemaker.    Zorkin demonstrated exceeding verbosity, fussiness,  partiality, and involvement in conflict. He remained  simultaneously judge to the president and the deputies, judge to  himself, and a sort of head of a "quick reaction" corps in the  development of the political situation. And for that reason, he  very quickly began to be used toward political ends.    Contradictory ambition led to Zorkin's getting embroiled up  to his ears in political squabbles of the day, and he began to  play a strange role--something like a pawn in other people's  hands, something like a typical representative of the restless  intelligentsia, which is eternally afraid of everything, can  never decide to do anything, and strives to dump this decision  in someone else's lap.    The position of a peacemaker both before the referendum and  in October could have been the same--a call to all the  participating sides: "Refrain from violence at any cost." A  political peacemaker, a spiritual leader, even a simple  politician (but a politician!) should think about to  what, to which consequences, his decision, his word, his  action, will lead. A judge should not.    What am I leading up to? To the fact that Zorkin is not this  nor that nor the other--not a peacemaker, not a spiritual  leader, and not a politician. He is a very capable, qualified  jurist with a striking need for self-expression and  self-assertion. With certain huge ambitions that are eroded, not  concrete, but lying more in the realm of politics. Are these  ambitions fated to be realized? It would not seem so.  <H5>  Outside of Realism. That Is Typical </H5>   Why? The opinions of Valeriy Zorkin on politics create the  impression of being too banal, declarative, and abstract.    For example, Zorkin is convinced of the necessity for the  creation of a broad centrist coalition, which could include (if  we orient ourselves on the Duma factions) communists, agrarians,  a segment of Yavlinskiy's bloc, part of Shakhray's party, and  Travkin's party. And Baburin and his group, too. This coalition  will create a government that will lead the country out of the  blind alley into which it was led by Yeltsin, Gaydar, and their  like.    It is completely unnecessary to hand out posts to Travkin,  Lapshin, and Shakhray (who is not doing without as it is,  incidentally) in order to see that this will change nothing. In  this sense, Chernomyrdin's government is ideologically a  completely coalition one. It includes representatives of  Shakhray's party and of the agrarians and of the communists.    "If you promised the people something and you were not able  to come through, then retire, let someone else try," Zorkin says  to the democrats, forgetting that Gaydar has in fact left and  that everything that is happening today in the economy is  happening without his participation, and Yeltsin's term expires  only in 1996 and there is no reason for him to step down  sooner--even according to the Constitution, which we all, taking  our lead from the constitutional judges, honor.    And besides, it was precisely Yeltsin who formed the  currently working, essentially coalition government, of whose  necessity Gennadiy Zyuganov and Valeriy Zorkin are constantly  talking.    Valeriy Zorkin considers the main task of state power to be  the struggle against corruption, which the president has  promised to conduct; meanwhile, the corruption has not been done  away with.... Well, what can one say to that? That the coalition  government will not be able to do away with it either, and, in  order to be convinced of this there is no need to experiment  with ministers?    That we will not be able to triumph over corruption, but  only  to localize it, when a civil society, a stable multiparty  system, and an effective economy are created? And to "triumph  over" corruption is possible only with universal repressions,  and even then....    Finally, that it is not the president who fights corruption,  but the security organs, the procuracy, and the Ministry of  Internal Affairs, which are demonstrating no inclination to  engage seriously in this? Incidentally speaking, the security  organs, the procuracy, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs are  completely "coalition," because they are composed of those same  people who were there under Soviet power.  <H5>  There Are Also Those Who Are `More Ours' </H5>   The Constitutional Court now finds itself in a strange  position. The former law is not in effect, but the Duma is  wrapping up the draft of the new one with unmitigated  stubbornness. In the court, the matter is represented in such a  way that neither the president nor the deputies need the  Constitutional Court--it will just get underfoot in the coming  slingfest.    Valeriy Zorkin, however, acknowledges that "while the  volcano  continues to erupt," perhaps there really is no sense in the  Constitutional Court's beginning to work--the legal grounds have  not yet become set, one edict supersedes another, and the Duma  still has not managed to adopt a single law, and therefore ought  to feel uncomfortable in front of the Constitutional Court.    Will he be able to satisfy his thirst for self-realization  in  such a court? And the answer suggests itself of its own accord:  No. Most likely, he will also not be able to withdraw into the  quiet of a judge's chambers. And he himself will not be able to.    Zorkin does not want to guess at future events. But, most  likely, his name will be uttered more than once toward the  presidential and parliamentary elections. He hardly has a  serious chance at the presidency--one would think that he is an  intelligent person and understands that himself, although  perhaps in his heart he cannot agree with such a fate.    The voters are unlikely to evaluate his moral castings in  the  field of politics--for many people, after his chairman's epic he  is "neither fish nor fowl" and you cannot figure out what he  wants; for others, he is an apostate; for others, maybe he is in  fact "one of ours," but there are those who are "more ours."    But Zorkin could perfectly well become an independent and  fairly influential deputy. If that will satisfy him.</p>

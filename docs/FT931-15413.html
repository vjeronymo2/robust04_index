			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Observer: Wall Street kite-flying Well, well. According to the Wall Street rumour mill, Salomon Bros may rehire John Meriwether, a former vice-chairman and legendary bond-trader, sacked in 1991 as part of the management shake-up in the wake of the US Treasury auction 'irregularities'. Neither Salomon nor Meriwether is commenting, but it is believed the firm's hugely successful group of bond-traders and arbitrageurs, who generated several billion dollars in revenue for Salomon last year, are lobbying for his return. Their case is easy to understand. Salomon is first and foremost a bond-trader and if someone of Meriwether's talents, and popularity, were to pop up on the other side of Wall Street, it could be bad for business. Although Meriwether was fined and suspended from the securities business for three months by the SEC for failing to supervise properly the trader who submitted false bids in the 1991 treasury bond auctions, it is argued that he had little to do with the events that led to the scandal. His only fault was his naivety, say his fans. There is one formidable obstacle to his return, however, in the shape of Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor who cleaned up Salomon in the immediate aftermath of the scandal. Perhaps he's going soft. But it's hard to believe that he would want to see such a highly visible symbol of Salomon's much-criticised past rejoining the firm.</p>

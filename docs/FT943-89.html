			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries fall on further signs of economic strength US Treasury bonds fell sharply again yesterday as traders reacted to further signs of economic strength. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  5/16 lower at 96 1/32 , with the yield rising to 7.839 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was down  1/8 at 99 27/32 , to yield 6.568 per cent. The downturn followed the release of another set of data which could bring forward the next increase in short-term interest rates. With the Federal Reserve believed to be poised to tighten monetary policy again, the Commerce Department reported that new home sales had jumped by 9.7 per cent last month to an annual rate of 703,000, against an adjusted July pace of 641,000. Separately, it revised its estimate of second-quarter gross domestic product up to 4.1 per cent, from 3.8 per cent. The readings bode poorly for the next round of first-tier reports, which may confirm that the economy is still accelerating. The market is also growing anxious about the dollar, as the deadline for completing US-Japanese trade negotiations draws closer. Bond traders were disturbed after hearing of comments by Mr Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute of International Economics. Mr Bergsten said the dollar could fall sharply against the yen if the talks collapse and the Clinton administration follows through on threats to impose retaliatory sanctions. Meanwhile, a weaker dollar could aggravate inflation by making imports more expensive. That trend was evident in yesterday's news that import prices climbed 0.6 per cent in August, while export prices were up 0.2 per cent. Amid these concerns, the yield on the long bond touched its highest level of the year at 7.87 per cent, but later it receded as the price climbed off the session low. European government bond markets dipped yesterday, pulled down by the US Treasury market. The Bundesbank council's decision yesterday to leave key German interest rates unaltered was widely expected. UK gilt prices slipped slightly in slow trading. Mr Ian Shepherdson, UK economist at Midland Global Markets, said: 'It is a very quiet day - there is no news to move the market.' One feature which prompted some comment was the price at which a tranche of stock was removed from the market. The tranche, Pounds 150m of 2 1/2 per cent index-linked bonds due 2016, was sold at 137 1/8 . Some analysts pointed out that this was  1/16 points above the price in the market. Another Pounds 100m tranche of 2 per cent index-linked stock due 2006 was sold around the market price of 167 1/16 . The tranches were announced on August 25. This week's 8 1/2 per cent due 2005 auction stock fell from around 97 5/8 to around 97 17/32 , to yield 8.83 per cent, a rise in yield of around 3 basis points. German bunds drifted through the morning and followed US Treasuries down in the afternoon, with the December bund future around 89.22 in late trading, down 0.35 points. According to Mr Christoph Anhamm, a bond analyst at Union Bank of Switzerland in Frankfurt: 'The market is likely to continue in range-bound trading. Investors are waiting for the result of the election on October 16. Until then, sentiment will be very fragile.' Mr Anhamm pointed out that, while around a week ago the yield on the 10-year German bund was about 30 basis points above that of the comparable US Treasury, by yesterday it had moved to about 20 basis points below. 'Investors may have realised that the central banks are going in different directions,' he added.</p>

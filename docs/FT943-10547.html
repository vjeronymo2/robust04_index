			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Observer: Dorrell's delight Stephen Dorrell, Britain's new National Heritage supremo, may not know much about art, but that need not stop him winning the plaudits of the arts world. Tomorrow the deadline expires on the attempt to find the Pounds 7.6m needed to keep Canova's statue of The Three Graces in the UK and out of the clutches of the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, California. The cause seems hopeless. The V&amp;A, which is spearheading the rescue mission, has only managed to raise Pounds 4.7m. But now Dorrell wants to re-examine the papers and has postponed an announcement until Monday. He could delay the export licence for another three months, but there is also a chance that he has found a white knight with the necessary millions. One possibility is the incredibly generous cricket fan, J. Paul Getty Jnr, who has little love for his father's memorial. But if The Three Graces is saved, some of the kudos will rub off on Dorrell as well.</p>

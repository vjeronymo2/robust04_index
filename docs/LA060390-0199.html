			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TAXING THE CABLE TV COMPANIES  </P> <P> Cable television companies should be taxed on the same basis as other  franchised operations such as the phone company, the power company and the gas  company. These organizations pay franchise fees to do business in their  respective areas.  </P> <P> The phone, electric and cable TV all use similar equipment and, in many cases,  occupy joint facilities both overhead on poles and underground.  </P> <P> Taxes should be based on physical plants and not "good will" or any other  indeterminate factor.  </P> <P> If our tax assessor proceeds with his apparent plans for "phantom taxes," he'd  better be ready to use the same assessment on other franchised operations!  </P> <P> Actually this whole thing reeks of another attempted end run around Proposition  13!  </P> <P> Whatever taxes may be assessed will be passed right on through to the  consumers, so who's kidding whom?  </P> <P> AUDIE ASHCRAFT  </P> <P> Cypress  </P></p>

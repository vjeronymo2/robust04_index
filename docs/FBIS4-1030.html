			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jan Taljaard] </F>   [Text] The Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [Resistance  Movement -- AWB] is gearing up for a last stand in parts of the  Transvaal. In anticipation of armed conflict, AWB members' wives  and children were last week sent to "safe havens" on farms in  the Eastern Transvaal.    Apart from stockpiling food, other signs of preparations for  war include the purchase by rightwingers of at least 30 Saracen  armoured vehicles at SADF [South African Defense Force] auctions  over the last month. Sources said the AWB's plans centred on a  "mini-secession" of certain towns in the Western Transvaal --  including Ottosdal and Schweizer-Reneke, which in recent months  granted their "freedom" to the para-military AWB Wenkommando  [Victory Commando].    Other sources said there were indications that parts of the  Eastern Transvaal and Pretoria could be simultaneously declared  "independent in the week before the election. The AWB allegedly  has plans to blockade the towns to make the election impossible  in these areas. Although it is envisaged the secessions will be  achieved peacefully, sources close to the AWB fear that it will  provoke the SADF and black inhabitants of the towns to react.    Some are pinning their hopes on KwaZulu/Natal erupting into  anarchy and tying down the security forces to the extent that  they will not be able to act in the Western Transvaal. Three  rightwing sources said that women and children have been sent to  "safe havens" on Eastern Transvaal farms. Of the Saracen  armoured vehicles bought over the past month, a [Orange] Free  State rightwinger has bought two, while parties linked to the  Pretoria Boerehommando [Boer commando] Group and the Akasia Town  Council have also shown interest.</p>

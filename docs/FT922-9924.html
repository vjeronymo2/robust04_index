			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Leading candidates set for more poll victories PRESIDENT George Bush and Governor Bill Clinton seem set to win substantial, three-state victories today in their parties' primaries. Just as in Pennsylvania's primary last week, today's votes in North Carolina, Indiana and the District of Columbia have generated little heat. Mr Bush has formally wrapped up his party's nomination, and Mr Clinton, who has already won more than 70 per cent of the delegates he needs, is now behaving as the Democrats' de facto nominee. This robs their two surviving challengers  - Mr Pat Buchanan, the right-wing television commentator, for the Republicans, and Mr Jerry Brown, the former governor of California, for the Democrats  - of any realistic claim to be still in contention. Mr Buchanan is staging his last stand in North Carolina, hoping to embarrass Mr Bush by at least partially emulating the 1976 success of Mr Ronald Reagan against incumbent President Gerald Ford. North Carolina boasts a large body of conservative voters who have consistently re-elected Senator Jesse Helms  - possibly the most right-wing senator  - but Mr Helms has backed Mr Bush, although with little evident relish. On the Democratic side, Mr Brown seems unlikely to make much of a dent in Mr Clinton's ability to garner votes in the south; and opinion polls suggest he will not fare much better in Indiana or the District of Columbia. Recent polls show Mr Clinton winning 60 per cent of the Democratic vote in North Carolina, against Mr Brown's 13 per cent, and 55 per cent in Indiana compared with Mr Brown's 15 per cent. At the weekend Mr Clinton also picked up delegates from caucus votes and party conventions in Guam, Texas and Missouri. But the same polls suggested that Mr Clinton would come in third in both states in a three-candidate general election against President Bush and Mr Ross Perot, the Texas businessman who is seeking to enter the election as an independent candidate. Mr Perot yesterday urged caution in accepting a free-trade agreement with Mexico, Reuter adds from San Antonio, Texas. He said the US was in a vulnerable position. 'Just to suddenly throw the doors open will really wipe out the jobs of millions of people in this country,' he said.</p>

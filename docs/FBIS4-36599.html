			<p>BFN     [Text] The United Nations has announced the postponement of  the voter identification operation with regard to the  self-determination referendum in Western Sahara. Our  correspondent has more details:    [Unidentified correspondent] Voter identification for those  who are to take part in the self-determination referendum in  Western Sahara, which was supposed to begin today in Laayoune,  has been postponed until next week for logistical reasons. The  United Nations announced the news from Rabat today, confirming  that the transportation of Moroccan and Saharan notables to  registration locations raised some technical problems.    According to a UN-Moroccan joint statement signed at the end  of May in Rabat by the Moroccan interior minister and Erik  Jenssen, acting special envoy of the UN secretary general, all  Saharans concerned with the referendum had been informed that  voter identification would begin today in Laayoune.</p>

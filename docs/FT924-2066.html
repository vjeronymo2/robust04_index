			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Need for friendly giant Two years of buttering up Chancellor Helmut Kohl paid dividends for Mr John Major at the weekend. Now he must labour mightily, and perhaps for as long, to achieve a good personal rapport with Mr Bill Clinton. The prime minister is surely aware of this. His aim must be to establish as profitable a working relationship with Washington as the one he has with Bonn. A medium-sized nation such as Britain needs the friendship of both giants, one for its economic influence within Europe, the other because it is the only superpower. Mr Major worked hard for success at the European summit in Edinburgh. His well-known negotiating skills were effectively deployed. His attention to detail and his mastery of a complicated brief have been rightly praised. Yet without German support all that effort might have been in vain. One day - no one can tell when - the prime minister will need US understanding as badly as he required that of Germany on Friday and Saturday. Until now it has usually been possible to count on an amicable President George Bush. That helped Number 10 Downing Street play an important part in salvaging the Gatt negotiations just a few weeks ago. Mr Major spoke as president of the European Council, but his voice was that of a dependable ally. When former President Ronald Reagan and Lady Thatcher were both in office, the link was telepathic. When Mr Major wishes to talk to Mr Bush, the Oval Room, like Mr Kohl's office, is only a telephone call away. The arrival in the White House next month of a completely new man - a favourite of the 1960s generation and a Democrat - puts a question mark over all that. Washington can no longer be taken for granted. Mr Major must earn Mr Clinton's trust. The courtship will not be easy, or quick. It starts with an embarrassed shuffling of feet as memories of the role played by the Conservative party in Mr Bush's campaign (and Labour in Mr Clinton's) are allowed to fade. This is good dirty fun, but it is not the essence of the matter. Mr Clinton sought out Sir Robin Renwick, the British ambassador, at a glittering party thrown by Mrs Kay Graham in Washington last week. Perhaps this was a pay-off for half a year of persistent, and characteristic, precautionary burrowing into the Democratic camp undertaken by the ambassador and his staff. The president-elect assured Sir Robin that no insult was intended by his inability to find time to see Mr Major when he visits the US later this week. Surely not, but Mr Clinton's diary is a reminder that his priority is management of the domestic economy. A page on which to write the word 'Britain' has not yet been found. Mr Major's priority is his policy for western Europe. I trust that, for him, the word 'America' is on page one of 1993. The shift of emphasis in both Washington and London away from the transatlantic link makes the re-establishment of a strong relationship difficult. This loosening of ties was bound to happen. The cold war is over. Before the Berlin Wall came down, western diplomats and military planners could tell themselves that they were all working within the same global framework. That sense of grand strategy has gone. Officials around Lady Thatcher and President Reagan could hum the same tunes because they thought alike. There is no such natural harmony today. There will be even less after January 20, when the new president takes over. Some old hands argue that Mr Clinton will soon see the need for a practical alliance with Britain. The United Kingdom is a nuclear power, a permanent member of the Security Council, a potentially useful provider of military bases, a brother in the intelligence family. New international crises will present themselves. Russian policy cannot be foretold. President Saddam Hussein is still in control of Iraq. The politics of trade negotiations is continuous. The war in former Yugoslavia is exploding right now. The new president will have to decide how to handle such matters - when he eventually gets around to foreign policy. His natural instinct may be to deal with western Europe as a region and the EC as its local organisation. Against that must be set growing US irritation at the Europeans' failure to respond to the needs of Bosnia. I would also be irritated, were I an American, by the knee-jerk anti-Yankee response to the intervention in Somalia. President Bush's motives may be impure, but tell that to a starving child. What Mr Major has to do first is ascertain just how responsive to calls the new Uncle Sam is going to be. Europeans in general, and the French in particular, like to proclaim the EC as an alternative superpower, but go running to the real one whenever serious money, or action, is called for. British Conservatives do not, by and large, fall into this trap. They know where the centre of military power lies, and seek to work with it. This ancient process may not be so simple with Mr Clinton in the White House.</p>

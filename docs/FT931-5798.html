			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Accountancy Column: Measuring earnings after FRS3 - Analysts seek a standardised view of company performance The Institute of Investment Management and Research, formerly the Society of Investment Analysts, has published an Exposure Draft proposing a standardised treatment of a company's trading earnings for use by analysts, commentators and other observers. A shortened version of the paper follows: THE first sentence of paragraph 52 of FRS3 states 'It is not possible to distill the performance of a complex organisation into a single measure'. This is manifestly true. The performance of a company is reflected in a complex and interlocking set of figures, which themselves interrelate with the industry and economy. If FRS3 can begin to unravel the myth that a single number determines share prices, a considerable step forward will have been taken. Nevertheless, there are several reasons why efforts should be made to delineate some clearly acceptable earnings figure (or figures). First, in evaluating a company the stock market must order published information in some useful way. If this is so, it would be desirable that the information should as far as possible be ordered in that way in the calculations of earnings. Second, there are a large number of users of accounts who do not have the time or the expertise to make the detailed investigations which are distilled into the final market price. Whatever other requirement there may be for an earnings figure it is clearly desirable, indeed virtually necessary, to define a figure for the company's earnings for the year which can be used as an unambiguous reference point between users, the press, the statistical services, etc. This raises the possibility that such a figure should also be used in preliminary and interim announcements as a statement of earnings, and how they compare with the previous year. The figure - to be known as IIMR headline earnings - should for these purposes have certain characteristics. First, it should be a measure of the company's trading performance in the year, not confused with capital items. Second, it should as far as possible be robust. That is, the calculation should be one that can be carried through by anyone presented with the building blocks of the calculation. Third, the figure should be factual, including incomes and costs which actually occurred. However, headline earnings, because they robustly and factually represent the past, will not necessarily be the best basis for forecasts of future earnings. Such forecasts require a great deal of judgment and this is where individual analysts or research firms can add value on behalf of their clients. The practical usefulness of the headline earnings figure is, however, its justification. No one earnings figure can do everything. These considerations lead to a standard definition of the headline earnings, calculated for the purposes set out above. It is intended as an additional figure, which can be reconciled to FRS3 figures subject to the points discussed below. (see table). The guiding principles follow. All the trading profits and losses of the company for the year (including interest) should be included in the earnings number. Items which are abnormal in size or nature are included. Profits and losses on the sale of fixed assets or of businesses should be excluded. This does not apply to assets acquired for resale. Profit and losses arising in activities discontinued at some point during the year, or in activities acquired at some point during the year, should remain in the earnings figure. The costs of eliminating a discontinued operation, or making an acquisition, and the profits and losses on any disposals, should be excluded. Prior period items, and the effect of changes in accounting policies and of past fundamental accounting errors should not affect the current year's calculation of earnings. Goodwill should not affect earnings in any way. Variations in pension fund contributions (and other post-retirement benefit provisions if any) should be included in earnings, but prominently displayed if of significant size. Capital and trading items which arise in currencies other than the reporting currency should be handled in the same way as the equivalent items arising in the domestic currency. The calculation of the headline earnings number should include tax adjustments to reflect the fact that certain items are excluded from the headline figure. Apart from these adjustments, the calculation of headline earnings should normally reflect the tax charge as shown in the company accounts. Companies should be encouraged to ensure that adequate disclosures are made to enable the effect of minority interests to be calculated on any adjustments that may be made to arrive at the headline figure if these are not already required. The definition of earnings. Exposure Draft published by the Institute of Investment Management and Research, 211-213 High St Bromley, Kent BR1 1NY.

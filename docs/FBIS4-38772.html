			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Potemkin report: "Turks Love Ukrainian Flounder"] </F>   [Text] An unusual procession appeared in the roads of the  port of Odessa early in the morning of 28 May -- the border  vessel P. Derzhavin towing a bright red Turkish fishing  schooner. The fishermen, who had full black moustaches, were  resignedly sunning themselves, lounging on coils of nets. A  mountain of fish, protected from the sun by a covering of straw,  rose up in the middle of the schooner. The border guards had  marked their professional day (which, by the way, is not  officially celebrated in Ukraine) by arresting the first  violator of the economic border since 1991.    The great power has collapsed. We can't even sort out our  internal borders, let alone the external ones: The Japanese  pilfer the sea stock off Sakhalin while the Turks run the show  in the Black Sea, treating it as if it were their own little  pond.    "The Turks know that we don't have enough fuel or seaworthy  ships to patrol and so they become brazen," Captain Third Rank  Grigoriy Zubov, deputy chief of the border brigade, told me.  "Then fuel appeared. We make our first trip out and come back  with a `catch'."    There are a lot of fish in the coastal waters today. The  economic crisis has helped: The kolkhozes have no money to buy  toxic chemicals, which the rain later washes out to sea, while  the industrial giants and heat and electric power stations,  which polluted the water with their discharges, are idle. And  so flounders, beluga, and mullet are returning to their native  coastal waters. While Turkish schooners, having laid in  kilometers of netting, sail in pursuit of them.    The poaching by the schooner Mekke [name as transliterated]  in the Black Sea's coastal waters is not the first documented  case of violation of the country's maritime area this year. At  the beginning of May, a fleet of 24 Turkish ships essentially  blocked off the spawning routes of the flounder with their nets  in the Skadovsk area. A small fisheries protection vessel which  went out to investigate the violation was attacked by the Turks.  Border guard vessels summoned from Balaklava and Odessa to  seize the foreign fishermen were unable to do so, as the latter  escaped into neutral waters.    This time the border guard vessel spotted the poachers'  marker buoys east of the island of Zmeinyy. It was immediately  obvious that they were not local fishermen's nets: Under  Ukrainian legislation, it is forbidden to take flounders in the  Black Sea; this fish was on the verge of extinction until quite  recently. After a while the owner of the nets -- a Turkish  schooner, calmly making its way towards its haul -- appeared.    It transpired that the Turks were using around 3 kilometers  of net, in which 740 flounder, beluga, dogfish, and skate  quivered. More than 20 dolphin caught up in the net suffocated  to death. The damage caused to the Black Sea's ecology, even at  modest Ukrainian prices, comes to several thousand dollars.    Estura Bogadina [names as transliterated], the captain and  owner of the schooner Mekke, now awaits trial in Odessa. The  vessel and nets will remain in the port of Odessa until a fine  is paid.</p>

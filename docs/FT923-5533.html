			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Private View: The eclipse of the British boffin - Science has lost its appeal. David Attenborough is campaigning to restore its image with children and politicians for money, status, everything - they could not have invented a better advocate than Sir David Attenborough, the television naturalist. Last week we learned that although the number of schoolchildren in England and Wales doing pre-university A levels went up, the number choosing science or mathematics fell yet again. Why? A year ago, taking up his 12-month presidency of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, Sir David looked at the opinion polls and concluded that the public regards science as difficult, dull and dangerous. Again, why? A generation ago, the young bloods of Oxbridge looked contemptuously on science students as boring people in duffle-coats. Is Britain paying now for their contempt? It was not just for his answers that I went to see David Attenborough this week, but to find out if they are the right questions to ask. I met him at the British Association's science festival in Southampton University. 'Festival' is not the word I should have chosen to describe the scene. The buildings were tatty; the place reeked of penny-pinching and stale sweat. There was nothing to catch the eye or lift the spirit. If this was the public face of British science, I thought, it does have problems. Sir David, by contrast, was as buoyant and engaging as his television alter ego. He wears his dozen medals and 17 honorary degrees lightly, looks much too young for 66 and exudes the kind of animal health which can only come from a lifetime of swinging from trees. I asked him first about education. 'What is really mysterious is that all children, I'm absolutely convinced, are interested in finding out about the world around them. That's simply another name for science. The question is, why does the educational system or parental system or whatever beat that out of them?' There cannot be a primary school child in the country, I agreed, who is not a militant saver of whales and protector of rainforests. So what happens to them? 'Schools start off doing a great job,' he said. 'But when the children reach 13 or 14 and think about earning a living they see there aren't many straightforward science jobs. Then there is the difficulty of science exams. Other courses are a softer touch.' It is easy to see in the so-called 'holistic' creed of the New Agers another symptom of anti-science: here are people who condemn science because they fear it, and fear it because they do not understand it. I asked Sir David if he blamed a lack of scholastic discipline - were children just no longer prepared to sit down and learn chemical formulae? 'But you could say the same about French irregular verbs,' he retorted. In Attenborough's case childish curiosity - he was a collector of fossils - developed into an enviable career (though he says he is not a real scientist). He grew up in Leicester, where his father, a university don in Anglo-Saxon, taught him that the way to learn was to find out for himself. By coincidence, the British association also played a part. Its 1933 conference was held in Leicester and Attenborough, aged seven, fell under the spell of the then president of the Association, the Nobel laureate Sir Frederick Gowland Hopkins, the biochemist who pioneered research into vitamins. Sir David talked, predictably, about the lack of jobs, government underfunding of the universities and the enormous cost of basic research - a cost which few companies could justify to their shareholders. We discussed the brain drain, Nobel prizewinners, national prosperity and the Japanese. It was when I suggested that Britain's decline - in science, as in engineering and manufacturing - was historically inevitable and we should not make a fuss about it that he came up with what seemed to me the best case of all. 'Science is an all-pervasive philosophy and body of knowledge which is necessary if we are to understand what goes on in society,' he said. 'To be high-flown for a bit: we are all in a democratic society. We are all asked to take decisions which really require some understanding of science as well as coping with daily life in our our high-tech society. 'In my field - conservation and so on - we are asked to make decisions about what our government should do about biodiversity, for example. Everyone gets frightfully steamed up about what biodiversity means. If you're going to urge ministers to do something, you ought to have some basic idea of what you're on about.' Energy generation was another subject the electorate could not afford to remain ignorant about. 'Here's another enormous problem, the nature of the dangers involved in nuclear power stations and how they compare with the dangers of using fossil fuels. 'And on top of the whole damn thing, as far as I'm concerned, there is the fact that an understanding of science illuminates your life. It makes it richer. It is a kind of cultural appetite which is just as valid as an appetite for opera.' But if it is so exciting and illuminating why doesn't the Establishment like it more? Why do they go to the opera? 'It's not mutually exclusive.' But why isn't it chic to be scientifically literate? 'Ah, well, that's what we're complaining about. Why that is so, I don't know. There is a certain time lag in civilisation, it seems to me. I think a lot of the trouble comes from 50 years ago. 'Fifty years ago, when the war was on, science was the great thing that was going to solve all the problems. And we poured huge sums of money into it. In the newsreels and feature films there was always this man in the white lab coat mixing with the men in gold-braided uniforms. He was the boffin. And it was of the essence of what the boffin did that it was secret, and not for the likes of you and me. 'And of course the government was right because in the war they did produce the answers, most spectacularly with the Bomb. 'Then everyone said: 'Right, that's great] Now we've got all this scientific endeavour, all our problems are over. We've got unlimited power from the atom bomb, the discovery of antibiotics means all diseases are going to be cleared up. The world is our oyster.' 'And what happened? The insecticides which were going to quadruple the output of our fields proved to have poisons which lingered in the ecosystem. Atomic power proved much more expensive and hazardous than we thought. We still haven't found a cure for cancer. 'So everyone said: 'See, there you are, science is bloody hopeless. It makes these great promises, fails to deliver and even when it does deliver the handicaps are disastrous.' 'It's because scientific education has not kept up with these things that people are left with the feeling that the magic tricks no longer work.' Could our lack of scientific education be fatal to us as a species? Sir David laughed cheerfully. 'Well, that's pushing it a bit. I think we will muddle through. What I do think is that it would lead to a society which is unaware of the basis on which it operates: and if you think that society ought to be a democratic one then you're certainly heading for trouble.' CORRECTION: Last week's headline stated that Michael Dummett, Wykeham professor of logic at Oxford, 'believes in' the Tarot. As the text made clear, the professor is an expert on the game of Tarot, not a believer in the occult.</p>

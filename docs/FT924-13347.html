			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Jobless rise fuels concern over economy CRITICISM OF the government's handling of the economy grew louder yesterday as a sharp drop in consumer confidence and another big rise in unemployment dimmed prospects for an economic recovery. Official figures showed that the number of people unemployed and claiming benefits rose by 32,200 last month to a five-year high of 2.84m, leaving one in 10 of the labour force out of work. Accelerating unemployment growth and a steep drop in Jobcentre vacancies indicated that further sharp rises in the unemployed total are likely before the end of the year. The cabinet gave no response to the figures after meeting to discuss public spending yesterday but the government came under renewed attack from backbenchers, business and industry. Consumer confidence has also continued the decline that began shortly after Mr John Major's April election victory. A Gallup survey, carried out before the government's announcement on Monday of plans to shut 31 mines, found that more than half of Britons expect the economic situation to deteriorate during the next 12 months while only a sixth expect it to improve. This was the gloomiest finding for at least five years. In London the news that the unemployment rate had reached 10.1 per cent helped push the pound down nearly four pfennigs to DM2.462, while in New York it was quoted at DM2.461 at the close. The deteriorating economic picture in the UK is being increasingly cited by foreign investors as a reason for sterling's weakness on the foreign exchanges. The FT-SE Index of 100 leading shares closed down 28.1 at 2,546.6 as the government's apparent reluctance to cut base rates, currently at 9 per cent, depressed UK equities. Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, said she was 'deeply concerned about the personal hardship of unemployed people and their families' but said the latest rise in the jobless total reflected world economic circumstances. Unemployment in the UK has now risen by 78 per cent, or 1.25m people, since the figures started to rise more than two years ago. The latest increase took seasonally-adjusted male unemployment to 13.4 per cent, the highest rate since records began in May 1986. Recent announcements of job losses - particularly from the coal industry - suggest that the rate of growth in unemployment is unlikely to slow before the end of the year. Last month's 11 per cent fall in job vacancies also pointed to a gloomy outlook. Mr Frank Dobson, shadow employment secretary, said: 'The worst is yet to come - that's the bleak message from these figures.' Conservative backbenchers stepped up their criticism of the government's handling of the economy. Mr John Butcher, MP for Coventry SW, and a former minister, said all economic indicators were 'screaming for a reduction in interest rates'.

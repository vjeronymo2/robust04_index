			<p>BFN     [Text] Since January, the Central Region Oil Drilling and  Extraction enterprise has delivered more than 385,000 tons of  oil, thus surpassing its projected goals by 3 percent. The  enterprise director, Engineer Marcos Aguilera, told national  reporters that the workers' efforts were paired with positive  results from foreign companies in charge of exploiting several  wells and the regular arrival of tankers.    Engineer Aguilera added that the current situation allows us  to believe that this overage can be maintained or surpasssed by  the end of the first semester, at which time they expect to have  extracted 410,870 tons.</p>

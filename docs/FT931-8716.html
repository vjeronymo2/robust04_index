			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Canada warned on government borrowing risk CANADIAN economists have warned that foreign investors are nearing the limit of their willingness to satisfy increasingly heavy borrowing by the federal government and 10 provinces. In one of the biggest recent borrowing onslaughts, Ottawa and the provinces have flooded domestic and international markets with new debt issues to finance soaring budget deficits. Growing Canadian public-sector debt has been reflected in a widening gap between Canadian and US interest rates, and bond yields, in the last six months and, more recently, in increased volatility of the Canadian dollar. The risks were outlined in a report by the CD Howe Institute of Toronto, a leading economic think-tank, following a recent seminar attended by 20 economists, most of them employed by banks and securities firms. Mr Ed Neufeld, chief economist of the Royal Bank of Canada, said that finance ministers should distinguish between short-term cyclical budget deficits and 'structural issues'. The economists urged measures to improve fiscal imbalances, ranging from deep cuts in transfer payments to the provinces to the elimination of overlapping government services. However, they had little enthusiasm for large tax increases. The warning coincides with growing political awareness of the risks posed by fast-growing budget deficits, especially in the provinces. Tax increases and public-spending cuts are expected to be a feature of the spring budget season. The provinces raised more than CDollars 10bn (Pounds 5.6bn) in debt in January, including a CDollars 3bn global Euromarkets issue by Ontario. Quebec earlier this week raised CDollars 1.4bn in its first global offering. The recession has badly dented tax revenues at all levels of government and put heavier demands on Canada's generous social security system. Mr Donald Mazankowksi, finance minister, last December revised the federal government's 1992-1993 budget deficit upwards from CDollars 27.5bn to CDollars 34.4bn. Ontario's shortfall is now projected at almost CDollars 11bn, three times the level two years ago. The combined debt of Ottawa and the provinces has soared from CDollars 50bn, or 29 per cent of gross domestic product, in 1975, to CDollars 665bn, or 96 per cent of GDP. Canada's foreign debt-service burden relative to the size of its economy is now higher than that of Chile and Venezuela, and approaching the levels of Brazil and Mexico. Mr Peter Nicholson, of Bank of Nova Scotia, said: 'There is a limit for tolerance of even greater Canadian debt in foreign markets. This limit is likely to be reached suddenly and without a lot of warning.' Other participants at the seminar said the federal election later this year or political uncertainty in Quebec might reduce appetite for Canadian loans. But a government-finance specialist at one Toronto securities firm said yesterday that there was no sign yet of foreigners shunning Canadian government debt issues.</p>

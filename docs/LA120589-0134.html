			<p><P> December 5, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOW TO DISCREDIT YOUR CAUSE  </P> <P> The vandalism of four Roman Catholic Churches, ostensibly the work of those  angry with the official position of the church on prevention of AIDS, is  deplorable. So was the assault earlier on Los Angeles County property by  so-called AIDS activists who judged the county's response to the epidemic  inadequate.  </P> <P> The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic, in its cruel spread of AIDS,  is violence enough. The solution will not be facilitated by compounding the  cruelty.  </P> <P> Those who vandalized the churches by smearing their exteriors with red paint  left behind posters attacking the recent declaration of the National Conference  of Catholic Bishops on the HIV epidemic. The bishops have been resolute in  their expressions of compassion for the victims of the disease. But they have  chosen to oppose the use of condoms, which most public health experts regards  crucial to reducing the spread of the virus in a society where sexual  promiscuity is widespread. We disagree with the bishops' prescription for the  public as a whole. We must respect, however, their right to insist to their own  members that sex be limited to a man and woman bound in marriage.  </P> <P> There are adequate and appropriate forums for free expression of disparate  points of view in the United States on this and other controversial issues.  There have been dignified and peaceful demonstrations in the past protesting  the position of the Roman Catholic Church on AIDS prevention. The resort to  violence against church property impoverishes freedom and discredits its  perpetrators. It risks diverting the community from its efforts to contain the  disease at the moment when the only tools of containment are educating sexually  active persons on the means of prevention.  </P></p>

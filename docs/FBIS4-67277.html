			<p>Customs   Employee   <F P=102> 94P30052B </F> <F P=103> 94P30052B </F> <F P=104></F>    CSO     [Editorial Report] The daily PUSAN ILBO's 30 March 1994  edition on page 23 carried a report that the office of the Pusan  District Prosecutor arrested six philopon [crystal  methamphetamine] smugglers, including an overseas  Chinese-Korean, Wang Chin-saeng, who is employed by Kimpo  Airport Customs as an interpreter. Chong Yong-sok and Kim  Kil-tae were among the six arrested.    According to the prosecutor's office, the leader, Chong  Yong-sok, paid Wang four million won [approximately U.S.  $50,000] to accompany Chong and Kim Kil-tae to Taipei, Taiwan  and interpret for them. Chong purchased one kilogram of  philopon for five billion won [approximately U.S. $6.25 million]  in Taipei and returned to Korea through Kimpo International with  the drug concealed in the clothes Kim was wearing.    The smugglers were arrested on 28 March while they were  contacting drug dealers in the Namdaemun market areas in Seoul.  The one kilogram of philopon was seized as evidence when they  were arrested.    Along with scrutinizing the background of Chong's drug  business, the prosecutor's office has expanded the investigation  because of Wang's involvement. The investigators are looking  into the customs office and its employees for possible  involvement in drug trafficking.</p>

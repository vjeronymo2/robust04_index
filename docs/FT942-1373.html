			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Now who's huffing? Sir, I refer to your sports columnist Laura Thompson's article on May 23, the subject being the apparent English relief at their non-qualification for the World Cup. In particular, I quote: '. . . to watch poor old Ireland huff and puff against the runny, ice cream-fluidity of the Italians . . .' Following the brilliant performance of Jack Charlton's 'poor old Ireland' against the Italians last Saturday, I suggest the said correspondent be requested to eat her words, and be grateful they have an ice cream flavour to them. Leo J Martin, 70 St Lawrences Road, Clontarf, Dublin 3, Ireland</p>

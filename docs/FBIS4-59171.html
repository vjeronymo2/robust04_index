			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 9 May (INA)--The pro-government Kurdistan  Democratic Party has stressed that the Iraqi Kurds will not  abandon their loyalty to the leadership of President Saddam  Husayn regardless of all forms of imperialist, Zionist, and  reactionary plotting.    In a statement issued today in light of the bloody clashes  currently taking place in the Autonomous Region in northern Iraq  between the subversive, agent, and treasonous cliques, the party  said that the new crimes which are being perpetrated by these  cliques clearly reconfirm an established fact; namely, that the  Iraqi Kurds will not enjoy peace, security, and true prosperity  until the return of legitimacy and the central authority to the  all Iraqi Kurdistan.    The statement noted that the humiliated enemies,  conspirators, and traitors, who have imposed themselves as  trustees on the Iraqi Kurds by force, coercion, compulsion, and  terrorism, have spread destruction, sabotage, killing, and  terrorism all over Kurdistan, and perpetrated all forms of  crimes, including the plundering of the Kurdish people's food.  They have also spread chaos to the point where the citizens  have begun to feel insecure.    In its statement, the Kurdistan Democratic Party said that  the bloody confrontations taking place between the agent and  reactionary symbols and elements were the result of a conflict  between their selfish, parochial personal interests, which are  linked to the colonialist interests, without taking the Kurdish  people's aspirations and hopes into consideration.    The party called for solidarity between the Iraqi Kurds and  all the honest people in the world to expose these cliques and  their relations with the foreigners, to reject all their  actions, and to call for the return of legitimacy and the  constitutional authority to all Iraqi Kurdistan.</p>

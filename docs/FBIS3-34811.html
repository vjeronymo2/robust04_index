			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Robert Urbain, Belgium's foreign trade minister,  visited Damascus from 24 to 26 January. On the sidelines of the  visit, TISHRIN held a lengthy interview with Urbain in which he  responded to the editor's questions on Syrian-Belgian relations  and prospects for developing them. [passage omitted]    Urbain said: I would like to note that my visit to Syria  came a bit later than scheduled. The visit was supposed to take  place at the end of last year, but we had to postpone it until  the beginning of this year due to my heavy schedule.    The visit seeks to bolster bilateral relations and increase  cooperation to serve common interests. We will analyze and  evaluate the current status of bilateral relations and see how  they have been developing, especialzly now that there is peace  process in the region.    Urbain added: I believe that although the level of bilateral  relations is not great, it is constant. Our exports to Syria  totaled $100 million. Our exports included food products,  minerals, and chemical substances. Meanwhile, our imports from  Syria totaled $12 million. Foremost among these imports were  textiles and oil.    I would like to note that proceeding from this fact and in  light of the positive developments in the Syrian  economy--especially after the issuance of a law to promote  investment--and the growing role of the private sector, Belgian  businessmen and project owners are willing to establish  cooperation relations with Syria.    We, in the Belgian-Luxembourg union [as published], support  Belgian companies' participation in joint projects with Syria.    On the level of cooperation between the two governments,  Urbain said: We are highly concerned with the priorities of the  Syrian authorities in terms of what Belgium can offer as far as  implementing infrastructure projects, including electricity  projects.    We will soon sign an agreement for technical, economic, and  technological cooperation. I would like to note that the  signing of the agreement has been delayed for purely technical  reasons, especially on Luxembourg's part.    We seek to sign an agreement between Syria and the  Belgian-Luxembourg union to encourage and protect investments on  both sides. I believe there is a need to sign such an agreement.    Urbain continued: Belgium is a member of the European Union  [EU]. Cooperation between Syria and the EU is the framework  that defines Belgium's relations with Syria. Syria and the EU  have signed several agreements. In 1977, a third protocol for  technical and financial cooperation, amounting to 146 million  European Currency Units [ECU], was signed with the EC. In 1992,  a fourth protocol, amounting to 158 ECU's, was signed. The  protocol includes technical and financial aid to support the  Syrian Government's efforts in the energy and health sectors, as  well as other infrastructure projects. It also includes grants  to prepare and train cadres.    On prospects for promoting future relations between the two  countries, Urbain said: I believe that trade relations are a  question of needs and requirements. We are ready to help Syria  export more commodities to the EU states. The EU is a very  large market with a population of over 340 million. It is  important to promote relations between the two countries and to  provide an appropriate atmosphere for that purpose. The  nonexistence of Belgian investments in Syria is linked to this  issue. Therefore, I raised the need for signing a bilateral  agreement to protect and encourage investment.    He added: There are broad investment fields in Syria. The  Syrian Government's measures are useful. I hope that these  measures will be enforced. We hope the peace process will  reflect positively on the regional states. I would like to  point out that the EU called for the implementation of UN  Resolutions 242 and 338 on the Middle East. It also supported  the principle of land for peace.    Urbain continued: The international interest in peace in the  region and the international community's will to establish peace  in the Middle East have been greatly boosted by the outcome of  the very important meeting between Presidents al-Asad and  Clinton in Geneva. That meeting gave peace efforts a new  momentum.    Before moving to discuss the problems facing some Belgian  cabinet members, Urbain stressed that Belgium will present  specific proposals to bolster cooperation between the financial  and monetary institutions in both countries. He expressed the  Belgian Government's readiness to organize seminars in Belgium  in cooperation with Syria to explain many economic issues about  Syria and to increase the Syrian exports to the EU.

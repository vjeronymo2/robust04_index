			<p><P> November 30, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> FORMER POLICEMAN APPEALS DISMISSAL  </P> <P> A former Oxnard police officer convicted of assault with a deadly weapon is  appealing his subsequent dismissal from the department, contending that he was  fired because he is Latino, his attorney said.  </P> <P> Opening statements in Ray Centeno Jr.'s appeal to the Oxnard Board of Review  took place Thursday.  </P> <P> Centeno, an officer for 10 years, was fired by the Police Department  immediately after he was convicted of misdemeanor assault against his  brother-in-law, David Castanon, in 1989, said Centeno's attorney, James Farley.  </P> <P> Centeno hit Castanon after Castanon beat Centeno's sister, Farley said. Centeno  subsequently served 30 days in the Ventura County Jail and is still on  probation, Farley said.  </P> <P> However, Farley said Centeno's dismissal was harsher treatment than other  officers in the department, who were not Latino, have received for the same or  similar offenses.  </P> <P> In addition, Farley said, the punishment was too severe given Centeno's work  record.

			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Labour law must be simplified Sir, You were right to argue in your editorial, 'UK labour laws' (September 13), that employment law in the UK needs rationalisation, and that collective labour law is not the main problem. The most pressing need for reform is in relation to individual rights. Here the law is too difficult to understand and uneconomic to enforce. The law on everyday matters such as maternity leave is fully understood only by lawyers specialising in the field. Employees have to wait many months, sometimes years, for disputes to be resolved. Hearings last for days because industrial tribunals are bogged down in legalism and legal fees often far exceed the amount of compensation awarded. The problem stems from the policy of keeping statutory employment rights separate from contractual rights. The motive was to avoid legalism. It was hoped that by giving industrial tribunals jurisdiction over separate statutory rights covering matters such as unfair dismissal, redundancy pay, maternity and discrimination they would be able to dispense speedy, cheap and efficient justice. It hasn't worked. There is now a complex body of case law in each of these areas and delay and expense are accepted as a matter of course. The answer is not to complicate the law even further by adding quasi-constitutional rights or additional codes of practice to the present mix of European Community rights, statutory rights and contractual rights. The answer must be the opposite; to simplify and rationalise employment law by returning it to its roots in contract. If legislation simply required employers to provide minimal rights in the contract of employment, problems about overlap between contractual and statutory rights would disappear and whole areas of legalism - for instance much of the case law and unfair dismissal, redundancy and maternity - would fall away. Consider how this would work in relation to compensation for unfair dismissal. The contract would specify the circumstances in which an individual could be dismissed without compensation. This is, in effect, what happens at the moment in senior executive contracts. A contract would specify the amount of compensation to be paid in other cases, or a formula for calculating it, and, adopting one of your ideas, the employee would be protected against unreasonable dismissal by a code of practice agreed in the contract. In a dispute, the issue would simply be whether or not the employer had broken the contract of employment. If jurisdiction were given to industrial tribunals to determine such disputes they might be able to provide the cheap, speedy, effective justice originally intended.

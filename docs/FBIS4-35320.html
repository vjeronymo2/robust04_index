[passage omitted]    In an arrival statement to KUNA, the Yemeni envoy said he is  confident that his meetings with the amir of Kuwait and Kuwaiti  officials will be successful. He stated that they will discuss  the situation in Yemen "as a result of the war launched by the  military command in Sanaa in the same spirit and with the same  rationale as that with which the perfidious war was launched  against Kuwait."    Al-'Attas praised the efforts made by Arab states to halt  the  war and said that these efforts are appreciated by the Yemeni  people. [passage omitted]</p>

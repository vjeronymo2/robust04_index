			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Ecuador's centre-right ahead in poll EXIT polls published after the first round of presidential elections in Ecuador yesterday confirmed that two centre-right politicans will contest the presidency of Ecuador in July. The polls showed Mr Sixto Duran, 72, of the newly-formed Republican Unity party, obtaining 36 per cent of the votes, and Mr Jaime Nebot, of the Social Christian party, 26 per cent. Their nearest challenger, the populist Mr Abdala Bucaram - who nearly beat current President Rodrigo Borja in 1988 - polled 21 per cent. The polls confirmed the expected poor showing of the Democratic Left party of President Borja. His party's candidate, Mr Raul Baca, picked up only 8 per cent of the votes. Ecuadoreans also voted in congressional, provincial and local elections, with the exit polls confirming a stronger performance for the parties of the centre-right. The second round of presidential voting is scheduled for July 5, and the new president starts his four-year term on August 10. Both candidates have emphasised the need for a reduction in the role of the state, and support for policies such as privatisation. Ecuador is one of the few countries in South America not to have embraced market-oriented economic reforms. The behaviour in the second round of those who vote for Mr Bucaram in the first was said by political analysts in Quito to be critical to the final outcome of the presidential run-off. Voting is traditionally made along regional lines, with Mr Nebot's support concentrated in the coastal regions. Mr Duran, a steadier but less charismatic figure than Mr Nebot who has already run unsuccessfully twice for president, is from the highlands but claims links to the coast. Voting is compulsory except among the 7 per cent of the population deemed illiterate. The electorate is 5.7m, double that when Ecuador returned to democracy from military rule in 1978. The electoral process is regarded as relatively free of fraud, with ballots being counted under an Italian-financed computer system. The election campaign has also been relatively peaceful, aided by a law which bans the sale and consumption of alcohol for 72 hours around election day. Publication of opinion polls has been banned for 30 days ahead of the election.</p>

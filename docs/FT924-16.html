			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report COFFEE futures came under heavy pressure at the London Futures and Options Exchange yesterday in to continued speculative and investment fund liquidation in New York. The March delivery position ended Dollars 25 down at Dollars 1,010 a tonne and dealers said there might be scope for further losses in the short term. But they thought the market's constructive fundamentals would prompt a recovery in the new year. COCOA prices were also lower but the market remained near the upper end of its recent trading range. As the March futures price closed Pounds 5 lower at Pounds 693 a tonne dealers said that it continued to run into upside resistance in the Pounds 700 area, while key support remained at Pounds 657. Trading remained routine at the London Metal Exchange. NICKEL recovered Tuesday's slippage but was unable to erode resistance above Dollars 5,900 a tonne for three months metal. LEAD lacked follow through to Tuesday's advance and the three months price fell Pounds 5.25 to Pounds 300.75 a tonne. Compiled from Reuters</p>

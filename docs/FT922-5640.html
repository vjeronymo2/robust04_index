			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Money Markets: Pressure lifted AFTER several days of tight trading the pressure was finally taken off the UK money markets yesterday. Although the overnight rate climbed swiftly to well over 11 per cent in the early morning it plunged at midday once it became clear that the big liquidity shortage forecast by the Bank of England would be relieved easily, contrary to expectations. The Bank's initial forecast was less than the shortages forecast at the beginning of the week but still considerable at Pounds 1.3bn . In the early round of the Bank's operations traders held on to paper, keeping liquidity tight. As the cost of overnight money crept upwards the Bank acted to push overnight rates below 11 per cent. At midday it was successful. Overnight rates, which had started the day  3/8 of a point firmer at 11 3/8 per cent, fell to around 9 per cent after the Bank bought Pounds 1bn of bills across the bands and conducted its second repurchase agreement of the morning. After that, there was little life left in the market. Many operators had managed to square their books as the rate tumbled. Those who dithered found themselves paying up to 10 1/2 per cent later. In the afternoon the forecast was revised slightly to Pounds 1.35bn. The Bank operated again, purchasing a further Pounds 65m of band-1 bills at 9 7/8 per cent. Late assistance of Pounds 35m brought total interventions for the day to Pounds 1.3bn, all but taking out the shortage. The key three-month rate, which opened at 10 1/8 per cent eased to 10 1/16 per cent but moved back to close unchanged on the day. At the longer end, rates remained unchanged with six month money closing at 10 1/16 per cent, and one year money at 10 per cent. There was very little activity on the futures market which continued to indicate no early cut in base rates. The September sterling contract, now the most actively traded futures contract, edged up 6 basis points during the day from an open of 90.30. The June contract traded in a five tick range and closed at 90.02. The Federal Reserve added reserves to the banking system with four-day system repurchase agreements. Federal funds traded at 3 7/8 per cent.</p>

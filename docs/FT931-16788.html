			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Fujitsu expands plant with Pounds 35m investment FUJITSU, the Japanese electronics group, is gearing up for a big increase in production at its sole European microchip manufacturing plant at Newton Aycliffe, Co Durham. Process and test equipment worth Pounds 35m, which marks the only new investment worldwide this financial year by Fujitsu's electronic devices division, has been installed in the plant's 'clean room' production area with the objective of more than doubling its output by April. Throughout the Christmas and new year holiday shutdown, a team of 50 engineers and technicians commissioned the equipment ready for a swift increase in production of 4-megabit D-ram (dynamic random access memory) chips in time for all 450 employees who resumed work yesterday. Fujitsu, the world's second-biggest computer company and sixth-biggest semiconductor producer, cut its capital spending last year and reported a net after-tax loss of Y19.2bn (Pounds 102m) for the half year to September, its first net loss. In spite of a decline in the world computer and semiconductor markets, it is continuing investment in Newton Aycliffe. The site, where the company has spent Pounds 230m since the project was announced in 1989, has a strategic role for Fujitsu in penetrating the European market, since its output is not subject to import tariffs. It is also at the forefront of Fujitsu's technical advances. Investment in excess of this year's Pounds 35m has already been allocated for the plant for 1993-94 to allow it to start production of 16-megabit D-ram chips, the next generation of memory technology after 4-megabit chips. Fujitsu says it is the world's most advanced volume microchip plant. Mr Shiro Fujimoto, Newton Aycliffe-based managing director of Fujitsu Microelectronics, said: 'Investment here is going faster than in Japan. In Europe many customers require our products. It is a very important factory with the newest technology.' Fujitsu expects to raise production at Newton Aycliffe from the current 500,000 chips a month to 1.2m by April. Mr Llew Aviss, personnel director, said: 'They're anxious to see we meet our production goals but very supportive. We're quite bullish about it.' The project was expected to cost Pounds 400m and employ 1,500 people by the end of 1994. The payroll, 36 of them Japanese, includes 150 technicians and engineers and is expected to reach 500 by the end of this year. The company says the pace of technological change means it is unlikely to employ 1,500 for another 10 years, but investment may be greater. 'The number was Pounds 400m plus,' says Mr Aviss. 'It's going to be a hell of a plus.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Sergey Chugayev report: "Having Declared Amnesty, Duma </F> Leaders Have Begun Presidential Campaign"]    [Text] V. Zhirinovskiy, leader of the LDPR [Liberal  Democratic Party of Russia] faction in the State Duma, announced  after the close of the 23 February session of the lower chamber  of parliament that this day could be regarded as a new Russian  national holiday -- a sort of Day of General Reconciliation.  For his part, S. Yushenkov, one of the leaders of the "Russia's  Choice" faction, expressed the belief that this day could signal  the start of civil war.    Such polarized opinions regarding the decree adopted by the  Duma on an amnesty for those who took part in the August [1991]  and October [1993] events in Moscow must, obviously, be put down  to understandable emotions. The assessment given in the Duma  lobbies by one of the leaders of the "intransigents" seems more  accurate: The amnesty act was adopted in order to give a fillip  to the country's domestic political situation which has become  somewhat static since last October.    It must be admitted that the attempt was entirely  successful.  The domestic political situation in the country has livened up  noticeably. But this fact yet again demonstrates quite  graphically that the State Duma has focused exclusively on  politics, and there are currently no grounds for hoping that it  will get down to lawmaking.    To confirm this conclusion, it suffices to analyze the  progress of the Duma debates 23 February. Virtually all those  present, that is to say the leaders of the factions and  deputies' groups, paid little heed to the topic of the day --  the amnesty itself -- mainly devoting their speeches to  expounding political programs. It was therefore hard to shake  off the impression that you were attending the launch of a  presidential election campaign. Indeed, the time is already  ripe for this campaign to begin, and it can be assumed that it  was this fact which impelled a number of Duma factions to be so  persistent in bringing to a successful conclusion the solution  to the problem of an amnesty for people who hold the same views  as they do.    The organizers' main target, judging by information provided  by factions on the left, is not the president and the  government, although, needless to say, they will not be left in  peace. The same G. Zyuganov who called for civil peace demanded  a change of government. The main objective, however odd it may  seem if we bear in mind the LDPR faction's initiative proposing  the combination of a political and economic amnesty in a single  decree (this formula consequently became one of the main reasons  for the triumph of the amnesty's supporters), was to knock one  of the favorites -- V. Zhirinovskiy -- out of the presidential  elections, which are just beginning. The united opposition has  acquired the chance to have a popular leader and can  correspondingly count on the support of a significant proportion  of LDPR supporters. It seems that V. Zhirinovskiy himself is  perfectly well aware of this fact, but he is obliged to go for  broke, so to speak.    Thus, in the opinion of most observers, if the leaders of  the  defenders of the White House were to be released, a desperate  leadership struggle would unfold on the political left wing.  And this could not fail to have an impact on the unity and  strength of the ranks of Communists and patriots.    Consequently there is every reason to think that the same  factors will encourage concentration on the right wing of the  political spectrum. And Gaydar's embryonic party has the  opportunity to become much more than an ephemeral political  structure.    At the same time, as the course of the 23 February Duma  session showed, the niche in the center between the two wings  which has remained vacant for some time has apparently already  been filled.    There is every reason for thinking that the package of  documents adopted by the Duma, which includes the decree on the  political amnesty, was passed mainly with the assistance of the  PRUA [Party of Russian Unity and Accord] faction. It was the  rapid departure of this faction from the right wing which  guaranteed the supporters of the amnesty the necessary advantage  of just over 33 votes. Moreover, the obvious harmony between the  Memorandum on Accord adopted by the Duma, which acted as pretty  packaging for the decree on the political amnesty, and the PRUA  faction's announcement published a few days previously on its  civil reconciliation initiative, gives cause to suggest that S.  Shakhray actively participated in the preparation of that very  package of documents which included the decree on the political  amnesty.    In the opinion of a number of observers, this proves that S.  Shakhray has finally broken away from the presidential team and  that he was unsuited for the prime minister's political team,  which he has been ardently seeking to join of late. Obviously,  the quest for new political allies led S. Shakhray to the Duma,  where his rapid rapprochement with Speaker of the House I.  Rybkin, who has switched to centrist stances, is not going  unnoticed. It is sufficient to cite the example of the  appointment of Shakray's close friend A. Boykov as leader of the  Duma apparatus despite severe resistance from the Communists,  the agrarians, and Zhirinovskiy's supporters. Thus it is  difficult to shake off the impression that the leader of the  PRUA faction intends to embark on the path taken by R.  Khasbulatov in order to implement his political aims: Namely,  with the speaker's help, to seize control of the Duma apparatus  and, using it, to form on the basis of factions gravitating  toward the center if not a majority, then a strong and, most  importantly, manageable group of deputies.    All of this ultimately leads to the conclusion that the  majority of Duma politicians will continue exclusively to  resolve their own political issues, to fight for victory in the  presidential races, for instance. Work on laws in this  situation has every chance of being consigned to oblivion.    And this, in turn, means that the Memorandum on Accord, the  need for whose adoption was accepted by the Duma majority by  dint of its support for the political amnesty, is unlikely to  function. At any rate, the speeches by a number of faction  leaders gave no cause to conclude that they intend to implement  the ideas expounded in the memorandum.</p>

			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Pendragon Pounds 11m rights issue funds purchase PENDRAGON, the motor distributor demerged from Williams Holdings, has launched an Pounds 11m rights issue to fund the acquisition of Portmann, the Manchester-based Mercedes-Benz car dealership. The offer, of one share at 115p for every two held, has been underwritten by Schroders. The shares rose 7p to close at 155p yesterday. Proceeds will be used to buy Portmann for about Pounds 4.75m and to fund a 'war chest' for future acquisitions. Since its demerger from Williams in 1989 Pendragon has expanded its franchises through a programme of acquisitions. Mr Trevor Finn, chief executive, said the group was hopeful of taking advantage of Nissan's decision to terminate its franchise with Nissan UK. 'We believe there will be a number of opportunities to buy franchises if Nissan goes ahead with its decision to end its agreement with Nissan UK. There are also a number of small franchisers who are in real difficulty.' The group is looking at Europe and plans to add Japanese franchises to its portfolio. Since the beginning of the year it has bought a Saab dealership in Birmingham, the Porsche dealership for Manchester and now the Portmann Mercedes-Benz dealership. It has 27 franchises in 22 locations. Year-end borrowings of Pounds 4.29m (Pounds 9.9m) have been reduced further to Pounds 1.5m, with gearing just under 10 per cent. After the rights issue and acquisition Pendragon will have Pounds 3m cash and net assets of Pounds 32.4m, on a pro forma basis. Portmann has been sold by a subsidiary of Hartwell, the Oxford-based motor distributor which last year was taken over by the Saudi Arabian Jameel organisation. In the nine months to November 30 Portmann made pre-tax profits of Pounds 900,000 on turnover of Pounds 13m, with no borrowings. In 1990 Pendragon made Pounds 5.1m on turnover of Pounds 174.4m.</p>

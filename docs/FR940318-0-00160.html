			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The majority of public comments received on the foams sector in the proposed rule focused on three issues: The viability or availability of substitutes; the need for listing of alternative technologies or manufacturing processes, and the need for notification under SNAP for use of blends or mixture of blowing agents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Viability or availability of listed substitutes. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters suggested that the NPRM did not sufficiently address the performance and practicality of use of acceptable substitutes. Commenters were especially concerned about alternative blowing agents used in thermal insulation applications, and whether acceptable substitutes represented existing or experimental use. For example, several commenters stated that if the alternative blowing agent will affect the insulating capacity of a foam it should be part of the SNAP analysis, and the outcome should be discussed as part of the listing decision. Another commenter contended that for many of the end-uses, not all of the listed HCFC substitutes are technically viable, but each should be listed anyway to maximize the breadth of options. This commenter also reported that uses of some of the HFCs and hydrocarbons are still in development and, therefore do not represent actual alternatives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA recognizes that the use of alternative blowing agents in insulation products can affect the energy efficiency of the final product. In this final rule, the overall risk characterization for substitutes under SNAP specifically takes into account indirect contributions to global warming. However, EPA also recognizes that the changes in foam formulation or product thickness can result in products with insulation efficiency equivalent to CFC-blown foam. Therefore, EPA believes it is appropriate to consider and comment on the difference in thermal conductivity of alternative blowing agents as compared to the CFC being replaced, and compared to other acceptable substitutes. However, it would be inappropriate to comment on the expected performance of a foam product using one blowing agent versus another, given that formulations are highly proprietary and can vary significantly from manufacturer-to-manufacturer. Further, EPA believes it is preferable to identify a broad range of alternatives, and let the market determine which alternative produce the best performing insulation products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters requested clarification on the definition of hydrocarbons. One commenter suggested a more specific definition for hydrocarbons of ``saturated light hydrocarbons, C3&hyph;C6.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency agrees with these commenters. Since the broad use of hydrocarbon in the NPRM may be viewed as potentially precluding other viable substitutes, and because the alternate definition suggested by the commenter encompasses those specifically listed hydrocarbons as well as more recently identified materials being tested in foams such as cyclopentane, this definition has been adopted by EPA in the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Alternative technologies or manufacturing processes. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters argued that EPA should not issue its seal of approval for substitutes that are alternative products, unless and until the Agency evaluates them with the same degree of detail that HCFCs were evaluated, particularly with regard to toxicity, technical feasibility, flammability, and energy impacts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency believes that alternative products and alternative manufacturing processes will play an important role in the transition from ODSs in many sectors. In light of public comment, the Agency recognized that the SNAP data requirements and the SNAP evaluation process proposed in the NPRM were biased toward chemical substitutes. The Agency also agrees with public comment that review of non-chemical alternatives must be supported by appropriate analysis. In this final rule, the Agency has made revisions to the SNAP Information Notice to better account for the different information requirements associated with non-chemical alternatives and increased the discussion of the Agency's analysis of non-chemical alternatives in the background documents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Use of blends. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters argued that EPA's proposed requirement for notification and review of chemical alternative blends was unnecessary and burdensome for the foams sector. The comments proposed that any combination or blend of individually acceptable blowing agents should be permitted without additional notification to SNAP. One commenter suggested EPA clarify that the term ``blend'' when used in the SNAP rule does not refer to individual, separately-``acceptable'' substitutes, two or more of which may be used in the same manufacturing process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In light of these public comments, the Agency re-examined the analytical basis for reviewing blends, to determine whether the potential human health and environmental risks would be different for blends or mixtures of chemicals than those of individual chemicals that were determined to be acceptable for use in the foams manufacturing process under SNAP. In particular, the Agency was concerned with potential synergistic effects of the chemical blends, and that the decomposition product profile would differ from that of a single chemical.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

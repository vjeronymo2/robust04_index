			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Scotland speeds up commerce cases The Court of Session, Scotland's supreme civil court, is to try to speed up its handling of commercial cases, which has been heavily criticised by companies for its slowness. Lord Hope, the Lord President, who is the senior judge in Scotland's legal system, yesterday nominated Lord Penrose, one of the 27 judges of the Court of Session, to concentrate purely on commercial cases. Lord Hope said there was great reluctance among Scottish companies to bring commercial litigation in the Court of Session. They considered it time-consuming and found the court lacking in expertise. He wanted them to stop feeling that they had to take their civil actions to England. Although much Scottish law differs from English law, most of the law governing commercial matters applies to the whole of the UK.</p>

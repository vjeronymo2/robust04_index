This  project, which uses new-generation domestically made digital  fiber optic communications equipment developed by MPT's Wuhan  Institute of P&amp;T Science, will employ the 1B1H encoding  format  suited to China's needs. The project employs a number of  advanced technologies, including VLSI circuits and thick-film  circuits, integrated digital signal processing/computer  techniques, and miniaturized, low-loss, high-reliability  equipment. Each system, in addition to the 1920 circuits  provided in the main channel, can furnish an additional 1200  circuits (an increase of 62.5 percent capacity) via application  of the ``H'' code. The Beijing-Wuhan-Guangzhou buried optical  cable project, funded by a loan from the Asian Development Bank,  employed international tenders. After sharp competition, the  contract was awarded to MPT's Meishan Communications Equipment  Plant.</p>

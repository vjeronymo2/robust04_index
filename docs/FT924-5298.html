			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Queen taxed THE BRITISH monarchy has been a remarkably successful institution. It has also been a highly adaptable one. The adaptability of the monarchy largely explains the success. The Queen's offer to pay taxes on her private income and, as importantly, trim the civil list represents an excellent example of the monarchy's flexibility. These changes, sensible in themselves, are also more likely to strengthen the monarchy than weaken it. Rationalists dislike monarchies. But constitutional monarchy has proved to be an obstacle neither to economic progress nor to democratic stability. On the contrary, their shrunken numbers include many of the world's richest democracies: in Europe there are Sweden, Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium and more recently Spain; in Asia, there is Japan. In these societies the monarch's role as a living symbol of the state has proved consistent with political stability and indeed one of its sources. These monarchies have all changed markedly over time, as has the British. It has survived a civil war and the decapitation of Charles I. It has outlived the acquisition and collapse of the British empire. Above all, it has coped with the transition from aristocracy to democracy. Now it has to adapt to an age of populist suspicion and popular curiosity. It has to tackle two specific problems: the all too visible foibles of minor members of the royal family and the untaxed wealth of the Queen herself. By yesterday's announcement the monarchy has done what it can, short of a credible vow of poverty and personal perfection. Nothing will stop the popular press from probing the private lives of members of the royal family. But with the compensation for their public services being reimbursed from the Queen's privy purse they may be criticised less easily. Similarly, nothing will stop left-wing politicians from complaining about the Queen's wealth. But properly taxed it becomes just another inherited private fortune. The monarch's role is fundamentally symbolic, but scandal and untaxed wealth are unsatisfactory symbols. There had to be changes. Whether these go far enough is another matter. A clearer definition of the monarch's role in the state may be required, particularly if there are wider constitutional changes. The future of the monarchy depends partly on the royal family itself, but still more on the changing temper of the British people.</p>

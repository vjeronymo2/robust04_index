These sequences were compared with other  published dengue-2 envelope sequences.    The result showed that the homology of nucleotide sequences  between D2-04, D2-05, and D2-43 were 95.76-95.96 percent. The  similarities of amino acid sequences were 92.12-94.3 percent.  The nucleotide changes between each other of those strains were  not obvious. However, when D2-04, D2-05, D2-43 were compared  with NGC in transition and transversion respectively, the  transitions were more than the transversions. The transversion  of D2-05 was more than D2-04 and D2-43.    The changes of codons in the third position were mostly  observed in D2-04, D2-05, and D2-43, but we found that the  changes in the first and second position of D2-05 were more than  D2-04 and D2-43. It may be a factor affecting the changes of  biological properties.    When D2-04, D2-05, and D2-43 strains were compared with JAM,  NGC, M3 and PR159(S1) strains, it showed that these three  strains were most similar with JAM strain, most dissimilar with  PR159(S1) strain at nucleotide level. The similarities of amino  acid sequences corresponded to homology of nucleotide sequences  between each other of D2-04, D2-05, and D2-43 strains. The  results indicated that D2-04, D2-05, and D2-43 were more closely  related to JAM strain than NGC and M3 strain and less related to  PR159(S1) from Puerto Rico.</p>

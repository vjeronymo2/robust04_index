			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, April 6 -- President Lech Walesa received  Finnish Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto on Wednesday afternoon,  according to the presidential press office.    "As countries of medium size we should play a bigger role in  Europe. Poland and Finland want to find themselves in European  organisations which have shown themselves to be effective.  Finland has already succeeded, Poland still faces a long road,"  Walesa said.    The talks also covered security. "The stationing of such a  numerous (Russian) army in the Kaliningrad region is a worrying  phenomenon. It is difficult to explain this phenomenon in  peacetime. After speaking to many international politicians I  have found that this problem is not enough known to world  opinion," Walesa added.    He also drew attention to the insufficient aid given by the  West to facilitate the changes taking place in east and central  Europe.    Walesa stressed that these countries needed to be included  in  the world market economy, something which could not be done  while thinking in old categories. Europe needed a new vision.  If this did not take place then the lack of political and  economic security in the region would adversely affect the rest  of Europe.    Haavisto gave assurances that Finland would support Poland's  efforts to join the European Union.</p>

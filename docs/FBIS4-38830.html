			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First  Channel Network in Russian at 1745 GMT on 2 June carries a  14-minute report by an unidentified announcer on a news  conference given by Russian President Boris Yeltsin and South  Korean President Kim Yong-sam. The report begins with historic  background information on Russia's diplomatic and trade links  with South Korea. Russia's and South Korea's views on the  partnership between the two countries are outlined and a video  showing the two presidents signing documents is shown.    Yeltsin is then shown speaking at the news conference: "We  saw our task not so much in summing up what has already been  done, but in establishing firm prospects for further  cooperation. We wanted to make sure that the breakthrough we  made in 1992 will not lose its momentum, that our ties will  continue to strengthen, and agreements reached in principle will  each day be filled with new concrete actions. President Kim  Yong-sam and I have signed the new Moscow Declaration. In our  opinion, this is a major political document aimed at the future.    "After the treaty on the principles of bilateral relations  signed in Seoul in November 1992 this declaration represents a  new step forward in the course of our mutually beneficial  cooperation. The agreement to introduce regular exchange visits  of young people as from next year is also aimed at the future.  This will enable our peoples to know each other better.    "We have repeatedly stated that we are interested in full-  blooded economic ties and would like to see investments by South  Korean firms into our economy increasing, especially in the Far  East. The active participation of companies from the Republic  of Korea in conversion of our defense industry could also be of  mutual benefit. We have arrived at a good level of  understanding in regard to these issues."    Having spoken on economic relations between Russia and South  Korea, Yeltsin then moves on to the issue of North Korea:    "We paid considerable attention to examining the situation  on  the Korean Peninsula in the context of nuclear nonproliferation.  Russia is greatly concerned by the uncontrollability of the  nuclear issue in that region and fundamentally believes that the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea should remain a full  participant in the Treaty on Nuclear Nonproliferation and carry  out in full its obligations under the monitoring agreement of  the IAEA. That is our main policy.    "At the same time, we believe that political methods should  be used to solve the North Korean nuclear problem and the laws  and interests of all interested parties should not be infringed.  One of the ways to implement this is the Russian proposal for  an international conference on security and the nonnuclear  status of the Korean Peninsula to be attended by Russia, both  the Korean states, the United States, China, and Japan, as well  UN and IAEA representatives.    "During the talks we also touched on the issue of the  100,000  ethnic Korean Russian citizens living in Russia. Our party  stressed that Russia's Koreans, like all other Russians in our  multi-ethnic country, have the right to state support in  preserving their culture, language, and customs and in the  development of links with their historical homeland. We have  every reason for optimism in assessing the prospects of our  relations with the Republic of Korea. We see them as a  relationship of constructive good-neighborliness."    The announcer then says that questions connected with the  possible nonnuclear status of the Korean Peninsula were at the  center of attention during the news conference.    Yeltsin says: "We, the two presidents, are very concerned  about what is happening in the People's Democratic Republic of  Korea because it directly borders with Russia. Therefore, we  cannot be indifferent to the way the DPRK regards the treaties  on nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, and are prepared to act  accordingly. At first, the United States was dealing with this  matter, but the question dragged on, and so far no positive  solution has been found. We will try to talk to U.S. President  Clinton today, if we can reach him--he is on official visit at  the moment. After all, we propose that the international  community should use its influence in solving this question. In  other words, it should be discussed between Russia, the two  Koreas, the United States, Japan, China, the United Nations, and  the IAEA. We should all meet at a summit and solve this problem  accordingly. I think this is the only way to solve this  problem. I should say that Mr. Kim Yong-sam has agreed in  principle with this proposal."    The announcer goes on to say that, at one point, Yeltsin  answered a question from a South Korean journalist about whether  Russia might impose sanctions against North Korea and, in  general, what Russia's position was, given that the treaty of  mutual assistance between Russia and North Korea was still in  force.    Yeltsin says: "Today, when the decision has not yet been  made to convene an international conference on the problem, as  it were, the nuclear problem of the DPRK, it is just a bit too  early to speak straight away about sanctions. But, in  principle, if matters reach a point where the DPRK digs in its  heels and refuses to sign, as it were, or rather to annul the  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, bearing in mind the nearness of  our shores, which constitutes a danger to Russia and to our  population, we will be obliged, gradually, of course, firstly to  warn, and later, probably, the world community will have to  adopt, may also adopt some kind of sanctions.    "As for war and the 1961 Treaty, an amendment to Article One  was made in 1990 whereby there is no longer any rigid  stipulation about our helping or siding with the DPRK."    Yeltsin is then asked by a Mayak Radio correspondent if he  discussed Russia's debt to South Korea during his talks with  Kim. Yeltsin replies: "Yes, of course we discussed the issue.  The debt is equal to almost 1.4 billion dollars, 400 million of  that sum is outstanding debt. This is a serious problem that is  hampering the development and implementation of the major  projects that already exist between us, and a special consortium  has been set up to advance these projects, such as a  Yakutiya-Korea gas pipe or the development of the port of  Nakhodka, or the construction of a trade center in Moscow and,  well, a lot of other projects and objectives of this kind.    "During the discussions, I for one was given to understand  that the president of Korea was sympathetic toward the issue of  postponing the debt, the start of the cancellation of the debt.  That is important for us."    To the question of whether Russia is considering paying a  compensation for the victims of the Korean Airlines airliner  shot down in 1983, Yeltsin says: "This tragedy occurred during  the Cold War period and was caused by a combination of a number  of circumstances. We handed over all the relevant documents and  the international commission that was set up to study all the  aspects of this tragedy found that, after all, the crew of the  KAL company was at fault. They should bear the responsibility."    The announcer then says that Kim Yong-sam spoke about the  results of his visit to Moscow, and said that this was very  useful. Kim Yong-sam is quoted as saying: I believe that in the  course of my visit and my talks with Mr. Yeltsin we discovered  new approaches toward the positive and substantial development  of our relations. The further development of our relations will  undoubtedly help the peace process in Asia and in the rest of  the world.    Yeltsin is then shown summing up the news conference and  says: "I believe the most important thing is the spirit in which  our discussions were held. They were held on the basis and in  the spirit of friendship, mutual understanding, cooperation,  partnership, and personal liking for each other--which is very  important. The fact that just in one year our trade turnover  with South Korea has doubled means that our peoples and our  leaders have enormous reserves for developing cooperation  exactly on this basis. Thank you."</p>

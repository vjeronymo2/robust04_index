This edict enters into force from the moment of signing.    [Signed] B.N. Yeltsin, president of the Russian Federation    Moscow, the Kremlin    Draft presented by I. Kivelidi  <H5>  Opinion </H5>   Since this draft was sent out by Oleg Soskovets, first  vice-premier of the government, for an evaluation by various  authoritative specialists in this field, we are able to publish  one of the comments.    To O.N. Soskovets, first deputy chairman of the Government  of  the Russian Federation    The country is choking in bureaucratic licentiousness. The  attempt at a transition from the totalitarian economic system to  the market system by means of the administration and command  system embellished by democratic slogans has collapsed.    Millions of producers, as before, are not owners of their  labor and its results. This labor and its results are  appropriated by the bureaucratic system. The preservation of  hired labor with the removal of surplus value makes any  administrative foci of the type of organization of new federal  state systems for the development of entrepreneurship senseless.  This is an attempt to maintain, at the expense of the poor  taxpayer, a huge army of idlers, who will definitively regulate  the pitiful and ugly development of the free market.    The introduction of the capitalist system from above on the  basis of the collectivization and industrialization model is  doomed to failure.    The fact that, allegedly, Russia's businessmen are  interested  in the creation of another bureaucratic monster evokes surprise.  As an entrepreneur, who over a period of 8 years has engaged in  free economy, I can say one thing: I do not need a state body,  which will drive me to capitalism. I think that all  entrepreneurs need normal economic laws and taxes and not new  bureaucratic administrators.    I consider the draft documents on the organization of the  "Ministry of Capitalism" a mistake.    Such a body under the Government of the Russian Federation  can be useful only as a public body not forming part of the  authorized staff of the Government of the Russian Federation.    Respectfully,    [Signed] Prof. S.N. Fedorov, general director of the Moscow  "Mikrokhirurgiya glaza" Scientific and Technical Complex</p>

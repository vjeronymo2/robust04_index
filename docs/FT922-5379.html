			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar faces difficult session AFTER A catastrophic overnight session, the dollar began to pick up in early European trading. Traders said the dollar's collapse in Asian operations had been sparked by a combination of weak money supply data, heavy selling by a big US trader, intervention by the Bank of Japan and a host of stop-loss sales. The slide in the M2 measure of the money supply disappointed expectations of a Dollars 3.7bn drop. Instead M2 fell Dollars 7.4bn to put annual growth at 2.3 per cent, below the Federal Reserve's target range of 2.5 to 6.5 per cent. There was slightly better news for the dollar around mid-day when revised GDP data were released, showing that GDP growth in the first quarter was 2.4 per cent rather than 2 per cent. That marks the best quarterly growth in three years and contrasts sharply with 0.4 per cent growth in the fourth quarter of 1991. However, the revision was not as good as some had hoped and failed to persuade dollar-bulls to hang on to the US currency. In late trading, as more decided to cut their losses and sell, the dollar tested support below DM1.6050. By the close it had sunk to DM1.6070 after a DM1.6265 London close on Thursday and to Y127.70 from Y128.33. In early US operations the dollar bounced off its lows, but was still down half a pfennig on the D-mark and down half a yen on the Japanese currency. Trading of European currencies was fairly quiet as many dealers extended Thursday's Ascension day holiday into the weekend. Often a beneficiary of dollar weakness, the D-mark was inert yesterday, ending steady in the EMS grid. The escudo stayed firmly at the top of the grid at 5.9 per cent above the weakest currency, still the Danish crown. The Swiss franc lost a little ground after its spectacular recovery during the week, but still closed firmer than on Wednesday. Traders reported solid, broad-based buying. This partly reflected recent rises in Swiss market interest rates and partly the unwinding of a big dollar/Swiss position by a big US operator. The Swiss currency continued to benefit from comments made on Wednesday by Mr Markus Lusser, the Swiss national bank president. He said he would like to see the currency strengthen. The D-mark was quoted at 90.78 centimes, up from 90.54 at the opening but below Wednesday's final 91.15 centimes. Sterling was side lined in the three-way battle between the dollar, D-mark and yen but remained static on the D-mark and firm on the dollar.</p>

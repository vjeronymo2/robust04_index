			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "China Upholds Sovereignty, United States </F> Hesitates About What Move To Make"]    [Text] U.S. Secretary of State Christopher gave prominence  to the human rights issue before and during his current visit to  China, and announced that he had the support of more than 200  U.S. senators and congressmen. He stressed that the human  rights issue would be linked with the issue of China's  most-favored-nation [MFN] status. Before his visit, he sent  Assistant Secretary of State Shattuck ahead of him to make  arrangements and to contact a very small number of people who  have attempted to undermine China's stability and to collect  pretexts for not extending MFN. Christopher thought that as  long as he wielded the human rights club, he would certainly be  able to gain something from his visit to China, not only  interfering in China's internal affairs but also opening up the  Chinese market and creating a new model of diplomacy between the  two countries by forcing China to swallow his bitter medicine.    However, China firmly adhered to its position and firmly  rejected the U.S. concept of human rights. It reiterated that  no one could interfere in China's internal affairs.    Qian Qichen, Li Peng, and Jiang Zemin successively met with  Christopher. They mentioned that China and the United States  face a historical opportunity for economic and trade  cooperation, and also talked about China's own concept of human  rights. On the issue of human rights, the two sides frankly  expressed their own opinions and arguments. The three Chinese  leaders expressed the same point of view, and firmly safeguarded  China's sovereignty. Premier Li Peng pointed out: "China and  the United States hold different concepts of human rights. It  is unfair to impose the human rights concept of the developed  countries on developing countries. China and the United States  can discuss their differences on the issue of human rights on an  equal footing, and no pressure should be exerted by one side on  the other. If MFN is rescinded, China will not be the only one  to suffer losses, and losses suffered by the United States will  not be smaller than those of China. China mainly relies on its  domestic market and has a strong self-sufficient ability. If  Sino-U.S. relations are good, economic and trade cooperation  between the two counties will be free from artificial  hindrances, and U.S. business circles will have a historical  opportunity for development."    Li Peng said China's imports would increase to $1,000  billion  over the next seven years, and many imported items will be in  areas which are strong points of the United States. On the  other hand, Christopher conceded that his visit to China was  aimed at seeking a long-term and stable cooperative relationship  with China.    Li Peng's arguments were mainly focused on the practical  advantages of Sino-U.S. cooperation, and were quite convincing  for the U.S. side.    President Jiang Zemin responded to Christopher's viewpoint  about linking the human rights issue with trade from an overall,  long-term, and strategic point of view. Christopher's current  visit to the East is aimed at implementing President Clinton's  diplomatic policy toward the East. The United States is trying  to make use of the opportunity of Asia's vigorous economic  development to build closer relations with various Asian  countries. If Christopher forgot this strategic task, he would  just have returned home with both hands empty. Therefore,  President Jiang Zemin proceeded from a strategically  advantageous position in his talks with Christopher by reviewing  his meeting with President Clinton. He said: "Sino-U.S.  relations are more than bilateral relations. We should approach  our bilateral relations from a worldwide view and give  consideration to future development, especially in the 21st  century. China and the United States share common interests on  many major issues. So both sides should increase mutual trust,  reduce trouble, develop cooperation, and prevent confrontation.  President Clinton expressed agreement with my opinion." How  come the U.S. position endorsed by Clinton changed when  Christopher came to China? Christopher did not respond to this  point.    Jiang Zemin mentioned Christopher's personal experience of  the process of normalizing Sino-U.S. relations during the Carter  administration, and affirmed that he had good knowledge of the  history of Sino-U.S. relations. In the past 45 years, Sino-U.S.  relations have undergone innumerous twists and turns, and there  have been both positive and negative experiences. "If both  sides transcend ideology to develop cooperation, Sino-U.S.  relations will advance. This is not only beneficial to both  peoples but is also conducive to world peace and stability. If  things go in the opposite direction, Sino-U.S. relations will  encounter difficulties and setbacks." As far as human rights is  concerned, Jiang Zemin pointed out sharply: Some people in the  West are not really concerned about the rights, interests, and  prosperity of the vast number of Chinese people; instead, they  are only concerned about a small number of people who try to  subvert the Chinese Government and undermine China's stability.  "This is in essence a political issue and a legal issue rather  than a human rights issue." China's viewpoint is identical with  that held by other Asian countries. Even Lee Kuan Yew agrees  with this. If these trouble-makers take power, China will be  thrown into major chaos, and this would be unfavorable to the  Chinese people.    On completing his visit to Beijing, Christopher did not  smile, because even the American Chamber of Commerce was opposed  to his diplomatic approach. He had thrown away a golden  opportunity to promote Sino-U.S. economic and trade relations  and had returned with both hands empty. An American businessman  pointed out: Human rights should not be linked with MFN, which  should be given to China unconditionally. If favorable tariff  arrangements between the two countries are removed, U.S.-Chinese  relations will regress. In that case, China's losses would just  be temporary, but losses suffered by the United States would be  long-term losses.    If the United States really wants to share in Asia's  economic  prosperity, President Clinton should actually honor his policy  of supporting "a strong, stable, and prosperous China, which is  in the national interests of the United States." If their deeds  do not match their words and they still attempt to create  trouble in China's political situation, then what they do will  not be in the long-term interests of the United States; neither  will this be favorable to peace, stability, and prosperity in  Asia. After his debates with Chinese leaders, Christopher  hesitated about what move to make. He did not express a clear  position on MFN and behaved rather prudently. He needs to  discuss with President Clinton to see whether the United States  can actually use this card. It is certain that U.S. business  circles will not support a diplomatic policy that will just harm  the U.S. economy, because imposing sanctions against China is in  fact an act of imposing sanctions against the United States  itself.</p>

			<p><P> May 8, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS SAN DIEGO COUNTY;  </P> <P> VOTER DISCONTENT HAS INCUMBENTS SQUIRMING  </P> <P> Little more than a year ago, political consultant Nick Johnson half-jokingly  described San Diego elections as being "usually about as unpredictable as  elections in Russia."  </P> <P> "If you're an incumbent here, it's like being on the Communist Party ticket in  Russia or East Germany," the Democratic consultant said. "You're that safe."  </P> <P> Today, Johnson's comparison is perhaps even more apt than when he made it,  though for reasons he scarcely could have imagined. For just as wildly  unpredictable democratic reforms have swept Eastern Bloc nations, so too has  1990 become a season of dramatic transformation in San Diego politics.  </P> <P> Five San Diego-area legislators -- four state Assembly members and one  congressman -- face serious opposition in the June 5 primary. These races have  created the most competitive primary here in recent political history.  </P> <P> And collectively, the contests have made San Diego County a compelling  departure from the norm across the state, where primary challenges against  incumbents typically are races more in name than in fact.  </P> <P> "There's never been anything like this in San Diego -- it's totally  unprecedented," said former Democratic Rep. Lionel Van Deerlin.  </P> <P> Those facing tough contests are U.S. Rep. Jim Bates and Assemblymen Pete Chacon  and Steve Peace -- all Democrats -- and Republican Assemblywomen Sunny  Mojonnier and Tricia Hunter.  </P> <P> With the exception of Hunter, who is running in her first reelection campaign  after winning a special election last October, the challenges to the incumbents  represent the first serious primary opposition they have faced during terms in  office stretching from seven to 20 years.  </P> <P> Theories abound as to why primary contests that previously were little more  than electoral formalities have suddenly become competitive.  </P> <P> Incumbents' alleged ethical transgressions -- Mojonnier, Chacon and Bates were  the subjects of official investigations recently -- galvanized several of the  challengers.  </P> <P> And Hunter's advocacy of abortion rights in her conservative, heavily  Republican district all but guaranteed that she would draw opposition, as she  has, from an anti-abortion foe.  </P> <P> Most challengers also hope to capitalize on what they perceive as growing  public dissatisfaction with incumbents in general, a disdain they attribute to  recent scandals in Sacramento and Washington.  </P> <P> Among the threatened incumbents, Mojonnier, Chacon and Bates -- in that order  -- are viewed by political observers as the most vulnerable, largely because  each has been buffeted by serious ethical charges that compounded existing  questions about their effectiveness.  </P> <P> Hunter and Peace, while both facing credible challengers, are expected to  survive, barring disastrous last-minute blunders on their part. But even in  these two races, it is a measure of the changed realities of San Diego politics  that any uncertainty surrounds the outcome.  </P> <P> Hunter's opponent is Connie Youngkin, a leader of Operation Rescue, the  anti-abortion group that stages regular protests in front of abortion clinics.  For her part in one demonstration, Youngkin was convicted of trespassing and  faces a six-month sentence -- creating the prospect that she could be in jail  at some point this year. Undaunted, Youngkin has said: "First I go to jail,  then I go to Sacramento. . . . Some of them go to Sacramento and then go to  jail."  </P> <P> Peace, meanwhile, has drawn two primary opponents -- lawyers Darrel Vandeveld  and Robert Garcia. The incumbent's abrasive style was cited by both as a factor  in their decision to run against him. But Peace's fund raising has outpaced his  two foes' by a more than 2-1 ratio, and Vandeveld has been put on the defensive  by allegations that optometrists who wanted to do business with the  15,000-member retail clerk's union headed by his father were asked to donate  $500 each to his campaign.  </P> <P> In a sign of Mojonnier's potential weakness, she has three GOP challengers --  former Del Mar Mayor Ronnie Delaney, La Jolla businesswoman Fay McGrath and  Poway school board member Stan Rodkin -- in her bid for nomination for a fifth  two-year Assembly term. Her opponents' hopes have been buoyed by a series of  ethics-related controversies plaguing Mojonnier, an Encinitas resident.  </P> <P> In February, for instance, she agreed to pay a $13,200 fine for double-billing  the state and her campaign committee for business trips, as well as for using  political donations to pay for fashion and beauty treatments for her staff.  Along with other state legislators, she also was criticized this year for  routinely using state-paid sergeants-at-arms for personal tasks, such as  chauffeuring her children and escorting her home after evening parties.  </P> <P> An issue from Mojonnier's last campaign -- her 1987 acceptance of a $10,000  speaking fee from the California Police Officers Assn. after leaving her  sickbed to vote for a new Los Angeles prison -- also could have a lingering  effect. Though the state attorney general's office ruled that the award did not  violate state law, opponents argue that it at least raised ethical questions.  </P> <P> "If not dead meat, Mojonnier's close to it," said political consultant Tom  Shepard.  </P> <P> Though acknowledging that she takes her primary challenge "very, very  seriously," Mojonnier said she is confident that she will retain her party's  nomination -- a scenario based in part on the hope that her three opponents  will splinter the anti-incumbent vote.  </P> <P> Former Del Mar Mayor Delaney concedes the likelihood of a divided vote, but  adds that the four-candidate race also reflects "the strong level of  dissatisfaction with the incumbent."  </P> <P> Political consultant Jim Johnston argues that Mojonnier's own woes will make it  difficult for her to separate herself from what he predicts will be a strong  anti-incumbent backlash.  </P> <P> "Even if you conduct yourself with all due ethical and personal decorum, this  is a tough time to be an incumbent because of the kind of news that's been  coming out of Sacramento and Washington," Johnston said. "If you're caught up  in one of these messes yourself, you're obviously in much deeper trouble. I  think the dissatisfaction has built up to the point that people feel it's time  for a change, that whomever they put in has to be better."  </P> <P> Both Chacon and Bates face similar problems in their Democratic primaries.  </P> <P> The 64-year-old Chacon, first elected to the Assembly in 1970, in recent years  has hinted that he was contemplating retirement, an inclination that some  within his party privately suggest he should have followed. A recent California  Journal article ranked Chacon next to last in overall effectiveness in the  Assembly, and he has drawn increasing criticism for spending less time in San  Diego than he does in a home he owns in Placerville, near Sacramento.  </P> <P> Another controversy surrounding Chacon involves his acceptance of $7,500 in  honorariums from a check cashers' organization in 1988 after he abandoned  legislation opposed by the group. More than half of the money -- $4,000 -- came  on the same day that the bill was shelved. Though the state attorney general's  office concluded that there was insufficient evidence to charge Chacon with a  bribe -- he insists the timing of the payments was a coincidence and did not  prompt him to drop the bill -- his critics contend that the gift places Chacon  in the same murky ethical waters as Mojonnier.  </P> <P> Chacon downplays his opposition as "part of the democratic process" and claims  to be "invigorated" by the challenge.  </P> <P> The toughest of his two foes is expected to be Celia Ballesteros, who enjoys  high name recognition and fund-raising capability as a former San Diego city  councilwoman. Ballesteros, in fact, out-raised Chacon, $41,559 to $27,549, from  Jan. 1 to March 17. And she is expected to receive an additional fund-raising  boost from abortion-rights groups that oppose Chacon's consistent anti-abortion  record.  </P> <P> The third candidate in the 79th District Democratic race -- John Warren, the  editor of a black community newspaper -- is regarded as a long shot. But the  votes he siphons from the two front-runners could affect the outcome.  </P> <P> Bates, meanwhile, was widely seen as vulnerable in the general election because  of his rebuke by the House Ethics Committee last year for sexually harassing  two female staff members. What came as a surprise was the serious primary  challenge the four-term Democrat faces from Byron Georgiou, a lawyer and  longtime party activist.  </P> <P> Arguing that Bates' sanction by the Ethics Committee has severely weakened him,  Georgiou contends that the Democrats will have a better chance of retaining  Bates' seat in November if the incumbent is not the party's nominee. Few  Democratic leaders, however, share his analysis.  </P> <P> "I think Byron may be burning some bridges," said San Diego Democratic Party  Chairman Irma Munoz. "Any time you challenge your own party's incumbent, there  are consequences."  </P> <P> Nonetheless, many feel that even if Georgiou loses his uphill campaign, he  probably will not have irreparably harmed his long-term political goals -- a  belief founded on the premise that, increasingly, candidates have little to  fear from party leaders' displeasure.  </P></p>

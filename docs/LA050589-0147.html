			<p><P> May 5, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY COLLEGE BASEBALL;  </P> <P> GOLDEN WEST RALLIES TO DROP RANCHO SANTIAGO  </P> <P> Rancho Santiago College, which had turned the Orange Empire Conference baseball  race into a stumbling contest of late, finally fell out of first place  Thursday.  </P> <P> Rancho Santiago started the day tied for first place, but Golden West rallied  for two runs in the ninth to defeat the Dons, 10-9.  </P> <P> Cypress defeated Saddleback, 7-5, Thursday to move into first place alone with  one game left.  </P> <P> Cypress (30-13 overall and 16-7 in the conference) is now a half-game ahead of  Orange Coast (29-11-1, 16-8) and one game ahead of Rancho Santiago (26-25,  15-8), which has lost three of its past four games. The winner of the  conference gets an automatic bid into the Southern California Regional  playoffs.  </P> <P> Fullerton plays at Cypress, and Rancho Santiago is at Saddleback Saturday at  noon. OCC has a bye.  </P> <P> Rancho Santiago took a 9-8 lead into the ninth, but Golden West got to reliever  Chris Floth, who had pitched four shutout innings.  </P> <P> Floth got Craig Paquette, Golden West's best hitter, to pop up to start the  inning.  </P> <P> Josh Bammer then walked and was replaced by pinch-runner Scott Turner. Turner  advanced to second on a passed ball, and scored on a single by Jeff Repoz.  </P> <P> Repoz stole second and scored on a single up the middle by Dan Villegas to put  Golden West ahead, 10-9. Floth (0-1) took the loss.  </P> <P> Dave Turner retired the first two batters in the ninth, but Joey Townsend  doubled to give Rancho Santiago a final chance. But pinch-hitter George Saldana  grounded out to end the game.  </P> <P> Turner (5-3) replaced Golden West starter Toby Foreman in the sixth and didn't  allow a run in the final four innings.  </P> <P> "We made too many mistakes today," Rancho Santiago Coach Don Sneddon said. "We  let them get into too many situations they could take advantage of."  </P> <P> Bammer had a sacrifice fly and Repoz hit a two-run home run in the first for  Golden West. Marty Neff hit a three-run home in the first for Rancho Santiago  to tie it, 3-3. It was the team-leading 11th home run for Neff.  </P> <P> Golden West scored single runs in the second and third, but Rancho Santiago  scored four runs in the fourth to take a 7-5 lead.  </P> <P> Golden West got a two-run home run from Paquette and a solo home run from  Bammer in the fifth to take an 8-7 lead. It was the 12th home run for Paquette,  and the sixth for Bammer.  </P> <P> After Bammer's home run, Rancho Santiago starter Willie Navarrette was replaced  by Floth.  </P> <P> Rancho Santiago tied it, 8-8, in the fifth on an RBI double by Louie Maldonado  and went ahead, 9-8, on an RBI single by Neff in the sixth.  </P> <P> Cypress 7, Saddleback 5 -- Visiting Cypress scored six runs in the second to  take control. The first two came on an error, then Jason Friedman and Brett  Gregory had RBI singles and Ken Kendrena had a two-run double to cap the  inning. Steve Gill and Friedman had back-to-back doubles for Cypress' final run  in the sixth.  </P> <P> Dennis Burbank (12-4) pitched 8 2/3 for the victory. Rich Lodding got the save.  Brent Ferguson hit two home runs, his fourth and fifth, for Saddleback  (16-17-1, 8-14-1).  </P> <P> Orange Coast 9, Fullerton 4 -- OCC scored five unearned runs in the ninth to  break a 4-4 tie at Fullerton. Marty Cordova drove in the final three runs of  the ninth with triple. Jason Young had a three-run home run for Orange Coast.  Eddie Pierce (4-1) got the victory. Mike Segovia had a solo homer for Fullerton  (7-16, 12-26).  </P></p>

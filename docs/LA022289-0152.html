			<p><P> February 22, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> SAMMY DAVIS JR. COOKS UP SIDELINE  </P> <P> Sammy Davis Jr., who stars with Gregory Hines in the current movie "Tap," is  starting a new line -- a line of food products.  </P> <P> Davis will hit supermarket shelves in April with his own brand of barbecue  sauce, chili and mustard. The products will appear first in Pennsylvania and  Ohio, then go national in the fall. "The mustard is tangy, but not too hot,"  said Davis. "The sauce has a nice little twang to it, but not too much, enough  so that you can taste it." Davis' venture into cuisine follows a similar move  by actor Paul Newman, whose face appears on his popcorn, spaghetti sauce,  lemonade and salad dressing.  </P></p>

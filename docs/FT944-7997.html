			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Better schools for all When the government first published league tables of school and college performance in English public examinations two years ago, the move was highly controversial. Enlightenment has now triumphed, and the Labour party has renounced its opposition to the publication of performance yardsticks. The challenge now is for politicians, irrespective of party, to develop policies to improve the lamentable results achieved by the bottom fifth of Britain's schools. If extended to other government educational reforms, Labour's change of heart may foster a welcome consensus on the basic structure of England's education system. League tables are the first step. The next should be a Labour commitment to preserve the autonomy of grant-maintained schools, while vesting the government's necessary reserve powers in local education authorities. If Labour also bites the bullet of student finance, it could even lead the education debate for the first time in the past decade. The recent report of the party's social justice commission rightly recommended that students should contribute to the cost of their tuition. It will not be possible to sustain quality higher education without such a reform - unless other vital parts of the education system, notably schools, are to be starved of resources. Yesterday's performance tables emphasise the work to be done at the pre-18 level. Although for the second year running the tables show improvements in both GCSE and A-level performance, it is still the case that well under half of England's 16-year-olds achieved at least five C grades at GCSE. Truancy rates Furthermore, that proportion - unacceptably low if Britain is to become a high-skill economy in the foreseeable future - masks abysmal performance by a significant minority of schools. Some inner city authorities reported results barely half as good as the national average, with alarming truancy rates and individual schools achieving hardly any GCSE passes at high grades. There are, of course, explanations aplenty. But none of them are of any help to the children whose employment prospects are blighted by being unable to function in jobs requiring basic numeracy and literacy. The publication of exam results has helped to focus attention on the problem: in some cases that attention alone has been a stimulant to improvement. But in more it has simply exposed a failure which continues from year to year. What is to be done? A host of government policies is on the table or in operation, notably the rapid development of vocational qualifications to cater for the less academically able, greater autonomy for school head teachers and governors, more nursery education, more frequent school inspections with the threat of task forces for schools which fail to improve, and the provision of greater financial incentives for teachers. Greater autonomy Greater autonomy is valuable to successful schools; but it often exacerbates the failure of the less successful. For that reason, the principle behind the plan to send task forces into schools which are seriously failing is sound. The government has yet to use its powers to do so. It should not flinch from taking such action. Only a small number of schools can be tackled by task forces. For the rest, the development of nursery education and vocational qualifications are vital priorities. It will not be easy to fund universal nursery provision, and there are valid concerns about the new General National Vocational Qualifications. But it would be a mistake to slow the pace of reform: all four-year-olds should have access to a nursery place, and all secondary-age pupils should have the option of taking rigorous vocational courses instead of more traditional academic routes through school and college. However, there is no use in pretending that educational reforms alone will improve the lot of failing schools. The problems they face are as much social as educational - rooted in poverty, family breakdown, racial tension and urban blight. Most of the areas affected are run at local level by Labour councils. A new partnership is needed between teachers, councils and central government to improve inner city schools. If political parties could exploit their new common ground to that purpose, they would deserve a higher ranking in the public's estimation.</p>

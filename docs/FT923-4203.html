			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Europe and America slip down coal league EUROPE AND North America, which a decade ago accounted for two-thirds of world coal production and trade, now account for less than half, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe says in a report on coal market trends and prospects in the region. The ECE area also became a net coal importer in 1991 and is expected to remain one this year, due mainly to lower exports from eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Global hard coal consumption and production both fell last year to below 3.5bn tonnes, reflecting a steep decline in eastern European output and a smaller drop in the US. US output is expected to rebound this year, alongside a 1 per cent rise in world production, but demand and production will fall in both halves of Europe in 1992, the ECE says. The drop in ECE coal use to about 1.7bn tonnes last year took its share of world demand to less than 50 per cent for the first time, and the declining trend is likely to continue, the report says. The ECE is predicting that hard coal consumption in Asia, already 45 per cent of the world total, will rise by 2 per cent a year, double the growth rate forecast for the ECE region. The slow growth in coal use in Europe and North America stems mainly from economic and environmental pressures with, in eastern Europe, the additional problems arising from transition to market-based economies.</p>

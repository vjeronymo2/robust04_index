			<p>BFN     [Text] Geneva, May 2 KYODO -- Health and Welfare Minister  Keigo Ouchi, who is chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party  (DSP), said Monday [2 May] he is against the idea of holding  general elections under the existing system of multi-seat  constituencies. He said the government of Prime Minister  Tsutomu Hata has been born amid the electoral system reform  movement and that he does not see any need to hold the next  general elections under "the old system" which will be replaced  by a new electoral system for the House of Representatives.    Ouchi made the remarks at a news conference after arriving  in  Geneva to attend a general meeting of the World Health  Organization.    The new electoral system features a combination of 300  single-seat constituencies and 200 proportional representation  seats and reduces the total number of lower house seats from the  current 511.    Asked to comment on Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]  Secretary  General Ichiro Ozawa, a backroom strategist of the coalition  government, Ouchi said Ozawa is "high-handed" when it comes to  the democratic process. "(His) initiatives for welfare tax and  a cabinet reshuffle were not at times appropriate," Ouchi said,  referring to the botched schemes which widened the division  within the coalition government of former Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa.</p>

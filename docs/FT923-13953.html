			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Eurocamp on target with 15% volume rise EUROCAMP, the self-drive camping holidays group which went public a year ago, said its 1992 season bookings had been up to target, with volumes more than 15 per cent ahead. Mr Tom Neville, chairman, said that margins would be slightly lower, so profits growth would not match sales increases. The group also announced the expected pre-tax loss of Pounds 4.96m (Pounds 5.25m) for the six months to April 30 on sales of Pounds 450,000 (Pounds 164,000). The interim dividend is 3.45p, which is 15 per cent up on the notional dividend the group would have paid had it been a quoted company at the time. Mr Neville said the French lorry drivers blockade had not prevented most of the group's customers reaching their destinations. Cancellations had not risen, although bookings had been affected since the blockade began. However, more than 95 per cent of bookings had already been taken. Mr Neville said he did not expect a material affect on profits. EuroDisney bookings were running at about 70 to 75 per cent of capacity, which would give a broadly neutral impact on profits.</p>

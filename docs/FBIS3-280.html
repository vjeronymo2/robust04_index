			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kenyan Foreign Minister Stephen Musyoka today ended  a three-day official visit to Mozambique at the invitation of  his counterpart, Dr. Pascoal Mocumbi. During his visit, Mr.  Musyoka held talks with Dr. Pascoal Mocumbi on bilateral  cooperation between Mozambique and Kenya.    The two countries cooperate in the fields of health,  culture,  agriculture, trade, and education. An agreement for the purpose  was signed between the two countries in 1991 when Mozambican  President Joaquim Chissano paid a visit to Kenya.    During the talks in Maputo, the two sides decided to create  a  joint commission aimed at boosting their cooperation. Kenya has  offered to host the first meeting of the commission in Nairobi  on a date to be announced. The Kenyan foreign minister abruptly  canceled a news conference he was scheduled to give in Maputo  this morning on the last day of his visit, claiming that he had  other businesses at the same time, which could not be postponed.</p>

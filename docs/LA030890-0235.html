			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FCC MAY GIVE AT&amp;T MORE FREEDOM TO VIE WITH ITS RIVALS  </P> <P> The Federal Communications Commission today proposed to loosen its regulation  of AT&amp;T, saying the one-time phone monopoly now faces "significant  competition" in the interstate long-distance marketplace.  </P> <P> The commission, in a 4-0 vote, adopted a staff proposal that, if finally  approved, would give the American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. some of the  freedom it says it needs to maneuver against competitors such as MCI  Communications Corp. and US Sprint.  </P> <P> The FCC last year gave AT&amp;T a major deregulatory victory when it dumped its  20-year rate-of-return regulation of AT&amp;T's profits in exchange for a  system that controls AT&amp;T's prices within certain limits tied to the rate  of inflation.  </P> <P> The commission proposed phased-in changes in certain business services,  extending later to 800 services, international messaging and operator services.  </P></p>

			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Government Bonds: JGBs at six-year high as Nikkei falls below 19,000 JAPANESE government bonds climbed to a six-year high yesterday, taking their cue from the weakness of the Tokyo stock market and the generally gloomy economic background. The December futures contract opened at 114.98 and rose to a high of 115.29 before ending Tokyo trading at 115.20. In the cash market, the No 145 JGB's yield opened at 3.505 per cent and closed at 3.43 per cent, corresponding to the high price of the day. The trigger for the bond rally was the sharp decline in the Nikkei 225 average index, which dropped 431.45 to end below the psychologically important 19,000 level at 18,949.79 for the first time in eight months. The stock market's weakness kindled hopes of a further easing in open money market interest rates. The overnight call rate is currently at 2.5 per cent, while the rate on three-month certificates of deposit slipped a further 2 basis points to 2.34 per cent yesterday. Both rates are expected to slip lower in the near future, dealers said. 'There's been a lot more concern about the state of the economy in recent weeks, and net new money which would have gone into equities has found a home in bonds instead, given the economic environment,' said Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International. He added that if the economy is still very weak in the second quarter of next year, it could possibly prompt another cut in the official discount rate (ODR), which is currently at 1.75 per cent. HIGH-YIELDING European government bond markets took a knock as domestic political and economic worries grabbed the attention of investors. Italian government bonds suffered a sharp fall in the wake of new corruption allegations. Although President Scalfaro made an unexpected television appearance late on Wednesday in order to deny the allegations, dealers said the market appeared nervous, wiping out the previous day's gains. The December BTP contract on Liffe settled at 115.19, against its opening level of 115.90. Rumours circulated that the Italian Treasury may issue 30-year lira government bonds, helping to extend the maturity profile of the domestic debt market. According to a report from Reuter, the 30-year issue would be for L2,000bn and would carry the same 9 per cent coupon as the recent 10-year issues. However, dealers pointed that in order to make the issue attractive to investors, the bonds would have to be offered at a discount, thereby providing investors with a pick-up in yield over the 10-year government issue. SHORT-DATED UK government bonds outperformed the long end of the market, buoyed by hopes of a cut in the base rate, possibly around the time of the November 30 Budget. Dealers said that shortening trades were the main theme of the day. The 7 1/4 per cent gilt due 1998 rose  1/8 to trade at 104 5/16 by late afternoon. Meanwhile, long-dated issues held steady as dealers pointed out that concerns about inflation have abated slightly. Earlier this week, the governor of the Bank of England, called for companies to help curb inflation by generating higher profits through increased output and capacity use, rather than higher prices. Mr Simon Briscoe of SG Warburg Securities said the market was encouraged by the governor's speech and that this week's news of a supermarket price war is also likely to be good for gilts, as it should help to subdue inflation. THE German government bond market ended little changed as the Bundesbank left its key interest rates untouched at yesterday's council meeting. In the absence of interesting domestic economic data, dealers said the bund market is likely to be watching today's release of the US employment data with keen interest. LONGER-dated US Treasury securities dropped sharply in heavy futures-led selling as a nervous bond market readied itself for today's jobs data. In late trading, the 30-year government bond was down 1 3/8 at 100 9/16, yielding 6.203 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was down 3/32 at 99 7/16, to yield 4.156 per cent. News of a 10,000 decline in weekly jobless claims contributed to early losses at the long end, primarily because attention was focused on the October employment report, due today. The jobless claims data hinted that labour market conditions are continuing to improve, albeit gradually. Prices dropped even further during the afternoon as selling led by the futures market sent the long bond into a tailspin. Analysts are predicting that the jobs report will show a 160,000 rise in non-farm payrolls, but there were plenty in the market who believed the figure will be much higher.</p>

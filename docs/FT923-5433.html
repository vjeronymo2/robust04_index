			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / MPs warn against collusion over bank charges THE POSSIBILITY of an agreement among the big four high street banks to phase out free banking was greeted with warnings yesterday from MPs across the House of Commons against possible collusion. Mr John Watts, the Tory chairman of the all-party Treasury committee of MPs, expressed unease at the idea of more extensive charges being introduced in concerted action by the banks. Recalling the committee's inquiry into the banks' relationship with small business customers, he said that if there were widespread moves to introduce new charges, the MPs might well want to look at the matter. 'It is certainly potentially a topic we might want to look at if there were a substantial change in the basis of banks' charges.' His remarks came as Barclays, the biggest UK high street bank, confirmed that plans to reintro- duce charges for many current account holders were 'on the agenda'. The other three main banks also indicated over the weekend that they were considering similar steps. Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour's consumer affairs spokesman, has already written to the Office of Fair Trading asking it to investigate whether there was collusion against the public interest in the banks' plans. Although Barclays, which has 6.5m current account holders, has no plans 'at the moment' to introduce charges on accounts in credit, an official said 'we are conscious that there is an imbalance between the 80 per cent who pay no current account charges and those that are overdrawn'. Over the weekend Mr Brian Pearse, chief executive of Midland Bank, said there was no point in providing current account holders who never paid charges with a service. 'Over time, hopefully, we'll persuade our customers you don't get anything for nothing,' Mr Pearse said. Midland has 4.5m current account customers, of which two-thirds do not pay charges. A Midland official said yesterday that Mr Pearse's remarks were general and long-term. National Westminster and Lloyds also intimated they believed the days of free banking in credit may be numbered. 'If only a small minority of your customers are paying bank charges, it's something you look at,' an official at NatWest said. Lloyds said UK customers with a current account took free banking for granted but that Lloyds had more than 4m current account customers, of which more than 70 per cent were effectively subsidised by the minority who became overdrawn.

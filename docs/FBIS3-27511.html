			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "Zhang Junsheng Stresses That If British Side </F> Publishes Contents of Talks, Chinese Side Will Make  Corresponding Response"]    [Text] If the British side unilaterally releases details  of the Sino-British talks, the Chinese side will definitely  respond accordingly, Zhang Junsheng, deputy director of the  XINHUA News Agency Hong Kong Branch, said today. Releasing the  records of the Sino-British talks will do no credit to Chris  Patten, he noted.    Present at the 1994 International Calligraphy Exhibition  yesterday, Zhang Junsheng said: We never objected to any  arrangement to release the records of the 17 rounds of talks  between China and Britain on the arrangements for the 1994-95  elections in Hong Kong. But, at the beginning of the talks, the  Chinese and British sides agreed to keep the contents of the  talks secret, and if the contents are to be released, this  should only be done after prior consent is reached between the  two sides through diplomatic channels. The British side first  said that the contents of the talks would be released by the  British Hong Kong Government. But now they say that they will  be jointly released by the British Government and the British  Hong Kong Government. This move that the British Hong Kong  Government is going to make indicates that they has gone farther  and farther on the road against cooperation.    Zhang Junsheng added that it was a natural outcome for the  British side to take this step. Chris Patten provoked disputes  as soon as the talks started. During the talks, the British  side played many little tricks to interfere in and undermine the  talks. Finally, the British side unilaterally terminated the  talks, and tabled the so-called constitutional reform package in  the Legislative Council [Legco]. Thus the talks terminated and  broke down.    Zhang Junsheng said: We never hoped to see disputes break  out. During the talks, we upheld the principle of the "three  conformities" and we hoped to reach an agreement with the  British side. However, the British side unilaterally terminated  the talks and quit the negotiating table. In spite of this, we  still wish to see the British side return to the negotiating  table, of course, on condition that the part of the  constitutional reform package that has already been tabled to  Legco is withdrawn before talks are resumed according to the  principle of the "three conformities." It is a pity that the  British side has now gone farther and farther.</p>

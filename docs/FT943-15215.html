			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Management: Trying to unlock the treasure within I am a normal person. I know this because a career counsellor has just told me so. The other day I received a Perspex treasure chest bearing an invitation to a 'dynamic afternoon of career psychodrama and hands-on interaction using a myriad of state-of-the-art techniques, presented by the experts, KPMG Career Consultancy'. Thus it was that last Tuesday I found myself having my behaviour assessed, my lifeline read, my self-image examined in the company of solemn personnel directors from some of Britain's biggest companies. The 'state-of-the-art techniques' revealed variously that I am impatient (I knew this already), that I will never be the life and soul of the party (which I was distressed to discover) that I like being in control (I have been told as much before) and that I do whatever I'm told (which was news to me). My first visit was to the image counsellor, who handed me some crayons and a large piece of paper. 'Draw anything, an island, your family, anything,' she said. I drew a picture of myself in a taxi in a tunnel - an image I chose because cars are the only thing I can draw and because the picture described my most recent journey. 'That is a very strong image. It must be very strongly felt,' she said, looking over my shoulder. She then asked if I was 'expecting', and suggested that my anger at the situation might be to do with protecting the unborn child. I said I very much doubted it, and she reminded me that the point of these pictures was to bring hidden emotions to the surface. A second expert invited me to plot my lifeline, marking the main events in my personal and professional life as highs or lows on a chart. I had trouble even beginning this exercise. I couldn't decide whether being born was a high or a low point - as far as I can remember (which is not at all) it wasn't really either. I should have performed better with the computer, which asked me to write an imaginary newspaper headline and story about myself. But my mind went blank when it came to thinking up a sufficiently newsworthy future achievement. Finally I replied to 108 repetitive questions asking whether my friends told me their closest secrets and whether they included me in their activities. According to this psychometric test my behaviour is 'really quite normal'. There can be no doubt about it: this career psychodrama was more diverting than an afternoon in the office. But I am not sure how I would have felt about it had I been attending under normal circumstances. Usually the exercise takes a full week, and is paid for by companies as a parting gift to employees they are about to get rid of. KPMG describes its exercise as follows: 'In life as in career the treasure is really you. How to unlock it is the thing.' I am sorry to have to report that the treasure that is really me remains as firmly locked up as ever. I can't even open the Perspex chest they sent me. A friend has just supplied me with a good working definition of empowerment. His organisation has just jumped on that bandwagon, and when I saw him last weekend he was not looking good: pale and tired and drinking heavily. 'Empowerment,' he said, 'is when your boss gives you all the boring parts of his job to do, and works half as hard himself.' Clare Spottiswoode may be wishing she had never heard of the job of gas regulator. Bad enough was that nonsense a few weeks ago about her private life, worse is the news that her architect husband has now turned down a small contract with British Gas simply because of his wife's position. It seems most unfair. He has worked for British Gas in the past, long before his wife became involved in the industry. Moreover, the department which awarded him the business this time did not know there was any link between them. Yet Spottiswoode understandably felt there was too much to lose. Her job depends on being seen to be impartial, and snide remarks about her protecting her husband's interests would not have been helpful. This is no one-off case. There must be hundreds of couples where one is in public life, and the other working in a related area. Equally, there must be hundreds of potential conflicts, some of which are harmless, others less so. To have a blanket ban on a family member working in any area in which their other half wields power would be ludicrous. It would also make jobs in officialdom even less attractive than they are already. Some people, Margaret Thatcher for one, have the personality and the power to tough it out when members of the family manoeuvre themselves into potentially compromising positions. But lesser officials need more protection and guidance. One solution might be to set up a body to look at individual cases. And yet there is something about a regulator that regulates the regulators that does not quite appeal.</p>

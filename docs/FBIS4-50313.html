			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Central People's Radio Network reporter Liu Zhenying </F> (0491 2182 5391) and XINHUA reporter Sun Benyao (1327 2609 1031)]    [Text] Beijing, 26 Apr (XINHUA) -- Anhui's economic  achievement exhibition opened today at the National Culture  Palace in Beijing.    Prior to the opening of the exhibition, Jiang Zemin, general  secretary of the CPC Central Committee and president; Qiao Shi,  member of the Political Bureau Standing Committee of the CPC  Central Committee and chairman of the National People's Congress  Standing Committee; Li Ruihuan, member of the Political Bureau  Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee and chairman of  the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, visited  the exhibition, respectively. Premier Li Peng inscribed the  name of the exhibition before he left to visit foreign countries.    The exhibition conveys through different perspectives  Anhui's  economic achievements since China adopted the policy of reform  and opening up, particularly the recovery and development of  Anhui's economy since it was hit by a major flood in 1991. At  the same time, it also shows the general condition of its  economic development and its potential and bright prospects for  economic development. It is the first time that Anhui has held  such a large-scale exhibition in the capital since the founding  of New China.    Anhui has not only recovered from the 1991 flood in a short  time, but has also scored great developments in economic  construction and in social undertakings. Anhui's GNP grew 17  percent and its social development general index rose 30 percent  in 1992. The momentum of rapid and healthy development  continued and sustained in 1993. Anhui's GNP was up 22 percent  in 1993 from the previous year and its development speed ranked  top in the nation.    In the evening of 24 April, General Secretary Jiang Zemin,  accompanied by Lu Rongjing, Anhui provincial CPC committee  secretary, and Governor Fu Xishou, visited the exhibition with  great enthusiasm. He closely watched videos, display objects,  models, and photos at different exhibition booths. He  attentively listened to briefings of relevant personnel.  Whenever he was told of a particular economic achievement that  Anhui has achieved in recent years, he would nod to show his  satisfaction. After touring the scenes of the exhibition, Jiang  Zemin spoke to Anhui's leading comrades: "Please do an even  better job; the future of Anhui is very promising."    Chairmen Qiao Shi and Li Ruihuan visited the exhibition on  the morning of 25 April and 26 April, respectively. They were  both pleased with the achievements in economic construction and  in social undertakings that Anhui has scored over the last two  years. After viewing the exhibition, Qiao Shi said the  exhibition showed great changes in Anhui and he was greatly  impressed by those changes. Li Ruihuan said Anhui's fast  recovery from a major disaster is really a rare feat. This  fully shows the Chinese Communist Party possesses a cohesive  force and the superiority of the socialist system. He added  that the most important experience that one gains from the rapid  and healthy development of Anhui's economy is that Anhui knows  how to seize and to give play to its own characteristics and  superiority.    Those present at the opening ceremony of the exhibition  included leading comrades Li Ruihuan, Sun Qimen, and Li Guixian;  persons in charge of organs directly under the CPC Central  Committee, of some departments of the party and state organs, of  relevant departments of the People's Liberation Army; and people  from various circles in Beijing, and foreign guests.    In his opening address, Fu Xishou said Anhui's victory over  the 1991 flood and in the subsequent flood-relief work was made  possible by the Anhui people's hard work. He added that the  victory was made all the more possible because of the superior  socialist system. It was the result of the great concern and  great support, both spiritually and materially, given by the CPC  Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military  Commission. It was also the result of the concern and  assistance rendered by the party, the government, the military,  and the people in the capital; the people throughout the nation;  and overseas compatriots. The purpose of holding such an  exhibition in Beijing, he said, is to express the sincere  gratitude of the Anhui people and to publicize Anhui, so as to  accelerate the pace of economic construction and the  modernization drive in Anhui.    Those who attended the opening ceremony toured the scenes of  the exhibition. The exhibition was divided into 16 sections  showing Anhui's achievements in agriculture, village and  township enterprises, metallurgy industry, petrochemical  industry, machinery industry, electronic industry, science and  technology, and foreign trade.    State Councillor Luo Gan and other leading comrades also  visited the exhibition prior to the opening ceremony.    The exhibition will close on 2 May.</p>

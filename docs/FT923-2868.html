			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Japan's prosecutors pursue 'kingmaker' JAPANESE prosecutors insisted yesterday that Mr Shin Kanemaru, the 'kingmaker' of the ruling Liberal Democratic party, will be formally investigated over whether his receipt of Y500m (Pounds 2.1m) from a scandal-tainted trucking company was in breach of political funding laws. Doubt over Mr Kanemaru's future has unsettled the ruling party, which presumed that its former vice-chairman would not be pursued. Mr Kanemaru, head of the party's largest faction, also thought he would not be formally questioned, and last week refused to travel to the Tokyo prosecutor's office. But investigators have grown impatient with Mr Kanemaru, and appear to have leaked details of the donation and his alleged links to a gangster group that were widely broadcast on Japanese television stations last night. The information had clearly been gathered by prosecutors during questioning of Mr Hiroyasu Watanabe, the former president of Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin, the parcel delivery company at the centre of an unfolding saga of massive payments to politicians and government officials. Mr Kanemaru has admitted that his office received the Y500m, but said the funds were 'goodwill money' for the party and were not in breach of the Political Funds Control Law. However, the amount is far beyond the Y100m allowed to be donated by a company to one party under the law, which has a maximum fine of only Y200,000. To show his remorse, Mr Kanemaru resigned as party vice-chairman, and yet suffered no loss of power within the party. However, his ability to raise funds, which sustains his status within the party, could be hurt by the separate allegations yesterday that he asked gangsters to end protests against LDP leaders by far-right groups. By raising the gangster issue, prosecutors are attempting to embarrass Mr Kanemaru into making an appearance at their office this week. His assistants say he is preparing a written explanation for the prosecutors, but they want him to make an appearance in person. The possibility of Mr Kanemaru's reputation suffering serious damage from the scandal has prompted a power struggle within his faction. Meanwhile, the 'kingmaker' is said to have spent much of the past few days at his home playing mah-jong, the Chinese game of chance.</p>

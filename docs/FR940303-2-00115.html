The Order to Show Cause proposed to revoke Dr. Azen's DEA Certificate of Registration, AA8786329, under 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(2) and (a)(4), and deny any pending applications for renewal of such registration under 21 U.S.C. 823(f) for reason that his continued registration would be inconsistent with the public interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Respondent, through counsel, requested a hearing on the issues raised by the Order to Show Cause, and the matter was docketed before Administrative Law Judge Mary Ellen Bittner. Following prehearing procedures, a hearing was held on Los Angeles, California, beginning on January 6, 1993. On October 18, 1993, in her opinion and recommended ruling, findings of fact, conclusions of law, and decision, the administrative law judge recommended that the Administrator revoke Respondent's DEA Certificate of Registration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On November 2, 1993, the Respondent filed exceptions to Judge Bittner's opinion pursuant to 21 CFR 1316.66, and on November 18, 1993, the administrative law judge transmitted the record to the Acting Administrator. The Acting Administrator has carefully considered the entire record in this matter and, pursuant to 21 CFR 1316.67, hereby issues his final order in this matter based upon findings of fact and conclusions of law as hereinafter set forth. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The administrative law judge found that the Respondent is an emergency room physician who received his medical degree in 1978 from Loma Linda University of Medicine in Loma Linda, California. Following an internship at the University of Southern California, and his service of two residencies in emergency medicine and internal medicine, Respondent worked at the Medical Center of North Hollywood from 1982 until 1991, and as of the date of the administrative hearing was employed at Pacifica Hospital in Los Angeles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The administrative law judge found that on September 20, 1990, Los Angeles Police Department officers received a report that a woman had died at Respondent's home, apparently from a drug overdose. The administrative law judge found that when the officers arrived at the Respondent's residence, they were advised by the Respondent that the deceased was his girl friend, and that earlier in the evening Respondent and the deceased had consumed alcohol, smoked marijuana, and snorted cocaine. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One of the officers present at Respondent's house on that evening testified at the administrative hearing that the police officers found inside Respondent's home two 5- by 7-inch cards with white powder on them and four small straws in a trash can, powder on the bedboard, and glasses containing what appeared to be alcohol residue. The officer further testified that although the items were seized, to his knowledge, no tests were conducted on them. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The administrative law judge found that as a result of reports regarding the death of Respondent's girl friend, the Medical Board of California (Board) initiated an investigation of the Respondent. One of the Board investigators that participated in the investigation also testified at the administrative hearing. Interviews were conducted of various law enforcement officials, including the pathologist who examined the Respondent's deceased girl friend. The pathologist estimated that, at the time of the girl friend's death, there was approximately 20 times a fatal quantity of cocaine in her system, and, in addition, a large quantity of cocaine metabolites. The Board investigator also interviewed the Los Angeles County coroner, who found a large amount of cocaine in the deceased's personal property. The coroner further stated that Respondent told the coroner that Respondent and the deceased commonly used cocaine and alcohol on their days off. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board investigator interviewed the sister of the deceased, who revealed to the investigator that she used cocaine with Respondent and the deceased on numerous occasions. The deceased's sister informed the Board investigator of her knowledge that Respondent sold cocaine and that she had purchased it from him in the past. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board investigator also interviewed two acquaintances of the Respondent, both of whom admitted purchasing cocaine from the Respondent on various occasions. One of the individuals stated that for a two to three year period, Respondent was his sole source of cocaine, that he purchased cocaine in half gram quantities from the Respondent, and that the Respondent made no profit from his sales. The individual went on to state that Respondent had a very high tolerance for cocaine, and carried a small vial of it with him, however he never saw Respondent use cocaine while working. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

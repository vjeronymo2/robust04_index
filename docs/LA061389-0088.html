			<p><P> June 13, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART BUCHWALD: WORKING OVERTIME AT THE RUMOR MILL  </P> <P> Just down the street from the Republican National Headquarters is a large,  dirty pool, where reporters and party workers relax after work and exchange  rumors about politicians. Some people call it mud-slinging, but it's really  good, old-fashioned jawboning that we all enjoy at the end of the day.  </P> <P> The mud can be supplied by anyone -- from a party secretary to a top-flight GOP  manager, who has access to the Oval Office.  </P> <P> This is how it went the other day: An aide came over from headquarters and  announced, "Congressman Meadowlark is a fly-chaser. Pass it on."  </P> <P> It seemed hard to believe except for the fact that we heard it with our own  ears.  </P> <P> The questions came out fast and furious.  </P> <P> "Has anyone ever seen him chase flies?"  </P> <P> "No, but the source was impeccable. A party intern heard it from his father,  who dated Meadowlark's sister's roommate."  </P> <P> "It can't be true," a reporter said, "but if I don't write about it, I'll catch  hell from my editor."  </P> <P> "Why don't you say, 'There is no truth to the rumor that a congressman, who is  chairman of a very important committee, was seen chasing flies in the halls of  Congress after dark'?"  </P> <P> The Republican mud-slinger told him, "I didn't say that he is a fly-chaser now.  I said that he was one in his youth."  </P> <P> "It doesn't make any difference," another reporter added. "I've always thought  that where there is smoke, there is unethical conduct. Why don't we ask  Meadowlark outright if he was one? If he denies it, it will be a bigger story  than if he admits the charge."  </P> <P> The person who leaked the information spoke up, "Don't mention where you got  it. Everyone around here is very touchy. The last time Mark Goodin, the PR  director, threw mud at Tom Foley, he was given the ax."  </P> <P> "He wasn't a very good sleaze-ball artist," I said. "Or he wouldn't have been  caught."  </P> <P> A network reporter told us, "We're wasting time. While we're in this dirty pool  the whole damn press corps is writing about Meadowlark's penchant for chasing  flies."  </P> <P> The Republican leaker reassured him, "Nobody knows about it but you guys. We  wanted to make sure that our friends were the ones to run him out of town."  </P> <P> "OK, so he likes to chase flies. Does that mean he can't do his job?" another  reporter asked.  </P> <P> The reporter next to him, Marilee Keefe, chimed in, "It's not for us to say  whether he can or not. Our only role is to make sure that the public knows  about it. If the other party wants a fly-chaser passing laws, good luck to  them."  </P> <P> I said, "My report will state that while there is absolutely no proof that  Meadowlark is the biggest fly-chaser in Washington, everyone in this town is  calling for his resignation."  </P> <P> Another newspaperman, who was working on his word processor at the end of the  pool, yelled, "Hey, what is the definition of a fly-chaser?"  </P> <P> His buddy answered, "My dictionary says, 'A fly-chaser is a baseball outfielder  who runs after balls.' "  </P> <P> Everybody in the pool was furious. One reporter spluttered, "They did it to us  again."  </P> <P> Lee Atwater came out of Republican Party headquarters and spoke to the group,  "I'm sorry, fellows. I have never seen such a dirty political story in my life,  and I am going to fire the person who circulated it, because I have to look at  myself in the mirror every morning."  </P></p>

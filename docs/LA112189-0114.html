			<p><P> November 21, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SOPRANO NEBLETT TURNS UP VOLUME, CAN'T MASK FAULTS  </P> <P> Each year, as an embellishment to its regular opera season, San Diego Opera  offers a handful of solo recitals. Unlike opera productions, these programs  represent more of a gamble for the music patron because they rely on the talent  of a single performer.  </P> <P> On a lucky night in February, 1988, for example, local opera buffs were  rewarded with the sophisticated, polished artistry of Swedish baritone Hakan  Hagegard. At Sunday night's Sherwood Auditorium recital by soprano Carol  Neblett, however, lady luck was not smiling.  </P> <P> Having made an auspicious Metropolitan Opera debut 10 years ago, Neblett should  be at the acme of her career. But, judging from the evidence of Sunday's  recital and her solo role in San Diego Opera's Verdi Requiem last season, this  diva is experiencing vocal mid-life crisis.  </P> <P> To compensate for a host of problems -- unreliable vocal production, shortness  of breath, an annoying vocal wobble -- Neblett simply cranked up the volume and  emoted to beat the band. By comparison, Shakespeare's Lady Macbeth is  positively catatonic.  </P> <P> A few times during her program, Neblett aptly fused her emotional excesses with  the demands of the music, notably in Massenet's fevered aria "Pleurez, pleurez  mes yeux," from "Le Cid," and in the despairing "My Man's Gone Now" from  Gershwin's "Porgy and Bess."  </P> <P> But her opening German-language songs by Mozart were unstylishly melodramatic;  Faure's evanescent "Apres un reve" has rarely been given such a loud, coarse  treatment, and Ravel's "Vocalise" received little more than an approximation of  its sinuous vocal line.  </P> <P> Neblett's most serious undertaking was a neo-Romantic song cycle by Thomas  Pasatieri, who also served as the soprano's accompanist. Pasatieri's "Sieben  Lehmannlieder," a fairly recent setting of seven poems by the late Lotte  Lehmann, proved agreeable and pleasantly eclectic, filled with the discreet  echoes of Poulenc, Wolf and Mahler.  </P> <P> Like his fellow American composer Samuel Barber, Pasatieri knows how to craft a  melody that is inherently sympathetic to the voice. Pasatieri played Mozart and  his own compositions fluently, but in the Massanet aria, his misreading of the  score made Neblett's work even harder.  </P> <P> The program's penultimate piece was Pasatieri's satirical song "Vocal Modesty,"  which begins with the line "I just love my voice." It may be quite possible to  love Neblett's grand, dramatic vocal instrument. But the manner is which she  now uses it is downright painful.  </P></p>

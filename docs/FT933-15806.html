			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / A shifting market to test their metal: German unions are trying to build a consensus while protecting their national rights Germany's IG Metall, the world's most powerful trade union, is an unsentimental organisation. Six weeks ago, its charismatic leader, Mr Franz Steinkuhler, was brought down by charges of insider trading. At a national conference on the future of pay bargaining one month later in Frankfurt his name was not mentioned once. But the conference did more than emphasise that it is business as usual for Germany's 3.3m-strong engineering union. It also signalled that Germany's industrial relations system, battered by the deepest economic crisis since the war, is groping back towards the rational and consensual habits for which it was once admired. The message to his members from 54-year-old Mr Klaus Zwickel, the new president of IG Metall, is clear: 'For the next few years the room for manoeuvre on wages is going to be very limited.' Union influence, he says, should be diverted into extending worker participation and influencing job structures. 'Above all the new priority for our members is securing jobs,' he adds. But here, too, Mr Zwickel is coldly realistic. He is armed with the hard facts about industry's plans for lay-offs and restructuring from union members who sit on the boards of Germany's biggest companies. Mr Zwickel accepts that German industry faces 'deep structural problems' and that manufacturing employment will fall 'sharply'. This is not just conciliatory rhetoric after a period of unusually direct industrial confrontation. As German manufacturing sheds thousands of jobs every week, pushing unemployment to 3.27m last month, the union is not protesting or threatening strikes, as its UK counterparts did with little success in the early 1980s. Confronted by rising dole queues, the unions have moderated their pay claims. April's engineering industry pay rise of 3 per cent will probably mean a small fall in real incomes for most IG Metall members this year. For Mr Zwickel and the German unions, it is a time for consolidation and even for tactical retreat, exemplified by recent IG Metall decisions to allow weekend working at one plant and a curtailment of benefits at a few others. Yet the unions are operating from a position of relative strength. In the 1980s, while organised labour was in retreat throughout the industrialised world, union membership levels in Germany held firm at about 35 per cent. German workers also moved to the top of the world's hourly pay league and, thanks to IG Metall's successful campaign for the 35-hour week, now work the fewest hours per year of all industrialised nations. The success story was crowned at the beginning of the 1990s by the wholesale transportation to east Germany of the west German industrial relations model: national bargaining and strong, industry-based unions combined with legally-backed works councils (with wide veto powers over management decisions) and workers on the board at company level. Such was the hold of the consensus model and the commitment to unification that German employers agreed in 1991 to equalise wages between east and west by 1994. Two years later the whole deal threatened to fall apart. The engineering industry employers tried unilaterally to revoke the wage deal. IG Metall, led by the physically imposing figure of Mr Zwickel, denounced the move as an attempt by the employers to use east Germany to try to break the entire national bargaining system and ultimately to bring down wage costs in the west. On May 3, he called his members out on strike. 'It was the first time in postwar German history that the employers had torn up an agreement,' Mr Zwickel says, his booming voice shaking with emotion at the memory. He maintains that both sides knew the real issue was not how quickly wages should be equalised but the sanctity of national agreements covering wages and conditions - what Mr Zwickel calls 'the living nerve of the German unions'. Union officials admit privately that equalisation of wages creates problems in an area like east Germany where there are huge differences in productivity between old and new plants. Some east German plants have productivity as low as 30 per cent of the west German average while, for example, General Motors' Eisenach plant has 150 per cent of western productivity. When the IG Metall strike ended three weeks later, the union agreed to a delay until 1996 in the wage equalisation goal. Crucially, it also accepted 'hardship clauses', allowing loss-making companies to opt out of the deal if the union agreed. Preserving the overall agreement in Germany, even with a two-year delay, was a timely triumph for Mr Zwickel, a 'metalworkers metalworker'. He organised the strike with real unemployment close to 50 per cent in east Germany. Most members in the east were more concerned with job security than seemingly arcane 'western' arguments about national agreements. Mr Zwickel's direct and rather puritanical manner appealed to the rank and file in the east in a way that Mr Steinkuhler's suave and haughty style did not. For the new, more aggressive generation of German business leaders, Mr Zwickel will be just as formidable an opponent as his predecessor, especially as the union tries to push into new, white-collar areas to compensate for a shrinking blue-collar base. Many of those employers believe that the more conciliatory noises emerging recently from IG Metall's glass box headquarters in Frankfurt are too little, too late. Some employers are already seeking more flexible local deals outside the central bargaining system, although most want to stay with the national agreement. The unwritten rule that wages rise in line with prices, plus a share of productivity, has served many of them well. But many employers now argue there must be further decentralisation and labour flexibility if Germany is to compete, pointing to the yawning difference in wage costs in Germany and elsewhere in Europe: hourly wages in Hungary (in D-Mark terms) are one-tenth the German level and in Estonia one-hundredth. Mr Zwickel retorts that the German system fosters high skill and adaptability and, that on unit labour costs - combining costs and productivity - Germany is still cheaper than Britain, France and Italy and only slightly dearer than the US and Japan. Even if Germany can remain competitive with western rivals, the attractions of low-wage eastern Europe mean that German companies are already moving jobs and investments east. The fear is, therefore, that Germany is now seeing not just recession-related job losses, but also more permanent structural unemployment. Mr Zwickel dismisses the current demand by employers for a return to the 40-hour week, which he claims would increase unemployment by 800,000. Employer pressure to hold down the wages of unskilled labour and to negotiate at the plant level with more company-friendly works councils rather than the national union may be more difficult to resist. Works councils are usually dominated by union members, but have been ahead of the national union in backing flexible working time arrangements. Thanks to that flexibility, the union can now boast that, as the working week has been cut, the running time of machines has actually increased. Mr Zwickel says that many employers have failed to exhaust the existing flexibility on working time. 'We reject a debate which is focused only on labour costs because we believe that 70 to 80 per cent of our problems stem from encrusted management structures,' says Mr Zwickel, who is keen to improve product quality with 'intelligent' team-working. He is not always sweet reason. The 12 requests by companies to implement the 'hardship' clauses and thus to escape the overall wage agreement in east Germany have been rejected by the union. Six of them have now been ruled as justified by arbitrators - it is up to the union to decide if it accepts the ruling. IG Metall may have held the line so far on its national agreements, but pressures on the union will remain intense. The union is at the cutting edge of the restructuring challenge facing the whole of German industry. It is not only German industry and the employers that have to adapt, IG Metall has to learn to juggle its inclination towards consensus and its desire to preserve traditional collective bargaining rights.</p>

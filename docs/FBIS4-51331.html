			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Chen Feng (7115 7364): "Tendency Toward </F> Boastfulness and Exaggeration Is Sweeping Across the Mainland "]    [Text] The "tendency of boastfulness and exaggeration" is  an intrinsic characteristic of the Communist Party of China;  however, boastfulness and exaggeration is the "formidable enemy"  of statistics. The communists declare themselves to be the  disciple of Lenin who once said that "statistics is a weapon to  understand society." Since this is so, it should be regarded as  a field of science which permits no "dishonesty, boastfulness,  or exaggeration." Communist governments at different levels  have all set up statistical departments--statistical  bureaus--and they now also periodically make the statistical  figures known to the public, but God knows whether these figures  are reliable or not. For instance, the inflation rates  published by the statistical departments of the communists are  extremely unreliable. They said that last year's inflation rate  on the mainland was ten-odd percent, but the actual feeling of  common people is that it is far more than that. As they went to  the market for necessities every day, they know best how much  prices have soared.  <H5>  Boastfulness and Exaggeration in the Statistical Work </H5>   It is unfair to say that the communist authorities know  nothing about this unreliability of their statistics. In his  report entitled "Statistics Is a Key Link in the Economic  Construction," delivered to a national conference on statistical  work held on February 23 this year, Zou Jiahua, vice premier of  the State Council, acknowledged boastfulness and exaggeration in  current statistical work, which could be rather serious in  certain departments and localities. Some people talk big and  indulge in empty talk, while others submit false information and  publish imaginary figures; but they are pleased with themselves.  It is a manifestation of corruption in the party's working  style. Mr Zou said that the reasons for fraud and deception in  the statistical work were as follows:    1) The relevant departments and their leaders in the Central  Committee fail to have a solid grasp of and control over this  work and neglect authenticity in statistical work and hence  should be liable for this tendency.    2) There exist problems in the guiding ideology of local  competent authorities with respect to their statistical work.    3) The influence of party working style and social  tendencies.    4) A strict system and rational and effective rules and  regulations for statistical work have been erroneously abandoned  and violated.    5) Bureaucracy in certain administrative and supervisory  authorities leads to failure in work, and    6) No importance has been attached to the solution of the  problems that cropped up in the process of construction, opening  up, and economic reform to bring back the working style of  faithfulness and practicality.    Also at this national conference of statistical work, Lu  Peijian, commissioner of the Central Auditing Department, made  known the following results of sampling and investigation  concerning taxation and statistics conducted in the last quarter  of last year and January this year by various provinces,  localities and enterprises: -- Considerable discrepancies  exist between the growth of the national economy and the actual  fulfillment of various production targets as reported by  governments of the eight provinces and autonomous regions and  the 20 major prefectures and cities, with some discrepancies as  high as 25 percent, -- As many as 12 provinces and autonomous  regional and 20 major prefectures and cities failed to suspend  or reduce the scale and progress of capital construction as they  reported to the central government, -- Inconsistency exists  between the actual quantity, scale, and capital availability of  the joint ventures of 12 provinces or autonomous regions and 28  prefectures or cities and the figures contained in the  statements submitted by such joint ventures, -- Inflation rate  of the nine provinces or autonomous regions is five to eight  percent higher than the real figures they submitted to the State  Council, and -- Of the total production value of national  economy in 1993 as submitted by the ten provincial and  autonomous regional and the 25 prefectural or municipal  governments, 3 to 12 percent are imaginary numbers.  <H5>  "What the Superiors Are Fond of, The Subordinates Will Be </H5> Addicted To"    Although the authorities of the CPC have perceived the  boastfulness and exaggeration with respect to statistics  submitted by their subordinates, suffered from the "tendency of  boastfulness and exaggeration" and are eager to correct this  tendency, the trouble still exists that up till now there are  still no effective countermeasures. It is a result of "being  hard to change the original nature" of the "tendency of  boastfulness and exaggeration." As the old saying goes in a  Chinese history book, "What the superiors are fond of, the  subordinates will be addicted to". Where the superiors are  happy with success, the subordinates will of course report only  their achievements rather than their setbacks, let alone the  fact that the superiors often appraise the work of their  subordinates on the basis of the so-called achievements reported  by the latter.</p>

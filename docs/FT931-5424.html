			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent easier after Buba statement WHILE the Bundesbank's constancy did not surprise, some bourses reflected a disappointment, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT fell back in expectation of the Bundesbank's announcement after the close with some analysts commenting that the market now felt a lack of direction. The DAX index finished 6.33 lower at 1,687.40 as turnover fell to DM6.3bn from DM8.1bn. Schering was one of the day's strong performers, rising DM9.50 to DM745.50 on hopes that a drug for multiple sclerosis, which will be the first of its kind, will gain approval from the US Federal Drugs Administration later this month. In contrast Siemens weakened DM2.20 to DM662.80. Mr Glen Liddy, a German analyst at Kleinwort Benson in London, said that the stocks current discount to the market was unjustified given forecasts of a modest earnings recovery in 1993. He added that the stock had been oversold on the basis of a poor order book at the end of last year: this had changed substantially in recent weeks with big orders coming from India and Hong Kong. PARIS had a volatile day with the CAC-40 index moving between a day's high of 2,007 and a low of 1,978 before closing down 8.49 at 1,986.75 in turnover of some FFr3.5bn. Peugeot lost FFr31 to FFr590 as the view gathered momentum that this year will be extremely tough for the sector and further negative reports were published. Michelin slipped FFr3.80 to FFr179.70. In spite of reporting its first ever loss due to taking provisions on property holdings Suez closed up FFr8.60 at FFr305.00. Some analysts commented that while the results had been dreadful there was speculation that the chairman might leave allowing a change in the shareholding structure, with UAP being mentioned. Lafarge lost FFr16.50 to FFr340.00 on disappointing results from its bioactivities division. Axa gained FFr28 to FFr1,272, supported by recent results from Equitable Life. AMSTERDAM reflected a slight sense of relief that Philips' results were more or less in line with expectations. The CBS Tendency index advanced 1.1 to 101.0 as Philips added Fl 1.10 to Fl 22.50. Analysts pointed to the weakness of the consumer electronics division and the group's need to take a further Fl 1.2bn of restructuring provisions. Polygram put on Fl 1.70 to Fl 48.90. DSM's results did not surprise as the group halved the dividend and the shares put on Fl 1.60 to Fl 73.20, still down 4.5 per cent since the start of the week. Akzo gained 70 cents to Fl 73.20. Heineken, which released solid figures just after the close, was Fl 1.20 firmer at Fl 187.50. MILAN resumed its upward trend after Wednesday's pause with much of the interest again centring on blue chips that have lagged this year's rally. The Comit index rose 3.58 to 536.72. Olivetti found support, fixing L108 higher at L2,448 before easing to L2,440 after hours. Analysts suggested variously that the group will benefit from more stable prices in the PC market; that the share was the subject of general rotation among stocks; and that the buying could be linked to Olivetti's accord with Digital Equipment of the US last year which provided for the US company to buy 9.5m Olivetti shares by this June. Retailer Rinascente rose L310 to L8,710 as old rumours resurfaced of its imminent sale by Fiat. The car maker fixed L99 ahead to L6,000 before slipping to L5,970 after hours. Sip bucked the trend, falling L57 or 3.2 per cent on the telematic system to L1,706 on rumours of a possible rights issue. ZURICH was little changed in moderate trading and the SMI index edged 2.5 lower to 2,139.5. CS Holding, the most active stock, firmed SFr30 to SFr2,260 ahead of today's Credit Suisse press conference at which it is expected to report a slightly higher profit for 1992. Roche certificates were firmer in early active trade but they slipped to close unchanged at SFr4,010. BRUSSELS eased although Banque Bruxelles Lambert gained BFr150 or 4.5 per cent to BFr3,450 after forecasting strong earnings recovery in 1993. The Bel-20 index shed 4.80 to 1,204.71 in turnover of BFr1.3bn. ISTANBUL added 3.7 per cent, after Wednesday's 3.1 per cent rise, on favourable February inflation reports and three-month auction results. The market index closed up 213.21 at 6,027.18 after Wednesday's 176.72 point rise.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices March 4 THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          Open    10.30     11.00    12.00 FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1160.60  1157.76   1156.66  1156.91 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1222.74  1219.11   1217.73  1216.54  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         13.00     14.00     15.00    Close FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1155.03   1159.05   1157.38  1156.15 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1215.04   1220.14   1218.63  1216.30  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Mar 3     Mar 2     Mar 1    Feb 26    Feb 25 FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1158.99   1156.71   1158.20   1139.80   1125.06 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1221.03   1211.84   1213.57   1194.07   1178.13  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 - 1160.80; 200 - 1223.03 Low/day: 100 - 1154.05  200 - 1214.41.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

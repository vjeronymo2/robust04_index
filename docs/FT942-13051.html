			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Pensions industry probes its future The National Association of Pension Funds, the industry trade body, is to fund an independent inquiry into long-term pension provision and has pledged to publish its findings even if they could harm its members' interests. Mr Ron Amy, association chairman, said it was making the unusual move because 'there is a danger that vested interest and ideology will drive the debate about pensions; the purpose is to make sure that the policy formation process is well-informed.' Mr Amy said the government's drive to promote personal pensions 'was about making everybody into mini-capitalists,' and did not sufficiently consider whether it was achieving better pension coverage for the lowest cost. Mr Amy did not disclose the cost of the inquiry, which will be headed by Sir John Anson, former second permanent secretary to the Treasury, who retired in 1990. Sir John said yesterday: 'Today's decisions on pensions policy will affect those who retire in the first half of the next century. The purpose of the inquiry is to consider whether changes need to be made to provide a stable and affordable structure for pension provision in the long term which will enable people to make informed choices with confidence.' Among the inquiry board's members are Mr Andrew Dilnot, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, which has recommended ending the provision that allows for a tax-free lump sum to be available on retirement. The association has strongly opposed this. Also taking part are Mr Terry Banks, chief researcher on a report for the Carnegie Institute on old age; Lady Wilcox, who chairs the National Consumer Council; Mr John Harris, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses; Mr Roger Lyons, general secretary of the MSF general technical union; and Mr Giovanni Tambur, co-ordinator of the European Commission Observation Network of Occupational Pensions. The review will consider the roles taken in the industry of the state, employers and individuals. Pension Fund Investment, separate section</p>

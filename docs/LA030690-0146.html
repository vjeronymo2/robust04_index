			<p><P> March 6, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PFIZER STOCK FALLS ON RUMORS OF WHISTLE-BLOWERS' PLANS  </P> <P> The stock of Pfizer Inc. fell sharply Monday on rumors that former company  employees are planning to testify before Congress that the firm tried to cover  up problems related to heart valves made by Shiley Inc., an Irvine subsidiary.  </P> <P> The price of Pfizer stock dropped $2.375 to close at $59.375 in trading on the  New York Stock Exchange. A spokesman for Pfizer, a giant New York-based  pharmaceutical company, said there was "no basis" to the allegations of a  cover-up.  </P> <P> Two heart valve models Shiley manufactured have been the subject of recent  hearings before Congress. The valves, which are no longer on the market, have  malfunctioned and have been linked to 272 deaths. More than 85,000 Bjork Shiley  heart valves of the kinds that have failed were sold between 1979 and 1986.  </P> <P> Pfizer's stock has been volatile in recent weeks as word circulated that a  subcommittee chaired by Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Michigan) would release  derogatory information about the company. In a recent report, the subcommittee  concluded that Pfizer had failed to maintain acceptable manufacturing and  safety standards.  </P> <P> The subcommittee also put blame on the Food and Drug Administration for taking  too long to force the valve off the market, and it criticized Pfizer for  dragging its feet in reporting incidents of valve failures to the FDA.  </P> <P> Monday's stock activity was linked to rumors that Prudential-Bache drug analyst  Barbara Ryan reported that she had been contacted by an ex-Pfizer employee who  said a group of former employees planned to provide information about a  cover-up to a congressional subcommittee investigating the Shiley valve.  </P> <P> The identities of the whistle-blowers rumored to have more information to give  the subcommittee are apparently not known even to Prudential-Bache, which could  not be reached Monday for comment.  </P> <P> Bruce Finzen, a lawyer in the Michigan office of Robins, Kaplan, Miller &amp;  Ciresi, a law firm representing numerous patients with valve implants who are  suing Pfizer, said Barbara Dreyfus, an assistant to Ryan, called Monday to ask  whether he knew who the ex-employees were who had contacted Ryan. He told her  he did not.  </P> <P> Reuters contributed to this report.  </P></p>

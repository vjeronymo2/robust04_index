Trollers using flashers with night crawlers, or  swimming minnows, to get their attention. Few catfish on Power Bait while  fishing for trout. Bass fishing fading for winter.  </P> <P> BULLHEAD CITY -- Trout highly active, running from 3/4-pound to three pounds.  For stripers, try the lake in early morning in dam area, with white sassy shad  and chrome rattletraps.  </P> <P> SALTON SEA -- Corvina biting best between state park headquarters and Salt  Creek, 4-6-pound average, using talapia minnows or trolling with thin fins.

Tom Thomas,  San Fernando, caught three on night crawlers at Serrano. Crappie also starting  on mini-jigs and meal worms. Fishing picking up as water temperature drops.  </P> <P> LAKE PIRU -- Lake turning over from bass to trout as water cools. Anglers  trolling lead-core line, three to four colors deep, using red and rainbow  needlefish. Stillfishing good with Power Bait. A few bass up to 1 3/4 pounds. A  few catfish up to six pounds.  </P> <P> LAKE CASTAIC -- Michael Calloway, Pacoima, 9 1/2-pound catfish on meal worm.  Bass deep.

Sal Mennuti, Irvine, 9 1/4-pound trout on night crawler. Rudy Benton,  Orange, seven-pound sturgeon, on shrimp from boat near flats.

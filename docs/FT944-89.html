			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Tut, tut, another lovely war: War and Peace (The next 50 years: local wars or global threat?) - Joe Rogaly on the sad truths and tragedies which those who shirk armed conflict must recognise In the west we think differently about everything now, particularly about war and peace. Differently? In just a handful of years we have moved from terrified to dangerously complacent. The present century has been the bloodiest yet; before it was half way through millions of people, soldiers and civilians alike, had died in the two most horrendous conflicts in recorded history. Yet memories of both are fading. That is only half the story. During the 45 years following the end of the second world war many, perhaps most of us, lived in trembling or fatalistic anticipation of a third, final, thermonuclear, Gotterdammerung. Now the dark mushroom cloud of foreboding, which dominated our thoughts for so long, has vanished. A fundamental transformation of the global outlook is proceeding, and at a dizzying pace. In just a few months, on May 8, VE day, the Atlantic community will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the end of the second great war in Europe. Shortly afterwards, in August, most countries will commemorate the end of the war in the Pacific, VJ day. Perhaps that is an inadequate sobriquet, for the victory over Japan was the first and so far the only occasion on which the atom bomb was deployed in anger. Can we really believe that the nuclear weapon will never be used again? That sounds like tempting fate. Yet something final, a drawing of a line, may be achieved by ritual recognition of the passage of half-a-century since the first VE and VJ days. The youngest of the combatants able to fight in the 1939-45 war are approaching 70 years of age; when the newborns of 1995 reach maturity there will be hardly any second world war veterans left. Total war, the mobilisation of entire nations, the willingness of dictators to sacrifice their own people, is no longer in prospect in the rich, developed countries of the world. The very concept belongs to the nightmare decades, the 1930s and 1940s. Future generations will not carry the European wars in their imaginations, as many of us, the passing throng, still do. As to the next 50 years, prediction is a mug's game. Yet it is possible to build a case for optimism. Since November 9, 1989, when the Berlin Wall fell, it has been a comfort to reflect that the threat of mutual annihilation implicit in the cold war was itself a guarantor of peace. Neither the Soviet Union nor the US was willing to provoke the other to the extent that nuclear rockets would be fired. There were localised battles, such as in Korea and Vietnam, but these were expressions of the cold war, complicated by anti-colonialism. Globally, the bomb kept the peace. The subsequent disintegration of the USSR has been accompanied by a fragmentation of western strategic thinking. Initially some of us settled into the consoling thought that if there was to be a single superpower, none could be more benign than the US. Uncle Sam had looked after Europe for 50 years; the world would henceforth be a safer place under a Pax Americana. The view seemed to be vindicated when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990. President Bush, his resolve stiffened by the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher, assembled a mighty multinational fighting force under the UN flag. With the use of 'smart' weapons it minimised its own casualties and achieved its stated objective, the withdrawal of Iraqi soldiers to their home territory. The Pax Americana ended there. The unstated aim of the Gulf force, the overthrow of president Saddam, was not achieved. Subsequent peacekeeping expeditions in Somalia and Rwanda likewise failed, despite the deployment of US troops in the first instance and US logistical support in the second. As to former Yugoslavia, the initial American view was that this was a European war, a test-bed of the unity of purpose of the member-states of the European Union. In the event, Bosnia has been the quagmire into which all pretensions have sunk. The UN is exposed as at worst harmful to the interests of the populations it was sent to protect, at best ineffective. Nato, which still seeks a post-cold war reason for its existence, has been revealed as what it has become: an ageing eunuch. Britain and France, the leading suppliers of UN troops, have been held hostage by the expansionist Serbs. Germany and the US, original occupants of the moral high ground, sent no troops of their own but helped tangle the EU and the others in arguments about aims, objectives, the means of reaching them, and how much Moslem land would buy off the aggressors. Those who argued at the very beginning that the UN ought to go into former Yugoslavia with a force as strong as that deployed in the Gulf, or not at all, have been proved correct. The troops who were sent, some of whom have given their lives, have been increasingly frustrated in their efforts to provide humanitarian aid. Bosnia has revealed the impotence of the post cold war international community. This, you might ask, is the case for optimism? The answer depends upon where you are sitting. If it is in a rich country, the TV ahead of you, food and drink by your side, you may not feel directly threatened by the few wars that flicker across the screen, not the ones adumbrated above, not Bosnia, not the Russian bombing in Chechnya, not any of the other 30 or so untelevised but nevertheless real armed conflicts listed by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, Sipri. These are in remote places, many in poor countries. If a camera crew is sent, you might wince at what is shown and cry 'something must be done', but most of us are unlikely to support anything bearing a price calibrated in our own blood, or that of our children. As to money, our consciences allow for donations, but not too much. This picture is consonant with the much-criticised thesis adumbrated by Francis Fukuyama in a book entitled The end of history and the last man (1992). The essence of Mr Fukuyama's case is that democracies do not go to war with one another, and that, since liberal democracy is spreading, the risk of war is diminishing. A variant of the Fukuyama theme, by Max Singer and Aaron Wildavsky, divides the world into stable, wealthy democracies and the rest. The former are peaceful, the latter not. Other specialists in global prognostication have written along similar lines. Common sense suggests that the general proposition may be correct, at least for the next decade or so. Voters in democracies have a say over whether they, or their sons and daughters, may be used as cannon-fodder. They will pay for wars when there is a direct threat to their own nation, but rarely otherwise. The triumph of the free market, of economic liberalism, may have resulted in the replacement of nationalistic fervour by a preoccupation with creating wealth. In some areas, according to Lawrence Freedman, writing in Brassey's Defence Yearbook, 1994, the liberal economic order 'can channel old rivalries into creative competition and though it can also spark disputes, the context tends to be one in which military instruments appear inappropriate'. Professor Freedman, head of the department of war studies at King's College, London, warns that this does not guarantee stability. He must be right, yet the initial proposition stands. The prosecution of mercantile interests by the sword has become irrational since the followers of Adam Smith convinced us that international trade can benefit all participants. The Anglo-American drive towards minimalist government elevates the pursuit of comparative economic advantage above dreams of empire, or conquest of neighbouring territories. The near-universal unpopularity of elected politicians may protect us from the dangers of finding ourselves in thrall to a manic leader, prone to warmongering. Such arguments may assure the TV viewer in the developed world. It does nothing for the victims of the many extant wars noted by Sipri. The institute's 1995 list, recording conflicts in 1994, is in preparation. It seems that renewed fighting in the Yemen will be added to the roll, while South Africa, Northern Ireland, Georgia, Croatia, and the Kurdish north of Iraq may be on their way to reclassification as peaceful. Sipri recognises all conflicts in which 1,000 or more deaths have been caused. In some, such as Afghanistan, more than a million people have been killed; in most others the casualties are measured in tens of thousands. Yet the developing regional pattern supports the peace-through-democracy thesis. South and central America, in which liberal democracy is spreading rapidly, may fall right off the Sipri tables within a year or two. The danger spots are, unsurprisingly, parts of the former Soviet Union, parts of Africa and the Middle East. As to the last, the US will presumably intervene if oil supplies are threatened, or if Saddam foolishly tries to invade Kuwait again or, in theory, if Israel's existence is imperilled. In each case the US president would be under strong domestic pressure from economic or political interest groups. He might be obliged to act, and even the present neo-isolationist Congress would find it difficult to withhold its consent. That, however, is it. Expect nothing more from the US, and less from the Europeans. When other local conflicts occur we are likely to see more hand-wringing, more conferences of this or that European, Asian, or global security organisation, but little that actually helps to end the fighting. Most of the world's small wars are internal battles between insurgents and a government, or between rival ethnic claimants to territory. The idea that the UN, or anyone else, should intervene in such cases is relatively new. Yet when people are starving, or ethnic cleansing is used as a euphemism for genocide, the natural human urge to aid the victims is intense. The need for rescue is especially great in Africa, where post-colonial bloodletting is not yet over. Some see no relief to the gloom. Robert Kaplan, writing in the February issue of the Atlantic Monthly, argued that West Africa 'is becoming the symbol of worldwide demographic, environmental, and societal stress, in which criminal anarchy emerges as the real 'strategic' danger'. Mr Kaplan, who is expanding his article into a book, apparently sees the continent retreating into chaos, internecine strife, and bloody anarchy. Carol Lancaster has challenged this apocalyptic vision. Writing for the Center for Strategic and International Studies, the deputy administrator of the US Agency for International Development points out that many states in Africa suffer from rapid population growth, environmental degradation and poverty but do not collapse into ungovernability. The reason is that they are better governed than others. She cites Botswana and Ghana. Even if Lancaster is right, Kaplan's imagination stretches beyond West Africa. He is one among many who regard the dangers facing the developing countries as global threats. Rootless gangs, perhaps financed by drug sales, may become international terrorists. One or another such group may eventually acquire a nuclear weapon. This possibility can only be shrugged off by the complacent. A conference on the extension of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty of 1970 is due next year. What should it decide? Ryukichi Imai, professor of social sciences at Kyorin University describes the potential for the acquisition or manufacture of nuclear weapons by small countries. Writing in the Japan Review of International Affairs, he seems to envisage a super-NPT, imposing conditions beyond 'the normal stipulation of arms control measures . . . far beyond voluntary restraints on export control of sensitive technologies'. There are other possible causes of conflict. The southern border of the US and the southern and eastern borders of the EU are increasingly firmly policed. President Clinton's intervention in Haiti was partly a defence against an influx of destitute boat people. Migration from poor countries to their rich neighbours could lead to other such actions or, worse, to the emergence of xenophobic, non-democratic governments. In sum, sitting back and tut-tutting about the tragedies of the insecure quarters of the globe is profitable short-term politics. That is all that can be said for it.</p>

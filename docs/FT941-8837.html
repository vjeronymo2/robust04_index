			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Upturn in rubber demand forecast Use of synthetic rubber by the former Soviet republics and China, Vietnam and North Korea is likely to rise sharply over the next five years, according to a report by the International Institute of Synthetic Rubber Producers. The Houston-based trade association said it expected worldwide consumption to increase by 22 per cent to more than 11m tonnes in 1998, after a 6.6 per cent fall induced by recession last year. Growth in synthetic rubber consumption in the Commonwealth of Independent States would jump by 90 per cent, partly reflecting a bounce back from a 37 per cent fall last year caused by economic difficulties. China, Vietnam and North Korea would use 34 per cent more synthetic rubber, which is used particularly for tyres and tyre products. The institute also predicts that consumption of natural rubber will rise by an annual rate of 3.2 per cent over the next five years. The former Soviet republics, which used to favour synthetic, would see particularly strong growth. 'As the region trends toward a more traditional balance between synthetic and natural rubber, 1994 growth in natural rubber consumption is expected to be 20 per cent,' said Mr Conrad Jankowski, managing director.</p>

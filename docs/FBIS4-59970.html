			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From "Letters to the Editor"] </F>   [Text] Mr. Chief Editor:    Greetings,    With reference to the report published yesterday on the  formation of a new Government in Syria under "Major General"  Hikmat al-Shihabi, I would like to clarify the following:    First: The report was datelined ""Damascus, AL-DUSTUR" which  suggests that I was its source. This is untrue. I had nothing  to do with that report.    Second: It seems that the report did not originate from  Damascus in the first place. The chief of staff in Syria holds  the rank of a "lieutenant general" and not a "major general," as  mentioned in the report. This makes one conclude that the  author of the report is very far from understanding Syrian  affairs.    Third: Lieutenant General Hikmat al-Shihabi is widely  respected among all Syrian and non-Syrian circles. I find it  inappropriate to mention his name just like that whenever one  wants to talk about the a government formation.    Fourth: There is nothing in Syrian political circles to  suggest any potential reshuffle in the current Syrian  Government, which is headed by Engineer Mahmud al-Zu'bi,  especially since it recorded several achievements which cannot  be mentioned here.    Sixth [as published]: The concerned circles in Damascus have  not commented on this report. Nor have they reacted to similar  reports published in the past.    I will be grateful if you publish this clarification. With  my best regards.    [Signed] 'Ali Jamalu, AL-DUSTUR correspondent in Damascus</p>

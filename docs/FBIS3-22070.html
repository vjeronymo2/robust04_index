			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "A Dangerous Indian Conspiracy"] </F>   [Text] Interior Minister Nasirullah Babar addressed a news  conference and disclosed that India, through its agents, is  smuggling chemicals used in the processing of heroin into tribal  areas of Pakistan and that the Federal Investigation Agency has  seized 92 kg of a chemical, sufficient for producing 736 kg of  heroin, in a raid on the Atari-Lahore Samjhauta Express train.  Giving details of this Indian conspiracy to defame Pakistan, the  minister called upon the international community to use its  influence to check India from indulging in such shameful  activities.    There can be no difference of opinion on the question of  India's hostility toward Pakistan. It has not accepted Pakistan  from the very beginning, and that is why it never misses any  opportunity to malign Pakistan on any issue. In the past too, a  large quantity of chemical used in heroin processing was seized  from the Samjhauta Express train, but the parties involved in  this trade later tried to cover it up as a chemical openly sold  in the Akbari market. Now that it has been fully proved that  India is smuggling chemicals into Pakistani territory, including  its tribal areas, not only through the Samjhauta Express but  also through its agents, the government should take stringent  measures to check this smuggling. It should also take video of  such seizures and show it to the international community with  documentary proof thereof, so the world can see the black side  of the Indian character and realize to what extent India can go  to fulfill its unholy ambitions and abominable designs.</p>

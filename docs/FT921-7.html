			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Non-discounting Alexon down to Pounds 11.3m ALEXON GROUP, the specialist fashion retailer, suffered its first fall in profits since 1985, as it refused to join the legions of discounters in a high-street price war. It demerged from Claremont Garments, the Marks and Spencer supplier, in July last year. Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 12.8m to Pounds 11.3m for the year to January 25. However, the previous year's figures comprise just 43 weeks to January 26 1991, as Alexon changed its year-end to fall into line with the retailing sector. The effort to hold margins and the dearth of business in the high street resulted in an 8 per cent like-for-like drop in sales. Operating profits, cushioned by a Pounds 400,000 gain on a pension charge reduction, dropped by 19 per cent to Pounds 12.6m on an annualised basis. Mr Lawrence Snyder, chairman, said Alexon was serving the long-term interests of its three brands - Alexon, Eastex and Dash - by refusing to join the discounters. However, the drop in sales as buyers went for bargains had depressed operating margins from 12 to 11 per cent. Gross margins remained unchanged. Mr Snyder said it was unlikely the company could increase margins through more cost-cutting. 'The opportunity is not there,' he said. 'We need sales growth this year to increase profits.' Alexon took a Pounds 6.32m extraordinary charge, largely due to ending Dash Junior, the ill-starred foray into the children's leisurewear market. Of the three brands, only Eastex, the relaunched clothing range aimed at the shorter, older woman, had increased sales and profits. It was trading well following its move towards the younger - aged 50 - target consumer. Alexon, the classic womens-wear range, suffered its first decline since 1983, said Mr Snyder. Turnover in Alexon, which caters to the working woman aged 30-plus, fell by 10 per cent and profits slightly more. Of the three brands, margin defence was most important to this upmarket range, Mr Snyder said. Finally, Dash, the men's and women's leisurewear brand, also reported a decline. Mr Snyder said Alexon planned to increase the range of clothing, including a new collection by Ms Rosemary Conley, author of Hip and Thigh Diet. During the year, the company increased floor space by 4 per cent. Capital expenditure of Pounds 4m would remain about the same this year. Fully diluted earnings per share, including the Pounds 1.5m exceptional gain in 1990/91, fell from 31.24p to 22.11p, on an annualised basis. The final dividend was 7.6p, making a total of 10.6p.</p>

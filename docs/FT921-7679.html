			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Cumbrian opencast mining to end BRITISH COAL is to phase out its opencast mining in Cumbria because of the highly competitive nature and uncertain future of its markets, the corporation announced yesterday. The decision, which will cause 300 direct job losses over the next five years, underlines the difficulties British Coal faces in competing against new gas-fired power stations and cheap imported coal. Opencast coal mining has until now been seen as a highly profitable activity which has helped buoy up the corporation's overall financial performance. Last year its opencast operations made a Pounds 160m profit on a Pounds 700m turnover. Cumbria is the first coalfield where British Coal has said it intends to cease opencasting. Since the closure in the mid 1980s of Haig Colliery, Cumbria's last deep coal mine, British Coal has extracted about 1m tonnes of opencast coal annually from west Cumbria. It announced yesterday that it is to go ahead with a large new opencast contract at Broughton Lodge, near Workington, but is suspending all future site development work. Its Cumbria offices near Workington, employing about 12 management and supervisory staff, are to close. Most of the staff will be offered immediate voluntary redundancy, with the remainder moving to a cabin office on the new opencast site. Broughton Lodge will mean the corporation will have three working sites in Cumbria. British Coal Opencast directly employs 300 people in west Cumbria; its sites also support about 300 sub-contract and haulage jobs. A corporation spokesman said about 70 direct jobs a year would go from 1993. Geological conditions and transport costs had led to the conclusion that Cumbria was marginal in terms of viability. 'By 1997 the Cumbrian coalfield will have come to a halt unless the price of coal rockets,' he said.</p>

			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SUCCULENT HAM PERKS UP EASTER DINNER TABLE  </P> <P> Easter is a family time when relatives come together to share the joy of a  special spring day. It is also the time of year when many cooks spend hours  laboring in the kitchen over an impressive meal, the nucleus of which is almost  always a ham. Whether one chooses a fully cooked or a fresh ham, it's sure to  provide a savory entree for Easter feasting.  </P> <P> How did the traditional Easter ham originate? Years ago, the curing, smoking  and aging process was necessary for the preservation of meat. Hogs were  butchered during winter, when hams were cured, then hung in smokehouses to age  throughout the season. It was believed that the ham had sufficiently aged by  the arrival of spring (which comfortably coincided with Easter). Thus, ham  found its way to the dinner table for special Easter celebrations.  </P> <P> Here are three glazed, baked hams that will brighten your Easter dinner table.  Fresh asparagus and hot baked bread are perfect complements.  </P> <P> HONEY-ORANGE GLAZED HAM  </P> <P> 1 orange  </P> <P> 1 cup honey  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves  </P> <P> 1 (8- to 10-pound) fully cooked whole boneless ham  </P> <P> Fresh watercress, optional  </P> <P> Carefully remove zest from orange in long strips and reserve zest. Squeeze  orange, reserving 2 tablespoons juice. Combine reserved juice, honey, cinnamon  and cloves in small bowl and mix well.  </P> <P> Place ham on rack in shallow roasting pan. Insert meat thermometer into  thickest part of ham, not touching fat or bone. Bake, uncovered, at 325 degrees  2 to 2 1/2 hours or until thermometer registers 135 to 140 degrees, basting  with glaze during last 45 minutes cooking time. Garnish with orange zest and  watercress. Makes 24 to 30 servings.  </P> <P> APPLE-GLAZED BAKED HAM  </P> <P> 1 (5- to 7-pound) shank half smoked ham  </P> <P> 1/2 cup apple jelly  </P> <P> Place ham, fat side up, on rack in open roasting pan. Insert roast meat  thermometer in thickest part of ham, not touching fat or bone. Do not add  water. Bake, uncovered, at 325 degrees until thermometer registers 130 degrees  for fully cooked half ham (18 to 24 minutes per pound) or 160 degrees for  cook-before-eating half ham (22 to 25 minutes per pound).  </P> <P> Meanwhile, melt jelly over low heat. Brush ham with melted jelly during last 20  minutes baking time. Makes about 12 servings.  </P> <P> ORANGE-CHERRY GLAZED HAM  </P> <P> 1 (5- to 7-pound) shank half smoked ham  </P> <P> 3/4 cup cherry preserves  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon orange juice  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon grated orange zest  </P> <P> Place ham, fat side up, on rack in open roasting pan. Insert roast meat  thermometer in thickest part of ham, not touching fat or bone. Do not add  water. Bake, uncovered, at 325 degrees until thermometer registers 130 to 140  degrees for fully cooked half ham (18 to 24 minutes per pound) or 160 degrees  for cook-before-eating half ham (22 to 25 minutes per pound).  </P> <P> Meanwhile, melt cherry preserves in small saucepan over medium heat. Strain  cherries from syrup, reserving syrup. Coarsely chop cherries and combine with  syrup, orange juice and zest. Brush glaze over ham during last 20 minutes  baking time. Makes 12 servings.  </P></p>

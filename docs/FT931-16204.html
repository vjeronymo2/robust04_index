			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Recovery slow for truck sales THE UK market for commercial vehicles is thought likely to experience a slowly developing recovery rather than repeat last month's surge in sales of cars, John Griffiths writes. Sales of new commercial vehicles rose 7.7 per cent last month, but that was too little to prevent sales for the year as a whole falling below 1991 levels. Sales totalled 201,186 in 1992, a drop of 3.75 per cent on the previous year's 209,021. Most manufacturers are now expecting a market increase approaching 10 per cent this year. The UK industry was unable to prevent a further small imports rise last year. Their market share rose to 36.32 per cent from 35.51 per cent in 1991.</p>

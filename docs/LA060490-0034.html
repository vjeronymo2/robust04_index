			<p><P> June 4, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC AND DANCE REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> NEUBAUER SOLOIST IN LONG BEACH SEASON FINALE  </P> <P> Looking back at JoAnn Falletta's first season as conductor of the Long Beach  Symphony, supporters of that orchestra have good reason to rejoice. Concerts  are sold out, the pre-concert lectures are well-attended, and the orchestra  plays better than ever.  </P> <P> And certainly among Falletta's triumphs is an entire season of brilliantly  planned programs. The final regular subscription program of the season --  Saturday at the Terrace Theater -- is a case in point.  </P> <P> There are those who deny the existance of a viola concerto repertoire, but  William Walton's handsomely wrought, highly original and adroitly scored  concerto disproves that immediately. Paul Neubauer, who at 27 already has  behind him a 5-year tenure as principal violist of the New York Philharmonic  (he resigned from that post about a year ago), delivered an absorbing and  utterly convincing account of the 1929 composition.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles-born violist produced a rich, warm sound and infused the  haunting melodies of the slow movements with great ardor. To the crackling  Scherzo he brought clarity and remarkable control. The orchestra supported him  with vitality and, for the most part, rhythmic security.  </P> <P> After intermission, Falletta and the orchestra brought probing depth and  telling insight to Brahms' First Symphony. The conductor paid fine attention to  detail, and textures remained clear and balances judicious -- until the very  end, where the brass were allowed to exert to the point to raucousness.  </P> <P> John Harbison's "Remembering Gatsby: Foxtrot for Orchestra" opened the program  with spirited good nature.

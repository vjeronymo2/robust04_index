			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Acquisition helps Barlo to IPounds 3.9m SALES growth and acquisition boosted pre-tax profits at Barlo Group, the Irish radiator and plastic packaging manufacturer, from IPounds 1.84m to IPounds 3.9m (Pounds 3.84m) over the 12 months to March 31. Turnover leapt from IPounds 14.7m to IPounds 49.7m, partly reflecting consolidation of IRG, a plastic packaging business, for eight months. The group reported a 35 per cent increase in radiator sales to IPounds 19.9m 'with significant gains in market share achieved in the UK, Irish and other European markets'. Net borrowings at the year end were IPounds 6.3m, representing gearing of 22 per cent. Earnings per share improved 20 per cent to 3.65p. A dividend of 0.5p is proposed for the year, the first distribution since 1989.</p>

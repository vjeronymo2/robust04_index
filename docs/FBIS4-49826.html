			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 10 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Li  Lanqing met here this afternoon with visiting Director-General  of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) Peter  Sutherland.    They exchanged opinions on China's re-entry into GATT and  some other issues of common concern.    Li said that eight years have passed since China applied for  re-entry into GATT, and now, although the Uruguay Round has  ended, the re-entry issue remains unsettled.    He said that China was a full participant in the Uruguay  Round and China advocates a balance between rights and  obligations on GATT issues.    Li noted that China, as an open country now, has to practice  trade in accordance with international rules, adding that China  is making efforts to re-enter GATT and become a founding member  of the World Trade Organization (WTO), which is due to be set up  next year, in order to meet the demands of China's economic  development and many other countries' requirements.    On market access, Li said this is a gradual procedure and  China will lower its tariffs step by step, pointing out that  along with the development of China's economy, China will  realize its commitment through its own efforts.    Touching upon the national treatment issue, Li said that the  unification of China's dual-track exchange rates is the most  profitable treatment for overseas business people.    He continued that the opening of China's service sector,  from  hotel management over 10 years ago to shops, banks and  insurance, has expanded during the past few years.    To assure healthy development of China's service sector, Li  noted that the opening of this sector should go forward step by  step, for China lacks experience and qualified personnel in this  field, adding that such an opening will be profitable for both  the Chinese and the foreign sides.    Li said that the future WTO should treat China as a  developing country, and China should never accept the standards  for developed countries.    Before the meeting, China's Minister of Foreign Trade and  Economic Cooperation Wu Yi also met with Sutherland.    Wu said that China needs the assurance of a multi-lateral  trade system and the world trade system also needs China as a  participant.    She added that, without the participation of China, WTO  would  be incomplete and would lack universality.    Sutherland said that China should become a full participant  in WTO so as to provide it with both assurance and  opportunities, and he expressed hope that both negotiating sides  would show some flexibility to achieve the anticipated results  at an early date.</p>

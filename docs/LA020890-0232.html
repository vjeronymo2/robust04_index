			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> ISRAELI RIOT DEVICE THROWS GRAVEL  </P> <P> In its latest effort to halt rioting in the occupied territories, the Israeli  army has introduced a jeep-mounted gravel thrower that spews out 600 egg-sized  rocks a minute, Israel radio said today.  </P> <P> The battery-powered device weighs 66 pounds, can be mounted on a jeep and  operated by one soldier. It can throw the egg-sized stones 75 yards, the report  said.  </P> <P> The new device is the latest addition to the army's growing anti-uprising  arsenal that also includes tear gas and various types of rubber, plastic and  metal bullets.  </P> <P> Israel has drawn international criticism for firing guns at stone-throwers,  most of them children and teen-agers. But army officials contend that troops  use live ammunition only when their lives are in danger.  </P></p>

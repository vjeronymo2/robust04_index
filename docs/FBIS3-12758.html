			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] In an editorial today, AL-BA'TH says: One can  deduce from the Israeli conduct that there is a new attempt not  only to circumvent the results of the Geneva summit, but also to  circumvent the U.S. role and all the international efforts  seeking to achieve the just and comprehensive peace in the  region.    AL-BA'TH stresses the importance of having a balanced and  effective European role in the peace process. However, the  paper warns that the Israelis' emphasis on the Europeans, from  the economic viewpoint, seeks to market the Oslo Agreement, in  which some people found an opportunity to enter the region. The  paper says: This view is based on a host of unfounded  illusions, which will harm principally the peace process and the  Europeans themselves, in view of their interests in the region  and strong ties with the Arab states. The paper wonders: Will  the European Community agree to serve as a bridge on which Rabin  can cross to hamper the peace process?    AL-BA'TH concludes by saying: Israel has on more than one  occasion tried to use the European role to its advantage. But  that role remained balanced to some extent over the issue of the  Arab-Israeli conflict. With Rabin's moves, which precede his  visit to Washington, this role should not lose its balance  because the wager on the Oslo Agreement will fail.</p>

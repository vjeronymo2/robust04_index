			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow 22 Apr -- Boris Yeltsin today cancelled his  edict "On Not Extending State Guarantees of Social Protection To  Certain Former People's Deputies of the Russian Federation."  This was the edict issued on 6 October 1993, enabling  Presidential Administration Head Sergey Filatov and a special  commission to draw up a list of 151 deputies to be deprived of  the payment of one year's salary based on the salary they were  paid in their final month as deputy. This sum amounts to about  3-4 million rubles and is being paid to each black listed deputy  from the state budget.    The issue of whether they should be allowed to keep the  Moscow flats they were allocated when working for the Supreme  Soviet is also still being debated. But on the eve of the  signing of the treaty on civil accord, the president has decided  to meet the opposition half way in order to achieve civil peace  in Russia.</p>

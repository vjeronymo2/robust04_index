The main  trend is a continuation of developments toward relaxation.  The disintegration of the Soviet Union resulted in a thorough  disintegration of the bipolar structure centered on U.S.-Soviet  confrontation. Although we still cannot say that military  confrontation between the United States and Russia has  disappeared, the degree of tension and acuteness has been  greatly decreased. The major countries of the world have  shifted their attention to economic development and increasing  their comprehensive national strength. Meanwhile, they are also  readjusting their respective military strategies. According to  information from Western research institutions, the world's  military expenditures fell by 15 percent in 1992 (the main  reason is that Russia and other CIS states, as well as the  European countries, have reduced their military expenditure by a  big margin). This is the first big reduction since the end of  World War II. Troop numbers in the various major countries have  also been reduced. At the same time, the pace of arms control  talks has been accelerated. At the beginning of this year, the  United States and Russia concluded a second stage of talks on  reducing strategic nuclear weapons. They agreed that both sides  would retain 3,000 to 3,500 strategic nuclear warheads each by  the year 2003, which means a two-thirds reduction in existing  nuclear weapons. An agreement has finally been reached on  banning chemical weapons and a convention on banning the  production, research, and use of chemical weapons and thoroughly  destroying existing chemical weapons has been signed. There is  also declining trend in the arms trade. In 1992, the volume of  arms delivered fell by 25 percent. Judging from the regional  situation, regional conflicts and limited wars, which were  affected by the contention between the two superpowers in the  past, have been scaled down. Many of them have been resolved  through political channels.    In short, the danger of world war and the possibility  of face- to-face confrontations between the big powers has been  further reduced. Relaxation is the main trend of development in  the current world military situation, and this trend is likely  to be preserved in the future.    However, on the other hand, as the post-cold war world is  entering a period of the establishment of a new international  strategic pattern, various forces are undergoing a process of  breaking up and reorganization. Factors of instability and  uncertainty in the world military situation have also increased.  Looking at the present and for a period to come, the  following characteristics merit our attention:    1. All of the world's major countries are carrying out  readjustments of their military strategies in order to suit the  new situation after the Cold War. Although they have different  emphases, a common trend is to change from making preparations  for large-scale wars to dealing with regional conflicts, and  from mainly dealing with practical military threats to mainly  dealing with potential threats. This can be seen from  their army building policies. They are all reducing troop  numbers while increasing force quality, and they are carrying  out reforms of the organizational establishment of their army  units, force structures, and command systems. They are all  trying to establish small but highly trained and highly mobile  military forces, while attaching special importance to  strengthening their navies and air forces. What merit our  attention is that the development of science and technology will  continue to play an enormous role in propelling the development  of military forces in the future. Revolutionary changes will  possibly take place in the development of military equipment or  in types of war. This was seen especially clearly during  the Gulf War. Now, while reducing forces and eliminating  obsolete equipment, various countries are concentrating their  strength on developing conventional high-tech weaponry and  equipment. For this reason, military expenditure on scientific  research is increasing in many countries. Moreover, combat  theories and techniques have also been developed. A general  trend is to stress combined arms on a larger scale and in larger  areas. Some traditional combat theories and techniques are  already outdated. In short, under condition where various  countries are reducing their forces, competition among them  regarding the quality of their military strength has begun  quietly.    2. The disintegration of the bipolar structure has led  to a serious imbalance in military strength throughout the world  and the trend of U.S. military intervention has further  developed. For a period to come, the United States will  continue to hold a dominant position in international military  affairs. Although Russia is still powerful in terms of military  strength, it is difficult for it to continue to maintain  military confrontation with the United States like the former  Soviet Union. The United States has become the only superpower  in the military sphere, capable of using military force on a  large scale in the world. This will be an important factor  affecting the military situation. At present, the United States  is resolved to "maintain a leading position in the world."  While appropriately reducing the scale of its military  deployment, it is doing its best to preserve its military  presence throughout the world. At the same time, it is trying  hard to establish a new military pattern in various regions on  the basis of the security structures of the Cold War period,  with itself at the core. The United States' dominant position  is also reflected by the increasing trend of intervention in the  affairs of other countries through its military policy.    Meanwhile, the trend of multipolarization has also  developed in the military sphere. Over the past few years,  when taking military action abroad, the United States has had to  seek assistance and support from its allies or make use of the  banner of the United Nations. This shows that although it is  powerful in terms of strength, its ability still falls short of  its wishes, and there are many restrictions. In particular, the  rise of Germany and Japan in the economic field could possibly  intensify centrifugal forces among the Western countries, which  could finally become a new challenge to the United States.  Russia, which is in the midst of deep economic and political  crises, is still declaring its wish to preserve its position as  a major world power. While reducing its military forces by a  big margin, it has preserved a plan to modernize its strategic  nuclear forces. Moreover, the vast numbers of large, medium,  and small countries also form a latent force that cannot be  neglected. In recent years, they have made positive efforts to  promote regional military cooperation in order to resist  intervention by foreign forces. Although for a short period to  come there will be no fundamental changes in contests of  military strength throughout the world, judging from a long-term  point of view, this will be an important factor promoting the  development of multipolarization in the world's military  situation.    3. With the end of Cold War, important changes have  taken place in the security concepts of many countries and the  role of economic factors in international affairs is  increasing. As various countries have shifted the focus of  their attention to domestic economic construction and have  become increasingly interdependent in the economic field, they  more frequently consider interstate relations from the angle of  economic interest. In their security policies, almost all  countries take security in economic affairs as their main  objective, while submitting military construction to the needs  of economic construction.    However, the rise of economic factors does not mean the role  of military power in international affairs is not important.  First, the role of military power is still considered seriously  by various countries, especially the major powers. In  consideration of their economic interests, some countries have  attached greater importance to the protection of offshore  resources and trade routes. After achieving successful  development in the economic field, they have accelerated the  pace of arms development. Some countries in the Asia-Pacific  region and some Arab countries in the Middle East countries have  been increasing their military expenditure over the past few  years.    Second, amid economic competition, nationalist sentiments  are  also growing. As a result, some countries have attached greater  importance to bolstering their military strength in an attempt  to make up for their inadequate economic strength and use this  as an important means to protect their interests.    Lastly, various big Western powers still regard military  strength as a deterrent force and means of attack to deal with  so-called "threats" from the Third World. Their gigantic  military industries cannot be effectively converted to civilian  production on a large scale now. As a matter of fact, these  countries still maintain very high military expenditures.    4. With the further reduction in the danger of world  war, regional armed conflicts and limited wars will become the  main form of military conflict. Since the drastic changes  in the East European countries in 1989 and the disintegration of  the Soviet Union, a number of regional conflicts have taken  place in the Balkan region along the borders of southern Europe,  which extend northwards to the former Soviet Union, forming a  new hot spot of instability. However, in general, the world  situation is developing toward relaxation, and regional  conflicts have also been restricted to a certain extent.  Generally, there situation is changeable, sometimes tense,  sometimes relaxed. Although some big powers have interfered in  or had a hand in regional conflicts, they have not sparked  military confrontation between the big powers.    Nevertheless, we cannot conclude from this that the danger  of  regional armed conflict and limited wars is not important. In  various regions of the world, potential hot spots exist, which  could lead to the involvement of major powers and regional  powers in direct military confrontation. In its new "regional  defense strategy," the United States proposes that "two limited  wars should be won simultaneously." It is also making earnest  preparations for undertaking combat operations when necessary.  Therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility of sudden  incidents occurring.</p>
